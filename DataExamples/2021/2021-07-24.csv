Keegan Bradley hit his tee shot 286 yards down the left side of the fairway. He hit his second shot from 242 yards out to 39 feet. He two-putted for birdie.

Congratulations Keegan. You did the impossible.

He hit the 585-yard par-5 18th at TPC Twin Cities in two and made a four. Which is normally possible. It’s a par-5 and PGA Tour pros make their living here. Except the 3M Open put its Saturday pin right up next to the water to the right of the green. And Blaine Minn. picked up its wind on the hole that doglegs right around that same water. And all hell broke loose.

Among the carnage:

Today's toughest test.



18th hole: +35

Rest of course: -85 pic.twitter.com/DJkALeJVR6 — PGA TOUR (@PGATOUR) July 24 2021

— The scoring average was 5.486 which ranks as the highest on a par-5 in a single round all season. Second is the 14th hole at Pebble Beach during the second round of the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am (5.286); third is the 12th at Winged Foot during the first round of the U.S. Open (5.264); and fourth is the 12th again at Winged Foot during the second round of the Open (5.252). The 18th at TPC Twin Cities on Saturday played to 35-over par — while the rest of the course played to 85 under.

— There were 12 birdies and 39 pars — and nine bogeys four double bogeys and eight “others.” And no eagles.

— The water damage. Six of the 72 players hit their tee shots in the water. Twenty-five of the players hit balls in the water at some point. CBS had reported that 28 balls were lost in the water in all after the third-to-last grouping and Adam Hadwin would add another after that.

— And among the players who teed off on No. 1 and are five shots or closer to the lead after the third round only Bradley was home in two on 18 and made birdie.

Among the individual horror stories were a 12 from Sung Kang who hit his tee shot in the water then his next shot then his next shot then his eighth stroke. Rickie Fowler who had been leading the tournament at one point took an eight. J.T. Poston and Bo Hoag each went into the water to the right of the green — literally. And Gary Woodland played the hole like this — drive 70 yards right; second shot that hit the grandstand behind the green; drop; pitch on two-putt par.

The players reacted in kind.

“It’s a tough hole” said Cameron Tringale who parred the hole and leads by one heading into Sunday’s final round. “I think if you’re out of position off the tee the layup can be a little tricky with as much wind as there is and then the third shot with the pin right in the front it’s sort of a diagonal green so it’s just tough to be 100 percent sure on the yardage. The putt from past the hole’s not really that easy because you’ve got to go up and over so I think guys are taking their chances if they hit a good drive. If you’re in the fairway on your third you’ve got to try to hit one in there. If you miss any of those three shots I think you’re in trouble.”

“Yeah. I don’t know what the wind’s going to be like” said Charl Schwartzel who parred the hole. “Today was the first day that it was borderline basically not being able to reach. I think that will be a big factor. If you’re able to reach tomorrow that can make a big difference.”

“I didn’t realize it was going to blow this much” said Pat Perez who parred the hole. “Eighteen the last two days has been so hard based on that wind. This one was blowing in off the right today and with that tucked pin on 18 that’s a hard shot no matter what shot you’re hitting second or third into the green and yesterday was pumping off the left. It’s weird. It was kind of calm all day and then all of a sudden we got to 17 and all of a sudden boom we were around the water and it was just pumping.”

And from analyst Trevor Immelman on the CBS broadcast: “Is this a par-6?

Of course this all came on Saturday. The 18th has gotten more difficult as the week has progressed — it was the third-easiest hole on Thursday and in the middle of the pack on Friday.

What should we expect on the day they cut the checks?

“It’s a great finishing hole” Woodland said. “The wind will be in again off tomorrow so it should be an exciting finish.”

Yet the pipeline between the two is proving to be a natural fit.

Just months after leaving school early to pursue a professional golf career in 2019 Matthew Wolff got into the 3M Open on a sponsor exemption then won the whole thing with a dramatic eagle on the 72nd hole. Another OSU sponsor exemption that year Viktor Hovland tied for 13th.

Sunday in Blaine playing on a sponsor exemption in just his fourth event as a pro and second made cut Austin Eckroat became the latest Cowboys golfer to break through. He shot a final-round 4-under 67 to tie for a career-best 16th place and earn $87890.

Wolff Rickie Fowler Charles Howell III and Bo Van Pelt were other OSU alums to collect a paycheck Sunday afternoon.

""This is my first time in Minnesota and I really really like it"" Eckroat said. ""It's been enjoyable. Since turning pro it's almost as if a switch went off. You kind of have to play well out here and that's helped my game out.""

So too have Wolff and Hovland.

Eckroat roomed with Wolff early in college and stayed with Hovland the past two years. When Wolff and Hovland turned pro and began dealing with travel schedules sponsors and agencies Eckroat took note.

""Matt and Viktor are really good so they play good anywhere"" he said. ""Maybe it's a fluke I've been playing good but I learned just by watching them.""

One Gopher to another

By virtue of his Saturday 75 former Gophers golfer Erik van Rooyen plummeted down the leaderboard and was in Sunday's first group off the tee. He shot 67 on a mostly empty course finishing in just under three and a half hours.

Maintenance workers and about 10 family and friends were the few witnesses as he wrapped up the tournament in a tie for 58th place at 2 under par.

""It was nice of them to come out at the break of dawn"" van Rooyen said. The tournament was ""disappointing overall from a result perspective but on the back nine we heard ""Go Gophers!"" almost every other hole so in that regard it was really fun to be back.""

At least van Rooyen got four rounds in after missing the cut here last summer. That was the fate this week for recent Gophers graduate Angus Flanagan who sunk to 11 over by Friday evening. Flanagan has yet to make a cut in four professional tournaments two on the PGA Tour.

Van Rooyen is nine years older than Flanagan but the two are close.

""Angus had a wonderful Minnesota career and there can be a lot of expectations on you"" van Rooyen said. ""A part of it is a little self-inflicted. He just needs to chill. He has all the game in the world to be a fantastic pro golfer. I get the sense he feels he needs to come out and smash and win everything. That's not necessary. He needs to find his feet and he'll do that. He'll be just fine.""

Old pals

Gary Woodland had dinner with Kansas pal and former Timberwolf Cole Aldrich before he left town with an 11th place finish in the 3M Open.

""He's taking credit I can promise you that"" Woodland said. ""It was good to see him. I hadn't seen Cole in a long time. Us Jayhawks have to stick together.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpLmNvbS9nb2xmL25ld3MvMjAyMS0zbS1vcGVuLWZpbmFsLXB1cnNlLXByaXplLW1vbmV5LXBheW91dHMtZnJvbS10cGMtdHdpbi1jaXRpZXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2021 3M Open: Final Purse Prize Money Payouts From TPC Twin Cities,"Cameron Champ shot a final-round 66 at the 3M Open to clip Louis Oosthuizen Charl Schwartzel and Jhonny Vegas by two shots and claim a $1.188 million payday.

He held off a trio of Louis Oosthuizen Charl Schwartzel and Jhonattan Vegas all of whom finished two strokes behind Champ's 15-under number.

It was not straightforward. Champ went to the final hole needing just a bogey for the win and he hooked his drive on the par-5 into a spot on the course that definitely brought double into play. Two shots later he had 127 yards into the pin on No. 18 not a distance he's been all that adept at so far this season (189th on the PGA Tour in proximity from that distance). He stood it up to 3 feet.

Champ was nearly flawless on the weekend at TPC Twin Cities. A single double on Saturday was offset by 11 birdies over the last two days. This is the part that does not make sense. Champ who is one of the five or 10 best drivers in the world finished 40th in driving this week. He is one of the five or 10 worst putters on the PGA Tour and he finished first in putting this week.

Statistically this does not add up. It's not the only way it doesn't add up either. This year Champ has missed far more cuts (9) than he has top 50s (5). He missed the cut at four of his previous six events leading into this one.

There are other ways he doesn't make sense too. If all you watched was ball flights and shot shapes off the tee you would think Champ was one of the greatest golfers of all time. He flushes the golf ball. But over the course of his career to date he's been a one-trick pony -- driver only with little else complementing his one elite skill.

Now for one final twist here it's kind of worked! Champ has now won three times on the PGA Tour in his first 74 starts as a professional -- more than Tony Finau Tommy Fleetwood and Louis Oosthuizen combined. If winning is the goal then Champ is meeting it despite his extreme inconsistency (he only makes the cut a little over half the time he plays).

Where he goes from here will be fascinating. The pedigree is good so far and it will be intriguing to see what happens when like this week at the 3M Open he has extraordinary putting weeks. Or if his iron play jumps up a level or two.

Cameron Champ sometimes does not make very much sense and his win this week at TPC Twin Cities is emblematic of that. Winning is a skill though and when Champ has gotten near a lead like he did on Sunday he's converted more often than most golfers. That's a meaningful metric that is quite unusual and it shows that this three-time winner has become an aptronym which is a good thing to be when your last name is Champ. Grade: A+

Rick Gehman is joined by Kyle Porter Greg DuCharme and Mark Immelman to break down and react to Cameron Champ's victory at the 3M Open. Follow & listen to The First Cut on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.

Here are the rest of our grades for the 2021 3M Open.

Louis Oothuizen (T2): Oosty backed up his T3 at the Open Championship last week at Royal St. George's with another great finish this week. However that second win -- either at a major or non-major -- still eludes him. Oosthuizen nearly dunked his approach on the final hole for eagle but he still has yet to win in the last 10 years on the PGA Tour.

""I was happy to play this week"" said Oosthuizen. ""I sort of didn't really want to just think about last week about not playing great on that Sunday and immediately quickly go back into tournament mode and then play this tournament. So great track. We had a good time here this week and I'm just trying to see if I can go one better than all these seconds and thirds."" Grade: A

Patrick Reed (T34): Reed played fine this week but his weekend was upended by news that he's going to the 2020 Tokyo Olympics next week to replace Bryson DeChambeau who had to withdraw because of a positive COVID-19 test result. Reed has a wild schedule over the next few days where he has to get tested three times 24 hours apart before flying from Houston to San Francisco to Tokyo. He'll arrive the afternoon before the competition.

""Anytime I can represent my country and go play for my country I'm going to do it no matter what no matter where it is no matter what time zone or how I have to get there or anything"" said Reed. ""When they gave me the name Captain America the fans did it feels like an obligation and a duty of mine to go out and play for our country whenever I can and whenever I get the call. To be able to call myself not just an Olympian but a two-time Olympian is pretty sweet. I look forward to going over there and playing."" Grade: B

Rickie Fowler (T34): After playing his first 48 holes in 11 under Fowler played his last 24 in 5 over including 4 over along on the par-5 18th. I'm not sure how much progress was made this week but the good news here is that he rolled it beautifully. That's something he struggled with at the end of 2020 and beginning of 2021 but he's mostly righted the ship over the last few months which is good considering that from 2015-19 he was basically a top-10 putter in the world. It's going to be interesting to see how Fowler sets up the rest of his schedule as he continues to sit on the FedEx Cup bubble. He doesn't have to worry about playing privileges next year because he has some exemptions he could use but it would be odd to not have him in the postseason after he's been a mainstay for the last decade. Grade: B+",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1wcm5ld3Mub3JnL3N0b3J5LzIwMjEvMDcvMjUvY2FtZXJvbi1jaGFtcC1mZW5kcy1vZmYtaGVhdC10by13aW4tM20tb3Blbi1pbi1ibGFpbmXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cameron Champ fends off heat to win 3M Open in Blaine,"Cameron Champ was struggling mightily through the first half of this year a frustrating series of performances that pointed him back to his state of mind more than any mechanical flaw.

Like many newlyweds the 26-year-old was distracted by the delicate balance of passionately pursuing his career while still trying to carve out a healthy personal life at home. He found himself becoming much too upset by a bad round.

There sure wasn't much for Champ to be mad about at the 3M Open.

Champ fended off dehydration and crisply putted his way to a 5-under 66 on Sunday winning by two strokes for his third career victory.

“I just took a complete 180 in how I’m waking up every morning and how I’m reacting to certain things and adjusting to certain things” said Champ who had five birdies in a bogey-free round to finish at 15-under 269 at TPC Twin Cities.

Louis Oosthuizen Jhonattan Vegas and Charl Schwartzel tied for second. Keith Mitchell was fifth at 12 under and behind him were five players tied for sixth.

Champ joined Collin Morikawa Jon Rahm and Bryson DeChambeau as the only under-28 players to win in each of the last three seasons on tour. He jumped from 142nd to 49th in the FedEx Cup standings with the top 125 qualifying for the playoff opener.

This month has brought quite the turnaround for the Texas A&M product after nine missed cuts and one withdrawal over his first 16 starts of 2021. The best finish in that stretch was a tie for 17th at the Zurich Classic of New Orleans.

Champ hit the reset button after missing the cut at the Rocket Mortgage Classic in Detroit three weeks ago though and emerged with a tie for 11th at the John Deere Classic in Illinois.

“After Detroit I just took a step back and said ‘You know what? This is enough. I can’t keep going on this way. I’m not enjoying the game’” Champ said.

His wife Jessica was surely happy to hear that.

“It’s more so realizing what I want to do in the game of golf and then who I want to be at home. It’s a balance you have to find and if you don’t it can really haunt you and it can cause a lot of issues"" Champ said. “So I just feel like the last two months I’ve been in a lot better head space.”

During another 90-degree day Champ was far from his physical best. He felt some dizziness along the back nine putting his hands on his knees at one point as he hung his head to try to regain some composure. He had plenty of it on the last hole after his safe strategy with the tee shot to stay away from the lake landed way left in a trampled sandy area directly behind a clump of trees.

Champ managed to chip out onto the primary rough then scoot up the fairway. His approach was a beauty that landed perfectly and rolled back toward the pin. He sank the easy par putt and had enough energy to pump his arms in celebration of his first top-10 finish since last October.

“The Gatorade definitely helped I think keep me going” said Champ who won the Sanderson Farms Championship in 2019 the year he turned pro and the Safeway Open in 2020.

He had the best putting performance of the 3M Open field with an average of 8.48 strokes gained.

Oosthuizen shot 66 too in a much stronger finish than the previous weekend at the British Open where his 54-hole lead turned into a tie for third after a fourth-round 71.

Playing six pairs ahead of Champ Oosthuizen birdied three of the last four holes to give himself an outside chance. His approach to the 18th green almost yielded an eagle on the PGA Tour’s hardest par-5 hole but the ball lipped out. Oosthuizen made a 2 1/2 foot putt for birdie instead and his fourth runner-up finish in seven starts. Schwartzel his fellow South African posted a 68 to match Vegas in the final round.

“We had a good time here this week and I’m just trying to see if I can go one better than all these seconds and thirds” Oosthuizen said.

Cameron Tringale a one-stroke leader after the third round took a triple bogey on the par-3 13th hole right after consecutive birdies had brought him back into contention. He shot 74 and finished six strokes behind Champ leaving PGA Championship winner Phil Mickelson as the only 54-hole leader or co-leader to win in the last 13 tour events.

Matthew Wolff (2019) and Michael Thompson (2020) the first two winners of the 3M Open each finished in a tie for 39th place at 5-under.

Newly minted Olympian Patrick Reed tied for 34th at 6 under before heading home to Texas to get ready for Tokyo. He found out Saturday he'd been added to the U.S. team after DeChambeau tested positive for COVID-19.

“Once I start an event"" Reed said ""I’m definitely going to finish the event.”"

July 25 (UPI) -- Ace pitcher Monica Abbott struck out 13 and third baseman Amanda Chidester provided a walk-off two-run single to lead Team USA past Australia on Sunday in extra innings and into softball's gold medal game at the 2020 Summer Games. Abbott allowed just three hits and one run over eight innings to lead Team USA to the 2-1 triumph at Yokohama Baseball Stadium in Yokohama Japan. Advertisement

Center fielder Haylie McCleney led off the bottom of the first with a triple but Team USA couldn't bring her in for an early edge.

Abbott and Australia pitcher Tarni Stepto kept the game scoreless through seven innings which forced the extra frame.

Catcher Belinda White started the eighth on second base for Australia as part of Olympics extra-innings rules. She moved over to third when outfielder Leigh Godfrey bunted off Abbott in the first at-bat of the inning. Abbott followed with back-to-back walks to third baseman Stacey Porter and first baseman Taylah Tsitsikronis to load the bases for Australia.

The Team USA star pitcher struck out right fielder Chelsea Forkin for the second out of the eighth but then walked the next batter to give Australia a 1-0 lead.

Team USA catcher Aubree Munro started the bottom of the eighth on second base but was replaced by pinch runner Ally Carda. McCleney hit a leadoff single for Team USA to start the rally. Left fielder Janie Reed followed with a sacrifice bunt which advanced Carda to third base and McCleney to second base.

Chidester then stepped into the box to face Stepto. The Team USA third baseman smacked the first pitch she saw through the infield between second and third base. The hit allowed Carda and McCleney to score and won the game for the Americans.

McCleney went 2-for-2 with a run scored for Team USA. Chidester went 1 for 4 with two RBIs. Stepto allowed five hits two runs and one earned run in 7 1/3 innings for Australia.

The win improved Team USA to 4-0 in the six-team round-robin tournament. Team USA battles Japan in its final first-round game at 9 p.m. EDT Sunday in Yokohama. The Americans also face Japan in the gold medal game at 7 a.m. EDT Tuesday in Yokohama regardless of Sunday's outcome.

June 25 was marked with relief for brands marketers and the advertising fraternity at large. It was the day Google announced the delay of its cookie-blocking privacy plan to 2023 and it prompted the question of what that will mean for marketers now. There are two impacts here. The first is that marketers will need to protect the consumers’ or users’ choices and privacy and the second is that the industry must find a way for good quality content and publisher portals to generate ad-based revenues. For now the rush to predict and get ready for whatever a post-Covid world will look like has been temporarily paused. The second major dynamic came from Apple’s iOS 14 consent-management updates. Some marketers would call this change of the IDFA (Identifier for Advertisers) opt-in a significant issue one that will change the addressable audience size considerably and inevitably reduce scale.

Amidst the dynamics of Google’s and Safari’s changes in addressable audiences available tracking and advertising reach a trend is emerging: putting value on experiences in advertising marketing and commerce. People experience brands in new ways.

The demand for new experiences has been accelerating for years. The concept of liquid expectations is not new either. However the seismic step-change in 2020 meant that marketers had to rethink how to keep pace. 81 per cent of consumers who have increased their digital usage during Covid-19 expect to keep up with these increased levels according to our Accenture Pulse Survey in July 2020.

85 per cent of chief marketing officers (CMOs) have seen increased openness from consumers to new digital offerings introduced during the pandemic; therefore it is important to deliver with agility and efficiency. There are undeniable trends and areas of opportunity arising due to changing consumer behaviour and their requirements for access and ease during these unprecedented times.

The Rise of Digital Commerce

The pandemic accelerated the shift to commerce for brands dealing with art groceries exercise equipment furniture and more. For example Artsy an online marketplace for buying and selling art increased its e-commerce sales by 150 per cent as people looked to do up their homes. Artsy’s CMO has said the strength of the digital platform is that it is a place where businesses and creators can engage with more than 2 million collectors globally. Similar initiatives are spreading here in the Middle East with the likes of Artezaar and Singulart.

The proliferation of commerce has drawn attention and even more focus to customer lifecycle management retention and product marketing services. Therefore there is an experimentation mindset of running A/B tests analysing channel pushes and engaged audience cohorts. These are important aspects of segmenting elite collectors experienced collectors novice collectors artists and platforms that interested buyers are engaging on.

The Rise of Social Commerce

Brands need to deal with the fact that shopping has become atomised into many micro-moments spread throughout the day and across devices. Social commerce a kind of e-commerce that’s initiated and sometimes transacted on a social platform exploded during the pandemic. Research firm Emarketer reported that 36 per cent of US adults had made a social commerce purchase in their lifetimes as of last summer compared with only 24 per cent before the pandemic. We expect to see commerce shift from being centred around a destination (whether that’s a store a website or an app) to amplifying the experiences with moments. Social media will be the prompt for many of these moments – it will be able to influence and propagate people’s intentions to buy and will likely become a catalyst for change. Grabbing customers’ attention and keeping their focus on the brand in those moments will become a challenge for organisations. Therefore more attention is paid to harnessing immersive experiences in shoppable formats and video-based immersive experiences with spontaneous shopping opportunities tied in. For example so many home-grown stores are only present through social commerce. Lots of skincare beauty fashion wellness and self-improvement content is available now through interactive social experiences that allow for dynamic pricing catalogues and 360-degree videos 3D and virtual reality content.

The rise of super apps

Companies we currently look to for inspiration – such as Gojek and Uber – are often ex-start-ups. However their stellar success didn’t happen overnight. It takes a long time to transform from start-up to unicorn. In large organisations it takes a long time for an idea with promise to gain traction at scale – plus in the end the result usually looks completely different from the original notion. Gojek launched its application in 2015 with only four services: GoRide GoSend GoShop and GoFood. Valued at $10bn today Gojek has transformed into a super app providing more than 20 services. In May 2021 Gojek and Tokopedia announced the completion of their merger and established a new holding company called GoTo.

Another great story is the well-known WeChat app which started as a messaging service. It has now transformed into a multi-category app with social gaming mobile payments digital wallet ride-hailing (through its acquisition of Didi) and an e-commerce marketplace that allows for the inclusion of third-party apps and merchants.

We are getting more disrupted in how we use these services and engage for efficiency and frictionless experiences. In the region we are seeing the transformation of Careem into a multi-use platform as well with a community and charity focus (where Careem rewards can be used as a contribution to charities).

The growth of performance or outcomes business

Every business is a performance business and performance marketing should play a more prominent role in building brands end-to-end from creative to communications to channels to measurement. The telco banking retail and healthcare spaces are steadily being disrupted by the need to evolve into non-telco non-primary-service providers and to become utilitarian marketplaces. The data monetisation of assets and formation of a combined value of audience insights and offers presents new avenues of partnerships use cases and commercial opportunities for data owners across categories. Companies that have systematically invested in technologies around digital adoption over time have seen an increase from 25 per cent to almost 50 per cent of their recruiting now happening through digital channels with at least 15-30 per cent reduction in the cost of acquisition. In moving into media and online channels to drive sales we typically find these benchmarks in always-on marketing advertising and commerce programmes in banking retail telcos and services businesses.

The demand for data for personalised experiences

Intelligent marketing is best described as precision-led messages at scale underpinned by smart models driven by artificial intelligence (AI) or machine learning (ML). With news of depreciation of cookies and the creation of North Star offerings the value of ecosystem alliances becomes powerful. Pivoting the narrative from data-led to data-driven experiences is paramount from CRM imagination hyperlocal offerings marketing campaigns created around increasing the share of wallet based on consumption behaviours and connecting to content experiences. For example L’Oréal’s acquisition of beauty tech company Modiface powered by augmented reality and artificial intelligence reshapes the beauty experience and offers personalised recommendations for individual skin types. Spotify has a brilliant personalised experience that allows users to create their own playlists essentially building an entire library on their account according to their tastes and choice which allows for accurate advertising messaging.

Consumers monetise their own data

The topic of data monetisation requires its own comprehensive chapter bringing in the impacts of Google’s cookie-sunset (yes there is the idea of FLOCs essentially cohorts that can be targeted based on interests). But the question at hand is customers’ data and privacy protection and whether brands have consented to use digital profiles for targeting purposes. This to my mind will give rise to a disrupted model in marketing one that allows individuals to collect their browsing data through a tool manage it have it anonymised aggregated with others and then sold. The end-user gets 80 per cent of the resulting revenue and the platform potentially takes 20 per cent. Now this is individual data monetisation in principle and the next frontier in customer-experience disruption.

With so much change it’s been a period to reassess and search out how best to connect brand purpose to create a relatable meaning and impact that today’s discerning consumers across the value chain look for first. Elie Khoury director of financial services at Accenture Interactive says: “A customer doesn’t want a mortgage; he wants a home.” Eureka.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Streaming Learning Center's Jan Ozer explores the dazzling new Speech-to-Text feature in Adobe Premiere Pro a powerful new tool that makes it remarkably quick and painless to create accurate transcriptions and burned-in or exported captions for your videos.

Page 1

I've been using Adobe Premiere Pro probably for over 20 years and I don't think there's ever been a feature I've been more excited about than the speech-to-text transcription function they've just introduced in the most recent upgrade. It's fast it's accurate it's free and it's incredibly easy to use.

In this tutorial I'll show you how to use it and how it's going to transform any video that can benefit from captioning--which is to say almost any video period. In the tutorial video above you can see Premiere Pro's captioning in action.

Let's start by taking a quick look at how efficient it is to create captions. I'm working with a lesson from my latest course on live streaming. It's about three minutes and 21 seconds long. In Premiere Pro I'll drag it into the timeline and click Captions--making sure that text already selected--and click Transcribe. I'm also going to select all the defaults.

The steps that are going to occur behind the scenes are as follows: Adobe is going to create the audio file upload that to the cloud and then transcribe in the cloud. We're going to get back a transcript to which we can make any corrections that are necessary. And then we're going to convert that transcript into individual captions that are presented in the Captions tab in the Source Monitor and in the timeline. The transcription process took under a minute and a half for three minutes and 21 seconds of video. So it was very very quick.

And if I wanted to at this point I could play the video in the Program Monitor and review the transcript for errors and make changes as I see them while the video is playing. (I can also make changes after I tell Premiere Pro to create the captions.).

After you've corrected the transcript you click Create Captions again and accept all the defaults. And now Premiere Pro takes the transcript and creates individual caption entries in the timeline. And as they say boom you're done. At this point you would click File > Export Media to export your fully captioned file with the captions burnt into the video or as an SCC sidecar file.

I don't know if you've ever done this process yourself but to manually caption a three-minute file like this would probably take a half hour or longer just to get the text transcribed and also to get these individual entries both created and aligned. It's very time consuming very frustrating. And this new feature just totally does away with that.

Below you can see the captioned 3-minute 21-second file. Note that these I've left these captions uncorrected in order to demonstrate Premiere Pro's first-try text-to-speech accuracy.

Now let's look at this feature in a little bit more detail with a different project. The other video I tested this feature on is an interview I performed over a GoToWebinar with Michelle Fore and Tim Siglin. This is an interesting use case because we know audio is degraded somewhat by Zoom and GoToWebinars. So we're going to check the accuracy given that degradation. And we're also going to explore options like moving captions under one or the other of the speakers.

To begin I'll create the sequence click Captions and set the In Point at 00:00:00 and set the Out Point at 05:00:00 five minutes in. We're going to create the captions for In to Out Point. Then I'll go to Text > Transcribe Sequence and then take a look at the different features available in the Create Transcript dialog.

If you've got all the audio clips with dialogue in a dialogue track you can select this. We don't have that here. If you've got all the dialogue and a single track you can select Audio Clips Tagged as Dialogue. Or you can just choose the mix as I did with this clip. You can also choose ""Transcribe In Point to Out Point only"" which is what we're doing with this example. You can also choode ""Merge output with an existing transcription"" if there is one. We don't have that here. Apparently you have to opt in to identify speakers in the transcription which is not available in Illinois for some strange reason. Once you select this once you'll never see it again so no big deal even in Illinois.

Now Adobe is going to create the audio file upload that to the cloud and then come back to us with a transcription. For this five-minute segment it took well under two minutes to get to our transcription which again appears in the Source Monitor. Again if I want to make any changes I can do that as I did before.

Next let's look at a couple of interesting export options. I can export the transcript which produces a transcript file that you can use to save all the details of the transcription to import into another Adobe Premiere Pro project. I'm not quite sure why you want to do that but you can. You can also export a Text file. Before you do that if you haven't edited the transcript at all you'll want to change the speaker names which by default are Speaker 1 Speaker 2 Speaker 3 etc. If I wanted to edit this I could I'm speaker number one Tim is speaker number two and Michelle is speaker number three. Now that appears in the Transcript tab but it doesn't appear if we export the transcript as Text.

If we export as Text Premiere Pro creates the uncorrected file you see (in part) in Figure 1 below. You'll see the transcription but not the identification of speakers. So I'm not really sure where the speaker info shows other than the transcript file that you can import back into Premiere Pro. So it didn't appear to show up in any captions or any of the exported files. Again I can play through the video file and correct the transcript as needed. Or I can do that after I create the captions.

Click the image to see it at full size

In the Create Captions dialog you can create from the transcript or create a blank track if you want to insert them manually. I'm not sure why you'd want to do that. In most cases you're just going to use the Subtitle Default preset. If you're exporting 608 or 708 you can choose them in the preset pull-down. But for burned-in captions Subtitle Default is what you want to use or SRT sidecars as well. You also have a pull-down with additional formatting options. You can also create a preset from your preferred settings and once that is created you can choose it from the Caption Preset pull-down and implement that in other transcription projects.

You can also set maximum length and characters for each line of captions. In this particular case 42 is a good length. I can stick it under speaker 1 or speaker 2 without any issue. But if you're putting captions in a smaller window--say if you've got three speakers in a Zoom conference-you may want to make that number smaller. I've done that type of work before where I needed it. You can also set minimum duration in seconds or set the gap between captions and choose between one- and two-lined. I've always gone with two lines. Once again Premiere Pro is going to create the captions create the little inserts and align them as necessary.

There are a couple of things you can do on the edit side. For example if we see that Tim is speaking at a given moment you can't see his name. If we wanted to move the caption horizontally over to his half of the screen we can do that very easily. If you want a multiple-select holding down the Shift key you can select multiple lines of text and do that as well. That's a nice convenience. If you want to go through the aggravation of placing all of the captions under the individual speakers--and I'm not quite sure that's necessary in a case like this--it is doable. In addition if you wanted to change the font to say Arial you can do that well and push that out to all of the captions if that's your preference. You can also apply that change in Track Style as mentioned earlier or create a new style save it and then choose that style the next time you create captions. All the options you'll see in the captions area are to export an SRT file.

If we export this as a Txt file again no identification with the captions no timecode. And the SRT of course is going to have the timecode. And then you can import this into YouTube and other services that require SRT captions. And once you've got everything squared away again if you want to change anything in the particular caption you can do it in the Captions tab in the Source Monitor and Premiere Pro will correct in both places at once.

When you're done click File > Export Media. And then as we saw the first time you can export either captions burnt into the video or you can create a sidecar file. Below you'll see this video with burned-in captions created in this test. Note that I've left these captions uncorrected in order to demonstrate Premiere Pro's first-try text-to-speech accuracy.

So that's the new Speech-to-Text function in Adobe Premiere Pro. Not only does Adobe do a great job converting the speech into an accurate transcription It also takes all the work from placing all these individual files and copying and pasting text into them. So it's a huge timesaver for anyone creating captions in their videos.

Researchers say that being unable to cope with living alone leads to stressors that can lead to a 2.7 times higher risk of cardiac arrest within five years.

Men who have never married are divorced or widowed are more likely to suffer from vital exhaustion the study shows. Conversely married men have the lowest risk due to having social support.

“Vital exhaustion refers to excessive fatigue feelings of demoralization and increased irritability” says study author Dr. Dmitriy Panov of the Institute of Cytology and Genetics in a statement. “It is thought to be a response to intractable problems in people’s lives particularly when they are unable to adapt to prolonged exposure to psychological stressors.”

Researchers studied 657 men aged 25 to 64 and found two-thirds of men had vital exhaustion 15 percent at a high level. Three-quarters of men with high blood pressure had vital exhaustion with high levels at 58 percent.

Compared to those without vital exhaustion men with moderate or high levels were 16 percent more likely to have a heart attack over 14 years of follow-up compared to those without after adjusting for social factors and age. In the adjusted analysis the risk of a heart attack linked with exhaustion was higher in never married divorced and widowed men compared to married men.

Middle-aged men were more affected than younger men. In fact the older a man is the worse his risk. Compared to 24- to 34-year-olds the risk of a heart attack connected with exhaustion was 3.8-fold higher in 45- to 54-year-olds and 5.9-fold higher in 55- to 64-year-olds.

“Living alone indicates less social support which we know from our prior studies is an independent risk factor for myocardial infarction and stroke. The relationship of exhaustion with threatening cardiovascular events should be taken into account when assessing risk” says Dr. Panov. “Efforts to improve well-being and reduce stress at home and at work can help reduce vital exhaustion. Involvement in community groups is one way to increase social support and become less vulnerable to stress. Together with a healthy lifestyle these measures should be beneficial for heart health.”

The research was presented at ESC Acute CardioVascular Care 2021 an online scientific congress of the European Society of Cardiology.

Regular mammograms are key to reducing the chances of dying from breast cancer doctors say. In fact a new study warns that women who skip just one breast scan before being diagnosed with cancer are “significantly” more likely to die.

General practitioners recommend breast cancer screenings every two years for women between the ages of 50-74. Mammograms help doctors catch cancers early when they are easier to treat and the chances of survival are high. However researchers say despite their well-stabilized effectiveness many women still take a rain check.

“Regular participation in all scheduled screens confers the greatest reduction in your risk of dying from breast cancer. The results add further evidence to support regular screening with mammography as a means for reducing breast cancer-related deaths” says lead author Stephen Duffy a professor of cancer screening at Queen Mary University of London in a statement.

Data was analyzed from nearly 550000 women in nine Swedish counties with access to breast screenings between 1992 and 2016. They were divided into two groups based on whether they attended two of the most recent mammography screenings before being diagnosed with breast cancer. Women who attended both sessions were labeled “serial participants” while those who missed them were categorized as “serial nonparticipants.”

Researchers found within 10 years of being diagnosed 50% fewer serial participants had died. Likewise women who attended only one of the two breast cancer screenings had 29% higher mortality than those who went to both.

“While we suspected that regular participation would confer a reduction greater than that with irregular participation I think it is fair to say that we were slightly surprised by the size of the effect. The findings support the hypothesis that regular attendance reduces the opportunity for the cancer to grow before it is detected” says Duffy.

To better understand the benefits of screenings the researchers are continuing to analyze the data. In particular they are focusing on interval cancers which arise between X-ray sessions.

“We are planning further prognostic research into the mechanism of this effect. For example we plan to investigate whether and to what extent regular attendance improves the prognosis of interval cancers as well as screen-detected cancers. Estimation of this by time since the last screen may have implications for policy on screening frequency” adds Duffy.

The findings are published in the journal Radiology.

JAVIER SORIANO/AFP via Getty Images

Key identifying markers associated with Russia are banned from the 2020 Tokyo Games because of the country's doping scandal. In other words the Russian national anthem won't be played if a Russian athlete medals in an event and the flag isn't welcome in any capacity.

But the Russian athletes who are in Japan still found ways to make it clear they're competing for their home country even though they're considered neutral or at-large participants The Wall Street Journal reports. For starters while they can't don the flag (or images of bears) the athletes are still wearing a common uniform kit that features red white and blue in an obvious nod to the Russian tricolor. The International Olympic Committee's decision to allow the uniforms has received criticism from the World Anti-Doping Agency who were hoping for a more stringent ban.

But beyond clothing there's a big push on social media from famous Russian influencers and athletes — including several Soviet-era ice hockey legends — to stay engaged with the Games and support the athletes. And per the Journal the Russian Olympic Committee has instructed its athletes to openly say they represent Russia. Read more at The Wall Street Journal.

""It came a lot sooner than I expected so I was really surprised"" Dizon recalls of the romantic proposal.

At Friday's ceremony Boatman and Dizon made a point to also include their pets with one of their dogs serving as the ring bearer and the other as a flower girl.

""It's kind of a whole little bit"" Boatman explains. ""The pastor is going to go to my brother who's my best man for the rings. And then my brother's going to say 'Oh no. I don't have the rings. I don't know where the rings are.' And then the pastor's going to go 'Does anybody have the rings?'""

He continues ""And then this AC/DC song is going to come on and the suspense will build for a few seconds and then these sliding barn doors will open and Willie our dog is going to run down the aisle to me with the rings and then we'll leash him up and he'll sit there with us for the rest of the ceremony.""

As for what they're looking forward to now that they have tied the knot the newlyweds say they can't wait to simply experience life together.

""I'm just so excited to be like 'This is my husband'"" Dizon says. ""My husband! The thing I've looked forward to my whole life is one day getting married and then eventually later down the line start a family. Literally anything in life that comes after getting married I'm just excited to do with him.""

""These last five years with Julana have honestly been the best years that I've had so far"" adds Boatman. ""I love spending every day with her and I'm just looking forward to spending the rest of my days with her. Just doing life with Julana is what I'm looking forward to.""

Numerous individuals have spoken up about the Brooklyn rapper’s untimely murder but noted West Coast manager Wack 100 says Pop’s death could have been prevented.

During a recent visit to the No Jumper Podcast Wack informed host Adam22 and company how certain unwritten rules for up and coming artists need to be met when visiting the West Coast and avoiding all private residences in the process.

“Go check into that W Hollywood” Wack 100 said. “Stay away from them Airbnbs on this West Coast until you get your weight up ’til you get your politics right. Go to one of them hotels bro and be safe about it.”

When asked about Pop’s murder Wack disclosed how a fateful conversation days before could have altered everything.

“I told him four days before to get that man out of there and send him to the W” Wack said. “I was in Europe and Avery or Monte Lipman (of Republic Records) had called through Birdman and they were kinda asking me stuff. I told him ‘Get him out of there and send him to the W Hotel.’ I started getting calls from my people that the homegirls was up there and this and that. I’d just advise when y’all on your way up take small steps.”

Ultimately Wack 100’s warning wasn’t heeded. In February 2020 four individuals broke into the Airbnb Pop was renting in Los Angeles. After a struggle one of the robbers a 15-year-old shot the rapper three times. Pop later succumbed to his injuries. The four individuals connected to the botched robbery and murder were all charged. One suspect Corey Walker recently discovered he would not face the death penalty for his alleged actions.

But a combination of record heatwaves and lockdown has led to a surge of interest in listings on Swimply an app described as the ""Airbnb for pools"" in even the most unlikely parts of the US.

""I didn't know Portland had such a pent-up demand to do the swimming pool thing"" Jim Battan an IT consultant told the Sunday Telegraph.

He has had 900 bookings - comprising 2700 users in all - since last September making him over $100000 (£73000).

""I thought we'd just get a few bookings on weekends. A lot of the time it's small families with young kids. People have been cooped up at home [during the pandemic] and public pools have been closed."""

The price is striking because Intercontinental Real Estate paid around $72 million for the building five years ago part of the $304 million that it cost to snatch up Two Canal Park and Ten Canal Park at the same time.

The “life science developer” could be any number of companies familiar to Cambridge from Alexandria Real Estate Equities and BioMed Realty to King Street Properties which is putting up lab space in the Alewife area – or it could be someone else. Whoever it is hasn’t bought just a 30400-square-foot lot with office space; the ground-floor component of the 100000-square-foot four-story building includes the Tahaza Hummus Kitchen and a Blaze Pizza franchise as well as space where Haute Coffee used to be and is next to the massive CambridgeSide mall redevelopment which will eventually bring even more ground-floor amenities to the area. (After a no-doubt painful period of construction.)

In other development news:

A mixed-use project in Somerville called Edge Assembly Square was sold this month for $36 million to a South Carolina developer according to Bldup. What’s going up at 74 Middlesex Ave. is an 18-story building with just under 500000 square feet of office lab and research and development space along with 27000 square feet of retail uses and below-ground parking for as many as 350 vehicles. Who wants the cash more than this cash cow? The seller is Edward Doherty’s Kems Corp. a name worth remembering …

… Because Kems is also the seller this month of 44-unit apartment building under construction at 95 Fawcett St. in the Cambridge Highlands between Alewife and Fresh Pond. The Grossman Companies of Quincy picked up the building for $20.4 million in a transaction Bldup reported Tuesday.

Close by foundation work is wrapping up at 55 Wheeler St. which will bring 526 apartment residences across three buildings Bldup said Tuesday. The Redgate and Westbrook Partners project was controversial in 2019 because of the large number of trees that would be taken down to allow for construction – a theme forced on Cambridge as relentlessly as construction itself.

Back closer to One Canal Park there’s been a topping-off ceremony signaling the wrap-up of raw construction on a 468-unit building at 151 N. First St. in North Point’s Cambridge Crossing development. With the last beam in place construction on the so-called Park 151 building enters a new phase with the “residential landmark on the park” expected to be open to tenants in the fall of 2022. Bldup reported Thursday on the topping-off.

Since the return of fans back into the arenas WWE has tried their best to bring back as many big names as possible Goldberg and John Cena to name a few.

Current WWE champion Bobby Lashley issued an open challenge on RAW which was responded to by the returning Keith Lee who lost to Lashley. The champion was then confronted by a returning Goldberg screaming 'I'm next!' to his face. After how things went down at RAW it is safe to assume that Lashley will be defending his title against Goldberg possibly at Summerslam.

It will be interesting to see how the build-up to the match between the two behemoths takes place. Goldberg is currently being advertised for two episodes of Monday Night RAW in August.

The episodes air on the 2nd and 16th of August. The episodes will emanate from the Allstate Arena in Rosemont Illinois and AT&T Center in San Antonio Texas respectively. The two arenas took to Twitter to confirm Goldberg's presence at the events.

The latter is the last edition of RAW before SummerSlam so a confrontation between the champion and the challenger is inevitable.

Will Goldberg secure his first WWE Championship?

Goldberg is an icon in the pro-wrestling industry and has had one of the greatest streaks in history at 173-0 in WCW. He is a former world heavyweight champion in WWE and WCW and a former two-time Universal Champion but has never won the most prestigious prize in the business the WWE Championship.

His last attempt at the WWE Championship was at the Royal Rumble Pay-Per-View where he failed to beat Drew McIntyre for the title. He currently has a contract that sees him wrestle two matches per year.

Considering the backlash that WWE has received from its fans and the contract situation it is unlikely to see him winning the title anytime soon. While a contract for a few more matches can be agreed upon it's an unlikely outcome at the moment. Another possibility is also having him win to enable Big E to cash in and win the title.

Do you think Goldberg will beat Lashley for the WWE Championship? Will Big E cash in on the winner at SummerSlam? Let us know your thoughts in the comment section below.

Google co-founder and billionaire Sergey Brin 47 was spotted enjoying a lavish vacation at Lake Como in Italy with his wife and friends.

Brin and his wife Nicole Shanahan 35 were seen basking in the Italian sun as they took in the beauty of the popular European destination during a boat ride.

The Russian-American business magnate dove into the waters and swam across the lake as he was surrounded by friends and bodyguards.

This seemingly normal vacation is quite the contrast to that of Brin's fellow Google co-founder Larry Page 48 who has become a recluse over the past several years - avoiding being photographed except for a handful of times since 2019.

The two both stepped down from their top positions at Google's parent company Alphabet Inc. in 2019 but Brin and Page are currently still the eighth and sixth richest people in the world according to Forbes.

Brin has an estimated net worth of $112.1 billion with Page surpassing him at $115.9 billion.

In 2019 Brin publicly announced that he married patent lawyer and entrepreneur Nicole Shanahan in 2018 during a secret ceremony after three years of dating.

Shanahan who gave birth to the couple's first child last year shared the news with guests at a luncheon while announcing the start of a $6 million study at the Buck Institute for Research she and her husband's family fund are underwriting into the harmful health effects women experience after menopause.

Shanahan was a well-established Silicon Valley player before she met Brin having founded the patent management and valuation company ClearAccessIP in 2013. The following year she was also named a Code X fellow at The Stanford Center for Legal Informatics.

Shanahan was an Asian Studies major at the University of Puget Sound and after graduating attended law school at Santa Clara University

She also studied international trade at the National University of Singapore post-law school and attended the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies just before enrolling at SCU.

Unlike other Silicon Valley couples Brin and Shanahan have made no secret of their relationship choosing to go public with the news that they were dating by appearing on the red carpet of the 2016 Met Ball with Brin's ex Anne Wojcicki and her then-beau Alex Rodriguez.

The carbon-conscious love square even arrived together in the same car in a move that Vanity Fair later called 'head-spinningly civilized.'

Contrasting the civilized couple Page reportedly has been living off the grid for more than a year hiding out in Fiji on isolated islands away from tourists as the pandemic swept the world.

Fijian health officials even pressured a TV network to pull a story about him donating COVID-19 medical supplies to the country as the tech titan went out of his way to avoid the public.

He has spent months in Fiji during the coronavirus pandemic - mostly on the island of Tavarua - and it has been rumored the billionaire has bought at least one island in the country's Mamanuca archipelago sources told Insider.

Page also was spotted on a smaller island called Namotu which a sailor named Lorenzo Cipriani claimed Page bought in a blog post in August.

He had taken his private jet to donate COVID-19 medical supplies to Fiji last month as a second wave of the pandemic hit the country which was reported by Fijian Broadcasting Company News on June 19 according to Insider.

However that story has since disappeared from the state-owned news site - and sources told Insider that health officials in Fiji asked for it to come down claiming that the information should not have been made public.

A source confirmed to DailyMail.com that the article had been removed after health officials asked for the story to be taken down because 'they didn't want the donation highlighted.'

The article appears to have also since been scrubbed from Google.

DailyMail.com has reached out to Fijian Broadcasting Company News for more information and additional comment.

According to Insider the story had reported that Page flew from Hawaii to Fiji's Nadi International Airport to provide the country with medical supplies including masks gowns and gloves.

A photo of Page's jet was posted to Twitter on June 19 by a Fijian journalist who captioned the post: 'One of the Co-Founders of Google Larry Page donated cartons of COVID-19 supplies to Fiji as the country battles its second wave of the virus.'

The plane's call sign 813QS pictured on one of its engines is licensed to Blue City Holdings according to the Federal Communications Commission .

Blue City manages a fleet for Page and Brin as well as former Google CEO Eric Schmidt Insider reported.

Fiji's 'Blue Lane' initiative let the super wealthy visit the archipelago on their superyachts and private jets even when other travelers were banned.

'Super yachts are welcomed with open arms for which access procedures are easier while for sailing boats like ours it is not easy' Lorenzo Cipriani wrote in his blog post.

'The government are promoting a campaign welcoming those who have a lot of money to spend and are awaiting the arrival of hundreds of luxury yachts.'

Sources said that Page and his wife Lucinda Southworth who have two children have been seen surfing on traditional and electronic surfboards near the country's islands and that 'he's good at it too.'

Southworth is a research scientist and is the sister of actress Carrie Southworth.

The couple are very private and have not revealed the names of their two children who were born in 2009 and 2011.

In recent months Google and companies like Apple Facebook Twitter and Amazon have been hit with high-profile lawsuits and made to testify during congressional hearings.

Early this month dozens of U.S. state attorneys general filed a 144-page antitrust lawsuit in federal court against Alphabet Inc's Google court documents obtained by DailyMail.com show.

It claims Google violated the Sherman Act the federal law prohibiting monopolistic business practices.

The lawsuit reads: 'Google has employed anticompetitive tactics to diminish and disincentivize competition in Android app distribution.'

'Google has not only targeted potentially competing app stores but also has ensured that app developers themselves have no reasonable choice but to distribute their apps through the Google Play Store' it added.

Google requires that some apps use the company's payment tools and give Google as much as 30% of digital goods sales.

The lawsuit reads that: 'Google also requires all app developers that sell content through the Google Play Store to sell any digital in-app content through Google Play Billing.'

'Google now stringently enforces this tie by preventing apps distributed through the Google Play Store from using directing consumers to or even informing consumers about alternative payment processing options that may provide lower prices.'

As the new CEO of Alphabet Inc. Sundar Pichai appeared before Congress in May - though Insider noted that he and Page talk regularly.

Pichai testified on a wide range of issues including extremism such as those who rioted at the U.S. Capitol on January 6 misinformation cyberbullying climate change and the coronavirus the Washington Post reported.

Nell Minow vice chair of consulting firm ValueEdge Advisors called Page's relationship with the company he co-founded 'unusual' in comments to Insider.

'It's certainly unusual and it's certainly not good corporate governance' Minow said. 'You don't normally see someone who's still involved with the company hang a 'gone fishing' sign on the door and disappear.'",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9vbHltcGljcy1iZWFjaC12b2xsZXliYWxsLWJyYXppbC1kb3VibGUtMDUxNjU0MDA5Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Olympics-Beach Volleyball-Brazil double up over Argentina Swiss women on top,"Olympics-Beach Volleyball-Brazil double up over Argentina Swiss women on top

TOKYO (Reuters) - The Brazilian men's and women's teams got their Olympic beach volleyball campaigns off to strong starts on Saturday by winning their opening pool encounters against South American rivals Argentina in straight sets at Tokyo's Shiokaze Park.

Olympic debutant Alvaro Filho overcame nerves before teaming up with 2016 gold medallist Alison Cerutti to beat the Argentine duo of Nicolas Capogrosso and Julian Azaad 21-16 21-17.

While Cerutti who also won silver in 2012 scored the bulk of the attacking points he proved equally adept at the net with five points from blocks while Filho successfully dug the ball out five times.

""I'm still shaking. I was anxious before the match"" Filho said.

""The weather is also really hot and we had to stay focused all the time... But the adrenaline I feel now after the match is the same that I felt when my son was born. So it's very special and I'm enjoying it a lot.""

Rio silver medallist Agatha Bednarczuk and Eduarda Santos of Brazil dominated Ana Gallay and Fernanda Pereyra beating the Argentine pair 21-19 21-11 in Pool C.

It was a disappointing day for Germany's Laura Ludwig the Rio gold medallist who returned to the sport in 2019 following a maternity break as she and partner Margareta Kozuch lost their Pool F match to Switzerland after a good start.

Nina Betschart made all the difference for the Swiss with 14 successful digs in the match to keep the ball in play.

The second Swiss women's team of Anouk Verge-Depre and Joana Heidrich also triumphed over Germany's Julia Sude and Karla Borger despite a second set fightback winning 21-8 21-23 15-6.

Japan's women won the day's opener by default as their Czech opponents withdrew due to a COVID-19 infection.

In Pool A 2019 world champion Canadian duo Sarah Pavan and Melissa Humana-Paredes also earned a straight sets victory over the Netherlands' Katja Stam and Raisa Schoon.

The Russian Olympic Committee team of Ilya Leshukov and Konstantin Semenov overcame Spain 21-19 22-20 in Pool A.

The world's top-ranked pairing of Anders Mol and Christian Sorum began their quest to deliver Norway's first Olympic medal in the sport with a 21-18 18-21 15-13 victory over Australia's Christopher McHugh and Damien Schumann.

Dutchmen Alexander Brouwer and Robert Meeuwsen made short work of Americans Philip Dalhausser and Nicholas Lucena 21-17 21-18 while in the women's event China's Wang Fan and Xia Xinyi beat Canada's Heather Bansley and Brandie Wilkerson 18-21 21-15 15-11.

Over the course of 27 years Jeff Bezos made Amazon into a colossus whose power and influence reverberate across numerous industries.

The fortunes of Mr Bezos and Amazon have soared in recent years and after stepping down as chief executive earlier this month he plans to launch into space.

Mr Bezos’ passion for rockets and space exploration is but one aspect of his post-CEO life.

He is pursuing philanthropy spending lavishly on real estate and toys such as a yacht and embracing his role as a celebrity.

Starting tomorrow when Mr Bezos leaves the CEO role to become executive chairman the Amazon founder will enter a life that includes space exploration philanthropy and splashy spending on real estate and new toys.

As he hands over day-to-day management of the company to Amazon Web Services CEO Andy Jassy here’s a look at the personal and professional empires he created:

Long business tentacles

Amazon dominates online retail where it accounts for about 41 percent of all online sales according to research firm eMarketer. But the company helped pioneer cloud computing services and is a force in the advertising industry where it now competes with ad titans Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Facebook Inc.

In recent years Amazon has forged its way deeper into the daily lives of Americans through its streaming services and smart devices categories where it has maintained a grip even as competition has heated up. Its Alexa assistant and Fire TV streaming devices regularly rank among Amazon’s bestselling items on its site thanks in part to regular discounts.

Endless hiring

Few if any companies have ever come close to matching the hiring efforts Amazon undertook during the past year. The company added more than 500 000 employees world-wide in 2020 and could in coming years overtake Walmart Inc. as the nation’s largest employer.

Amazon has had several rounds of hiring sprees. In the spring of 2020 it hired 175 000 workers to meet a surge in demand caused by the pandemic later saying 125 000 of those workers could stay full-time with the company.

In September it added another 100 000 employees in the US and Canada. And this May it announced an addition of another 75 000 workers.

The company has boosted its corporate head count.

In January it announced the addition of about 3 000 employees to its corporate ranks in the Boston area one of a number of expansions of technology jobs in major American cities for the company. And in June it added 800 roles to its Amazon Web Services team in Redmond Wash. Amazon said roughly 130 000 of its 950 000 US employees work in its corporate offices.

Hollywood success

Amazon entered the filmmaking industry in 2010 through its launch of Amazon Studios. Now a recognised producer and distributor of movies and television series the Studios division has experienced Oscar-winning success as it has rolled out exclusive titles and featured headline actors such as Michael B. Jordan. Amazon has invested more in the division in recent years.

Some of Amazon’s most-recognised titles include “The Marvelous Mrs Maisel” a series about a housewife in the 1950s becoming a comedian. The show has run for three seasons and become one of Amazon’s most recognised titles. It has won numerous awards — Golden Globes Emmys and Screen Actors Guild among others.

This year its 2020 movie “Sound of Metal” about a drummer who begins to lose his hearing notched two Oscar wins at the Academy Awards. The recognition added to previous Oscar-winning titles including 2016’s “Manchester by the Sea”.

Mr Bezos plans to launch into space on July 20 in a capsule built by his rocket company Blue Origin in what will be the program’s first human space flight. Aside from space he has been gradually moving to an expansive post-CEO life that includes a climate-focused philanthropy and an embrace of celebrity.

Mr Bezos tops richest people lists with a worth of roughly US$200 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

In February 2020 Mr Bezos announced he was pledging US$10 billion to fight climate change through his new Bezos Earth Fund initiative.

The first US$791 million in grants were revealed in November 2020.

Mr Bezos has built up a portfolio of homes across the country investing more than US$300 million. Aside from his Seattle-area estate Mr Bezos has bought homes in the Los Angeles Washington D.C. and New York areas.

He owns more than 300 000 acres in West Texas where he keeps a close eye on a nearby base for Blue Origin.

Aside from real estate Mr Bezos has sold US$1 billion of Amazon shares a year to fund Blue Origin. Years ago he gave at least US$42 million to finance a group the Long Now Foundation for a clock designed to last millennia being installed deep inside a mountain on his West Texas property.

Mr Bezos owns at least one Gulfstream G650ER jet which can typically have a range of 13 890km and can seat up to 19 people according to Bloomberg.

Google co-founder and billionaire Sergey Brin 47 was spotted enjoying a lavish vacation at Lake Como in Italy with his wife and friends.

Brin and his wife Nicole Shanahan 35 were seen basking in the Italian sun as they took in the beauty of the popular European destination during a boat ride.

The Russian-American business magnate dove into the waters and swam across the lake as he was surrounded by friends and bodyguards.

This seemingly normal vacation is quite the contrast to that of Brin's fellow Google co-founder Larry Page 48 who has become a recluse over the past several years - avoiding being photographed except for a handful of times since 2019.

The two both stepped down from their top positions at Google's parent company Alphabet Inc. in 2019 but Brin and Page are currently still the eighth and sixth richest people in the world according to Forbes.

Brin has an estimated net worth of $112.1 billion with Page surpassing him at $115.9 billion.

In 2019 Brin publicly announced that he married patent lawyer and entrepreneur Nicole Shanahan in 2018 during a secret ceremony after three years of dating.

Shanahan who gave birth to the couple's first child last year shared the news with guests at a luncheon while announcing the start of a $6 million study at the Buck Institute for Research she and her husband's family fund are underwriting into the harmful health effects women experience after menopause.

Shanahan was a well-established Silicon Valley player before she met Brin having founded the patent management and valuation company ClearAccessIP in 2013. The following year she was also named a Code X fellow at The Stanford Center for Legal Informatics.

Shanahan was an Asian Studies major at the University of Puget Sound and after graduating attended law school at Santa Clara University

She also studied international trade at the National University of Singapore post-law school and attended the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies just before enrolling at SCU.

Unlike other Silicon Valley couples Brin and Shanahan have made no secret of their relationship choosing to go public with the news that they were dating by appearing on the red carpet of the 2016 Met Ball with Brin's ex Anne Wojcicki and her then-beau Alex Rodriguez.

The carbon-conscious love square even arrived together in the same car in a move that Vanity Fair later called 'head-spinningly civilized.'

Contrasting the civilized couple Page reportedly has been living off the grid for more than a year hiding out in Fiji on isolated islands away from tourists as the pandemic swept the world.

Fijian health officials even pressured a TV network to pull a story about him donating COVID-19 medical supplies to the country as the tech titan went out of his way to avoid the public.

He has spent months in Fiji during the coronavirus pandemic - mostly on the island of Tavarua - and it has been rumored the billionaire has bought at least one island in the country's Mamanuca archipelago sources told Insider.

Page also was spotted on a smaller island called Namotu which a sailor named Lorenzo Cipriani claimed Page bought in a blog post in August.

He had taken his private jet to donate COVID-19 medical supplies to Fiji last month as a second wave of the pandemic hit the country which was reported by Fijian Broadcasting Company News on June 19 according to Insider.

However that story has since disappeared from the state-owned news site - and sources told Insider that health officials in Fiji asked for it to come down claiming that the information should not have been made public.

A source confirmed to DailyMail.com that the article had been removed after health officials asked for the story to be taken down because 'they didn't want the donation highlighted.'

The article appears to have also since been scrubbed from Google.

DailyMail.com has reached out to Fijian Broadcasting Company News for more information and additional comment.

According to Insider the story had reported that Page flew from Hawaii to Fiji's Nadi International Airport to provide the country with medical supplies including masks gowns and gloves.

A photo of Page's jet was posted to Twitter on June 19 by a Fijian journalist who captioned the post: 'One of the Co-Founders of Google Larry Page donated cartons of COVID-19 supplies to Fiji as the country battles its second wave of the virus.'

The plane's call sign 813QS pictured on one of its engines is licensed to Blue City Holdings according to the Federal Communications Commission .

Blue City manages a fleet for Page and Brin as well as former Google CEO Eric Schmidt Insider reported.

Fiji's 'Blue Lane' initiative let the super wealthy visit the archipelago on their superyachts and private jets even when other travelers were banned.

'Super yachts are welcomed with open arms for which access procedures are easier while for sailing boats like ours it is not easy' Lorenzo Cipriani wrote in his blog post.

'The government are promoting a campaign welcoming those who have a lot of money to spend and are awaiting the arrival of hundreds of luxury yachts.'

Sources said that Page and his wife Lucinda Southworth who have two children have been seen surfing on traditional and electronic surfboards near the country's islands and that 'he's good at it too.'

Southworth is a research scientist and is the sister of actress Carrie Southworth.

The couple are very private and have not revealed the names of their two children who were born in 2009 and 2011.

In recent months Google and companies like Apple Facebook Twitter and Amazon have been hit with high-profile lawsuits and made to testify during congressional hearings.

Early this month dozens of U.S. state attorneys general filed a 144-page antitrust lawsuit in federal court against Alphabet Inc's Google court documents obtained by DailyMail.com show.

It claims Google violated the Sherman Act the federal law prohibiting monopolistic business practices.

The lawsuit reads: 'Google has employed anticompetitive tactics to diminish and disincentivize competition in Android app distribution.'

'Google has not only targeted potentially competing app stores but also has ensured that app developers themselves have no reasonable choice but to distribute their apps through the Google Play Store' it added.

Google requires that some apps use the company's payment tools and give Google as much as 30% of digital goods sales.

The lawsuit reads that: 'Google also requires all app developers that sell content through the Google Play Store to sell any digital in-app content through Google Play Billing.'

'Google now stringently enforces this tie by preventing apps distributed through the Google Play Store from using directing consumers to or even informing consumers about alternative payment processing options that may provide lower prices.'

As the new CEO of Alphabet Inc. Sundar Pichai appeared before Congress in May - though Insider noted that he and Page talk regularly.

Pichai testified on a wide range of issues including extremism such as those who rioted at the U.S. Capitol on January 6 misinformation cyberbullying climate change and the coronavirus the Washington Post reported.

Nell Minow vice chair of consulting firm ValueEdge Advisors called Page's relationship with the company he co-founded 'unusual' in comments to Insider.

'It's certainly unusual and it's certainly not good corporate governance' Minow said. 'You don't normally see someone who's still involved with the company hang a 'gone fishing' sign on the door and disappear.'",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9vbHltcGljcy1iZWFjaC12b2xsZXliYWxsLWJyYXppbC1kb3VibGUtMDUxNjU0MDA5Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Olympics-Beach Volleyball-Brazil double up over Argentina Swiss women on top,"Olympics-Beach Volleyball-Brazil double up over Argentina Swiss women on top

TOKYO (Reuters) - The Brazilian men's and women's teams got their Olympic beach volleyball campaigns off to strong starts on Saturday by winning their opening pool encounters against South American rivals Argentina in straight sets at Tokyo's Shiokaze Park.

Olympic debutant Alvaro Filho overcame nerves before teaming up with 2016 gold medallist Alison Cerutti to beat the Argentine duo of Nicolas Capogrosso and Julian Azaad 21-16 21-17.

While Cerutti who also won silver in 2012 scored the bulk of the attacking points he proved equally adept at the net with five points from blocks while Filho successfully dug the ball out five times.

""I'm still shaking. I was anxious before the match"" Filho said.

""The weather is also really hot and we had to stay focused all the time... But the adrenaline I feel now after the match is the same that I felt when my son was born. So it's very special and I'm enjoying it a lot.""

Rio silver medallist Agatha Bednarczuk and Eduarda Santos of Brazil dominated Ana Gallay and Fernanda Pereyra beating the Argentine pair 21-19 21-11 in Pool C.

It was a disappointing day for Germany's Laura Ludwig the Rio gold medallist who returned to the sport in 2019 following a maternity break as she and partner Margareta Kozuch lost their Pool F match to Switzerland after a good start.

Nina Betschart made all the difference for the Swiss with 14 successful digs in the match to keep the ball in play.

The second Swiss women's team of Anouk Verge-Depre and Joana Heidrich also triumphed over Germany's Julia Sude and Karla Borger despite a second set fightback winning 21-8 21-23 15-6.

Japan's women won the day's opener by default as their Czech opponents withdrew due to a COVID-19 infection.

In Pool A 2019 world champion Canadian duo Sarah Pavan and Melissa Humana-Paredes also earned a straight sets victory over the Netherlands' Katja Stam and Raisa Schoon.

The Russian Olympic Committee team of Ilya Leshukov and Konstantin Semenov overcame Spain 21-19 22-20 in Pool A.

The world's top-ranked pairing of Anders Mol and Christian Sorum began their quest to deliver Norway's first Olympic medal in the sport with a 21-18 18-21 15-13 victory over Australia's Christopher McHugh and Damien Schumann.

Dutchmen Alexander Brouwer and Robert Meeuwsen made short work of Americans Philip Dalhausser and Nicholas Lucena 21-17 21-18 while in the women's event China's Wang Fan and Xia Xinyi beat Canada's Heather Bansley and Brandie Wilkerson 18-21 21-15 15-11.

Over the course of 27 years Jeff Bezos made Amazon into a colossus whose power and influence reverberate across numerous industries.

The fortunes of Mr Bezos and Amazon have soared in recent years and after stepping down as chief executive earlier this month he plans to launch into space.

Mr Bezos’ passion for rockets and space exploration is but one aspect of his post-CEO life.

He is pursuing philanthropy spending lavishly on real estate and toys such as a yacht and embracing his role as a celebrity.

Starting tomorrow when Mr Bezos leaves the CEO role to become executive chairman the Amazon founder will enter a life that includes space exploration philanthropy and splashy spending on real estate and new toys.

As he hands over day-to-day management of the company to Amazon Web Services CEO Andy Jassy here’s a look at the personal and professional empires he created:

Long business tentacles

Amazon dominates online retail where it accounts for about 41 percent of all online sales according to research firm eMarketer. But the company helped pioneer cloud computing services and is a force in the advertising industry where it now competes with ad titans Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Facebook Inc.

In recent years Amazon has forged its way deeper into the daily lives of Americans through its streaming services and smart devices categories where it has maintained a grip even as competition has heated up. Its Alexa assistant and Fire TV streaming devices regularly rank among Amazon’s bestselling items on its site thanks in part to regular discounts.

Endless hiring

Few if any companies have ever come close to matching the hiring efforts Amazon undertook during the past year. The company added more than 500 000 employees world-wide in 2020 and could in coming years overtake Walmart Inc. as the nation’s largest employer.

Amazon has had several rounds of hiring sprees. In the spring of 2020 it hired 175 000 workers to meet a surge in demand caused by the pandemic later saying 125 000 of those workers could stay full-time with the company.

In September it added another 100 000 employees in the US and Canada. And this May it announced an addition of another 75 000 workers.

The company has boosted its corporate head count.

In January it announced the addition of about 3 000 employees to its corporate ranks in the Boston area one of a number of expansions of technology jobs in major American cities for the company. And in June it added 800 roles to its Amazon Web Services team in Redmond Wash. Amazon said roughly 130 000 of its 950 000 US employees work in its corporate offices.

Hollywood success

Amazon entered the filmmaking industry in 2010 through its launch of Amazon Studios. Now a recognised producer and distributor of movies and television series the Studios division has experienced Oscar-winning success as it has rolled out exclusive titles and featured headline actors such as Michael B. Jordan. Amazon has invested more in the division in recent years.

Some of Amazon’s most-recognised titles include “The Marvelous Mrs Maisel” a series about a housewife in the 1950s becoming a comedian. The show has run for three seasons and become one of Amazon’s most recognised titles. It has won numerous awards — Golden Globes Emmys and Screen Actors Guild among others.

This year its 2020 movie “Sound of Metal” about a drummer who begins to lose his hearing notched two Oscar wins at the Academy Awards. The recognition added to previous Oscar-winning titles including 2016’s “Manchester by the Sea”.

Mr Bezos plans to launch into space on July 20 in a capsule built by his rocket company Blue Origin in what will be the program’s first human space flight. Aside from space he has been gradually moving to an expansive post-CEO life that includes a climate-focused philanthropy and an embrace of celebrity.

Mr Bezos tops richest people lists with a worth of roughly US$200 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

In February 2020 Mr Bezos announced he was pledging US$10 billion to fight climate change through his new Bezos Earth Fund initiative.

The first US$791 million in grants were revealed in November 2020.

Mr Bezos has built up a portfolio of homes across the country investing more than US$300 million. Aside from his Seattle-area estate Mr Bezos has bought homes in the Los Angeles Washington D.C. and New York areas.

He owns more than 300 000 acres in West Texas where he keeps a close eye on a nearby base for Blue Origin.

Aside from real estate Mr Bezos has sold US$1 billion of Amazon shares a year to fund Blue Origin. Years ago he gave at least US$42 million to finance a group the Long Now Foundation for a clock designed to last millennia being installed deep inside a mountain on his West Texas property.

Mr Bezos owns at least one Gulfstream G650ER jet which can typically have a range of 13 890km and can seat up to 19 people according to Bloomberg.

Bloomberg

When Moira Gilchrist was first approached by Philip Morris International Inc. she wondered what a tobacco company wanted from a scientist who had previously worked on clinical trials for anti-cancer drugs.

The world’s largest cigarette maker was looking at ways of delivering nicotine in a product that reduced the harmful chemicals in smoking and needed her expertise in navigating the highly regulated pharmaceutical industry. Gilchrist a cigarette smoker at the time made the leap in 2006 becoming one of the first people from the pharma sector to join Big Tobacco viewed by many as the enemy of health.

“I thought if they can get this right this could be a solution for me personally but also for everyone else on the planet who like me light up cigarettes despite knowing the risks” Gilchrist said.

Fifteen years later Philip Morris whose brands include Marlboro and Chesterfield generates a quarter of its $28 billion in sales from smoke-free products and aims to boost that share to more than half by 2025. IQOS the device Gilchrist helped develop created an entirely new business line for the tobacco industry prompting rivals like British American Tobacco Plc and Imperial Brands Plc to scramble to keep up.

The smoke-free revolution is also one of necessity: Cigarette sales in the developed world have been declining and government regulation is getting tougher. The U.S. is considering a total ban on menthol cigarettes while Brookline a suburb of Boston is going to prohibit tobacco sales to anyone born this century.

With smoking trends going only one way Geneva-based Philip Morris which split off from Altria Group Inc. in the U.S a decade ago is looking elsewhere for revenue even at delivery systems for medicines.

In one of its boldest and most controversial moves yet the company said this month that it would buy British asthma drugmaker Vectura Group Plc a deal that would add fresh expertise in devices inhalation regulation and clinical manufacturing. Coupled with its recent purchase of Fertin Pharma A/S a maker of nicotine chewing gum and lozenges used for pain medication Philip Morris is arming itself to accelerate the development of new nicotine-free products.

But efforts to reinvent the cigarette haven’t weakened skepticism among antismoking groups that Philip Morris is truly aiming for a smoke-free future.

They argue the company and its rivals are keeping consumers hooked on nicotine with new alternative products that range from IQOS’s heated tobacco vaping and discreet pouches that can be nudged between gums and lips - and see the recent acquisitions as unsettling. For some there’s quite simply something wrong with a tobacco company owning a firm that makes drugs to treat respiratory illnesses.

Cancer Research UK said of the Vectura news that if Philip Morris really wanted to help “they could stop aggressively promoting and selling their products altogether.”

Vectura could also be damaged by the stigma of tobacco undermining its credibility in health care. The takeover could see it shunned at industry associations and barred from publishing papers or presenting data. The European Respiratory Society’s constitution and bylaws for example reject any links - even perceived links - to the tobacco industry.

While there are ethical concerns about the takeover the bigger threat to the deal may be a rival bid from Carlyle Group Inc. The private equity group previously agreed to buy Vectura until it was trumped by Philip Morris and it’s now considering its options raising the prospect of a takeover battle.

For Philip Morris Chief Executive Officer Jacek Olczak ownership concerns aren’t justified. While three-quarters of its revenue comes from combustibles the majority of its investment is now in smoke-free and so-called beyond-nicotine products he says.

“My reaction to ‘who is the owner?’ and that being what dictates opinion about something is that’s a path to nowhere” Olczak said in an interview with Bloomberg News. “Our aspiration is to solve the problem of smoking and it’s not a dream without substance to it - the technology for that exists.”

The Vectura and Fertin acquisitions hand the company major entry points for beyond-nicotine offerings. That includes expertise in oral and respiratory drug deliveries to speed up expansion in the wellness sector with products such as botanicals that boost energy or aid sleep as well as devices with potential medical use.

Vectura is also exploring inhalation as a way to treat non-respiratory diseases such as pulmonary vascular illnesses cancer and even covid-19.

Philip Morris Chairman Andre Calantzopolous cites the example of a heart attack sufferer who can chew on an aspirin to slow and shrink the size of a forming blood clot. But in a dire situation it may not start working fast enough.

“If you inhale it the bioavailability is a couple of minutes and that can save a lot of lives” Calantzopolous said. He added that PMI’s goal is not to discover new treatments but find ways to accelerate therapeutic delivery of existing ones as inhalation is the second-fastest way for molecules to get into the bloodstream aside from injection.

Along with product development comes the campaigning and lobbying areas where Big Tobacco has a troubled history that keeps alive suspicion about the industry.

Earlier this year Ruth Malone a professor at the University of California San Francisco and editor in chief of the Tobacco Control journal wrote an op-ed in the British Medical Journal criticizing the tobacco industry’s embrace of harm reduction as a way to weaken tobacco control and take over the narrative about their products.

Gilchrist challenged the view several times on Twitter asking the BMJ to publish her response which pointed out that the vast majority of smokers don’t quit but still want better alternatives to cigarettes. The journal rejected her rebuttal as public relations and Gilchrist eventually published her response on open science forum Qeios instead.

Given how hard some smokers find it to quit some authorities like Public Health England are taking a more relaxed stance on new products saying they can be a tool to help people. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized IQOS to be marketed as a modified risk tobacco product meaning switching can reduce a person’s exposure to harmful chemicals.

Much of Philip Morris’s future lies in The Cube its research center on the shores of Lake Neuchatel in Switzerland. In one room dozens of machines test heated-tobacco sticks to ensure they last for the promised 14 drags during a six-minute window. In another a chamber full of IQOS puffs is measured for particles and toxicity. Some tests are done on what’s called “lung on a chip” reconstructed lung tissue used for laboratory testing.

Hundreds of experts have been hired from the medical pharmaceutical life sciences and electronics sectors as well as communications to develop these new products and present naysayers with statistics and scientific evidence.

The ease with which Philip Morris hires such new employees today contrasts to when Gilchrist first joined. Back then hiring from pharma was harder because the company kept a lid on its smoke-free plans and people were more hesitant about joining an industry linked with disease and premature death.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9hdWd1c3RhY2hyb25pY2xlL25hbWUvamltLWJhbmljay1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0yMzAzNzI2MtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jim Banick Obituary (2021) - Stokesdale GA - The Augusta Chronicle,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/augustachronicle/name/jim-banick-obituary?id=23037262 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9hdWd1c3RhY2hyb25pY2xlL25hbWUvamltLWJhbmljay1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0yMzAzNzI2MtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50L2JkYjVlOTMwLTY5YzUtNDBlZS1iNzkwLWUxNDY4ZGYzZjg3NtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Philip Morris to stop selling Marlboro cigarettes in UK within 10 years,"Try unlimited access Only MX$100 for 4 weeks

So even if you’re building a tenant union or a political party this is a major social space. It has a broader importance.” This comes courtesy of organizer and geographer Spencer Cox quoted in the New York Times.

The author of the Times article labor reporter E. Tammy Kim follows Cox’s quote with a congruent assertion from socialist Seattle city councilor Kshama Sawant. “If you look at the consciousness of Amazon workers it’s a guide to where the working class is as a whole” says Sawant.

If class is a social relation and the working class is made and remade daily that formation is increasingly happening inside the massive structures that house Amazon’s warehouses where workers face capital embodied in the whir of machinery and barking managers and the beeps of the scanner in their hands prodding them to pick up the pace. It is happening in the parking lots outside where people smoke and linger and chat and dread. Whether Amazon is really the major space of socialization or merely a major one is less important than grasping the degree to which Amazon is operating as a near force of nature in working-class life.

The extreme geographic bifurcation of Amazon’s operations complicates the matter: some communities are vacuumed up almost completely by Amazon while in others people don’t know anyone who works for the company. Such unevenness is of further importance given that the warehouse worker is neither seen nor heard by the customer; at least at Walmart you go to a store and you see the workers — you know they exist.

Here’s how it plays out in many communities near one of the warehouses. Amazon’s application process is often perfunctory. You apply you get a job. Doing away with interviews or much conversation at all between potential employer and potential employee enables the company to beef up during “peak” which consists of the holiday season as well as the time around Prime Day the company’s holiday that exists to break up the summer lull. During these periods Amazon’s already immense workforce cannot keep up with surging demand so the company brings in armies of “seasonal associates” temporary workers who enlist for quick cash — $15 an hour Amazon’s starting wage is below the average for the warehousing industry but it’s still a hell of a lot more than our $7.25 federal minimum wage. Almost all of these temps are let go when the surge in sales recedes. This process has only intensified over the past year as Amazon buoyed by increased sales during the pandemic has gone on a hiring spree almost unprecedented in history adding nearly five hundred thousand people to its payroll in a matter of months.

The result is that whole communities are absorbed into the warehouse. For an example of what that looks take this reporting about JFK8 an Amazon warehouse on Staten Island New York that has been a particular site of ferment:

As dusk settled and trucks rolled by Tiara Mangroo a high school student just off her shift embraced her boyfriend. He worked for Amazon on Staten Island too as did her father uncle cousins and best friend. Keanu Bushell a college student worked days and his father nights sharing one car that made four daily trips between Brooklyn and JFK8. A mother and daughter organized containers of meals for their middle-of-the-night breaks; others packed Red Bull or Starbucks Frappuccinos in the clear theft-prevention bags that workers carried. Most said they were grateful just to be employed.

These are entire families employed by Amazon. Many of them will be let go within weeks though many others will quit even sooner unable to endure the stress and strain of the job. This churn is a concern for the higher-ups at the company who are increasingly busing people in from farther and farther away to maintain the staffing levels required during peak. As Paul Stroup who led Amazon corporate teams in analyzing the warehouses tells the New York Times“Six to seven people who apply equals one person showing up and actually doing work. . . . You need to have eight nine 10 million people apply each year.” As the newspaper notes that’s about 5 percent of the US workforce.

Look to the other coast and you find a similar dynamic playing out. Zoom in on certain locales and you get glimpses into one possible future: a company town in which a monopsony employer effectively becomes the governing structure for public goods and services. That this description increasingly applies to Seattle where Amazon has as much office space as the next forty largest employers combined has long been true. But the way this applies to areas near the company’s warehouses is less understood.

Take the Inland Empire a rural and exurban region in California saturated with warehouses because of its proximity to Los Angeles. At Cajon High School a public high school in San Bernardino students — many of whom have family members employed at Amazon — can take classes in the Amazon Logistics and Business Management Pathways career track.

Writer Erika Hayasaki visited Cajon High. Here’s what she found:

A dozen students sat clustered at work tables inside an air-conditioned classroom which was designed to emulate the inside of an Amazon facility. On one wall Amazon’s giant logo grinned across a yellow and green banner. The words “CUSTOMER OBSESSION” and “DELIVER RESULTS” were painted against a corporate-style yellow backdrop. On a whiteboard a teacher had written the words “Logistics Final Project” and the lesson of the day was on Amazon’s “14 Leadership Principles.” Each teenager wore a company golf shirt emblazoned with the Amazon logo. Students and staff members expressed pride in being associated with the company. Amazon partnered with the school as part of its five-year anniversary in the Inland Empire donating $50000 to start the pilot program the giant sweepstakes-style Amazon check displayed prominently at the classroom entrance. The students had already taken field trips to tour the nearby Amazon warehouse.

A public high-school classroom designed to resemble an Amazon facility with students wearing Amazon logos on their clothing as they memorize Amazon’s leadership principles (which it is worth noting also include “Ownership” and “Think Big” injunctions that hold merit for readers of this magazine when imagining how we might solve the problems exemplified by Amazon). Such a relationship between the company and public goods like a high school is part of what it means to consider Amazon as “the major working-class space of suburban and exurban socialization.”

The behemoth is here producing not only profit but people too. That entails corporate indoctrination social estrangement and profound alienation from one’s labor which is particularly meaningless as one breaks one’s body to get so many goods to people’s doors.

But were a culture of resistance and organization to emerge it could become something quite different: the warehouse as site of struggle and contestation and solidarity and Amazon as object of scrutiny an enemy. There are currently people both inside and outside the warehouses working toward the latter outcome and even the likes of Jeff Bezos can’t stop them. As a noted historian of a different era put it “The working class did not rise like the sun at an appointed time. It was present at its own making.” It still is and with each shift it is remade anew. Whether that will lead to despair militancy or something else entirely remains to be seen.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRheXRvbmRhaWx5bmV3cy5jb20vbG9jYWwvd2lsbWluZ3Rvbi1haXItcGFyay1iZWNvbWVzLWFuLWFtYXpvbi1haXItbGluY2hwaW4vTFQ3Uk9CQ0VHWkhXNUZCRE5VNDdIRlBGNE0v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wilmington becomes a key Amazon Air hub,"By 1 a.m. those planes and trucks have departed. In the nine hours between 1100 employees work in a choreographed production to unload thousands of packages sent from 50 states directing them to new destinations.

Last year cargo traffic at Wilmington grew 289% compared to 2019 according to a February 2021 analysis by DePaul University. Amazon is the reason why.

In Amazon’s goal of delivering many packages in one or two days the Clinton County air hub is the “linchpin” said Bret Kresak the hub’s general manager.

The Dayton Daily News was recently invited to visit the hub in what Amazon said was its first opening to the media.

Kresak said the beauty of Wilmington is its organization. This is where the spokes of a massive cargo-sorting hub meet with 1100 employees working across 1.1 million square feet of space — 550000 square feet on each of two levels.

The hub is a multi-modal facility. It moves items from airplane to airplane (”air-to-air”) airplane to truck (”air-to-ground”) and truck to airplane (”ground-to-air”) Kresak said.

“Right now we’re the only Amazon site that does that” he said. “The other Amazon sites across the country do ground-to-air and air-ground. So we’re unique in the fact that we do air-to-air.”

Amazon’s hub does not accommodate ground-to-ground delivery leaving that job to fulfillment centers like the one in Monroe or the one being built in Union.

Of cargo coming in 60% arrives on planes and 40% by truck. Going out 80% departs by air and 20% by truck with ground deliveries destined for homes and businesses within 300 miles of Wilmington.

Wilmington is one of two Buckeye State Amazon Air facilities the other being in Toledo. “This is our big operation” said Jessica Pawl an Amazon spokeswoman.

Amazon Air flight departures begin at 11 p.m. with the window between take-offs shrinking to a mere four minutes by 12:30 a.m.

“It’s a very high speed sortation operation” Kresak said. “It’s very synchronized and it’s very efficient.”

‘Reasons for optimism’

In 2020 439 million pounds of cargo moved through Wilmington Air Park a milestone that makes it the third largest cargo-focused airport in the nation according to a Supply Chain Dive web site report last month relying on an analysis of government transportation data by DePaul University.

Dan Evers executive director of the Clinton County Port Authority which owns the air park confirmed the cargo number.

“We were pleased to see that and we don’t dispute that analysis” Evers said.

One of the authors of the DePaul report Joseph Schwieterman a professor in DePaul’s School of Public Service recently visited Wilmington and came away impressed.

“There are plenty of reasons for optimism about Wilmington” Schwieterman said in an interview.

‘Back on the map’

Amazon’s Wilmington operations started in June 2019 following an 18-month pilot or test dubbed “Project Aerosmith.” Amazon was pleased with the outcome even though the company decided in 2017 to build its main $1.5 billion hub — which is not yet operational — at Cincinnati-Northern Kentucky International Airport.

“We were able to turn an opportunity into an operation together” Evers said.

According to the DePaul report the hubs at Cincinnati-Northern Kentucky International (known by its three-letter airport designation CVG) and Wilmington Air Park (ILN) “position Amazon to move assertively into third-party delivery at the time of its choosing.”

CVG and ILN position Amazon for a next-day shipping network that reaches 95% of the population of the contiguous United States the analysis said.

“Such a network would be valuable to both Amazon and third-party retailers selling on different platforms” said the report authored by Schwieterman Jacob Walls Borja González and Crystal Bell.

The air park has come far from 2008 when former owner DHL moved its international business to the CVG. The move resulted in the loss of some 8000 jobs in Wilmington.

“This operation has put ILN back on the map. And as we like to say there’s nothing as powerful as market recognition” Evers said.

When it becomes operational later this year the CVG Amazon hub will “dwarf” Wilmington in size DePaul acknowledges.

But Schwieterman does not think Wilmington workers have reason to worry.

“Wilmington and Cincinnati can have complementary roles” he said.

The reason for that confidence is simple: The air park is unique. The park serves general aviation and corporate traffic. It does not have scheduled passenger traffic.

“There are precious few cargo-only airports in the country that are flourishing and Wilmington is one of them” Schwieterman said.

Amazon likes airports with little or no passenger traffic. “They like no congestion” Schwieterman said.

For now at least a rising tide lifts all boats: Wilmington doesn’t have to out-compete Cincinnati he said.

Another reason for optimism: Amazon has invested in Wilmington’s Air Transport Services Group (ATSG) becoming a minority stakeholder in the aircraft leasing business. (Amazon also has a minority stake in ATSG rival Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings.)

Kevin Chambers JobsOhio managing director of logistics distribution and supply chain is a former Air Force officer and former partner at Deloitte Consulting in Dayton.

While Chambers cautions that while there are no guarantees he believes the ATSG investment “demonstrates their (Amazon’s) long-term commitment” to Wilmington.

“There is enough volume to go around” Kresak said. “Most facilities can continue to find their place. We’ll continue to grow along with CVG.”

Problem-solvers

It is “mind-boggingly complex” to make millions of different products available all over the country Schwieterman said.

Amazon’s Wilmington crew — they sometimes call themselves “Amazonians” — work hard to make it look easy.

Before Amazon’s Boeing 767s and 737s land (many of them leased from ATSG) employees conduct a “FOD walk” checking the plane’s parking area for debris. (”FOD” stands for foreign object debris.)

Arriving planes are greeted on both sides of the fuselage by crews ready to unload. Diesel-powered deck loaders rise to accept 24 large containers while at the plane’s lower belly smaller packages are unloaded.

Using hand signals employees direct drivers to pull their train of dollies forward. Once a dolly is loaded the train pulls forward to accept the next container.

Kresak observes that “no one is rushing.” Unloading proceeds in all weather conditions and moves briskly.

“It’s really amazing how everyone can work together in one motion” said recently promoted manager D.J. Henry. “They can unload a whole plane in 15 to 20 minutes. It’s pretty neat to watch it all.”

Inside the sorting hub large packages are trained or conveyed separately from envelopes or small packages. The operation is monitored by a “nerve center” where a small group of employees follow overall flow on six to 12 monitors.

If packages are damaged or missing labels they end up in a “problem-solving” area where employees rely on a proprietary Amazon software system to determine destinations and repackage.

“In my opinion this is the best area in the whole plant” said employee Kim Smith a former Airborne Maintenance & Engineering Services worker in Wilmington.

By the end of each night packages have been sorted placed into the trucks or planes for their next destinations and shipped out.

Since 2010 Amazon’s total Ohio investment has been some $5.9 billion creating more than 41000 jobs.

“We are just continuously overjoyed with the investment Amazon has made” Chambers said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ib3N0b25nbG9iZS5jb20vMjAyMS8wNy8yNC9idXNpbmVzcy9pbnN1bHQtaW5qdXJ5LXdvcmtpbmctYW4tYW1hem9uLXdhcmVob3VzZS1pcy1kYW5nZXJvdXMtaXRzLWFsc28tZmlyc3QtbWFueS1wcm9ibGVtcy1mYWNpbmctaW5qdXJlZC13b3JrZXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Working at an Amazon warehouse is a tough job. It’s the first of many problems facing injured workers,"Errol South twice injured his shoulder working in the same vast warehouse and is still struggling to get workers’ compensation to cover the cost of physical therapy. Tevin Silva was initially approved to receive physical therapy for his shoulder that he injured on the loading dock only to have the hospital cancel most of the sessions because Amazon failed to pay for them.

FALL RIVER — After a bed frame crashed into Dawn Fricker’s back at the Amazon warehouse in Fall River she fought for two years to get the company to pay her medical bills while out of work with debilitating pain. Only after appealing to the state workplace accidents board did she win a modest settlement.

These are three of a score of employees at the Fall River warehouse interviewed by the Globe who told of a brief moment at work — a falling bike a collapsing pallet of microwaves a mispackaged car battery — that caused a serious injury and set off a frustrating process of getting the company to provide pay while they heal and get the treatment needed to return to work. Some employees were unable to get workers’ compensation they believed was owed to them while others lost or gave up their jobs due to injury and were left without some health care benefits.

Four of the injured workers interviewed by the Globe including Fricker appealed their denial before a state judge who determined Amazon was liable for the injury and approved a settlement to the worker.

The Fall River warehouse has one of the highest rates of worker injuries in Amazon’s sprawling national network of distribution centers data show. It so stands out that for several years members of the Massachusetts congressional delegation have peppered Amazon with questions about its safety efforts in Fall River.

Many of these injured workers such as Kristin Provencal who was knocked over by the falling bike said the Amazon warehouse job was a good if grueling position that paid above minimum wage — unless you get hurt. For her that risk overrides the welcome pay.

“I tell everybody it’s just not worth it” Provencal said. “When we get hurt we are no good to them.”

The injured workers aim much of their frustration at Amazon as well as the firm it uses to handle such cases Sedgwick Claims Management Services. Silva injured his shoulder in May 2017 when a car battery slid unexpectedly in its packaging jolting his arm in its socket. He recalls that day at work as a frenzy with a shortage of staff triggering a pile-up of hundreds of packages on the loading dock. He worked through pain for three weeks before finally demanding to see a doctor who prescribed Silva physical therapy.

Sedgwick handling the claim for Amazon reviewed it and approved eight sessions of physical therapy. But after just one session with the physical therapist Silva said the hospital told him that he couldn’t schedule additional sessions until Sedgwick had paid. When he reached out to Amazon and Sedgwick he said he never heard back. A spokesperson for Sedgwick initially said it would review Silva’s delayed claim but later declined to comment.

Living on the $272.36 weekly incapacity payments and still locked out of his treatments Silva decided to return to Amazon with an authorization from his doctor to not lift anything heavier than 10 pounds. But because the Fall River facility specializes in oversized items Silva said he had to move boxes much heavier than 10 pounds.

“The floor managers didn’t seem to care about the limitations” Silva said adding he had no choice but to pack boxes with just his right arm despite repeatedly telling his managers he was still hurt. Months later still in pain Silva quit. He has yet to receive physical therapy for his shoulder which is still injured more than three years later.

Under state law companies such as Amazon are required to pay workers’ payments and cover the treatment costs for employees injured at work. Instead employees alleged that the trillion-dollar behemoth and the company it uses to handle the cases made accessing the payments and health care due to them under state law confusing and difficult leaving many languishing for weeks or months with only minimal benefits.

Workers’ compensation attorneys and experts say these problems afflict injured workers at many companies in Massachusetts not just Amazon and are especially common among large employers. The missed payments and long bureaucratic tussles that workers described “are just part of the pattern of denying injuries denying claims and making workers jump through enormous hoops” said Jodi Sugerman-Brozan executive director of the Massachusetts Coalition for Occupational Safety and Health.

Amazon spokesperson Rachael Lighty declined to comment on the specific injured workers’ cases. The company also declined to answer multiple questions about its relationship with Sedgwick.

Lighty told the Globe in an e-mail “Nothing is more important than the health and safety of our teams” and detailed investments in safety protocols for Amazon warehouses such as “guided wellness exercises” and “ergonomic tools and technology.”

Inside the warehouse — which is a third of a mile long and sprawls over 1.3 million square feet — items are stored on row after row of towering shelves. Throughout their 10-hour shifts as products are ordered workers ride semi-automated machines along the aisles putting items into a cage to be packaged labeled and loaded onto the outgoing trucks.

Amazon has 20 warehouses in Massachusetts and another 14 underway according to the Metropolitan Area Planning Council. Alone among them the Fall River warehouse specializes in heavy and bulky objects such as rugs mattresses bags of cat litter even basketball hoops that must be manually lifted from shelves before being forklifted to the floor and transported around the warehouse.

Warehouse jobs in general tend to be dangerous but Amazon’s warehouses have exceptionally high injury rates according to data from the Department of Labor and injury logs filed by the company. In 2018 the serious injury rate at the Fall River warehouse —11.8 per 100 workers — was more than three times the industry average according to data from Amazon’s injury logs that the Center for Investigative Reporting obtained.

In 2019 the rate of serious injuries the Fall River warehouse reported to OSHA was 17 percent higher than in 2018 even when accounting for the increased staffing a Globe analysis of Amazon injury logs found.

The situation at the Fall River facility fits a pattern of injuries increasing at Amazon warehouses around the country — a record that the Center for Investigative Reporting alleged in a September 2020 report “Amazon has gone to great lengths to conceal.”

Workplace specialists say Amazon’s intense focus on delivery speeds exerts extraordinary pressure on employees to move as many products as fast as possible — with the company using quotas to hold them accountable. That work tempo particularly when handling heavy items as in Fall River increases injury risk they said. The week before Silva injured his shoulder on the dock he said just he and one other worker were responsible for loading tens of thousands of boxes in a 10-hour shift.

“One of the major trends that is happening right now is e-commerce which introduces a different set of processes into a warehouse and increases the speed at which those processes have to be completed” said Beth Gutelius research director of the Center for Urban Economic Development and an expert on automation in warehouses. “Workers are pushed to their physical and psychological limits.”

For injured workers here’s how the system of compensation and care is supposed to work: If the employee misses more than five days on the job because of a workplace illness or injury the employer is required by law to notify the Department of Industrial Accidents or DIA within seven days to initiate the workers’ compensation process.

If a worker is unable to work at all for more than five days because of a workplace injury state law requires the employer to pay them 60 percent of the worker’s average weekly wage and cover the costs of medical treatment for the injury. (Workers who are able to work but for fewer hours or for a lower wage are entitled to up to 45 percent of their wage.)

Employers can pay these benefits for up to 180 days without admitting liability for the injury. They can also reject the claim immediately or suspend the payments at any time if they believe the claim is not justified.

Amazon often rejected claims citing a lack of medical evidence for the injury or disputed the injury was due to work at its warehouse according to DIA records obtained by the Globe. If the worker is still unable to return to work and still believes they qualify for workers’ compensation benefits they can file a claim for benefits which often requires hiring a workers’ compensation attorney.

This starts a process before the DIA and if necessary an administrative judge who can direct the employer’s insurer to pay the workers’ compensation benefits or rule it is not liable for the injury. (The department can also issue penalties for failing to commence or delaying payments as well as for fighting claims without reasonable grounds a DIA spokesperson said.)

When it opened in 2017 Amazon became one of Fall River’s largest employers and the recipient of a 15-year tax exemption valued at an estimated $100 million approved by the Fall River City Council in a meeting that lasted less than three minutes. In return Amazon guaranteed 500 jobs by 2019 a number it quickly exceeded and the demands of home delivery during the pandemic have swelled the ranks there even further. It currently has about 1200 full-time employees according to Amazon spokesperson Maria Boschetti.

As Amazon continues to expand in Massachusetts including building a warehouse in North Andover twice the size of the Fall River one (and receiving $27 million in tax subsidies to do so) a coalition of labor groups in the state is demanding better working conditions at the new warehouses. Amazon has fought attempts by its employees to unionize the Globe reported last fall. In the highest profile unionization effort to date workers at Amazon’s warehouse in Bessemer Ala. voted more than 2 to 1 against forming a union. (Union organizers are contesting the results and alleging Amazon illegally interfered with the election a charge that Amazon denies.)

The number of injuries in Fall River and at its other warehouses prompted Senators Elizabeth Warren and Edward Markey and then-Representative Joseph P. Kennedy to write to Amazon in 2019 and again in 2020 demanding answers about the warehouse’s high injury rate.

“Your misleading responses and public misrepresentations about Amazon’s safety record raise concerns about your commitment to the safety of Amazon workers and to creating a workplace that prioritizes and values worker safety” they wrote on Oct. 14 2020.

On Nov. 1 Brian Huseman vice president of public policy responded that at Amazon “we strongly refute claims that we have misled anyone about injury risks” at the Fall River fulfillment center.

The Globe obtained eight complaints filed by workers with OSHA against the Amazon Fall River warehouse since it opened none of which led to full investigations by the agency.

One employee whose name was redacted filed a complaint in November 2019 detailing safety concerns such as “boxes of merchandise are not stacked/ stored in a stable manner” among others.

OSHA sent an official notice of the complaint to the Fall River fulfillment center but noted “we have not determined whether the hazards as alleged exist at your workplace and we do not intend to conduct an inspection at this time.”

Instead as in the seven other complaints from Fall River workers OSHA allowed Amazon to investigate itself. “We request that you immediately investigate the alleged conditions and make any necessary corrections or modifications” OSHA said in its letter about the November 2019 complaint.

The site manager of the Fall River warehouse Sean Frost responded one week later stating that in each of the three allegations “facility management” had conducted an inspection and did not find any of the allegations to be true. OSHA didn’t pursue the matter –– or any of the other seven complaints according to the case files obtained by the Globe. Over the same time period OSHA conducted investigations of 3780 other workplaces in Massachusetts according to a spokesperson at the Department of Labor.

Asked why OSHA closed each of these files without investigating any of these complaints filed against Amazon the spokesperson wrote that “a case file remains open throughout the inspection process and is not closed until the agency is satisfied that abatement has occurred.”

While OSHA is tasked with overseeing workplace safety issues the state Department of Industrial Accidents oversees the administration of workers’ compensation and acts as a type of court system to resolve disputes. Amazon outsources the handling of these cases to Sedgwick which evaluates the requests for workers’ compensation and authorization of payment and treatment.

Some Amazon workers did navigate this process easily promptly receiving the temporary incapacity payments and eventually returning to work. But others described how Amazon through Sedgwick prevented or delayed them from getting the compensation and treatment they sought.

A Sedgwick spokesperson Judy Molnar declined to comment.

For any injured worker not just Amazon employees navigating the workers’ compensation process can be daunting lawyers familiar with the process told the Globe.

“It’s an incredibly complicated unique archaic complex system” said Audrey Richardson acting managing attorney of the employment law unit at Greater Boston Legal Services which represents many injured workers before the DIA. “Claims can be incredibly difficult and time-consuming to resolve if not insurmountable” she said.

Several Amazon workers said getting approval was relatively smooth but actually receiving the money was another matter. Four Fall River workers whose claims were approved said checks didn’t arrive for some weeks forcing them to wait on hold with Sedgwick to speak with a case manager or even return to work injured.

Other workers who received their lost wages found it difficult to get Amazon to cover medical treatments –– even after Sedgwick had issued a notice saying it would cover the cost of treatment.

Errol South of Fall River injured his shoulder twice while working at Amazon and is now unable to work due to his injury. He found the process to get workers’ compensation “tricky and confusing.” David L. Ryan/Globe Staff

Errol South was lifting a bed frame last September when he felt an acute pain in his shoulder. It was so severe that South drove himself to a nearby emergency room where he was diagnosed with a strain by the doctor he told the Globe. South has four children and couldn’t afford to be out of work for long. So he returned just over a week later with a doctor’s note stating his restrictions. Two months later in November 2019 South injured his shoulder again lifting another oversized box.

This time the pain was too much and South had to stop working. He made an appointment at a chiropractor’s office for his shoulder and he said Sedgwick paid for the appointment. But 10 sessions later South’s doctor informed him that workers’ compensation administered by Sedgwick had stopped paying after the first session — even though the claims adjuster acknowledged the injury had occurred at work. And South was still in too much pain to work.

He didn’t know what to do next. He found the process to get workers’ compensation “tricky and confusing.” Claims adjusters at Sedgwick were hard to get on the phone. “If you are trying to get into contact with them you can forget about it” South said.

South’s experience with Sedgwick is not unusual said Stacie Sobosik a workers’ compensation attorney who has represented many clients who faced difficulties obtaining compensation from Sedgwick. “It’s like reaching into a void” she said. “They are one of the more difficult third-party administrators in Massachusetts.”

South is now unemployed and cannot lift with his right arm. He has retained a personal injury lawyer to help him negotiate with Sedgwick to cover his medical bills.

Other injured workers said they too had to hire lawyers after their workers’ compensation benefits were terminated in order to bring a case to the Department of Industrial Accidents.

Four said they eventually ended up with a settlement from Amazon of lump sums of more than $20000. For each public records from the cases show Sedgwick terminated so-called temporary incapacity payments arguing there was “insufficient credible medical evidence to determine liability” among other reasons.

After bringing their cases to the DIA however records indicate Sedgwick and Amazon agreed to additional compensation. Sobosik the workers’ compensation attorney said it is common for companies to fight workers’ compensation claims only to give in or lose after a long-drawn out process.

“The fact that it was in litigation for two years doesn’t surprise me” Sobosik said “That’s completely par for the course.”

Fricker for example the packer who was hit by a falling bed frame in August 2017 had her incapacity payments discontinued in May 2017. Sedgwick said its medical examiner had determined Fricker could return to full time work “with some restrictions.”

But Fricker said the doctor paid by Amazon barely evaluated her before approving her return to work. Eventually after numerous conferences before administrative judges she received a settlement of $40000 in May 2019 — almost two years after her injury. Case records indicate the industrial accidents board found Amazon was liable for her injury.

But Fricker said the settlement is less of a victory than what it might seem. Today she remains largely incapacitated by her injury and continues to fight Amazon and Sedgwick over outstanding medical bills. The settlement money has long been used up so Fricker had to find a new job she could manage despite constant nerve pain; she started working at McDonald’s during the night shift when the pace is comparatively slow.

“It’s left me nowhere” Fricker said “I’m worse off than when I started.”

If you've grown weary of Alexa's hitherto feminine-sounding voice which up until now was the only choice you had Amazon also unveiled a new masculine-sounding voice which can -- but doesn't have to be -- paired with Ziggy or another wake word.

In other words the appearance of Ziggy concurrent with a masculine voice option should not be taken to imply that one belongs specifically with the other. Rather you're free to mix and match wake words with either of the voices and if you've got a bunch of Amazon Echos in your house that's at least one really good reason to do so.

However that still doesn't address the real question at the heart of Amazon's recent smart speaker update: Who is Ziggy? For me it's evocative of David Bowie's Ziggy Stardust persona -- an alien androgyne from the future sent to help Earth. Makes sense right?

Oh boy was I wrong. Ziggy as a couple of Twitter denizens pointed out to me is also the name of the computer on the TV show Quantum Leap. Interestingly while characters referred to Ziggy throughout the series using masculine pronouns when this fictional Ziggy was finally given a voice it was voiced by a woman.

If you like you can ask Alexa's gender and the voice assistant will explain ""As an AI I don't have a gender.""

Now before anyone tweets about the three celebrity voice options you can pay to put on your Amazon Echo device -- Samuel L. Jackson Melissa McCarthy and Shaquille O'Neal -- those add-ons don't replace everything Alexa says (the way the new voice option does) just select responses -- like weather timers and some goofy personality-specific questions.

Whether you think a masculine-sounding voice and the name Ziggy are a quantum leap forward in gender equity or you're just really into cha-cha-cha-changes here's how to swap voices and wake words on your Amazon Echo speaker or display.

Switch your Echo's wake word to Ziggy like this

The wake word is the name you say to activate Amazon's digital voice assistant; the default wake word is Alexa. The steps are the same regardless of which option you want to change it to. There's the easy way -- say ""Alexa [or whatever your current wake word is] change your wake word"" and then respond to one of the choices the voice assistant gives you. Then there's the slower way:

1. Open the Alexa app then tap Devices on the bottom menu bar tap Echo & Alexa at the top then tap the name of the device that you want to change the wake word for.

2. Tap the Settings (gear) icon in the upper right corner then scroll down and tap Wake Word then tap the one you'd like to use.

3. A popup will warn you it may take a few minutes to take effect -- tap OK.

Swap your Echo's voice (using any wake word) like this

Just like with the wake word there's a voice command to change Alexa's voice -- ""Alexa change your voice."" Your Echo device will confirm that it's using the new voice. If you change to the masculine-sounding voice you'll be told how to change the wake word as well. Or you can do it in Settings:

1. Repeat steps 1 and 2 from above but instead of Wake Word tap Alexa's Voice.

2. Choose between Original (feminine-sounding) and New (masculine-sounding) then simply back out of that setting.

There you have it -- you still don't have a lot of options (Google Assistant for example has several voices to choose from although only one wake word) but you've got more now than ever before.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDQzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3RlY2gvYW1hem9uLWtleS10by1zZWN1cml0eS1jYXV0aW9uLzUyMS01MjJjYmYxMi1hNmViLTRhMDUtOTJlMC1jZmY1YTU0ZWFjZjjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazon wants a 'Key' to your business and garage: why security experts urge caution,"An Amazon program allows delivery drivers to unlock buildings with a mobile device.

YORK Pa. — The Amazon Key program allows delivery drivers to unlock businesses apartment buildings and residential garages with a mobile device. But the program may stir security concerns amid the rise of cyber attacks.

The program first announced in 2018 includes Key for Garage and Key for Business. Both allow Amazon to install a lock or integrate some garage and home security apps to grant drivers access.

The company touts Key as a way to reduce package thefts also known as “porch piracy.”

Security measures include driver background checks one single time-bound access and confirmation of driver ID route location and time of request.

Security experts though are warning against a different kind of crime: cyber attacks.

“Anything can be hacked. It's just a matter of how sophisticated the hackers are and how much time they have to hack it before vulnerabilities are fixed” said John Sancenito president of York-based security consulting company INA.

The concern is that the the same solution to alleviate package theft could lead to more significant crimes like burglary if someone is able to get inside a house or business.

York City Police Lt. Daniel Lentz said the city does get some reports of stolen packages but porch piracy is more of a problem around the holidays when people order more big-ticket items. He said from a law enforcement perspective a program like Key could be useful but would also quickly raise the number of suspects if something is stolen in a Key-enabled building.

“Individuals have to monitor their own risk and have to make important decisions on risk versus reward” Sancenito said.

Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment on potential for hacking of the Key program.

Security experts suggest that those who do decide to use a digital unlocking platform have the lock installed on a vestibule or outside door.

With or without Key experts also suggest a doorway security camera to monitor who’s coming and going."

American adds two new Caribbean flights

American Airlines has been expanding its Miami hub significantly in recent months as the carrier faces increased competition from new entrants into the market including JetBlue Southwest and Spirit. The carrier has now announced two new Caribbean routes to Anguilla and Dominica.

As of December 11 2021 American will launch 2x weekly flights between Miami (MIA) and Anguilla (AXA). The 1221-mile flight will operate with the following schedule on Wednesdays and Saturdays:

AA3780 Miami to Anguilla departing 10:50AM arriving 2:49PM

AA3780 Anguilla to Miami departing 3:40PM arriving 5:53PM

As of December 8 2021 American will launch 2x weekly flights between Miami (MIA) and Dominica (DOM). The 1415-mile flight will operate with the following schedule on Wednesdays and Saturdays:

AA3579 Miami to Dominica departing 11:00AM arriving 3:21PM

AA3579 Dominica to Miami departing 4:24PM arriving 6:55PM American Airlines’ two new Caribbean routes

Both flights will be operated by American Eagle using Embraer E175 aircraft. These planes feature a total of 76 seats including 12 first class seats 20 extra legroom economy seats and 44 economy seats. Personally I find these jets to be extremely comfortable on par with mainline aircraft. I love the 1-2 layout in first class and the 2-2 layout in economy meaning there are no middle seats.

What makes these new Caribbean routes cool

While two new regional jet routes to the Caribbean might not sound too exciting both of these are potentially valuable additions. Why? Neither island otherwise has direct service from the United States mainland.

For example Anguilla is a popular destination for Americans and has plenty of great hotels ranging from Cap Juluca (Belmond) to Four Seasons to Malliouhana (Auberge) to Zemi Beach House (LXR). Up until now if you’ve wanted to get to Anguilla you’d need to connect through another Caribbean island. Four Seasons Anguilla

Dominica is an awesome eco-destination based on everything I’ve heard and I’d love to visit at some point. However up until now there has been no direct service to the mainland.

Kempinski Dominica

The schedules for both of these flights are well timed and are ideal for planning a three to four day trip to the Caribbean.

Bottom line

American Airlines will be launching twice weekly flights from Miami to both Anguilla and Dominica. These are great new routes given that both of these are destinations that don’t otherwise have service directly from the United States mainland.

It’s always nice to see destinations become more easily accessible and that’s exactly what these routes offer.

Oh and she wasn’t wearing a mask.

The incident occurred onboard an AA flight from Dallas to Orlando. While it isn’t clear what started the encounter a maskless woman is captured on video screaming at the passengers around her.

Among her statements:

“F***ing faggots! You corrupted Disney!” “You think I talk to my kids about same-sex marriage? No we don’t talk about that. But if y’all wanna talk about it let’s talk about it. About how lesbians…?”

Another passenger onboard spoke up:

“I’m in a lesbian marriage and I fought for this country. Please get off this plane.”

A flight attendant appeared and hauled her off the plane to applause onboard. Police were waiting on the jet bridge though it is not clear if the woman was detained.

The woman was later identified as Kelci Cashman a Texas realtor.

An American Airlines spokesperson did not go into detail providing a catch-all statement on poor passenger behavior:

“We expect our customers to comply with our policies when they choose to travel with us and we take action when that is not the case. Harassment of any kind will not be tolerated and we thank our team members for their professionalism.”

But with nearly 49% of the country fully vaccinated travel is making a big comeback — even with the fast-spreading delta variant.

If you're ready to travel The Points Guy (TPG) has released its annual report on the best U.S. airlines for 2021.

To determine the list the website ranked each airline in four categories using data from the Department of Transportation. Those factors include reliability (including timeliness cancellations and baggage); experience (cabin features lounges and customer complaints); cost (including bag and change fees) and loyalty (frequent flyer usage and award availability).

For the third straight year in a row TPG ranked Delta Air Lines No. 1 according to the report.

""The carrier wasn't a standout in any single category — it was fifth for mishandled baggage and fourth for customer complaints submitted to the DOT for example"" the report said. ""However Delta only hit the bottom spot in a single element (affordability) otherwise maintaining solid scores across the remaining data-backed criteria we analyzed. This consistency helped push it to the top spot.""

Here are the 10 best U.S. airlines according to TPG's report and their highest and lowest performing areas:

1. Delta Air Lines

Top-performing areas: involuntary bumps from flights lounges

Lowest-performing areas: affordability

2. Southwest Airlines

Top-performing areas: customer satisfaction bag/change fees award availability

Lowest-performing areas: lounges

(A Southwest spokesperson says it's honored to make the list during one of the toughest years in the airline's history and credits the Southwest employees for its success.)

3. United Airlines

Top-performing areas: route network frequent flyer

Lowest-performing areas: affordability

4. Alaska Airlines

Top-performing areas: lounges

Lowest-performing areas: bag/change fees

5. American Airlines

Top-performing areas: family route network

Lowest-performing areas: baggage

6. JetBlue Airways

Top-performing areas: cabin features award availability

Lowest-performing areas: bag change fees

7. Hawaiian Airlines

Top-performing areas: timeliness involuntary bumps

Lowest-performing areas: customer satisfaction route network

8. Spirit Airlines

Top-performing areas: cancellations affordability

Lowest-performing areas: wheelchairs scooters bag/change fees

(A spokesperson for Spirit says it's pleased to make the list and is ""looking forward to climbing higher in the years to come.""

9. Frontier

Guest columnist

Iowa has a tremendous opportunity to modernize our transportation by moving to pollution-free vehicles and investing in clean transportation infrastructure. We have already begun to invest in electric vehicles or EVs. The E-transit bus pilot program at the Des Moines Area Regional Transit Authority is a prime example of how we can use these technologies to help reduce carbon pollution and improve air quality.

Our state is a leader in electric generation from wind and has made a significant investment in this technology. Cleaner energy sources like wind solar and electric are the future. EVs are a natural next step to protect health save consumers money and drive economic growth and job creation in the coming decades. Already strong federal clean car standards are expected to bring over 7000 new jobs to our state by 2030 according to a Union of Concerned Scientists analysis. We now can move even further and cannot let this pass us by.

The transportation sector provides unlimited opportunities to create family-sustaining jobs and economic growth. Expanding the electric vehicle market could create 1 million good-paying manufacturing jobs that support families in the auto industry nationwide a researcher for climate policy think tank Energy Innovation wrote for Forbes. Investment in electric vehicle infrastructure including building out charging stations developing American-made batteries and updating the electric grid will create community-sustaining jobs in the construction sector.

The transportation sector is now the largest source of carbon pollution in the U.S. Investing in clean vehicles is one of the most effective ways we can fight climate change. As climate change makes extreme weather events more frequent and severe like the 32 our state experienced between 2010 and 2020 the cost of inaction will only grow. More than 70000 Iowans are particularly vulnerable to extreme heat and by 2050 the typical number of heat wave days in Iowa is projected to increase from around five to nearly 40 days a year. We need to correct course before it’s too late.

Another View:Iowa shouldn't be last in access to electric vehicles

Another View:Iowa auto laws put consumers first and are still friendly to electric vehicles

We need bold government and private sector investments in clean vehicles because every Iowan deserves clean air. Pollution from cars buses and trucks dirties our air threatens our health and can lead to increased respiratory disease like asthma suffered by 194000 adults and 42000 children in our state. Electric vehicles will fight air pollution and protect our health and families’ budgets. It is predicted that with EVs every household will save at least $3000 at the gas pump every year. Particularly during a public health and economic crisis we need our leaders to protect our health fight climate change and take steps to help consumers save money.

Low-wealth communities and communities of color bear the brunt of air pollution and the climate crisis. They often live in vulnerable homes and neighborhoods close to freeways and congested highways. They are exposed to higher concentrations of pollutants by industry near their homes. By investing in cleaner cars we can reduce harmful pollution and ensure all our communities in Iowa have cleaner air.

As a member of the Iowa House of Representatives it’s my job to advance policies to protect the health of my constituents and all Iowans. It’s vital that we develop good policies and that our authority to implement those policies is protected by our leaders in Washington.

President Joe Biden’s restoration of state authority under the Clean Air Act is pivotal for states pushing ahead with more ambitious clean vehicle initiatives and going even further than the federal government in reining in dirty vehicle pollution. For Iowa electric vehicles and infrastructure have the power to drive down pollution and spur the economy by increasing EV innovation at the state level while working with national efforts to electrify the transportation sector.

U.S. Rep. Cindy Axne has been a true leader on climate for all Iowans and we’re lucky to have her representation in Congress. Now it’s vital that she and all our congressional delegation support bold investments in the electric vehicle market to improve public health and create economic opportunity for all Iowans.

Donald J. Trump the nation's 45th president is unique among U.S. presidents in his connections to the business world. Certainly there have been presidents before him who were businessmen: both George H.W. Bush and his son George W. were in the oil business. Herbert Hoover was in mining and Warren G. Harding was in the newspaper business.

The difference is that every president before Trump had held one or more government positions before taking the office or had served as a general in the military.

This means that Trump's business record and the performance of his companies were the public's only basis for measuring his professional performance before he became president.

We know considerably more now although there is still much to know. Here's what we know and don't know about Trump's business dealings his successes and failures and his financial health as he left the presidency.

Key Takeaways Trump's businesses generated at least $446.3 million in sales in 2019. That dropped about 40% to $278 million in 2020.

The Trump National Doral golf resort generated the most revenue of any of the former president's businesses in 2019 posting $77.2 million in sales. Its revenue plunged more than 40% in 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic year.

Trump's net worth slipped to about $2.3 billion during his presidency compared to about $3 billion before he took office according to Bloomberg. Separately Forbes estimates his current wealth at $2.1 billion.

Separately Forbes estimates his current wealth at $2.1 billion. Trump's personal income is unknown because he lists business revenue instead of profit on his financial disclosures.

Mixing Business and Politics

Trump's potential conflicts of interest were a prominent topic throughout his tenure from 2017 through 2020. As president the enormous power he had at his command made it more important than ever to understand his long list of businesses and how they could intersect with his public role as president.

These conflicts of interest did not pose a legal problem for Trump. The president and vice president are explicitly exempt from ethics regulations concerning conflicts of interest.

There were other issues though such as the emoluments clause which was written into the U.S. Constitution by the nation's founders. The clause prohibits the president from accepting things of value from foreign governments.

Many critics say the emoluments clause applies to Trump in several respects. But none of the many legal cases alleging violations by the former president have been concluded nor does it look like they will be in the near future.

The President's Trust

Most U.S. presidents for the past 40 years chose to put their investments into a blind trust to avoid real or perceived conflicts between the president's financial interests and the nation's best interests.

The owner of a blind trust has no knowledge or control over what assets are in the trust. Their use is a guard against accusations that the powers of the presidency are being used to benefit the office holder's financial interests.

One exception was President Barack Obama who did not use a blind trust because his only investments were in such vehicles as index funds and Treasury notes which were unlikely to pose conflicts of interest.

To create a blind trust it is first necessary to liquidate all of the trust owner's current assets so that new ones can be placed into the trust. Trump's assets were largely in highly illiquid real estate. They would have been costly and time-consuming or even impossible to liquidate. For example Trump can't sell his minority stakes in some office towers without the consent of the real-estate investment trust Vornado Realty Trust (VNO).

So Trump ignored this presidential norm instead of placing his assets in a trust that was managed by his two eldest sons. He was able to withdraw funds from the trust at any time for any reason without disclosing it.

In fact Eric Trump one of the trustees told Forbes in early 2017 that he planned to regularly update his father on the Trump family businesses.

This practice violates trust documents stating that trustees ""shall not provide any report to Donald J. Trump on the holdings and sources of income of the Trust.""

The result was that the president's businesses were held by a trust controlled by his sons and the ability of the trust to insulate the former president from conflicts of interest was questionable.

What We Know

The former president's business activities are largely opaque for several reasons. Trump's main company formally called the Trump Organization is a privately held business and is therefore not required to publish quarterly earnings releases like publicly traded companies do.

The former president has also notably refused to release his tax returns contrary to the recent practice of presidents.

Trump's annual financial disclosures to the U.S. Office of Government Ethics had become the primary avenue to assess what businesses the former president owned and how much they were making.

Every year the president is required to file a list of assets income sources positions held outside the U.S. government business transactions liabilities and gifts received. But in some instances critics say the former president had been reluctant to fully comply with these disclosure requests by delaying filing and going to unusual lengths to avoid providing clear answers to the public.

On Sept. 27 2020 The New York Times released two stories containing data from some 20 years of Trump's tax returns. The full records have not been released.

What We Don't Know

There are some caveats to keep in mind when assessing the data in the Trump Organization's financial disclosure forms.

First the data is unaudited self-reported data meaning that readers have to take the company's word that it's accurate.

Second many of the numbers listed as ""income"" from certain assets seem instead to be the revenue from those businesses. This was confirmed when data from Trump's tax returns were released by The New York Times showing that many of the businesses have been losing money including some of the largest revenue producers such as Trump National Doral golf resort.

That being the case the financial numbers don't show the amount of money that the former president actually took home as income. For example in Trump's 2017 disclosure he listed his income for the Trump National Doral golf resort as $75 million which matches the revenue number reported to Miami-Dade County. Net operating income for the resort for that year was dramatically smaller at $4.3 million.

Getting a clear picture of the former president's businesses is further complicated by the fact that income and asset values are listed in very wide ranges. For example Mar-a-Lago Club is listed as having a value of ""over $50000000."" The Trump National Golf Club in Charlotte is listed as worth between $5 million and $25 million.

Contradictions

Yet another complication is that the Trump Organization itself has contradicted its own numbers in disclosures. The Trump Organization contested Palm Beach County's $19.7 million valuation for the Trump International Golf Club in Jupiter Florida as being too high.

But the former president's government disclosure to the Office of Government Ethics valued the property at more than $50 million. This inflated the value of the former president's property to the public even as he was trying to deflate its value for tax purposes.

This lack of information means that any attempt to put a number on the former president's net worth is at best an educated guess and would require more information than has been disclosed.

Equally important: Because we do not know the expenses of the businesses listed it is impossible to figure out Trump's personal income from his own disclosures.

The Investigations

Public prosecutors are trying to answer these and similar questions. Trump and his company are being investigated by the New York State attorney general over how the Trump Organization values assets on financial statements used to obtain loans.

The Manhattan district attorney appears to be investigating similar claims of inflated asset values. The former president's former lawyer Michael Cohen has testified that Trump regularly inflated the value of company assets to get better loan terms.

On Feb. 22 2021 the U.S. Supreme Court allowed a subpoena by Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. for Donald Trump's tax returns as well as other financial records. Due to grand jury secrecy rules they were not made public.

All of these developments cast doubt on the value of unaudited self-reported financial data from the Trump Organization.

Trump's Current Wealth

Despite these obstacles valuable information can be gleaned from Trump's financial disclosures especially in concert with other information.

Forbes has used financial disclosures and a plethora of other sources to come up with an estimate of Trump's net worth after he left office. The publication currently pegs it at around $2.4 billion. This should be regarded as a rough estimate even though the publication did as thorough a job as possible given the dearth of information.

This $2.4 billion represents a significant drop having fallen from $3.1 billion since the end of 2019. This is largely due to the damage COVID-19 has done to the hotel and casino industries.

The second important financial number we can glean from these documents is that Trump and his businesses generated a minimum of $446.3 million in revenue in 2019 which is up 2.6% from $434.8 million the previous year.

Also available are specific revenue numbers for some of Trump's business interests. The numbers provide a general idea of which Trump businesses are the largest revenue generators and whether revenue is rising or declining.

The Real Sources of Wealth

The former president's businesses generally fall into five categories: hotels golf courses (or some combination of the two) condos residential and commercial real-estate rentals and payments for the licensing of Trump's name.

The New York Times articles unleashed a major new source of information besides confirming that Donald Trump's disclosed income numbers were actually revenue figures.

The numbers also show that companies owned by Trump were incredibly unprofitable for the period between 2000 and 2018. His real sources of income were a television show and some licensing deals.

Although certain enterprises such as Trump Tower have been profitable Trump businesses overall lost $174.5 million from 2000–2018. During the same period of time his net income from licensing and endorsement deals was $230 million his net income from The Apprentice television show was $197.3 million and his income from other investments in companies run by other people was $178.7 million.

Top 5 Businesses Owned by Donald Trump

The list below is limited to businesses for which a specific revenue amount was given. The numbers are the latest available from documents.

1. Trump National Doral

2019 Revenue: $77207936

2018 Revenue: $75962848

2019 Asset Value: Over $50000000

Business Type: Golf Resort

What is now the Trump National Doral golf resort was founded in 1962 in Doral near Miami. Trump bought the resort out of bankruptcy for $150 million in 2012.

The Doral was the source of considerable controversy in 2019 when the former president announced plans to hold the 2020 meeting of the G7 at Trump National Doral. He withdrew the proposal after accusations that this was an attempt to profit from his presidency.

2. Trump Old Post Office LLC

2019 Revenue: $40523041

2018 Revenue: $40842294

2019 Asset Value: Over $50000000

Business Type: Hotel

This business is a holding company for the Trump International Hotel in Washington D.C. which operates in the Old Post Office building a national landmark. Trump's company holds a long-term lease on the property owned by the U.S. government which could last nearly 100 years with extensions.

The hotel was at the center of a major emoluments case against the former president. A group of hotel and restaurant owners sued Trump for violating the emoluments clause alleging that he was unconstitutionally profiting from his office because his hotel gets the business of foreign officials staying there to curry his favor. The group argued that this gave the former president's hotel an unfair competitive advantage against their businesses.

Possibly as a result of lawsuits and public criticism the Trump Organization planned to sell its lease to the property. They were seeking a purchase price of more than $500 million one of the highest-priced hotel deals per room ever. The sale process was placed on hold due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

3. Trump Ruffin Tower LLC

2019 Revenue: $27677448 divided between $4414500 in condo sales and $23262948 in hotel revenue

2018 Revenue: $28558298 divided between $6002244 in condo sales and $22556054 in hotel revenue

2019 Asset Value: Over $50000000

Business Type: Hotel and Condominium Complex

Trump Ruffin Tower LLC manages the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Las Vegas. Constructed in 2008 the tower is a combination hotel and condominium development.

It struggled as the Great Recession hit when it opened more than a decade ago devastating the real estate market. Plans for a second tower were scrapped.

4. Trump Turnberry

2019 Revenue: 25691318

2018 Revenue: $23446634

2019 Asset Value: Over $50000000

Business Type: Golf Resort

Originally built in 1906 by Archibald Kennedy the third Marquess of Ailsa Trump Turnberry is one of two golf resorts the former president owns in Scotland.

Trump purchased the Turnberry resort from a Dubai-based company for an undisclosed sum.

5. Mar-a-Lago Club LLC

2019 Revenue: 21432344

2018 Revenue: $22692146

2019 Asset Value: Over $50000000

Business Type: Hotel and Resort

The Mar-a-Lago Club was built as a private mansion in 1927 by Marjorie Merriweather Post who inherited the Postum Cereal Company which later became the General Foods Corporation.

In 1968 she decided to donate Mar-a-Lago to the U.S. government to serve as a winter White House. When she died in 1973 the government refused the gift due to its high maintenance costs.

The estate was purchased by Trump in 1985 for a reported $8 million. He used it as a winter White House and continues to operate it as a private resort club.

2020 Challenges

The year 2020 was challenging for the former president's businesses because the COVID-19 pandemic hit the hospitality industry hard.

A study by the American Hotel & Lodging Association (AHLA) found that nearly nine in 10 hotels resorted to furloughs or layoffs in 2020. More than half of the hotel owners surveyed said they were in danger of losing their properties to foreclosure.

The Trump Organization laid off roughly 1500 employees due to COVID-19 as of the beginning of April 2020 including 560 at Trump National Doral.

Trump's largest business by revenue Trump National Doral had to close in March along with many of his other properties.

It reopened in June 2020 along with several other Trump hotels.

Trump's Failed Businesses

Trump's current businesses give only a partial picture of his record as a businessman. Over the course of his several decades as a real estate executive he has created a long list of companies that have been sold or dissolved or which have gone bankrupt.

Trump companies have filed for bankruptcy six separate times a fact Trump has bragged about saying he has ""used brilliantly the laws of the country.""

One Decade of Business Dealings

A useful snapshot is Trump's record during the 10 years before he won the presidency. From 2006–2016 The New York Times went through every business deal that the Trump Organization announced or that was reported.

The 60 deals reflected a highly uneven track record of business success: ""One-third of them never got off the ground or soon petered out. Another third delivered a measure of what was promised—buildings were built courses taught a product introduced—but they also encountered substantial problems like lawsuits government investigations partnership woes or market downturns...The remaining third while sometimes encountering strife generally met expectations"" according to The New York Times.

Any deeper examination of the former president's business record would be incomplete without looking at his series of high-profile bankruptcies and other failures. Below is a list of some of the highlights although it is by no means comprehensive.

Trump's Casinos

In the early 1990s Donald Trump faced personal bankruptcy due to large personal debts deteriorating finances and a trio of money-losing casinos in Atlantic City. His largest casino Trump Taj Mahal had already declared bankruptcy in 1991.

To deal with this Trump launched an initial public offering (IPO) of Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts. The public offering raised enough money for Trump to avoid personal bankruptcy and allowed him to offload his heavily indebted casinos to investors. Trump stepped down in 2009 as chairperson of the company whose name had been changed to Trump Entertainment Resorts in 2005.

By then the company had gone through bankruptcy twice and investors had lost ""well over 90 cents on the dollar"" according to billionaire Warren Buffett.

Trump Entertainment Resorts went back into bankruptcy in 2014 and was sold to Icahn Enterprises (IEP) in 2016 resulting in Trump losing his stake in the company. The Taj Mahal which Trump spent $1.2 billion to build in 1990 was later sold by Icahn Enterprises for $50 million or 4% of its cost to Hard Rock International in 2017.

Trump Model Management

Trump Model Management was a modeling agency Trump founded. The company is a natural extension of Trump's interest in beauty pageants with his production company formerly producing Miss USA pageants and a TV tie-in titled Pageant Place.

In April 2017 news that Trump Model Management would shut down surfaced after an email from the company's president leaked. Some speculate that the decision to shut down was due to the accusations from some foreign-born former models that they had been hired without the necessary work visas.

Trump Model Management denied using illegal labor practices. Trump himself held an 85% stake in the business before it dissolved.

The Trump Entrepreneur Initiative

The now-defunct Trump Entrepreneur Initiative was once known as Trump University. The for-profit education company offered courses in real estate asset management entrepreneurship and wealth creation.

The company was not an accredited school and did not offer high school or college credits.

The company was embroiled in an ongoing high-profile scandal during Trump's presidential campaign and it continued into his tenure as president.

The Trump Entrepreneur Initiative faced a lawsuit in 2013 alleging illegal business practices. The New York state attorney general filed a $40 million civil suit that alleged the corporation made false promises to its students.

A New York judge found Trump personally responsible. In late March 2017 when Trump was serving as president a judge approved a $25 million settlement for the defrauded students.

Trump Ice Natural Spring Water

Trump Ice was a bottled water brand. The winner of The Apprentice Season 2 Kelly Perdew served as executive vice president of the organization.

The company's website no longer exists and the product can no longer be found in national grocery chains or stores but some can still be found on eBay and other auction sites.

The company was used as a gimmick in the show's first season when contestants marketed and sold the product.

Trump Steaks

Launched in 2007 Trump Steaks was a line of beef products sold exclusively by The Sharper Image and QVC. Due to poor sales the products were removed from distribution after just two months."

In this post I'll explain why your FICO score is so important how it's calculated and how you can learn what it is by taking advantage of the rapidly expanding list of credit cards that will tell you your score for free.

For more TPG news delivered each morning to your inbox sign up for our daily newsletter.

Your FICO score is instrumental in how financial institutions view your creditworthiness.

What are the different kinds of credit scores?

While there was originally only one FICO score companies have developed different ways to measure your creditworthiness as time has passed. These include the FICO score 8 or 9 as well as the VantageScore 3.0 and 4.0.

There are several differences between the two methods. The FICO scores 8 and 9 offer slightly different scores for each of the three major credit bureaus while VantageScore offers a single number for all three bureaus. Other differences include importance given to bills sent to collection credit utilization and hard inquiries.

Importance of the FICO credit score

Your FICO score (a product of the Fair Isaac Corporation) is the foundation of most financial transactions you make. If you want a loan at competitive interest rates be approved for a credit card or pass a background check you need to have an acceptable FICO score. Knowing your score can help you anticipate what to expect from these kinds of transactions.

Your FICO score isn't static. It evolves with your finances and you can improve (or damage) it depending on your degree of fiscal responsibility. That's important because it means you can cultivate a high score over time with good financial habits even if you have bad credit (or no credit). Your FICO score allows you to track the state of your finances and can alert you to any problems such as a missed payment or identity theft.

Knowing your FICO score is helpful when it comes to travel rewards because it can give you a sense of which credit cards you're likely to be approved for allowing you to maximize your applications.

The FICO formula is kept private but we know the factors that affect your score. (Image courtesy of Shutterstock)

How your FICO score is determined

TPG has written previously about how your FICO score is compiled; here's a brief refresher:

35% payment history

30% amounts owed

15% length of credit history

10% new credit

10% types of credit

The factors that affect your score the most are late or missed payments and your credit utilization — also known as the ratio of how much credit you're using to how much credit is available to you.

Length of credit history also affects your score so it makes sense to keep your oldest accounts open unless you have a compelling reason to close them. Negative ""remarks"" (like a late payment or accounts in collections) stay on your credit report for seven years. That's a long time to pay for a mistake and have it be an obstacle to earning points and miles. Fortunately negative remarks affect your score less and less as they age.

Credit cards that show your score

The good news is that accessing your FICO score for free is now easier than ever thanks in large part to the FICO Score Open Access Program launched by the Fair Isaac Corporation. This program allows credit card issuers that have already purchased the FICO information to share it with customers at no additional charge.

The following credit card issuers now offer your FICO score for free either online or with your monthly statement.

American Express provides its cardholders with not only an educational FICO score but also their Fico Score 8. The latter number is the credit score the issuer uses to manage cardmembers' accounts and is based on data from a major credit-rating agency Experian. Current cardholders can log into their accounts and access their score through account services.

Fortunately most credit cards offer the ability to view your FICO score without hurting your credit so you'll want to make a habit of using these free services regularly.

Barrett” embossed on them. Their business cards are issued to “Barrett Group” or “Barrett Connect.” Barrett happened to be a graphic designer for Chase and his name went on a card and it stuck.

American Express sample cards bear the name “C F Frost” but many years ago were issued to “John Q Public.” Frost was an Ogilvy & Mather executive who worked on the Amex account in the 1960s. Wells Fargo uses Henry Wells for obvious reasons.

Filed under “Today I Learned” I’ve just discovered who the Linda Walker is that has graced sample Citibank credit cards for 30 years.

This is the subject of occasional online speculation for instance wondering about Linda Walker’s total credit line from Citi and whether it’s advisable for her to have so many cards.

Even sample Costco reward certificates are issued to Linda Walker.

It turns out that just like at other issuers Linda Walker is a real person. She’s just retired from Citibank. For the past 10 years she’s overseen Citi’s anti-money laundering compliance. Before that she spent 14 years at UBS and Prudential. And from 1989 to 1997 she served as Associate General Counsel at Citi.

And it’s her name that’s appeared in Citibank card advertising for the last three decades.

[I]t was great that Citi paid tribute to my being the “Name That’s Synonymous with Citi Cards” stating in an internal article “When it comes to making a name for herself Linda Walker has set the bar pretty high. Her name is ubiquitous in its appearance on Citi branded cards featured on TV in digital marketing in print and as part of marketing mailers for the last three decades.”

And no she does not have one of every Citibank credit card issued in the past three decades..

Update: A Chase insider tells me that while their communications team has alternatively suggested ‘D Barrett’ is in customer service marketing or technology that isn’t correct – but that it is an employee who may prefer not to have her story told.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5hbHBoYXN0cmVldC5jb20vZWFybmluZ3MtY2FsZW5kYXItZm9yLXRoZS13ZWVrLW9mLWp1bHktMjYv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Earnings calendar for the week of July 26,"After showing weakness at the beginning of the week benchmark stock indexes made steady gains even as economic recovery gathered steam. On Friday the S&P 500 index crossed the 4400-mark for the first time while the Dow Jones Industrial Average moved past 35000 and reached a new high. Meanwhile weekly jobless claims increased unexpectedly to around 419000 dampening hopes of labor market recovery.

Continuing its buyout spree Accenture bought two technology companies early this week — Toronto-based Oracle cloud service provider Cloudworks and workforce optimization consultancy Workforce Insight – and completed the previously announced acquisition of France-based cybersecurity firm Openminded.

In another tech deal Microsoft agreed to acquire security start-up CloudKnox. Meanwhile Visa clinched a deal to buy Currencycloud for about 700 million pounds.

The airline industry dominated the earnings scene this week with United Airlines reporting results on Tuesday and Southwest Airlines and American Airlines releasing their second-quarter statements on Thursday. Earlier IBM came out with positive numbers for its most recent quarter on Monday. The next day all eyes were on streaming giant Netflix which published mixed results in the after-hours.

Energy firm Kinder Morgan Seagate Technology Verizon soft drink major Coca-Cola and Johnson & Johnson stole the show on Wednesday. Thursday was as busy as usual with the major events being the second-quarter earnings releases of telecom firm AT&T fast-food chain Domino’s Pizza Biogen Abbott Laboratories Intel as well as social networking platforms Twitter and Snap. Schlumberger American Express and Kimberly-Clark reported Friday before the opening bell.

While Lockheed Martin is probably the only major company to report earnings on July 26 the market will be closely following the report of Alphabet on July 27. The Google parent will be joined by gadget giant Apple chipmaker AMD Starbucks and Microsoft in the after-hours. Before the opening bell aviation firm JetBlue and engineering behemoth General Electric are scheduled to report earnings.

The financial releases of Bristol-Myers Squibb aircraft builder Boeing and Ford Motor are the key events slated for July 28. The next day is going to be as hectic when the earnings announcements of e-commerce giant Amazon.com Altria Group Yum! Brands and Merck & Co. are on tap. Procter & Gamble oil giant ExxonMobil and Caterpillar are among the major companies preparing to report on July 30.

Captain America The First Avenger was released 10 years and saw Steve Rogers frozen for 60 years before being thawed out in the present day. The World War II hero had barely begun his relationship with Peggy Carter and by the time he was reunited with her she was an old lady. Aside from a brief kiss with her niece Sharon Carter some Marvel fans have assumed Cap was always a virgin. Join Disney+ to watch Captain America The First Avenger.

In fact when Avengers Infinity War came out some were concerned Captain America would die a virgin. But in the end Steve Rogers survived to the end of Avengers Endgame and went back in time to marry Peggy Carter in an alternate timeline. So some fans believe Cap only lost his virginity on his wedding night in the 1940s. However Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely who penned all three Captain America movies plus Avengers Infinity War and Avengers Endgame believe Steve had sex before he was frozen.

Berlin was voted to host the 1936 Olympic Games in 1931 before the Nazi Party came to power in Germany. Proposed boycotts of the Berlin Olympics arose in many Western countries who were appalled by Germany’s racist policies and human rights violations. Still 49 countries attended the games in Berlin the most countries to attend an Olympiad up to that date. The German government used the international spotlight as an opportunity to portray the country as a benign and progressive nation while also providing fuel for its Aryan-superiority propaganda the latter of which the IOC specifically prohibited. The 1936 Berlin Olympics Games and the controversy of American participation in those games was the first of the so-called political Olympics games. For Hitler the 1936 games were a pageant for Nazi propaganda. The United States and the world had an opportunity to stand up against Hitler’s Germany and boycott the games. Why didn’t they?

For a year American athletic organizations debated boycotting the Berlin Olympics in response to the treatment of Jewish people in Germany and Austria. In a formal vote in 1935 the Amateur Athletic Union narrowly rejected a boycott resolution. The American Olympic Committee headed by Avery Brundage encouraged American athletes to participate. This encouragement in turn legitimized the Hitler regime and was seen by some including the Washington Post as wasting an opportunity “to let the Germans see what the outside world thinks of their present ruler.” Avery Brundage opposed the boycott arguing that politics had no place in sports. What was President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s view on boycotting the 1936 Berlin games? FDR did not get involved in the boycott issue despite protests from high level American diplomats within his administration. Both the U.S. ambassador to Germany William E. Dodd and George Messersmith head of the U.S. Legation in Vienna deplored the American Olympic Committee’s decision to go to Berlin. In choosing not to involve himself in the boycott issue Roosevelt followed a 40-year tradition in which the American Olympic Committee operated independently of outside influence.

There were short-lived boycott efforts that surfaced in Great Britain France Sweden Czechoslovakia and the Netherlands. Additionally German Socialists and Communists in exile voiced their opposition to the games through publications such as Arbeiter Illustrierte Zeitung (The Worker Illustrated Newspaper). Debate over the participation in the 1936 games in the United States was fierce. Some athletes wanted to go to show the best way to beat the Nazis was in the Olympic arena. Others thought US participation would equate an endorsement of the Third Reich. Ultimately the boycott movement failed in the United States. Some boycott proponents supported a “counter Olympics.” One of the largest was the “People’s Olympiad” planned for summer 1936 in Barcelona Spain. It was cancelled after the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in July 1936 just as thousands of athletes had begun to arrive.

The Games were not without controversy for another reason as well. Though the IOC required that Germany accept qualified Jewish athletes to represescoopnest.comnt them in Berlin Jewish-American athletes Marty Glickman and Sam Stoller were denied from running the 400-meter relay by the American Olympic Committee (AOC). Many believed that the AOC did not want to offend Hitler and were outraged that Glickman and Stoller were not allowed to participate in the Games. The two were replaced by Jesse Owens and Ralph Metcalfe.

Record breaking American sprinter and long jumper Jesse Owens an African American won four gold medals and in essence destroyed any attempt Germany had at proving white supremacy through the Games. Hitler reportedly only shook hands with German and Finnish medalist winners leading many to believe that he snubbed Owens in the wake of his historic victories. Years later Owens recalled that the two had only “exchanged congratulatory waves”. But Owens felt more neglected by FDR than Hitler saying “that the president didn’t even send a telegram” or publicly acknowledge him or any of the 18 African Americans who competed in Berlin. Eighty years later President Obama met with the families of the African American athletes who competed at the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin and offered praise. President Obama said: “It wasn’t just Jesse. It was other African Americans athletes in the middle of Nazi Germany under the gaze of Adolf Hitler that put a lie to notions of racial superiority-whooped’em- and taught them a thing or two about democracy and taught them a thing or two about the American character.”

These events have been opportunities to celebrate the hard work athleticism and mental strength of athletes from all over the world. In theory any political riffs are supposed to be set aside at least for the duration of the Olympics so that for a moment the world can be at peace. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) even promotes the concept of the “Olympic Truce” in its charter a policy which was observed during the ancient Olympics. Despite the IOC’s goals for international peace during the games politics have disrupted the Olympic games throughout modern history whether by boycotts propaganda or protests.

SAITAMA Japan (AP) — When the Dream Team era started in 1992 most of the NBA players in the Olympics represented the United States.

David Stern knew what would happen from there.

“In time” the former NBA commissioner predicted in 1995 “that will change.”

Stern was right. The number of international players in the NBA has steadily risen since -- and the gap between USA Basketball and the rest of the world has tightened as well. There will be more players in this tournament with NBA experience than ever before with nearly 70 players in the Tokyo Olympics either current or former players in the league. More than four dozen of them played in the league this past season.

And only 12 of that group are in Japan to compete with “USA” across their chests.

That’s why when this men’s Olympic tournament opens Sunday the medal possibilities may be as wide open as they have been since that first team of NBA stars took the court in Barcelona. That group — which featured 11 future Hall of Famers on a 12-man roster — showed the rest of the world how much they had to do to catch the red white and blue.

“The gap is smaller and smaller every year as far as talent is concerned” U.S. coach Gregg Popovich said.

The U.S. is seeking a fourth consecutive gold medal and is the big favorite to do just that according to FanDuel The Americans are the only team in Tokyo with 12 NBA players. But like Popovich said and Stern anticipated years ago the talent gap has drastically dwindled.

Nigeria which beat the Americans in an exhibition has eight NBA players. Australia which also defeated the U.S. in a warm-up game has seven. So does France the first U.S. opponent in this tournament on Sunday and the nation that knocked the Americans out of contention at the Basketball World Cup two years ago. That setback sent the team spiraling to a seventh-place finish the worst showing in any tournament ever for an American roster composed of NBA players.

“I think every team wants to beat us” U.S. forward Kevin Durant said. “Everybody wants to see us lose so every game has a little bit more pressure to it.”

There’s only one current All-NBA first team player in these Olympics. He doesn’t play for the U.S.

Slovenia’s Luka Doncic garnered more first-team votes in the All-NBA voting this season 55 than the entire U.S. Olympic roster got combined. This is Slovenia’s first time in the Olympics but with Doncic leading the way medal talk doesn’t seem misguided.

“Slovenians we know how to fight man” Doncic said. “We’re not going to go down easy.”

Doncic willed Slovenia to a win in the Olympic qualifying tournament that ended on July 4 and gave the tiny nation a spot in the Tokyo field. And what he’s done in his NBA tenure with Dallas has only shown the world that the buzz he arrived with was more than appropriate.

“He’s a spectacular player as we all know” Popovich said. “He’s one of the best players in the world. And I emphasize in the world. He showed himself early on in Europe and he was a fast study in the NBA for sure. He’s fun to watch. His skills his competitiveness his size his innate basketball IQ is so impressive. You put four hardworking people around him and you’ve got a hell of a team.”

Some of what to watch:

THE SCHEDULE

There are 12 teams in the field; four will have to wait until Monday for their Olympic openers. Sunday’s schedule has Iran vs. the Czech Republic Germany vs. Italy Australia vs. Nigeria and then the U.S. vs. France. The Monday men’s openers are Argentina vs. Slovenia and host Japan vs. reigning World Cup champion Spain.

INTERNATIONAL HEAT

The Miami Heat have four players at the Olympics but only one plays for the U.S. The Heat have three players on Nigeria’s roster (KZ Okpala Precious Achiuwa and Gabe Vincent Nnamdi) with Bam Adebayo playing for the U.S.

ONLY ONE

The only men’s team in the Olympic field without a current NBA player is Iran. That roster does however have a former NBA player — Hamed Haddadi who appeared in 151 games over parts of five NBA seasons for Memphis and Phoenix. He last appeared in the NBA in 2013.

NOT JUST THE MEN

The women’s game is going on the same trajectory as the men’s when it comes to having more international players with WNBA experience in these Olympics than in any previous games. The U.S. has 12 WNBA players on its roster while Australia has nine current or former WNBA players and Canada has eight.

THEY SAID IT

Slovenia coach Aleksander Sekulić on what Doncic does for a team: “Everything looks way easier and he’s making other players good. Also me myself.”

Donald J. Trump the nation's 45th president is unique among U.S. presidents in his connections to the business world. Certainly there have been presidents before him who were businessmen: both George H.W. Bush and his son George W. were in the oil business. Herbert Hoover was in mining and Warren G. Harding was in the newspaper business.

The difference is that every president before Trump had held one or more government positions before taking the office or had served as a general in the military.

This means that Trump's business record and the performance of his companies were the public's only basis for measuring his professional performance before he became president.

We know considerably more now although there is still much to know. Here's what we know and don't know about Trump's business dealings his successes and failures and his financial health as he left the presidency.

Key Takeaways Trump's businesses generated at least $446.3 million in sales in 2019. That dropped about 40% to $278 million in 2020.

The Trump National Doral golf resort generated the most revenue of any of the former president's businesses in 2019 posting $77.2 million in sales. Its revenue plunged more than 40% in 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic year.

Trump's net worth slipped to about $2.3 billion during his presidency compared to about $3 billion before he took office according to Bloomberg. Separately Forbes estimates his current wealth at $2.1 billion.

Separately Forbes estimates his current wealth at $2.1 billion. Trump's personal income is unknown because he lists business revenue instead of profit on his financial disclosures.

Mixing Business and Politics

Trump's potential conflicts of interest were a prominent topic throughout his tenure from 2017 through 2020. As president the enormous power he had at his command made it more important than ever to understand his long list of businesses and how they could intersect with his public role as president.

These conflicts of interest did not pose a legal problem for Trump. The president and vice president are explicitly exempt from ethics regulations concerning conflicts of interest.

There were other issues though such as the emoluments clause which was written into the U.S. Constitution by the nation's founders. The clause prohibits the president from accepting things of value from foreign governments.

Many critics say the emoluments clause applies to Trump in several respects. But none of the many legal cases alleging violations by the former president have been concluded nor does it look like they will be in the near future.

The President's Trust

Most U.S. presidents for the past 40 years chose to put their investments into a blind trust to avoid real or perceived conflicts between the president's financial interests and the nation's best interests.

The owner of a blind trust has no knowledge or control over what assets are in the trust. Their use is a guard against accusations that the powers of the presidency are being used to benefit the office holder's financial interests.

One exception was President Barack Obama who did not use a blind trust because his only investments were in such vehicles as index funds and Treasury notes which were unlikely to pose conflicts of interest.

To create a blind trust it is first necessary to liquidate all of the trust owner's current assets so that new ones can be placed into the trust. Trump's assets were largely in highly illiquid real estate. They would have been costly and time-consuming or even impossible to liquidate. For example Trump can't sell his minority stakes in some office towers without the consent of the real-estate investment trust Vornado Realty Trust (VNO).

So Trump ignored this presidential norm instead of placing his assets in a trust that was managed by his two eldest sons. He was able to withdraw funds from the trust at any time for any reason without disclosing it.

In fact Eric Trump one of the trustees told Forbes in early 2017 that he planned to regularly update his father on the Trump family businesses.

This practice violates trust documents stating that trustees ""shall not provide any report to Donald J. Trump on the holdings and sources of income of the Trust.""

The result was that the president's businesses were held by a trust controlled by his sons and the ability of the trust to insulate the former president from conflicts of interest was questionable.

What We Know

The former president's business activities are largely opaque for several reasons. Trump's main company formally called the Trump Organization is a privately held business and is therefore not required to publish quarterly earnings releases like publicly traded companies do.

The former president has also notably refused to release his tax returns contrary to the recent practice of presidents.

Trump's annual financial disclosures to the U.S. Office of Government Ethics had become the primary avenue to assess what businesses the former president owned and how much they were making.

Every year the president is required to file a list of assets income sources positions held outside the U.S. government business transactions liabilities and gifts received. But in some instances critics say the former president had been reluctant to fully comply with these disclosure requests by delaying filing and going to unusual lengths to avoid providing clear answers to the public.

On Sept. 27 2020 The New York Times released two stories containing data from some 20 years of Trump's tax returns. The full records have not been released.

What We Don't Know

There are some caveats to keep in mind when assessing the data in the Trump Organization's financial disclosure forms.

First the data is unaudited self-reported data meaning that readers have to take the company's word that it's accurate.

Second many of the numbers listed as ""income"" from certain assets seem instead to be the revenue from those businesses. This was confirmed when data from Trump's tax returns were released by The New York Times showing that many of the businesses have been losing money including some of the largest revenue producers such as Trump National Doral golf resort.

That being the case the financial numbers don't show the amount of money that the former president actually took home as income. For example in Trump's 2017 disclosure he listed his income for the Trump National Doral golf resort as $75 million which matches the revenue number reported to Miami-Dade County. Net operating income for the resort for that year was dramatically smaller at $4.3 million.

Getting a clear picture of the former president's businesses is further complicated by the fact that income and asset values are listed in very wide ranges. For example Mar-a-Lago Club is listed as having a value of ""over $50000000."" The Trump National Golf Club in Charlotte is listed as worth between $5 million and $25 million.

Contradictions

Yet another complication is that the Trump Organization itself has contradicted its own numbers in disclosures. The Trump Organization contested Palm Beach County's $19.7 million valuation for the Trump International Golf Club in Jupiter Florida as being too high.

But the former president's government disclosure to the Office of Government Ethics valued the property at more than $50 million. This inflated the value of the former president's property to the public even as he was trying to deflate its value for tax purposes.

This lack of information means that any attempt to put a number on the former president's net worth is at best an educated guess and would require more information than has been disclosed.

Equally important: Because we do not know the expenses of the businesses listed it is impossible to figure out Trump's personal income from his own disclosures.

The Investigations

Public prosecutors are trying to answer these and similar questions. Trump and his company are being investigated by the New York State attorney general over how the Trump Organization values assets on financial statements used to obtain loans.

The Manhattan district attorney appears to be investigating similar claims of inflated asset values. The former president's former lawyer Michael Cohen has testified that Trump regularly inflated the value of company assets to get better loan terms.

On Feb. 22 2021 the U.S. Supreme Court allowed a subpoena by Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. for Donald Trump's tax returns as well as other financial records. Due to grand jury secrecy rules they were not made public.

All of these developments cast doubt on the value of unaudited self-reported financial data from the Trump Organization.

Trump's Current Wealth

Despite these obstacles valuable information can be gleaned from Trump's financial disclosures especially in concert with other information.

Forbes has used financial disclosures and a plethora of other sources to come up with an estimate of Trump's net worth after he left office. The publication currently pegs it at around $2.4 billion. This should be regarded as a rough estimate even though the publication did as thorough a job as possible given the dearth of information.

This $2.4 billion represents a significant drop having fallen from $3.1 billion since the end of 2019. This is largely due to the damage COVID-19 has done to the hotel and casino industries.

The second important financial number we can glean from these documents is that Trump and his businesses generated a minimum of $446.3 million in revenue in 2019 which is up 2.6% from $434.8 million the previous year.

Also available are specific revenue numbers for some of Trump's business interests. The numbers provide a general idea of which Trump businesses are the largest revenue generators and whether revenue is rising or declining.

The Real Sources of Wealth

The former president's businesses generally fall into five categories: hotels golf courses (or some combination of the two) condos residential and commercial real-estate rentals and payments for the licensing of Trump's name.

The New York Times articles unleashed a major new source of information besides confirming that Donald Trump's disclosed income numbers were actually revenue figures.

The numbers also show that companies owned by Trump were incredibly unprofitable for the period between 2000 and 2018. His real sources of income were a television show and some licensing deals.

Although certain enterprises such as Trump Tower have been profitable Trump businesses overall lost $174.5 million from 2000–2018. During the same period of time his net income from licensing and endorsement deals was $230 million his net income from The Apprentice television show was $197.3 million and his income from other investments in companies run by other people was $178.7 million.

Top 5 Businesses Owned by Donald Trump

The list below is limited to businesses for which a specific revenue amount was given. The numbers are the latest available from documents.

1. Trump National Doral

2019 Revenue: $77207936

2018 Revenue: $75962848

2019 Asset Value: Over $50000000

Business Type: Golf Resort

What is now the Trump National Doral golf resort was founded in 1962 in Doral near Miami. Trump bought the resort out of bankruptcy for $150 million in 2012.

The Doral was the source of considerable controversy in 2019 when the former president announced plans to hold the 2020 meeting of the G7 at Trump National Doral. He withdrew the proposal after accusations that this was an attempt to profit from his presidency.

2. Trump Old Post Office LLC

2019 Revenue: $40523041

2018 Revenue: $40842294

2019 Asset Value: Over $50000000

Business Type: Hotel

This business is a holding company for the Trump International Hotel in Washington D.C. which operates in the Old Post Office building a national landmark. Trump's company holds a long-term lease on the property owned by the U.S. government which could last nearly 100 years with extensions.

The hotel was at the center of a major emoluments case against the former president. A group of hotel and restaurant owners sued Trump for violating the emoluments clause alleging that he was unconstitutionally profiting from his office because his hotel gets the business of foreign officials staying there to curry his favor. The group argued that this gave the former president's hotel an unfair competitive advantage against their businesses.

Possibly as a result of lawsuits and public criticism the Trump Organization planned to sell its lease to the property. They were seeking a purchase price of more than $500 million one of the highest-priced hotel deals per room ever. The sale process was placed on hold due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

3. Trump Ruffin Tower LLC

2019 Revenue: $27677448 divided between $4414500 in condo sales and $23262948 in hotel revenue

2018 Revenue: $28558298 divided between $6002244 in condo sales and $22556054 in hotel revenue

2019 Asset Value: Over $50000000

Business Type: Hotel and Condominium Complex

Trump Ruffin Tower LLC manages the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Las Vegas. Constructed in 2008 the tower is a combination hotel and condominium development.

It struggled as the Great Recession hit when it opened more than a decade ago devastating the real estate market. Plans for a second tower were scrapped.

4. Trump Turnberry

2019 Revenue: 25691318

2018 Revenue: $23446634

2019 Asset Value: Over $50000000

Business Type: Golf Resort

Originally built in 1906 by Archibald Kennedy the third Marquess of Ailsa Trump Turnberry is one of two golf resorts the former president owns in Scotland.

Trump purchased the Turnberry resort from a Dubai-based company for an undisclosed sum.

5. Mar-a-Lago Club LLC

2019 Revenue: 21432344

2018 Revenue: $22692146

2019 Asset Value: Over $50000000

Business Type: Hotel and Resort

The Mar-a-Lago Club was built as a private mansion in 1927 by Marjorie Merriweather Post who inherited the Postum Cereal Company which later became the General Foods Corporation.

In 1968 she decided to donate Mar-a-Lago to the U.S. government to serve as a winter White House. When she died in 1973 the government refused the gift due to its high maintenance costs.

The estate was purchased by Trump in 1985 for a reported $8 million. He used it as a winter White House and continues to operate it as a private resort club.

2020 Challenges

The year 2020 was challenging for the former president's businesses because the COVID-19 pandemic hit the hospitality industry hard.

A study by the American Hotel & Lodging Association (AHLA) found that nearly nine in 10 hotels resorted to furloughs or layoffs in 2020. More than half of the hotel owners surveyed said they were in danger of losing their properties to foreclosure.

The Trump Organization laid off roughly 1500 employees due to COVID-19 as of the beginning of April 2020 including 560 at Trump National Doral.

Trump's largest business by revenue Trump National Doral had to close in March along with many of his other properties.

It reopened in June 2020 along with several other Trump hotels.

Trump's Failed Businesses

Trump's current businesses give only a partial picture of his record as a businessman. Over the course of his several decades as a real estate executive he has created a long list of companies that have been sold or dissolved or which have gone bankrupt.

Trump companies have filed for bankruptcy six separate times a fact Trump has bragged about saying he has ""used brilliantly the laws of the country.""

One Decade of Business Dealings

A useful snapshot is Trump's record during the 10 years before he won the presidency. From 2006–2016 The New York Times went through every business deal that the Trump Organization announced or that was reported.

The 60 deals reflected a highly uneven track record of business success: ""One-third of them never got off the ground or soon petered out. Another third delivered a measure of what was promised—buildings were built courses taught a product introduced—but they also encountered substantial problems like lawsuits government investigations partnership woes or market downturns...The remaining third while sometimes encountering strife generally met expectations"" according to The New York Times.

Any deeper examination of the former president's business record would be incomplete without looking at his series of high-profile bankruptcies and other failures. Below is a list of some of the highlights although it is by no means comprehensive.

Trump's Casinos

In the early 1990s Donald Trump faced personal bankruptcy due to large personal debts deteriorating finances and a trio of money-losing casinos in Atlantic City. His largest casino Trump Taj Mahal had already declared bankruptcy in 1991.

To deal with this Trump launched an initial public offering (IPO) of Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts. The public offering raised enough money for Trump to avoid personal bankruptcy and allowed him to offload his heavily indebted casinos to investors. Trump stepped down in 2009 as chairperson of the company whose name had been changed to Trump Entertainment Resorts in 2005.

By then the company had gone through bankruptcy twice and investors had lost ""well over 90 cents on the dollar"" according to billionaire Warren Buffett.

Trump Entertainment Resorts went back into bankruptcy in 2014 and was sold to Icahn Enterprises (IEP) in 2016 resulting in Trump losing his stake in the company. The Taj Mahal which Trump spent $1.2 billion to build in 1990 was later sold by Icahn Enterprises for $50 million or 4% of its cost to Hard Rock International in 2017.

Trump Model Management

Trump Model Management was a modeling agency Trump founded. The company is a natural extension of Trump's interest in beauty pageants with his production company formerly producing Miss USA pageants and a TV tie-in titled Pageant Place.

In April 2017 news that Trump Model Management would shut down surfaced after an email from the company's president leaked. Some speculate that the decision to shut down was due to the accusations from some foreign-born former models that they had been hired without the necessary work visas.

Trump Model Management denied using illegal labor practices. Trump himself held an 85% stake in the business before it dissolved.

The Trump Entrepreneur Initiative

The now-defunct Trump Entrepreneur Initiative was once known as Trump University. The for-profit education company offered courses in real estate asset management entrepreneurship and wealth creation.

The company was not an accredited school and did not offer high school or college credits.

The company was embroiled in an ongoing high-profile scandal during Trump's presidential campaign and it continued into his tenure as president.

The Trump Entrepreneur Initiative faced a lawsuit in 2013 alleging illegal business practices. The New York state attorney general filed a $40 million civil suit that alleged the corporation made false promises to its students.

A New York judge found Trump personally responsible. In late March 2017 when Trump was serving as president a judge approved a $25 million settlement for the defrauded students.

Trump Ice Natural Spring Water

Trump Ice was a bottled water brand. The winner of The Apprentice Season 2 Kelly Perdew served as executive vice president of the organization.

The company's website no longer exists and the product can no longer be found in national grocery chains or stores but some can still be found on eBay and other auction sites.

The company was used as a gimmick in the show's first season when contestants marketed and sold the product.

But many of the teams that have been successful in the modern games have benefitted from two key elements: home advantage and favourable politics.

These include the first five hosts from 1896 to 1912 who found it much easier than other nations to get their athletes to participate. At the 1904 games in St Louis Missouri America won nearly 85% of the 280 medals available. At the time travel to the Midwest was laborious and Russia and Japan were at war in the Pacific.

Will Cathcart disclosed the new details about individuals who were targeted in the attack after revelations this week by the Pegasus project a collaboration of 17 media organisations which investigated NSO the Israeli company that sells its powerful surveillance software to government clients around the world.

Cathcart said that he saw parallels between the attack against WhatsApp users in 2019 – which is now the subject of a lawsuit brought by WhatsApp against NSO – and reports about a massive data leak that are at the centre of the Pegasus project.

Quick Guide What is in the Pegasus project data? Show What is in the data leak? The data leak is a list of more than 50000 phone numbers that since 2016 are believed to have been selected as those of people of interest by government clients of NSO Group which sells surveillance software. The data also contains the time and date that numbers were selected or entered on to a system. Forbidden Stories a Paris-based nonprofit journalism organisation and Amnesty International initially had access to the list and shared access with 16 media organisations including the Guardian. More than 80 journalists have worked together over several months as part of the Pegasus project. Amnesty’s Security Lab a technical partner on the project did the forensic analyses. What does the leak indicate? The consortium believes the data indicates the potential targets NSO’s government clients identified in advance of possible surveillance. While the data is an indication of intent the presence of a number in the data does not reveal whether there was an attempt to infect the phone with spyware such as Pegasus the company’s signature surveillance tool or whether any attempt succeeded. The presence in the data of a very small number of landlines and US numbers which NSO says are “technically impossible” to access with its tools reveals some targets were selected by NSO clients even though they could not be infected with Pegasus. However forensic examinations of a small sample of mobile phones with numbers on the list found tight correlations between the time and date of a number in the data and the start of Pegasus activity – in some cases as little as a few seconds. What did forensic analysis reveal? Amnesty examined 67 smartphones where attacks were suspected. Of those 23 were successfully infected and 14 showed signs of attempted penetration. For the remaining 30 the tests were inconclusive in several cases because the handsets had been replaced. Fifteen of the phones were Android devices none of which showed evidence of successful infection. However unlike iPhones phones that use Android do not log the kinds of information required for Amnesty’s detective work. Three Android phones showed signs of targeting such as Pegasus-linked SMS messages. Amnesty shared “backup copies” of four iPhones with Citizen Lab a research group at the University of Toronto that specialises in studying Pegasus which confirmed that they showed signs of Pegasus infection. Citizen Lab also conducted a peer review of Amnesty’s forensic methods and found them to be sound. Which NSO clients were selecting numbers? While the data is organised into clusters indicative of individual NSO clients it does not say which NSO client was responsible for selecting any given number. NSO claims to sell its tools to 60 clients in 40 countries but refuses to identify them. By closely examining the pattern of targeting by individual clients in the leaked data media partners were able to identify 10 governments believed to be responsible for selecting the targets: Azerbaijan Bahrain Kazakhstan Mexico Morocco Rwanda Saudi Arabia Hungary India and the United Arab Emirates. Citizen Lab has also found evidence of all 10 being clients of NSO. What does NSO Group say? You can read NSO Group’s full statement here. The company has always said it does not have access to the data of its customers’ targets. Through its lawyers NSO said the consortium had made “incorrect assumptions” about which clients use the company’s technology. It said the 50000 number was “exaggerated” and that the list could not be a list of numbers “targeted by governments using Pegasus”. The lawyers said NSO had reason to believe the list accessed by the consortium “is not a list of numbers targeted by governments using Pegasus but instead may be part of a larger list of numbers that might have been used by NSO Group customers for other purposes”. They said it was a list of numbers that anyone could search on an open source system. After further questions the lawyers said the consortium was basing its findings “on misleading interpretation of leaked data from accessible and overt basic information such as HLR Lookup services which have no bearing on the list of the customers' targets of Pegasus or any other NSO products ... we still do not see any correlation of these lists to anything related to use of NSO Group technologies”. Following publication they explained that they considered a ""target"" to be a phone that was the subject of a successful or attempted (but failed) infection by Pegasus and reiterated that the list of 50000 phones was too large for it to represent ""targets"" of Pegasus. They said that the fact that a number appeared on the list was in no way indicative of whether it had been selected for surveillance using Pegasus. What is HLR lookup data? The term HLR or home location register refers to a database that is essential to operating mobile phone networks. Such registers keep records on the networks of phone users and their general locations along with other identifying information that is used routinely in routing calls and texts. Telecoms and surveillance experts say HLR data can sometimes be used in the early phase of a surveillance attempt when identifying whether it is possible to connect to a phone. The consortium understands NSO clients have the capability through an interface on the Pegasus system to conduct HLR lookup inquiries. It is unclear whether Pegasus operators are required to conduct HRL lookup inquiries via its interface to use its software; an NSO source stressed its clients may have different reasons – unrelated to Pegasus – for conducting HLR lookups via an NSO system. Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback.

The leak contained tens of thousands of phone numbers of individuals who are believed to have been selected as candidates for possible surveillance by clients of NSO including heads of state such as the French president Emmanuel Macron government ministers diplomats activists journalists human rights defenders and lawyers.

It includes some people whose phones showed infection or traces of NSO’s Pegasus spyware according to examinations of a sample of the devices conducted by Amnesty International’s security lab.

“The reporting matches what we saw in the attack we defeated two years ago it is very consistent with what we were loud about then” Cathcart said in an interview with the Guardian. In addition to the “senior government officials” WhatsApp found that journalists and human rights activists were targeted in the 2019 attack against its users. Many of the targets in the WhatsApp case he said had “no business being under surveillance in any way shape or form”.

“This should be a wake up call for security on the internet … mobile phones are either safe for everyone or they are not safe for everyone.”

When NSO’s Pegasus spyware infects a phone government clients who use it can gain access to an individual’s phone conversations messages photos and location as well as turn the phone into a portable listening device by manipulating its recorder.

The leak contains a list of more than 50000 phone numbers that it is believed have been identified as those of people of interest by clients of NSO since 2016.

The appearance of a number on the leaked list that was accessed by the Pegasus project does not mean it was subject to an attempted or successful hack. NSO said Macron was not a “target” of any of its customers meaning the company denies there was any attempted or successful Pegasus infection of his phone.

NSO has also said the data has “no relevance” to the company and has rejected the reporting by the Pegasus project as “full of wrong assumptions and uncorroborated theories”. It denied that the leaked data represented those targeted for surveillance by the Pegasus software. NSO has called the 50000 number exaggerated and said it was too large to represent individuals targeted by Pegasus.

But Cathcart questioned NSO’s claim that the figure was in itself “exaggerated” saying that WhatsApp had recorded an attack against 1400 users over a two-week period in 2019.

“That tells us that over a longer period of time over a multi-year period of time the numbers of people being attacked are very high” he said. “That’s why we felt it was so important to raise the concern around this.”

When WhatsApp says it believes its users were “targeted” it means the company has evidence that an NSO server attempted to install malware on a user’s device.

NSO has declined to give specific details about its customers and the people they target. However a source has claimed the average number of annual targets per customer was 112.

When WhatsApp announced two years ago that users had been targeted by the NSO malware it said it had found that about 100 of 1400 targets were members of civil society – journalists human rights defenders and activists. The users were targeted through a WhatsApp vulnerability that was later fixed.

Cathcart said he had discussed the 2019 attacks against WhatsApp users with governments all around the world. He praised recent moves by Microsoft and others in the technology industry who are speaking out about the dangers of malware and called on Apple – whose phones are vulnerable to malware infections – to adopt their approach.

“I hope that Apple will start taking that approach too. Be loud join in. It’s not enough to say most of our users don’t need to worry about this. It’s not enough to say ‘oh this is only thousands or tens of thousands of victims’” he said.

“If this is affecting journalists all around the world this is affecting human rights defenders all around the world that affects us all. And if anyone’s phone is not secured that means everyone’s phone is not secure.”

He also called on governments to help create accountability for spyware makers.

“NSO Group claims that a large number of governments are buying their software that means those governments even if their use of it is more controlled those governments are funding this. Should they stop? Should there be a discussion about which governments were paying for this software?”

WhatsApp launched its lawsuit against NSO in late 2019 claiming that the Israeli company was responsible for sending malware to WhatsApp users phones. A judge in the case pointed out that the underlying facts in the case – that malicious code owned by NSO was sent through WhatsApp’s service – did not appear to be disputed. Instead the lawsuit has revolved around whether NSO’s “sovereign customers” were to blame or the company itself.

NSO has argued that it ought to be immune to the suit because its clients are foreign governments. It has said its clients are contractually obliged to use Pegasus to target criminals and that it investigates allegations of abuse. It said it has no insight into how government clients use the spyware or who they target unless the company requests an investigation into allegations of wrongdoing.

An NSO spokesperson said: “We are doing our best to help creating a safer world. Does Mr Cathcart have other alternatives that enable law enforcement and intelligence agencies to legally detect and prevent malicious acts of pedophiles terrorists and criminals using end-to-end encryption platforms? If so we would be happy to hear.”"

Green Mountain Valley School alumnus Ryan Kerrigan of Ripton and his father John Kerrigan from Duxbury have taken on this new endeavor and are traveling with a team of eight young runners – three from Vermont the rest from western U.S. states – for the competition July 30-Aug. 1 in Fonte Cerreto L’Aquila Italy.

Skyrunning is a somewhat new sport to the U.S. that combines climbing and trail-running in some of the most technically challenging mountain locations around the world.

The International Skyrunning Federation is the organization that oversees and hosts skyrunning competitions. Last year’s junior competition and many others were called off due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

According to the federation’s website the sport has unique appeal rooted in its premise to pit athletes against nature in spectacular and rugged mountain environments: “It’s a sport borne in the wild where the logic was to reach the highest peak in the shortest time from a town or village. Today it represents the peak of outdoor running defined by altitude and technicality and counts for 200 races worldwide with over 50000 participants from 65 countries.”

The modern sport of skyrunning evolved from Italian mountaineer Marino Giacometti and a handful of fellow climbers who pioneered races on Mont Blanc and Monte Rosa in the early 1990s. Soon afterward with a corporate sponsor Fila sportswear organized races were established on courses across mountain ranges including the Alps and Himalayas Mount Kenya Scotland’s Highlands and Mexican volcanoes.

Coach Ryan Kerrigan says the courses and conditions athletes face for the competitions are unique with vertical climbs referred to as “VK” races that involve steep descents and often dramatic meteorological shifts.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b250aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxL2p1bC8yNS9hbWVyaWNhcy1uZXctcmVsaWdpb24tZmFrZS1jaHJpc3RpYW5pdHkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,America's new religion: Fake Christianity,"OPINION:

Earlier this month the Western Journal reported that the “American Church Has Fallen: Shocking Poll Shows ‘Fake Christianity’ Has Supplanted the Biblical Worldview.”

Writing for the Journal Rachel Bratton said this: “American Christianity has fallen. Thanks to cultural corrosion and a lack of biblical literacy a new ‘fake Christianity’ is now being preached within the American church.”

“This counterfeit religion is Moralistic Therapeutic Deism” stated Ms. Bratton “a worldview that has quickly gained prominence and given many Americans a theology that looks nothing like historical Christianity despite what they may claim.” She then goes on to cite the recent work of George Barna whose February survey showed that Moralistic Therapeutic Deism (MTD) or — watered-down feel-good fake Christianity — is the most popular worldview in the United States today.

“Christianity in this nation is rotting from the inside out” states Mr. Barna. “MTD is essentially what I would call fake Christianity. Because it has some Christian elements in it but it’s not really biblical it’s not really Christian.”

And what is MTD exactly? Mr. Barna answers: “The moralistic perspective is we’re here to be good people and to try to do good…The therapeutic aspect is everything is supposed to be geared to making me feel good about myself ultimately to make me happy. Deism is the idea that God created the world but has no direct involvement in it. Basically according to MTD there is a distant God who just wants everyone to be nice and the purpose of life is to be happy. American ‘Christians’ who have adopted this philosophy have… elevate[d] personal definitions of right and wrong above any objective standard of Truth — like the Bible.”

And there you have it. America’s religion is no longer that of the Apostles: “the faith that was once and for all entrusted to the saints” (Jude v. 3). Nor is our nation’s guiding ethos that of our founding fathers who proclaimed “it cannot be emphasized too strongly or too often that this great nation was founded not by religionists but by Christians; not on religions but on the gospel of Jesus Christ!” (Patrick Henry).



The faith that motivates Americans today is not the “singular” faith proclaimed by John Wesley (“You must be singular or be damned!”) or the confident faith of Saint Paul (“that Christ died for our sins that he was buried and that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures”) nor is it the creedal conviction of the early Church (“I believe in God the Father Almighty Creator of heaven and earth and in Jesus Christ His only Son our Lord). No. The contemporary church’s faith isn’t even anchored in the bold exclusivity of Jesus himself who said “I am The Way The Truth and The Life and no one comes to the Father but through me!” America’s new religion isn’t anything this stable this historical this enduring this deep or this true. It is rather a syncretistic amalgamation of Bobby McFerrin and Black Lives Matter sad solipsism of “don’t worry be happy!” as we celebrate the “queering” of all that ails us.



Ms. Bratton concludes: “Moralistic Therapeutic Deism distorts the God of the Bible in an attempt to make him bless all the dissipations and vanities of the modern world.” Mr. Barna adds: “MTD is one of those models that says you gotta live in the moment. This is all you’ve got and you’ve gotta make the most of it.”

“It makes sense” says Ms. Bratton “that ‘Christians’ who embrace MTD are hesitant to [salt] the culture. How can anyone pass judgment if everyone’s just trying to be happy? The only sin is getting in the way of someone’s personal ‘truth.’

“That’s why so many are siding with [neo-Marxist atheistic] groups like Black Lives Matter and the LBGT movement. They’ll listen to the loudest voice on either side. Enter the screaming woke mob; [those who] promote sin under the guise of ‘loving everyone.’”

The Christian apologist Frank Turek recently said “Some people call themselves progressive Christians when they’re neither progressive nor Christian because they disagree with Jesus on several significant issues. They disagree with Jesus on sex. They disagree with Jesus on the Bible. They disagree with Jesus on Heaven and Hell. They disagree with Jesus on his atonement. So why would they call themselves a Christian?”

To paraphrase — Please stop calling yourself a Christian if you don’t believe in Christianity!

“Followers of Christ have forgotten that Jesus didn’t come to tell people to be nice. His message has always been a stumbling block and [this is] especially hard for 21st-century Americans to accept” says Ms. Bratton.

She’s right!

The message of Jesus is one of confession not counseling and comfort and today’s “Christians” would do well to remember that he’s the one who said those ignoring this would be “cast out and trampled underfoot.”

The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the way we look at most things. It has certainly altered the way we look at our city. For many of us our relationship with Lansing has become nostalgic. We have become even more excited to get out and experience what exists in and around this big small town. Whether you’re new in town and just starting your acquaintance or you’ve lived here awhile and are becoming reacquainted we’d like to say “Welcome to Lansing.”

This is part of a series of articles published as a ""Guide to Greater Lansing"" — click here to read more.

Allen Neighborhood Center support local superstars

The Allen Neighborhood Center fulfills many roles for eastside residents: community building health care education jobs and opportunity growth and more. Since it opened in 1999 team members have worked to combat food insecurity health care disparities and lack of opportunity for underserved populations. Today that includes farmers markets (with weekly walk-a-thons to earn free coins to spend at the market) and the kitchen incubator (featuring diverse entrepreneurs such as Smoothie Queen Tantay Peruvian Cuisine and Tatse American African Eats).

Boji Tower from another era entirely

Built by Ransom Eli Olds in 1931 for his expanding business ventures the 250000-square-foot Olds Tower was first renamed the Michigan National Bank Tower in 1954 before becoming Boji Tower in 2005 after the current owners. It's 23 stories feature strongly in the downtown skyline and its giant clock face — 25 feet across about two feet larger than London's Big Ben — draws the eye of those near downtown. The interior is traditional art deco with gold work throughout the lobby and massive elevator doors depicting scenes from the life of R.E. Olds.

Fidelity Lake at Crego Park a perfect picnic spot

One of Lansing's largest parks named for Ralph Crego Lansing's mayor from 1943-61 opened in 2014 following a massive 25-year undertaking to bring it up to snuff. It features Fidelity Lake 15 acres of clear water perfect for fishing kayaking or paddle boarding as well as sidewalks and connections to the Lansing River Trail. The 200-acre park once mired under pollution concerns is a perfect example of the power of a community working together. And it's the perfect spot to take a picnic with family and friends.

Impression 5 Science Center education and fun for all ages

What could be more fun than controlling waterfalls putting together toy trains and interacting with a wall-sized Lite Brite? Bubbles! And they've got this and more at the Impression 5 Science Center. Tucked away on Museum Drive just off Michigan Avenue is a trove of interactive learning you probably haven't visited since your third-grade class went there in 1990-something. It is truly fun and educational for kids of all ages — yes this means you!

Capitol Mall stroll along the Frank Kelley walkway

Many have stood on the Capitol lawn in downtown Lansing — for wedding photos or quick selfies attending protests or community events. Behind the Capitol where few go lies a beautiful walkway leading to the Hall of Justice home to Michigan's Supreme Court. Featuring heated sidewalks for year-round enjoyment as well as accessible ramps and plenty of benches or spots to rest along the way the Frank Kelley walkway — named for the nation's longest-serving state attorney general (1962-1999) — is also home to stunning memorials for Michigan's Vietnam War veterans and fallen law enforcement officers.

Michigan History Center and the amazing state archives

There are advantages to living in the state capital and the Michigan History Center is one of them. From the time of indigenous people all the way to the modern day its collections show what life and times were like here in Michigan during the state's major time periods. Slightly lesser known are the state archives where you will find maps photographs legal documents immigration records historic films and oral history in audio files from many eras including the Civil War Industrial Revolution Motown and more. It's enough to turn anyone into a history buff.

The bill introduced by Sens. Michael Bennet of Colorado and Martin Heinrich of New Mexico would provide about $6.7 billion for a variety of water infrastructure projects the largest amount of additional funding to date to address the longstanding injustice of the lack of clean drinking water in many Indigenous communities across the country.

In a recent report researchers with U.S. Water Alliance and DigDeep found that race is the ""strongest predictor"" of water access and that Native American households are 19 times more likely than white households to lack complete plumbing.

""This is long overdue"" Hopi Tribe Chairman Timothy Nuvangyaoma said in an interview. ""We are First Nations here yet we're the last nations to be really recognized. So it's just an imbalance in equity.""

Many people in Hopi communities have tap water contaminated with toxic arsenic. Some live in homes without running water and must drive to communal wells to fill tanks for bathing and cooking.

The situation is also dire in the Navajo Nation. A report by the House Natural Resources Committee in 2016 cited estimates that 30-40% of people living in the Navajos' 27000-square-mile reservation have no access to running water. Many tribal members use tanks mounted on pickup trucks to haul water often waiting in line to fill up at spigots.

Navajo Nation President Jonathan Nez praised the new legislation calling it ""the first step to ensuring that Native people across the United States have access to clean drinking water.""

""The proposed funding will address a water crisis create jobs and pave the path towards social and racial equity"" Nez said in a statement.

In areas of the Navajo Nation where there are few sources of clean drinking water some people resort to collecting water from windmill-powered wells. The report said water testing showed more than 12% of the unregulated water sources on the reservation exceeded federal drinking water standards for uranium or other radioactive contaminants with some more than 20 times higher than the limit.

Uranium mining on the Navajo Nation in the 1940s and 1950s left behind an estimated 1200 mine sites along with piles of radioactive waste. Some water sources also are tainted with other hazardous contaminants such as bacteria or arsenic.

Waiting for water:On Navajo Nation long lines scarce resources a cry for solutions

Tribes have waited decades for solutions

Efforts by tribal governments to fix and expand inadequate water systems have long been hampered by inadequate funding.

The Tribal Access to Clean Water Act would provide $3.4 billion for the federal Indian Health Service to address needs for water infrastructure projects. This would cover the agency's existing list of projects while also providing an additional amount to enable the agency to scale up its work.

Other funds under the bill would go toward water infrastructure programs overseen by the Environmental Protection Agency the Bureau of Reclamation and the Department of Agriculture.

Heinrich said it's shameful that many Indigenous communities including in New Mexico don't have clean drinking water. Bennet called the situation unacceptable and said the comprehensive legislation would deliver solutions to ""reduce this disparity.""

The 17000 enrolled members of the White Mountain Apache Tribe have for decades coped with water shortages and contaminated water problems.

Chairwoman Gwendena Lee-Gatewood said during an April webinar on water-supply issues that tribal leaders have been trying for about 40 years to bring a new rural water system to fruition.

""Water lines are antiquated. They're from the early 1980s and so we have wells and when certain areas can't have enough water brought to them it adds to the wells running out"" Lee-Gatewood said. ""That's been a challenge for us.""

At times people in parts of the reservation have no water for showers or hand washing Lee-Gatewood said. Some homes don't have any faucets she said and others have water contaminated with manganese that comes out looking gray.

""It creates a serious health and safety hazard especially for our elders"" she said. ""The data clearly shows that those homes without potable water continue to suffer from infectious diseases and especially during COVID-19.""

Legislation that passed in 2010 quantified the tribe's water rights and authorized funding to address these water challenges Lee-Gatewood said.

""It's going to provide safe dependable secure good-quality water supply for our communities"" Lee-Gatewood said. ""But it's years away from completion. And unfortunately this pandemic has slowed the work of the rural water system. But the tribe we're moving forward as expeditiously as possible.""

The Inter Tribal Association of Arizona which represents the interests of 21 of the 22 tribes in the state wrote to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell in June in support of funding clean water and wastewater infrastructure in Indian Country.

""The need for reliable water and wastewater infrastructure has never been more apparent than during the COVID-19 pandemic that disproportionately impacted Indian Country"" wrote Maria Dadgar executive director of the association. ""In Arizona the pandemic dealt a devastating blow to our Tribal communities including the loss of Tribal members employees and family members. By all accounts the pandemic has had an even more disproportionate impact on Tribal communities due to inadequate access to clean drinking water and the aging infrastructure that supports water and wastewater systems on Tribal lands.""

The association's sister organization the Inter Tribal Council of Arizona has provided technical support to tribes across the United States on drinking water and wastewater systems for more than 40 years wrote Dadgar an enrolled member of the Piscataway Tribe of Accokeek Maryland. ""This work has given the Inter Tribal Council's subject matter experts keen insight into the infrastructure needs throughout Indian Country and it is clear that critical investments are required.""

Dadgar said that investing in water infrastructure is critical to ensuring the lives and safety of Native American people today and in the future.

Although the CARES Act allowed tribes to use part of the relief funding to build or repair infrastructure huge gaps remain.

Supporters of the legislation cite estimates that 48% of homes on Native American reservations don't have access to clean drinking water reliable water sources or adequate sanitation.

The Indian Health Service has a $3.1 billion backlog of needed projects awaiting funding nationwide.

Calls for a 'whole of government' approach

""It's a dire need and it exists all over the country"" said Anne Castle co-leader of an initiative on Universal Access to Clean Water for Tribal Communities. ""It's a problem that has existed for decades but it has been too frequently ignored.""

Although other legislation under discussion in Congress also would bring significant funding for clean water infrastructure the details haven't been working out Castle said. She pointed out that these other bills don't focus on the multiple agencies that address tribal water infrastructure the way the Bennet-Heinrich bill does.

The initiative on water access was started by the Colorado River Basin Water & Tribes Initiative which Castle also helps advise.

Daryl Vigil co-facilitator of the Water & Tribes Initiative said the new legislation had its roots in the work of two groups: the Ten Tribes Partnership a consortium of the tribes that border the Colorado River and the tribal initiative which includes the other 19 tribes whose lands lie within the Colorado River Basin.

""We recognized that there was a momentum being built already with the Ten Tribes Partnership and through a tribal water study"" which was written in 2019 said Vigil a member of the Jicarilla Apache Nation.

Leaders of tribes in the West have also been working to collaborate with government entities on water issues and have sought to have their voices included in discussions about managing the Colorado River which has been depleted by severe drought overuse and the effects of climate change.

Castle said addressing the lack of clean drinking water in tribal nations is ""an issue that connects all of the primary priorities of the Biden administration on COVID recovery and economic recovery and racial equity and climate change.""

The goal through the legislation Castle said is to capitalize on that focus on infrastructure and racial equity ""to implement solutions real progress on the ground.""

Castle is a senior fellow at the University of Colorado Law School's Getches-Wilkinson Center for Natural Resources Energy and the Environment. She previously worked as the Interior Department's assistant secretary for water and science during the Obama administration.

She noted that the federal government has a special trust responsibility to Indian tribes.

""The promise was made that the tribal lands would be a permanent livable homeland and you don't have a livable homeland if you don't have clean running water"" Castle said.

""We have an opportunity right now to correct this problem"" Castle said. ""And I'm concerned that if we don't take the opportunity now this is a once-in-a-generation chance and it may not come around again for a very long time.""

Solutions will depend on the circumstances of each community and may involve drilling new wells building treatment systems or running pipes to homes Castle said all of which will require coordination among federal agencies.

""That's why our group is advocating for a 'whole of government' approach"" Castle said referring to the initiative's recommendations in a recent report. She said the proposed funding wouldn't completely solve the water problems everywhere in tribal communities but it would go a long way.

It's the largest amount of money targeted for tribal clean water infrastructure Castle said. ""And it would address a very significant part of the problem. As a country we've not focused on ensuring that Native American communities enjoy the same basic services as white communities do.""

The needs for basic water infrastructure on Native American lands go beyond the list of projects that federal officials have identified.

On the Navajo Nation for example a reservation-wide plan for building water infrastructure includes a list of projects that according to Rex Kontz of the Navajo Tribal Utility Authority would cost an estimated $4.5 billion to complete.

Some tribal leaders have voiced concerns that while the crisis of lead-contaminated water in Flint Michigan garnered national attention their communities' severe and longstanding water contamination problems have received much less attention.

""It's taken a national pandemic to expose the drinking water crisis in Indian Country but we will keep fighting to secure a clean and reliable water supply for our members"" Lee-Gatewood said. ""We're in 2021 now and we still have people hauling water. And it shouldn't be that way.""

Arizona legislators support more funding

Sen. Mark Kelly D-Ariz. said he supports the legislation.

""It's been my priority in the Senate to upgrade and expand tribal drinking water infrastructure to ensure tribal communities across Arizona have access to clean reliable water"" Kelly said in a statement.

Kelly serves on a bipartisan water infrastructure working group which a spokesperson said advances some of the Bennet and Heinrich bill’s priorities as well as other projects.

Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema said in an emailed statement that the federal government ""must continue investing in tribal water programs to guarantee access to safe and clean running water provide adequate sanitation to stop the spread of COVID-19 and build stronger more durable water systems that will help expand economic opportunities for Native American communities.""

Sinema added that she recently secured $250 million to fund 10 tribal water projects in Arizona each year through the reauthorization of the Indian Reservation Drinking Water Program.

A spokesperson for Sinema a Democrat said that she co-sponsored legislation to increase funding for the Indian Health Service's facilities construction fund by $3 billion and she supports legislation to provide another $1.8 billion to other programs. Sinema's spokesperson said she is reviewing the new bill.

'We need water to survive':Hopi Tribe pushes for solutions in long struggle for water

Nuvangyaoma and other Hopi leaders have been appealing to federal officials for years for more funding to address the glaring deficiencies in water systems. With the Biden administration focusing on the need for infrastructure Nuvangyaoma said he's hopeful that legislators will support the bill.

""It's time"" he said ""the nation invests in its very first peoples.""

Six Hopi villages have water contaminated with levels of arsenic exceeding the federal drinking water standard Nuvangyaoma said. In some areas tests have shown arsenic levels as much as three to four times over the federal standard putting those who drink the water at higher risk of cancer kidney disease diabetes and other illnesses.

The tribal government has secured $20.5 million in federal funds for a water project called the Hopi Arsenic Mitigation Project which is to include a 41-mile pipeline storage tanks and other infrastructure that will bring clean water to homes. Under the plan the system will supply water to 869 homes in the areas of First Mesa and Second Mesa including 778 households that have tap water contaminated with arsenic.

Nuvangyaoma said workers have been out with equipment laying pipelines. But he said other infrastructure needs remain to bring clean drinking water to the Hopi and he thinks the bill would provide important new funding.

The bill is more comprehensive than other previous proposals and ""takes some of the guesswork out of where some of these monies are being allocated to"" Nuvangyaoma said.

Some researchers have likened the deficient water infrastructure on the Hopi Reservation to that of developing countries such as Pakistan and India.

About 40 years ago the Indian Health Service installed water pipes in the village of Mishongnovi where Nuvangyaoma grew up. But since then he said ""I haven't seen any real improvements to that water infrastructure.""

The pressing needs for basic water infrastructure on Hopi lands and other Native communities nationwide he said ""have just been overlooked for too long.""

We’re off and running! Well no track yet. But we’re shooting weightlifting and playing handball.

The Olympics began two days ago but the Opening Ceremony makes it official. Many in the U.S. watched it live in the morning others watched it on tape delay in the evening. Our Michael Rosenberg watched it from inside the stadium and wrote this: “Absent context this was a gorgeous evening but context does matter. … The Tokyo 2020 Organizing Committee put on a beautiful but doomed show.”

His points are valid and I’ve written about conflicted feelings too. But there were some things to like in the ceremony.

Like human pictograms!

And a very good pianist. And some great outfits. But enough with “Imagine” already.

Let’s move on to the sports.

While You Were Sleeping

Water polo

The highlight of the night for Team USA was the women’s water polo team’s absolute domination of Japan. For those who don’t know this is one of the U.S.’s best teams in Tokyo. In addition to winning gold in London and Rio the team has streaks of world titles in non-Olympic years.

Japan kept things tight early evening the score at 3–3. The U.S. then finished on a 22–1 run to win by a final of 25–4.

According to USA Water Polo’s Twitter account the team set Olympic records for goals in a game (25) margin of victory (21) and halftime score (14). Captain Maggie Steffens scored five goals and was one of four players to score at least four.

The box score tells the story. They have more than enough good players and share the ball around very unselfishly. Not every game will look like this but they are primed to go on another deep run.

Softball

Team USA ran its softball record to 3–0 with a 2–0 win over Mexico. Cat Osterman once again took the mound and once again didn’t allow any runs. (Team USA still hasn’t allowed anyone to cross home with three shutout wins by a combined score of 5–0.) After Osterman went six innings Monica Abbott—who threw a one-hitter in Game 2—came in to close the seventh. The leadoff batter reached base on an error bringing the tying run to the plate. Then she struck out the side to end things.

The team has not been clobbering opponents with laughable scores like it did the last time softball was an Olympic sport in 2008. That year it won all seven of its games by a combined score of 53–1. But the pitching has been spotless and the offense has done enough for now.

First medal

The first gold of Tokyo was awarded in the women’s 10m air rifle. I can’t say with any certainty that I’ve ever watched this sport before and I’m not sure I would have had it not owned this distinction. But it made for a compelling watch with eight competitors in the finals getting knocked out one at a time until the final winner was crowned. Team USA’s Mary Carolynn Tucker came in sixth. China’s Yang Qian won the first gold.

Remember that athletes will be putting medals around their own necks throughout these Olympics because of COVID. I am not allowed to tweet videos but I shared some screenshots.

3x3 basketball

The first 3x3 game in Team USA Olympic history tipped off a little before 5 a.m. ET Saturday morning and the team comfortably handled France 17–10. My first impression (I caught some of the China-Serbia men’s game earlier in the night) was just how intimate the venue looked. The seats are practically on top of the court. If fans were there I’d expect the players to hear just about every word said to them—though it was quickly pointed out to me on Twitter that the constant music does help negate that.

I know 3x3 has grown in popularity the last few years (that is of course how it got in the Olympics) but I haven’t watched as much of the non-Olympic action as other basketball obsessives have. I can see the appeal. It moves very quickly. An offensive player can scoop the ball up after a made bucket fire it out beyond the arc to start the next possession and get the ball right back. The half-court game also allows for a different camera angle than most full-court games. It still feels a little odd to see it in the Olympics but it’s fun and I’m giving it a chance.

Archery and fencing losses

It was not all good news for Team USA on Day 1. Brady Ellison and Mackenzie Brown the No. 2 seed in the new mixed team archery event were upset by the No. 15 seed from Indonesia. They lost the first two sets then won the next two to force a shootout in which all four archers shot just one arrow. They lost it going down in an upset. Ellison is a three-time Olympic medalist and a 2019 world champion but is still looking for his first Olympic gold. He did not take advantage of his new chance.

In fencing 2016 silver medalist Daryl Homer lost his first bout. Eli Dershwitz won his first then lost his second. If you’ve never watched fencing before be prepared for a lot of shouting.

Quadrathlon

Last week my colleague Dan Gartland and I drafted teams in five sports the U.S. didn’t qualify for. Even though my team is reeling from Argentina’s stunning loss to Australia in men’s soccer it was nice to have a rooting interest last night in handball and on the gorgeous blue turf of the field hockey complex.

You are welcome to adopt my team’s (or Dan’s) and follow along in this Google Doc. We’re tied 2–2 thanks to Norway’s come-from-behind win over Brazil in men’s handball and Australia’s come-from-behind win over Japan in men’s field hockey. They had me sweating but it was fun to have something on the line.

Rowing sailing and surfing are all slated to take place Saturday night but I’d keep an eye on schedules do to a typhoon in the forecast.

SI’s Best

• Again here’s Michael Rosenberg writing from the Opening Ceremony.

Rivera disappeared while boating with her son Josey at Lake Piru California last July. When the 4-year-old was found alone on the boat Rivera had rented a massive search party was sent out with Rivera’s body discovered floating in the lake five days later. Authorities told the media they did not suspect foul play and her official cause of death was ruled as an accidental drowning. She was 33.

In his tribute the proud father tells Rivera that their little boy is growing up to be “inquisitive” “sweet” and “funny” and that although he misses her he “knows he’ll see you again.”

In his tribute the proud father posted photos of Josey as baby with his mom and another giving a thumbs up for the camera. In the lengthy caption Dorsey tells Rivera that their little boy is growing up to be “inquisitive” “sweet” and “funny” and that although he misses her he “knows he’ll see you again.”

You can read the message in full below:

“A year ago we laid you to rest. I still can’t believe it. The year has flown by so fast that it doesn’t seem like it’s been a year at all. Our boy has grown so much. He’s such an explorer so inquisitive. He’s sweet so funny and his laugh always lights up the room. He’s an intuitive soul to say the least. To know him is to love him everyone that meets him is always smiling. He’s doing ok. He’s such a resilient strong kid. He misses you but knows he’ll see you again and the invisible string is something that’s helped us out during this ever-evolving transition of your time with us on earth that was unfairly & for reasons we’ll never understand cut short…too soon…



July will probably always be a strange and difficult month in the years that are hopefully plentiful in the future…still hard to see photos still haven’t been able to read or watch anything…as the years go by strength will be on my side as I will share the memories with what is the brightest star of your legacy left on this earth our beautiful son Josey.



The thumbs up…only a eemed [sic] right. I remember the first time he did it back to you. At jujitsu you gave him a thumbs up and he returned the gesture…it was so sweet. Maybe it’s silly and doesn’t make sense to be doing this on IG and putting this out there but so is this whole thing. So there’s that…



Fly high Rest In Peace knowing he’s doing ? ok…he’s being raised right and he’s got a lot of family and people around him that love him and you. ????



For everyone out there that’s gone through similar events of loss…you know there’s not really any words that make it better…we know some days are better than others…but know our hearts and energy are with you. We keep going because that’s all we can do while being as strong as we can be.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Done right the sci-fi story based on Isaac Asimov’s novels could become an amazing show. It could rival fantasy shows like Game of Thrones. But Foundation isn’t easy to adapt for the big or little screen. Addressing the new Apple TV + show Foundation head writer and showrunner David Goyer explained how he’s making it work. He also revealed the one-sentence pitch that helped him sell Foundation to Apple.

Goyer whose work includes the Blade trilogy The Dark Knight trilogy and Man of Steel has two massive shows debuting in the coming months. Foundation launches on Apple TV + on September 24th while The Sandman is expected to hit Netflix in 2022.

The former is the more daring of the two with Goyer having told The Hollywood Reporter that he wants Foundation to be an epic 80-hour TV series. That’s eight seasons of 10 episodes each “if it works out.” The showrunner said the story he wants to tell with Foundation would be a trilogy of about nine hours if he were to do it as features.

The one-sentence Foundation pitch for Apple TV

Apple asked Goyer “laughingly” to pitch Foundation for Apple TV in a single sentence. Here’s what he told them: “It’s a 1000-year chess game between Hari Seldon [Jared Harris] and the Empire and all the characters in between are the pawns but some of the pawns over the course of this saga end up becoming kings and queens.”

Apple is going big on Foundation. According to the same Goyer that Foundation “takes some big-ass swings” and Apple “by and large went for it.”

Goyer also recalled talking about the Foundation project to Apple TV + chiefs Jamie Erlicht and Zack Van Amburg. “Don’t note me on the science-fiction. I can handle the science fiction. Note me on the drama note me on the characters note me on their relationships. I’ll take care of the other crap” he had told them.

Apple has offered Goyer the resources he needed to make Foundation season one for Apple TV +. He said the show has an ample budget. “On an average per hour if you were to take two episodes and put them together the budget is bigger than some of the movies I’ve done.”

Why Foundation is so complicated

Whether you’ve read Asimov’s Foundation books or not Goyer explained to THR why it’s so difficult to adapt in movies or TV shows:

There are three tricky aspects to Foundation that I think have tripped up all the other adaptations. The first is that the story is supposed to span 1000 years with all these massive time jumps — that’s hard to tell. It’s certainly hard to capsulize in a two- or three-hour film. The second aspect is the books are kind of anthological. You’ll have a couple of short stories in the first book with main character Salvor Hardin then you’ll jump forward a hundred years and there’ll be a different character. The third thing is that they’re not particularly emotional; they’re books about ideas about concepts. So a lot of the action happens off-screen. In the books the Empire which is on 10000 worlds literally falls off-screen — like it happens in between chapters. Obviously that wasn’t going to work for a television show.

Without spoiling anything that we’re about to see on Apple TV + Goyer said he found a way to make Foundation interesting for streaming:

Tech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox. Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there. Email: SIGN UP By signing up I agree to the Terms of Use and have reviewed the Privacy Notice.

So without giving too much away I figured out a way to have some of the characters extend their lifespans. About six characters will continue from season to season from century to century. That way it becomes a half anthological half continuing story.

The show based on the books that inspired George Lucas for Star Wars launches on September 24th — check out the latest trailer below.

But those jobs were scarce amid airline layoffs in the early 1990s. In the three decades since he traded commodities invested in energy equipment and created an organic distillery.

That latest business — Maple Plain-based Drake's Organic Spirits — is one of the Minnesota companies that has raised a sizable amount of venture capital this year.

Last month Drake's Organic closed a third private placement of stock at $7 million following two earlier raises that provided $11.4 million. At the moment investors give the company an implied value of $70 million.

""I just want to focus on the work"" Mark Anderson said. ""Our goal was to build something new and we're doing it. We've doubled sales every year since 2017.""

Drake's distilled 12 times is a premium brand that prices competitively at $20 or $21 per bottle thanks to little overhead and supply-chain control.

Anderson expects profitable sales this year of up to $20 million. Anderson and his wife Kristen remain the single-largest shareholders.

For Mark Anderson who is 51 the success is the climax of a career with several twists.

He got into commodity trading after he saw the 1980s movie ""Trading Places"" thinking the business would make him successful enough to own an airplane.

""In 'Trading Places' with commodity trading they were kind of farming on paper"" Anderson recalled of the comedy. ""I decided to do some research.""

Anderson eventually opened an account with a clearing firm made a deposit of $4000 borrowed on a credit card and leased a seat on the Minneapolis Grain Exchange for $15 a month.

""I walked into the pit got badge No. 357 and I was an independent trader"" Anderson recalled. ""Hard spring red wheat contracts. I figured out how markets were made and moved and the dynamics of market makers. When the Archer-Daniels-Midland's broker's phone rang we knew he would be a seller. And when the General Mills broker's phone rang he would be a buyer.

""I had some great days and made lots of money. But you also lose 90% of the time. So you have to be good enough to do much better on your winners.""

In 1998 he took a position with North Central Cos. buying and selling physical commodities such as dairy powders cheese and grain. He started a company called Killer Whale leveraging with derivatives that helped him control a significant portion of the dairy markets from 2000 to 2004. He retired that year a multimillionaire.

Mark and Kristen whom he met at UND live on a 29-acre horse ranch in Maple Plain. They own former race horses and other animals rescued through Kristen's nonprofit Long Lake Animal Rescue.

Mark Anderson also made money investing in pipe manufacturers serving the North Dakota energy boom in the mid-2000s. He says he missed a huge win by not directly investing in the industry during the 2008-09 collapse when valuations hit bottom.

""Anybody who only tells you about the wins is probably full of B.S."" he said. ""I've had my misses. And I'm grateful for my wife our kids and our success. We started out broke. I'm also wealthy in everything money can't buy.""

Kristen Anderson has a passion for healthy lifestyles that combined with Mark Anderson's penchant for researching and understanding markets and led them after careful study to launch Drake's Organic Spirits.

Earlier they had launched Captain Drake's — a provider of organic ingredients such as citric acid and organic cane sugar to the food and beverage industry.

Mark Anderson said Drake's Organic is the only spirits company to achieve five certifications: vegan gluten-free non-GMO kosher and USDA organic.

And the Andersons who raised two college-age daughters have hired New York investment banker Cohen & Co. to field inquiries from larger alcoholic beverage companies interesting in how they've exploited the organic niche successfully.

They eschewed grain-based alcohol and sourced cane sugar from the Cauca Valley of Colombia where the organic alcohol is distilled. No herbicides or pesticides.

Anderson doesn't drink alcohol. His wife and others are the tasters. ""I choose to be clear-headed at all times"" he said.

Anderson who has focused on sourcing ingredients markets and the growing health movement built a lean company of only 12 people. The firm leverages capital and expertise by using contractors to distill bottle and package products including the fast-growing ""boxtail"" line of Drake's drinks.

Drake's distributes nationally through Southern Glazer's Wine and Spirits.

""We control our own supply chain for organic alcohol"" Anderson said. ""In 2020 we sold 40000 cases. This year we forecast 200000 cases. We have capacity for 12 million cases.''

Bill Hawks a 20-year business partner and friend of Anderson's called him ""a humble guy who looks like a movie star. He attracts people. And he's a good guy who does a lot of business stuff really well. He has the vision … and then put all the parts together.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vZm9vZGluc3RpdHV0ZS5jb20vZm9jdXMvdGhlLWltcGxpY2F0aW9ucy1vZi1oaWdoZXItaW5mbGF0aW9uLWFuZC1jb3ZpZC0xOS1pbmZlY3Rpb24tcmF0ZXMtZm9yLXRoZS1mb29kLWluZHVzdHJ5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Implications of Higher Inflation and COVID-19 Infection Rates for the Food Industry,"Here are trending economic and food industry data points as well as major economic and company earnings releases for the coming week: higher inflation and COVID-19 infection rates public health policy changes vaccine passport the implications for the food industry and more

The implications of higher inflation and COVID-19 infection rates for the food industry

A recent Food Institute study found that among G20 economies countries with higher COVID-19 infection rates are experiencing higher inflation. With that what are the implications for the food industry? Let’s take a closer look.

Higher inflation and COVID-19 infection rates

The Federal Reserve acknowledged that inflation has increased “notably” and COVID-19 still poses risks to the recovery. At the center of the current inflation debate is the question of when will the pandemic be contained to the degree that the economy can return to “normalcy.” Waves of the pandemic especially the surging Delta variant created uncertainties for the economy. And these uncertainties exacerbated the mismatch between supply and demand which in turn sparked inflation growth.

In The Food Institute study we found that among G20 economies countries that have been more affected by the pandemic are experiencing higher rates of inflation. In the initial study we divided the countries into two groups by the number of COVID-19 cases as well as the infection rate (number of COVID-19 cases / number of tests). Then computed the average inflation rate for each group based on each country’s latest CPI or similar measure. In further analysis we excluded outliers (countries that had extremely high or low inflation prior to the pandemic). In other words their high/low rate of inflation is not necessarily a result of the pandemic.

After excluding outliers the first group (high COVID-19 cases) had an average inflation rate of 5.31% and the second group (low cases) had an average inflation rate of 1.68%. In other words consumer price increases among high-infection countries were more than triple those of low-infection countries. Moreover when compared to 2019 (i.e. pre-pandemic) the first group experienced an increase in inflation by 1.52% while the second group experienced a decrease in inflation by 0.28%.

Public health policy changes and implications for the food industry

The recent surge of Delta variant cases suggests that the U.S. has entered a fourth wave of the pandemic. Pending FDA’s full approval businesses and government agencies will likely require vaccinations for their employees and customers.

In the U.K. the government will launch daily COVID testing of food sector workers to tackle its ‘pingdemic.”

In France the government requires “vaccine passport” for anyone who wants to enter a theater museum theme park cultural center shopping mall train bus restaurant bar or cafe.

In China the government partnered with McDonald’s to offer free ice cream to boost its vaccination efforts.

A number of food-related companies are stepping up ahead of government mandates:

ALDI Chobani Darden Restaurants McDonald’s Starbucks Target and Trader Joe’s are providing paid time off for vaccinations.

Amazon Lidl Bolthouse Farms Instacart JBS USA Pilgrim’s and Kroger are giving employees cash bonuses to get vaccinated.

Amazon is also providing on-site vaccination for its U.S. front-line employees. Bolthouse Farms and Houston’s Legacy Restaurants hosted vaccine “pop-ups.”

Michelin-starred restaurant Eleven Madison Park requires all workers to be vaccinated.

Safety and Mobility are keys to return to normalcy

In a recent update of the “Anticipated Vaccine Adoption & Impact on the CPG Industry” report IRI pointed out that consumers’ willingness to restore normal work and shopping patterns will depend on vaccine adoption. Understanding the evolution of social mobility is key to assess demand and supply in the foreseeable future. In the framework of a “new normal” IRI’s current forecast of resuming “normal” mobility is summer 2022.

Projecting future inflation is a more difficult task. “I think trying to predict where inflation is going to be in a few years is a mug’s game” said Kristin Forbes an economist at M.I.T. and a former official at the United States Treasury and the Bank of England. “Policymakers need to be ready for different scenarios…If things recover faster than expected we know how to deal with that. If things don’t recover that’s a harder situation.” The longer and to a greater degree that the pandemic can’t be contained the more challenging it will be for both consumers and businesses.

Last Thursday (22 July 2021) Kim attended the listening party for Kanye's new album Donda (named after his late mother Donda West) alongside sister Khloé Kardashian family friend Jonathan Cheban and all four of her and Kanye's children; North Saint Chicago and Psalm.

Kanye paired a bright-red tank top and trousers with a red version of his Yeezy Gap Round Jacket which has only been released in blue and black so far. He also wore a ski mask covering the entirety of his face. According to Page Six the look references an all-red outfit worn by Shotaro Kaneda in the Japanese movie Akira.

You can see the look captured by Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for Universal Music Group below.

Kim also opted for a crimson look wearing (according to Page Six) a skintight leather jumpsuit by Rick Owens costing approximately $3690. For maximum impact she finished off the look with a pair of sparkly-heeled platforms in red naturally.

Jonathan Cheban shared a snap of the look on Instagram with the caption ""Too bright in here ⭐️"" which we're guessing is a reference to their dramatic sunglasses game.

This comes after fans praised Kim's style following her split from Kayne saying ""The old Kim is back"" in response to Kim posting some *extremely* glamorous snaps from her vacation earlier this month. This included a series of photos of herself wearing a 90s vintage Dolce & Gabbana tortoise shell dress captioned: ""Tortoise Shell at the Trevi.""

Dans le cadre du plan ""France Relance"" la société dirigée par Régis Déjean depuis 1993 percevra une subvention de 820 000 € soit plus d’un tiers d’un projet de modernisation d’un montant total de plus de 2 M€. Le sous-préfet de Castres François Proisy ainsi que le député de la 3e circonscription du Tarn Jean Terlier ont participé à la remise d’un panneau France Relance pour ce projet qui s’articulera autour de trois axes. Le premier la prise en compte du bien-être animal en assurant un abattage sans douleur aux animaux : ""On veut mettre en place une chaîne adaptée au gabarit des porcelets mais aussi améliorer le système d’abattage des ovins en investissant dans une anesthésie en trois points comme celle que l’on a mis en place pour les porcs en 2018 et qui permet de ne pas faire souffrir les bêtes.""

Le deuxième axe quant à lui porte sur une amélioration des conditions de travail des salariés. Au programme une dépénibilisation des postes la mise en place de formations en affûtage et en qualité hygiène et enfin la création de deux postes pour pouvoir augmenter les cadences en cas de besoin. Enfin le plan de rénovation vise à accroître la compétitivité de l’abattoir en réaménagement et en agrandissant l’atelier de découpe afin de répondre à la demande croissante. ""L’idée du projet c’est de pouvoir pérenniser la suite. On sait qu’il faut investir mais il faut prendre la bonne route"" insiste Régis Déjean lui qui a pris la tête de l’entreprise alors qu’elle était au bord du gouffre.

Un projet pile dans les plans du gouvernement

Le projet de rénovation a séduit les instances à commencer par François Proisy : ""Les trois thèmes correspondent au cœur de cible du plan de relance des abattoirs. Cela correspond point par point aux préoccupations du gouvernement quant à l’évolution des abattoirs et c’est ce qui nous a plu dans ce projet. Sans cet outil qui se modernise tous les 2-3 ans le produit n’existe pas. Un abattoir ça va bien au-delà du fait d’abattre les animaux. C’est un équipement local au plus près des éleveurs et des consommateurs. C’est un outil indispensable qui doit être préservé."" Et grâce aux 820 000 € financés par l’Etat l’abattoir de Puylaurens va pouvoir poursuivre son expansion plus sereinement.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL2xhbGlicmV2aWxsZS5jb20vbGUtY2FsaWZvcm5pZW4tZGV2ZW51LWNlbGVicmUtcG91ci1zZXRyZS1tb3F1ZS1kdS12YWNjaW4tc3VyLWxlcy1yZXNlYXV4LXNvY2lhdXgtZXN0LW1vcnQtZGUtbGEtY292aWQtMTkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Le Californien devenu célèbre pour s'être moqué du vaccin sur les réseaux sociaux est mort de la Covid-19,"L’homme était traité depuis plusieurs mois pour une pneumonie et une infection au Covid-19 dans un hôpital situé dans la grande banlieue de Los Angeles où il est décédé ce mercredi.

Pourquoi les fêtes patronales  les bandas  les arènes ?...Tout cet été  Marie Pendanx nous explique les Landes festives sur France Bleu Gascogne

Comme le basket ou le rugby la musique occupe ici une place particulière de sorte que la place qu’y prend la musique populaire étonne celles et ceux qui viennent d’autres régions. Effectivement on remarque dans notre département une forte pratique de la musique : qui n’a pas dans sa famille au moins un de ses membres qui fait partie d’une association musicale où il joue d’un instrument ! Il s’agit d’une pratique populaire collective et très souvent intergénérationnelle comme en témoignent les harmonies et bandas assurant l’animation musicale de la vie locale.

Comment expliquer cette forte pratique de la musique dans les Landes ?

Apprendre la musique ça faisait partie de la culture locale. Il existait un terreau. Ce terreau commence avec les gens qui faisaient le bal le dimanche puis les harmonies (musique militaire) les patronages et enfin la banda. Rappelons l’existence ici d’une tradition musicale celle des cliques liées aux patronages. D’ailleurs souvent constituées de toutes pièces les bandas ont pu parfois succéder à une clique ou à une harmonie voire coexister avec une harmonie au sein d’une même société de musique.

Très souvent il existe une même association type société musicale fédérant l’école de musique l’harmonie et la banda comme à Pouillon. Les jeunes musiciens apprennent à jouer d’un instrument au sein de l’école de musique pour intégrer l’harmonie où ils répètent durant la saison « morte » (automne-hiver) et ensuite rejoindre les rangs de la banda de la commune (« Los Campesinos ») pour les sorties festives estivales.

Les musiciens sont-ils rémunérés quand ils jouent ?

Cette pratique de la musique se réalise donc dans des collectifs musicaux au sein d’associations. Les musiciens viennent jouer bénévolement pour le plaisir de sorte que « on demande plus au musicien son état d’esprit que son niveau musical ». Cet état d’esprit encouragé par l’association participe de la dynamique du groupe et des valeurs défendues par celui-ci (convivialité entraide solidarité …). La musique est ainsi au cœur de la vie locale comme dans le canton de Pouillon animé été comme hiver grâce aux interventions et performances de son école de musique de son harmonie et de sa banda « Los Campesinos ».

D’ailleurs il n’y a qu’à voir l’importance des bandas dans les Landes !

Ces groupes de musiciens mobiles qui jouent de la musique dans les rues en fête s’inspirent de la culture espagnole tout en restant fidèles à leurs racines rurales partagent les valeurs issues de ce monde rural : entraide partage convivialité … entre membres et adeptes. Les bandas demeurent des groupes fortement ancrés dans un village ou dans un petit ensemble de communes voisines.

Trump told a group of oil executives and lobbyists gathered at a dinner at his Mar-a-Lago resort last month that they should donate $1 billion to his presidential campaign because if elected he would roll back environmental rules that he said hampered their industry according to two people who were there.

About 20 people attended an April 11 event billed as an “energy round table” at Mr. Trump’s private club according to those people who asked not to be identified in order to discuss the private event. Attendees included executives from ExxonMobil EQT Corporation and the American Petroleum Institute which lobbies for the oil industry.

The event was organized by the oil billionaire Harold Hamm who has for years helped to shape Republican energy policies. It was first reported by The Washington Post.

Mr. Trump has publicly railed for months against President Biden’s energy and environmental agenda as Mr. Biden has raced to restore and strengthen dozens of climate and conservation rules that Mr. Trump had weakened or erased while in office.

(1:19)

Open Extended Reactions

The Indiana Pacers have submitted 78 instances of incorrect or non-calls to the NBA that they felt put them at a disadvantage in Games 1 and 2 against the New York Knicks a league source told ESPN.

Pacers coach Rick Carlisle speaking after Indiana fell behind 2-0 in the Eastern Conference semifinals with a 130-121 loss to New York on Wednesday said the team had identified 29 questionable refereeing decisions from Game 1. The source said the Pacers then identified 49 plays from Game 2 that they felt were incorrectly called or not called at all and submitted them overnight to the NBA office.

Carlisle said they had decided not to send the Game 1 calls to the league office for review but reversed that decision after Game 2 had similar officiating issues from their perspective.

As part of NBA protocol the clips will also be shared with the Knicks.

""I can promise you that we're going to submit these tonight"" Carlisle said after being ejected in the final minute when he was given two technical fouls. ""New York can get ready. They'll see 'em too. I'm always talking to our guys about not making it about the officials but we deserve a fair shot.""

A frustrated Carlisle also implied the Pacers were being penalized by officials because they were playing against the league's largest market.

""Small-market teams deserve an equal shot"" Carlisle said. ""They deserve a fair shot no matter where they're playing.""

Carlisle was ejected after growing upset about several calls in Game 2 particularly when officials correctly reversed a double-dribble violation that could have given the Pacers a key possession with the outcome still in doubt.

In Game 1 a kicked ball violation was called in error against the Pacers but not corrected a decision that ended up costing the team three vital points during the 121-117 loss.

The Madison Square Garden crowd which was elated when star Jalen Brunson returned in the second half after missing the entire second quarter to deal with a right foot issue made the environment hostile for the Pacers and Carlisle said he believed it affected the officiating to favor the Knicks.

The Pacers will have to examine their defensive film as well. After allowing the Knicks to shoot 65% in the second half in Game 1 as they lost a lead New York shot 67% in the third quarter of Game 2 and flipped the game outscoring Indiana 36-18 behind Brunson's return.

Pacers star Tyrese Haliburton who scored 34 points in bouncing back from putting up six in Game 1 wasn't going to put all the blame on the officiating.

""Let's not pretend like [officiating] is the only reason we lost. We just didn't play good enough"" Haliburton said. ""We just got to be better.""

One other issue for the Pacers to review as the series moves to Indianapolis for Game 3 on Friday (7 p.m. ET ESPN) is how to guard Brunson. Backup guard T.J. McConnell was somewhat effective in slowing Brunson in Games 1 and 2 but Carlisle took him out with seven minutes to play and the Knicks up two points replacing him with starter Andrew Nembhard.

Brunson scored 10 of his 29 points down the stretch with Nembhard as his primary defender and is 14-of-21 shooting for 33 points against Nembhard over the first two games according to ESPN Stats & Information. Carlisle said he considered bringing McConnell who had a +10 plus/minus on the night back in but decided against it because it wasn't how the team has played throughout the season.

McConnell supported his coach's decision.

""Rick is a Hall of Fame coach and has been doing this for a long time so the rotations that he plays we trust that they're the right ones and I fully support him"" McConnell said. ""Whenever my number is called I'll be ready.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS9uZXdzL2NyaXRpY3MtZmFjZXBhbG0tYm90aC1oYW5kcy10cnVtcHMtMDY1MjE5NTc0Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Critics Facepalm With Both Hands At Trump's Nonsensical 'Ambidextrous' Talk,"Former President Donald Trump seemingly needed a hand or two with the definition of “ambidextrous” during an interview that aired Thursday on Telemundo 51.

Trump following a question about separating his legal issues amid family time said he’s able to “put it aside” before inaccurately referring to the ability to be equally skillful with both hands.

“I’m very ambidextrous so to speak I can do a lot of things at one time” Trump said.

“And I’m willing to do and able to do things and lots of different things.”

President Joe Biden’s reelection campaign later used the clip to mock the “confused” former president on X.

Leo Lukenas III a former Green Beret who was part of the bank’s Financial Institutions Group died of “acute coronary artery thrombus” at age 35 last Thursday according to a Reuters report.

He leaves behind a wife and two young children.

His death came after he had allegedly been working some 100 hours a week for several weeks in a row on a $2 billion merger that was completed last Monday — three days before his tragic death.

Much of the outcry on social media site Reddit from purported bank staffers has been directed at Lukenas’ boss Gary Howe co-head of the financial institutions group. Howe took down his LinkedIn page during the last few days.

Some employees have reportedly messaged each other about a possible walkout in an effort to bargain for better working conditions according to popular financial website and chat board Wall Street Oasis.

One post from an anonymous banker highlighted a list of demands for employees’ welfare that generated more than 450 comments in response.

The demands include “proactive policies” that cap work schedules at an average of 80 hours over a seven-day period and that employees get at least one weekend off per month. It also called for an investigation into Lukenas’ death.

So far workers have remained at their desks — in part because they fear retribution for raising concerns about the toxic culture sources said.

A Bank of America spokesperson did not comment about a possible walkout or the accusations of retribution when reached by The Post.

The rep said the bank has no plans to take any action against Howe or to investigate complaints that its junior bankers are forced to put in 100-hour weeks.

“We are very saddened by the loss of our teammate. We continue to focus on doing whatever we can to support the family and our team especially those who worked closely with him” the BoA spokesperson told The Post.

Howe did not reply to multiple requests for comment.

Lukena who lived in Brooklyn had been a Green Beret for more than a decade — from 2013 until he joined the bank as a full-time employee last July — according to his LinkedIn page.

He posted news about the deal between UMB Financial and Heartland Financial on LinkedIn days before his death.

He was a member of 51 Vets a nonprofit dedicated to connecting transitioning and transitioned veterans from elite military communities with leading businesses according to its website.

“51 Vets completely changed the trajectory of my post military career. Outstanding organization with an incredible mission” Lukenas had recently posted on LinkedIn.

A fundraiser for his family launched by 51 Vets has already raised $258962 as of early Thursday afternoon including $10000 from hedge fund titan Bill Ackman.

“This was an organic campaign organized by our members” 51 Vets founder Jordan Selleck told The Post.

“This speaks to the pain in the veteran community and Leo’s reputation in the community.”

“On May 2nd 2024 51 Vets lost a father husband son Green Beret and member” 51 Vets says on its site.

“Leo left behind a wife and two young children. Leo spent over a decade in Army Special Operations deploying multiple times with 1st Special Forces Group. He was dedicated to everything he did never settling for good enough. He always set the example and held himself to the highest standards prioritizing the team and mission success over himself.”

Lukenas’ dedication to work is why some on Wall Street are quick to link his passing to a culture they believe values wealth over well-being.

While there is no direct evidence to suggest his work had anything to do with his death numerous studies have linked acute stress to thrombosis.

Lukenas’ shocking death reopened a longstanding debate on Wall Street about a bank’s responsibility to employees.

More than a decade ago Moritz Erhardt a 21-year-old intern at Bank of America in London died after working until 6 a.m. three nights in a row.

A coroner concluded that Erhardt’s death from an epileptic seizure that limited his oxygen supply may have been triggered by fatigue.

Following his death banks made an effort to restrict employee work hours.

That discussion was reignited in 2021 after a PowerPoint presentation compiled by 13 Goldman Sachs junior bankers and calling out brutal workweeks leaked to the popular Wall Street influencer Litquidity.

“What is not ok to me is 110-120 hours over the course of a week! The math is simple that leaves 4 hours for eating sleeping showering bathroom and general transition time. This is beyond the level of ‘hard-working’ it is inhuman/ abuse” one analyst wrote at the time.

In response banks began hiring more staff to lighten junior employees’ workloads and limit hours.

But over the last year as Wall Street profits dropped and firms prepared for a possible recession several banks — including Bank of America — cut the workforce once again.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlbGlzaC5jb20vZm9vZC1uZXdzL2E2MDc0NDU5NS90cmF2aXMta2VsY2UtY2xhaW1zLWFsd2F5cy1kcnVuay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Travis Kelce Is Clapping Back At Claims He's 'Always Drunk',"Earlier this week country singer and actor Jana Kramer took to her podcast to well slander Travis Kelce's name. The iHeart Radio host dissed the Kansas City Chiefs tight end for his drinking habits and claimed he's ""always drunk."" Now Kelce is hitting back via multiple insiders.

""He was taken aback as he’s never met her and is just living his life"" the source told Page Six while ""emphatically"" denying any suggestion the athlete has a drinking problem. ""That guy is under a microscope basically being watched everywhere he goes. Of course you're going to see him drinking"" the source said.

Kramer even took aim at Kelce's influence on his girlfriend Taylor Swift arguing that he has encouraged the singer's consumption habits.

""I see her drinking more now. Like the company you keep"" Kramer alleged while also calling Kelce out for his ""aggression"" with coach Andy Reid during the Super Bowl. It ""rubbed [her] the wrong way.""

The same insider went on to argue that if Kelce did have a drinking problem it would be impossible to hide given his status and constant

""It’s not like he’s passed out somewhere. If he was passed out somewhere I would totally understand but that’s not the case whatsoever"" the source adds while noting that he's just a ""normal human being"" who is ""doing the same thing"" as everyone else...only ""in the public eye.""

The three-time Super Bowl champ is reportedly ""in training right now"" to prepare for another season with the Chiefs. ""If he was drunk it would be a bigger problem"" the source said.

This isn't the first time Kelce has come under fire for drinking. During his honorary graduation ceremony for his ""New Heights"" podcast Travis accepted the diploma he never picked up in the first place before chugging a beer in celebration. However big brother Jason was quick to his defense.

""I know it looks like a graduation from the video but this was actually at the end of a New Heights Live podcast that we put on to raise money for the University’s NIL"" the older Kelce said according to People Magazine. ""The university did this to poke fun at my brother and I for never really picking up our diplomas."""

Resonance is defined as a physical phenomenon where the response of a dynamical system reaches a maximum amplitude as a result of an applied periodic force. Nevertheless what are dynamical systems and periodic forces? Brief explanations will be provided in the following lines to lay out a conceptual intuition before diving into the experiments.

**** Note that readers with a background in physics or mathematics can skip the first part of the introduction and dive right into the project objectives and experiments.

1.Dynamical system

Nouns are used to represent everyday objects. For example if one observes an assembled piece of metal supported by four wheels travelling on the highway the word car comes to mind. Qualitative description allows us to communicate and describe everyday objects without having to spend too much brainpower. Although being extremely useful qualitative representation does not take into consideration the full complexity of our surroundings. Quantification becomes necessary when specific details are required. A set of physical values such as dimension temperature mass are assigned to bring further clarification. For the most part the quantified values assign to an object remain constant over time. However special kinds of objects require a different form of quantification to represent their full complexity. Specifically the quantified values used as descriptions do not remain constant over time. For instance the precise dimension of a flower can not take a specific value since it is slowly evolving at any moment in time. It requires a function to describe how the dimension evolves. Namely the flower is what we referred to as a dynamical system. Many other examples exist in nature giving rise to fascinating behaviour.

Everyday examples of dynamical systems:

- Swinging Pendulum (Constant periodic change between potential and kinetic energy)

- Population Growth (Constant periodic increase and decrease of the population as a result of predator/prey interactions and reproduction)

- The Human Brain (A constant periodic change of chemical signalling concentration across neuronal cells)

2. Periodic Force

Forces induce change. It is often referred to as a transfer of energy upon which a given object changes its natural state. For example a cup of tea sitting at a precise position on a table will change if a small force is applied toward a given direction. A force becomes periodic when the applied stimulus is not constant over time. For example pushing a child sitting on a swinging pendulum every time a maximum height is reached is considered periodic since the external action only occurs at specific moments in time. It is such periodic external actions that induce a change on a system or object that is referred to as periodic forces.

Everyday examples of periodic forces or stimuli:

- Human senses - Light waves interacting with photoreceptors of the eyes and allowing vision. Sound waves stimulating the eardrums and making music enjoyable.

- Seasons - Periodic alteration of environmental conditions such as temperature that affect biological ecosystems.

- Alternating Current - Periodic input signal altering the internal dynamics of an electronic circuit.

Having now gained a brief intuition about the principle of dynamical systems and periodic perturbations we are forced to wonder about the possible responses a dynamical system can exhibit due to a periodic stimulus. For example what would happen to the child sitting on a swinging pendulum if the amplitude of the external push keeps increasing to infinity while the applied frequency matches perfectly with the natural swinging frequency of the pendulum? Doubtlessly nature is capable of shocking responses!

3. Resonance

Resonance occurs when the amplitude of a dynamical system is driven to a maximum value due to an applied periodic force. For example the amplitude of a swinging pendulum increases dramatically even when a minimal force is applied at the right moment in time. For instance finding ourselves sitting on a swinging pendulum with a child applying a minimal push would nevertheless increase the swinging amplitude to a maximum if and only if the child applies the external push periodically when the potential energy of the pendulum is at a maximum. Under such circumstances the external actions of the child are referred to as inducing resonance on the swinging pendulum.

After all why should we care about resonance phenomena?

Surprisingly our life depends on resonance in many aspects:

Telecommunication - Radio communication occurs by a resonant action of an electromagnetic signal acting on electronic circuits.

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance - The resonant action of an electromagnetic field on the atomic nucleus allows to gain physical information about various chemicals and biological materials.

Tacoma Narrow Bridge disaster - Ignoring the power of resonance can lead to unexpected failures. For example a small wind perturbation led to the collapse of the Tacoma Narrow Bridge. Note that it is still debated whether resonance served as the underlying cause of the disaster. Regardless the Tacoma Bridge disaster demonstrates the often surprising response nature can exhibit due to small periodic perturbations.

Chladni Plate Experiment - The induced action of sounds on a vibrating plate having sand creating beautiful geometrical patterns based on the vibrating frequency. The experiment brings to life the geometrical patterns associated with the vibration nature is capable of.

Wine glass breaking by the action of sound - The experiment demonstrates the ability of sounds waves to induced resonance on a wine glass and consequently leading to shattering of the glass.

The importance of Resonance in Music - A very resourceful lecture given by Dr. Walter Lewin from MIT demonstrates the action of resonance in music.

How can we observe resonance experimentally?

Among many methods available to investigate resonance electronic circuits arise as an efficient experimental model since the dynamical properties of the circuit can easily be modified by changing the electronic properties of the components. In 1983 Leon O. Chua proposed one of the most simple circuit configurations exhibiting chaotic behaviour. In other words the Chua's Circuit exhibits complex non-linear behaviour and arises as a perfect experimental system to gain further insights into non-linear resonance.

The present project explores non-linear resonance in the Chua's Circuit subjected to a wide range of input signals. Specifically what are the possible external signals capable of inducing a maximum amplitude response in the Chua's Circuit system? The path to the answer is divided into three sections:

1) First the theoretical principles underlying various forms of resonances will be reviewed theoretically. Mathematica software will be used as a computational environment allowing to reach theoretical intuition.

2) After clarifying the theoretical parameters of interest for the interpretation of resonance phenomenon the Chua's Circuit will be explored through circuit simulation using LTspice.

3) Lastly experimental measurements will be gathered by designing and manufacturing a PCB board following Chua's design. The design process will be undertaken using Eagle software. The production of the circuit will rely on JLC PCB as a manufacturing house. Once assembled a signal generator will be used to subject the circuit to a wide range of input signals where the output response will be measured using an oscilloscope.

Overall the present project guides young students or curious individuals to learn more about resonance phenomena using the Chua's circuit as an experimental system. Additionally the process of designing the Chua's circuit can become resourceful for individuals wanting to explore chaotic behaviour in electronic circuits. Pieces of literature and tutorials will be provided at each experimental step if one requires further information about the procedures followed and the underlying theories.

Discussion & Conclusion from the Analysis

Having now gained some theoretical intuitions in Mathematica let us reach some preliminary conclusions.

1) Known Types of Resonances

- Stochastic Resonance

NOISE-INDUCED PHENOMENA

QUANTIFICATION METHODS: FREQUENCY RESPONSE (Q) MEAN RESIDENCE TIME SWITCHING RATE SIGNAL-TO-NOISE RATIO (SNR)

Noise is intuitively assumed to distract and interfere when precision is required. However stochastic resonance proves the contrary. Provided a bistable system subjected to an external periodic force of frequency W and a minimal amplitude A the system will fail to alternate between one stable equilibrium and a lack of external energy. Yet when noise is added to the external periodic force the signal-to-noise ratio measured at the input frequency W becomes maximized. As a result the system jumps periodically from one potential equilibrium to another. This is such noise action that is referred to as stochastic resonance.

- Vibrational Resonance

HIGH-FREQUENCY FORCE PHENOMENA

QUANTIFICATION --> FREQUENCY-RESPONSE (Q) MEAN WAITING TIME (Tmw)

As opposed to stochastic resonance vibrational resonance does not require a bistable system to induce a maximum response. In other words vibrational resonance can be induced in dynamical systems having possible equilibrium states higher than two. The noise term found in stochastic resonance is replaced by a high-frequency force that allows the system to transition from stability and adventure widely in the phase space. Such transition induced by a high-frequency force is often associated with a maximum response by excitable systems such as biological tissues.

- Ghost Resonance

UNEXPECTED FREQUENCY PHENOMENON

QUANTIFICATION --> FREQUENCY-RESPONSE (Q) MEAN WAITING TIME (Tmw).

What if the principles underlying stochastic and vibrational resonance are combined? Surprisingly combining two periodic forces paired with a noise threshold induces a maximum response at a frequency missing from the input driving force. Namely the output signal is amplified at a frequency that is absent from the input. Thus a ghost frequency response can be triggered by either a noise intensity (ghost-stochastic resonance) or a high-frequency force (ghost-vibrational resonance).

- Coherence Resonance

LONELY NOISE PHENOMENON

QUANTIFICATION --> POWER SPECTRUM TIME CORRELATION FUNCTION TIME BETWEEN PULSES (Tp) EXCURSION TIME (Te) ACTIVATION TIME (Ta)

Coherence resonance share similarity with stochastic resonance. The addition of a small noise intensity reaching a specific threshold induces a maximum amplitude response by the system. Contrarily to stochastic resonance coherence resonance does not require a periodic force. The noise only is capable of inducing resonance on dynamical systems.

- Autoresonance

PHASE-LOCKED PHENOMENON

QUANTIFICATION: FREQUENCY SWEEP-RATE / CHIRP RATE

Autoresonance arises from an external driving force having a frequency that is changing over time. Specifically the driven system continuously adjusts its oscillation amplitude so that the period of oscillation stays ""phased locked"" with the period of the driving force. As a result the system is forced to reach extremely high amplitude. Surprisingly the phase-locking mechanisms underlying autoresonance occurs even when the parameters of the systems are varied. In fact parametric autoresonance can also act on one or more system parameters only. The behaviour of a system under autoresonance becomes therefore dependent on the external driving force. One may wonder about the possibility of observing phase-locking phenomena between systems located at large distances.

- Parametric Resonance

PERIODIC CHANGE OF SYSTEM'S PARAMETERS

QUANTIFICATION: POWER SPECTRUM FREQUENCY RESPONSE (Q)

The characteristic of parametric resonance is fundamentally different from other resonances where an external driving force is necessary. A maximum amplitude response arises when one or more system parameters change periodically over time for parametric resonance. For instance a system with a natural frequency exhibiting periodic change will have a maximum amplitude response when the rate of change reaches a specific threshold. Parametric resonance can also occur from the periodicity of other parameters such as stiffness damping density etc.

*** Note that the provided examples are only a small portion of the possible ways resonance can occur. Additionally the examples do not adopt a quantum physics interpretation of oscillator systems making possible many surprising phenomena. For the curious wanting to learn more a book providing in-depth information regarding the theory and a wide range of experimental observations can be found HERE.

2) Parameters of Interest

The parameters of interest to interpret resonance in Chua's Circuit system can be divided into two categories. A set of parameters describing the circuit's behaviour (system) and parameters describing the input signal (force).

Systems Parameters:

The parameters describing the state of the circuit over time can be further categorized based on three criteria found to be necessary for chaos to occur in electronic circuits. * :

1)One or more non-linear elements --> Chua's Diode composed of:

- Operational Amplifiers

The values of parameters M0 and M1 found in the provided equations arise from different design configurations and become critical to describe the non-linear property of the circuit.

2)One or more locally active resistors (Negative resistance within Chua's Diode sub-circuit):

- Resistors R1 R2 R3 R4 R5 R6

3)Three or more energy storage elements:

Inductor L1

Capacitor C1

Capacitor C2

Taken together the dynamical state of the circuit becomes describable with only three variables:

- Voltage Across Capacitor C1 = (V1) or (X)

- Voltage Across Capacitor C2 = (V1) or (Y)

- Current Across Inductor L1 = (I) or (Z)

The time evolution of the circuit is described by three ordinary differential equations found in the provided visuals. In addition the non-linear property of the resistor is mathematically represented by the function f(V1) which can arise with various levels of complexity based on the chosen circuit configuration.

Another useful resource providing theoretical insights regarding the implementation of the Chua's Circuit can be found in the following

Input Signal Parameters

Having now identified the system parameters describing the dynamical behaviour of the Chua's circuit and the known type of resonances let us clarify the parameters to be considered when selecting the property of the input signals. As you have probably deduced by now the range of input parameters become categorized based on the various types of resonances.

Stochastic Resonance--> Periodic force paired with noise.

- Amplitude (A1)

- Frequency (f1)

- Noise Variance / Intensity (D)

** Additional parameters can be necessary to represent complex noise functions.

Vibrational Resonance --> Biharmonic force is composed of a low-frequency and high-frequency force.

- Amplitude (A1)

- Frequency (f1) where (f1 < f2)

- Amplitude (A2)

- Frequency (f2) where (f2 > f1)

Ghost Resonance --> The sum of periodic forces paired with a noise term.

- Amplitude (An) - where n depends on the number of forces.

- Frequency (fn) - where n depends on the number of forces.

- Noise Variance / Intensity (D)

** The external signals inducing Ghost Resonance can arise with various levels of complexity. Additional parameters can be necessary.

Coherence Resonance --> Noise term only.

- Noise variance / Intensity (D)

** Noise can be induced with various levels of complexity and therefore might require additional parameters.

Autoresonance --> The frequency of the driving force changes over time.

- Amplitude (A1)

- Time-Dependent Frequency (f(t))

** The evolution of the force-frequency can arise in various forms and will likely require additional parameters.

Parametric Resonance --> Absence of external perturbations.

The parameters of interest describe the time evolution of the system's parameters rather than external perturbations.

- Time-Evolution of natural frequency (w(t))

- Time-Evolution of sampling (d(t))

*** The wide range of possible complexities dynamical systems can exhibit might therefore require additional parameters.

Step 2: Circuit Simulation Using LTSpice

1 / 13

Objectives:

1) What input signal parameters can induce vibrational resonance in Chua's Circuit system?

2) What signal analysis techniques are required to interpret the response of the circuit?

*** The present section does not serve as an LTSPICE tutorial and will focus primarily on describing the procedures followed during the project. However links to tutorials and resources are provided below if one wishes to gain further insights into the features offered by LTSPICE.

Producing the Simulation NETLIST / Circuit Diagram

Luckily LTSpice comes with a friendly user interface that allows producing a schematic with conventional electronic components without having to represent the circuit through computer code:

1) Gather the necessary components within the circuit diagram work-space:

- Two 22Kohms resistors.

- Two 220ohms resistors.

- One 3.3Kohms resistor.

- One 2.2Kohms resistor.

- One 2.0K resistor. (Potentiometer)

- One 10nF capacitor.

- One 100nF capacitor.

- One 18mH inductor.

- Two voltage inputs.

- One Ground.

- OpAmps: Since the TL082 is not available within the default libraries available in LTSPICE the LT1057 or the LT1113 can be used to simulate the circuit. Alternatively the SPICE model of the TL082 can be downloaded and imported within the design environment. Further details about the procedures to follow in order import models can be found HERE & HERE. Also an already made design of the Chua's Circuit using the TL082 can be downloaded from HERE (Very insightful resources).

2) Connect each component by following the provided Chua's design. Also ensure to assign the proper values to each component.

3) Since the parameters of interest representing the state of the circuit are the voltage across capacitor C1 capacitor C2 and the current across the inductor L voltage probes are added accordingly.

4) Let us now explore the effect of varying the value of resistor R7 located between capacitor C1 and capacitor C2. Once a specific resistance threshold value is reached the circuit exhibit chaotic behaviour. To observe the double scroll chaotic signature the voltage across capacitor C1 (V(vc1) probe) must be plotted on the horizontal axis and the voltage across capacitor C2 (V(vc2)) on the vertical axis.

The simulation parameters are set as follow:

- Type: Transient

- Stop Time: 0.10

- Time to start saving data: 0

- Maximum Timestep: 1E-5

The chaotic signatures obtained from the simulation confirm that the netlist produced adheres to Chua's Circuit properties. The resistance value from R7 inducing optimal Chaotic behaviour appeared to be centred around 1.5KOhms. However the system's dynamic changes drastically at resistance values below 1.485 KOhms and above 1.965 KOhms. Although the objective of the present simulation is not to investigate chaos feel free to explore how the resistance value of R7 affects the chaotic behaviour of the circuit.

Observing Resonance in LTSPICE

The following procedures will primarily focus on exploring vibrational resonance to minimize the length of the project. However the other types of resonances can also be investigated by adjusting the input signal parameters. (A1 f1 A2 f2)

Vibrational Resonance (HIGH-FREQUENCY FORCE)

The action of vibrational resonance is an enhanced amplitude of the output signal found at a frequency matching the external frequency (f1) of the low-frequency driving force (F1) by the addition of a high-frequency (f2) periodic force (F2).

Simulation Parameters:

- Type: Transient

- Stop Time: 100ms

- Start Time: 50ms

- Time Step Max: 1*10^-5

System's Parameters:

The system's parameters selected for the simulation can be derived from the provided simulation schematic.

Input Parameters:

FORCE 1 (F1)

- Amplitude (A1) = (0.3 V 0.8 V 1.3 V 1.8V)

- Frequency (f1) must be <(f2) = (50 Hz 100 Hz 150 Hz 200 Hz)

FORCE 2 (F2)

- Amplitude (A2) = (0.5 V 1.5 V 2.5 V 3.5 V)

- Frequency (f2) must be >(f1) = (500 Hz 1500 Hz 2500 Hz 3500 Hz)

Expected Outcomes / Hypothesis:

- Under Fast Fourier Transform analysis (FFT) the amplitude of the output signal at frequency matching (f1) will be maximized when the parameters (A2) and (f2) reach specific values.

- Under amplitude response analysis the amplitude of the output signal will reach a maximum only when parameters (A1) (A2) (f1) (f2) reach specific threshold values.

- Under time series analysis the voltage state across capacitor 1 (V1) will periodically switch between (V1 < 0) and (V1 > 0) with a period equal to half the period of frequency (f1) once parameters (A2) and (f2) reach specific values.

Observations:

Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) Analysis:

1) As parameter (f2) increases from 500 Hz to 3500 Hz incremented by 1000 Hz the amplitude of the output signal (V1) at (f1 = 100Hz) reaches a maximum when (f2) is equal to 1500 Hz.

2) As parameter (A2) increases from 0.5 V to 3.5 V incremented by 1.0 V the amplitude of the output signal (V1) at (f1 = 100 Hz) reaches a maximum when (A2) is equal to 0.5 V.

3)As parameter (f1) increases from 50 Hz to 200 Hz incremented by 50 Hz the amplitude of the output signal (V1) at (f1) reaches a maximum when (f1) reaches 200 Hz.

4) As parameter (A1) increases from 0.3 V to 1.8 V incremented by 0.5V the amplitude of the output signal (V1) at (f1 = 200 Hz) reaches a maximum when (A1) is equal to 1.8 V.

Amplitude Response (Q) Analysis:

- Gather FFT data where the amplitude is reported in dBV.

- Convert the amplitude from dBV to V. (V = 10exp(dBV / 20))

- Calculate the Amplitude Response (Q) where Q = (Output Amplitude (V) / Input Amplitude (A1))

1) The results obtained from the first analysis correlate with the data obtained during the simulation. Specifically the Response Amplitude Q reaches a maximum threshold when the high-frequency force value (f2) is around 1500 Hz.

2) Similarly the result obtained during the second amplitude response analysis shows the Amplitude Response Q increasing as the amplitude of the high-frequency force (A2) decreases.

*** The Excel sheet used to gather the simulation results from LTSpice and produce the Amplitude Response graph can be downloaded HERE. The same analysis procedures can be followed to gain further insights into the optimal values for the other parameters.

Time Series Analysis:

As the amplitude of the high-frequency force (A2) is increased from 0.00V to 1.50V the system undergoes a periodic switching from V1 < 0 and V1 > 0. Calculating the mean residence time for V1 = + and V1 = - demonstrate that once (A2) reaches a critical value MRT+ becomes equal to MRT-. Furthermore at such a critical value of (A2) the periodic switching between V1>0 and V1<0 becomes half the period of the low-frequency force (Periodic Switching = 1/2*(1/f1)).

*** Further information into the time-series signature of vibrational resonance can be gained HERE.

Step 3: Hardware Design & Assembly

1 / 10

Objectives:

1) Designing the Chua's Circuit PCB using Eagle.

2) Providing the manufacturing files to JLC PCB for production and order the required components from Mouser.

3) Assembling the circuit.

Eagle General Tutorial Links:

For further insights into the features of Eagle feel free to explore the tutorial links below.

Circuit Schematic in Eagle

1) Create a new folder under the projects section of Eagle's main page.

2) Create a schematic design file by right-clicking the project folder and selecting NEW --> SCHEMATIC.

3) The first task when creating a new schematic is to import a frame inside the design workspace. Select the ADD-PART button and search for the frame library. (FRAME_A_L with dimension 8 1/2 * 11 INCH Landscape) was selected for the project.

4) The required electronic components must now be selected from available libraries and imported into the design workspace. Select the ADD-PART button and gather the components to reproduce Chua's Circuit design. A list of all the components used during the project can be accessed HERE.

*** Note that different components from other libraries could have also been used. Since we are not doing any simulation inside eagle the critical criteria when selecting your components is to ensure the footprint and package type match the components ordered from electronic suppliers. Failing to do soo will lead to difficulties when soldering the chips onto the PCB board since the soldering pin layout will not match those components.

5) Assign names and values to all components.

6) Proceed to create the circuit schematic by connecting each component following Chua's Circuit design.

PCB Routing and Manufacturing

1) Once the components have been connected and the circuit diagram fully completed click the GENERATE/SWITCH TO BOARD button to generate a PCB layout workspace.

2) To control board layout and dimension Fusion 360 is used for the design process.

3) Once the PCB layout is completed in Fusion 360 it is imported into Eagle's PCB layout workspace by clicking the FUSION 360 vertical button on the right. Further insights into the procedure required to import the PCB from Fusion 360 can be found HERE.

4) Having all the components and the desired PCB layout within the Eagle environment we must place each component onto the PCB board. To ease the routing process ensure the location of each component follows the logic of the schematic.

5) Each air wire connecting the components must be routed onto the surface of the PCB. You can either manually route each connection or utilize the auto-router option to have EAGLE automatically create all your connections. Given the simplicity of the schematic manual routing was used to ensure all pins were routed correctly. In addition a polygon was created to provide collective ground to all components. Further information on routing methods as well as creating the polygon can be found HERE. Note that before proceeding to the next section one can delete or add text on the PCB board for descriptive purposes.

6) Once all routing connections have been completed we review all design parameters to ensure the PCB layout produces the intended output. Also the manufacturing parameters must be adjusted to comply with the requirements of the manufacturing house. All details about the procedures of finalizing the design parameters and producing the required Gerber file to send for manufacturing can be found HERE.

7) Once the Gerber manufacturing ZIP file has been generated a manufacturing house must be selected to order the board. More details about the manufacturing options to take into consideration can be found HERE. For the current project the Gerber files were uploaded to the JLC PCB ordering page.

Assembling the Circuit

- Given the size of the components a microscope is necessary to solder the components appropriately onto the PCB. Alternatively you can select the SMT assembly option when ordering your PCB from JLC PCB and have them assemble all the components for you. Further details can be found HERE.

- The + and - pins of the operational amplifier IC are not easily noticeable. Therefore ensure to solder the IC with the reference line-oriented horizontally on the opposite side of the potentiometer.

- When soldering the potentiometer utilizing the left and middle pin will increase the resistance when the knob is rotated clockwise. Contrarily using the right and middle pin will increase the resistance when the knob is counter-clockwise.

*** Since the present research project is in constant progress different circuit configurations will be made available in the future on the Github Project Repository.

Step 4: Experiments

1 / 14

Objectives:

1) What resistance value is required across the potentiometer to observe chaotic behaviour in the circuit?

2) How does the amplitude value (A2) of the high-frequency force (F2) affect the time-series evolution of the circuit under vibrational resonance?

Observing Chaos:

1) Connect channel #1 of the oscilloscope to output 1 of the circuit reporting the voltage across capacitor C1.

2) Connect channel #2 of the oscilloscope to output 2 of the circuit reporting the voltage across capacitor C2.

3) Connect the two 9V batteries to their respective battery jacks.

4) Adjust the oscilloscope settings to X-Y mode to plot the voltage across capacitor C1 on the X-axis and the voltage across capacitor C2.

5) Adjust the scale of each axis until the measurement resolution is appropriate.

6) Slowly turn the knob of the potentiometer to find the appropriate resistance value for chaotic behaviour to occur. This process can be extremely tedious if you have any unstable connections or improper potentiometer resistance.

7) Although not the most precise method a multimeter can measure the resistance value induced by the potentiometer.

Chaos Measurement #1:

Resistance Value (R) = 1.194 KOhm

Horizontal Axis (V1) = 100 mV/div

Vertical Axis (V2) = 500 mV/div

Chaos Measurement #2:

Resistance Value (R) = 0.750 KOhm

Horizontal Axis (V1) = 50 mV/div

Vertical Axis (V2) = 500 mV/div

Chaos Measurement #3:

Resistance Value (R) = 1.240 KOhm

Horizontal Axis (V1) = 100 mV/div

Vertical Axis (V2) = 500 mV/div

Chaos Measurement #4:

Resistance Value (R) = 1.220 KOhm

Horizontal Axis (V1) = 200 mV/div

Vertical Axis (V2) = 1.00 V/div

Observation & Discussion

The state-space representation of the circuit produced by the oscilloscope in X-Y mode allows analyzing the dynamical behaviour of the circuit by plotting the voltage across capacitor C1 on the X-axis and the voltage across capacitor C2 on the Y-axis. You can imagine a small point within the X-Y plot of the oscilloscope as the state of the circuit at an arbitrary time T. As time evolves the collection of state measurements (points) gives rise to a geometrical representation where the state evolution of the system produce geometrical patterns. For example from measurement #1 with a resistance value around 1.194 KOhm we observe the state of the system orbiting around an equilibrium point through a total of four different orbits. The number of orbits increases as the resistance value across the potentiometers approaches the threshold required to induce chaos in the circuit which is found to be around 1.220 KOhm. As observed in measurement #4 the system's state under chaotic behaviour can jump from positive orbits to negative orbits. Theoretically a specific set of parameters values where the dynamical evolution of the state from one attractor to another becomes completely ""random."" Surprisingly such chaotic property is useful for many applications such as cryptography. Further theoretical insights into the evolution of chaos in the Chua's Circuit can be found HERE & HERE.

The size difference between the two scroll attractors is due to input power asymmetry. Specifically asymmetry arises when there is a small voltage difference between the batteries positive and negative input sources. For instance the negative power provided by one battery might be 0.7 V less in magnitude than the positive input. Therefore a power supply can be utilized to compensate for the power difference by applying 9V and -9.7V through the input of the operational amplifiers.

Additionally the type of diode utilized in the circuit is critical for chaos to occur. A wide range of diodes led to the inability to observe any chaotic behaviour in the circuit. The 18mH 5% inductor from Fastron was found to allow the best results.

Vibrational Resonance Experiment:

1) Connect channel #1 of the signal generator into the input jack #1 of the circuit.

2) Connect channel #2 of the signal generator into the input jack #2 of the circuit.

3) Connect channel #1 of the oscilloscope into output #1 of the circuit reporting the voltage across capacitor C1.

4) Connect channel #2 of the oscilloscope into output #2 of the circuit reporting the voltage across capacitor C2.

5)Ensure to firmly mount the circuit to avoid any loose connections during the measurement process.

6) Connect the two 9V batteries to their respective battery jack.

7) Set the oscilloscope to time series more and briefly adjust the scale of each axis as well as the sampling rate until you can observe a clear sine wave for both channel #1 and channel #2.

8) For time series analysis we want to measure one channel output at a time to maximize clarity. Therefore turn off the channel #1 display on the oscilloscope.

9) Adjust the resistance value of the potentiometer to 1.350 KOhm.

*** To minimize the length of the project only the effect of the amplitude (A2) of the high-frequency force (F2) will be explored. Also only a time series analysis of the output signal will be presented. Adjusting the oscilloscope mode to FFT could allow exploring the frequency component of the output signal. Feel free to experiment with different input parameters and measurement methods.

Resonance Measurement [#1 - #8]

Resistance Value (R): R = 1.350 KOhm

Input Signal Parameters:

CH1 (Force #1) Amplitude = 0.3 V

CH1 (Force #1) Frequency = 50 Hz

CH2 (Force #2) Amplitude = [0.0 V - 3.5 V - 4.5 V - 5.5 V - 6.5 V - 7.5 V - 8.5 V ]

CH2 (Force #2) Frequency = 500 Hz

Observation & Discussion:

Once a threshold value of (A2) is reached the system can jump from positive values to negative values. The time spent by the system in the positive and negative regions is referred to as the residence time (T+ T-). Taking all the residence times over a period of time allows us to calculate the mean residence time (Tmr+ Tmr-). In measurement number #3 the mean residence time between positive (T+) and negative (T-) differ drastically. The system is found to output negative values during a short period of time compared with the time spent in the positive region. As the input amplitude (A2) increases from 4.5 V in measurement #3 up to an amplitude (A2) of 8.5 V in measurement #8 the difference between the positive mean residence time (Tmr+) and the negative mean residence time (Tmr-) is found to decrease. For a specific threshold value of amplitude (A2_max) the mean residence time between positive and negative values becomes equal. Further analysis could demonstrate that the periodic switching from positive region to negative region at amplitude value equal to (A2_max) occurs with a period equal to half the period of the low-frequency input (f1). It is at such an input threshold that vibrational resonance occurs. Given the parameters selected for the experiment A2_max is found to be around 8.5V. The relatively high voltage threshold compared with the results obtained during the simulation is likely due to the resistance value (R) set at 1.350 KOhm during the experiment. Furthermore an amplitude response analysis could have been calculated to find the specific value of A2_max for a range of values close to 8.5V.

*** Note that the present research project is still ongoing and future updates regarding experiments will be added on the Github Project Page and Research Gate.

Step 5: Summary - Conclusion - Future Directions

Summary

Together the present project lays the groundwork for future experiments investigating non-linear resonance using Chua's Circuit as an experimental system. Here's below a summary of the preliminary conclusions reached during the project:

Theory

A total of six different types of resonances were reviewed:

- Stochastic Resonance (Periodic force paired with noise)

- Vibrational Resonance (High-frequency biharmonic force)

- Coherence Resonance (Noise Only)

- Ghost Resonance (Biharmonic force paired with noise leading to unexpected output frequency)

- Parametric Resonance (Periodic system's parameters)

- Auto-Resonance (Phase-locking with the external force)

The time evolution of the Chua's Circuit was modelled with three parameters of interest and three ordinary differential equations:

- Voltage across capacitor 1 (V1)

- Voltage across capacitor 2 (V2)

- Current across the inductor (L)

Simulation

For the simulation parameters selected specific input values were found to induce a maximum amplitude response by the circuit under vibrational resonance:

- Force 1 Amplitude (A1): 1.8 V

- Force 2 Amplitude (A2): 0.5 V

- Force 1 Frequency (f1): 200 Hz

- Force 2 Frequency (f2): 1500 Hz

Three types of signal analysis methods were reported to interpret the resonant response of the circuit:

- Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) Analysis: Allowing to decompose the output signal into its frequency components.

- Amplitude Response Analysis (Q): Allowing to derive the maximum amplitude value for a range of input parameters.

- Time-series Analysis: Allowing to observe the evolution of the system over time.

Hardware Design

The following electronics components properties were selected:

Capacitor C1: 100 nF

Capacitor C2: 10 nF

Inductor L: 18 mH

Variable Resistor R: 2 KOhm

Resistor R2: 220 Ohms

Resistor R3: 220 Ohms

Resistor R4: 2.2 KOhm

Resistor R5: 22 KOhm

Resistor R6: 22 KOhm

Resistor R7: 3.3 KOhm

Operational Amplifier: TL082

Experiments

Under the selected experimental parameters chaotic behaviour by the circuit was found to occur at a specific resistance value of:

- Resistance Value (R) = 1.220 KOhm

Under vibrational resonance a periodic switching between positive and negative values was found to be induced by a threshold amplitude value of the high-frequency force:

- Force 2 Amplitude (A2) = 7.5 V (+- 1.0V) (Approximate Solution)

Future Directions

Exploring other types of resonances in the Chua's Circuit by exploring various input parameters. For example can other types of non-linear resonance be observed in the Chua's Circuit system?

Investigating the propagation of resonant input signals between multiple Chua's Circuit coupled following different network topologies. How would the state evolution of each coupled system differ over time? For example would the maximum response amplitude by the circuit subjected to the input signal indirectly induce the other systems in the network?

Exploring resonance in biological systems. Given the non-linear properties of biological organisms can similarity be found between the resonant response of the Chua's circuit and the response of living systems to external stimulus? Can the principles underlying non-linear resonance allow us to gain further insights into the physical mechanisms allowing long-range communication between living organisms?

Turning non-linear resonance into practicality. How can non-linear resonance be used in future design to solve practical problems?

Get your industry-leading VFX stock footage at 25% off and get the AVFX Drive for 50% off!

A factory is generally made up of different departments all working together to produce the final product. The VFX industry is similar with many different departments each with its own area of expertise all working together to produce the final product. As you’d find in a factory each department requires a different set of tools and machinery to complete their task. In the VFX industry each department requires a different set of software tools to complete theirs!

We’ve created different categories based on areas of expertise to show you what software options are most commonly used by the big VFX Houses.

Meantime you can grab some amazing drag and drop VFX for your next project directly from ActionFX.

Rotoscoping

This skill is when the VFX artist basically traces around an object to create a mask that can then be used to remove the object from the shot to use on a different background. This process is quicker and easier when the background is a green or blue screen because you can then create this mask using color hues or Chroma range a process known as Chroma Keying.

The majority of Big VFX houses outsource their “Grunt work” (Matchmoving and Rotoscoping) to India or Asia but when they do do it they tend to use either Silhouette or Mochapro and some rotoscoping will be done in Nuke by Foundry.

Matchmoving

Matchmoving uses a variety of different techniques to track the movement of that camera that is filming a certain shot this enables them to create a virtual camera that mimics these movements so that when they composite any 3D elements they’ve created back into the original plate the scale orientation are perspective are perfectly matched.

This process (much like rotoscoping) is laborious and time-consuming and is generally “Outsourced” but the most popular software in use is 3D Equalizer SynthEyes and PFTrack. 3D Equalizer is the most popular and has been in use since 1996.

FX

This department is mainly responsible for creating natural effects water wind fire smoke magical effects and explosions. Unlike CG objects characters and animals these effects are all too big and too complicated to be animated by hand so VFX Artists simulate them using Procedural Simulation Software. The two that are most widely used are Houdini by SideFX and Maya by Autodesk. Houdini is however very much the most widely used so much so that it has become the industry’s standard.

We’ve left an insanely quicker and cheaper alternative in the description. ActionFX has tons of drag and drop VFX that you can just pop into your timeline scale and adjust and get cinema quality results in minutes! Be sure to check out our special discount in the description!

Modeling

Modeling artists create 3D models of characters animals plants and objects. Working from concept artwork photographs and other reference material they begin by creating a wireframe commonly referred to as a “Mesh” and then use digital tools to “sculpt” it. When ready the 3D models can then be passed on to be animated textured and lit. There are a lot of software options out there but the main ones used are Maya by Autodesk 3D Studio Max by Autodesk ZBrush by Pixologic Mudbox by Autodesk and MODO by Foundry. Maya and 3D Studio Max have become industry standards for building 3D characters creating particles rigging and animating whereas ZBrush has become the industry standard for 3D sculpting and Mudbox is its main competitor.

Animation

Animators use CG rigs to animate the objects previously created by the modelers. These rigs can be set up to control where the joints or pivot points of an object are or how far an object can move or rotate. The animators must then use these controls not only to control movement but to convey emotion. whereas a puppet may just drop its head an animated character will make you feel its sadness.

As far as software is concerned there is only one way to go Maya by Autodesk very much the industry standard and its use is so widespread that it’s really become the only option.

Texture and Shading

The Texture artist is responsible for creating photorealistic textures to be placed on the gray 3D models that were made by the modeling department.

Maya by Autodesk and 3D Studio Max by Autodesk are generally used for shading because both feature a Node-based shading system. Textures however are usually created with either Mari by Foundry Substance Painter by Adobe or Photoshop also by Adobe.

Rendering

This is the engine that is responsible for the final 3D image generation and is generally connected to the modeling and shading software. The most widely used are Renderman by Pixar Arnold by Autodesk and V-ray by Chaos.

Compositing

Compositors take all the CG components from each department and combine them with matte paintings and live-action footage to create the final shot.

Nuke by Foundry is the most popular and the most widely used a similar software is Fusion by Black Magic Design but it is far less popular.

After Effects by Adobe is also used but mainly for TV advertisement compositing or motion graphics because its layered-based system is too limited for major movie productions.

The Sports Barn is a new business offering indoor turf time to adults and kids. The facility has supplies for soccer corn hole spike ball and much more.

For co-owners Ryan and Amy Hanavan the launch is a dream come true.

MTN News

“My wife Amy has a background as a rec director. I've been coaching youth high school and college sports for over 20 years and we have always had this sort of passion where we just we'd like to offer opportunities for not just kids but adults as well"" Ryan Hanavan said. ""We want to create these affordable options for everybody to come in and play.”

The Sports Barn is near the end of an initial construction phase but soccer and lacrosse leagues are already underway and using the turf. A flag football league is in the works.

“Our construction is ongoing but we're still able to bring kids in here and have them play and adults as well” Hanavan explained.

The Sports Barn has a light or dark mode. For birthday parties or just for kicks the garage door is shut and LED lights turned on to create glow-in-the-dark fun.

""[It's] a way of trying to imagine how to use the space and how to bring people in and how to give them something affordable to just have fun with. So we're excited about that” Hanavan said.

The business plans to celebrate a grand opening in a few weeks. Right now they’re setting up pro-level golf simulators.

“What it allows you to do is play golf year-round which is a luxury that we do not get to enjoy at all in Montana” Andrew Calabro The Sports Barn golf and lacrosse specialist told MTN News.

The GCHawk technology has high-speed cameras that track club head and ball speed launch angle and more to produce ball flight as you play. Game stats show up on a TV similar to bowling.

“It will allow you to play courses that you would most likely never get the opportunity to play like Pebble Beach” Calabro said.

The PGA-level tech provides an opportunity for golfers to improve their game.

“Hitting a driving range is special and that's where a lot of people grow their golf game but when you really see the stats and especially with how many stats and everything that these machines can tell you about your swing it really opens up the opportunity to a drop a few strokes on your game but really start honing in what parts of your game need work” Calabro said.

The family team at The Sports Barn plans to add more activities in the future like batting cages or a putting green.

In this post I'll explain why your FICO score is so important how it's calculated and how you can learn what it is by taking advantage of the rapidly expanding list of credit cards that will tell you your score for free.

Your FICO score is instrumental in how financial institutions view your creditworthiness.

What are the different kinds of credit scores?

While there was originally only one FICO score companies have developed different ways to measure your creditworthiness as time has passed. These include the FICO score 8 or 9 as well as the VantageScore 3.0 and 4.0.

There are several differences between the two methods. The FICO scores 8 and 9 offer slightly different scores for each of the three major credit bureaus while VantageScore offers a single number for all three bureaus. Other differences include importance given to bills sent to collection credit utilization and hard inquiries.

Importance of the FICO credit score

Your FICO score (a product of the Fair Isaac Corporation) is the foundation of most financial transactions you make. If you want a loan at competitive interest rates be approved for a credit card or pass a background check you need to have an acceptable FICO score. Knowing your score can help you anticipate what to expect from these kinds of transactions.

Your FICO score isn't static. It evolves with your finances and you can improve (or damage) it depending on your degree of fiscal responsibility. That's important because it means you can cultivate a high score over time with good financial habits even if you have bad credit (or no credit). Your FICO score allows you to track the state of your finances and can alert you to any problems such as a missed payment or identity theft.

Knowing your FICO score is helpful when it comes to travel rewards because it can give you a sense of which credit cards you're likely to be approved for allowing you to maximize your applications.

The FICO formula is kept private but we know the factors that affect your score. (Image courtesy of Shutterstock)

How your FICO score is determined

TPG has written previously about how your FICO score is compiled; here's a brief refresher:

35% payment history

30% amounts owed

15% length of credit history

10% new credit

10% types of credit

The factors that affect your score the most are late or missed payments and your credit utilization — also known as the ratio of how much credit you're using to how much credit is available to you.

Length of credit history also affects your score so it makes sense to keep your oldest accounts open unless you have a compelling reason to close them. Negative ""remarks"" (like a late payment or accounts in collections) stay on your credit report for seven years. That's a long time to pay for a mistake and have it be an obstacle to earning points and miles. Fortunately negative remarks affect your score less and less as they age.

Credit cards that show your score

The good news is that accessing your FICO score for free is now easier than ever thanks in large part to the FICO Score Open Access Program launched by the Fair Isaac Corporation. This program allows credit card issuers that have already purchased the FICO information to share it with customers at no additional charge.

The following credit card issuers now offer your FICO score for free either online or with your monthly statement.

American Express provides its cardholders with not only an educational FICO score but also their Fico Score 8. The latter number is the credit score the issuer uses to manage cardmembers' accounts and is based on data from a major credit-rating agency Experian. Current cardholders can log into their accounts and access their score through account services.

Bottom line

Your FICO score is important to keep track of. Whether you're applying for a loan or a new credit card your credit score will provide a helpful indication of what you're eligible for and what interest rates you can expect. Fortunately most credit cards offer the ability to view your FICO score without hurting your credit so you'll want to make a habit of using these free services regularly.

The group is led by Stephen M. Kincade and Alexander S. Fridell and had overseen $1.45 billion in client assets according to a person familiar with their practice. The team also includes Stephen’s son Chris who is a junior advisor and client associates Zach Kingsley Jessica McEntee and Elle Schiowitz.

They had been well-known at Merrill’s private wealth group which includes around 200 teams serving ultra-wealthy customers for the size of their practice and also their well-heeled customers. Their client roster includes notables such as hedge fund manager Leon Cooperman according to a second source close to their practice.

Reached at his new UBS office Kincade who started his career at Goldman Sachs in 1985 declined to comm_ent on the move and also declined to comment or confirm any potential customers. He and Fridell had joined Merrill in 2012 from Barclays Capital in New York according to BrokerCheck.

A spokesperson for UBS declined to comment and a spokesperson for Merrill Lynch did not return a request for comment.

Merrill Wealth head Andy Sieg last week identified “competitive attrition” as an issue that required attention from the firm’s leadership. Losses of experienced brokers rose to around 5% annualized in the second quarter after running at around 4% in recent years a spokesman confirmed.

The company since 2019 has not disclosed the number of core brokers in its wealth business. Total headcount of advisors at Bank of America including thousands of private bankers and consumer-bank based brokers fell 2.1% in the second quarter and 5.9% year-over-year to 19385 the company said last week.

Recruiters have said that anecdotally departures of a number of high profile teams have been steady in recent years. Kincade and his team had worked on the same floor at One Bryant Park also known as Bank of America Tower as a $7-million prive wealth group led by Louis Meltzer Jacob M. Dunn and Hadi Fakhoury who left last September to join Morgan Stanley Wealth Management.

Kincade and his group had evaluated other firms including Morgan Stanley but opted for UBS because it was a better fit for their relatively transactional practice which had a focus on syndicate business the second source said.

UBS has also shown a willingness to open its wallet to compete with high-end offers from Morgan Stanley and other aggressive recruiters for some high-end teams recruiters have said.

Kincade also worked at Grigsby Brandford & Co. and Lehman Brothers before joining Barclays in 2009 according to his BrokerCheck. Fridell started at Citigroup’s Smith Barney in 2007 shifted to Lehman Brothers the following year and worked at Morgan Stanley for a stint before joining Barclays in 2009.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vam9zaGJlcnNpbi5jb20vMjAyMS8wNy93aGF0LWlzLWEtY2FwYWJpbGl0eS1hY2FkZW15LWhlcmVzLXRoZS1hbnN3ZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What Is A Capability Academy? Here's The Answer.,"Almost two years ago I started describing what I call a Capability Academy and the concept has really picked up speed. Well we just published a whole research report on the topic and in this topic I’ll give you some specific examples.

First most companies have over-rotated toward skills. Of course we all need skills to do our jobs well but this is really nothing new. I entered the workforce in 1978 and I’ve been developing technical professional and business skills ever since. It’s a never-ending part of your career.

Our research shows that there are three “types” of skills in business: technical professional and soft skills (which I call PowerSkills).

Technical skills include hundreds of technologies topics systems and processes. We all need to know how to type read use Excel and even write code. These technical skills are broad and deep and they are always changing. Lots of research shows that technical experts “top out” in their careers early so even tech professionals have to constantly refresh their technical skills. And if you work in pharmaceuticals energy manufacturing accounting or other industries there are hundreds of technical skills required to do your job.

Lots of research shows that technical experts “top out” in their careers early so even tech professionals have to constantly refresh their technical skills. And if you work in pharmaceuticals energy manufacturing accounting or other industries there are hundreds of technical skills required to do your job. Professional skills are the things your profession demands. If you’re an HR professional for example you better learn how to interview people recruit create performance plans and many other domain-specific things. We identified 94 of these professional skills in our Global HR Capability Project and each is complicated in its own way. Consider “Employment Branding” for example. It requires skills in marketing communications SEO analytics and lots of other things – all applied toward a particular professional problem.

are the things your profession demands. If you’re an HR professional for example you better learn how to interview people recruit create performance plans and many other domain-specific things. We identified 94 of these professional skills in our Global HR Capability Project and each is complicated in its own way. Consider “Employment Branding” for example. It requires skills in marketing communications SEO analytics and lots of other things – all applied toward a particular professional problem. Power skills (or soft skills) are all the human relationship teamwork and leadership skills we need. This ranges from listening and communications (the #1 most in-demand skill) to leading teams empathy patience inspiration and dozens more.

When you study this topic you quickly find that all three of these areas are essential and over time we build these skills in a contextual way. We learn them by doing things not just by studying. You can go to a course in Java or Leadership and feel good when you’re done but you don’t really know how to program or lead until you’ve done it. And that means you need projects feedback mentors coaches and lots of stretch assignments.

In a company this means lots of “learning by doing.” So no matter how good the L&D department is nobody really learns much until managers and career coaches help you “do” and “learn” on the job. And this has been the core of my research on Learning in the Flow of Work.

In my case I learn something every day. Yes every single day. I listen to others attempt to drive projects make decisions – and every day I learn something new. So I’m building “capability” all the time.

So how do you develop facilitate and support this process in a structured directed way? Enter the Capability Academy.

Defining A Capability Academy

Rather than build a course catalog or a “University” of training a Capability Academy is focused on… yes.. building capabilities. The two best examples of these are Sales Academies and Leadership Academies.

A Sales Academy is usually run by the head of sales (not the head of L&D) and there is a senior sales executive who runs it. He or she puts together all sorts of curricula programs simulations and ongoing events to make sure salespeople are always ready to sell. He or she probably looks at new hire training product training sales skills negotiation skills and all sorts of industry and solution skills.

Ericsson for example has built an entire 5G Academy for its sales and engineering teams. 5G is not just a stack of technologies: it’s new business models new application solutions and a whole new way of positioning what Ericsson does. So your Sales Academy has to include tenure-based programs assignments and even peer-based assessment. Cisco used to force sales leaders to be “credentialed” by their peers to reach a senior level.

Great leadership academies are similar. They aren’t just a few courses for managers or leaders. They include all sorts of external speakers industry education simulations case studies and self-assessment. And as anyone who runs leadership development knows the process is built on succession management developmental assignments and lots of job rotation. All that falls into the Academy structure.

Our Academy (The Josh Bersin Academy) is also a great example. We did start with a series of courses but then we added research assessments a capability model and now a whole set of Senior Faculty and developmental journeys. Soon we’ll be adding developmental assignments and all sorts of other activities for your HR organization. All with the goal of continuously building deeper relevant useful capabilities in the important work of human resources.

(Read about the HR Capability Project here.)

How Do You Get Started

As the research points out a Capability Academy is not a library of courses. It’s a capability-centric organization that should be led by a business leader not an L&D professional. When Capital One got started with cloud-based digital technologies they assigned the CIO to lead their Digital Academy. He worked with one of the senior L&D leaders to build out the curricula developmental assignments and investments in content.

When Cemex built its Safety Academy or Supply Chain Academy they partnered with the CEO and heads of operations. When Pepsi built its Finance Academy the CFO was the sponsor. You get the idea: this is your opportunity to make a strategic decision about what capabilities really matter and focus your attention in these areas.

You shouldn’t build a Capability Academy for everything. All companies need training in compliance diversity operations and management. These may or may not warrant an Academy structure. As I like to put it draw a 2X2 grid and figure out what capability areas drive competitive advantage for your company.

The following chart will help. This is an analysis I developed years ago when I wrote The Training Measurement Book and it still applies today. Look at the capability areas that are strategic (they drive competitive advantage) unique (they’re not just off-the-shelf topics) and urgent (if you don’t address them now your company won’t grow).

This 2X2 is a good exercise for any L&D or HR team. Take all your L&D programs from onboarding to DEI to compliance and see where they fit. And what you’ll find is that you can “outsource” a lot of the ones at the bottom left and bottom right and they may or may not justify an Academy. That leaves your budget to focus on the most strategic areas of all.

Long ago I spent a lot of time at Caterpillar and one of their most important capability areas was channel partners. They like many manufacturers make most of their money by training supporting and developing their resellers distributors and partners. So they have always had an “Academy” structure for channel sales and support.

Bottom Line: Skills Are Not The Whole Answer

I know everyone is interested in skills taxonomies and intelligent AI-based skills systems. And even if they worked perfectly all they’d do is recommend the “perfect training” for every employee at a given time. But would they build capabilities? Likely not. It’s the experience exposure coaching and feedback that help people grow. The Academy gives you the structure to do this well.

We have become quite experts at putting these strategies together. If you’d like some help figuring out your Capability Academy strategy please give us a call.

(Published 2021),"The British artist Damien Hirst best known for putting a shark in a tank of formaldehyde has gotten on the NFT bandwagon.

NFTs or nonfungible tokens rely on blockchain technology to designate an official copy of a piece of digital media that would otherwise be cheap or free. Mr. Hirst is selling a collection of 10000 NFTs each of which corresponds to a physical dot painting for $2000 each. A year from now the collectors of the series called “The Currency” will have to decide whether to keep the NFT or the painting; whichever one they don’t choose will be destroyed.

Is it better to keep the NFT or the physical artwork? Which will be the more valuable investment? It’s hard to know. Certain NFTs are fetching large sums of money but not all of them are. As with any new art form what happens over the next few years is hard to predict. And anyone investing in NFTs with an eye on earning investment-like returns needs to understand the risks.

The city was founded in the first century by the Romans who used its natural hot springs as a thermal spa. But a dip in those steaming waters in an elaborately engineered underground temple dedicated to Minerva goddess of healing is off limits to visitors who wander through the historic site today.

At the Cleveland Pools however you can once again take the plunge. This equally impressive water complex was built in 1815 and continuously used for bathing until 1984. Following a nearly £10-million restoration the complex believed to be the oldest surviving outdoor public swimming pool in the United Kingdom reopened to the public in the fall. Its main attraction is a large curvilinear pool originally reserved for male bathers who had been banned from swimming nude in the adjacent river.

Cleveland Pools can only be reached on foot through the scenic trails of a quiet residential cul-de-sac which contributes to its somewhat secret status. Travelling there takes you through layers of Saxon medieval and Tudor architecture and most notably neoclassical Palladian buildings constructed during the 18th century under the reign of George III. Accented with honey-coloured limestone pediments and Corinthian pilasters these landmarks give the city its distinctive glow even in the pouring rain.

The direct 90-minute train from London Paddington means that Bath population 100000 sees a significant influx of visitors particularly for weekend getaways. Many of those tourists come to town to experience the waters and the historic cityscape to follow in the literary footsteps of Mary Shelley (who wrote much of her landmark gothic Frankenstein while attending lectures in town) and Jane Austen (who lived here briefly) and to hop between filming locations of Netflix’s blockbuster Regency-era series Bridgerton. Lately the city is also becoming a destination for fans of a branch of contemporary British design that’s anchored in history.

Bath’s influx of weekenders also includes more than a few hen and stag parties which is why during my visit in October I opted to stay in Bathwick. It’s a quiet area on the opposite bank of the River Avon and only a 10-minute stroll across neoclassical Pulteney Bridge from the bustling city centre. I enjoyed coming and going along Great Pulteney Street a wide formal avenue flanked by the unspoiled Georgian architecture of luxurious terraced townhouses.

Open this photo in gallery: Holburne Museum Bath's first public art gallery and former home of Sir Thomas Holburne.

At its east end is the Holburne Museum. Doubling as the stately residence of Bridgerton’s formidable Lady Danbury in real life it’s the onetime home of Sir Thomas Holburne a lifelong collector of quirky miniatures old masters and objets d’art he later bequeathed to the city. A recent exhibition was devoted to painter Gwen John whose reputation only emerged out the imposing shadow of her artist brother Augustus and lover Auguste Rodin after her death in 1939.

Great Pulteney Street is only one of the city’s architectural set pieces. The Circus a round residential street of townhouses from 1754 is another masterpiece of graceful urban planning. Its streetscape overflows ornamentation in the forms of friezes decorative emblems and triglyphs. The curving Palladian façades of nearby Royal Crescent overlook the vast Royal Victoria Park lawn. Among them No. 1 is the city’s most prestigious address housing a museum styled entirely in the Georgian manner (and doubling as another Bridgerton backdrop the Featherington family’s abode).

The Assembly Rooms referenced by Austen was one of the legendary dance halls at the heart of aristocratic socializing in her day and it still drips with crystal chandeliers and ornate mouldings. During a visit you can practically hear the gossiping ghosts of socialites past. At the nearby Jane Austen Centre those ghosts are in fact real-life guides costumed in Regency garb who lead tours in character.

All this history – and occasional kitsch – forms the groundwork for the contemporary designers galleries and quirky shops that draw on the city’s heritage values. Nowhere is this more in evidence than at the influential design boutique Berdoulat. Based in Margaret’s Buildings a historic pedestrian street lined with independent design shops Berdoulat is Patrick Williams’s architectural design practice which specializes in period building restoration. It’s also the three-storey Georgian shopfront he co-founded with his wife Turkish and Bulgarian photographer Neri Williams.

The wood countertops brass scales and antique apothecary jars are heirlooms just as Berdoulat’s many tableware and interior accessory collaborations with local artisans will eventually become. From cutlery baskets by Bath’s Willow pottery to canelé-shaped ceiling fixtures by Devon ceramicist Feldspar all its pieces are designed in collaboration with regional makers. The simple refectory tables lipped bowls and oak egg racks highlight craft and epitomize beautility the latest buzzword for functional home essentials in modest materials.

As someone who thrills at the archaic terminology of estate interiors – think “boot rooms” “butler’s pantries” and anything featuring the word “scullery” – the new DeVOL Kitchens showroom tucked in the corner of a historic building block nearby is a twofold pleasure. The firm specializes in (and popularized) handmade kitchen furniture inspired by historic home aesthetics that fuse classic unfitted Georgian and farmhouse styles with modern conveniences. The copper worktops Shaker wainscotting aged brass taps slatted plate racks and fluted marble bib sinks of the three atmospheric showroom kitchens are swoon-worthy – and could easily have been plucked out of any of the high-ceilinged townhouses on the street.

Niche bookshop and publisher Persephone Books sits next door in the Edgar Buildings. It was established 25 years ago to excavate a more recent history: neglected works (mostly by women) from the mid-20th century. As much as I adore Austen Persephone is the reason I’ve come to Bath: a pilgrimage to the bookshop that has unearthed so many of my favourite reads. The publisher’s attention to design detail rivals that of its neighbours. The vestibule and fixtures are done up in the same signature dove grey as its books each with individual endpapers reproducing period textiles and wallpapers chosen to complement the material. A period upholstery fabric for example lines an edition of the once-forgotten 1938 charmer Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day by Winifred Watson that is Persephone’s perennial bestseller.

Among the cluster of well-curated art and antique shops up the hill Francis Gallery is set inside another of these heritage-listed Georgian townhouses with wood furnishings and plinths in tonal shades of ecru arranged like a living space. Korean-Canadian founder and director Rosa Park grew up in Vancouver. Prior to opening the gallery (which also has an outpost in Los Angeles) to present the work of emerging international artists she created Cereal an acclaimed indie magazine about travel and lifestyle. The space is as warm and understated as her magazine pages with diffused lighting like something out of a Hammershøi painting adding to the moodiness of the ghostly Krista Mezzadri monotype prints on show when I visited.

Retracing my steps to explore an area around the railway station I took the invigorating waters of a different kind at Bath Botanical Gin Distillery & Herbal Apothecary the passion project of medical herbalist Sue Mullett. As a one-woman operation its hours are limited but I stopped by at just the right time to sample the micro-distillery’s offerings of boozy small-batch tonics inspired by traditional apothecary tinctures. Mullett’s crisply refreshing No.1 Gin is the only authentically Bath-produced gin and every wax-sealed bottle comes out of the copper still that is the petite room’s centrepiece. It is yet another example of how Bath’s modern sense of craft and culture flourishes because of the reverence for the city’s history.

Text description provided by the architects. Jocheon is a small village on the northeastern coast of Jeju. It is a seaside village known as a great place to see the sunrise every day. To the north is the blue sea of Jocheon and freshwater springs from the ground near the beach. Jocheon has been a clean and abundant village with clean spring water which was used by the people for washing and drinking before the waterworks were installed. This plot of land silently watching over the sea is about 18 square meters in size and is on the boundary between the beach of Jocheon and the freshwater springs.

This was a place for the travelers to begin and end their day. So what did it have to offer? We focused on the element of ‘water’ as harbored by the beach of Jocheon. We wanted the most daily element to give the most non-daily experience in this space. ‘Taking a bath’ is a very simple and daily action yet a powerful ritual of rearranging one’s mind and relieving the physical and mental fatigue. The Chinese character for bath is 浴 (Yok).

It represents the pouring water and means to clean the wastes with the force of water flowing downwards. We planned this space to be a place for relaxing and recharging focusing on the acts of washing and wiping in a space filled with various forms of water such as pouring water gushing water still water gazing water and steam.

The Jocheon Yokjang is a small bath place consisting of 3 floors that are about 15 square meters each. The building was designed to be within 50 square meters without a parking area so that the yard can be used more widely and it is a private space for only 2 people. The 3rd floor is a bathing space with an ocean view and various washing experiences. The 2nd floor is the bedroom and the 1st floor is the kitchen. The vertical concrete building is only open on the sides that come in contact with nature.

Only the surfaces that accept the ocean view and light are open and all other surfaces are completely shut from the outer world. The concrete walls have wood grain patterns that hold the movement of light. Along the basalt wall is the entrance path that opens into the garden and through the garden is the inside of the house. The entrance path is long enough to heighten the immersion in the space and the unpredictable changes of the space diversify the experience.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWN1dC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9qZXNzaWNhLWJpZWwtMjAtcG91bmRzLWVwc29tLXNhbHQtbWV0LWdhbGEuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jessica Biel Soaked in 20 Lbs of Epsom Salt Before Met Gala,"Photo: ANGELA WEISS/AFP via Getty Images

There are lots of things that go into Met Gala prep. Kim Kardashian had to learn the art of breathing in a corset for example. If you’re Jessica Biel the night before the Met Gala was all about dumping more Epsom salt than anyone has ever needed into a bathtub. How much Epsom salt do you think that would be? A pound maybe? Two? Think bigger.

In a TikTok Biel shared that she would be spending the night before the Met Gala soaking in a bath filled with 20 pounds of Epsom salt. That’s five full bags of magnesium sulfate. Dr. Teal’s the brand used by Biel in the video recommends customers use “at least” two cups per bath to relax muscles and reduce inflammation. So technically she is following the instructions.

For scale the average 1-year-old weighs about 20 pounds. Why would anyone need a baby-size amount of Epsom salts in their bath? Biel did not explain her reasoning but kindly shared her routine. The actress said your bath should have “water as hot as you can take it.” Then she instructed you soak for 30 minutes then “drink tons of water” and “off to bed early.” Anyone who has ever taken an Epsom-salt bath knows that there’s no way you wouldn’t be off to bed early after soaking in that high of a concentration.

If you think that maybe 20 pounds of Epsom salt might fix everything for you think again. First of all that’s like a $25 bath. Second of all medical professionals don’t think it’s a good idea. Dr. T.N. Rekha Singh told Yahoo Life that Biel’s method could have negative side effects. “Overuse or excessively concentrated solutions can lead to dehydration salt imbalance or magnesium overdose” she told the website.

Long story short you don’t need more than two cups of Epsom salt to get the maximum amount of relaxation. Your muscles will still thank you and — I’m just guessing on this one — so will your pipes. (That much salt can’t be good for them right?)

It’ll hang there until the next time you need to towel off—unless it needs to be washed that is. But how often should you really change out your bath towel for a fresh one?

There’s a certain number of days to be mindful of before your towel becomes a breeding ground for bacteria. Plus using a fresh clean bath towel is not only good for your personal hygiene but for your overall health. Ahead find what experts have to say when it comes to how often you should change your bath towel.

This Is How Often You Should Change Out Your Bath Towel

According to Annie Chiu MD a board-certified dermatologist and founder of The Derm Institute there's a clear guidance on when to make the swap.

“Generally you should change your towels every three to four uses” she says. “This helps prevent the buildup of bacteria and odors.”

It’s important to stick to this clean towel schedule for a few reasons Chiu notes. Bacteria dead skin cells and excess oils from your skin can build up on wet towels. So when a dirty towel is used you run the risk of creating skin infections or exacerbating existing skin conditions like acne.

Factors That Affect When You Should Swap Out Your Towel

That said several factors can impact the length of time you keep a towel in your rotation.

How Smelly It Is

If a towel looks unclean or starts to smell before three uses you should change it sooner Chiu says.

How Often You Shower

On the flip side if you shower every day you might be able to use your towel a few more times before changing it.

How Much You Sweat

“However if your workout or job causes you to sweat a lot you should change your towel more frequently” she adds. “The same applies to those who live in humid climates—because towels may take longer to dry increasing the risk of bacterial growth and odor.”

Your Towel's Material

Your towel’s material can also come into play. Waffle weave towels for example tend to dry more quickly than typical terrycloth towels.

“Thanks to the waffle weave construction of our towels we have found that they do generally dry faster than a traditional cotton terry towel” explains Jason Gutierrez cofounder of textile company Geometry. “In our experience a quicker-drying towel lends itself to more uses between washes.”

Gutierrez estimates swapping out a waffle weave towel every seven to 10 days while also considering how often the towel is being used where and how it is stored in between uses and the humidity and temperature of the area where the towel is hung.

Pollutants in the Environment

“Factors such as exposure to pet dander smoke or outdoor pollutants can also affect towel cleanliness and may necessitate more frequent changes” say the product experts at bedding and linens company Cozy Earth.

When Should You Throw Away Towels?

After swapping towels in and out over a few years your bath towel may start to lose its softness fluff and absorbency. “If your towels no longer absorb water effectively and feel less soft and plush than they used to it may be time for replacements” say the experts at Cozy Earth. “Over time towels can lose their absorbency due to wear and tear or the buildup of detergent residue.”

Similarly if your towels are exposed to chlorine and sunlight that makes a difference in their longevity as do washing habits and how often you use them.

When properly cared for a typical towel's lifespan is about two years (less if they're heavily used more if they're mainly for display).

“Personally once my towel starts to show signs of wear such as fraying I know it has lived its life and it's time for a new one” says Gutierrez. “I have several Geometry waffle bath towels that have been in my towel rotation for years and are still going strong. They’re quite durable in terms of construction and functionality but like all textiles they do eventually wear out.”

Don't throw your towels away though! There's plenty you can do with them like donating them to animal shelters or turning them into cleaning rags.

BAX,Baxter International,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vbGF3LnN0YW5mb3JkLmVkdS9zdGFuZm9yZC1sYXd5ZXIvYXJ0aWNsZXMvcmVzcG9uZGluZy10by1jaGluYXMtc3RhdGUtY2FwaXRhbGlzbS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Responding to China's State Capitalism | Stanford Law School,"Total surrender. That’s what the New York Times reported the Chinese government expects of its business sector following Beijing’s recent signals not to resist government influence.

Curtis Milhaupt the William F. Baxter-Visa International Professor of Law at Stanford Law School has been researching China’s state capitalism for nearly a decade and worries that U.S. efforts to respond to its challenges have been ineffective. His new study detailed in the latest issue of the Journal of Legal Studies together with his publicly filed comments on a new U.S. law aimed at countering Beijing’s influence over Chinese firms accessing the U.S. capital market suggest why.

Milhaupt sees two main challenges: The first has to do with what the U.S. actually knows—and more importantly doesn’t know—about how much power the Chinese government and Communist Party exert over Chinese companies. The second concerns whether the United States alone can successfully manage China’s distinct form of capitalism.

“It’s important to recognize that the channels of party-state influence in the corporate sector are actually very complex and subject to some universal constraints such as agency problems and market discipline” says Milhaupt. His previous research has detailed the ownership structures of Chinese state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and has shown that the Chinese government has exercised less control over these firms than is often assumed. “But at the same time global regulatory systems never contemplated the partial fusion of political and economic interests we see in many Chinese companies.”

Milhaupt’s latest research—conducted with Lauren Yu-Hsin Lin an associate professor at City University of Hong Kong School of Law and graduate of Stanford’s JSD program—underscores both points.

In their study Milhaupt and Lin uncover evidence indicating that from 2015-18 some 90 percent of publicly traded Chinese SOEs have amended their articles of incorporation to give the Chinese Communist Party formal status in their operations. The amendments came in response to a 2015 policy requiring all SOEs to formalize and elevate the role of the party in their corporate governance.

Some of the adopted measures are purely symbolic but others highly substantive. Milhaupt and Lin for example find that 75 percent of the SOEs require their board of directors to consult with an internal Communist Party committee before making a major business decision. Sixty-six percent allow the committee to nominate directors and senior managers. (Virtually all organizations in China including corporations have internal Communist Party committees whose importance and function vary—from appointing personnel to addressing corruption to propagating political campaigns.)

“In these cases the party committee is above the board of directors as the highest decision-making body within the corporation” says Milhaupt. “To put it mildly these steps are inconsistent with globally-accepted governance principles” he says.

Underscoring the reach of the Communist Party beyond the state business sector the researchers also find that almost 6 percent of private firms with shares listed on China’s stock markets voluntarily adopted measures giving the party committee formal status and in some cases a governance role within the company.

These measures also have important U.S. policy implications. Case in point: draft Securities and Exchange Commission regulations implementing a newly-enacted federal law that aims to counter Beijing’s restrictions on how much financial information U.S.-listed Chinese companies disclose to American regulators. The interim regulations require a U.S.-listed foreign company that refuses an audit inspection to reveal any government ownership stake in its business the identities of Chinese Communist Party officials serving on its board and whether its articles of incorporation refer to the party’s constitution. Companies that do not comply for three consecutive years face delisting.

Milhaupt says in their current form these disclosure requirements are not likely to be very helpful to U.S. investors and regulators in understanding the degree of influence the Chinese government and Communist Party exert over a given company. For example virtually every executive of a Chinese SOE is a member of the Communist Party. And as Milhaupt’s recent research indicates references to the party constitution are often symbolic and can be found in virtually all SOE charters and some private company charters as well.

A more effective approach says Milhaupt would be to require U.S.-listed Chinese companies to specify their board members’ current and past ranks within the Chinese government and/or the Communist Party whether they also serve on the internal party committee and the actual role of the party committee in the company’s governance.

“The law and implementing regulations seem to betray a lack of understanding about how Chinese firms are actually influenced by the Chinese government and Communist Party” says Milhaupt who outlined this and other suggested fixes in a public comment letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission in response to the draft regulations it issued this spring.

Even so Milhaupt acknowledges that China’s state capitalism poses challenges to a world order that the United States can’t address effectively on its own. He points out that threatening to delist Chinese firms from U.S. stock exchanges for example may be ineffective given that capital markets are global and Beijing wants these firms to list their shares in the mainland or Hong Kong in any event.

“We risk entering into a race to the bottom with China through ad hoc retaliatory measures that in the end are likely to be symbolic and possibly even counterproductive” says Milhaupt who is also a Senior Fellow by courtesy at Stanford’s Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies. “There needs to be a coalition of western governments and investors and a major rethinking of global regulatory systems to effectively respond to China’s distinctive form of capitalism.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vdHJhaWxlcnNmcm9taGVsbC5jb20vbWFzdGVyLW9mLXRoZS13b3JsZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Master of the World,"One of Jules Verne’s most popular sci-fi fantasies got the big screen treatment from American-International which hopped on the Verne bandwagon that raked in big $$ for Disney and others. A production challenge given a minimum of resources the colorful show is still admired for Vincent Price’s performance as Robur the Conqueror a mad terrorist. Charles Bronson also gets high marks as the proto- G-Man dispatched to put an end to Robur’s Albatross an aerial ‘weapon of mass destruction.’ We also fell in love with art director Daniel Haller’s magnificent design for the airship — even if the special visual effects no longer seem as special as they should have been.

Written by Richard Matheson from Master of the World and Robur the Conqueror by Jules Verne

Directed by William Witney

This 100% childhood wonder movie favorite grabbed my attention from the get-go. I first became aware of it when I was taken to a downtown Honolulu matinee of Walt Disney’s Sleeping Beauty — across the street was a marquee proclaiming a great new movie from Jules Verne on whom I was already keen through Classics Illustrated comics. I didn’t learn what the movie was about for several months when it came to the Hickam Air Force Base theater in all its glory. The show had EVERYTHING a nine-year old wanted to see that’s for sure. It was the first time I saw Vincent Price on a screen although I’d stared at the posters for his ‘adult’ movies House on Haunted Hill The Tingler and The Bat.

New Screen Actors Guild rules for 1960 forbade negotiated buy-outs for actors a residuals requirement that largely put an end to seventy-minute B&W quickies made on a shoestring and off the books. American-International Pictures had to change their game plan. When they could they continued to double-bill obscure horror and fantasy films often cheaply-bought foreign productions. But the company also began producing mid-range features intended to compete with the majors at the top of a theatrical bill. They rolled the dice on Roger Corman’s more expensive Edgar Allan Poe movie House of Usher in color and Panavision.

A.I.P.’s James H. Nicholson soon took a stab at a full-scale epic with Master of the World  an excellent choice to crash the then-hot Jules Verne craze. With their eye on the millions made by Walt Disney Michael Todd and Charles Brackett’s lavish Verne adaptations Nicholson fixated on the Verne book Robur the Conqueror and cribbed the title from the author’s later Master of the World. Not only was Verne’s story similar to his classic 20000 Leagues Under the Sea — it substitutes an airship for a submarine — screenwriter Richard Matheson ‘borrows’ Captain Nemo’s anti-war anti-munitions slant. The parallels are so close that one wonders if Disney’s attorneys considered a lawsuit. Master of the World bears a winning concept but suffers greatly from its relatively miniscule budget — A.I.P. just couldn’t afford the special effects needed to properly tell the story.

In 1848 ‘government agent’ John Strock (Charles Bronson) accompanies a deputation from the Weldon Airship Society to investigate strange sights and sounds emanating from a mountain called The Great Eyrie. Their flimsy balloon is shot down and the four aeronauts awaken intact but confused in what seems to be the cabin of a ship. It turns out that they are the prisoners of the visionary inventor & anti-war fanatic Robur (Vincent Price) a stateless rebel who intends to disarm the world’s nations by threatening them with utter destruction. His persuader is the Albatross an enormous flying machine powered by a newly-discovered electrical force. The Albatross looks like a blimp but is actually a giant helicopter kept aloft by banks of rotors.

Robur drops leaflets stating his demands and demonstrates his power by sinking a warship. He becomes furious at learning that one of his ‘guests’ is the Yankee arms manufacturer Prudent (Henry Hull). Prudent’s hotheaded associate Philip Evans (David Frankham) foolishly provokes Robur much to the consternation of his fiancée Dorothy Prudent’s daughter (Mary Webster). Strock and Dorothy regard their captor not as a madman but a misguided idealist. Meanwhile Robur proceeds to bomb British ships in the Thames and intercedes in a tribal battle in North Africa. Only Strock keeps a cool head. He admires Robur’s pacifist ideals yet concludes that the Albatross must be destroyed.

American-International responded to their new production challenge by switching to color for in-house work but continuing to make their films on the cheap. Their director of choice was William Witney a maker of mostly anonymous westerns who owed the studio a movie. The best word for Witney’s work is ‘efficient.’ He shoots his scenes all with one lens from shoulder height. Daniel Haller’s sets for the interior of the Albatross are imaginative but the static camera and the angles chosen often make us feel we’re watching a TV show.

The actors must cope with a script that’s 70% exposition and 30% awkward dramatic confrontations. David Frankham’s Philip takes offense at everything said by Robur and Strock — we wonder why the others don’t vote to push the insufferable Phillip over the side. Henry Hull tries to enliven scenes by overacting blowing the film’s vaguely pacifist message. His arguments about propellers on balloons (straight from Verne’s book) sound foolish as if meant to mirror the petty argument about which end of an egg to open in Gulliver’s Travels. Mary Webster’s Dorothy serves mostly as a romantic bystander leaving Vincent Price’s volatile Robur and Charles Bronson’s cool-headed John Strock to give the movie some grit and dynamism.

Price’s Robur is a devout Bible reader yet also volatile and vindictive when his pride is hurt veering between gentility and mania. At one point he tortures Philip by dangling him beneath the ship at the end of a long rope but shouts in remorse after forgetting to pull the man up again. Like the abolitionist John Brown he’s a self-contradictory madman talking like a peace dove and then throwing himself into pitched battles. As a pacifist Robur earns poor marks; he should have done remedial work in diplomacy or simple psychology. Captain Nemo just let his hatred be his guide and sank munitions ships with abandon. Robur seriously expects nations to capitulate to his ranting ultimatums. What makes him think an aerial barrage would stop two warring tribes from fighting? Vincent Price’s authoritative delivery — no cackling or fruity eye rolling — gives life and authority to Robur’s selfrighteous tantrums. As with James Mason’s Nemo we’re always on Robur’s side. May their ghosts continue sinking warships forever.

Charles Bronson didn’t leap to full star status after The Magnificent Seven but he did get a boost to more prestigious roles in movies bigger than Roger Corman’s Machine Gun Kelly. Bronson has more conventional dialogue lines in this movie than in all his Death Wish movies put together. He shines just by maintaining an even strain and talking calm sense. Bronson owns the action hero scenes outright and easily slings a man his own size over his shoulder. His character even seems to get the girl — what could go wrong?

Not too many complaints were heard for Master of the World’s special effects. Daniel Haller’s design for the Albatross is handsome and clever a semi-credible “Clipper of the Clouds” predicting a future of powerful airships. But Ray Mercer and Project Unlimited had to create the film’s visual effects on far too small a scale. The excellent Albatross model is filmed in dull angles in front of a rear projection (RP) screen. The aerial scenery plates for these effects are haphazard at best — ragged pans of the horizon and unstable views of clouds and waves. On a big screen the Albatross was a bit more impressive but it mostly looks like a toy. (The three images above enlarge.)

The live-action aerial views are also accomplished with rear-projection and the process plate scenes to be rear-projected are not the best. A shot supposedly leaving the Eastern coast of America depicts an arid seashore. ‘Ireland’ looks like the only green field a pilot could find in Southern California. In the film’s least-effective effects The Albatross is RP-inserted into grainy stock shots of model boats not all of them in color. ‘London’ consists of textless title backgrounds from Laurence Olivier’s Henry V that depict an Elizabethan-period Thames complete with a large Globe Theater. Representing Africa is faded Technicolor footage of the Fuzzy-Wuzzy battle from Korda’s The Four Feathers. None of this is at all convincing as the Albatross never seems connected to the movie scenes of the battle below.

Daniel Haller’s wheelhouse set looks the best; with the view through its windows it had to ‘live’ on a rear-projection stage. There’s only one locked-down angle so it takes Price’s commitment to the role to make us believe that we’re flying. Haller adds what look like stained-glass window panes expressing Robur’s religious commitment. The HD image reveals that the stained glass designs are hastily painted-on.

Composer Les Baxter worked overtime on his pretty music score lending needed excitement to actions that occur off-screen. The main theme has always sounded derivative of the Borodin-adapted pop song Stranger in Paradise. Elsewhere Baxter fills the show with busy cues doing what he can with the film’s weak comedy relief scenes. The cook Topage (Vito Scotti) works in an impractical aerial kitchen forever being reduced to chaos like Lucille Ball trying to cook in the gyrating travel trailer in Minnelli’s The Long Long Trailer yuk yuk. The ten year-olds I saw the film with thought it very funny.

Robur’s main man at the tiller wheel is Richard Harrison who soon followed other California musclemen to Rome to play in sword ‘n’ sandal epics and spaghetti westerns. He does without a shirt in this film quite a bit too. Robur’s multinational crew goes Disney one further by being multiracial as well but all hands appear to be devout Christians.

Disney’s daringly radical 20000 Leagues makes Jules Verne’s Captain Nemo’s into a clear-cut terrorist hero striking back against ‘that hated nation.’ Richard Matheson’s script fumbles its political stance. Prudent and Phillip’s anti-Robur tantrums don’t put them in a positive light but Master doesn’t make an anti-colonial statement — Robur just thinks he can extort compliance from the world and make nations give up war the way someone might give up smoking or drinking. John Strock has the final word simply stating that he admires Robur’s ideals but not his methods. Robur is a lot like a typical mad movie scientist just another misdirected maniac that needs putting down.

Tie-in comics and photo-novels for Master proliferated in several languages. I read the pocketbook tie-in which was actually a reprint of Robur the Conqueror. In Verne’s original book the Albatross was never posited as an Instrument of Mass Destruction a convincer to demand obedience from stubborn nations. On its own the marvelous flying machine wouldn’t make a particularly formidable weapon especially not when Robur flies so low that everything can shoot at him.

But little kids (this writer among them) hardly noticed these flaws. We were grateful for any show that catered to our adolescent interests. The Dell tie-in comic book adaptation sported visuals more impressive than anything the movie had to offer ( top image: ↑).

The show opened in New York on September 15 1961 on a double bill with Herman Cohen’s Konga. The ads touted non-existent ‘MagnaColor;’ UK posters proclaim Technicolor. When it finally arrived on television I was profoundly disappointed to find that most shots of the flying machine looked well feeble. But there’s always Vincent Price’s haughty performance Charles Bronson’s stone-faced tough guy and the frequently impressive music score. This is one movie epic that merits a lavish remake.

The KL Studio Classics Blu-ray of Master of the World is an excellent transfer of a film that hasn’t always looked terrific. It’s essentially the same as Shout! Factory’s 2016 Blu-ray release with the addition of a few hours of digital clean-up: among other things changeover cues have been removed. (image from an earlier disc → )

The scan can only do so much with variable-quality RP background plates and old-movie stock shots that range from faded Technicolor to tinted B&W. The optical for the main title sequence has always been a mess of fine scratches that almost look like duplicated workprint material. The only movie I’ve seen with a more damaged-looking main title optical is The Day of the Triffids.

The orchestral soundtrack is quite nice. Les Baxter tried hard to deliver an epic romantic score. His main theme definitely ups the Albatross’s magnificence quotient. The apparent model is Victor Young’s score for Around the World in Eighty Days with frequent changes in music style. Baxter’s score was released on a stereo LP and a 1990s laserdisc retained the film’s original stereophonic mix. I don’t know how many theatrical engagements were in stereo but the disc carries both a mono and a 2-channel stereo track.

As with other presentations after the final fade-out we hear the film’s two tie-in songs over black that we first heard on a 1990s laserdisc: “Come Dance With Me” and “Master of the World” with jaunty romantic lyrics like “A man is master of the world when he is loved.” These apparently weren’t tacked on for home video but served as exit music for original theatrical engagements.

That means that the film’s 102 min. 53 sec. running time has been slightly padded. Without the two songs that serve as exit music and the opening’s ‘funny aviation’ montage — it’s fully disposable — the body of the show is really seven minutes shorter.

Kino repeats older extras and adds one of its own. An earlier commentary gives us actor David Frankham in conversation with Jonathan David Dixon. At age 89 Frankham is delighted to tell the story of his three films with Vincent Price. He was hired for this one at the last moment because Mark Damon took a job in Europe and Price recommended him from their experience together on Return of the Fly. Frankham predictably calls Price a nice guy and it’s good to hear about the actor from a fresh spokesman. He says that the production schedule was three weeks.

Also held over from previous releases is a 72-minute documentary that allows author Richard Matheson to speak his mind. Matheson has a lot to say about his career his fellow writer Charles Beaumont and the movie business in general; he concludes with a speech about spiritualism.

A number of trailers are included; some online accounts list a pair of image galleries that I didn’t see in the menu. As with other new Kino special editions the disc comes in a slip-sleeve cover.

Kino’s new commentary is from Tom Weaver whose ever-more elaborate gab-tracks are turning into radio productions with guest experts sound effects and recitations of screenplay scenes not filmed. We hear reenactments of interviews with Richard Matheson William Witney Les Baxter David Frankham and Loretta Nicholson and new audio recordings give us Price biographer Lucy Chase Williams writer Richard Heft and music expert David Schechter. The commentators note Vincent Price’s ‘outrageous’ bushy eyebrows the first time I’ve ever heard a complaint about Robur’s facial hair.

Much of the track is devoted to the original Verne books and how Richard Matheson reinterpreted them for the screen; Ms. Williams handles Price anecdotes and Schecter talks at length about a film score for which he has little good to say. Tom points out A.I.P. executive relatives among the bit part players and criticizes every special effect and visual choice (why not an iris-out in a movie set in 1848?). Taken from his exhaustive interviews Tom relates more anecdotes from the filming agrees with his co-hosts that Charles Bronson was terminally unfriendly and uses dueling interviews to create a heated dispute between Matheson and director Witney. But then James H. Nicholson receives uncritical glowing praise.

When listing Jules Verne film adaptations Tom makes no mention of the Czech Karel Zeman films which are some of the best — especially Vynález Skázy. Tom slams the movie all the way through and then expresses great affection for it as he signs off. That’s an honest reaction. I do the same here too except that actually having seen Master of the World as a small fry back in the day I can attest that it only disappointed at the very end when I was sad that it was over. I guess we were easy to please back then.

There are heavy expectations on Kaizer Chiefs' new signings to see if they would be able to turn around the fortunes of the club and help deliver the first major title since 2015.

Goal takes a look at the player ages and if they have already reached the peak of their careers so far based on previous and current form.

Of the new signings only Kgaogelo Sekgota and Sibusiso Mabiliso are below the age of 25 while some are nearing 30 and Sifiso Hlanti is 31.

Coach Stuart Baxter who recently returned to the club is known for his trust in older players.

When he left Amakhosi in 2015 at the end of his first stint with the club Baxter left a number of aging players behind who had helped him deliver two Premier Soccer League titles while some were beyond their best days.

After having spent the majority of his career in his home country playing for the likes of Ajax Capetown and Mamelodi Sundowns Dolly earned his move to Europe in 2017.

The now 28-year-old signed for Ligue 1 outfit Montpellier but a series of injuries prevented him from fulfilling his full potential abroad.

In four years he’s made just 64 appearances scoring just once and providing three assists across all competitions along the way.

As his contract expired earlier this month Dolly has been linked with a return back to Africa through Cairo giants Al Ahly especially after head coach Mosimane hinted at a potential South African signing at the Reds.

According to South African news outlet SoccerLaduma Dolly has received a lucrative offer from an unnamed North African club.

The report added also that Al Ahly will be competing against Kaizer Chiefs over the signing of Dolly as rumor has it that Stuart Baxter asked for the international winger by name.

The 28-year-old forward was part of Mosimane’s squad that won the CAF Champions League with Mamelodi Sundowns back in 2016.

His last season with the French outfit wasn’t very successful as he made just 21 appearances in which he provided one assist and failed to score any goals.

Keagan isn’t the only name that’s currently on Al Ahly’s radar Soufiane Rahimi Raja Casablanca’s star and Simba’s Luís Miquissone are strong candidates to join the Reds during the summer transfers window.",,,

Amazon's Jeff Bezos and Virgin's Richard Branson blasted themselves into space this month while SpaceX CEO Elon Musk's grand vision is colonizing Mars. Warren Buffett doesn't share his fellow billionaires' passion for interstellar travel — he ruled out leaving Earth 25 years ago.

Buffett — who made his fortune investing in staid companies like Coca-Cola and Gillette — takes the same approach to fast-changing businesses and industries as he does to extraterrestrial voyages he said in his 1996 letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders.

""As investors our reaction to a fermenting industry is much like our attitude toward space exploration: We applaud the endeavor but prefer to skip the ride"" Buffett said.

The 90-year-old investor clearly has zero interest in planning a trip to space. However he found it a useful analogy to underscore the problem of a ballooning global population on a planet with limited resources during Berkshire's shareholder meeting in 2002.

""If you were going to go on a spaceship for a hundred years and you knew in the back of the spaceship there were a lot of provisions but you didn't know exactly how much — in terms of filling the front of the spaceship with a given number of people you would probably err on the low side"" Buffett said.

The Berkshire chief argued that if the exact amount of provisions and the precise timing of the spaceship's return were unclear it would make sense to be conservative with passenger numbers and reduce the risk of mass starvation.

""We are in a vehicle called Earth"" Buffett continued. ""We don't know its carrying capacity. We have learned that it's a lot larger than might have been thought by Malthus or somebody a few hundred years ago but that doesn't mean it's infinite at all.""

Buffett returned to the subject of space at Berkshire's annual meeting this year. When an audience member asked if Berkshire would insure Musk's mission to Mars the investor quipped that he would charge a lower premium if the Tesla CEO was on the spaceship.

""It's so important to get vaccinated even if you're young and healthy and not at risk. Vaccines help everyone. Just because you're not particularly at risk doesn't mean that people close to you aren't"" she said in the video.

Throughout her conservatorship lawsuit drama there’s no doubt that all eyes have been on Spears — and her social media posts. And as her battle for independence and control over her own life continues it looks like Spears is celebrating her small victories and letting it all out on social media…literally. In her latest Instagram post Spears posed topless and we kind of love how much she’s celebrating her body. She looks strong and proud!

Spears shared the photo in which she’s wearing nothing but a tiny pair of unzipped jean shorts and covering her chest with her hands to Instagram —and she looked stunning as ever. When Spears was recently granted the ability to choose her own lawyer it seems like her Instagram posts started to reflect the small gain in freedom she earned and she’s shared much of what she’s feeling in posts with long captions. But this post — ell let’s just say the photo was worth 1000 words. No caption is needed — just a simple emoji.

Not surprisingly fans are loving this new open and honest Britney. One wrote “OUR GIRL BRITNEY IS BACK!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥. YALL FORGOT ABOUT THE 2001- 2004 BRITNEY? LET HER REMIND YOU 🔥🔥🔥.” Even Paris Hilton had something to say about it commenting with her iconic phrase “That’s hot 😍🔥”

For those who have been waiting for the possible drops on selected retail shops here's the perfect opportunity that you should not miss.

Recently Best Buy has surprised customers with its PS5 restocks. On July 22 Walmart also released supplies for the next-gen consoles.

Scalpers are still everywhere that's why restock insider Matt Swider reminds all the buyers to stick with his tweets. His posts have already helped many people to get their PS5s ahead of a possible restock.

PS5 Restock Updates: What Happened So Far This Week

From what PS5 tracker Swider mentioned in his tweet GameStop could join the restock trend next week. Many retailers would soon open for the fans who miss the PS5 purchase last time.

Best Buy PS5 Restock

Best Buy opened its slots for PS5 consoles on Friday July 23. Before that the retailer released restocks on July 14 at 2:247 PM EDT.

Although the shop randomly unveils supplies you could check the site per week for a potential drop.

The only problem for Best Buy is its inconsistent schedule. While some people said that they easily ordered from the stores others dealt with the problem of slow page loading. It took them 15 minutes to enter the selling page only to end up knowing that the stocks were already sold out in a few minutes.

Walmart PS5 Restock

Swider predicted that the restock for Walmart would happen on July 22. It turned out to be accurate as the console suddenly appeared in the shop on the said date. You could regularly visit the website if you want a heads-up for this retailer.

On July 1 Walmart held a minor restock for PS5. 16 days later it staged another wave of supplies for its major restock event.

During the recent restock the only available console was the PS5 Disc. Back in June Walmart shocked the fans when it offered a free PS5 digital upgrade for those who bought the console version for $400.

Target PS5 Restock

The last time that Target announced its PS5 restock was on July 19 at 3 PM EDT. Usually the shop releases consoles on either Wednesday or Thursday. Watch out from 7 AM to 8 AM if you want to purchase a PS5 from this store.

Most probably Target will reveal restocks next week according to sources.

Amazon PS5 Restock

The common pattern for Amazon when releasing PS5 is rather unpredictable. Since the shop has been reportedly dropping the next-gen consoles on either day or night you should always check Swider's announcement about Amazon. T

he big retailer is also fond of throwing supplies once a month so don't expect frequent supplies from this shop.

With that Swider expected that the next Amazon restock will happen next month. However the latest news pointed out that Amazon had stocks on July 21 so it's unclear whether we could see another batch of consoles in August or not.

Sony Direct PS5 Restock

According to TechRadar's report the pattern might be unpredictable for Sony Direct since it used to release restocks twice a month. The last time it held an email invite was on July 19.

Usually Sony makes use of a virtual queue system for everyone. Apart from that there was another queue for people who have received email invites from the shop.

GameStop PS5 Restock

We spotted GameStop PS5 restocks last July 16 t 11 AM EDT. It's pretty common for this shop to have a weekly release for the console usually the PS5 bundles.

Next week we could anticipate GameStop to drop consoles. Our tip? Try to stick with the restock date of every 7 to 15 days for this retailer.

Laptops tablets backpacks and storage drives are some of the gadgets that students (or parents) should invest in as they enter a new term. This year given the shift to remote learning gadgets like webcams and mice are more important than ever.

Combing through products can be a frustrating time-intensive process. Don't worry though we've done the hard work for you with our category best pages. In this guide I'll highlight the top products in each category and direct you to our broader rankings so you can buy the perfect gadget for your needs. Below is a list of the best back-to-school gadgets for everyone whether you're a parent buying for an elementary school student or are a teenager getting ready for college.

Laptop

Dell XPS 13

Best back-to-school laptop: Dell XPS 13 (Image credit: Laptop Mag)

The perennial top pick for Windows 10 (and soon Windows 11) users the Dell XPS 13 is the ultimate ultraportable laptop. Its gorgeous aluminum chassis will attract the attention of your peers and it's portable enough to easily slip into a handbag or backpack. The edge-to-edge bezels a design trend championed by the XPS years ago draw your eyes toward the 13.4-inch display and helps in reducing the chassis' footprint.

Speaking of the display the 13.4-inch 1080p panel on our test unit was bright and vivid so you can enjoy watching Netflix in your dorm after a long day of studying (right?!). Performance is excellent thanks to the latest 11th Gen Intel CPUs and the graphics are good enough for lightweight gaming (but a gaming laptop or eGPU is recommended for gamers). Also the keyboard is comfy so you can bang out a lengthy report while in a library without needing an external one. Limited port selection is a major drawback of the XPS 13 so consider buying a USB-C hub for your peripherals (and a hardwired Ethernet connection).

Tablet

Apple iPad Air

Best back-to-school tablet: Apple iPad Air (Image credit: Laptop Mag)

You don't need to be an iPhone or Mac owner to enjoy the iPad Air which is undisputedly the best consumer tablet on the market. It has a sleek design with thin bezels fast performance from its A14 Bionic processor and a large 10.9-inch display that is great for viewing videos or movies. Moreover the Air can be paired with the Magic Keyboard so you can write reports do online lessons or chat with the friends and family you're missing while in college.

Better yet the iPad Air has a nifty fingerprint sensor and the 10.5 hours of battery life with USB-C charging means you won't be reaching for the cord very often. The Air is even great for blasting tunes in your dorm as the speakers sound better than you would expect from a tablet. There are a few things to consider when buying the iPad Air such as the cost of accessories and additional storage (consider the 10-inch iPad if these put the Air out of your price range) but if you have the extra cash the iPad Air is as good as it gets.

It's expensive yes but you get fantastic balanced sound and an extremely comfortable fit thanks to the cushy leatherette ear pads. I've listened to these for hours on end without any fatigue. Better yet the Bose 700 has excellent mics so friends or family can hear you clearly — no need to remove the headphones and use your phone. And about the price — while they retail for $400 you can often find them for $300.

Webcam

Logitech HD Webcam C920

Cheap? Yes. Sharp? Yes. Actually available to buy? It is! The Logitech HD Webcam C920 is the best webcam and rather regrettably has been for the past decade or so! Yes there are 4K webcams but those aren't worth the extra cost. Instead spend about $70 on the tried-and-true C920. I've personally been using the webcam on my XPS 15 (an older model with a nosecam) for the past 3 years and the picture quality is a massive upgrade from any integrated webcam on the market.

Tiny easy to pack in the smallest compartment of your backpack (like the Herschel) and filled with ports the Dell DA300 6-in-1 USB-C Hub satisfies all connectivity needs. Despite weighing less than 3 ounces the DA300 has an HDMI DisplayPort VGA input Ethernet USB-C and USB-A.

Buying a laptop with a large storage drive means you can store more documents photos apps and games. However storage upgrades are costly and sometimes you want to keep your sensitive data backed up. That's where the Samsung T7 Portable SSD comes in. It's small fast and durable. More specifically it provides 1050 MB/S transfer rates and boasts thermal protection against overheating. It has a shock-resistant chassis that can withstand a 6-foot drop and the vibrant colors mean you can customize it to your personality. Oh and the SSD is backed by Samsung's three-year warranty. Just keep in mind your laptop needs a USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 port.

The former's PlayStation Summer Sale runs through August 18—with Sony promising a second batch of discounts arriving on August 4—while the latter's Xbox Ultimate Game Sale will last through August 5.

These are not the first sweeping sales each company has run on its digital shops this summer but as before the new promotions discount several hundred games across last- and current-gen consoles (plus a few PC games  in Microsoft's case). Also like before most of the offers advertised in each sale aren't great deals either because the game in question is lackluster or because the discount isn't much lower than the street price we've seen in recent months.

So as we like to do with the Dealmaster we've looked through the entirety of Sony's and Microsoft's selections so you don't have to picking out the genuine deals along the way.

You can look through our full roundup below but we'll shout out a few highlights first. On the PlayStation side the gorgeous PS5 remake of the all-time great action-RPG Demon's Souls which we called a ""must-buy"" for PS5 owners is down to a joint-low of $50  as is the hardcore sci-fi roguelike Returnal  which launched in April. Both games typically retail for $70. (We'll also note that the latter suffered from some harsh glitches and game crashes at launch but recent patches have helped rectify those issues in the time since.)

Beyond those there are a handful of notable PS4 discounts happening alongside Sony's summer sale that aren't a part of the sale itself. Those include the open-world samurai adventure Ghost of Tsushima for $30 which is $10 below its usual price over the past few months and the stealth-action zombie drama The Last of Us Part II for $20 which is a new low . Both of those made our best games of 2020 list.

Over on the Xbox side it's worth remembering that many of the highlights are also included in Microsoft's Xbox Game Pass Ultimate service which goes for $15 a month. But if you'd rather own your copy—insofar as you can ""own"" a digital product—the sale includes Halo: The Master Chief Collection for $30  which matches the lowest it's been on PC and falls about $10 lower than the co-op-friendly collection's usual price on Xbox. The next-gen edition of the supernatural shooter Control  our 2019 game of the year  is down to a joint-low of $20  while a bundle that pairs both of the excellent 2D platformers in the Ori series is half off at $17.49

Almost the entire Yakuza series is deeply discounted too while single-player gems Titanfall 2 and The Witcher 3 are down to $3 and $10 respectively. And the tactical dodgeball game Knockout City which our review deemed ""the best team-deathmatch game we've played in years"" is down to $13 from its standard price of $20.

There are plenty more deals on games besides those however including good deals on 2021 games like Mass Effect: Legendary Edition and Hitman 3  excellent indies like Disco Elysium  Kentucky Route Zero and Lonely Mountains: Downhill  and much more. If you have more room on your backlog you can check out all of our top picks below.

Two first-half goals from Conor Lehane and one each for Cormac Beausag and Seán O’Meara gave the Magpies a 4-6 to 1-10 lead at the break Mark O’Keeffe with the goal for the Blackrock.

Ger O’Regan bagged a second goal for the city side after the break but Midleton looked to have done enough to secure safe passage to the final as they led by 4-16 to 2-14 as the game entered injury time.

However Alan O’Callaghan Tadhg Deasy and O’Regan pounced for three more majors for Blackrock but Midleton’s greater ability to split the posts saw them emerge victorious by 4-20 to 5-14.

In the final they will play Sarsfields after the East Cork side had a comfortable victory over a depleted St Finbarr’s in Riverstown.

Sars led by 2-18 to 0-7 at the break Aaron Myers and Liam Healy with the goals while another goal from Myers after the break saw them ease to a 3-26 to 2-9 victory. Glenn O’Connor and Ian Lordan found the net for the Barrs.

In League 2 Brian Ramsey was the star performer for Erin’s Own as they booked their place in the decider with a 0-22 to 2-15 win over Ballymartle. The Imokilly side led by 0-14 to 1-5 at the break with James O’Flynn dominant at centre-back while Darren McCarthy found the net for the Carrigdhoun outfit.

Ballymartle had the better of the second half with Jack Dwyer finding the net but Ramsey’s seven-point haul proved to be the difference for the winners.

They await the winners of Newtownshandrum and Kanturk in the final.

In League 3 Courcey Rovers progressed to the final after they defeated their old rivals Ballinhassig by 1-18 to 1-14 Jerry O’Neill with their all-important major. They will play Charleville in the final after last year’s Senior A champions defeated Cloyne by 0-18 to 0-8.

There'll be 3500 fans at the LIT Gaelic Grounds in Limerick for what could well prove a summer classic as the Munster rivals look to march on.

And after Waterford and Galway played out a cracker in Thurles the winner will join the Deise in the quarter-finals as they face either Tipperary or Dublin.

Tactics have been on the fans' lips as many speculate how Clare's 'wall' defence can cope with a Rebel attack that has scored goals for fun.

Clare's defensive approach severely limited Wexford during phases as a packed out middle third presented problems for Davy Fitzgerald's side as they looked to work it through the lines.

Gray’s fortune still trails that of Blackstone Chairman CEO & Co-Founder Stephen A. Schwarzman who’s worth $33.2 billion.

Blackstone’s shares have risen about 12% this week and 72% since the beginning of the year. The increase in share price has pushed Blackstone’s total market value to $134 billion or about $2 billion more than that of Goldman Sachs Group Inc.

The hotel family’s net worths – ranked,"The story behind their wealth is as fascinating as the people themselves. Barron Hilton Paris and Nicky’s uber-rich grandfather was chairman of the board and president and CEO of the company and in 2007 sold Hilton Hotels to the Blackstone Group for US$26 billion.

Whether it’s the famous Hilton hotel brand the OG influencer and reality star-turned-businesswoman Paris Hilton or Kyle and co on The Real Housewives it’s hard to escape the influence and magnitude of the Hilton family empire. Let’s not forget even Kim Kardashian started off as Paris’ assistant.

However when he passed away in 2019 he left most of his fortune to charity. In fact he left just 3 per cent of his wealth to his eight children 15 grandchildren and four great-grandchildren – including Paris Nicky and co.

The other 97 per cent went to the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation honouring his father’s wishes taking the family charity’s endowment from US$2.9 billion to US$6.3 billion.

So with the bulk of the Hilton family fortune out of the picture who is left with what and who earned their own empires? Here’s how rich the Hiltons (and Richards siblings) really are ...

Rick 65 and Kathy Hilton 62

Estimated net worth: US$350 million

As the parents of Paris Hilton close friends of former US president Donald Trump and even Michael Jackson  Rick and Kathy Hilton are the stalwarts of the Hilton family empire.

And they’ve got the bank balance to prove it. According to Celebrity Net Worth Rick and Kathy’s combined net worth is an estimated US$350 million making Kathy by far the richest cast member to ever appear on The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.

They may have missed out on the Hilton family billions but the couple certainly aren’t crying over spilled milk. These days Rick is the chairman and co-founder of Hilton & Hyland a real estate brokerage firm based in Beverly Hills. Kathy on the other hand is the ultimate Hilton housewife. As a former actress she now focuses on philanthropy sleeping in and living her best life (RHOBH viewers will know exactly what we’re talking about).

While Rick has always preferred to remain out of the spotlight Kathy’s recent appearance on RHOBH has given us a rare insight into their OTT and somewhat kooky luxury lives. And we can’t get enough of it.

Paris Hilton 40

Estimated net worth: US$300 million

Paris Hilton. Photo: @parishilton/Instagram

Love her or hate her one thing is for sure – Paris Hilton’s “dumb blonde” party girl image initially duped us all. As of 2021 Paris’ net worth is estimated to be US$300 million which means she’s fast catching up to her wealthy parents.

A big chunk of her income comes from her various retail businesses which include over 50 stores and 19 product lines internationally that have generated over US$4 billion in sales.

And while she’s definitely calmed down a lot since her mid-noughties antics alongside the likes of Britney Spears and Lindsay Lohan Paris is still a party girl at heart. The only difference is she gets paid a lot more these days. Since debuting as a DJ almost a decade ago she has been paid up to US$1 million for a single DJ set and in 2014 she earned an impressive US$2.7 million for four nights’ work during her residency in Ibiza.

Paris turned “famous for nothing” into an art and she’s still laughing all the way to the bank.

Kyle Richards 52

Estimated net worth: US$100 million

She may not be a fully fledged Hilton but as Kathy’s half sister with an impressive net worth of around USD$100 million (combined with her husband) Kyle certainly deserves her spot on this list.

Ever since she joined The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills in 2010 Kyle’s net worth has increased significantly. It’s no wonder she’s the last original cast member on the show still raking in the big bucks.

Of course Richards’ husband Mauricio Umansky is a successful property agent which doesn’t hurt. Mauricio has been involved with high profile properties including the Playboy Mansion and Walt Disney estate through his own real estate firm The Agency. He previously sold extravagant properties to mega celebrities like Michael Jackson and Prince back in the day.

Nicky Hilton Rothschild 37

Estimated net worth: US$50 million

Paris’ sister Nicky is a successful fashion designer model author and mum of two and she’s worked just as hard as her big sis. She’s done everything from fashion and cosmetics lines to jewellery and bags earning her an impressive US$50 million on her own.

But there’s a twist: Nicky is probably the wealthiest Hilton richer than all of them combined. Or at least she eventually will be as the wife of James Rothschild from the uber-rich Rothschild dynasty – a London banking family. The Rothschild family had the largest private fortune in the world in the 19th century as well as throughout history at the time.

As of 2021 the net worth of James Rothschild is estimated at around US$1.5 billion. So let’s be honest – Nicky really doesn’t need to hustle any more. At all. Ever.

Barron Hilton II 31

Estimated net worth: US$5 million

Barron Hilton II. Photo: @barronhilton/Instagram

Living in the shadow of your ultra-famous sisters can’t be easy for a young guy growing up but it seems Barron Nicholas Hilton II is perfectly happy keeping things low key.

Of course being a handsome young Hilton he models. He is often seen doing print ads and walking the runway. In 2015 he made a short horror film called En Passant and he also started a foodie account on Instagram called Barron’s Bites.

Barron who is now worth around US$5 million married German countess Tessa Gräfin von Walderdorff in 2018 and they welcomed their daughter Milou Alizée in March 2020.

Kim Richards 56

Estimated net worth: USD$500000

Kathy and Kyle may be rolling in cash but their other sister Kim is only worth US$500000 according to Celebrity Net Worth.

Kim was a successful actress throughout the 70s and 80s and appeared on the first five seasons of RHOBH but in recent years it’s her troubled personal life that has made headlines (and drained her bank account).

In 2015 Richards was famously arrested and charged with trespassing public intoxication resisting an officer and battery on a police officer at the iconic Beverly Hills Hotel. A few months later she was caught allegedly shoplifting at a Target department store and paid a second visit to jail for the year.

Conrad Hilton III 27

Estimated net worth: unknown

Not much is known about the youngest Hilton sibling except for some troublesome headlines over the years and he is widely believed to be unemployed.

Last year Conrad was sentenced to prison for using drugs violating his parole stemming from a 2015 arrest for causing a disturbance on a flight from London to Los Angeles (he proceeded to threaten cabin crew and called fellow passengers “peasants” – ouch).

Let’s hope he can get back on track so he can start raking in big bucks like the rest of his family. Or just stay healthy and out of trouble at least.

Just as libertarians and progressives promote their substantive values in interpretation the argument goes so conservatives should embrace an interpretive method that allows judges to be statesmen working for the good and the true rather than mere mouthpieces of whatever the written law happens to say. They can do this Hammer believes without abandoning originalism altogether in the way that Adrian Vermeule’s common-good constitutionalism proposed. To walk this delicate line Hammer relies on a broad understanding of the original intent of the founders that leaves room for judges to use their own moral judgment in pursuit of the Constitution’s ultimate goals.

Hammer’s most recent effort is his most detailed presentation to date and it includes his case for reading the Constitution in such a way. In his view the history and Preamble of the Constitution amount to a kind of constitutional biography showing us its ultimate purpose—its ratio legis drawing on Blackstone—which ought to inform a judge’s understanding of any given part of the document.

But as Chief Justice William Rehnquist observed when debunking the oft-used “wall of separation” metaphor “It is impossible to build sound constitutional doctrine upon a mistaken understanding of constitutional history.” While common-good originalism has been ably critiqued on several fronts its historical understanding of the Constitution’s adoption is perhaps its weakest link. The Constitution’s actual biography reveals a document that emerged from a negotiated consensus of a complex popular sovereign—a fact that makes Hammer’s Blackstonian interpretive arguments inapplicable and that ought to reinforce a judge’s commitment to the written text not a teleocratic spirit.

The Idea of a Ratio Legis

According to common-good originalism judges must interpret the Constitution through the “prism” of its “substantive political aims”—the supposed purpose of the regime articulated in the Preamble and discernible in its pre-constitutional history. If we look to the Preamble Hammer says we see talk of a national pursuit of the common good; if we look to the cause of the convention we see the need for a more powerful central government. Therefore a judge interpreting the Constitution through this telos will “look to the overall health of the whole body politic and the whole nation-state.”

This vision he stresses is the central element of America’s British inheritance coming from Blackstone’s discussion of the ratio legis. According to Blackstone “the most universal and effectual way of discovering the true meaning of a law when the words are dubious is by considering the reason and spirit of it; or the cause which moved the legislator to enact it.”

The appeal to a ratio legis is the key that puts the “originalism” in common-good originalism and distinguishes it from Vermeule. Despite its relentless complaints about the positivist foundations of traditional originalism common-good originalism still ultimately finds its legitimacy in a search for the “will of the legislator” to use Blackstone’s description.

Blackstone goes on to say that the idea of a ratio legis is the origin of equity power by which courts could grant certain remedies in circumstances to which the legislature had not directly spoken:

. . . for since in laws all cases cannot be foreseen or expressed it is necessary that when the general decrees of the law come to be applied to particular cases there should be somewhere a power vested of excepting those circumstances which (had they been foreseen) the legislator himself would have expected.

There are essential differences between what Blackstone describes and what Hammer describes.

First Blackstone argues that this authority is only applicable “when the words are dubious.” Hammer presents it as an essential element to understanding the entire Constitution: “it is impossible to properly understand what a specific legal provision meant . . . without understanding . . . the broader societal role and function for which the law was devised.” Blackstone though is quite explicit that this type of power cannot be used pervasively: “the liberty of considering all cases in an equitable light must not be indulged too far” he cautions “lest thereby we destroy all law and leave the decision of every question entirely in the breast of the judge.”

Second Blackstone writes of a judge applying a law passed by a legislature. By importing the concept to constitutional law Hammer applies it to decisions about the authority of the legislature derived from a written constitution. Third as his example makes clear Blackstone had in mind an immediate specific cause of a particular law. Hammer has in mind a broad polity-defining purpose—the “telos of the American Regime” to which any statute or judicial decree is “necessarily subservient.” Finally read in context it is reasonable to presume that Blackstone believed the principle would be useful and appropriate only if the ratio legis was clear and unambiguous for he brings it up only as a tool for resolving ambiguity. Hammer believes this to be the case with the Constitution arguing that it can be understood as the product of a small likeminded cadre of founders with a clearly discernible and coherent purpose. Constitutional history however belies this understanding.

Let us then turn to the American Constitution and its context.

“No Man’s Ideas Were More Remote”

How might one arrive at the claim that discretionary common-good-oriented statesmanship is the defining characteristic of the American Constitution? This is the second vital key to the common-good originalism project because it is the link by which a certain ideal of statesmanship can be applied to judges. It’s not just that the Constitution allows room for a degree of national-minded statesmanship within its limiting divided structure; rather Hammer argues that the Constitution is defined by such an ideal which therefore rightly infuses a judge’s interpretation of the original Constitution its amendments and even statutes.

To prove this Hammer looks to the constitutional convention (or more precisely to a certain group of delegates at the convention) for the intent of the lawgiver. He hangs his thesis on the idea that “nationalist common good-oriented Anglo-inspired conservatives” were responsible for calling the convention “came to dominate” its proceedings and wrote their goals into the Preamble thereby infusing their purposes into the document. Surprisingly he places the most emphasis on one of the least influential delegates in Philadelphia: Alexander Hamilton. No one’s name comes up more often in the various essays promoting common-good originalism than Hamilton’s whose “conception of an Anglo-inspired prudential non-rationalist common good-oriented originalist jurisprudence” is the model for the theory. In this most recent paper Hammer makes the rather dubious declaration that Hamilton exerted “intellectual dominance” over the founding era.

Did the convention and Preamble actually infuse a Hamiltonian spirit into the Constitution as Hammer claims? As I’ve noted elsewhere there is little evidence that either the framers or the ratifiers held the Preamble to infuse any power-expanding telos into the Constitution. When Federalists pointed to the Preamble it was generally not to the various purposes listed but to the first line—“We the People”—drawing attention to the fact that this fundamental law was the act of a popular sovereign. In fact Hammer’s depiction of the Preamble is more in line with the fears of Anti-Federalists such as the fifth letter of “Brutus”—fears that Federalists repeatedly insisted were unfounded.

But even assuming the Preamble to be the fundamental interpretive key does not get us very far. The purposes it identifies are not all ends of the new government but of the Constitution broadly (“. . . do ordain and establish this constitution” not “this government”). They are all broad vague goods that any political system—centralized or decentralized—would aim for and that no faction at the convention or the population at large would have objected to.

This gets to one of the core flaws of Hammer’s approach. By focusing too much on today’s rhetorical dichotomy between “the common good” and “individual liberty”—a distinction he acknowledges was not as stark to the founding generation—he elides the fundamental questions of the convention and ratification. How are these goods best promoted? What structure of delegated power enumerated rights and divided government would best protect liberty and promote the general welfare?

The fact that the convention was called in response to an excessively weak central government and that it moved in the direction of greater national power cannot possibly justify a presumption in favor of power for it was precisely that open question—how much national power and in what form—that defined the constitutional debate. It was widespread disagreement on this question that made a compromise constitution necessary. The Preamble does not offer any substantive answers on these questions. It merely introduces the content of the compromise.

Moving on to the convention itself it should first be recognized that it drafted the Constitution but did not make the law. It therefore cannot stand in the place of Blackstone’s parliamentary “legislator.” The people of the states through conventions made the Constitution the law which complicates the ratio legis analysis considerably. But putting this aside for the moment did the nationalists “dominate” the debate as is claimed? If so one would assume they achieved most of their goals and that they were happy with the outcome. But the unfulfilled wish list of the convention’s various hyper-nationalists is as long as your arm: proportional representation in both houses of Congress; a directly elected president; an unlimited veto in the hands of that president; Hamilton’s president-for-life; the authority of Congress “to legislate in all cases to which the separate States are incompetent: or in which the harmony of the United States may be interrupted by the exercise of individual legislation”; a national negative on state laws.

These last two in particular would seem to encapsulate perfectly the idea of common-good conservatism and its associated jurisprudence: far-sighted national-minded statesmen authorized to use their wisdom and prudence to legislate for the public good in the way that seems best to them and to strike down problematic parochial legislation. Both were quickly and easily rejected by the convention.

It is well-documented that the nationalists—especially Hamilton whose influence at the convention was very slight—were disappointed with the final product.

As a result of such defeats it is well-documented that the nationalists—especially Hamilton whose influence at the convention was very slight—were disappointed with the final product. Madison records Hamilton as declaring on the final day of the convention that “No man’s ideas were more remote from the plan [adopted] than his own were known to be.”

Any honest account of the convention would show that moderates like Roger Sherman John Dickinson and Oliver Ellsworth and even constitutional skeptics like Elbridge Gerry and Luther Martin had as much or more of a say in the final outcome than the Hamiltons Wilsons and Morrises. And the decision of figures like George Mason and Edmund Randolph not to sign the final document shows that the desire for a relatively strong popularly based national government did not necessarily demonstrate a comfort with the kind of sweeping discretionary power common-good originalism champions.

Far from being “relatively unified” the convention’s delegates overcame the fact that as Franklin observed when urging prayer over lack of progress they had “different sentiments on almost every question.” The convention’s letter to Congress (drafted by arch-nationalist Gouverneur Morris) captures this reality: “It is at all times difficult to draw with precision the line between those rights which must be surrendered and those which may be reserved” especially given “a difference among the several States as to their situation extent habits and particular interests.” As a result the convention produced a document born out of “a spirit of amity and of that mutual deference and concession which the peculiarity of our political situation rendered indispensable.” The compromise was a feature not a bug.

If there is little evidence to be found from the convention of a constitutional spirit in favor of discretionary pursuit of the common good there is even less when examining the ratification. The nationalists’ rapid rhetorical shift when moving into the ratification phase further makes it clear that a nationalist spirit was neither embodied in the Constitution nor likely to be attractive to the citizenry at large. Even when defending his relatively broad reading of the necessary and proper clause—the Constitution’s most flexible delegation of power—Hamilton stressed that “if there is anything exceptionable it must be sought for in the specific powers” not in an undefined appeal to the common good. Likewise in his State House Speech—one of the most widely reprinted and influential Federalist writings—Wilson unambiguously stated that “congressional authority is to be collected not from tacit implication but from the positive grant expressed in the instrument of union.” Is this “rote proceduralist positivism”?

The thirteen separate state ratifying conventions each of which had a unique intellectual and political context reveal a great variety of reasons for adopting the Constitution. Some ratified quickly and eagerly with overwhelming votes of Federalists. Others depended heavily on moderate Anti-Federalists like Melancton Smith of New York who were either reassured of the national government’s limits or were promised amendments. Some states ratified without comment others included proposed amendments most of which stated more emphatically the limits of national power or suggested firmer safeguards against the use of discretionary power. And of course some states were motivated to ratify mostly because all the others had. There is no unifying teleocratic spirit to be found here.

Tacit Implications

Are the “tacit implications” of Blackstone’s ratio legis applicable to American constitutional interpretation? The precise nature of American sovereignty has of course been hotly debated for much of the republic’s history. But no conception of the American sovereign can avoid the historical realities of ratification. Unlike Blackstone’s parliamentary sovereign from which one might discern a distinct purpose (though that is extremely difficult too) the American sovereign established its fundamental law through a complex and popular mechanism in thirteen separate conventions which reflected the differences that had run through the entire process. This essential difference forecloses the possibility of any clear and unambiguous purpose shared by those adopting a frame of government.

In fact the history and context of the Constitution affirmatively point in the opposite direction. When thirteen bodies with varying motivations and varying degrees of skepticism approve of a heavily compromised document we have few guides aside from the one thing we know they agreed upon: the text they all ratified. And that’s how the nationalists convinced the skeptical moderates and Anti-Federalists to get on board—by reassuring them over and over that there were no “tacit implications” and hidden meanings; that “everything not granted is reserved”; that the Constitution’s meaning was contained in its words.

And that’s what Blackstone recommended anyway offering extratextual interpretive guides only “if words happen to be dubious.” Of course words can be dubious and the judge may have to look to context history or common law when it is necessary to understand what certain words and phrases meant—the author of District of Columbia v. Heller did not lack in concern for intellectual context. But if we find meaning apart from the words drawing on the ideals of particular individuals we go beyond the consensus that made the Constitution the law in the first place. This does not represent the “will of the legislator” and can therefore be no form of originalism.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vcmVmcmVzaG1pYW1pLmNvbS90aGUtbWlhbWktbW92ZW1lbnQtaXMtcmVhbC1qdXN0LWxvb2stYXQtdGhlLW5ld3Mtb2YtdGhlLXBhc3Qtc2l4LW1vbnRocy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Miami Movement is real – just look at the news of the past six months,"I am writing a mid-year 2021 look-back column for a report I’m authoring and because the pace of news has been a blur I have been iPhone scrolling the Refresh Miami headlines from present back to Jan. 1.

The Miami Movement IS real and our metro area is on the way to becoming one of the country’s top tech hubs. There are too many fund-raisings (106 in 1H) to list – but here were a few and they are a mix of the new Miami and the OGs: Pipe (the first half’s top deal at $250M) Lula Memic Papa NUE Health Lumu QuickNode SmartHop ShipMonk Ironhack Introhive Heru Asteya OpenStore and more. Suffice it to say more than $900 million was invested in Q2 and the new Miami Movement accelerated by Miami Mayor Francis Suarez’s efforts played a big part in that.

Our new-to-Miami investors are showing up in investment rounds – Founders Fund and Khosla Ventures led Lula’s recent $18 million Series A for example.

But as you are scrolling backward on Refresh Miami from now back to Jan. 1 you’ll notice that even beyond the fund-raisings relocation announcements spotlights and investor Q&As there were also headlines marking interesting developments to watch as well as some significant milestones for our South Florida ecosystem including some exits. They may get lost among the funding news so here are some of those Refresh headlines in 2021 starting with the most recent:

The Boeing 737 MAX 8 — the smaller of the two MAX variants currently in service — joined the carrier's domestic fleet on July 16 marking the first of 270 new domestic jets that are slated to be delivered to United over the coming years.

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

This isn't just any domestic jet though.

It's the first to feature United's newly unveiled ""signature interior"" with seat-back screens larger overhead bins power outlets and other passenger-friendly amenities from nose to tail. All new United planes will be delivered from the factory with the upgraded cabins while existing ones will undergo a comprehensive retrofit program.

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

For now if you're looking for the swankiest domestic experience offered by United you'll want to book on the MAX 8. And once you're booked on Boeing's new (and beleaguered) workhorse here's which seats to pick and which ones to avoid.

If faced with the choice you'll definitely want to snag one of the 16 first-class recliners on the United 737 MAX 8.

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

Seats are spread across four rows in a 2-2 configuration with roughly 37 inches of pitch.

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

Though the ""bones"" of the seat are identical to the new ones you'll find on other domestic UA jets the seats feel more modern thanks to the 13-inch high-definition seat-back monitor and other refined touches like a remote control and relocated power outlet.

Some travelers like sitting in the bulkhead but I'd recommend avoiding row 1 on the United 737 MAX 8. That's because the screens are fixed into the bulkhead wall — if you're really tall or height-challenged you'll need to bend your neck to watch your content.

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

Another drawback to the bulkhead is that there's a built-in airbag in each of the seat belts. Though this feature is designed for your safety the airbag can get uncomfortable after resting on your hips throughout the flight.

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

I'd recommend choosing seats in row 2 or 3 when flying upfront on the 737 MAX 8.

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

Row 4 would be my second-to-last pick. You'll be reclining into the bulkhead wall dividing first class and coach and the proximity to the coach cabin could be bothersome.

United Economy Plus on the Boeing 737 MAX 8

The first thing I noticed when boarding United's new MAX is the sheer number of extra-legroom Economy Plus seats.

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

These ""purple seats"" as they're affectionately called by some flight attendants span nine rows in a standard 3-3 configuration.

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

As part of United's five-year plan dubbed ""United Next"" the carrier's investing in growing the proportion of premium seats in its fleet including both first-class and Economy Plus by roughly 75% from 2019 to 2026.

These seats offer an additional three to four inches of pitch compared to regular economy but the actual seats themselves are otherwise identical.

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

Some of the 54 Economy Plus seats are much better than others so let's start with which ones you might want to avoid:

Row seven is the bulkhead. Some people will undoubtedly enjoy these seats — no one reclines into you and the bulkhead wall doesn't extend all the way to the floor so there's ample under-seat storage below the two first-class recliners in front. However two of the biggest drawbacks include immovable armrests and the fact that the seat-back screens swivel out from in between each seat.

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

Row 11 is missing windows. If you're an aviation enthusiast who enjoys staring out the window you'll be disappointed if you end up in Row 11.

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

Row 12 and Row 14 each have just one window compared to the two you'll find in other rows. This isn't a dealbreaker for me but if you're after the perfect wing-view shot you may prefer to sit elsewhere.

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

Row 15 is right in front of the exit row. As such these seats don't recline so I'd recommend steering clear of these six spots.

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

As for where you should sit anywhere else in the Economy Plus section works but I have a strong preference for exit row 21. Here you'll find a total of 38 inches of pitch — eight more than in standard coach — and the seats recline as normal.

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

The only downside is that the window armrest is built into the exit door so it's not nearly as comfortable as those you'll find elsewhere on the jet.

United Economy on the Boeing 737 MAX 8

With 96 seats most flyers will end up sitting in the standard economy section. Good thing these are some of the best coach seats in the United fleet.

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

After all you'll find a seat-back monitor large overhead bins power outlets and USB ports available throughout the cabin including in economy.

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

Pitch is roughly 30 inches so it could definitely feel tight depending on your body size.

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

The only seats to avoid in coach are those in the last row 38 due to limited recline. Otherwise the remaining rows are roughly equal.

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

I'd try sitting as close to the front as possible for a faster deplaning experience but otherwise you can't really go wrong with other coach seats.

Bottom line

United's newest jet the Boeing 737 MAX 8 is now flying the friendly skies. With an upgraded onboard experience this is the plane that'll likely win United some awards. While the enhancements span nose to tail all seats aren't created equally.

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

It pays to know where to sit so that you avoid missing window views and instead maximize your legroom.

In first-class you'll find me in row two or three. In Economy Plus I'll be in exit row 21 and in coach I'll choose a seat as close to the front as possible.

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

If you notice that one of my preferred seats is already assigned when booking perhaps we'll be on the same flight.

Developer Prism Capital Partners said it has secured final site-plan approval from the city of Clifton New Jersey for a dual-branded Marriott AC/Element Hotel at ON3. The 266-room hospitality property will offer a rooftop bar and feature both limited-service and extended-stay options for patrons according to Prism which is headquartered on the ON3 campus. The seven-story structure will occupy a parcel that’s visible from state Route 3 along Metro Boulevard according to Prism.

The developer has transformed pharmaceutical giant Hoffmann-La Roche’s 116-acre former site which straddles Clifton and Nutley into a mixed-use site with an array of tenants. ON3 houses roughly 1.45 million square feet of existing office and lab research-and-development space that’s fully occupied or soon to be occupied by Japanese drugmaker Eisai Quest Diagnostics Ralph Lauren Modern Meadow Y-mAbs Therapeutics and Seton Hall University’s Graduate College of Nursing and School of Health and Medical Sciences.

Dual-branded hotels where two distinct hotel concepts are paired under one roof have been a trend in the hospitality industry but are fairly unusual in Northern New Jersey. They provide guests with a choice of different accommodations and price ranges for rooms at one location and allow hoteliers to save money by consolidating amenity space and “back-of-the-house” operations such as housekeeping and food and beverage service.

A dual-branded hotel a Hampton Inn & Suites and Homewood Suites two Hilton properties opened at the Glenpointe office complex in Teaneck New Jersey in 2018.

“The city of Clifton understands the immense benefits of a world-class mixed-use property; it has been a great partner in embracing our vision for ON3 and supporting the development needed to realize its full potential” Prism Principal Partner Eugene Diaz said in a statement. “The hotel and rooftop bar are long-missing amenities for this area and by securing the Marriott flag we continue to establish ON3 as a magnet for industry-leading brands.”

Late last year Clifton also approved a build-to-suit medical office building at the southeast corner of Metro Boulevard and Route 3 at ON3. The 80000-square-foot facility has been preleased to Hackensack Meridian Health which already occupies academic and R&D space at the campus including its School of Medicine and Center for Discovery and Innovation. The medical office building will include an ambulatory surgical center as well as additional multispecialty practice areas.

Prism said it expects that more than 5500 people will be employed at ON3 by the end of this year while the ongoing redevelopment also is creating hundreds of construction jobs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2pvZXdhbHNoLzIwMjEvMDcvMjQvdmF0aWNhbi1vd25zLW92ZXItNTAwMC1wcm9wZXJ0aWVzLXdvcmxkd2lkZS1pdC1yZXZlYWxzLWluLWZpcnN0LWRpc2Nsb3N1cmVzLW9uLWl0cy1yZWFsLWVzdGF0ZS1ob2xkaW5ncy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Vatican Owns Over 5000 Properties Worldwide It Reveals In First Disclosures On Its Real Estate Holdings,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/joewalsh/2021/07/24/vatican-owns-over-5000-properties-worldwide-it-reveals-in-first-disclosures-on-its-real-estate-holdings/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2pvZXdhbHNoLzIwMjEvMDcvMjQvdmF0aWNhbi1vd25zLW92ZXItNTAwMC1wcm9wZXJ0aWVzLXdvcmxkd2lkZS1pdC1yZXZlYWxzLWluLWZpcnN0LWRpc2Nsb3N1cmVzLW9uLWl0cy1yZWFsLWVzdGF0ZS1ob2xkaW5ncy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael Regan officially announced earlier this month that the Biden administration will reinterpret the Trump administration’s definition of what constitutes “waters of the United States”—waterways that are deserving of federal protection.

The Trump definition was actually a reinterpretation (or rejection) of what the Obama administration delineated as waters worthy of federal oversight. Obama had sought to increase protections under the Clean Water Act based on EPA science conducted under both his administration and that of his predecessor George W. Bush. The agency’s researchers had determined that many wetlands and rain-fed intermittent and ephemeral streams were significantly connected to larger bodies of water than met the eye—and thus those tributaries warranted protection.

The Trump administration’s own scientific advisors agreed with Obama’s interpretation. No matter the Trump EPA gutted the rule on behalf of industrial and agricultural polluters by removing half of wetlands and a fifth of streams and tributaries from protection. That shift amounted to an overall 25-percent drop in protected waters according to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

Noting that the Trump rule “is leading to significant environmental degradation” Regan said he would work toward a “durable definition” of waters of the United States. And he begins that effort at a time of year when precisely because of decades of federally enforced cleanups New England’s most famous river—and once one of its most infamous—the Charles is as magical as Florida’s Everglades.

The most stunning drama this spring along the banks of the Charles walking distance from downtown Boston has been a pair of mute swans. They nested at a landing alongside a walking and biking path in the Back Bay neighborhood and produced nine eggs. Seven hatched. By predation or sickliness the number of cygnets eventually went down to five.

Then without warning the mother died on the nest. A necropsy showed neither foul play nor ingested foreign objects did her in. The father then took on the chicks sometimes letting them ride on his back. Even though the number of chicks has dwindled down to two as of late June the family continues to stop strollers and joggers in their tracks as do more familiar families of geese and goslings and ducks and ducklings cruising the waters and grazing on the grass.

A couple miles up the river from downtown black-crowned night herons and great blue herons patrol the banks snapping up river herring that have been restored through federal and state efforts. During the herring run gulls often wait at a dam in the suburb of Watertown to gobble up the fish that evaded the herons’ beaks.

Osprey occasionally fly in to dive for fish. Muskrat cruise the reeds as turtles bask on floating logs. As the river heads deeper into exurban Boston bald eagles have been nesting continuing their remarkable recovery from a point in the 20th century when pesticides had led to their disappearance in most states.

All this fauna can now be seen in a river once so polluted that the locals joked about people needing tetanus shots if they fell in. The foul Charles even inspired the Boston anthem “Dirty Water” by the Standells. As recently as 1995 the river earned a D for water quality at its mouth in Boston Harbor a result of uncontrolled human sewage railyard oil pollution industrial waste and landfills that crept up right to the water’s edge.

The river’s revival began in the 1980s when conservationists and the EPA joined forces to sue the state of Massachusetts over the levels of wastewater pollution in the Charles. That resulted in federal judicial oversight of more than $4.5 billion of mitigation projects managed by the state most notably a massive waste-treatment facility and the overhaul of 100 miles of leaky sewage pipes and storm drains. Local conservation groups also convinced the Army Corps of Engineers to protect 8000 acres of wetlands in the Upper Charles watershed.

Today the water is technically swimmable most of the time — though one dares not touch the riverbed with bare feet as it is still laden with heavy metals. Recognized a decade ago as one of the world’s most well-managed rivers the Charles is now a year-round wonder of wildlife. Last winter its waters as well as the Boston Harbor’s were full of mergansers scoters goldeneye eiders bufflehead and loons.

It is the protection of the Charles’ watershed that freshwater scientists want EPA Administrator Regan to keep in mind as he sets forth to protect more American waterways. Despite accounting for fewer than six percent of the United States landscape they consider wetlands to be precious jewels of the ecosystem. These marshes and swamps where plants grow thick in soil saturated with water are natural traps and filters for runoff and sediment. They also provide nurseries for aquatic life.

It is also the part of the ecosystem that industry and factory agriculture often intrude upon and plow over with the consent of government officials. Consider the ill-fated Foxconn electronics plant in southern Wisconsin. After promising 13000 jobs in 2017 the state gave the company billions of dollars in tax breaks as well as waivers to fill in 38 acres of wetlands to build their facility. The company now is only pledging 1500 jobs while flooding and erosion risks have risen in the region because of the wetland loss.

In advance of this month’s announcement Regan told a House committee in April that while Trump went too far in his reinterpretation of the waters of the U.S. the administrator was not going back “verbatim” to the Obama-era rules. The statement seemed designed to placate the farm lobby which has claimed that the Biden EPA would patrol every ditch to see if each is connected to rivers.

While it is politically understandable that Regan must get as he said “input from a wide array of stakeholders” federal science nevertheless does not quibble about the interconnectivity of our waters.

As he gathers input perhaps a trip to Boston to gather input from the swans herons and herring is in order. They are illustrating the importance of healthy watersheds and well-managed waterways via their nesting near the Charles in their gathering along banks to feed and by making their spring runs up the river.

The decision followed the regulatory agency's evaluation of accelerated approvals for checkpoint inhibitors that have not met their post-marketing requirements with regard to showcasing confirmatory benefit.2

In September 2017 the FDA granted an accelerated approval to the PD-1 inhibitor for the treatment of patients with HCC after previous sorafenib irrespective of PD-L1 status based on findings from the phase 1/2 CheckMate-040 trial (NCT01658878).3 Earlier data on the 154 patients enrolled to the trial showed that the immunotherapy elicited an overall response rate (ORR) of 18.2% per blinded independent central review and modified RECIST criteria; 3.2% achieved a complete response. The ORR per RECIST v1.1 was 14.3% with nivolumab. The duration of response achieved with the agent ranged from 3.2 months to 38.2+ months.

The confirmatory phase 3 CheckMate-459 trial (NCT02576509) that compared nivolumab with sorafenib in the frontline setting did not achieve statistical significance for its primary end point of overall survival per the prespecified analysis.4

“We are disappointed by the position the Advisory Committee and the FDA have taken regarding the continued approval of nivolumab monotherapy as a treatment for [patients with] HCC post-sorafenib. HCC is a complex and challenging disease and for patients who are initially treated with sorafenib and either cannot tolerate treatment or whose disease progresses immunotherapy is an important treatment option. For the past three and a half years [nivolumab] monotherapy has been an important option that physicians have relied on to address this need and is currently the most commonly used therapy in the post-sorafenib setting” Jonathan Cheng senior vice president and head of oncology development at Bristol Myers Squibb stated in a press release. “[Nivolumab] helped usher in an entirely new way to treat patients with this disease. We continue to support the FDA’s accelerated approval program which has been integral to enabling people with difficult to treat cancers to gain access to certain safe and effective new therapies sooner.”

The multicenter phase 3 CheckMate-459 trial examined nivolumab vs sorafenib as a first-line treatment in 1009 patients with unresectable HCC. Treatment was administered until progressive disease or intolerable toxicity.

To be eligible for enrollment patients had to be at least 18 years of age; have histologically confirmed advanced HCC that was ineligible for surgical and/or locoregional therapies or progressive disease following either of those treatments; have locoregional therapy for HCC that must have been at least 4 weeks prior to baseline scan; have Child-Pugh Class A disease; and an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. Patients with known fibrolamellar HCC sarcomatoid HCC or mixed cholangiocarcinoma and HCC as well as those who had a prior liver transplant or autoimmune disease were excluded from the trial.

The primary end point of the trial was OS and key secondary end points were ORR progression-free survival and evaluating the relationship between PD-L1 expression and efficacy.

Nivolumab is being evaluated in a number of other ongoing trials: as a single agent in the adjuvant setting in CheckMate-9DX (NCT03383458) and also in combination with ipilimumab (Yervoy) for previously treated patients with HCC (NCT01658878).

“With additional follow-up lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab continues to show clinically meaningful durable responses in patients with advanced melanoma with confirmed disease progression on a PD-1 or PD-1 plus CTLA-4 (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4) inhibitor an expanding population with very limited options” said Ana Arance MD PhD of Hospital Clinic de Barcelona. “The data continue to support lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab as a potential treatment regimen for this population of high unmet medical need.”

About LEAP-004

LEAP-004 enrolled 103 patients with unresectable stage III or IV melanoma who developed progressive disease while on treatment or within 12 weeks of their last dose of a PD-1 inhibitor given alone or with an anti–CTLA-4 or other therapy. Patients received 20 mg of lenvatinib daily plus pembrolizumab at 200 mg every 3 weeks for a maximum of 35 doses. The primary endpoint of the study was objective response assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 on blinded independent review.

At a median study follow-up of 15.3 months when 18 patients were still on study treatment the objective response rate remained essentially the same (21.4%) as reported in a previous analysis.2 One additional patient achieved a complete response and one more was confirmed for stable disease (66%; Table 1).

“Median duration of response compared with the previous analysis increased from 6.3 months to 8.3 months. With that 38.6% of the responses are ongoing at 9 months” Dr. Arance reported. Median progression-free survival and overall survival remained unchanged at 4.2 months and 14.0 months respectively. At 12 months 18.5% of patients were progression-free and 54.5% were alive.

Primary and Secondary Resistance

Responses were analyzed according to primary and secondary resistance. Among 103 enrolled patients 62 (60.2%) had primary resistance in the metastatic setting (nonresponse or disease progression on prior anti–PD-1 therapy). Responses were comparable among patients with primary (22.6%) and secondary (22.7%) resistance to prior anti–PD-1–based therapy according to Dr Arance. Response to lenvatinib/pembrolizumab was 18.2% in patients who experienced primary resistance in the adjuvant setting (n = 11).

Treatment-related adverse events were comparable to previous analyses and consistent with the known safety profile of the combination of lenvatinib and pembrolizumab. Grade 3 to 5 adverse events were observed in 46% of patients. Lenvatinib dose interruptions or reductions were required in almost 60% although less than 8% discontinued treatment.

The combination led to a response rate of 64% a median duration of response of 11.8 months and a median progression-free survival of 10.6 months in patients with high FRα expression in the phase Ib FORWARD II trial said David M. O’Malley MD Professor Director of Gynecologic Oncology and Co-Director of the Gynecologic Oncology Phase I Program of The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center and James Cancer Hospital Columbus.





“The progression-free survival…demonstrated that patients with high FRα benefit the most from the combination of mirvetuximab [soravtansine] and bevacizumab.” — David M. O’Malley MD

“These data add to the previously reported findings2 and support the use of mirvetuximab as the partner of choice for bevacizumab in patients with high FRα [expression] ovarian cancer following the use of platinum-based treatments” Dr. O’Malley said. “Further development of mirvetuximab in combination with bevacizumab is warranted.”

About Mirvetuximab Soravtansine

Mirvetuximab soravtansine is a first-in-class antibody-drug conjugate comprising an FRα-binding antibody cleavable linker and the maytansinoid DM4 (a potent tubulin-targeting agent). The combination of mirvetuximab soravtansine and bevacizumab was evaluated in patients with FRα-positive (medium/high expression; ≥ 50%/≥ 75% of cells with PS2+ staining intensity) platinum-agnostic ovarian cancer for whom a nonplatinum doublet would be appropriate. Patients with platinum-agnostic ovarian cancer were defined as having either platinum-resistant disease (recurrence within 6 months of last platinum dose) or platinum-sensitive disease (response to platinum and no disease progression within 6 months).

Mirvetuximab soravtansine at 6 mg/kg plus bevacizumab at 15 mg/kg was given on day 1 of a 21-day cycle to 60 patients who had received a median of two prior lines of therapy and were followed for a median of 17.5 months. Many patients (68%) had epithelial ovarian cancer whereas the rest had fallopian tube cancer (25%) and primary peritoneal cancer (7%). All patients had prior exposure to platinum-based compounds and taxanes 40% had previously received bevacizumab and 35% had exposure to poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors.

By platinum sensitivity there were 32 patients (53%) with platinum-resistant disease and 28 (47%) with platinum-sensitive disease. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed response.

Response Rates Improved

In the overall patient population high response rates and durability were observed especially among patients with high FRα expression (Table 1). “These deep responses are rapid and durable…in patients with platinum-resistant and platinum-sensitive disease. Many of these durable responses continued beyond 6 to 12 months with some patients’ responses lasting more than 2 years” Dr. O’Malley said.

“Much like the data for the objective response rate and duration of response the progression-free survival demonstrated that patients with high FRα [expression] benefit the most from the combination of mirvetuximab and bevacizumab” he said.

KEY POINTS The phase Ib FORWARD II trial evaluated the antibody-drug conjugate mirvetuximab soravtansine plus bevacizumab in patients with ovarian cancer who had disease progression after treatment with a platinum agent.

Activity was strong in patients with high expression of folate receptor alpha (FRα) with a response rate of 64% a median duration of response of 11.8 months and a median progression-free survival of 10.6 months.

In patients with high FRα expression and platinum-sensitive recurrence the response rate was 69% the median duration of response was 12.7 months and the median progression-free survival was 13.3 months.

Median progression-free survival was 10.6 months in the subgroup with high FRα expression and 5.4 months in the subgroup with medium FRα expression. For high expressors 80% had not experienced disease progression at 6 months and 42% had no disease progression at 12 months.

Safety Profile

The adverse events observed with the doublet were manageable and consistent with the side-effect profiles of each agent according to Dr. O’Malley. Treatment-related toxicities were generally low grade with diarrhea (62%) blurred vision (60%) fatigue (60%) and nausea (57%) being the most common. The most common grade ≥ 3 events were hypertension (17%) and neutropenia (13%). In total 30% of patients discontinued treatment with mirvetuximab soravtansine and bevacizumab due to treatment-related adverse events; the median time to treatment discontinuation was 13 cycles.

“The strength of these mature data warrant further development of this novel targeted combination and I look forward to evaluating this regimen in earlier lines of therapy” Dr. O’Malley concluded.

Shares of Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) recently hit an all-time high and are up nearly threefold since 2016 when the firm formerly known as Avago Technologies Inc. paid $37 billion to buy the Irvine chipmaker founded by Samueli and Henry Nicholas thirty years ago. The San Jose firm kept the Broadcom name post-sale.



The two Henry’s were already billionaires before the Avago deal; they’ve added billions more to their wealth over the past five years according to Business Journal research. Broadcom shares are up about 50% in the past year alone.



Samueli whose 2.3% stake in Broadcom makes him the tech giant’s largest individual shareholder is estimated to be worth about $7 billion while Nicholas who is no longer involved in the company but is believed to still count a large stake in the company is estimated at $5.4 billion.

Anaheim Work



Samueli’s local business dealings go well beyond Broadcom as he and his family have spent the past several years moving ahead with major philanthropy initiatives in the area and with real estate expansion in Anaheim.



He and his wife Susan own the Anaheim Ducks Hockey Club LLC and the company that runs the Honda Center. They’re developing a major real estate project around the hockey arena in that city.



The Samuelis have spent the last several years snapping up land around the Honda Center that will serve as the development site for the proposed project OCVibe branded as ocV!BE.



The $3 billion project will include 2800 residential units two hotels more than 800000 square feet of office space a new concert venue food hall restaurants parks and other amenities in the area surrounding the 650000-square-foot Honda Center which the Samuelis have managed since 2003.



Work carries on for the development. A new general manager for the mega-project Kim Bedier was named last week.



Bedier has been serving as the city of Tacoma’s director of venues and events for the Tacoma Dome and other nearby properties in Washington. She oversaw a $31 million renovation of the Tacoma Dome that was completed in 2018.



The first phase of OCVibe is scheduled to open in 2024. The full project is scheduled for completion in 2028 when the Honda Center will host volleyball at the Summer Olympics.

Education Health Funding



Education and healthcare remain a key focus of philanthropy for the Samuelis who are providing major funds for a medical campus expansion at the University of California Irvine.



UCI’s $1 billion-plus Brilliant Future campaign includes a $200 million gift from the couple to create the first-of-its-kind College of Health Sciences focused on “interdisciplinary integrative health.” When the Samuelis’ gift was announced in 2017 the university said it was the largest gift in its history.



Samueli Foundation also provided $39 million to UCI toward the construction of an interdisciplinary science and engineering building which opened in February.



“It is important for philanthropists to find a focus for their giving” Henry Samueli told trade publication IEEE Spectrum earlier this year.



“There are too many great things out there that need support and too many interesting projects to fund so you just have to focus and narrow your vision. If you gave a dollar to every person in the world you would have given away $7 billion and accomplished very little. Or you can focus and give much larger gifts to a few programs that will have a huge impact” he said.



The IEEE the world’s largest technical professional organization for electrical and electronics engineers chose Samueli as the recipient of the 2021 IEEE Founders Medal.

Known for its advocacy of technology advancement the IEEE selected Samueli for his “leadership in research development and commercialization of broadband communication and networking technology with global impact.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Red Bull announced in the build-up to the Miami Grand Prix that Newey would leave the team in the first quarter of 2025 calling time on a Red Bull career that spanned almost two decades.

Ted Kravitz questions Zak Brown’s ‘not the first person to leave’ claim

Winning 13 championship titles with the Milton Keynes squad two more likely to follow this season Newey’s departure has been billed as a huge loss for the reigning World Champions.

One that could be compounded if other key personnel also leave.

According to McLaren chief Zak Brown there’s a big possibility that could happen with the American claiming McLaren are receiving many Red Bull CVs. Toto Wolff says he too has seen an uptick in Red Bull personnel applying at Mercedes.

However Red Bull team boss Christian Horner was quick to state that he is not at all worried if “one or two” CVs are dished out after all Red Bull signed “220” personnel from Mercedes’ engine division.

Red Bull’s response to Mercedes courting their personnel

👉 Christian Horner issues Toto Wolff reminder: ‘We took 220’ staff members away from Mercedes

Sky Sports pit lane reporter Kravitz weighed in on the CV argument saying he doesn’t believe Red Bull’s key design staff will leave given Newey’s departure allows them to shine.

“Zak Brown has had his say about Adrian Newey” said Kravitz. “He said ‘I’m not surprised he’s moving on the stuff that’s been going on that is a bit destabilising’.

“Zak wanted to press the point about ‘not the first person to leave Red Bull’ to which Red Bull actually put out a statement to deny it.

“I’m not sure Zak is right on that I can’t see Pierre Waché and Ben Waterhouse all the people underneath Newey going because he went. It doesn’t make sense to me.

“They would be more secure in their role and happier that they can flourish and be the next genius with Adrian leaving the team I would have thought so I don’t think he’s right on that.

“But is what Zak saying about what’s been happening in the power struggle between Christian and Helmut Marko destabilising the team and Adrian’s leaving being a result of that right?

“Well I don’t know. But that is the view of Zak Brown.

“But Adrian did refer in his chat with Martin [Brundle] to events that have unfolded this year. ‘As events unfolded this year’ said Adrian Newey ‘I considered whether it’s time to move on’.”

Ted Kravitz ponders Jos Verstappen’s ‘explode’ claim

But while he didn’t agree with Brown he does think there could be something to Jos Verstappen’s claims earlier this year that Red Bull would fall apart if Horner remained in charge.

Speaking to the Daily Mail when the Briton was investigated for inappropriate behaviour Jos Verstappen said Red Bull would “explode” unless Horner was given the boot.

He wasn’t as the charge was dismissed and now Newey has left.

“I remind you” said Kravitz “about what Jos Verstappen said after all the controversy around Red Bull earlier on in the year. Do you remember? My question is was Jos right?

“Because this power struggle between Christian Horner and Helmut Marko and all of them in the power struggle. ‘There is tension here while he remains in position’ said Jos Verstappen ‘the team is in danger of being torn apart. It can’t go on the way it is it will explode’.

“So is Jos talking about Adrian Newey leaving? And if he was then Jos was right.”

Instead of salting my steak to create a brown crust by searing I created a brown crust with notes of caramel.

Ethan Frisch co-founder of Burlap & Barrel an artisanal spice company that works with small producers worldwide laughed wryly when he heard this story over Zoom. “This is the first time in history anyone could make that mistake. Refined white-bleached sugar is a very modern development in the centuries-old sugar industry. Sugar is brown! It’s only white when you do a lot of work to remove the brownness.”

His co-founder Ori Zohar elaborated: “The whole sugar industry is focused on this pure white chemical that is so far away from being a plant: a shelf-stable consistent interchangeable ingredient. None of those qualities make for good food” though it makes an item that can be traded around the world for similar base prices.

Many of us only know white granulated sugar that comes packaged with no information about its sugarcane or beet origins – much less its geographical origins – on its package. But sugar is diverse. White processed sugar makes up the largest segment of the global market but sugar also comes in liquid and brown forms. About 80% of the world’s production comes from sugarcane but some comes from beets. Even sugarcane itself is not a monolith; though most sugar is derived from the Saccharum officinarum species and its hybrids there are hundreds of varieties which have adapted (or been adapted through human intervention) to their specific ecosystems.

Zohar and Frisch are on a mission to “do to sugar what has been done to salt” in the last few years. You can now buy specialty salts from specific places and have specific characteristics: a black Himalayan salt that has a sulphurous funk or Burlap and Barrel’s Pearl salt from Tanzania’s Swahili coast with its surprisingly spherical crystals.

Saltverk which sells hand-harvested salt from Iceland has been riding this wave. Founder Björn Steinar Jónsson said “People want to know where the products they’re buying are from. We’ve seen this as a gradual growth in the salt industry and really we’re only at the beginning stages of where people understand what’s going into their salts. As a staple ingredient used by most of the world sugar could follow a similar path.”

This is not just marketing. A sugar’s texture and taste can be as individual as coffee beans from a corner of Ethiopia or wine grapes grown on a chilly slope in the Pacific north-west.

Brown sugar from Okinawa in Japan is a favorite of pastry chef Salvatore Martone of Le Jardinier in New York. He said: “Okinawa brown sugar (kokuto) is produced on eight remote Japanese islands. Each island produces sugar that has a slightly different taste. The sugar is sold in small irregular lumps and the flavor is rich minerally smokiness with an earthy undertone and a hint of bitterness.” He uses it for ice-cream.

Burlap & Barrel’s founders want to introduce consumers to sugars connected to a specific place and that have a distinctive flavor born of the environment that produced them. The company’s work expands the market for traceable sugar focusing on sourcing from communities using traditional processing methods.

It’s introduced panela a traditionally unrefined cane sugar from Boyacá Colombia. In June the company is launching two other single-origin sugars jaggery from Satara district India and a granulated sugar from Portvale Barbados. When the company uses the term “single-origin” it doesn’t merely refer to a country of origin but a single farm or producer.

Had I reached for their sand-textured panela in making my steak I could not have mistaken it for salt. Its soft irregular granules are the color of milk caramel with which it shares similar aromas. A spoonful is like sucking on sweet cinnamon toffee. It melts on the tongue leaving a trace of floral spice as if I took a shot of ginger juice.

The jaggery has the varied irregular texture and look of crushed peanuts and opening it fills my apartment with the scent of fresh squeezed sugarcane. It comes from Dr Shashikant Salunkhe who has grown turmeric for Burlap & Barrel as part of a regenerative agricultural system. A local refiner filters the raw sugarcane juice with wild okra whose gel collects any floating impurities. The jaggery is granulated and then stone ground ancient methods that are worlds away from industrial filtration and mechanized refinement.

The Barbadian sugar’s crystals are startlingly angular and crunch loudly between one’s teeth.

“Barbadian sugar has to de-commoditize if they’re going to compete globally” said Frisch. This means that the country’s producers need to embrace their sugar as a specialty product and divert it from being blended with other sugars before it reaches supermarket shelves where it will be simply labeled “cane sugar”. Frisch wants people to understand what makes Barbadian sugar so good – the terroir of its coral island flavors enhanced by molasses cane fed by rainwater and not irrigation like in most industrial practices and its history.

View image in fullscreen Sugar production has an ugly past with roots in slavery and abhorrent working conditions into the present. Photograph: Ethan Frisch

Sugar production has an ugly past. About 5 million slaves were brought to the Caribbean most to toil on sugar plantations starting in the mid-1500s. The slave trade reached its height in the 1700s and Barbados known as Sugar Island was its crown jewel. Abolitionists in Europe and the US waged boycotts of sugar a slave-derived good that represented abhorrent working conditions.

Centuries later Frisch and Zohar want consumers to demand sugars that retain their individual nuanced flavors. “Home cooks and chefs have huge buying power” said Zohar which could advance more sustainable and equitable production. Sugarcane farms are responsible for massive deforestation. Added to innumerable food products sugar drives the global obesity epidemic. Sugar from the Dominican Republic’s Central Romana corporation which is often supplied to and sold as Domino brand has been banned from the US since November 2023 due to allegations about exploitative work conditions and forced labor among its largely Haitian migrant workforce.

But as of the moment it’s difficult to know exactly where your sugar comes from. Non-alcoholic beverage company Everleaf goes to extraordinary lengths to source botanicals. Founder Paul Mathew is a conservation biologist and his company has tracked down “cherry blossoms hand-picked in the Shizuoka region of Japan between May and August” and gum acacia used for mouthfeel from the Sahel region of Africa.

That wasn’t possible with sugar which Mathew said is all being “hoovered up into a commodity-based industrial system”. The UK-based company is currently switching from fair-trade sugar derived from sugarcane to beet sugar from the UK prioritizing a lesser carbon footprint.

One way for a company to know where its sugar comes from is for that business to grow it themself. This is what Copalli Rum in Belize chooses to do. The majority of rum is made from molasses produced when sugarcane juice is boiled multiple times in sugar’s refining process and sucrose is removed. But new agricole-style rums which are made from fermenting fresh sugarcane juice like Copalli are emerging from former commodity sugar plantation fields from Hawaii to Belize. Copalli uses red and black cane instead of yellow cane engineered over many years to produce commercial sugar in Belize.

Wil Maheia the philanthropy services advisor for Copalli has tended to this area his entire life. His great-grandparents worked the land when it was a sugarcane plantation and he helped organize Belize’s first debt-for-nature swap (a transaction where a country’s debt is exchanged for environmental conservation commitments).

He’s proud to say: “We have never cut any rainforest to plant cane.” To the contrary – Copalli is cultivating 220 acres of sugarcane on old citrus orchards rather than reaching into 12000 acres of rainforest. As the largest employer in southern Belize it’s creating jobs that do not rely on the logging industry and deforestation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd2VhdGhlci5jb20vc2NpZW5jZS9uYXR1cmUvdmlkZW8vYnJvd24tYmVhci1jaGFyZ2VzLWF0LWNhci1pbi1qYXBhbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Brown Bear Charges At Car In Japan - Videos from The Weather Channel,"Weather in your inbox

Baking it on a sheet pan eliminates the need to stand at the stove pan-frying slices in batches. And while the oven is on it’s easy to throw in a pan of bacon as well. If you can plan ahead it’s best to start this the night before; the longer the challah soaks in the cinnamon-scented egg mixture the better and more cakelike the result.

Take Elijah Craig for example. On the label it states that it was “Distilled and Bottled at the Elijah Craig Distillery Co.” When you search google it doesn’t bring up a google map of where the Elijah Craig Distillery is. The same thing is true if you find yourself looking at a bottle of Blanton’s. “Blanton Distilling Company” is largely displayed yet it is Buffalo Trace Distillery that produces the whiskey. Even our own Whiskey Reviewer t8ke can have trouble discerning what is craft and what comes from a macro distiller.

Breaking Down the Brands of Major Whiskey Companies

Whiskey companies can have a laundry list of brands which can have multiple products under each label or even multiple distilleries. Now just because similar sounding whiskies are coming from one distillery doesn’t mean they are the exact same or trying to profit off of name recognition but always having transparency and as much information as a consumer is beneficial when deciding where to spend your money. So let’s take a look at the portfolios of the biggest corporations. We will focus on whiskey brands but most also produce different categories of spirits as well.

So as you can see just 8 different corporations account for a massive amount of distilleries and brands in the whiskey world. On top of that these companies are constantly selling to each other or looking to acquire other brands to expand their portfolio and profits. This isn’t an indictment of the whiskey but always interesting to see where some brands that sound completely different can come through the same bottling line

On Friday the S&P 500 index crossed the 4400-mark for the first time while the Dow Jones Industrial Average moved past 35000 and reached a new high. Meanwhile weekly jobless claims increased unexpectedly to around 419000 dampening hopes of labor market recovery.

Continuing its buyout spree Accenture bought two technology companies early this week — Toronto-based Oracle cloud service provider Cloudworks and workforce optimization consultancy Workforce Insight – and completed the previously announced acquisition of France-based cybersecurity firm Openminded.

In another tech deal Microsoft agreed to acquire security start-up CloudKnox. Meanwhile Visa clinched a deal to buy Currencycloud for about 700 million pounds.

The airline industry dominated the earnings scene this week with United Airlines reporting results on Tuesday and Southwest Airlines and American Airlines releasing their second-quarter statements on Thursday. Earlier IBM came out with positive numbers for its most recent quarter on Monday. The next day all eyes were on streaming giant Netflix which published mixed results in the after-hours.

Energy firm Kinder Morgan Seagate Technology Verizon soft drink major Coca-Cola and Johnson & Johnson stole the show on Wednesday. Thursday was as busy as usual with the major events being the second-quarter earnings releases of telecom firm AT&T fast-food chain Domino’s Pizza Biogen Abbott Laboratories Intel as well as social networking platforms Twitter and Snap. Schlumberger American Express and Kimberly-Clark reported Friday before the opening bell.

While Lockheed Martin is probably the only major company to report earnings on July 26 the market will be closely following the report of Alphabet on July 27. The Google parent will be joined by gadget giant Apple chipmaker AMD Starbucks and Microsoft in the after-hours. Before the opening bell aviation firm JetBlue and engineering behemoth General Electric are scheduled to report earnings.

The financial releases of Bristol-Myers Squibb aircraft builder Boeing and Ford Motor are the key events slated for July 28. The next day is going to be as hectic when the earnings announcements of e-commerce giant Amazon.com Altria Group Yum! Brands and Merck & Co. are on tap. Procter & Gamble oil giant ExxonMobil and Caterpillar are among the major companies preparing to report on July 30.

Caesars Entertainment hosted a Strip-side pop-up clinic with COVID-19 testing vaccines and entertainment on Saturday.

The clinic was nestled inside the Jimmy Kimmel's Comedy Club inside The LINQ Promenade.

“We were strolling and we saw the sign and it looked interesting so we came in and just got it done” said Neilson Lin a Las Vegas resident.

 hospitalizations are passing levels we haven’t seen since early February and less than half of Nevadans are fully vaccinated.

“When I heard that they were advising all the other states to stay away from Las Vegas then I started getting a little scared so I thought I should.”

Locals and tourists who got vaccinated Saturday left with prizes ranging from tickets to see Usher's sold-out show a helicopter ride signed Raiders gear and hotel packages from Caesars resorts.

While big vaccination sites worked for the early days of getting Nevadans vaccinated Gov. Steve Sisolak said vaccines need to meet people where they are.

“We’ve seen some international folks that we’ve seen at these events where they’re from Mexico Costa Rica Colombia” said Sisolak.

Fernanda Gonzalez from Mexico City is one of them.

“At first I was a little bit scared. I thought it was going to be painful but it wasn’t. It was super quick and I even got some tickets for a show” Gonzalez said.

Get vaccinated -- it's even a plea from local entertainers Penn & Teller.

""We have tested it out. It's completely safe it's saving lives it's opening up Vegas"" Penn Gillette said.

Walt Disney executives won't be traveling to Las Vegas next month to attend the National Association of Theatre Owners' CinemaCon.

The company cited growing concerns over the Covid-19 delta variant for why it's skipping out on the annual gathering of cinema owners and Hollywood studios at Caesars Palace according to a report from The Hollywood Reporter. Disney will screen one of its upcoming movies instead of holding a staged presentation.

The news comes nearly a week after NATO publicly decried Disney's day-and-date release of ""Black Widow."" It is unclear if this was a factor in the studio's decision.

Representatives for Disney were not immediately available to comment.

For a decade CinemaCon has been a star-studded event for studios theater owners and the media to meet network and share upcoming content and cinema innovations. The pandemic sidelined last year's conference however and could still impact this year's event.

As of Friday the rest of the major studios remain committed to staging in-person presentations although expectations are that fewer stars will be present during the four-day convention.

While NATO is requiring attendees to present proof of vaccination or a negative Covid test taken within 48 hours of the event many within the film industry have expressed concerns about the recent surge in coronavirus cases. There are rumblings that other studios which were on the fence about attending prior to Disney's departure may follow suit.

Last week the White House declared southern Nevada which includes the city of Las Vegas a ""sustained hotspot"" for the virus. This means that the area has a high number of cases and may be at risk of experiencing health-care resource limitations.

Los Angeles County officials have warned residents against traveling to Nevada and reinstituted mask mandates for indoor settings for all vaccinated and unvaccinated people. Las Vegas however is not requiring tourists to wear masks indoors.

Representatives for the National Association of Theatre Owners declined to comment.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoZWF0c2hlZXQuY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvZGluZXJzLWRyaXZlLWlucy1hbmQtZGl2ZXMtbW9zdC1vdmVyLXRoZS10b3AtYnVyZ2Vycy1vZi1hbGwtdGltZS5odG1sL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Diners Drive-ins and Dives' Most Over-the-Top Burgers of All Time,"Guy Fieri has eaten a ton of burgers all across this country as the host of ‘Diners Drive-ins and Dives.’ While almost all of the burgers look good not all of them get him to take a second of third bite. Let’s take a look at some of the most over-the-top burgers of all time.

Diners Drive-ins and Dives host Guy Fieri has tried a number of burgers on his popular Food Network show. He’s seen everything from veggie burgers to shrimp burgers to crocodile burgers.

When fans see Fieri try a dish on DDD that means he likes it. If he really likes it he’ll take a second bite or even a third — just like he did with this list of the show’s most over-the-top burgers of all time.

‘Diners Drive-ins and Dives’ featured the Peanut Butter Burger from Sabores

Fieri visited Sabores in Logan Utah where he tried their popular Peanut Butter Burger. You might not think that peanut butter and a burger patty would taste good together. But customers say it’s quite the combination.

The Peanut Butter Burger at Sabores features a homemade chipotle aioli cheese bacon tomato onions a generously seasoned beef patty and — of course — peanut butter.

Yes it’s a burger made entirely of bacon

Diners Drive-ins and Dives featured Dr. Field Goods Kitchen in Santa Fe New Mexico which has a handy butcher shop just a few doors down. The owner’s fusion of BLT and burger became the “Bad Ass BLT” which features a nine-ounce patty made entirely of bacon.

Served with mayo lettuce tomato and freshly baked potato bread made on-site this burger has a flavor that can’t be beat.

‘Diners Drive-ins and Dives’ found one of their most over-the-top burgers in a BBQ joint

The WTF burger from Cochon Volant BBQ Smokehouse in Northern California is topped with prime brisket brined smoked pork shoulder and chipotle-scented pork cake.

The griddled burger also features sautéed onions cheddar cheese a combo of mayo and house Carolina barbecue sauce and house-cured maple bacon. To top it all off the pork cake is drizzled with chipotle sauce.

The Firehouse Burger is topped with three-pepper hot sauce

When Fieri tried the Firehouse Burger from Lankford Grocery in Houston Texas he compared it to “licking the volcano of FlavorTown.”

The Diners Drive-ins and Dives host visibly struggled while taking a few bites of this spicy burger that features cayenne-spiked butter and homemade three-pepper hot sauce.

When Fieri tasted the sauce made from serrano jalapeño and habanero peppers with vinegar garlic onion radish and loads of mustard he said it was so spicy that it might “cook raw chicken.”

The sandwich itself features American cheese more jalapeños onion tomato and pickle.

One of the most outside-of-the-box burgers on ‘Diners Drive-ins and Dives’

When Fieri visited Ethos Bakery & Café in Washington state he described their burger as a Bentley with “monster truck tires.”

He also called the burger created by former engineer Angela Kora “one of the most outside of the box burgers” he’s ever had on Triple D.

The burger features homemade croissant dough rolled into the shape of a burger bun that’s baked and split. It’s then topped with an eight-ounce burger patty that’s marked on the grill. Then finished in the oven with rosemary-infused butter and topped with cheddar cheese.

The Mac Attack Burger is ‘the dictionary definition of comfort food’

The Boston Burger Company’s Mac Attack Burger is what Fieri calls the “dictionary definition of comfort food.”

The juicy patty is topped with house-made mac and cheese that has a blend of American cheddar and jack cheese. The mac is seasoned with parmesan and pecorino as well as a dash of hot sauce.

They chill the pasta overnight and then grill it to order. While topping each hand-made burger patty with even more cheddar and jack cheese. The Mac Attack is also topped with bacon that’s cooked-to-order.

“I’ve seen ridiculous in the burger world” Fieri says while praising the burger’s attention to detail. “This might have to be a contender.”

He was 93.

Mason died Saturday at 6 p.m. ET at Mt. Sinai Hospital in Manhattan after being hospitalized for over two weeks the celebrity lawyer Raul Felder told The Associated Press.

The irascible Mason was known for his sharp wit and piercing social commentary often about the differences between Jews and gentiles men and women and his own inadequacies. His typical style was amused outrage.

""Eighty percent of married men cheat in America. The rest cheat in Europe"" he once joked. Another Mason line was: ""Politics doesn't make strange bedfellows marriage does."" About himself he once said: ""I was so self-conscious every time football players went into a huddle; I thought they were talking about me.""

Mason was born Jacob Maza the son of a rabbi. His three brothers became rabbis. So did Mason who at one time had congregations in Pennsylvania and North Carolina. Comedy eventually proved to be a more persistent calling than God.

""A person has to feel emotionally barren or empty or frustrated in order to become a comedian"" he told The Associated Press in 1987. ""I don't think people who feel comfortable or happy are motivated to become comedians. You're searching for something and you're willing to pay a high price to get that attention.""

Mason started in show business as a social director at a resort in the Catskills. He was the guy who got everybody up to play Simon Says quiz games or shuffleboard. He told jokes too. After one season he was playing clubs throughout the Catskills for better money.

""Nobody else knew me but in the mountains I was a hit"" Mason recalled.

In 1961 the pint-sized comic got a big break an appearance on Steve Allen's weekly television variety show. His success brought him to ""The Ed Sullivan Show"" and other programs.

He was banned for two years from the ""Sullivan"" show when he allegedly gave the host the finger when Sullivan signaled to him to wrap up his act during an appearance on Oct. 18 1964.

Mason's act even carried him to Broadway where he put on several one-man shows including ""Freshly Squeezed"" in 2005 ""Love Thy Neighbor"" in 1996 and ""The World According to Me"" in 1988 for which he received a special Tony Award.

""I feel like Ronald Reagan tonight"" Mason joked on Tony night. ""He was an actor all his life knew nothing about politics and became president of the United States. I'm an ex-rabbi who knew nothing about acting and I'm getting a Tony Award.""

Mason called himself an observer who watched people and learned. From those observations he said he got his jokes and then tried them out on friends. ""I'd rather make a fool of myself in front of two people for nothing than a thousand people who paid for a ticket"" he told the AP.

His humor could leap from computers and designer coffee to then-Sen. John Kerry former Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and Donald Trump. He was able to articulate the average Joe's anger making the indignities of life seem funny and maybe just a little bit more bearable.

""I very rarely write anything down. I just think about life a lot and try to put it into phrases that will get a joke"" he said. ""I never do a joke that has a point that I don't believe in. To me the message and the joke is the same.""

On TV Mason was a reliable presence usually with a cameo on such shows as ""30 Rock"" or ""The Simpsons"" or as a reliable guest on late night chat shows. He performed in front of Britain's Queen Elizabeth II and his show ""Fearless"" played London's West End in 2012.

He portrayed a Jewish ex-pajama salesman in love with an Irish-Catholic widow portrayed by Lynn Redgrave in a series called ""Chicken Soup"" in 1989 but it didn't last. During the O.J. Simpson murder trial the British Broadcasting Corp.'s Scottish service hired Mason as a weekly commentator.

Mason's humor sometimes went too far as when he touched off a controversy in New York while campaigning for GOP mayoral candidate Rudolph Giuliani against Democrat David Dinkins who was Black. Mason had to apologize after saying among other things that Jews would vote for Dinkins out of guilt.

Felder his longtime friend told the AP that Mason had a Talmudic outlook on life: ""That whatever you would say to him he would start an argument with you.""

He is survived by his wife producer Jyll Rosenfeld and a daughter Sheba.

Here's The Answer.,"Almost two years ago I started describing what I call a Capability Academy and the concept has really picked up speed. Well we just published a whole research report on the topic and in this topic I’ll give you some specific examples.

First most companies have over-rotated toward skills. Of course we all need skills to do our jobs well but this is really nothing new. I entered the workforce in 1978 and I’ve been developing technical professional and business skills ever since. It’s a never-ending part of your career.

Our research shows that there are three “types” of skills in business: technical professional and soft skills (which I call PowerSkills).

Technical skills include hundreds of technologies topics systems and processes. We all need to know how to type read use Excel and even write code. These technical skills are broad and deep and they are always changing. Lots of research shows that technical experts “top out” in their careers early so even tech professionals have to constantly refresh their technical skills. And if you work in pharmaceuticals energy manufacturing accounting or other industries there are hundreds of technical skills required to do your job.

These technical skills are broad and deep and they are always changing. Lots of research shows that technical experts “top out” in their careers early so even tech professionals have to constantly refresh their technical skills. And if you work in pharmaceuticals energy manufacturing accounting or other industries there are hundreds of technical skills required to do your job. Professional skills are the things your profession demands. If you’re an HR professional for example you better learn how to interview people recruit create performance plans and many other domain-specific things. We identified 94 of these professional skills in our Global HR Capability Project and each is complicated in its own way. Consider “Employment Branding” for example. It requires skills in marketing communications SEO analytics and lots of other things – all applied toward a particular professional problem.

are the things your profession demands. If you’re an HR professional for example you better learn how to interview people recruit create performance plans and many other domain-specific things. We identified 94 of these professional skills in our Global HR Capability Project and each is complicated in its own way. Consider “Employment Branding” for example. It requires skills in marketing communications SEO analytics and lots of other things – all applied toward a particular professional problem. Power skills (or soft skills) are all the human relationship teamwork and leadership skills we need. This ranges from listening and communications (the #1 most in-demand skill) to leading teams empathy patience inspiration and dozens more.

When you study this topic you quickly find that all three of these areas are essential and over time we build these skills in a contextual way. We learn them by doing things not just by studying. You can go to a course in Java or Leadership and feel good when you’re done but you don’t really know how to program or lead until you’ve done it. And that means you need projects feedback mentors coaches and lots of stretch assignments.

In a company this means lots of “learning by doing.” So no matter how good the L&D department is nobody really learns much until managers and career coaches help you “do” and “learn” on the job. And this has been the core of my research on Learning in the Flow of Work.

In my case I learn something every day. Yes every single day. I listen to others attempt to drive projects make decisions – and every day I learn something new. So I’m building “capability” all the time.

So how do you develop facilitate and support this process in a structured directed way? Enter the Capability Academy.

Defining A Capability Academy

Rather than build a course catalog or a “University” of training a Capability Academy is focused on… yes.. building capabilities. The two best examples of these are Sales Academies and Leadership Academies.

A Sales Academy is usually run by the head of sales (not the head of L&D) and there is a senior sales executive who runs it. He or she puts together all sorts of curricula programs simulations and ongoing events to make sure salespeople are always ready to sell. He or she probably looks at new hire training product training sales skills negotiation skills and all sorts of industry and solution skills.

Ericsson for example has built an entire 5G Academy for its sales and engineering teams. 5G is not just a stack of technologies: it’s new business models new application solutions and a whole new way of positioning what Ericsson does. So your Sales Academy has to include tenure-based programs assignments and even peer-based assessment. Cisco used to force sales leaders to be “credentialed” by their peers to reach a senior level.

Great leadership academies are similar. They aren’t just a few courses for managers or leaders. They include all sorts of external speakers industry education simulations case studies and self-assessment. And as anyone who runs leadership development knows the process is built on succession management developmental assignments and lots of job rotation. All that falls into the Academy structure.

Our Academy (The Josh Bersin Academy) is also a great example. We did start with a series of courses but then we added research assessments a capability model and now a whole set of Senior Faculty and developmental journeys. Soon we’ll be adding developmental assignments and all sorts of other activities for your HR organization. All with the goal of continuously building deeper relevant useful capabilities in the important work of human resources.

(Read about the HR Capability Project here.)

How Do You Get Started

As the research points out a Capability Academy is not a library of courses. It’s a capability-centric organization that should be led by a business leader not an L&D professional. When Capital One got started with cloud-based digital technologies they assigned the CIO to lead their Digital Academy. He worked with one of the senior L&D leaders to build out the curricula developmental assignments and investments in content.

When Cemex built its Safety Academy or Supply Chain Academy they partnered with the CEO and heads of operations. When Pepsi built its Finance Academy the CFO was the sponsor. You get the idea: this is your opportunity to make a strategic decision about what capabilities really matter and focus your attention in these areas.

You shouldn’t build a Capability Academy for everything. All companies need training in compliance diversity operations and management. These may or may not warrant an Academy structure. As I like to put it draw a 2X2 grid and figure out what capability areas drive competitive advantage for your company.

The following chart will help. This is an analysis I developed years ago when I wrote The Training Measurement Book and it still applies today. Look at the capability areas that are strategic (they drive competitive advantage) unique (they’re not just off-the-shelf topics) and urgent (if you don’t address them now your company won’t grow).

This 2X2 is a good exercise for any L&D or HR team. Take all your L&D programs from onboarding to DEI to compliance and see where they fit. And what you’ll find is that you can “outsource” a lot of the ones at the bottom left and bottom right and they may or may not justify an Academy. That leaves your budget to focus on the most strategic areas of all.

Long ago I spent a lot of time at Caterpillar and one of their most important capability areas was channel partners. They like many manufacturers make most of their money by training supporting and developing their resellers distributors and partners. So they have always had an “Academy” structure for channel sales and support.

Bottom Line: Skills Are Not The Whole Answer

I know everyone is interested in skills taxonomies and intelligent AI-based skills systems. And even if they worked perfectly all they’d do is recommend the “perfect training” for every employee at a given time. But would they build capabilities? Likely not. It’s the experience exposure coaching and feedback that help people grow. The Academy gives you the structure to do this well.

We have become quite experts at putting these strategies together. If you’d like some help figuring out your Capability Academy strategy please give us a call.

Head to the airport.,"As airline call times have reached unthinkable levels this summer I have been trying to figure out how to successfully avoid the long wait times to speak to an agent and I may have cracked the code.

Earlier in the summer I learned through trial and error that calling early in the morning (so early it could be considered the middle of the night) yields shorter wait times than usual and texting or tweeting the airlines sometimes yields faster results as well. But there is one solution I've found that has worked better than all other methods: going to the airport and speaking to a ticketing agent in person.

I used this method during my most recent international trip when the Delta flight I was taking from San Francisco to Paris was hit with major delays that would have upended my travel plans.

My original itinerary had my partner and I fly from San Francisco to Paris with a quick layover in Atlanta. Things were looking great; My Main Economy tickets had been upgraded to Comfort+ due to my Gold status and I was generally just excited to be headed back to my favorite country for a week of family time fun nights out and great food.

The night before our flight I was going over all of my documents to make sure that I had everything I needed to enter France smoothly and was just about to eat dinner when I got a text alert on my phone from Delta. The alert stated that our aircraft had been changed and we had been bumped from Comfort+ back to Main Economy. This should have been my first sign that something was awry but I didn't read too much into it and continued on with my night. A few hours later I was just about to go to sleep when I grabbed my phone to set an alarm for my early wake-up call. It was only then that I realized that I'd just missed another text alert from Delta -- this one much more alarming.

My original flight from San Francisco to Atlanta had now been delayed by six hours and was now leaving at 2:00 pm! Realizing that this delay meant my partner and I would miss our connecting flight from Atlanta to Paris I shot out of bed and immediately called the Delta helpline to rebook our flights. As expected an automated message told me that the current hold time would be around two hours which was not going to work.

Instead of playing the waiting game I put on some clothes and shoes ordered an Uber and headed straight to the airport.

After a short Uber ride (around five minutes as I was staying at the Hilton San Francisco Airport Bayfront) I arrived at the airport and made a beeline to the ticketing counter. There were only three employees working because it was so late at night -- two agents helping at the baggage kiosks and one sole employee handling all of the ""special services"" cases at her kiosk. I took my place in the ""Special Services"" queue and waited somewhat patiently until the Delta agent finished up with the person in front of me. This took about 15 minutes from the time I was dropped off at the airport.

When I made it to the counter I explained my situation to the ticketing agent who informed me that the flight delay was most likely due to Hurricane Elsa which was making its way up the East Coast that week. However she was luckily able to find us another flight that landed in Paris around the same time as our original flight but with a layover in Minneapolis instead of Atlanta. Even better she secured us the last two Comfort+ seats on the longer leg from Minneapolis to Paris.

The agent fixed our entire itinerary in a matter of 15 minutes and just like that we were headed back to the hotel with our new boarding passes in hand. The very best? She was able to do all of that as well as confirm that all of the documents we needed were in order and filled out correctly.

Related: France adds US to 'green' list: I'm in the country now — here's what it's like and what to expect

When we got back to the hotel it was around 1:40 AM making the total rebooking time -- from driving to the airport waiting in line to speak with the ""special services"" agent getting rebooked and set up with our new boarding passes and getting back home -- around one hour and 10 minutes. And keep in mind that this entire time I was still on hold for Delta's customer service line on my cell phone.

Of course it would have been much easier and so much more convenient to sort out all of my flight issues from the comfort of my own home (or hotel room) but until the call lines are back down to pre-COVID wait times finding creative solutions like this may just be the way to beat the system. My advice for those needing help with flights ASAP? Save yourself the elevator music headache and instead just head to the airport!

View the current offers here.

TPG senior news editor Clint Henderson recently described his third pandemic-era trip to Hawaii as ""easy breezy beautiful."" If you've also got Hawaii on your mind -- and just about any transferrable currency in your pocket -- you can use today's domestic award sweet spot to fly to Hawaii on Delta-operated flights.

In this guide I'll describe how to leverage the Air France/KLM Flying Blue program to fly round-trip between the mainland U.S. and Hawaii for just 35000 Flying Blue miles plus minimal taxes and fees. Don't worry if you don't have any Flying Blue miles yet though. Flying Blue is a transfer partner of multiple transferrable currencies including American Express Membership Rewards Capital One Rewards Chase Ultimate Rewards and Citi ThankYou Rewards.

Why it's special

Frankly there are many ways to get to Hawaii using points and miles. For example I recently wrote about how you can fly to Hawaii from 13000 Avios each way. And you can also fly to Hawaii for just 15000 Turkish miles round-trip. So redeeming 35000 Flying Blue miles for an economy-class round trip isn't the lowest cost award you'll find to Hawaii. And if you can find a non-stop Delta award of fewer than 3000 miles redeeming Virgin Atlantic Flying Club miles may provide better value.

But if you want to fly a longer Delta non-stop flight or Delta-operated connecting flights to Hawaii you should consider the Air France/KLM Flying Blue program. After all if you can find award space you can frequently book Delta-operated awards from mainland U.S. to Hawaii with the Flying Blue program for far less than with Delta Skymiles. And unlike many of the Hawaii award flight sweet spots you're not limited to west-coast gateways. Instead assuming you can find award availability you can fly from anywhere in the mainland U.S. that's served by Delta.

After logging in you can enter your desired flight details. I recommend searching for a one-way award for one passenger unless you must travel in a larger group.

(Screenshot courtesy of klm.nl)

After clicking the ""Search flights"" button you may get a message stating ""Sorry there are no fares available for this date. Please try again."" If you get this message you may need to go back to the start to search for availability on a different date since this page often acts buggy. But if you happened to search for a route and date with availability you'll see some award options on the next page.

(Screenshot courtesy of klm.nl)

If you found an award option that works for your trip click the green box that shows the rate. Doing so will take you to a page where you can see the details of your award ticket.

If this summary is correct and you want to continue with your booking click ""Continue to passenger details."" If you have enough miles in your account you can enter the passenger details for your award and complete the booking. But if you don't have enough miles in your account you'll see the following error: ""Unfortunately you do not have enough Miles for this booking. Please select a different flight."" I don't have enough miles in my account so this is as far as I can guide you through the booking process.

Bottom line

There are many ways to use points and miles to fly to Hawaii. Today I discussed one method: redeeming Air France/KLM Flying Blue miles for Delta-operated flights. This method isn't best for everyone but it can provide excellent value for central and east coast U.S. residents. And since there's no benefit to booking this award as a round trip you could book an open-jaw itinerary and visit two (or more) Hawaiian islands. Then you could book your inter-island Hawaii travel separately.

Finally before transferring points to Flying Blue check cash rates for your award. We've recently seen some excellent deals including Hawaii flights from $81 each way. If you're looking to transfer Chase Ultimate Rewards points you may get a better deal booking travel through the Chase Ultimate Rewards portal when paid rates are low. And you can redeem Capital One miles at a fixed rate toward new or existing travel purchases. So although you can often get excellent value by transferring points it's always worth checking cash rates too."

Last year 2684 residents died from drug overdoses a 14 percent increase over 2019 with 42.5 percent of those individuals being Black. Lockdowns and other pandemic restrictions isolated those with drug addictions and made treatment harder to get experts said.

Michael Bouchard the Oakland County sheriff said three of his daughter’s soccer teammates died from drug overdoses adding “it’s just anecdotally what’s happening across the country.”

Through July 19 the sheriff’s office has already responded to 65 overdose-related calls this year compared to 86 total calls responded to in 2020. On April 4-5 deputies actually responded to three separate overdose calls two in Pontiac and one in Addison Township where Narcan was administered to reverse the effects of the drugs.

Bouchard believes two factors contributed to the increase in overdose deaths after 2-3 years of deaths decreasing statewide. Between 2017 and 2019 the number of overdose deaths declined from 2686 to 2354.

“During the pandemic there was obviously a great deal of isolation anxiety and depression” he said. “That led to a lot of activity that was self-medicating in a variety of ways including opioids. We had scenarios where people weren’t going out and weren’t going to work or socializing. People were stuck in an environment where basically they sometimes got depressed and looked to do things that weren’t always the healthier good choice.”

Health experts say there’s no current evidence indicating how many of the drug overdose deaths in 2020 were among new users or how many American started using drugs last year.

Rather Shannon Monnat an associate professor of sociology at Syracuse University who researches geographic patterns in overdoses said the increased deaths most likely were people who had already been struggling with addiction.

Some have told her research team that suspensions of evictions and extended unemployment benefits left them with more money than usual. And they said “When I have money I stock up on my (drug) supply” she said.

As the number of deaths climbed across the state the number of opioid prescriptions dispensed decreased in 2020 by 3.82 percent compared to 2019. according to Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs data from 18.4 million to 17.7 million. MDHHS data shows 376 million opioid pills were prescribed.

In addition to increased isolation and anxiety Bouchard said the amount of fentanyl an often-abused and powerful opioid crossing the Mexican border is up 43 percent. In 2019 a total of 1458 Michiganders overdosed and died on synthetic opioids.

In 2019 more than 51 percent of all drug overdose deaths were attributed to fentanyl a synthetic opioid 100 times stronger than morphine and other synthetic opioids according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta (CDC).

“You’ve got more products and you’ve got conditions where individuals are using it” said Bouchard. “Fentanyl tends to be either the opioid of choice or kind or mixed in with heroin or other kinds of things to increase its potency.”

While prescription painkillers once drove the nation’s overdose epidemic they were supplanted first by heroin and then by fentanyl in recent years. Fentanyl was developed to treat intense pain from ailments like cancer but has increasingly been sold illicitly and mixed with other drugs.

According to the CDC provisional data Fentanyl was involved in more than 60 percent of the overdose deaths last year nationwide.

The proliferation of fentanyl is one reason some experts do not expect any substantial decline in drug overdose deaths this year. Though national figures are not yet available there is data emerging from some states that seems to support their pessimism.

According to The University of Michigan there have been 1233 fatal drug overdoses statewide through July 20. Nearly 8000 doses of Narcan have been administered by Michigan first responders. At that rate the number of overdose deaths in Michigan will again surpass 2000.

This is a trend that was mirrored nationally with a record 93000 people dying of drug overdoses including 57550 from synthetic opioids last year according to the CDC reflecting the coronavirus pandemic’s toll on efforts to quell the crisis and the continued spread of illicit fentanyl.

The provisional estimate far eclipses the high of about 72000 drug overdose deaths reached the previous year.

“This is a staggering loss of human life” said Brandon Marshall a Brown University public health researcher who tracks overdose trends. He added that the nation was already struggling with its worst overdose epidemic but clearly “COVID has greatly exacerbated the crisis.”

Amy Dolinky senior advisor for opioid strategy at the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) said continuing statewide education and community outreach and engagement efforts is key to reversing this trend of increasing drug overdose deaths and overall use.

“I think the state has made great progress” she said. “All of our local partners have made great progress in trying to make services accessible to folks throughout the pandemic. There’s been a lot of work done to be able to try to keep that potential increase (in the number of deaths) down.”

Some of that work includes continuing to bring opioid prevention and education services and resources to people where they are at by transitioning from in person to telemedicine.

Although state-run programs continue to work to support those with drug addictions and in turn help bring down the overall number of potential drug-related deaths new data from The University Michigan indicates that residents are continuing to die from drug overdoses at alarming rates.

According to the university’s injury prevention center there have been 1233 fatal drug overdoses statewide through July 20. Nearly 8000 doses of Narcan have been administered by Michigan first responders. At that rate the number of overdose deaths in Michigan will again surpass 2000.

Dolinky also mentioned the state’s syringe service program that encourages safer drug use the ability of EMS providers to leave behind doses of Narcan and emergency departments being able to use medications to treat opioid abuse disorder.

“We have kind of a new picture on the needs of people across Michigan and we’re able to really focus” she said. “Even though we’re transitioning to a new normal we know that the impacts of the pandemic and the impacts of the overdose crisis impact each community. Our local partners really have had their eye on what their specific community needs are.”

On Wednesday Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel and state attorneys general across the country announced the details of a proposed $26 billion opioid settlement with Johnson & Johnson and the three largest pharmaceutical distributors in the country: Cardinal Health McKesson and AmerisourceBergen.

The historic agreement would resolve the claims of both state and local governments across the country including the nearly 4000 that have filed lawsuits in federal and state courts. The agreement also requires significant industry changes that will help prevent this type of crisis from ever happening again.

Michigan is estimated to receive up to nearly $800 million from these drug manufacturers over the life of the settlement to pay for opioid addiction and prevention services.

In October 2017 Oakland County and Wayne County filed a joint lawsuit against opioid manufacturers and distributors alleging deceptive marketing practices that have led to increased use and deaths.

Oakland County Executive Dave Coulter said the county joined other Michigan communities in suing the companies because officials saw firsthand how dangerous a public health crisis opioid addiction had become.

“The money both the state and county will receive will provide some justice for individuals and families impacted by prescription addiction by funding intervention treatment and other services” he said. “There is however more to be done. My administration will continue to work with local health care systems community partners and the Oakland County Board of Commissioners to have a plan to use these funds to address treatment and prevention of future addiction.”

Under the settlement arrangement the states will have 30 days to review the documents and then make a sign-on decision. After that local units of government will have 150 days to do the same.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wb3N0Z3VhbS5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC91cHdhcmQtb2YtMTBtLWZvci1ndWFtLWluLW9waW9pZC1zZXR0bGVtZW50L2FydGljbGVfOTZhNjliY2MtZWFiOS0xMWViLWEwYjYtODMxMjNjZjk0Yjc2Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Upward of $10M for Guam in opioid settlement,"Guam could receive upward of $10 million to help combat the island's drug epidemic as part of a $26 billion proposed national opioid settlement with Johnson & Johnson and three of the largest pharmaceutical distributors in the country: Cardinal Health McKesson and AmerisourceBergen.

Attorneys general have been engaged in ongoing efforts to hold the companies responsible for the opioid epidemic seizing the nation according to the Guam Office of the Attorney General.

""Actions speak louder than words"" Guam Attorney General Leevin Camacho stated in a release. ""We’ll continue to deliver on the promise we made to secure more resources to fight Guam’s drug problem.""

The $10 million will be the largest non-tobacco settlement Guam has ever received. It will be paid out over 18 years and the majority of the money must be spent on the treatment and prevention of opioid abuse and co-occurring substance abuse or mental health conditions.

The national settlement was initially reached by all parties in October 2019 and they've been working on the specifics of the settlement since according to the OAG.

State attorneys general revealed details of the proposed settlement Thursday.

State negotiations were led by attorneys general Josh Stein of North Carolina Herbert Slatery of Tennessee and the attorneys general from California Colorado Connecticut Delaware Florida Georgia Louisiana Massachusetts New York Ohio Pennsylvania and Texas.

Guam Deputy Attorney General Fred Nishihira and Assistant Attorney General Joseph Perez from the OAG Consumer Protection Division handled the case for Guam.

Following Thursday's agreement territories and states have 30 days to join the deal meaning Camacho has 30 days to review and sign the settlement.

Local governments in participating states such as municipalities will have 150 days to join. Ratification of the agreement is contingent on a ""critical mass"" of territorial state and local governments participating according to the OAG.

""This settlement comes as a result of investigations by state attorneys general into whether the three distributors fulfilled their legal duty to refuse to ship opioids to pharmacies that submitted suspicious drug orders and whether Johnson & Johnson misled patients and doctors about the addictive nature of opioid drugs"" the OAG stated.

""The agreement would resolve the claims of state and local governments across the country including the nearly 4000 that have filed lawsuits in federal and state courts. The companies have also agreed to make significant industry changes in their business practices to help prevent this type of crisis from happening again"" it added.

The announcement follows another settlement earlier this year when the OAG announced that Guam would receive nearly $280000 for a $573 million multi-state settlement with McKinsey & Company one of the largest consulting firms for Purdue Pharma and other opioid companies.",,,,,,,,,

Nineteen-year-old Marquis Desade Scottland was taken into custody and faces the following charges: Illegal possession of a regulated firearm restriction on possession of ammunition possession of firearm/ammo of minor firearm/drug trafficking crime wear/carry/transportation of a weapon controlled dangerous substance (CDS) possession with intent to distribute prescription medication CDS controlled dangerous substance near a school and obstruction and hindering law enforcement according to authorities.

Frederick County Sheriff's deputies were working the Urbana carnival when they spotted a Black man later identified as Scottland wearing a shoulder back with the distinct outline of a gun which could be seen through the bag.

Deputies approached Scottland who ran away and a chase occurred. Authorities say Scottland was captured and taken into custody.

According to investigators deputies conducted an initial search of Scottland and his bag which was empty. A handgun was found in a grass field used for carnival parking.

These range from issues pertaining exclusively to pandemic readiness (like our domestic capacity to produce personal protective equipment ventilators sanitizer and vaccines) to matters that are considerably less esoteric like the ability of global supply chains to operate regardless of the various stresses put upon them.

The latter goes far beyond the toilet paper supply issue experienced early in the pandemic. It expands to include a whole range of products like lumber and other building materials tools foodstuffs seeds furniture cleaning supplies aluminum cans jars pools and pool equipment chemicals bicycles camping gear household appliances and replacement parts of all kinds.

In many cases supply chains have been simultaneously squeezed on both ends — supply and demand.

Production and distribution disruptions

While unscheduled closures of manufacturing and distribution facilities bottlenecks at borders and sick workers have caused choke points in supply lines people being cooped up in their homes for months on end have driven up demand for a host of products.

There has also been a simultaneous shortage of labour particularly in the licensed trades.

Throw in other disruptors like the massive winter storm in Texas in February the six-day blockage of the Suez Canal due to the grounded ship Ever Given in March and the six-day closure of the Colonial gasoline pipeline in the United States after a cyberattack in early May.

Also include the fact that shipping containers are being lost in record amounts for various reasons with more than 3000 going overboard in 2020 and the 2021 number already hitting 1000 by the end of April.

The pandemic has shown us that global supply chains are a huge house of cards: fragile enough on a good day but prone to come tumbling down when there’s an unexpected breeze.

This has been particularly apparent with the manufacturing of computer chips.

The demand for microchips

Prior to COVID-19 there was already great pressure on the production of microprocessors microcontrollers motherboards and the like due to limited global production capacity and greater calls for product. The pandemic has placed additional pressure on an already pressed segment as production and distribution bottlenecks have been met with increased pandemic-driven demand.

Not so long ago disruptions in the production of microchips tended to impact only the manufacture of smart phones tablets computers external hard drives and more recently flat screen televisions.

Today however such disruptions also impact the production of automobiles as chips are increasingly being used in power steering and braking systems car infotainment systems and other components. Indeed both General Motors and Ford Motor Company have idled a number of plants in North America due to the global semiconductor shortage. And being relative newcomers to the microprocessor market automakers don’t have the clout that other buyers have often leaving them out in the cold when supplies dry up.

The situation for automakers is only expected to get worse as more and more consumer goods get smart via wifi or Bluetooth connectivity.

The growing list of items that require microchips is disconcerting as these components are almost solely manufactured in some of the riskiest places in the world from a natural disaster perspective: China Japan Taiwan South Korea Malaysia Thailand the Philippines and California.

This has to change. We need more manufacturing facilities for microchips and these must be located in places with low risk to natural and other hazards.

Securing supply chains

But whether we are talking about microchips wood chips or potato chips corporations need to get intimately familiar with their supply chains if they aren’t already: What they get how often in what quantities from whom from where how and why. Business continuity contingency plans and workarounds must be put in place ahead of time to deal with what-if scenarios. Risk managers — either in-house or third-party consultants — need to be in on these discussions as do boards of directors.

Corporate insurance buyers and risk managers must understand the differences in key insurance coverages like standard business interruption and contingent business interruption and ensure that they have proper financial protection in place.

Finally and from a big picture perspective society needs to get a better idea of where choke points exist (both at the manufacturing and distribution levels and in the physical world) so these can be addressed eased or even eradicated. Further we need to do more research into understanding how consumers behave in the face of crises. The emerging fields of behavourial economics and decision science have much to contribute to this discussion.

It’s a different world out there a more interconnected and a more dangerous one. And we are currently learning the hard way that global supply chains don’t operate on auto pilot.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndlYXJldGhlbWlnaHR5LmNvbS9wb3B1bGFyL2FtZXJpY2FuLWNhcnJpZXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US aircraft carriers are almost unsinkable giants of the ocean,"The USS America was a Kitty Hawk-class supercarrier first built in the 1960s and served through the Vietnam War Cold War clashes and on into Desert Storm. Decommissioned in 1996 the Navy decided the ship's best post-service use was as a target. America would help design the newest fleet of supercarriers to be even less vulnerable to enemy fire than she was.

The America did not go down easy. For four weeks the Navy hit the ship with everything they could muster short of a nuclear weapon.

Even today the wreck lies in one piece at the bottom of the ocean near Cape Hatteras. Despite the Navy's best efforts they just could not sink the indefatigable carrier. The last time any carrier was lost to battle damage in combat was in World War II where 12 such ships were sent to the bottom after heavy fighting. The America didn't engage in combat but the attacking forces were out to hit her as if she had. The sinking of America was a test run for vulnerabilities in American aircraft carrier designs.

The good news is that China is going to have a really hard time doing it even if they use an intercontinental ballistic missile. The bad news is that it's somehow possible to sink these floating behemoths and if done could kill up to 6000 American sailors. Still good luck getting close.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cmFzaWFudGltZXMuY29tL2dsb2JhbC1oYXdrLWRyb25lcy1sb2NraGVlZC1ub3J0aHJvcC1pbi1iaWctcmFjZS10by1yZXBsYWNlLXVzLWFpci1mb3JjZXMtYWdlaW5nLW9ic29sZXRlLXVhdnMv0gF9aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZXVyYXNpYW50aW1lcy5jb20vZ2xvYmFsLWhhd2stZHJvbmVzLWxvY2toZWVkLW5vcnRocm9wLWluLWJpZy1yYWNlLXRvLXJlcGxhY2UtdXMtYWlyLWZvcmNlcy1hZ2Vpbmctb2Jzb2xldGUtdWF2cy8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Global Hawk Drones: Lockheed Northrop In ‘Big Race’ To Replace US Air Force’s Ageing Obsolete UAVs?,"There are speculations that US defense giants Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman could be in the race to offer a successor to US Air Force’s (USAF) Global Hawk drones.

The USAF is determined to replace its fleet of RQ-4 Global Hawk drones deemed obsolete by the service in view of emerging threats from adversaries such as China.

Testifying before the Senate Appropriations Committee Lt. Gen. David S. Nahom US Air Force Deputy Chief of staff for plans and programs said that the successor of the RQ-4 Global Hawk is expected to be inducted into the USAF service by the end of this decade.

Lt. Gen. Nahom said that the existing Global Hawk fleet is inadequate against modern air defenses and its replacements are on the way reported Air Force Magazine.

At “the speeds it flies the altitudes it flies and the makeup of the aircraft it’s just not survivable in these contested environments that we’re going to be looking to gather intelligence from in the future” the top Air Force official said referring to Block 40 Global Hawk.

However it is said that E-8 Joint STARS and the Global Hawk will be used to meet the Ground Moving Target Indicator mission. Nahom also reiterated that the Global Hawks will be extremely significant in the coming six to eight years while the USAF decides about their replacement.

He also admitted that the threat has accelerated much more in the past few years. Also present at the Committee meeting Senator Richard Shelby pointed out that China’s strong economic base makes the Asian country a much bigger threat than the Soviet Union ever was during the Cold War.

Similar concerns were voiced by Air Force General Charles Brown earlier this year when he stated that many legacy intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance platforms are found to be unable to deliver “needed capabilities on competition-relevant timelines”.

It was recommended that such platforms be phased out and resources be invested in modern and relevant systems.

The Global Hawk Drones

Developed by Northrop Grumman the RQ-4 Global Hawk is a high-altitude long-endurance remotely piloted aircraft. Equipped with an integrated sensor suite it can conduct intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) missions during day or night and in all-weather conditions.

According to the USAF the Global Hawk provides a broad spectrum of ISR collection capability to help the combatant forces in various peacetime contingency and wartime operations.

The aircraft is 14.5m in length is 4.7 m high and has a wingspan of 39.8 m. The speed of the aircraft is 357 mph and the average range is 12300 nautical miles. It has been in operation with the USAF since 2001 and has more than 250000 flight hours in missions supporting military operations in Iraq Afghanistan North Africa and the Asia-Pacific region.

As the USAF seeks to replace it the two likely contenders to the Global Hawk seem to be Lockheed Martin’s TR-X and Northrop Grumman’s RQ-180

Lockheed Martin TR-X

US defense giant Lockheed Martin believes its new TR-X will be a capable replacement for the USAF’s Global Hawk as well as U-2. The “high-flying hard-to-see drone” is expected to incorporate the designs of both the U-2 and the Global Hawk reported Popular Mechanics.

The TR-X is expected to operate in ISR missions at altitudes of about 70000 feet. According to reports the aircraft may have stealth features of the other Lockheed designs such as the F-22 and F-35 aircraft.

It is expected to have “swept-back wing mainplanes outward cranked tail fins and a dorsal intake set aft of the nose”. Mission equipment is expected to be located internally with a built-in modular payload capability.

It would be 16 m long 4.50 m high and have a wingspan of 21 m. equipped with a General Electric F 118 Turbofan engine to provide an estimated 20000 lb of thrust. Currently under development the TR-X is expected to enter service by 2025.

In 2016 Lockheed had proposed a 10-year program to deliver 30 aircraft. Explaining the similarities with the Global Hawk Lockheed Martin’s U-2 business development manager Scott Winstead said that the aircraft will have the “same 130-foot wingspan as the Global hawk to prevent basing issues with existing hangars”.

Winstead further mentioned that the TR-X will have a newly designed straight wing which will be complemented by low-observable (LO) shaping. The LO and the electronic countermeasures will provide adequate defense against detection by surface-to-air missile systems.

The Northrop Grumman RQ-180

Another contender to replace the Global Hawk is the Northrop Grumman RQ-180 stealth unmanned aerial vehicle. The RQ-180 has its design motivated by advanced broadband all-aspect very low-observable (stealth) requirements reported The Drive.

The RQ-180 can operate as a networking and reconnaissance platform which can fly deep into enemy airspace. Flying as high as 70000 feet the RQ-180 is expected to outpace fighters and drones in enemy airspace and be capable of gathering line-of-sight data from the F-35 and B-21 Multi-function Advanced Data Link (MADL) systems and F-22’s stealthy Infra-Flight Data Link (IFDL).

The stealth reconnaissance drone RQ-180 has been operational since 2017 The National Interest had reported. Though the USAF never officially acknowledged the fact it is believed that the RQ-180 had been based in Guam to support the radar-evading drone in the Pacific region. It is believed that the USAF had tested the RQ-180 at Groom Lake in Nevada near the Area 51 complex. Missing In Action – Why Indian Navy Has Been ‘Shying-Away’ From Using Its Aircraft Carriers In Major Conflicts?

The RQ-180 has extensive stealth features such as a unique body shape and coatings to avoid detection by enemy radars. It is based on the same form and function as that of the Lockheed RQ-170 Sentinel though it has a more enhanced endurance envelope.

It is 40 m long 10 m high and has a wingspan of 50 m. It is equipped with one turbofan engine and has a ceiling of 12200 m and a range of 3900 km. The drone will be equipped with mission-specific payloads related to its intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance missions.

Many experts believe that the RQ-180 has a striking resemblance to another Northrop Grumman manufactured product the B-2 and the B-21 Raider Bomber.

Last year The EurAsian Times had also reported that the RQ-180 was photographed by actor Rob Kolinsky when the stealth spy drone flew over his house. In an Instagram post he mentioned a similarity with the B-21 and stated “this thing flew over my house several weeks ago and I still have yet to identify it”.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiJGh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9zd2lzcy0yMDIxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The SWISS Fleet In 2021,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiJGh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9zd2lzcy0yMDIxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWlnaHR3YXZlcy5jb20vbmV3cy80LWNoYWxsZW5nZXMtb2YtZHJheWFnZS1hbmQtdGhlLWZyZWlnaHR0ZWNoLWNvbXBhbmllcy1zb2x2aW5nLXRoZW3SAWhodHRwczovL3d3dy5mcmVpZ2h0d2F2ZXMuY29tL25ld3MvNC1jaGFsbGVuZ2VzLW9mLWRyYXlhZ2UtYW5kLXRoZS1mcmVpZ2h0dGVjaC1jb21wYW5pZXMtc29sdmluZy10aGVtL2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,4 challenges of drayage — and the FreightTech companies solving them,"Drayage in its simplest form is the transportation of freight from an ocean port to its initial inland destination. These moves tend to average no more than 50 miles taking containers to rail yards to be put on a train or sending them to nearby warehouses to be sorted segmented and routed to their next destination.

While the distances are comparatively short the logistics of routing 11 million maritime containers in and out of ports every year has its full share of challenges.

Below are four facets of drayage logistics that are often difficult to manage — and some FreightTech providers’ solutions.

Shipment visibility

Before drayage movements can even take place containers need to reach their destination ports. Without visibility into those containers’ locations shippers cannot plan inventory or optimize warehouse teams and most importantly they may lose customer satisfaction with late deliveries.

Project44 CEO Jett McCandless explained how his company brings visibility to shippers looking to plan properly for incoming containers.

“Our AI-powered algorithms process a massive amount of data for the most accurate predictions of when those containers can be picked up. … Those same advanced algorithms are integrated with hyperaccurate vessel sailing schedules and detailed cargo rolling data to help the shipper select the best possible carrier and vessel booking to avoid the worst of the port congestion” he said of project44’s ability to integrate with its recently acquired visibility partner Ocean Insights to optimize the container planning process.

Project44 went a step further for customers this spring providing visibility into Asia where many customers’ supply chains began.





“With the Ocean Insights acquisition project44 became the world’s leader in ocean visibility much of that product coming out of Asia Pacific” said Chief Product Officer Vernon O’Donnell. “The inevitable next step for us was connecting that first leg of the journey in China and that really became even more pressing for us to get done.”

Also vital is the right visibility software which has quickly become table stakes in the world of FreightTech. Companies like freight forwarder platform Logixboard are helping customers offer a customized visibility experience for global shippers. The company is able to provide better insight into their drayage logistics with very little onboarding time.

“Freight forwarding companies reach out to us as more of a defensive mechanism” CEO Julian Alvarez told FreightWaves. “They’ll tell us ‘One of my biggest customers is threatening to leave if we don’t have this digital experience.’ The great news for them is we’re able to solve for that and implement that quickly.”

Customs clearance

Much like personal travel moving goods across borders can be overwhelming. Incorrect documentation inaccurate payments and misclassification of products are just a few circumstances that often prevent shipments from reaching their final destinations.

In personal travel most documentation is the same across borders. In drayage the lack of standard paperwork processes in global shipping can hold up shipments once they have reached their port of destination.

The global trade platform Flexport recently partnered with application provider Scale AI to manage and improve customers’ international paperwork processes and better prepare them for customs clearance.

“There’s a lot of different document types in international shipping like commercial invoices bills of lading airway bills and arrival notices. Almost every logistics company I talk to isn’t getting the results they’re looking for when it comes to document management because the solutions in the market today are designed for perfectly executed paperwork” said Melisa Tokmak the general manager of document AI at Scale AI.





“In the world of logistics that’s not happening. Sometimes words are crammed. Sometimes it is very hastily submitted or submitted as a photo. These are very complicated documents because you’re including customs information descriptions amounts and unit prices.”

Using document managing systems like those Scale AI has created for Flexport customers eliminate delays in drayage caused by paperwork issues.

“The moment you have any conflicting information across your documents you are increasing the chance of containers being opened by customs and that has incredibly downstream metric effects on your trucks the warehouses waiting for the goods and overall decreasing customer sentiment” said Tokmak.

Delays for reshuffling

A study by Assistant Professor Amir Gharehgozli at Texas A&M University found that one of the biggest delays in maritime shipping comes from reshuffling or shifting containers at ports of destination.

Gharehgozli an industrial engineer found that the more dedicated the stack of containers was to a specific destination the fewer reshuffles were needed throughout that ship’s journey.

Turning this concept into a technology solution is the drayage platform EDRAY which uses the volume leverage of its customers’ containers to stack all of those containers together enabling the company to optimize the carrier capacity needed to make these pickups.

“Let’s say a company has 200 containers coming in this week. Now they are teaming up with other shippers to bring in 1000 containers and combine all of the drayage carriers available bringing more capacity for a more efficient pickup without having to wait and incur detention fees” said industry entrepreneur Andrew Leto who recently invested $7 million in the platform.

Solving the stacking problem alone has improved customers’ drayage processes by 40% according to EDRAY.

Leto noted that while shippers are happy about the improvements carriers get to participate in a more efficient drayage community.

“You now have all these drayage shippers teaming up with a lot more freight to offer these carriers reducing costs for them and giving carriers more business to choose from” Leto said.

Carrier capacity

While capacity is tight in all areas of transportation lack of capacity to pick up container shipments creates a problem for the global shipping community. If a container is not picked up on time it not only incurs detention costs but it adds to the global container shortage affecting prices all over the world.

The importance of having capacity available at all times spurred the recent partnerships between Flexport and the digital freight network Convoy. Many of Flexport’s customers were using Convoy to facilitate these drayage pickups so the two companies integrated their systems to create full visibility of a shipment from its international origins to its final delivery destination all in one location.

“Flexport’s goal is to make global transport easy and accessible for everyone. In doing so they’re trying to solve their customer problems like capacity. … I think that common passion for not building technology for technology’s sake but building towards this common mission of making things better for customers is what drives our partnership” said Convoy President and COO Mark Okerstrom.

Other companies like visibility platform Terminal49 have leveraged drayage carrier relationships to offer capacity strategy tools that other companies do not have enough experience to build.

CEO Akshay Dodeja explained that after building a successful drayage company he was able to develop relationships with various ports and the regional capacity providers enabling him to optimize their asset volume for his customers’ drayage pickups.

“We took our carriers and turned them into partners” he said. “Our trucks got the software for free and it allows them to access the cargo for importers ranging from five to 200 containers a month. Their operations teams now have the tools and data to expedite cargo pickups and eliminate extra charges reducing their overall drayage costs.”

It was the last of many letters some typed others handwritten he had sent me through the years.

Carle who died in May often sent me pictures too sometimes a collage that he was working on. One was of a yellow duck — it looked more like a chicken — that was wearing pinstripe trousers and had big light-pink feet. Another was of a man and his wife sitting in their kitchen eating cake with chocolate frosting. But the image of the man was upside down. (“It’s not a mistake” he wrote. “It’s just how they eat cake.”) He said it was part of a “nonsense book” that he hadn’t finished yet.

In some of his letters he described his childhood and early education in Syracuse N.Y. where he was born in 1929. He said that he had “a perfectly happy kindergarten year” and a first-grade teacher “old Miss Frickey” whom he remembered fondly because she was “kind and supportive” about his love of drawing. But he said that his parents who were German immigrants returned to Germany in 1936 when he was 6 years old and that his teacher at a school in Stuttgart was a cold unfriendly person who had no interest in the artistry of children. He called the man “a monster.”

It was out of the grimness of those dark and loveless days that he believed he had evolved his longing for bright and joyful colors. Under a glorious collage of a multicolored angel that he mailed to me one winter he had written “Homage to Paul Klee” who he said was “my favorite artist” and “painted many angels the earliest recorded when he was 5 years old.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndsYnQuY29tLzIwMjEvMDcvMjYvYXJteXdvcm1zLXdvcnNlLXNvLWZhci10aGlzLXN1bW1lci10aGFuLXJlY2VudC15ZWFycy1ob3ctcHJvdGVjdC15b3VyLXlhcmQv0gF6aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2xidC5jb20vMjAyMS8wNy8yNi9hcm15d29ybXMtd29yc2Utc28tZmFyLXRoaXMtc3VtbWVyLXRoYW4tcmVjZW50LXllYXJzLWhvdy1wcm90ZWN0LXlvdXIteWFyZC8_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Army worms worse so far this summer than in recent years how to protect your yard,"JACKSON Miss. (WLBT) - They fly over from South America every spring and wreak havoc on people’s yards every summer and fall.

Armyworms are back in Mississippi.

Mississippi State University Extension Agent Kyle Lewis said they are worse now than in recent years.

Despite the name an armyworm is actually a caterpillar that grows into a moth. Lewis said they remain in their caterpillar stage for about 10-14 days and do most of their feeding in the last two to three days. He said this could cause serious problems for those in hay production.

“A producer can be riding around looking at hayfields ready to harvest and two to three days out from harvest they can be bringing equipment to the fields and basically most of their production is gone” Lewis said.

Aside from hay fields they also like Bermuda grass and turf. He said one of the first signs that armyworms might be in your yard is if you start noticing small patches of dead grass.

“Scouting is probably the best preventative method” Lewis said. “You have to sometimes get down on your hands and knees and crawl around and part the grass and look.”

There is not a whole lot you can do to prevent them from invading your yard but Lewis said homeowners and farmers could get rid of them with certain chemicals.

“We use some pyrethroids permethrins spinosad” he said. “You get over into the pasture side and there might be some other products you may need to throw in there with a tiny mix.”

Lewis said he is not really sure why they are worse this year. Since they can’t survive the winters in Mississippi and fly in from further south as a result he said they are hard to predict.

To learn more about how to combat armyworms he said to visit Mississippi State University Extension’s website.

At his home on Montreal's South Shore Roger Giraldeau makes his way to his nursery.

Opening the door he delicately lifts up a mason jar filled with water. Milkweed leaves are protruding from a hole in the metal cover.

""These are my babies"" he said pointing to the black yellow and white-striped caterpillars clinging to the leaves.

Those caterpillars are about halfway through their metamorphosis. From egg to caterpillar to chrysalis they will then reach their final form: Monarch butterflies.

But the 100 or so caterpillars in Giraldeau's nursery wouldn't be here if it weren't for him.

He searches and saves eggs before the plant they're on gets mowed down for landscaping along highways or in shopping mall lands.

""People always ask me what is the use of a butterfly? And I always turn it back to them and ask what is mankind useful for? We destroy everything"" he said.

""I try to help those who have no chance of surviving.""

Surviving for Monarch butterflies is getting harder and harder.

Scientists believe the population of the butterflies has diminished by as much as 80 per cent since the 1980s.

Tracking the diminishing Monarch population

At the Montreal Botanical Garden Alessandro Dieni kneels down over an imported species of milkweed called Asclepias curassavica or tropical milkweed.

""[The Monarchs] come all the way from Mexico simply to feed and to complete their life cycle — and they can only do that with the presence of milkweed"" said the co-ordinator of the Botanical Garden's Monarch Mission campaign.

""It's the only plant that the caterpillars can feed on.""

It's also where the butterflies lay their eggs.

This week amateurs and experts alike across North America are taking part in the International Monarch Monitoring Blitz.

Participants simply input their observations online after spotting milkweed plants eggs or any form of the butterflies.

""The aim of that blitz is to gather a better picture a better snapshot of what's going on in Canada"" Dieni said.

What's going on isn't good news. Pinpointing the reasons behind the decline isn't simple but in Canada partly to blame is loss of habitat: The precious milkweed plant.

Montreal's field of Monarchs

You don't have to go very far to find a Monarch habitat in danger of disappearing.

In Montreal's west end next to the Trudeau International airport lies a huge swath of land many refer to as the Technoparc Montréal although the 200 hectares of woods and fields there have no official name.

""We have everything here. We have wetlands we have mixed wood forest we have swampy forest and we have this open space that is excellent for a variety of species that would hunt and feed here including the Monarch butterfly"" says Katherine Collin an amateur birder and member of the TechnoParc Oiseaux a group fighting for the land to be protected.

Past the forest and in the fields are thousands upon thousands of milkweed plants a haven for the Monarchs who come in the summer.

A large portion of the land is owned by the federal government but leased to the administration in charge of the airport Aéroports de Montréal (ADM).

It's land the agency hopes to develop.

""There are indeed negotiations underway with a company that would like to set up in the northern sector of the airport site"" ADM spokesperson Anne-Sophie Hamel confirmed to Radio-Canada.

Members of TechnoParc Oiseaux can't understand why there isn't a will to protect the butterflies.

""I won't advance the case that habitat loss in Montreal is as serious as habitat loss in their migratory destination in Mexico"" said Collin.

""But it's still a grave threat because the urban habitat loss that we see if we're doing away with milkweed then the Monarchs don't have anywhere to come to reproduce and begin their trajectory back. So yes it's a serious threat.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjYXJ5bW9tbXkuY29tL3BhcmVudGluZy9tb20tbG92ZWQtYnV0dGVyZmxpZXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,My Mom May Be Gone But I Found An Incredible Sign From Her In My New Home,"A Boston native I recently moved to Tampa suburb in search of more sunshine literally and figuratively. The perfect storm of a pandemic a divorce and a medical scare facilitated a half-life crisis I could not ignore.

I am currently living in a town I had never even heard of a few short months ago. I originally put an offer on another home sight unseen before I even stepped foot on Tampa soil. I didn’t get it thankfully but that bold move prompted me to get on a plane to explore my possibilities.

During that trip there was one home that greeted me with seemingly endless butterflies. It was like nothing I had ever experienced in my 48 years of life and instantly made me feel like I was finally where I belonged. I felt compelled to share how those four walls brought me full circle in my grief journey in the form of a letter.

To the family of the woman who owned my new home

As soon as I walked into your beloved mom’s beautiful home I knew it was the one for me. The sky high ceilings distinct layout architectural flair and tranquil pool all made an everlasting impression but the little butterfly decal on the sliding glass door was the thing that got me. As I approached the door in disbelief to take a closer look brilliant butterflies artfully fluttered in the backyard gracefully making their appearance known.

It gave me the chills. I’ll explain why.

Before my mom died of ovarian cancer in 2013 I asked her how she would communicate with me after she passed knowing how desperately I’d miss her. “I’ll send butterflies” she said her eyes welling up with tears.

Sadly I didn’t see a single butterfly for more than one year after she died. One day I was so overwhelmed by grief that I drove to a butterfly place just to be around them hoping for a sign. That sign eluded me until I walked into your mom’s home almost eight years after my mom’s untimely death.

My mom delighted in butterflies; she devoured books about them traveled to Costa Rica and the Galapagos and everywhere in between to find them and talked about them incessantly; so much so that there’s a butterfly etched on her grave. I know she is with me here applauding my bold decision to move to Florida with my kids to break out of my cocoon and begin again.

You see my children have also dealt with unspeakable grief. They both lost their dad to kidney cancer in 2018; my bonus daughter also lost her mom to breast cancer when she was just four years old. Collectively we have been utterly consumed by loss at times but choose to live in hope in the spirit of my mom. She was beyond resilient and they are too.

When I read your incredibly lovely and thoughtful note after the closing I related to the fresh pain you’re feeling right now. My mom’s death truly gutted me; I have never been the same. She was my pure unfiltered source of light in a sometimes dark world; my loudest cheerleader as I chased — and fulfilled — the wildest of my dreams; the most nurturing and present grandmother to my children. The words you chose to describe your mom echo in my mind as I use many of the same adjectives when I write about mine.

I am certain it was hard to pack your mom’s possessions and trust the universe that her home would be cared for. I want you to know that I intend to do just that to fill it with love and laughter and children and hopefully grandchildren and great grandchildren one day just like her — to continue building on the foundation she built. You are most welcome to visit us anytime.

I’ll leave you with my mom’s favorite quote which is especially true during times of grief: “Just when the caterpillar thought the world was over it became a butterfly.”

Please know that I will never remove your mom’s butterfly decal. It will remain in my home in her honor and in tribute to my mom.

My next children’s book Goodnight Star Whoever You Are is coming out on October 26th in anticipation of Children’s Grief Awareness Day.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFiYy5uZXQuYXUvbmV3cy9ydXJhbC8yMDIxLTA3LTI1L2ZhbGwtYXJteS13b3JtLzEwMDMwNjU0ONIBKGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmFiYy5uZXQuYXUvYXJ0aWNsZS8xMDAzMDY1NDg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Invasive insect fall armyworm on the march but scientists fight back with an oozing virus and an egg-attacking wasp,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.abc.net.au/news/rural/2021-07-25/fall-army-worm/100306548 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFiYy5uZXQuYXUvbmV3cy9ydXJhbC8yMDIxLTA3LTI1L2ZhbGwtYXJteS13b3JtLzEwMDMwNjU0ONIBKGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmFiYy5uZXQuYXUvYXJ0aWNsZS8xMDAzMDY1NDg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

They didn't have to look far: there was already a running list of potential successors fast-growing restaurant chains beloved by customers and already on Wall Street's radar. They included Zoe's Kitchen Potbelly El Pollo Loco and most recently Noodle Company.

Following its food-poisoning troubles however Chipotle hunkered down and has since reclaimed and surpassed its annual sales levels reaching just under $6 billion in revenue in 2020. Wall Street meanwhile has welcomed the brand back with open arms with Chipotle's stock reaching an all-time high this past Thursday after its second-quarter earnings report beat stock exchange forecasts according to CNBC.

How did Chipotle right itself? Beset by public health scandals (which didn't end in 2015 but cropped up again in 2017 and 2018) restaurant closures and a sudden loss of more than half a billion dollars in revenue the chain could very easily have lost its position as a fast-casual darling and become stuck in a lower industry tier—the fate of so many of the restaurants driven into bankruptcy by the pandemic. Instead it is now punching above its weight not only leading its own segment of the restaurant industry but ranking among the top ten highest-grossing chains across all segments.

Here's a look at what exactly happened to Chipotle in 2015 and how it managed to bounce back in the following years. For more check out This Once-Popular Chicken Restaurant Chain Is Falling Out of Favor With Customers.

A string of food poisoning incidents

Chipotle had experienced public health issues as early as 2008 when some of its restaurants were linked with outbreaks of hepatitis and norovirus in California and Ohio respectively. Nothing could have prepared it for 2015 though when between the months of July and November the chain was implicated in no fewer than six food poisoning incidents involving E. Coli salmonella and norovirus.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

An outbreak of norovirus at a Simi Valley Calif. location that August led to a joint investigation by the U.S. Attorney's Office of California and the CDC as well as a class-action lawsuit. The chain made national headlines again in October when E. Coli outbreaks in Washington and Oregon made 22 people ill and forced the temporary closure of 40 restaurants. The CDC launched a four-month investigation into the matter and Chipotle's stock price quickly dipped 12% as customers were completely put off.

A damaged business model

As Restaurant Business pointed out in a recent article on the topic the real damage of the food poisoning scandal wasn't to Chipotle's year-over-year sales growth but to its very business model. Up until late 2015 Chipotle's claim to fame in the restaurant industry was the speed with which its new units reached high levels of profitability—about two years on average to see margins of 28%. In the months following the E. Coli and norovirus scandals with sale losses that would reach $600 million Chipotle's average profits sank to 15%—solid to be sure but well below the rate at which it had until then sustained its growth.

Pivoting to off-premise on time

Following the 2015 outbreaks and a media-wide pile-on targeting its ""Food with Integrity"" slogan Chipotle quickly course-corrected shoring up its annual U.S. sales by the end of 2017 and then launching into 2018 with a new CEO and company headquarters.

In a move that immediately increased their stock price by over 12% the fast-casual brand brought on Brian Niccols formerly the CEO of Taco Bell to help regain their industry footing. Under Niccol's leadership the Denver-based company relocated to Newport Beach Calif. and as early as 2019 began investing heavily in mobile-ordering and off-premise expansion with close to 2000 locations outfitted with ""digital makelines""—computer-assisted assembly lines dedicated to off-premise orders.

Things are looking up way up

In other words Chipotle was becoming off-premise before ""off-premise"" was a thing. By mid-2020 as other major chains were scrambling to adapt to greatly increased demand for mobile ordering takeout and delivery services the chain found itself well-equipped to meet those needs.

Chipotle's preparation had paid off and in July of 2020 the forward-thinking brand reported average annual sales of $1 million among its digital make-lines. Benefiting as well from its ground-breaking ""Chipotlanes"" (drive-thru lanes dedicated to mobile orders) Chipotle outperformed all of its competition during the pandemic and finished 2020 as the tenth highest-earning restaurant chain in the U.S. Not to mention the company continues to lead the way in issues like sustainability and minimum-wage increases winning its favors with a new generation of customers.

CB,Chubb Limited,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnByb2Zvb3RiYWxscnVtb3JzLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA3L2Jyb3ducy13aWxsLW5vdC10cmFkZS1rYXJlZW0taHVudNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Browns Will Not Trade Kareem Hunt,"The Browns are once again a popular pick to make a deep postseason run and their talent at running back is one of many reasons why. The depth chart is topped by Nick Chubb who has earned two Pro Bowl nods in three professional seasons and whose 5.2 YPC average underscores his excellence. Behind Chubb of course is Kareem Hunt a similarly capable runner who is also a force in the passing game.

When the Rams lost Cam Akers to an Achilles tear last week there was chatter that LA could look to the free agent or trade markets to replace him. While the Rams have indicated they are comfortable with their in-house options Hunt would profile as an intriguing trade target for any RB-needy team given the Browns’ depth (Cleveland is also rostering third-year pro D’Ernest Johnson who has played well in limited snaps and sixth-round rookie Demetric Felton).

Hunt’s trade appeal is heightened by the fact that he is tied to eminently reasonable base salaries of $1.3MM and $1.35MM over the next two seasons. However Mary Kay Cabot of Cleveland.com (subscription required) writes that the Browns have no interest in trading Hunt.

As Cabot observes the Browns did not suffer much of a drop-off at all when Hunt replaced an injured Chubb for a few games in 2020 and she expects the club to continue to expand Hunt’s role. Thanks to Hunt’s receiving prowess he and Chubb could appear on the field together a great deal this season which will only make a potentially explosive offense even more dynamic. So regardless of whatever injuries or underperformance rival clubs might experience this summer Hunt will not be made available.

Our Lady of Lourdes Church in Chicago has been around for 125 years and acted as the primary church for three surrounding neighborhoods of Ashland Avenue.

The church held its first mass in October 1892 and was physically moved in 1929.

It took the efforts of 50 men and their horses to pry the 10000 ton church from its foundation move it across the street and rotate it 90 degrees. According to a Chicago Ancestry site the church was moved at a 'foot a minute.'

'It is a magnificent historically and architecturally significant church' said church preservation advocate Julie Sawacki on the steps leading to the church's entrance. 'Imagine tearing something so significant down.'

The church in its present form was built in 1916 and moved across a street by 50 men and horses in 1929

The Archdiocese of Chicago told CBS News that attendance at the church's Sunday masses have steadily declined.

The church simultaneously needs $2 million worth of repairs and without the community's support its likely it will be demolished.

There are a group of parishioners including Hilda Correa who are desperately trying to save the famed religious landmark. Correa and others say the church attracts tourists both Christian and non-Christian.

Correa also alluded to the fact that times are hard. Although she didn't specify what she was talking about - perhaps the years-long pandemic or stubborn inflation - Correa says the church is a place of comfort for those who come to visit.

Hilda Correa left and Julie Sawacki right as well as a number of others passionate about keeping Our Lady of Lourdes alive made impassioned pleas on the steps of the church before its last service on May 19

'The religious aspect is really what's really touching us because losing such a valuable place that people can come especially in these days...'

Our Lady of Lourdes will be holding its final service on May 19 but Preservation Chicago a non-profit organization dedicated to saving city landmarks plans to revive the church and make it into a holy shrine.

'The effort here will probably be long and labored perhaps. There's a lot of different moving parts and a lot of different factors' said Preservation Chicago Executive Director Ward Miller.

There is a Change.org petition with 1107 signatures to preserve the church as a historical landmark rather than knocking it down. The goal is to reach 1500 signatures.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vbmV3c3Jvb20uY2h1cmNob2ZqZXN1c2NocmlzdC5vcmcvYXJ0aWNsZS9jaHVyY2gtb2YtamVzdXMtY2hyaXN0LXJlc3BvbmRzLXRvLW1ham9yLWZsb29kaW5nLWluLXJpby1ncmFuZGUtZG8tc3VsLWJyYXppbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Church of Jesus Christ Responds to Major Flooding in Rio Grande Do Sul Brazil,"PHOTO-2024-05-08-12-51-59[13].jpg Missionaries from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints help load emergency supplies from an Azul airplane onto a truck at a military airport in Canoas Brazil following severe flooding in the Rio Grande do Sul state Brazil May 8 2024.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is sending humanitarian aid to those affected by the recent rains in Brazil’s southern state of Rio Grande do Sul. Some 200000 people have been forced out of their homes with at least 90 people dead and more than 130 missing.

The Brazil Area Presidency has assembled staff and resources to assist those affected by the floods. A letter sent to bishops and stake presidents from Elder Joni L. Koch Brazil Area President and his counselors Elder Arnulfo Valenzuela and Elder Mark D. Eddy all General Authority Seventies states that 21 meetinghouses are now being used as shelters for evacuated people and thousands of basic food packages provided by the Church to the state Civil Defense have already begun to be distributed to the population.

Missionaries from the Church helped unload emergency supplies from an Azul airplane at a military airport in the city of Canoas on Wednesday May 8. Working with Azul Airlines the Church is planning to send an aircraft from Saõ Paulo to Porto Alegre with supplies donated by the Church on Thursday May 9.

Other humanitarian aid initiatives are underway in close coordination with the government to help the community. The Church’s Welfare and Self-Reliance and Family Services departments are coordinating support and efforts to meet the needs of members as well.

Authorities consider the flooding the state’s worst-ever crisis caused by natural disasters.

News reports say some 80% of the population is without running water right now a week into the flooding. Many also do not have telephone or internet services.

The airport bus station and main roads are all blocked or closed going into the capital of Porto Alegre — and more than two-thirds of the nearly 500 cities in the state are affected by the flood waters. Field hospitals have been set up to help those affected.

Social media posts on the Church’s Autossuficiência Brasil and Brazil Area accounts of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints also explain that the Church is responding to the disaster.

Thousands of essential items are being donated including basic baskets mattresses bedding and blankets hygiene kits cleaning kits drinking water personal protective equipment and tools.



These donations are being coordinated in collaboration with the State Civil Defense. Also local church leaders are coordinating efforts to help the community.

“[T]he Brazil Area office is mobilized to do everything possible to help and help the population of Rio Grande do Sul our dear brothers and sisters and friends at this time of great sorrow” the post said in Portuguese.

The post goes on to say that Church members who want to make donations to those affected by the calamity can do so through official government organizations that are coordinating donations through civil defense and social funds.

Some of the cities in Rio Grande do Sul — roughly the size Ecuador — were already suffering from at least three previous major floods in less than eight months.

The rains are expected to continue in the area along with high winds.

The prohibition order was issued on May 7 by Port Jervis Code Enforcement Officer David Rivera.

Mayor Dominic Cicalese was saddened by the situation.

“We hope we find some sort of remedy to the situation. It is a sad situation. Deerpark Reformed Church is conveniently located on our East Main Street and has been a part of our community forever” he said.

Designated as the city’s oldest church the 30 East Main Street structure was built in 1868 for a congregation whose roots extend to 1737 early Dutch settlers.

The structure had been undergoing what current owners said were minor repairs and remodeling in anticipation of a planned public opening hoped for this summer.

A partner in MLR said he and others were in the building this week and last as work was being done on an empty lot next door – the former Sullivan Avenue School property currently owned by the City of Port Jervis. This partner said he was told by a DPW employee that bases were being installed for the Rotary Club to place flags in.

As backhoes and construction hammers were drilling in the blacktop he said he and others in the church felt vibrations strong tremors and loud sounds he described as earthquake-like.

He said he placed a call to the DPW and was told that this work had been approved to assist with an also-approved Rotary Club project. That project which is currently underway is the Rotary Club’s annual Flags for Heroes project which raises scholarship funds for graduating local seniors through community tributes to heroes.

On Tuesday of this week it was discovered upon entering the historic place of worship that a section of the ceiling had collapsed onto the pews and a portion of the sanctuary.

While the partner feels the structure roof and beams remain sound engineers have been called for an assessment to take place next week. He said repairs will require a tremendous amount of money to be invested but current owners remain committed to making sure the structure is rebuilt and preserved.

The plan is to continue for worship purposes as well as to serve as a community cultural center. The structure contains a theatre stage banquet hall and two acres of land and the owners say much public interest has been expressed for these uses. They continue to see a tremendous public benefit and potential for this historic building.

No one was able to be reached for comment from the DPW or building department. Rotary Club President Howard Kuperman said the Rotary Club is a community service organization and simply placed flag poles into receptacles as part of their annual fundraising scholarship effort.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVhc3RpZGFob25ld3MuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvY2h1cmNoLWVtcGxveWVlLWFsbGVnZWRseS1zdGVhbHMtb3Zlci0zMzAwMDAtZnJvbS1wcmVzYnl0ZXJpYW4tY2h1cmNoLW9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Church employee allegedly steals over $330000 from Presbyterian church organization,"IDAHO FALLS — A 31-year-old church employee was arrested after she allegedly stole over $330000 from a local Presbyterian organization.

Kaitlyn Fisher was charged with three counts of felony grand theft on May 3.

Court documents say on Oct. 14 2022 an employee of the Presbytery of Kendall reported that Fisher the administrative clerk had been embezzling from church funds.

The Presbytery of Kendall is an organization that oversees the Presbyterian churches in the eastern Idaho area. According to a church newsletter obtained by EastIdahoNews.com Fisher was the administrative executive assistant.

EastIdahoNews.com has attempted to contact the Presbytery of Kendall by phone and email for comment and we are awaiting their response.

The reporting party told police the staff had not met for annual financial review meetings since the COVID-19 pandemic. During this time she repeatedly asked Fisher who acted as a secretary and bookkeeper for a summary of the church organization’s financials.

In October 2022 the board of trustees chair obtained the organization’s bank statements after asking the banks directly.

In the statements the employees reportedly discovered “numerous unauthorized purchases and transfers out of both accounts via Venmo and Paypal as far back as 2020.”

The two employees confronted Fisher on Oct. 10 where she allegedly admitted to making the unauthorized transfers and purchases.

On Dec. 6 an Idaho Falls Police officer contacted Fisher about the allegations and she denied stealing the money.

Over a week later the officer contacted a criminal investigator with the Idaho State Tax Commission who was able to issue and serve subpoenas for Fisher’s PayPal and Venmo account records.

In the transaction history investigators discovered at least $338458 worth of unauthorized purchases made from Fishers account allegedly using church funds between January 2019 and October 2022.

According to police reports Fisher used the money to buy a red 2018 Honda 4-wheeler from Action Motor Sports to pay The Yard Butler a local landscape designer and debited between $280890.01 and $281474 from the church organization’s Wells Fargo account.

Venmo account records showed Fisher’s Venmo account was linked to the church’s Wells Fargo account as a payment method for transactions.

Transaction descriptions further show Fisher allegedly used the money to pay for child care furniture a dog dog waste cleanup food gasoline her mortgage and supplies/labor to finish the basement of her new house.

Between July and October 2022 alone Fisher allegedly spend at least $38801.84 from the church’s Idaho Central Credit Union account.

A warrant was issued for Fisher’s arrest on May 3 and she was booked into the Bonneville County Jail on May 7. Her bail was set to $30000. She posted bond and was released on the same day.

Fisher is expected to appear for a preliminary hearing on May 29. If convicted she could face up to 42 years in prison.

Though Fisher has been charged with these crimes it does not necessarily mean she committed them. Everyone is presumed innocent until they are proven guilty."

Sin Cara (now known as Cinta de Oro) recently spoke with WrestleZone and looked back on the infamous ‘Sin Cara vs. Sin Cara’ feud in WWE. The feud itself was not without its problems but the backstory was even more interesting considering how much history the two men actually shared.

Sin Cara II started in Mexico as Mistico in 1999 but he was forced to change his name to “Incognito” due to a legal issue with CMLL who won the rights to the Mistico name. Mistico II was then played by Luis Alvirde who would ultimately debut in WWE as the original Sin Cara. In July 2011 Sin Cara (Alvirde) was suspended by WWE for a violation of the company’s Wellness Policy which opened the door for Cinta de Oro wearing the Sin Cara mask.

Cinta de Oro says WWE didn’t plan a feud between the two Sin Caras and explained how he first pitched the idea to Triple H.

“When I got to WWE I was there in FCW for like a year and then they hired him as this new star from Mexico and they made this press conference in Mexico and all the lights with him and he was gonna be the next Rey Mysterio or whatever. So during that time I had a meeting with Hunter in FCW where I told him the story about the Misticos. It wasn’t something that came into their mind like ‘oh we’re gonna do this story’ or that they invented that story. No it was I told them what had happened in Mexico so when he got suspended” Cinta de Oro said “They got the idea of bringing me in as the imposter and actually continuing like the real-life story from Mexico and making it into a feud over here in WWE.

“So that’s why when he got suspended I got the call and they told me ‘hey we want you to come up’ but they didn’t tell me exactly what they wanted me to do until the story like—I was there for a month and when he got back from suspension that’s when they told me that they wanted to do a feud with me and him. But I think the feud culminated very soon it wasn’t for me it was to build him up” he said. “That’s why we ended it off in Mexico City and on SmackDown television.

He says he knew the feud was designed to build the original Sin Cara up but he’d heard backstage talk that they took the mask off of the wrong wrestler.

“I’m not gonna say names but there was a couple of meetings during that day where one of the agents told them that they were making the wrong decision about taking the mask off me. He said they were taking the mask off the wrong wrestler the one who should be losing the mask is the other guy. I’m not gonna say names out of respect but he was the one that actually told me that and I’m very grateful because he believed in me all that time that I was in WWE. He’s a legend also he’s a legend in the business and he told me that he was sorry and said ‘I fought for you they don’t wanna listen and that’s it.’

Cinta de Oro ultimately left the name and mask behind but spent some time on the shelf due to an ACL injury. He was back for about three weeks before he got the call that WWE wanted him to take over the Sin Cara gimmick full-time after the original performer was released and he explained how it was a wild twist to the story that had started with ‘Mistico’ in Mexico.

“I get a call at home on a Thursday from the office asking me if I wanted to take over Sin Cara and I was in shock I couldn’t believe it. I was like ‘what are you talking about? Yeah!’ They were done with this guy they didn’t want him anymore and asked if I was willing to take over the character and I was like ‘let’s do it!’ Because of everything that had happened in Mexico and the names and now it was going to be the opposite way something that was taken away from me God has given me divine justice in a sense. So it was pretty crazy man it was pretty crazy how everything came about but I wouldn’t change anything to be honest” he said. “Everything in my life has built the person that I am and to be able to talk to people and appreciate what I have now you know? If everything would have been like roses you wouldn’t be able to appreciate anything and I appreciate what I have my kids my friends everybody that’s around me that I love and I think that has taught me a lot.”

Jika jawabanmu berputar pada “No Surprise” ”High and Dry” “Fake Plastic Trees” atau bahkan tak tahu yang lain lagi kamu mungkin perlu mengenal band asal Abingdon Oxfordshire Britania Raya ini lebih dekat. Mari mulai dengan resensi—atau boleh dibilang catatan apresiasi musik level rendah yang hanya berdasarkan suka-tidak suka—album The Bends yang dirilis 26 tahun lalu.

Kisah ini dimulai pada tahun 1985 ketika lima remaja tanggung Inggris memutuskan membentuk band. Beranggotakan Thom Yorke sebagai vokal utama sekaligus pendiri dengan persona yang murung dan sering melakukan gestur aneh saat bernyanyi. Jonny Greenwood pada gitar utama yang pada awal kemunculannya adalah bocah emo pemalu dengan catatan pernah menghancurkan gitarnya sendiri di atas panggung. Ed O’Brien sebagai gitaris yang suka memanggil namanya sendiri saat pertunjukan. Colin Greenwood pada gitar bas yang tak suka menghadap ke penonton ketika pentas. Terakhir ada Phil Selway sebagai drumer yang terlihat tak begitu mencintai pekerjaanya. Komposisi sempurna gerombolan pemuda yang secara alami ‘tidak bahagia’.

Debut single mereka berjudul “Creep” yang dirilis pada 1992 awalnya tak diterima baik bahkan BBC Radio One Inggris mem-blacklist lagu ini karena dianggap terlalu depresif. Namun pada tahun berikutnya lagu ini tiba-tiba meledak di Tel Aviv Israel–untuk pertama kalinya Radiohead melakukan konser di luar Inggris. Secara ajaib music video (MV) “Creep” populer di Amerika dan menjadi hit di MTv hingga langsung naik pada urutan kedua di tangga lagu modern Amerika. Selang setahun band yang awalnya bernama On a Friday ini merilis album bertajuk Pablo Honey. Alih-alih disambut dengan baik album ini justru banjir kritik dan dianggap gagal. Kritikus musik kala itu mencibir—band dengan ‘rock lemah’. Setelah itu band ini menghilang seandainya Radiohead benar-benar menyerah mereka akan dikenang sebagai band medioker dengan hanya satu hit yang dikenal—atau bahkan dilupakan sama sekali.

Lahir Kembali

The Bends adalah diskografi yang rilis pada 13 Maret 1995 di Inggris oleh Parlophone dan di Amerika Serikat oleh Capitol Records selang tiga tahun pasca album pertama. Meskipun banyak pendapat mengatakan The Bends bukanlah album ‘ultimate’ dari band rock alternatif ini tetapi bisa dikatakan sebagai penanda awal keberanian York dkk keluar dari gaya musik rock pasaran kala itu. Album yang diproduseri John Leckie yang juga memproduseri Pink Floyd ini seperti menjadi titik Radiohead menemukan jati diri warna musiknya yang nyentrik menembus standar alternatif rock kala itu. Berisi 12 trek dengan nuansa musik eksperimental yang kaya terbukti dari penggunaan keyboard synthesizer dan pedalboard serta aplikasi format tiga gitar yang banyak dijumpai pada tiap treknya. Tak hanya itu Thom Yorke juga menyuntikkan lirik absurd yang multitafsir diramu dengan melodi bernuansa kelam menghasilkan sensasi kemurungan dan frustrasi yang kental.

Penggarapan album ini mempertemukan Radiohead dengan seorang artworker bernama Stanley Donwood dan sound engineer bernama Godrich yang kemudian dipercaya menjadi penggarap tetap album-album Radiohead setelahnya. Mulanya sampul album diniatkan oleh Donwood dan Yorke bergambar paru-paru besi yang direkam langsung dari rumah sakit tetapi menurut Donwood ide tersebut tak menarik. Akhirnya mereka memakai potongan rekaman manekin CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation). Berdasarkan pemaknaan Donwood ekspresi wajah manekin itu seperti Android yang pertama kali merasakan ekstase sekaligus kesakitan. Sementara itu Godrich menyumbang penggarapan satu lagu saja yaitu “Black Star”. Lagu tersebut bahkan direkam tanpa kehadiran John Leckie. Karena kesamaan frekuensi Godrich akhirnya dipercaya menjadi juru ramu album Radiohead selanjutnya.

Lahir di tengah kondisi sosial-politik yang berpenyakit The Bends adalah suara penderita yang membingkai setiap virus sebagai cerita yang dapat diputar ulang. Album ini juga seperti sebuah introspeksi atas kegagalan Pablo Honey sekaligus curhatan atas rasa lelah dan putus asa generasi yang gelisah. Seperti yang dikatakan Thom Yorke kepada NME “Saya sakit parah dan secara fisik saya benar-benar kacau dan secara mental saya sudah cukup.” Populernya britpop dan rock retro-necrophiliac di pertengahan tahun 90-an memberi peluang album ini didengar oleh lebih banyak telinga. Kualitas itu semua meraih berbagai prestasi seperti; nomor 4 di UK Albums Chart dan nomor 88 di Billboard 200 AS platinum tiga kali di Inggris dan Kanada serta status platinum di Amerika Serikat dan Eropa. Tentu saja belum bisa dikatakan mengungguli kesuksesan “Creep” secara komersial.

Menyelami Rasa Lelah dan Putus Asa

“Planet Telex” adalah sebuah seruan putus asa dan “nrimo ing pandum”. Dibuka dengan suara pointilis macam sirine dari kejauhan disertai gema lalu drum bertempo sedang menyusul bersama gitar dan keyboard dengan frekuensi yang begitu bertekstur. Masuk pada lirik ritme secara keseluruhan harmonis dengan solo gitar minimalis–menonjolkan vokal Thom Yorke dan riff agresif John Greenwood. Yorke coba menjelaskan bahwa seberapa keras pun kamu mencoba merenungi dan mengubah dunia ‘rusak’ ini hanya akan berakhir sia-sia. Terima saja apa adanya barangkali Tuhan memang sengaja mendesain dunia seperti itu–tak sempurna.

Track kedua berjudul sama dengan nama albumnya “The Bends” adalah sebuah kemarahan yang bercampur rasa lelah pada dunia. Gitar yang sejak awal bermain gahar bersambut senandung vokalis memuncak pada bagian setelah reff kedua. Where do we go from here?//The planet is a gunboat in a sea of fear adalah cuplikan lirik yang menggambarkan betapa mengerikannya dunia dengan segala kepentingan egois orang-orang ‘penting’ serta perasaan menyiksa atas usaha untuk diterima sebagai orang ‘normal’ di tengah dunia yang seperti neraka.

Di urutan ketiga ada “High and Dry”’ ditulis jauh sebelum produksi album The Bends menjadi lagu tertua di album ini. Lagu dibuka dengan intro minimalis berisi gitar akustik dan drum. Jonny Greenwood pernah menertawakan lagu ini dengan kalimat “single yang benar-benar mengerikan tetapi dengan cara yang bagus. Salah satu lagu yang diharapkan akan dimainkan orang segera setelah mereka belajar gitar atau semacamnya.” Namun jauh menyelam ke dalam lirik lagu ini menegaskan bahwa pengakuan status sosial yang dikejar mati-matian adalah semu dan akan memperbudakmu.

“Fake Plastic Trees” di urutan kedua single album masih bernuansa musik serupa dengan lagu sebelumnya irit instrumen. Musik iringan berjalan stabil dan ringan hingga memasuki kalimat terakhir. Pada bait ke enam gitar memuncak intensi kembali menurun di bait terakhir dengan perpaduan synthesizer dan gitar akustik. Lagu ini terinspirasi dari pembangunan komersial yang dilakukan oleh Canary Wharf. Gambaran kehidupan yang dilahap oleh ego industri modern yang palsu dan sampah terperangkap dalam sistem melelahkan yang tidak natural.

Lagu “Bones” direkam sesaat sebelum lagu R.E.M. “What’s the Frequency Kenneth?” rilis. Lagu ini memanfaatkan pedalboard secara maksimal di bagian reff hingga sejak awal dipenuhi distorsi gitar lalu klimaks dengan menyusupkan tremolo. Sebuah guncangan setelah dibuat dua lagu akustik sebelumnya. Lagu ini seperti penggambaran perlawanan yang tampak menyedihkan seperti pada gangguan mental dan obsesi berlebih yang menggerogoti kewarasan ibarat tulang-tulang rapuh yang mengalami osteoporosis.

Jangan terkecoh dengan nuansa musik dan lirik yang terlihat ceria dan positif di awal “(Nice Dream) ” menawarkan sesuatu yang pilu dengan tanda kurung pada judul menyiratkan mimpi indah yang tak pernah jadi nyata. Psych-rock yang dramatis dalam lagu ini berujung agresif di bagian sebelum coda. Yorke membawa kita pada impian indahnya yang manis hangat penuh cinta kehidupan yang tenang dan kestabilan personal yang penuh. Bagian mengirisnya semua itu adalah apa yang tak dimilikinya ketika ia terbangun. Sepertinya “murung” adalah nama tengah laki-laki berusia 52 tahun tersebut.

“Just” adalah lagu dengan komposisi pop punk-bass gitar temper-tantrum yang memotong di tengah seperti seekor monster laba-laba muncul dari balik gedung pencakar langit saat kota tengah mengadakan festival. Struktur ritme yang terus berubah dari alt-rock menjadi akustik blues yang manis lalu screamer psikedelik yang marah menghakimi dan menciptakan pengalaman mengagumkan. Dibuat atas tantangan Thom terhadap Jonny untuk memasukkan akor sebanyak mungkin ke dalam satu lagu “Just” telah menjadi main-main yang mengasyikan. One day I’ll get to you//And teach you how to get to purest hell//You do it to yourself you do//And that’s what really hurts adalah penggalan lirik yang menegaskan depresi bisa datang tanpa permisi pada siapapun dan kita mungkin adalah korban manipulasi diri kita sendiri. Akhirnya kita sendirilah yang memasukkan paksa diri kita ke lubang depresi yang kita galih sendiri. Ini terdengar seperti pepatah lama “Musuh terdekat kita adalah diri kita sendiri.” Apakah sudah mulai merasakan gejala self-loathing?

Single utama berjudul “My Iron Lung” yang menempati urutan ke-9 ini adalah briliannya The Bends. Pertama kali dirilis sebagai EP pada tahun 1994–harmoni format tiga gitar teraplikasi ciamik di lagu ini. Diawali dengan lead gitar Jonny Greenwood ambience dari gitar ed O’Brien dan Yorke pada gitar rhythm yang disusul dengan suara bas serta drum memuncak pada setiap reff yang diakhiri dengan liar. Hal ini memunculkan sensasi naik roller coaster yang berujung anjlok dari rel–memuaskan. And if you’re frightened//You can be frightened//You can be it’s okay potongan lirik ini menguatkan setelah pengakuan kegagalan dalam hidup pada lirik sebelumnya. Mengingatkan bahwa tak masalah menjadi pecundang dan orang buangan toh hidup hanya menunda kekalahan.

“Bulletproof… I Wish I Was” adalah kudapan yang pas setelah pada lagu sebelumnya yang melahap ritme dan membakar Radiohead yang agresif. Menawarkan kelembutan strumming akor dari gitar akustik lead manis dan ketukan drum super santai bertumbuk sempurna dengan vokal Thom Yorke yang dibuat halus sutera. Produser John Leckie menempatkan gitaris Jonny dan Ed O’Brien di ruang berbeda untuk menciptakan frekuensi atmosfer tanpa mendengar lagunya saat rekaman. Coba dengar dan pejamkan matamu maka lagu ini akan membawamu mengambang di ruang angkasa hingga merasa semua berjalan lebih lambat untuk tiga menit dua puluh delapan detik. Sementara untuk saat ini lirik dalam lagu terasa kepalang absurd untuk saya pahami.

Fade In menyembulkan intro indah “Black Star” yang merupakan lagu Radiohead pertama yang diproduseri oleh Nigel Godrich. Barangkali terlihat menjadi satu-satunya lagu bertema romansa yang personal dalam album ini. Namun Thom Yorke yang murung itu tentu tak hendak mengisahkan fase kupu-kupu terbang di perutnya–ini adalah tentang melankolia yang sensitif. Menonjolkan part bas dengan riff yang putus asa–memuncak di akhir sebagai bentuk permohonan atas keadaan yang tak tertolong. Of a troubled mind//I try to understand//What is eating you adalah penggambaran yang menyakitkan bagaimana depresi menikam sebuah hubungan dan membuat sekarat kedua pihak. Hanya sebuah belas kasih yang tersisa untuk mempertahankannya.

“Sulk” adalah lagu yang terinspirasi dari peristiwa penembakan oleh seorang pria di Hungerford Inggris pada tahun 1987 yang telah membunuh 17 orang. Ritme yang sangat bertekstur membuka lagu ini dengan klimaks di akhir. Meski sempat digadang sebagai single utama rilis rekaman menyatakan lagu ini menjadi yang paling tidak disukai oleh para anggota band. Meski tidak akan ditemui kata ‘menembak’ atau ‘membantai’ Thom Yorke cukup menunjukkan kesinisannya melalui lirik When the loving comes and we’ve already gone//Just like your dad you’ll never change.

Konklusi sempurna untuk sebuah perjalanan penuh rasa sakit kebingungan dan putus asa: “Street Spirit (Fade Out)”. Dibuka dengan arpeggio yang berputar sepanjang lagu berpadu akor-akor minor yang suram lagu ini memperlihatkan sisi Thom Yorke yang lebih dewasa. Problem eksistensial yang terangkum dalam 11 trek sebelumnya bertabrakan dengan kenyataan bahwa kita akan lenyap suatu hari. Hal ini memaksa kita pada perenungan paling tidak nyaman–absurditas dunia. Mempertanyakan hal paling dasar dalam hidup kita sekaligus menjadi yang paling sering dihidari tentu saja karena itu mengancam ‘keakuan’ kita secara brutal. Persis di dua baris terakhir Thom Yorke memberi petuah menghangatkan yaitu: Immerse your soul in love//Immerse your soul in love. Dalam hidup tanpa arti yang sering menjadikan beberapa dari kita pesakitan menyedihkan ini hal paling masuk akal untuk memberi arti adalah cinta. Lagu ini seperti memberi sensasi perasaan kosong tetapi penuh di saat yang bersamaan–menarik.

Jujur Saja!

Berdasarkan impresi awal pada album ini diramal bakal berisi catatan seorang pemuda misantropis yang depresi hingga membenci dirinya sendiri tetapi rupanya amat keliru. Thom Yorke ternyata jauh lebih berbakat dan mengagumkan dari yang saya kira. Penulisan lirik yang cenderung absurd adalah tanda bahwa Yorke memiliki tingkat sensitivitas yang tinggi sehingga ia tak jatuh pada penulisan lirik yang vulgar dan gampang ditafsirkan. Gejolak pergumulan mental terutama bersinggungan dengan kepekaan terhadap isu sosial-politik yang dialami Thom Yorke tak menjadikan album ini dangkal dan ‘jualan cinta’ belaka.

Semangat kemuakan dan kemarahan atas dunia yang penuh kepalsuan sistem yang sakit keterasingan dan keputusasaan yang tak terungkap membuat album ini jadi refleksi akurat jiwa-jiwa manusia modern yang frustasi. Lebih dari itu jamuan album ini adalah rekam jejak perjalanan batin pria bernama asli Thomas Edward Yorke yang menyakitkan proses pencarian jati diri yang rawan jatuh pada lubang depresi. Ini adalah pendewasaan dalam 12 track!

Hampir mustahil menemukan keceriaan dalam album ini keresahan terlalu deras mengalir dalam tempurung kepala Thom Yorke. Ia bersama empat kawan satu kuintetnya yang secara alami tidak bahagia mengajak kita memandang dunia dengan lebih realistis. Dengan pola pikir positif yang tidak dibuat-buat–menghadapi dunia apa adanya. Mengakui bahwa kita takut lemah bodoh dan akan lenyap di suatu hari adalah jalan yang memaksa kita menemui hal paling menyebalkan—kenyataan. Akui saja bahwa dunia ini absurd hidup tidak berarti dan kita adalah makhluk paling tidak berguna di planet ini. Apakah ini menyinggung? Ya rasakan saja kegamangan itu.

The Bends adalah teman yang baik mengingatkanmu bahwa dalam menghadapi kenyataan dunia yang absurd kamu tidak sendiri. Ia menyentuh bagian paling personal menyadarkanmu pada kenyataan sekaligus menepuk pundakmu sambil berkata “tidak apa-apa”. Mungkin kita tak dapat mengubah dunia meskipun kita berusaha sampai mati tak menemukan makna hidup pasti walau sudah berpikir sampai sinting—atau setelah kematian kita hanyalah onggokan bangkai yang membusuk pada 30 hari pertama. Namun seperti pesan pada lagu terakhir setelah kenyataan yang sama sekali tidak memuaskan itu kita masih punya hal yang berarti: cinta. Ya maka tenggelamkan dirimu dalam cinta.

Tri Rahayu

Lopez is the first USA representative on the sevens circuit officiating squad since Emily Hsieh in 2019 and Mike O'Brien in 2018. He joins 18 other referees from 17 different nations in a larger squad intended to give more referees the opportunity to develop in lead up to the 2022 Rugby World Cup Sevens in South Africa. Lopez is one of USA Rugby’s standout figures in refereeing having been a regular fixture at both sevens tournaments across the country and in the World Rugby Sevens Challenger Series which saw him taking charge of matches in Chile and Uruguay in February 2020.

USA Rugby referee manager and Sr. Director of Training & Education Jamie McGregor said “Congratulations to Cisco for all the hard work he’s put in over the years to reach this level we wish him the best in excelling on the world stage as representative of USA Rugby Referees. Acknowledgement is also due to USA Rugby Sevens Referee Manager Nick Ricono and his team of referee coaches who have done an excellent job developing sevens referees over the past few years. We hope for more good news regarding opportunities for our referees to perform at these international levels in the future.”

Lopez has been selected for both the Vancouver and Edmonton legs of the HSBC World Rugby Sevens Series both scheduled to be held in September this year.

On July 15 Kat Roche earned the spotlight within Major League Rugby taking the pitch as the first ever female lead referee in an MLR match. In a season finale between the Houston Sa berCats and Seattle Seawolves Roche was front and center following Assistant Referee duties in MLR since 2019.

The first of many to come. Congrats Kat! 👏👏👏 https://t.co/2h7PM4SARH — USA Rugby (@USARugby) July 16 2021

Roche noted through the MLR press release “I’m thrilled for the opportunity to pick up the whistle in the MLR. I’ve been involved with the MLR since the first season as a volunteer in the technical zone then as an Assistant Referee and next into the Extended Referee Group. This new opportunity is my dream come true. I’ve put in a lot of work on and off the field and I’m honored that the Match Official Managers have faith in me and put me on this match.”

McGregor added “Sending along a sincere congratulations to Kat on behalf of USA Rugby. Watching her and the ranks of other excelling referees develop through the professional game is exciting to see.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vY2lzY28tbGVhZGVyc2hpcC10b3Atc2FsYXJpZXMtaG93LW11Y2gtY2lzY28tcGF5cy1leGVjcy12cHMtZGlyZWN0b3JzLTIwMjHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cisco Top Salaries: How Much Cisco Pays Execs VPs Directors,"Cisco is paying top-dollar to for senior roles including execs VPs and directors.

Salesforce needed 14 years as a public company to reach a market cap of $100 billion. Getting there required three multibillion-dollar acquisitions and four distinct revenue sources. When Zoom topped the $100 billion mark last year it had been public for just over 14 months. The company was reliant on a single product and had completed just one tiny acquisition. While it's still just a toddler on the Nasdaq Zoom is now being forced to take on adult responsibilities for investors thanks to its unexpectedly rapid ascent. The video chat company's historic growth during the Covid-19 pandemic vaulted its market cap from $9.2 billion at the time of its 2019 IPO to a peak of $159 billion in October putting it tentatively even with Cisco . Zoom has lost about one-third of its value since then despite reporting 191% revenue growth in the latest quarter as investors prepare for a post-pandemic future and as competition picks up most notably from Microsoft Teams. Still Zoom is among the 25-most valuable North American tech companies and the only one in that pack to go public in the last four years. Shopify and Snap which went public in 2015 and 2017 respectively are the only companies in the group that trade for a richer multiple to sales.

In other words the stock market is giving Zoom the tools to become a major dealmaker. And Zoom is taking advantage announcing earlier this week the $14.7 billion purchase of Five9  which sells cloud-based software to call centers. ""It allows them to use their currency to buy things that are impactful"" said Alfred Chuang a partner at venture firm Race Capital who previously co-founded BEA Systems and sold it to Oracle for $8.5 billion in 2008. ""I can't imagine this will be last one."" The Five9 deal is one of the 10 largest U.S. enterprise software transactions on record according to FactSet and is bigger than any acquisition ever by Amazon  Google  Oracle  Cisco or Adobe . At about 23 times Five9's expected 2022 revenue it's also the second-priciest software deal on a price-to-sales basis behind only Salesforce's $27 billion purchase of Slack which closed earlier this month.

Chuang who has been friends with Zoom CEO Eric Yuan since his pre-Zoom days at WebEx says Yuan is now in a position familiar to Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff whose company has more than doubled in value since mid-2018 to $240 billion. Both companies are set up to be cloud consolidators as automation changes the future of work and the enterprise software stack of the future gets built Chuang said. In the three years since reaching a $100 billion market cap Salesforce has completed four billion-dollar-plus deals including Slack and the $15.7 billion purchase of Tableau. ""Not everything has worked out"" Chuang said but he argues it's important to take take big swings even if the business is currently in good shape. ""When you have a very fast-growing company and become very successful most people don't want to rock the boat"" he said. ""Acquisitions are not only useful to acquire customers but are super critical to satisfy a product vision you may have.""

The Cisco connection

Zoom's initial talks with Five9 date back to last year according to people familiar with the matter. The CEOs who both previously worked on collaboration products at Cisco know each other well and forged a product integration in 2019 when Zoom launched a phone offering. Yuan was a lead engineer at WebEx when the company was acquired by Cisco in 2007 and Five9 CEO Rowan Trollope ran all of Cisco's collaboration products including WebEx until taking the Five9 job in 2018. They never overlapped at Cisco — Yuan left to start Zoom a year before Trollope joined — but the connection is key as they both saw the challenges of retrofitting a legacy technology company for the cloud era. Acquisition talks cooled for a while and picked up in the last three months said people with knowledge of the transaction who asked not to be named because the discussions were confidential. That's when Goldman Sachs started advising Zoom on a deal and Five9 hired Frank Quattrone's Qatalyst Partners. Zoom also shuffled internal responsibilities this year putting CFO Kelly Steckelberg in charge of business development a job that had previously been held by operating chief Aparna Bawa people close to the matter said. Yuan and Steckelberg drove the Five9 deal the people said. Bawa has assumed increased responsibilities elsewhere in the business. She oversees security privacy and government relations which all took center stage as Zoom became a widely-used service at large enterprises as well as in education health care and among religious organizations.

Representatives from Zoom and Five9 declined to comment. At a Morgan Stanley investor event in March Steckelberg was asked about Zoom's plans for the call center. ""Contact center is an absolutely really important part of the phone strategy"" Steckelberg said in response. ""The way we approach that today is through partnering. We have great relationships with Five9. Eric and Rowan are very good friends."" Zoom's goal is to be not only a video service used for meetings with co-workers and clients but to become the center of all work communication including for customer service reps in call centers. Yuan went a step further in June on Zoom's quarterly earnings call. He responded to an analyst's question about contact center expansion by telling investors ""Stay tuned you will see something."" He followed by suggesting that details could be revealed around the time of the company's Zoomtopia conference in September. ""I hope we will be able to do more"" he said indicating that Zoom may go beyond integrations with call center technology providers.

Buy vs. build

A big reason why an agreement took so long to come together was because both stocks were so volatile people familiar with the talks said. Shares of Zoom and Five9 moved 10% or more in a single week on several occasions this year making it difficult to come to terms. Ultimately the acquisition price was a modest 13% premium to Five9's last closing price before the announcement. The deal is projected to close in the first half of 2022 and Trollope will continue to run Five9 as a president of Zoom. Five9 adds a projected $650 million in revenue next year to the $4.8 billion in sales that analysts expect from Zoom according to StreetAccount. On the investor call following the announcement Yuan and Trollope said that common customers have been telling them they want to count on a single vendor that can provide communications technology for internal purposes as well as customer service. Zoom could invest in building the product itself but customers ""do not want to wait"" Yuan said. Analysts like BTIG's Matt VanVliet said the decision to buy instead of build is the right one. ""Overall we are encouraged by Zoom's strategy to supercharge its platform with this acquisition rather than rely purely on its own internal R&D chops which would have taken years to scale"" wrote VanVliet who has a buy recommendation on Zoom in a report on July 19. Zoom has a long way to go before it can claim to have a portfolio of cloud software products like Salesforce Adobe and ServiceNow . Late last year the company entered the live events space with the launch of a homegrown product called OnZoom expanding the video platform beyond the workplace and betting that online gatherings in some form are here to stay. In July Zoom hired Abhisht Arora a 21-year Microsoft veteran and Teams program manager as its head of corporate strategy reporting directly to Yuan. Between development of new products and big acquisitions into parallel markets Yuan is trying to ensure that Zoom is more than just a pandemic stock and that its status as an enterprise giant remains long after we say goodbye to Covid-19. — CNBC's Alex Sherman contributed to this report.

Believers Church of Statesboro and the Statesboro-Bulloch Chamber of Commerce held back to school parties Saturday morning July 24. These two groups made a huge difference in helping Bulloch students get ready for school.

15th annual Believers Church Back to School Party

Fifteen years ago Believers Church of Statesboro's leadership were made of a large number of students who were not returning to school the first week of school. After talking with Bulloch Schools they determined that many of the students would not return because they did not have the needed school supplies. Instead of fearing embarrassment they sat out the first week.

That year the number was around 500 students. Believers set a goal to purchase new book bags fill them with party supplies and create a carnival type event at the church to distribute them. They distributed all 500 that year.

From that beginning this has become a signature event for Believers Church in our community. With other organizations now collecting and distribution school supplies they have seen the need diminish somewhat.

Saturday morning members of Believers Church were up early setting up an amazing morning of fun to make the children feel special and loved. In addition to getting them much needed supplies to ensure a successful start to school. The back to school party was held at the church at 6495 Harville Road.

Statesboro-Bulloch Chamber Health Committee Back to School Party Downtown

Also Saturday morning the Statesboro-Bulloch Chamber Health Industry Committee held a back to school block party at the former location of the chamber at 102 South Main and in the Ag South parking lot next door.

This was also a free event for the public to showcase a “Vaccine Clinic” to vaccinate the youths before school. The Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson vaccines were available to those 12 years and up.

They reported vaccinating over 40 at the event this morning. That may sound like a low number but similar pop up vaccination clinics have struggled to vaccinate 5 or 10 people.

There was free school supplies food games ponies music and giveaways.

Statesboro New Covenant Church provided children’s activities and information about upcoming youth conferences and services.

Missed Out on a Backpack?

If you or someone you know is in need of a backpack with school supplies please call the Statesboro Family YMCA at (912) 225-1962.

The Statesboro Family YMCA is excited to support young learners in Bulloch County with a new backpack full of supplies to ready them for the upcoming school year.

Want to Donate Schools Supplies?

For the eighth consecutive year Prevent Child Abuse Bulloch County (PCABC) and United Way of Southeast Georgia (UWSG) are partnering for their annual Back to School Supply Drive happening both online and in-person until the 26th.

School supplies will be collected from through July 26th. Donated school supplies can be placed in the designated boxes (the flyer that is on these boxes is below) at the following locations in Statesboro: Morris Bank Core Credit Union Synovous Bank Queensborough National Bank Renasant Bank Citizens Bank Bulloch First Colony Bank and The Heritage Bank. Churches and civic/professional organizations will also be working with their members to collect school supplies.

All school supplies are given directly to each public elementary middle and high school in Bulloch County so that school personnel can discreetly distribute the supplies to the identified children.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlYWRpbmdlYWdsZS5jb20vMjAyMS8wNy8yNS9uZXdzbWFrZXJzLWZvci1qdWx5LTI1L9IBQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlYWRpbmdlYWdsZS5jb20vMjAyMS8wNy8yNS9uZXdzbWFrZXJzLWZvci1qdWx5LTI1L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Newsmakers for July 25,"RKL

Johnny Cueto really had the green light manager Gabe Kapler explained Saturday afternoon a day after his dynamic eccentric starter swiped the first base by a Giants hurler in 18 seasons.

For a long time Cueto said he’s told his coaches I’m going to steal if I get the green light.

And on a 2-2 pitch to Lamonte Wade in the third inning of Friday’s 6-4 loss to the Pirates there it was. Pittsburgh starter Chad Kuhl was taking his time to home plate and first baseman John Nogowski was playing off the bag. Cueto who worked a walk to reach first base took an aggressive lead and made it four steps before leaving his helmet in the dust behind him.

“I read his feet” Cueto said Friday night through an interpreter. “I figured as soon as he lifts his hands and puts them to his chest I was going to take off. And that’s exactly what I did.”

Cueto chugged into second base standing up — with a grin about 90 feet long on his face.

Johnny Cueto: SPEED DEMON 🏃😂 pic.twitter.com/VPWS8EtuDh — SF Giants on NBCS (@NBCSGiants) July 24 2021

“I love that he’s such a showman” Kapler said before Saturday’s game. “He’s got a flair for the dramatic and a style that is unique and all his own. I think that style is an important part of this team. We need some emotion and Johnny brings that to us.”

And Kapler added “his sprint speed is real.”

For any number of reasons — injury risk athleticism a simple lack of opportunities to name a few — it’s rare to see a pitcher utilize his legs on the basepaths. No Giants pitcher had stolen a base since Kirk Rueter singled and swiped second against Arizona on Aug. 29 2003.

Cueto suffers from no lack of athleticism. He’s been fielding ground balls at second base in pregame warmups and Kapler said Cueto could outrun a handful of Giants position players.

Kapler said he’d like give more pitchers the green light to run but often concern over injury outweighs the potential of picking up an additional 90 feet.

“There are a lot of times when a first baseman isn’t holding a pitcher on where we want to run and the only thing that holds us back is injury” Kapler said. “How badly would we like to have this pitcher on second base? Is it worth him slipping and falling? Something weird happening? In Johnny’s case I think he’s really prepared to run so I wasn’t as worried.”

As for the rest of the Giants’ pitching staff? Well maybe it won’t be another 18 years. But don’t count on another green light anytime soon.

Cueto will be biding his time.

“If they give me the green light” he said “I’ll go ahead and take it.”"
CLX,Clorox,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhbG9uLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA3LzI0L2EtY3VyaW91cy11bmlvbi1jbG9yb3gtY2xldmVsYW5kLWNsaW5pYy1hbmQtdGhlLWNkYy1mb3VuZGF0aW9uX3BhcnRuZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A curious union: Clorox Cleveland Clinic and the CDC Foundation,"As a second wave of Covid-19 infections tore through the United States in the summer of 2020 a partnership was forged between the Cleveland Clinic one of the nation's premiere medical centers and the Clorox Company the California-based ­­­­­­­maker of surface disinfectants. Sales of Clorox products had been soaring since the beginning of the pandemic when public health agencies were still warning that SARS-CoV-2 the virus that causes Covid-19 could lurk on surfaces sickening people who touched them. The company's stock was also soaring and at times it struggled to keep up with demand.

Under the partnership the company and the clinic would co-produce public health guidelines to help the public navigate the Covid-19 pandemic. The arrangement continued into March of this year when the CDC Foundation — an independent nonprofit chartered by Congress to support the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — joined the group. Their ongoing campaign the Clorox Safer Today Alliance includes ads for the brand that bear the Cleveland Clinic and CDC Foundation logos. The Alliance advises companies — including United Airlines and AMC Theatres — and individuals on navigating Covid-19 reopening with an emphasis on disinfecting surfaces.

This seemingly benevolent union in the name of public health has a problem critics say: a lack of compelling evidence that surface disinfection plays any significant role in halting the spread of Covid-19. Despite early speculation among experts that surface contact was a key mode of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and subsequent rush among consumers to purchase cleaning products at the outset of the pandemic the science supporting frequent surface disinfection as a response to Covid-19 has largely faltered many experts say.

Indeed after nearly 18 months of investigation most scientists believe that airborne transmission is the chief concern and that overuse of surface disinfectants may well do more harm than good. ""Your efforts at cleaning are better spent towards cleaning the air than cleaning the surfaces"" said Linsey Marr a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Virginia Tech and a prominent expert on Covid-19 transmission.

Given this the continued relationship between two major public health organizations and the Clorox Company — which appears well positioned to profit from a particular interpretation of the science — has some critics raising pointed questions about the appropriateness of the arrangement and the misleading messages it might send to consumers. It also comes amid ongoing scrutiny by experts and advocates of the effects of corporate donations on scientific research and public health. Clorox donated $1 million to the Cleveland Clinic this spring and a press release for the Safer Today Alliance notes that the company also donated $1 million to the CDC Foundation in early 2020.

Some of the Alliance's messaging does refer to broader goals and a Clorox representative emphasized that the campaign seeks to target transmissible diseases and related public health protections well beyond the current pandemic. But Covid-19 remains front-and-center in much of the Alliance's promotional material and in Clorox's own video spots heralding the partnership — which prominently feature both CDC Foundation and Cleveland Clinic branding — workers wiping misting and otherwise treating surfaces with disinfectants have the starring role.

Emanuel Goldman a microbiologist at Rutgers University and vocal skeptic of disinfection as a Covid-19 deterrent described the arrangement as ""crass commercialism.""

Representatives of the Cleveland Clinic declined to make anyone available for an interview with Undark and a prepared statement issued by the nonprofit hospital system did not directly address questions about the science behind disinfection and surface transmission of SARS-CoV-2. In an email message Clorox spokesperson Molly Steinkrauss said that while transmission of Covid-19 via surfaces is ""a low risk it's not zero"" and the use of disinfectants ""is a part of a holistic strategy of prevention methods that we continue to emphasize particularly for public spaces where contamination of surfaces is more unknown."" She added that disinfection can also help fight pathogens like influenza and norovirus.

But Goldman who remains skeptical suggested that the arrangement with Clorox is building on an erroneous precedent set early in the pandemic.

""They are playing"" he said ""upon people's fears.""

* * *

During the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other health agencies suggested that the virus was probably spreading via surfaces a process known as fomite transmission. Companies and governments invested millions in electrostatic sprayers and extensive cleaning protocols. In one viral video from March 2020 a Michigan physician showed viewers how to disinfect their groceries with Lysol.

Not all experts were convinced. In July Goldman published a commentary in The Lancet arguing that fomite transmission ""has been assumed on the basis of studies that have little resemblance to real-life scenarios"" and that the risk of catching the virus from contact with surfaces was ""very small."" Later that month a widely read essay in The Atlantic described the push to sanitize surfaces as ""hygiene theater"" – a performance that made people feel safer but that seemed to have little support from infectious disease research.

At the same time some researchers began to express concern that all those powerful cleaners could be having unintended health effects — potentially driving the emergence of antimicrobial-resistant super-pathogens or producing toxic fumes in households. A CDC report published in April 2020 noted a sharp rise in calls to poison control centers about exposure to disinfectants coinciding with the stay-at-home orders issued early in the pandemic.

""People just think the pandemic's the most dangerous thing in our lives so anything else should come in second or third place"" said Li Li an environmental modeler in the School of Public Health at the University of Nevada Reno. But Li said his own research suggests that heavy daily use of full-strength disinfectants in the home could also pose risks — findings that have led him to change his own disinfection practices.

Today many experts say scientific opinion has largely shifted away from emphasizing surface transmission. ""Where things stand now is that I think there's a consensus — there are still some holdouts vocal holdouts — but there's a consensus that the virus spreads mainly through the air by breathing it in in very small respiratory droplets that we call aerosols"" said Marr.

These sorts of assessments appear to have had little bearing on the Clorox and Cleveland Clinic guidelines. In March alongside the announcement of Clorox's $1 million donation to the Cleveland Clinic the two organizations and the CDC Foundation formally launched the Safer Today Alliance. A commercial promoting the Alliance largely depicts people spraying down surfaces as do photos in public safety guidelines released later that month. (The guidelines still co-produced by Cleveland Clinic and Clorox do not mention the CDC Foundation.)

In Clorox's own video spots heralding the partnership — which prominently feature both CDC Foundation and Cleveland Clinic branding — workers wiping misting and otherwise treating surfaces with disinfectants have the starring role.

Soon after the CDC began issuing recommendations that would seem to conflict with the messaging of the partnership. Indeed just weeks after the Alliance launched the agency de-emphasized disinfection in its official recommendations to the public and it stopped recommending that people routinely disinfect surfaces in their homes. (It continued to recommend some disinfection in public spaces.) During a briefing that month CDC scientist Vincent Hill suggested that disinfection was giving people ""a false sense of security"" and possibly exposing people to toxic chemicals. ""In most situations cleaning surfaces using soap or detergent and not disinfecting is enough to reduce the already low risk of virus transmission through surfaces"" Hill said according to CNN

Clorox has continued to promote the campaign. Guidance on both the Clorox and Cleveland Clinic websites stresses disinfection. And while CDC guidelines note that surface transmission of SARS-CoV-2 appears to be very rare the Clorox-backed documents do not have such caveats.

Cleveland Clinic declined to make anyone available for an interview with Undark. In a statement provided by spokesperson Victoria Vinci the nonprofit said it was focused on helping businesses as they slowly renew in-office activities: ""Cleveland Clinic offers guidance that will help businesses working with the Alliance limit the risk of Covid-19 help protect their employees and customers and sustain a healthier work environment as they reopen.""

Still the campaign's emphasis on surface disinfection continues to confuse some experts. ""The evidence for airborne spread is very strong indeed"" wrote Trish Greenhalgh a physician-researcher at Oxford University who has published extensively on SARS-CoV-2 transmission in an email to Undark. The evidence for droplet transmission via surfaces ""is exceptionally weak"" she added. ""Disinfection plays little or no role in controlling the spread of an airborne disease obviously.""

Some experts also say that surfaces can be cleaned effectively with less toxic chemicals. ""Even if you're worried about surfaces all you need is soap and water"" said Goldman. ""Or a little alcohol. That kills the virus. You do not need Clorox; you do not need bleach; you do not need disinfectant. The virus is fragile. It dies easily and quickly.""

After reviewing more details of the Safer Today Alliance campaign Goldman followed up in an email. ""This is outrageous given what we have learned in the past year"" he wrote. ""The Cleveland Clinic knows better.""

* * *

The Safer Today Alliance was born at a time when many experts and advocates were already expressing concern over the impact of corporate largesse on scientific research and public health. In the past several years some of that attention has fallen on the CDC Foundation. Authorized by Congress in 1992 the foundation raises money for CDC programs and although separate from the public health agency the organizations maintain close ties. Public donor reports show that pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies donate to the group.

In 2019 a petition from several watchdog groups argued that the CDC Foundation essentially allows companies to give money to the CDC potentially compromising the cash-strapped agency's independence. ""It's a way for companies to reach through and to influence the agency itself"" said Gary Ruskin executive director and co-founder of U.S Right to Know one of the groups behind the petition. (The group is principally funded by the Organic Consumers Association an advocacy organization for the organic agriculture industry that has long battled government regulatory agencies over the use of genetically modified organisms on U.S. farms.)

Ruskin said an arrangement like the Safer Today Alliance — in which the CDC Foundation logo appears in marketing materials for a company — was new to him.

""This sort of thing makes it look like CDC is for sale like for a little cash they're going to endorse cleaning products or other commercial stuff"" Ruskin said. ""It cheapens our Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to make it look like a pitchman for cleaning wipes.""

The CDC Foundation declined to make anyone available for an interview but in detailed written responses to Undark communications director Amy Tolchinsky said the decision to join the Safer Today Alliance was ""independent of a donation."" Regarding the 2020 gift from Clorox Tolchinsky wrote that ""when the Foundation receives an offer of a donation during an emergency response we review the donor and the donation to ensure that neither present a conflict of interest for the CDC Foundation."" The CDC Foundation she added has ""no role or involvement"" in setting CDC guidance.

The $1 million donated to the Cleveland Clinic will support the launch of the Clorox Public Health Research Fund. The fund will prioritize Covid-19 research Cleveland Clinic wrote in its statement to Undark and ""will inform the development of tomorrow's virus-fighting cleaners and other health and safety products along with practices and protocols.""

In their comments to Undark all three organizations characterized the partnership as a useful way to share public health guidance during a crisis. And Quinn Grundy an assistant professor with the University of Toronto's Faculty of Nursing who studies corporate influence on science and health care said the arrangement might seem like a win-win: ""Clorox wants to sell disinfecting things and there's germs out in the world and we're in the middle of a germy pandemic and probably disinfecting's good and this might help us communicate with a lot of people.""

But the interests of those three organizations Grundy added may not always be aligned — something that becomes clearer as the scientific evidence shifts.

""In light of this alliance in light of this money I think it calls into question whether the Cleveland Clinic or the CDC can actually fulfill its mission"" she said ""which would be to communicate health information to the public based on the best available evidence there is at the time.""

“The first bottle of Coca-Cola from 1894 contained around 3.5 grams of cocaine” the Facebook post shared by 3000 people reads. “Explains why our parents & grandparents could walk to & from school uphill both ways in the snow barefoot.”

The person who posted the meme did not respond to USA TODAY’s request for comment.

Early Coca-Cola contained cocaine

Coca-Cola did in fact once contain cocaine according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. When the popular drink was invented it was first marketed as a “patent medicine”; cocaine was legal at the time and was a common ingredient in medicines according to the institute.

The cocaine in the drink – and later its removal – presented a ""delicate public relations problem"" for the company in its early years according to the book ""For God Country and Coca-Cola.""

“If the company responded to attacks by telling the truth they would be admitting that the drink did once have cocaine in it"" author Mark Pendergrast wrote in “For God Country and Coca-Cola."" ""The implication would be that they had removed it because it was harmful which might even open the door to lawsuits. Besides it was unthinkable to admit that Coca-Cola had ever been anything but pure and wholesome.”

According to the book John Candler grandson of Coca-Cola founder Asa G. Candler attempted to rewrite history by denying the drink ever had cocaine in it.

Company spokesmen told The New York Times in 1988 that the original recipe brewed in 1886 included cocaine but the drug was eliminated from the recipe just after the turn of the century.

In response to USA TODAY's request for comment Ann Moore a spokesperson for Coca-Cola said the drink ""does not contain cocaine or any other harmful substance and cocaine has never been an added ingredient in Coca-Cola.""

The cocaine in the drink was more specifically ecgonine a precursor to cocaine according to Snopes. It was derived from extract from the coca plant.

Although coca leaves are illegal in the United States the company still uses them to make their famous drink after they’ve been “de-cocainized” by Stepan Chemical Co. in Maywood New Jersey according to Scientific American.

Cocaine formerly in drink likely much less than 3.5 grams

While there’s no way to know for sure exactly how much cocaine was once in the popular soda it’s unlikely the amount reached 3.5 grams.

According to Snopes which examined the claim in 1999 there was just 1/400 of a grain of cocaine per ounce of syrup by 1902 and the drink was cocaine-free by 1929 when the de-cocainization process was perfected.

Our rating: Missing context

We rate the claim that the first bottle of Coca-Cola contained 3.5 grams of cocaine as MISSING CONTEXT because without additional information it could be misleading. While Coca-Cola did once contain some cocaine it’s very unlikely the drink contained that much.

The new recipe—which optimizes existing Coca‑Cola Zero Sugar flavors and existing ingredients—starts hitting shelves this month in the United States with full nationwide distribution in the U.S. and Canada starting in August with full distribution in September. All listed ingredients and nutritional information remain the same.

A simplified packaging design is anchored by the iconic Coca‑Cola logo and red cues with black Spencerian script signaling the Zero Sugar variety and “Now More Delicious” messaging highlighting the new formula in the U.S.. All Coca‑Cola Zero Sugar packaging—including 7.5-oz. and 12-oz. cans fridge packs and 13.2-oz. 16.9-oz. 20-oz. 1.25-liter and 2-liter bottles—will feature the streamlined graphics as well as in Coca‑Cola Zero Sugar packaging in Canada – including 222 mL & 355 mL cans and 250mL 300mL 500mL 710 mL 1L and 2L bottles.

To celebrate and debut the launch of the new Coca‑Cola Zero Sugar the brand will show up at “Manhattanhenge” on July 13 at 7:30 p.m. as New Yorkers gear up to check out the spectacular sunset.

“Manhattanhenge” occurs this year from July 12-13 in New York City when the sunset perfectly aligns with east-west-oriented streets framing the sun between skyscrapers as it dips below the horizon. The event draws thousands of New Yorkers and tourists annually.

Onlookers at key intersections on July 12th were handed a “first sip” of the product before the official launch and billboards throughout the city — will spread the Coca‑Cola Zero Sugar news. And the excitement isn’t limited to the Big Apple; fans across the country can download special Coke Zero Sugar Snapchat Lenses to take sunset selfies at home.

An integrated marketing and sampling campaign will invite consumers to try the product and find out if it’s the “Best Coke Ever?” Creative will break next month across outdoor retail streaming audio/local radio online video digital and social media channels. Additional content in the fall will leverage the brand’s longstanding ties with professional and collegiate football teams.

The reformulation which is currently on shelves across Europe and Latin America supports The Coca‑Cola Company’s strategy to offer a broad portfolio of beverages that fit a variety of tastes and lifestyles—and moving quickly and experimenting in an intelligent and disciplined manner.

Coca‑Cola Zero Sugar which launched in 2005 was reformulated in 2017 to bring its taste even closer to Coca‑Cola. Since then the brand has consistently delivered double-digit growth.

While I love all kinds of coffee — hot iced frozen you name it — some days it’s simply not enough to really get my day going.

While I can’t say I’m opposed to multiple coffees a day there’s now a new drink that will give you an extra buzz without having to make a second cup of java: Coca-Cola with Coffee!

Officially in stores nationwide Coca-Cola with Coffee has the taste of classic Coca-Cola that’s infused with a rich coffee flavor. It packs 69 milligrams of caffeine into a 12-ounce can which is less than what you can expect from an 8-ounce cup of coffee but more than double the 34 milligrams of caffeine in a can of regular Coca-Cola.

Two flavors of the new cola Dark Blend and Vanilla are available in individual 12-ounce cans and 4-packs while the Caramel flavor is only offered in individual cans. You can also find a sugar-free option in Dark Blend and Vanilla.

If this blend sounds familiar you might have seen it on sale during an overseas vacation. Similar products from the soda giant have already been available in international markets for some time including in Australia Italy Spain Thailand Poland and Japan where it’s called Coca-Cola Coffee Plus.

That popular option wasn’t the first time Coca-Cola has ventured into the coffee world. Some may remember Coca-Cola BlÄK which was discontinued in 2008 after just two years. (Thanks to the internet though you can make a version of it yourself.)

If you’d still rather make it yourself anyway Coca-Cola has a coffee granita recipe that sounds pretty similar to the new product though this one is frozen. All you need is brewed coffee sugar Coca-Cola and a vanilla bean.

If you’re looking for a canned beverage that is more like regular coffee there are many others that you can keep chilled right in your fridge.

Starbucks has a cold brew concentrate along with their classic bottled Frappuccinos in mocha vanilla and caramel. Dunkin’ also sells bottled iced coffees and they even now have Caramel Macchiato- and Mocha Latte-flavored cereals that contain caffeine if you want to skip an entire step by just eating your morning cup of coffee.

Dunkin'

Other brands of coffee you can take on-the-go include KoiaCoffee which is Keto-friendly and has the added benefit of protein. There is also High Brew canned coffee which is sold in grocery stores nationwide and has dozens of flavors some with added protein. They even have a triple shot espresso that has three times the caffeine of a regular cup of coffee.

Grady’s has entire cold brew kits that make 36 cups of cold brew coffee so you can really stay stocked up. All you do is add water to the bags and it stores right in your fridge with a spout for easy access. You can find some of their products at stores like Target and Whole Foods or order online from Walmart or Amazon.

The Worcester Red Sox rattled off four quick runs early in Game 1 of Saturday's doubleheader but it was mostly all Lehigh Valley from there.

The WooSox were swept by the Iron Pigs 10-7 in the opener and 6-4 in the nightcap at Coca-Cola Park in Allentown Pennsylvania giving Lehigh Valley a 4-2 edge in wins entering Sunday's final game of the series.

Worcester (37-32) was held to six hits in the second game by Lehigh Valley (31-40) after collecting 11 in the opener.

Teams come out slugging in Game 1

The teams combined for 22 hits over 6½ innings in the opener but only two runs after the top of the fourth.

With one out in the first inning of Game 1 Josh Ockimey skied a three-run homer off IronPigs starter Julian Garcia's hanging curveball far over the wall in right field for a 3-0 WooSox lead. It was Ockimey's 11th home run of the season scoring Jonathan Arauz (single) and Chris Herrmann (walk).

Worcester hiked the count to 4-0 in the second when Arauz's one-out infield single drove in Yairo Muñoz who turned on the wheels from second to score after stealing his 12th base of the season.

Lehigh Valley however turned it around in its half of the inning. Charlie Tilson's lined single to left off WooSox starter Raynel Espinal (7-3) drove in one run then leadoff hitter Daniel Brito followed with a three-run homer for a 5-4 IronPigs lead.

Just minutes after Worcester re-tied the game in the third Mickey Moniak and Matt Vierling homered back-to-back to start the bottom half off Espinal.

Tilson delivered an RBI double still with none out to give the WooSox an 8-5 deficit. Espinal was lifted with one out in the inning after allowing eight runs on seven hits his ERA rising from 3.35 to 4.31.

The WooSox got two of those back whenTate Matheny's double to left in the fourth drove in Herrmann (another walk) Michael Gettys (single) for an 8-7 score.

Lehigh added insurance in the sixth on Moniak's second homer of the night with a man on.

Fast start for Lehigh Valley in Game 2

The IronPigs kept slugging to start the nightcap with the first four batters hitting safely off John Schreiber and five out the first six bringing home five runs on six hits in the first inning.

Arauz's two-run homer in the fourth gave the WooSox some life but the IronPigs hiked their lead by a run on a Downs throwing error from shortstop.

Worcester chipped away with single runs in the fifth and sixth innings Muñoz 's single delivering newcomer Grant Williams in the fifth and Jett Bandy doubling in Gettys in the sixth.

Marcus Walden hurled three innings off fine relief for Worcester allowing just three hits and one unearned run.

Streak goes on for Muñoz

Yairo Muñoz went 4 for 9 in the doubleheader and still has hit safely in every WooSox game in July. His streak is now 18 games entering the final game of this series.

In Saturday's nightcap he singled in the fourth inning and scored on Arauz's sixth home run of the season. Muñoz later drove in Worcester's third run in the fifth.

On his third at-bat of the opener and a productive one at that Muñoz collected his only hit of the game a ground single to the left side to drive in Matheny who had walked for the second time tying the game 5-5 in the third.

With two out in the seventh and final inning of the nightcap Munoz doubled to center bringing up the tying run in Arauz who flied to center field to end it.

Muñoz finished the first game 1 for 5 and the second 3 for 4. He's 30 for 69 during the streak (.435) with four three-hit games and four two-hit games. He's now batting .304.

Time for a Game 7 on Sunday

For the first time this season the WooSox have had a series go to a seventh game necessitated by the July 8 rainout that was made up Saturday night. Neither team has announced a starting pitcher for Sunday's 1:35 p.m. game to conclude the road series.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaGNydW5jaC5jb20vMjAyMS8wNy8yNS9kYXRhLWRyaXZlbi1pdGVyYXRpb24taGVscGVkLWNoaW5hcy1nZW5raS1mb3Jlc3QtYmVjb21lLWEtNmItYmV2ZXJhZ2UtZ2lhbnQtaW4tNS15ZWFycy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Data-driven iteration helped China’s Genki Forest become a $6B beverage giant in 5 years,"China’s e-commerce and industrial ecosystem is as different from the Western world as its culture. The country took decades to earn its reputation as the Factory of the World but it now boasts a supply chain and manufacturing ability that few countries can match.

Creative use of the country’s networked manufacturing and logistics hubs make mass production both cheap and easy. Clothing electronics toys automobiles musical instruments furniture — you name it and you’ll find a manufacturer in China who can turn your intangible concept into mass-manufacturable reality in mere days. And they’ll do it for cheaper than anywhere else in the world.

China is also home to one of the world’s largest e-commerce and tech ecosystems. Hundreds of startups dot the landscape and the amount of money being raised and spent on innovating around the country’s industrial heft is mind-boggling.

So it was just a matter of time until an intrepid Chinese entrepreneur with a tech background decided to take on Coca-Cola and PepsiCo. The tech revolution hasn’t yet affected the bottled beverage industry quite as much as it has others. Incumbent giants therefore could lose a sizable chunk of market share if a company could just manage to weave together China’s manufacturing proficiency and agility with the modern tech startup philosophy of “moving fast and breaking stuff.”

Genki Forest a Chinese direct-to-consumer (D2C) bottled beverage startup is one such contender. A philosophy centered around iteration informed by data quick turnarounds and a laser focus on taking advantage of China’s huge e-commerce ecosystem has helped this company’s revenues rise rapidly since it started five years ago. Its sugar-free sodas milk teas and energy drinks sell in 40 countries and generated revenue of about $450 million in 2020. The company aims to reach $1.2 billion this year.

If anything Genki Forest’s valuation has shot up even faster. It recently completed its fourth VC round that values it at a whopping $6 billion triple the price it fetched a year earlier and it has so far raised at least half a billion dollars.

It’s striking how closely Genki Forest’s operations resemble that of a tech startup. So we thought we should take a closer look and see what this company’s graph can tell us about the new wave of Chinese D2C entrepreneurship looking to take over the globe.

Finding a bigger wave to ride

The bottled beverage industry wasn’t what Genki Forest’s founder Binsen Tang initially set out to tackle. His first startup was a successful casual mostly mobile gaming outfit known as ELEX Technology. It was nowhere near record-breaking though — some 50 million users logged on to a few popular games in over 40 countries worldwide including one of the first versions of Happy Farm a predecessor to Zynga’s Farmville. But Tang wasn’t satisfied and eventually sold ELEX Technology to a publicly listed company for about $400 million in 2014.

Tang would walk away with a few important lessons. He’d learned by now that Chinese products were already competitive globally whether people realized it or not and that and geographic arbitrage was real Happy Farm being the perfect example of this. Lastly he now knew that it was far more important to choose the right “racetrack” (as Chinese investors and entrepreneurs like to put it) than to have a great product.

Picking the right race to win was perhaps the most important takeaway. It’s also an idea that sets Chinese entrepreneurs apart from their Western counterparts — the most worthwhile endeavors are in identifying the largest and most rewarding market at hand regardless of one’s previous expertise. It was what led Zhang Yiming to create ByteDance and Lei Jun to found Xiaomi.

That very philosophy led Tang to build Genki Forest. After selling ELEX Technology Tang didn’t go back to the business that netted him his first pot of gold. As much as he had benefited from the rise of the mobile internet he thought there was a far bigger opportunity building a consumer brand and applying the lessons he learned from programming to the manufacture of tangible products.

He soon set up his own investment fund Challenjers Capital convinced that the next big tech opportunity in China was in tech’s application to everyday consumer products. He soon began to invest in everything from ramen and hotpots to bottled beverages.

China’s quickly expanding e-commerce ecosystem and the plethora of D2C businesses flourishing on Alibaba and JD.com would also influence his decision to sell directly to his target audience rather than take the traditional route. But to truly understand his motivations we need to take a look at the extremely unique D2C environment in China and how it has changed over the years.

What’s different about Chinese D2C?

“China doesn’t need any more good platforms” Tang told his team in an internal email in 2015 “but it does need good products.” Tang was talking about how the age of building infrastructure for e-commerce in China was largely over; it was now time to create brands that could take advantage of the advanced distribution network that had been laid out.

Other investors noticed as well. Albus Yu principal at China Growth Capital told me that his fund had stopped making investments in independent consumer-facing platforms or marketplaces for a while. “2014 might have been the last year it was economically feasible to start such a business due to the soaring cost of acquiring customers and the strength of incumbents” he said.

Indeed 2015 was the year when CACs began to exceed or at least rival ARPUs for Alibaba and JD.com.

In China that distribution network was present across the digital and physical worlds. Online there was immense market power concentrated in the hands of just two players: Alibaba and JD.com which used to have and still maintain 80% or above in market share.

In fact the dominance of Alibaba in particular was so overwhelming that for years VCs invested not in D2C but in “Taobao brands” since that was the only channel one needed to conquer in order to make it.

Customer acquisition was therefore straightforward — throw everything into advertising on Alibaba’s Tmall platform especially during its annual flagship shopping festival Singles’ Day. Even today garnering a top spot in one of the category leaderboards remains a surefire way to build brand awareness investor interest as well as sales records.

Physically the Chinese market also differs greatly from much of the developed West. Years of heavy investment in logistics by the private sector accelerated by government support and infrastructure buildout means that delivery costs have come down significantly over the years even dipping below $0.40 per package wholesale as of this year. Innovations such as return insurance have also sped up customer adoption.

By 2016 China was shipping 30 billion packages a year already accounting for 44% of global shipments. That number has been doubling every three years and is expected to exceed 100 billion this year. And the low cost of delivery is one of the biggest reasons for China’s outsized e-commerce market — the largest globally and estimated to reach $2.8 trillion in 2021 more than triple that of the No. 2 the U.S.

Present-day China also presents another edge: Proximity to an advanced flexible manufacturing network and supply chain for the vast majority of consumer products and the ability to outsource almost everything to them.

The original equipment manufacturers of years past have long since evolved into original design manufacturers. An expected consequence of being “the Factory of the World” for so many years making goods for some of the best brands in the world is that some of the knowledge was bound to transfer.

It may be difficult for outsiders to understand just how strong China’s networked manufacturing hubs are these days. What used to take weeks now takes mere days the lead times shortened drastically by software robots and other advancements. For example Chinese cross-border ultra-fast-fashion company Shein has compressed design-to-ship timelines to as little as seven days.

And it’s definitely not just for making crop tops. The turnaround can be astonishingly fast even when manufacturing completely unfamiliar goods such as when electric vehicle maker BYD turned its factory into the world’s largest face mask plant in just two weeks when the COVID-19 pandemic struck last year.

Companies leverage this manufacturing flexibility and agility for more than just speed. Chinese cosmetics upstart Perfect Diary uses it to launch twice as many SKUs as foreign competitors. In addition the quick turnaround allows agile brands to take advantage of that most ephemeral of IP memes.

It’s not to say that the Chinese supply chain is inaccessible to foreign entrepreneurs. Best-selling mattress maker Zinus for example is founded by a South Korean but its products are manufactured in China and sold mostly on Amazon to U.S. customers.

It’s just that very few non-Chinese companies have figured out how to tap as deeply into the supply chain as this new crop of Chinese D2C brands which can require years of working not just alongside but physically inside the factories building trust and know-how. Shein for example watches carefully what other brands are making by staying close to the factories.

The China opportunity

Before global sensations such as TikTok weakened the mantra “copy to China” used to be a dominant characterization of Chinese startups. In December 2015 when Tang registered the Genki Forest trademark that was still very much a relevant strategy.

While Xiaomi may have been inspired by Apple and WeChat by Kik for Genki Forest inspiration would come from the East. The Japanese market was rife with sugar-free teas and other drinks and as Chinese consumers were becoming more wealthy and health conscious it was a safe bet that they too would be looking for lower sugar content in their beverages.

Genki Forest decided to first tackle the fruit tea market then carbonated drinks because the latter not only accounted for a large TAM ($14 billion) but the sector was also dominated by slow-moving foreign incumbents.

Finally much like Miniso a Chinese retailer inspired by Japan’s Muji Tang picked a Japanese sounding name look and feel in order to take advantage of the Chinese customer’s association of high quality with Japan.

However a lack of any real experience in the beverage industry meant the Genki Forest team had to spend the initial months in their laboratory cooking up everything they could think of. Eventually they launched two fruit teas that were inspired by trending drinks in Japan at the time.

The company’s big break came when Tang and Co. realized that they could use erythritol an artificial sweetener as a substitute for sugar. The sweetener was not popular in China but was used by American and European brands such as BAI.

Importantly it only has 6% of the caloric content of sugar but 70% of the sweetness and had passed extensive tests for safety all of which made it a superb choice for marketing to health-conscious consumers. The problem though is that erythritol is more expensive than sugar and much more expensive than other substitutes by as much as 70 times.

With retail prices hovering around $1 per bottle online Genki Forest is competitively priced without being cheap but that means it likely makes less money per bottle than competitors that use less expensive ingredients. When probed on this Candy Tang a Genki Forest executive explained that “it is just one way we try to live up to our mission of giving our customers good products.”

Iterate rinse repeat

Easy access to advanced digital and physical infrastructure as well as manufacturing might be important ingredients for success but it does not explain why Tang picked the bottled beverage industry. To make sense of this let’s return to the “racetrack” theory which says choosing the right market is the most important decision that an entrepreneur can make.

Tang had noticed by now that a good number of both global and Chinese top companies were in the beverage industry. It was also a sector that had yet to be remade by software. This fit nicely with a popular theory floating around in Chinese startups an application of the “dimensionality reduction attack” as envisioned by science fiction author Liu Cixin in the third volume of his trilogy the Three Body Problem.

The idea is that “higher dimensional beings” such as tech entrepreneurs harnessing the power of the internet and the scientific iterative process of software development could easily defeat the businesses of other companies who were not using this “technology superpower” to their advantage.

Tang realized that his casual game development experience which revolved around optimizing every step of the user journey from content to distribution could be applied to the beverage industry.

In keeping with its founder’s tech background Genki Forest tries to digitize and optimize every step of the process from product development and marketing to sales and distribution. The most difficult aspect of digitalization Tang says “is whether the boss can give up the power in his hands believe in the numbers and use them to make decisions instead.”

As much as possible data is collected and analyzed quickly and fast iterations are prized. This laser focus on data-driven iterative development lets Genki Forest (like others in this emerging cohort of Chinese D2C brands) remake products in a matter of days versus the year-plus process that incumbents still utilize.

And just like an internet company Genki Forest considers data one of its most powerful weapons and will pay handsomely for it either buying it from third parties or thinking of ways to procure it.

The company can easily track and experiment with the products it sells online which accounts for over 30% of its sales. It also does plenty of A/B testing and has apparently even performed some fake door testing. As a general rule products are sold online first and offline distribution is unlocked only for the best-performing products.

While Genki Forest’s percentage of online sales is indeed higher than most of its competitors the bulk or nearly 70% of the company’s revenues still come from offline channels which are notoriously difficult to break into. In fact the company told me its milk tea series could be bought solely on online stores for a while and only made it into brick-and-mortar stores because enough customers asked about it until traditional distributors noticed.

Fortuitously Genki Forest happened to be expanding alongside a boom in convenience stores in 2016 to 2018 and was able to sell to them directly. For mom-and-pop shops which make up the larger share of endpoints the company goes through distributors.

Aside from the extra costs incurred by selling offline the largest inconvenience to Genki Forest is that it can’t collect sales data in real time. To fix this the company is in the process of launching 80000 IoT smart fridges.

Besides data collection for product development Genki Forest also focused on aggressive digital marketing leveraging both existing and new e-commerce infrastructure. For 2019’s 618 Shopping Festival organized by JD the company sold over two million bottles taking first place in the beverage category. That year it beat Coca-Cola and Pepsi in the year’s largest shopping event Alibaba’s Singles Day and took the category crown in 2020.

As for newer digital platforms and formats the company began selling on China’s No. 2 e-commerce livestream in 2019 which is hosted by Austin Li. For those who are not familiar with the Chinese liveshopping boom the market is expected to reach $300 billion this year accounting for 9% of all e-commerce activity in the country.

Later that year Genki Forest also launched its own RED and Douyin accounts. RED is a lifestyle product discovery platform that is often described as China’s Instagram and Douyin is the Chinese version of TikTok. While these tactics were already well known for other consumer product categories Genki Forest was early in adopting them as a beverage company.

Finally the company fully leverages the Chinese supply chain know-how in order to launch and iterate products quickly. Like other Chinese D2C brands of recent years it has more SKUs and is growing them faster than traditional competitors. From 2018 its SKUs have grown from just 10 to 50. In comparison the 12-year-old BAI has just 31 SKUs.

Yet just judging the number of SKUs would also be misleading as the products themselves have gone through many changes. Alienergy a Genki Forest sub-brand that was launched in 2020 has already gone through more than three rounds of major packaging redesign. But this shouldn’t surprise anyone. As long as the data supports it physical changes to the product can be made quickly and cheaply as going from a beverage bottle concept drawing to a whole manufacturing line setup for mass production can take as little as six days.

It’s not all smooth sailing

Despite the many advantages the company has plenty of naysayers. Firstly there is the fact that most D2C brands begin with no manufacturing capabilities and little or no proprietary R&D leading many investors to discount them as marketing outfits with no real IP.

Public market investors have levied this complaint against another Chinese D2C company Yatsen Group maker of Perfect Diary cosmetics contributing to its 30% drop in stock price. While it’s true that Genki Forest has smartly anticipated these objections and already began manufacturing at its own facilities in late 2020 presumably it will be a while before it can own its entire supply chain.

What’s more competitors are emerging rapidly both in the form of new upstarts including one by a former employee as well as incumbents who have realized they are falling behind. Most are aiming squarely at the sugar-free soda business which Genki Forest popularized and still accounts for a reported 70% of its revenues.

Some are even using erythritol which the company brought to Asia but has no exclusive hold on. Others are attacking on the distribution side such as Nongfu which is promising free drinks for every Nongfu bottle that shopkeepers place in a Genki Forest fridge.

On the IP front Genki Forest now has a 1000-person-strong R&D team as well as a research outfit in collaboration with Jiangnan University focused on reducing sugar intake. As for distribution it is even paying cash rewards to keep its fridges clear of competing products. But all this will eat into margins and the cautious investor will likely argue that it is much too early to see if the company can maintain its lead.

Finally like any fast-growing startup Genki Forest is no stranger to the occasional PR crisis. Earlier this year the company proactively changed the label of its milk teas from the scientifically accurate but easily misunderstood “no sucrose” to the more intelligible “low sugar” in an effort to clarify its contents.

Unfortunately this announcement backfired. Not only did Genki Forest fail to appease critics who had previously accused the brand of using misleading marketing tactics it ended up causing a social media firestorm. While the company has managed to navigate this maelstrom intact with such a high profile it is likely to face similar challenges in the future.

What’s next for Made in China?

The combination of advanced digital e-commerce infrastructure cheap logistics and networked supply chain hubs are enabling a new generation of Chinese D2C brands to apply the data-driven methods of software development to the design and sales of physical goods.

At five years old Genki Forest has become the poster child for this new trend. Early VC investor Anna Fang agrees: “Everything feels right about the company — the space the founder the products and the back end … they exemplify the new Chinese consumer brand.“

Finally the “new Chinese consumer brand” is not content to only sell in China. Like Tang realized a decade ago with his gaming startup good products that work in one market can often work in others just as well.

Genki Forest is wasting no time. Its products are already sold in 40 countries both offline and on online platforms such as Amazon. It also has 70 employees on its globalization team and recently hired Zhen Liu a former Uber China exec and ex-head of international at ByteDance to lead its expansion efforts. According to Candy who oversees international M&A the team is actively looking to make acquisitions or investments abroad and may be taking some of these brands back to China.

Either way Genki Forest is a company to watch in this new wave of Chinese D2C consumer products. Only time will tell if this new spin on “Made In China” — just like “Made in Japan” decades earlier — is on the cusp of becoming something globally important."

Racing Louisville provides a disclaimer on their website that the stadium’s home-goal celebration “does contain bright flashing lights that may cause discomfort and/or seizures for those with photosensitive epilepsy.”

The organization offers sensory bags for those with noise sensitivity.

BBVA stadium also provides sensory bags to guests and has a sensory room in the Houston facility. The Houston Dynamo website states that “Dash employees participated in sensory awareness training in order to understand how best to serve fans with unique needs and concerns.”

For Bixby and others the precautions may not be adequate.

On Friday the S&P 500 index crossed the 4400-mark for the first time while the Dow Jones Industrial Average moved past 35000 and reached a new high. Meanwhile weekly jobless claims increased unexpectedly to around 419000 dampening hopes of labor market recovery.

Continuing its buyout spree Accenture bought two technology companies early this week — Toronto-based Oracle cloud service provider Cloudworks and workforce optimization consultancy Workforce Insight – and completed the previously announced acquisition of France-based cybersecurity firm Openminded.

In another tech deal Microsoft agreed to acquire security start-up CloudKnox. Meanwhile Visa clinched a deal to buy Currencycloud for about 700 million pounds.

The airline industry dominated the earnings scene this week with United Airlines reporting results on Tuesday and Southwest Airlines and American Airlines releasing their second-quarter statements on Thursday. Earlier IBM came out with positive numbers for its most recent quarter on Monday. The next day all eyes were on streaming giant Netflix which published mixed results in the after-hours.

Energy firm Kinder Morgan Seagate Technology Verizon soft drink major Coca-Cola and Johnson & Johnson stole the show on Wednesday. Thursday was as busy as usual with the major events being the second-quarter earnings releases of telecom firm AT&T fast-food chain Domino’s Pizza Biogen Abbott Laboratories Intel as well as social networking platforms Twitter and Snap. Schlumberger American Express and Kimberly-Clark reported Friday before the opening bell.

While Lockheed Martin is probably the only major company to report earnings on July 26 the market will be closely following the report of Alphabet on July 27. The Google parent will be joined by gadget giant Apple chipmaker AMD Starbucks and Microsoft in the after-hours. Before the opening bell aviation firm JetBlue and engineering behemoth General Electric are scheduled to report earnings.

The financial releases of Bristol-Myers Squibb aircraft builder Boeing and Ford Motor are the key events slated for July 28. The next day is going to be as hectic when the earnings announcements of e-commerce giant Amazon.com Altria Group Yum! Brands and Merck & Co. are on tap. Procter & Gamble oil giant ExxonMobil and Caterpillar are among the major companies preparing to report on July 30.

CMCSA,Comcast,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMitQFodHRwczovL2xhbmNhc3Rlcm9ubGluZS5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvbG9jYWxfYnVzaW5lc3Mvc2hlbnRlbC10by1jaGFsbGVuZ2UtY29tY2FzdC1pbi1zdWJ1cmJhbi1sYW5jYXN0ZXItd2l0aC1pbnRlcm5ldC1vdGhlci1zZXJ2aWNlcy9hcnRpY2xlXzBjOGYxNjY0LWVhNDQtMTFlYi05MWUwLTEzYTE4YjFkNDM2Yy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Shentel to challenge Comcast in suburban Lancaster with internet other services,"Television internet and phone service provider Comcast is getting competition in suburban Lancaster.

A Virginia-based telecom named Shentel plans to spend “tens of millions of dollars” to bring its state-of-the-art internet service plus its cable television and phone services to municipalities that ring Lancaster city as soon as 12 to 18 months from now.

“We think that this will be transformative for your community. This is the infrastructure for the 21st century” said Chris Kyle vice president of Shentel to the West Lampeter Township supervisors on July 12.

Shentel has signed franchise agreements so far with Lancaster Township East Hempfield Township and Mountville Borough the first of several procedural steps it needs to fulfill in order to start building its own infrastructure here. The company is talking to East Lampeter West Lampeter and Manheim townships and has alerted West Hempfield Township it’ll be in touch soon.

While Shentel will offer all three services what telecoms call the “triple play” its emphasis will be on its “Glo Fiber” internet service where Shentel believes its entirely fiber-optic network offers significant advantages over Comcast’s.

Shentel runs its own fiber-optic wire all the way to homes or businesses using existing utility poles and underground conduit where possible Kyle said. In contrast Comcast runs its fiber-optic wire some of the way then switches to coaxial wire for the final distance to homes or businesses he said.

That means Shentel customers enjoy upload speeds that are equal to download speeds whereas Comcast customers don’t according to Kyle. Pure fiber-optic networks are more reliable too he said because they have fewer “failure points.”

Business and institutional customers have long valued these “symmetrical” upload and download speeds Kyle said. Then with the pandemic forcing students and adults to work remotely from home that attribute suddenly became critical to residential customers too he said.

“It used to be that people used their internet at home most of the time in the evenings for downloading Netflix and other videos pulling data down. But when COVID hit your house started performing a lot more like a business location” he said to LNP | LancasterOnline.

While students are headed back to their classrooms “this (remote) workforce thing is not going away and to do that you need people who have this technology in their homes. They need to be able to push this data up not just bring data down” Kyle added.

It’s in high demand among businesses and institutions too he said making Glo Fiber a powerful economic development tool. “All the larger cities in the U.S. are clamoring for this. We know there’s a market for it a need for it -- and it’s only going to grow over time.”

Comcast acknowledged that Shentel’s internet infrastructure is constructed differently than Comcast’s but disputed the significance. Research by The Internet & Television Association showed that uploads accounted for just 6% to 7% percent of internet traffic during pandemic compared to 5% before the pandemic.

Comcast spokesman Bob Grove said the company “operates one of the world’s largest smartest fastest and most reliable fiber-based networks in the country. We compete everyday with providers that offer different technologies but customers continue to choose Comcast because we offer an unparalleled internet experience that includes gigabit speeds across our footprint the best WiFi coverage and controls in the home and a network of more than 20 million WiFi hotspots.”

East Hempfield Township Manager Cindy Schweitzer said the need for speed is real.

“Those upload and download speeds are very important to those residents who now work from home and do a lot of uploading of documents and materials” she said. “So that might grab some people. Great download speed is nice but if I want to have a home office I need upload speed as well. It makes me more productive.”

Lisa Riggs president of the Economic Development Company of Lancaster County a nonprofit that supports business growth here was encouraged by Shentel’s decision to come to the county.

“We see it as a good sign that they are entering the marketplace and offering consumers and businesses a choice with a fiber-optic product as we know this option is reliable and provides good speeds” Riggs said noting it’s a service the entire county needs.

“Looking ahead any market that doesn’t offer reliable rapid and affordable broadband is at a competitive disadvantage from both an economic development and quality of life perspective” she added.

In the neighborhood

Shentel based in Edinburg Virginia about 100 miles west of Washington D.C. is targeting Lancaster County and other southcentral Pennsylvania counties largely because it already has laid a foundation here – a fiber-optic backbone built “decades ago” to provide service for Sprint wireless (now T-Mobile).

It’s reached a franchise agreement with Carlisle Borough Cumberland County and Hanover Borough and York Township in York County. The company also is pursuing franchise agreements with other municipalities in those counties. Ten days ago Shentel was picked by York College to provide high-speed internet and phone service at its three campuses.

“We already have a significant investment up there and it just makes sense to leverage it in this way” Kyle said. Had Shentel not already built this foundation “doesn’t mean we’d never (expand in southcentral Pennsylvania) but (having the backbone in place) absolutely makes it easier.”

Comparison shopping

Consumers and businesses can expect to be the beneficiaries of an extremely competitive marketplace especially for internet service – Shentel’s primary focus.

“We believe we’re going to provide an improved internet offering at or below the standard pricing of Comcast …” Kyle told the East Hempfield Township supervisors at their May 5 meeting.

But that will trigger “more aggressive competitive tactics from (Comcast)” he predicted. “They’re going to compete very hard for the consumers in your market. And at the end of the day who wins when businesses compete? Your citizens are going to win.”

Judging from the prices that Shentel and Comcast list for comparable but not identical products if purchased by themselves Shentel has an edge in top-speed internet. Comcast has a price advantage with cable TV. (See chart for details.)

But Comcast offers more tiers within a given product category such as six levels of internet service including an option for low-income customers compared to Shentel’s three.

The different volumes of products are the result of different philosophies. “We’re trying to keep it simple” Kyle explained. Comcast offers many tiers of service in an effort to match consumers’ varying needs.

Comcast also offers related categories such as home security. Both Shentel and Comcast offer discounts when buying more than one product.

As the product lineups vary so do the sizes of the two publicly held telecoms.

Consider Comcast. Besides having the largest home internet business and largest cable TV business in the country Comcast also owns NBCUniversal and DreamWorks Animation. With first quarter revenue of $27 billion it has more than 150000 miles of fiber optic line and 168000 employees.

Shentel in contrast is a publicly held regional company that posted first quarter revenue of $60 million; as a point of reference that exceeded Lancaster-based Burnham Holdings’ first quarter revenue ($44 million). Shentel has 7000 miles of fiber optic line and 1050 employees.

Though it’s a fraction of Comcast’s size Shentel is plenty big enough strong enough and experienced enough to handle the expansion in Lancaster County Kyle emphasized. The 118-year-old firm has been building purely fiber-optic networks for years he pointed out.

Actually being a smaller firm has its advantages Kyle told the East Hempfield supervisors: “We’re not too large so there’s no bureaucracy where you don’t know who to get in touch with” he said.

Role reversal

Comcast’s situation as the incumbent in central Lancaster County is the opposite of the position it took in northern Lancaster County two years ago.

There it’s the challenger beginning to construct its own infrastructure in 2019 in West Earl Warwick and Ephrata townships and Lititz Akron and Ephrata boroughs a region where Blue Ridge has operated for decades. Comcast’s build-out is “essentially complete” in Lititz Warwick West Earl and Akron. Ephrata township and borough will be done by year-end.

Welcome addition

The six municipal managers where Shentel has reached or is seeking a franchise agreement unanimously embraced the opportunity to give their residents and businesses another choice of internet cable TV and phone providers.

“I would imagine that the residents would welcome another option to consider and would appreciate some competition. It’s like which grocery store do you want to go to? Some people like Weis some people like Giant some people like Wegmans. It’s a personal decision” said Dee Dee McGuire West Lampeter manager voicing a view shared by her counterparts.

“There are those that are very happy with Comcast and there are those that may want an alternative to that service” said Jim Drumm Manheim Township manager. “This would give them that.”

Kyle was reluctant to say which other of the county’s 60 municipalities Shentel will approach in the coming months in hopes of bringing them its “future-proof” technology except to say that Lancaster city is among them.

Lancaster city has the highest population (about 59000) and population density (about 8200 people per square mile) in the county. “From a business point of view it just makes sense. We want to load up our network (with customers)” he said.

As for the remainder Shentel is analyzing them for population density and the willingness of municipal leadership to support Shentel’s arrival. Those are the cheapest to serve shortening the time it would take for Shentel to recoup its investment in infrastructure and turn a profit.

Though Kyle declined to estimate how much Shentel will spend to develop its own network here other than say “tens of millions of dollars” he did say that Shentel will invest $700 to $1200 per every home its network goes past.

“It gets more difficult for us where (population) density falls off drastically. Right now we’re concentrating our fire. We’ll hit the dense areas and then spiderweb out” he explained.

Kyle also declined to estimate how many permanent jobs it will create here saying that figure will depend on the number of customers it draws. But permanent positions will include jobs in sales customer service and operations.

Reaching a franchise agreement is just one of the hurdles that Shentel has to clear before it can begin building its infrastructure in a given municipality. The company also has to perform an engineering study to figure out how it will be built – a precursor for obtaining a building permit from the municipality.

Kyle acknowledged that building the infrastructure would be “disruptive but not overly disruptive” as he told West Lampeter supervisors.

Homes and businesses are most likely be served by following the way the structures get electricity – via utility poles or underground. The latter option would use conduit if it’s already in place and has space or Shentel would bore or trench to the home or business he said then restoring it to its original condition.

“That’s something we’re going to look at closely” said Drumm Manheim Township’s manager. “I wouldn’t expect it to be terribly disruptive. But it could close a street for an afternoon as they’re working and putting in lines.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3N3ZWVrLmNvbS9jaGluYS1zbGFtcy1uYmMtb2x5bXBpY3MtY292ZXJhZ2UtbWlzc2luZy10YWl3YW4tc291dGgtY2hpbmEtc2VhLW1hcC0xNjEyNzU40gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,China Slams NBC Olympics Coverage For Missing Taiwan S.

The building at this time known as Cathedral Square Phase 1 will rise 245 feet and 23 stories tall. The tower is designed by Solomon Cornwell Buenz which had also designed the Murano condominium and The Laurel Rittenhouse which is currently under construction. The two-tower complex is being developed by the Archdiocese of Philadelphia and Exeter Property Group which will span much of the city block that is situated three blocks to the north of the Comcast Center.

In the previous update on the project the building had reached a milestone as it was just beginning to rise above ground after the completion of its single basement level. The first poured concrete floor has been constructed with the ground floor slab topping the foundation. The beams for the first floor above ground were poured and the concrete forms were starting to rise on the south side of the site. The tower’s construction was in full swing now that the crane was in place.

The structure has grown more since the last update as the building now stands three stories above ground. Workers are now seen all around the site. During YIMBY’s site visit several concrete trucks were lined up on the south side of the site as concrete pours were inn progress. The tower crane can be seen from many blocks away including from Arch Street just to the west of the Benjamin Franklin Parkway. With the pace of the construction it appears that the tower may be topped out by the end of the year.

Completion of the structure is anticipated by 2024.

Reuters-Yonhap



NBC's TV broadcast of the Tokyo Olympic Games opening ceremony drew 16.7 million viewers the smallest TV audience for the event in the past 33 years according to preliminary data provided by Comcast-owned NBCUniversal on Saturday.



Across all platforms including NBCOlympics.com and the NBC Sports app 17 million people watched the ceremony the company said in an email.



The streaming audience on those platforms grew 76 percent from the 2018 PyeongChang opening ceremony and 72 percent from the 2016 Rio opener reflecting a change in viewing habits.



Friday's audience reflects a steep drop despite difficult comparisons with previous opening ceremonies when viewers had fewer options for streaming content.



The Tokyo opener TV audience declined 37 percent from 2016 when 26.5 million people watched the Rio de Janeiro Games opener and 59 percent from 2012 when 40.7 million people watched the London ceremony.

""The map is an expression of the national territory symbolizing national sovereignty and territorial integrity” a spokesperson for the Chinese Consulate in New York said in a statement. ""We urge the NBC to recognize the serious nature of this problem and take measures to correct the error.”

The statement did not specify how the Chinese government viewed the map as incomplete.

Multinationals operating in China have previously found themselves apologizing for the usage of maps that sometimes don’t include Taiwan Tibet or disputed islands in the South China Sea.

""Attempts to use the Olympic Games to play political ‘tricks’ and self-promotion to achieve ulterior motives will never succeed” according to the statement.

On Friday during the parade of athletes at the Games' opening ceremony an announcer for Japanese public broadcaster NHK also raised eyebrows by referring to the Taiwanese team as ""Taiwan"" rather than ""Chinese Taipei"" the name used in some international organizations and competitions for the self-ruled island.

China views Taiwan as an inherent part of its territory and sees it as a renegade province that must be brought back into the fold — by force if necessary.

Ties between China and the U.S. have been strained over a series of issues including Hong Kong human rights in Xinjiang and renewed probes into the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic. Beijing on Friday said it’s sanctioning seven people and entities including former U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in retaliation for a Biden administration warning to businesses about working in Hong Kong."

Photo Credit Bobby Cochran

Newly nominated for Emerging Act of the Year at the 2021 Americana Music Awards Charley Crockett has become one of the leading lights in independent country music following a decade of busking on the streets of New York City and New Orleans and only two years removed from life-saving open-heart surgery. The South Texas native crafts his self-proclaimed “Gulf & Western” sound by synthesizing country blues soul cajun Western Swing R&B and other pieces of American roots music into an unmatched truly singular sound. When Crockett’s voice comes out of your speakers there is no confusing him for any other artist. Rolling Stone raves Crockett is “Gearing up for a breakout year” and NPR Music calls him “such a fascinating mix very 21st century and very vintage.” The Wall Street Journal agrees “Mr. Crockett’s unique vocal style is one third Ernest Tubb honky tonk with clipped-word diction one third Bill Withers low-key soulful crooning and one third jazzy French Quarter second-line swagger.”

Hailing from the Texas bordertown of San Benito Crockett was raised in an isolated rural part of the Rio Grande Valley by a single mother in a trailer surrounded by sugar cane and grapefruit fields. As a teenager he was into free-styling and rapping. He spent formative years living with his uncle in New Orleans where he first became a street performer who discovered a love for folk music. In New York City he played hip hop and blues on street corners and in subway cars. What’s important to his identity as an artist says Crockett is that he has lived the songs he writes and sings. The prolific artist surprise released 10 For Slim: Charley Crockett Sings James Hand a tribute to his friend and Texas honky tonk hero James Hand in February and just announced Music City USA another full-length album of new songs out in September. We’re excited to welcome Charley Crockett and his band the Blue Drifters to the ACL stage.",,,,,,,,,,,,

NEW ROCHELLE New York (WABC) -- Cleanup continued Saturday following an oil spill in Westchester County that leaked into a nearby harbor.

A Con Edison spokesman says dielectric fluid leaked from a transmission feeder into a manhole on Nautilus Place on Saturday July 17.

Some of the fluid then entered a nearby catch basin on Drake Avenue and then leaked into the waters of New Rochelle Harbor.

Kristin Thorne has more on the New Yorkers who are making the move to Florida.

Members of the U.S. Coast Guard responded to the scene along with the New York City Fire Department and Con Edison.

The spokesman says Con Edison clamped the feeder stopping the leak and immediately began working to contain and remove the fluid.

Video showed crews still working to clean up the spill this weekend.

Con Edison says they are using protective booming absorbent materials and oil skimming equipment to contain and recover the fluid in the harbor.

The dielectric fluid that leaked into the water is a non-hazardous fluid consisting of mineral oil.

It's used to keep transmission cables cool to carry power reliably.

Charged with Attempted Murder,"Dobbs Ferry Police at the scene of slashing of Sgt. in May

Identity of Police Officer Still Unknown

A Dobbs Ferry man was indicted by a Westchester County Grand Jury for the attempted murder of a police officer after stabbing the officer in the head with a knife Westchester District Attorney Miriam E. Rocah announced. Matthew Burke stabbed the uniformed police officer in his head as he was directing traffic at a construction site in the area of 200 Beacon Hill Drive during an unprovoked incident on May 20 2021. The defendant was apprehended within a few minutes by members of the Dobbs Ferry Police Department with assistance of utility and construction workers who witnessed the violent attack.

Burke was indicted on the following counts:

· Attempted Murder in the First Degree

· Attempted Murder in the Second Degree

· Aggravated Assault Upon a Police Officer

· Assault in the First Degree (two counts)

· Criminal Possession of a Weapon in the Third Degree

“This aggressive attack of a police officer is shocking and shows the danger these public servants face in the line of duty” DA Rocah said. “We are committed to ensuring justice for this officer and holding the attacker accountable for his actions.”

Prior to the indictment Burke was examined to see if he had the mental capacity to be charged with the crimes now filed against him. The identity of the police officer remains a mystery and many residents in Greenburgh and the surrrounding communities wish to offer him and his family support and best wishes. After being slashed the officer told a Con Edison worker “if I bleed out make sure my wife and kids know that I love them’”

The 44-year-old sergeant has been with the department since 2008 and was promoted to sergeant in March. There has also been no motive or reason for the attack provided to the public.",,,,,,,,,

Durango SRT Hellcats Are Become More Rare By The Moment:,"The new supercharged 2021 Dodge Durango SRT Hellcat was one of the highest-anticipated vehicles for the Dodge brand in recent years. The Durango SRT Hellcat is limited to a 1-year production run (due to government regulations on the vehicle’s current architecture) instantly making the performance SUV a future collectible.

The 2021 Dodge Durango SRT Hellcat currently holds the title as the most powerful SUV ever delivering 710 horsepower and 645 lb.-ft. of torque from the proven supercharged 6.2-liter HEMI® Hellcat V8 engine.

With an original production run of just 2000 units Dodge//SRT expanded the production due to demand adding an additional 1000 units to the mix. With numbers making it rarer than the drag racing-oriented 2018 Dodge Challenger SRT Demon the Durango is drawing huge upcharges.

Those upcharges continue to grow as a number of the Durango SRT Hellcat continue to be destroyed at an alarming rate. In May we saw two of the limited edition models stolen from a Stellantis holding lot in Toledo Ohio leaving one damaged after hitting a fire hydrant. Several of the 710 horsepower SUVs have also shown up on the popular online auction site Copart.

The latest victim has one 2583 miles on the odometer. While it looks like the Hellcat powertrain remains mostly untouched there is a lot of damage to the driver’s side and front of the vehicle. Currently located in Philadephia we pulled the window sticker to see what actual options are on the vehicle…

Ethiopian Pioneer Hi-Bred Seeds Inc. has been hit with management crisis following disputes that emerged since last month between local management and regional office The Reporter has learnt.

According to sources that approached The Reporter the dispute arose after top officials from the company’s African regional bureau set up and sent a team of investigators to investigate the top management of the local office who have allegedly been involved in misconduct.

Sources from Corteva Ethiopia who spoke to The Reporter on condition of anonymity stated that investigators arrived in Addis Ababa two weeks ago to establish facts on whether the Country Leader Feseha Zeru has committed an alleged misconduct that relates to abuse of power along with undisclosed aides in his management team.

Following the arrival of investigators the company’s regular operation was halted until last week as the top management were said to have left the company.

Members of the management who have not showed up at their duties for two weeks include the country leader Feseha Zeru and other five top officials; namely: Gezahegn Ayele (Head of Finance Controlling) Abebaw Assefa (Senior Agronomist) Gudissa Geyessa (Territory and Health) Dereje Tullu (Territory and Health) and Ayenew Arega (Production Location Manager).

According to sources due to the growing disputes the company has not been able to carry out its daily activities since June 22 2021 while employees could not be paid their monthly salaries. Similarly the company has failed to sign and renew agreements with local growers who supply the improved seeds for the company.

Though the country leader and some of the top officials have not been in their offices as of late June sources said the managers and other few heads of department neither informed nor appointed acting heads during the time they stayed off.

However the country leader was said to have notified the Ministry of Trade last week that he left the company in line with the law which stipulates that a company cannot go on without top leadership for over a month.

Following his report to the Ministry the Ministry notified the company of the resignation of the top manager.

Furthermore The Reporter’s sources stated that the management of the regional body from South Africa has appointed interim leadership for three of the six vacant posts effective as of July 3. Accordingly Fasil Yilma has assumed the country leader position.

However according to the source all six of them have not returned the company cars they received. The cars are said to have cost the company 22 mln birr.

Ethiopian Government through the Ethiopian Seed Corporation and U.S.A’s Pioneer HI-Bred International Inc. joined together to set up Ethiopia’s first joint venture “Ethiopian Pioneer Hi-Bred Seeds Inc.” on December 4 1991.

The relationship between the joint venture Ethiopian Seed Corporation and Institute of Agricultural Research is not competitive but complementary and is an example of a symbiotic relationship between the public and private sector. Pioneer’s venture is also operating in developing producing processing and distributing facilities for hybrid seeds of maize sunflower sorghum alfalfa and various vegetable seeds. It seeks to reduce Ethiopia’s dependence on imported seeds thus saving foreign currency for the country.

The company has a big market share trading more than 4 billion birr annually by supplying hybrid seeds and other agricultural inputs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0dWZmLmNvLm56L3RhcmFuYWtpLWRhaWx5LW5ld3MvbmV3cy8xMjU4NTg1NzQvcG9saWNlLW1ha2luZy1lbnF1cmllcy1pbnRvLWJ1cm50LW91dC1jYXItYXQtYmFjay1iZWFjaNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Police making enquries into burnt out car at Back Beach,,,,,,,,,,

Update on Former Reality Star,"Reality series Shahs of Sunset doesn’t have the cast turnover that other Bravo shows do: Nine seasons in most of the original cast members are still on the call sheet. But not Asa Soltan Rahmati. Asa left after Season 6 and hasn’t been seen on the show — or elsewhere on television— since her brief reappearances during the Season 7. So why did Asa leave Shahs of Sunset?

Article continues below advertisement

Article continues below advertisement

Well it was all about family as she revealed on Instagram. “As you know last year I gave birth to Soltan Jackson my beautiful son” she wrote at the time. “[Boyfriend] Jermaine [Jackson Jr.] and I are completely overjoyed about being parents. Like all parents we want to provide Soltan with the best possible upbringing and we believe that is not being raised in front of the cameras. … These early years are very precious and it’s important for me to be present for as many cherished moments as possible.”

Asa told followers that her family was her “priority” and her business was her “focus.”

“My plate is currently so full with balancing all the elements of motherhood while also designing and running a successful business that is exploding” Asa added in that Instagram caption referring to her Asa Kaftans boutique. “In these joyful yet challenging times my priorities and focus are clear. Family being priority and work is my focus.”

And thus Asa decided to only have a minimal presence in Season 7. “I’ll really miss sharing my life with you this season” she wrote at the time. “And I will miss the usual shenanigans with my crew. By the way as any new parent knows I am dealing with a brand new set of shenanigans in this new Mami life.”

Former costar MJ Javid said she had an “unfortunate dynamic” with Asa.

In an August 2018 installment of Bravo’s podcast The Daily Dish two of Asa’s former Shahs of Sunset costars reacted to her departure from the show.

Article continues below advertisement

Shahs’ Mercedes “MJ” Javid for one said that her relationship with Asa had become strained on the show. “It was just an unfortunate dynamic” she explained. “I’m so open and I’m not passive-aggressive; if something bothers me I want to talk about it and if you try to have a friendship with someone who’s closed off and secretive then it just eventually lands on its face.”

Article continues below advertisement

But fellow Shahs star Reza Farahan said that he “totally” respected Asa’s decision to fly the coop. “She’s focused on her man and her baby and her business. And I don’t think it was a right fit for her anymore. She didn’t feel super open to the group and she has her own new smaller group now that she’s about.”

Now Asa is living in her own “life lane” but she thinks her time on ‘Shahs’ was an “amazing chapter.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

The dog foods were manufactured by Diamond Pet Foods.

The dog food is under the Kirkland store brand and is for Nature’s Bounty and Taste of The Wild which by the way I have used for more than 10 years.

Purchasers with or without receipts can get as much as $100 from the proposed settlement. With a receipt you could get up to $100 and $5 without. Costco keeps track of all your purchases so get a copy of your receipt from the membership desk.

Request for payment should be made by Oct. 4 by filling out this form which includes registering.

The recent proposed settlement covers anyone who bought the affected products after March 12 2017 and up to and including May 3 2021. The settlement which has had preliminary approval still needs a final approval from a federal judge. Diamond denied it did anything wrong – which is standard in this kinds of suits – but still agreed to the settlement.

The 2020 suit says that Costco’s and Diamond’s claims that the ingredients the safety of the Kirkland Products for dogs that may be “sensitive or allergic to grains are false.

“In fact the Kirkland Products contain significant amounts wheat.

“Plaintiffs’independent analysis of the ingredients of the Kirkland Products found that the Kirkland Products contain material amounts of wheat using the industry standard Q‐PCR method of DNA testing. By any scientific standard the wheat found within the Kirkland Products is greater than trace.”

These are the dog foods eligible for payment:

Barrett” embossed on them. Their business cards are issued to “Barrett Group” or “Barrett Connect.” Barrett happened to be a graphic designer for Chase and his name went on a card and it stuck.

American Express sample cards bear the name “C F Frost” but many years ago were issued to “John Q Public.” Frost was an Ogilvy & Mather executive who worked on the Amex account in the 1960s. Wells Fargo uses Henry Wells for obvious reasons.

Filed under “Today I Learned” I’ve just discovered who the Linda Walker is that has graced sample Citibank credit cards for 30 years.

This is the subject of occasional online speculation for instance wondering about Linda Walker’s total credit line from Citi and whether it’s advisable for her to have so many cards.

Even sample Costco reward certificates are issued to Linda Walker.

It turns out that just like at other issuers Linda Walker is a real person. She’s just retired from Citibank. For the past 10 years she’s overseen Citi’s anti-money laundering compliance. Before that she spent 14 years at UBS and Prudential. And from 1989 to 1997 she served as Associate General Counsel at Citi.

And it’s her name that’s appeared in Citibank card advertising for the last three decades.

[I]t was great that Citi paid tribute to my being the “Name That’s Synonymous with Citi Cards” stating in an internal article “When it comes to making a name for herself Linda Walker has set the bar pretty high. Her name is ubiquitous in its appearance on Citi branded cards featured on TV in digital marketing in print and as part of marketing mailers for the last three decades.”

And no she does not have one of every Citibank credit card issued in the past three decades..

Update: A Chase insider tells me that while their communications team has alternatively suggested ‘D Barrett’ is in customer service marketing or technology that isn’t correct – but that it is an employee who may prefer not to have her story told.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmludmVzdG9wZWRpYS5jb20vdXBkYXRlcy9kb25hbGQtdHJ1bXAtY29tcGFuaWVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Companies Former President Donald Trump Owns,"Donald Trump the Businessman

Donald J. Trump the nation's 45th president is unique among U.S. presidents in his connections to the business world. Certainly there have been presidents before him who were businessmen: both George H.W. Bush and his son George W. were in the oil business. Herbert Hoover was in mining and Warren G. Harding was in the newspaper business.

The difference is that every president before Trump had held one or more government positions before taking the office or had served as a general in the military.

This means that Trump's business record and the performance of his companies were the public's only basis for measuring his professional performance before he became president.

We know considerably more now although there is still much to know. Here's what we know and don't know about Trump's business dealings his successes and failures and his financial health as he left the presidency.

Key Takeaways Trump's businesses generated at least $446.3 million in sales in 2019. That dropped about 40% to $278 million in 2020.

The Trump National Doral golf resort generated the most revenue of any of the former president's businesses in 2019 posting $77.2 million in sales. Its revenue plunged more than 40% in 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic year.

Trump's net worth slipped to about $2.3 billion during his presidency compared to about $3 billion before he took office according to Bloomberg. Separately Forbes estimates his current wealth at $2.1 billion.

Separately Forbes estimates his current wealth at $2.1 billion. Trump's personal income is unknown because he lists business revenue instead of profit on his financial disclosures.

Mixing Business and Politics

Trump's potential conflicts of interest were a prominent topic throughout his tenure from 2017 through 2020. As president the enormous power he had at his command made it more important than ever to understand his long list of businesses and how they could intersect with his public role as president.

These conflicts of interest did not pose a legal problem for Trump. The president and vice president are explicitly exempt from ethics regulations concerning conflicts of interest.

There were other issues though such as the emoluments clause which was written into the U.S. Constitution by the nation's founders. The clause prohibits the president from accepting things of value from foreign governments.

Many critics say the emoluments clause applies to Trump in several respects. But none of the many legal cases alleging violations by the former president have been concluded nor does it look like they will be in the near future.

The President's Trust

Most U.S. presidents for the past 40 years chose to put their investments into a blind trust to avoid real or perceived conflicts between the president's financial interests and the nation's best interests.

The owner of a blind trust has no knowledge or control over what assets are in the trust. Their use is a guard against accusations that the powers of the presidency are being used to benefit the office holder's financial interests.

One exception was President Barack Obama who did not use a blind trust because his only investments were in such vehicles as index funds and Treasury notes which were unlikely to pose conflicts of interest.

To create a blind trust it is first necessary to liquidate all of the trust owner's current assets so that new ones can be placed into the trust. Trump's assets were largely in highly illiquid real estate. They would have been costly and time-consuming or even impossible to liquidate. For example Trump can't sell his minority stakes in some office towers without the consent of the real-estate investment trust Vornado Realty Trust (VNO).

So Trump ignored this presidential norm instead of placing his assets in a trust that was managed by his two eldest sons. He was able to withdraw funds from the trust at any time for any reason without disclosing it.

In fact Eric Trump one of the trustees told Forbes in early 2017 that he planned to regularly update his father on the Trump family businesses.

This practice violates trust documents stating that trustees ""shall not provide any report to Donald J. Trump on the holdings and sources of income of the Trust.""

The result was that the president's businesses were held by a trust controlled by his sons and the ability of the trust to insulate the former president from conflicts of interest was questionable.

What We Know

The former president's business activities are largely opaque for several reasons. Trump's main company formally called the Trump Organization is a privately held business and is therefore not required to publish quarterly earnings releases like publicly traded companies do.

The former president has also notably refused to release his tax returns contrary to the recent practice of presidents.

Trump's annual financial disclosures to the U.S. Office of Government Ethics had become the primary avenue to assess what businesses the former president owned and how much they were making.

Every year the president is required to file a list of assets income sources positions held outside the U.S. government business transactions liabilities and gifts received. But in some instances critics say the former president had been reluctant to fully comply with these disclosure requests by delaying filing and going to unusual lengths to avoid providing clear answers to the public.

On Sept. 27 2020 The New York Times released two stories containing data from some 20 years of Trump's tax returns. The full records have not been released.

What We Don't Know

There are some caveats to keep in mind when assessing the data in the Trump Organization's financial disclosure forms.

First the data is unaudited self-reported data meaning that readers have to take the company's word that it's accurate.

Second many of the numbers listed as ""income"" from certain assets seem instead to be the revenue from those businesses. This was confirmed when data from Trump's tax returns were released by The New York Times showing that many of the businesses have been losing money including some of the largest revenue producers such as Trump National Doral golf resort.

That being the case the financial numbers don't show the amount of money that the former president actually took home as income. For example in Trump's 2017 disclosure he listed his income for the Trump National Doral golf resort as $75 million which matches the revenue number reported to Miami-Dade County. Net operating income for the resort for that year was dramatically smaller at $4.3 million.

Getting a clear picture of the former president's businesses is further complicated by the fact that income and asset values are listed in very wide ranges. For example Mar-a-Lago Club is listed as having a value of ""over $50000000."" The Trump National Golf Club in Charlotte is listed as worth between $5 million and $25 million.

Contradictions

Yet another complication is that the Trump Organization itself has contradicted its own numbers in disclosures. The Trump Organization contested Palm Beach County's $19.7 million valuation for the Trump International Golf Club in Jupiter Florida as being too high.

But the former president's government disclosure to the Office of Government Ethics valued the property at more than $50 million. This inflated the value of the former president's property to the public even as he was trying to deflate its value for tax purposes.

This lack of information means that any attempt to put a number on the former president's net worth is at best an educated guess and would require more information than has been disclosed.

Equally important: Because we do not know the expenses of the businesses listed it is impossible to figure out Trump's personal income from his own disclosures.

The Investigations

Public prosecutors are trying to answer these and similar questions. Trump and his company are being investigated by the New York State attorney general over how the Trump Organization values assets on financial statements used to obtain loans.

The Manhattan district attorney appears to be investigating similar claims of inflated asset values. The former president's former lawyer Michael Cohen has testified that Trump regularly inflated the value of company assets to get better loan terms.

On Feb. 22 2021 the U.S. Supreme Court allowed a subpoena by Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. for Donald Trump's tax returns as well as other financial records. Due to grand jury secrecy rules they were not made public.

All of these developments cast doubt on the value of unaudited self-reported financial data from the Trump Organization.

Trump's Current Wealth

Despite these obstacles valuable information can be gleaned from Trump's financial disclosures especially in concert with other information.

Forbes has used financial disclosures and a plethora of other sources to come up with an estimate of Trump's net worth after he left office. The publication currently pegs it at around $2.4 billion. This should be regarded as a rough estimate even though the publication did as thorough a job as possible given the dearth of information.

This $2.4 billion represents a significant drop having fallen from $3.1 billion since the end of 2019. This is largely due to the damage COVID-19 has done to the hotel and casino industries.

The second important financial number we can glean from these documents is that Trump and his businesses generated a minimum of $446.3 million in revenue in 2019 which is up 2.6% from $434.8 million the previous year.

Also available are specific revenue numbers for some of Trump's business interests. The numbers provide a general idea of which Trump businesses are the largest revenue generators and whether revenue is rising or declining.

The Real Sources of Wealth

The former president's businesses generally fall into five categories: hotels golf courses (or some combination of the two) condos residential and commercial real-estate rentals and payments for the licensing of Trump's name.

The New York Times articles unleashed a major new source of information besides confirming that Donald Trump's disclosed income numbers were actually revenue figures.

The numbers also show that companies owned by Trump were incredibly unprofitable for the period between 2000 and 2018. His real sources of income were a television show and some licensing deals.

Although certain enterprises such as Trump Tower have been profitable Trump businesses overall lost $174.5 million from 2000–2018. During the same period of time his net income from licensing and endorsement deals was $230 million his net income from The Apprentice television show was $197.3 million and his income from other investments in companies run by other people was $178.7 million.

Top 5 Businesses Owned by Donald Trump

The list below is limited to businesses for which a specific revenue amount was given. The numbers are the latest available from documents.

1. Trump National Doral

2019 Revenue: $77207936

2018 Revenue: $75962848

2019 Asset Value: Over $50000000

Business Type: Golf Resort

What is now the Trump National Doral golf resort was founded in 1962 in Doral near Miami. Trump bought the resort out of bankruptcy for $150 million in 2012.

The Doral was the source of considerable controversy in 2019 when the former president announced plans to hold the 2020 meeting of the G7 at Trump National Doral. He withdrew the proposal after accusations that this was an attempt to profit from his presidency.

2. Trump Old Post Office LLC

2019 Revenue: $40523041

2018 Revenue: $40842294

2019 Asset Value: Over $50000000

Business Type: Hotel

This business is a holding company for the Trump International Hotel in Washington D.C. which operates in the Old Post Office building a national landmark. Trump's company holds a long-term lease on the property owned by the U.S. government which could last nearly 100 years with extensions.

The hotel was at the center of a major emoluments case against the former president. A group of hotel and restaurant owners sued Trump for violating the emoluments clause alleging that he was unconstitutionally profiting from his office because his hotel gets the business of foreign officials staying there to curry his favor. The group argued that this gave the former president's hotel an unfair competitive advantage against their businesses.

Possibly as a result of lawsuits and public criticism the Trump Organization planned to sell its lease to the property. They were seeking a purchase price of more than $500 million one of the highest-priced hotel deals per room ever. The sale process was placed on hold due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

3. Trump Ruffin Tower LLC

2019 Revenue: $27677448 divided between $4414500 in condo sales and $23262948 in hotel revenue

2018 Revenue: $28558298 divided between $6002244 in condo sales and $22556054 in hotel revenue

2019 Asset Value: Over $50000000

Business Type: Hotel and Condominium Complex

Trump Ruffin Tower LLC manages the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Las Vegas. Constructed in 2008 the tower is a combination hotel and condominium development.

It struggled as the Great Recession hit when it opened more than a decade ago devastating the real estate market. Plans for a second tower were scrapped.

4. Trump Turnberry

2019 Revenue: 25691318

2018 Revenue: $23446634

2019 Asset Value: Over $50000000

Business Type: Golf Resort

Originally built in 1906 by Archibald Kennedy the third Marquess of Ailsa Trump Turnberry is one of two golf resorts the former president owns in Scotland.

Trump purchased the Turnberry resort from a Dubai-based company for an undisclosed sum.

5. Mar-a-Lago Club LLC

2019 Revenue: 21432344

2018 Revenue: $22692146

2019 Asset Value: Over $50000000

Business Type: Hotel and Resort

The Mar-a-Lago Club was built as a private mansion in 1927 by Marjorie Merriweather Post who inherited the Postum Cereal Company which later became the General Foods Corporation.

In 1968 she decided to donate Mar-a-Lago to the U.S. government to serve as a winter White House. When she died in 1973 the government refused the gift due to its high maintenance costs.

The estate was purchased by Trump in 1985 for a reported $8 million. He used it as a winter White House and continues to operate it as a private resort club.

2020 Challenges

The year 2020 was challenging for the former president's businesses because the COVID-19 pandemic hit the hospitality industry hard.

A study by the American Hotel & Lodging Association (AHLA) found that nearly nine in 10 hotels resorted to furloughs or layoffs in 2020. More than half of the hotel owners surveyed said they were in danger of losing their properties to foreclosure.

The Trump Organization laid off roughly 1500 employees due to COVID-19 as of the beginning of April 2020 including 560 at Trump National Doral.

Trump's largest business by revenue Trump National Doral had to close in March along with many of his other properties.

It reopened in June 2020 along with several other Trump hotels.

Trump's Failed Businesses

Trump's current businesses give only a partial picture of his record as a businessman. Over the course of his several decades as a real estate executive he has created a long list of companies that have been sold or dissolved or which have gone bankrupt.

Trump companies have filed for bankruptcy six separate times a fact Trump has bragged about saying he has ""used brilliantly the laws of the country.""

One Decade of Business Dealings

A useful snapshot is Trump's record during the 10 years before he won the presidency. From 2006–2016 The New York Times went through every business deal that the Trump Organization announced or that was reported.

The 60 deals reflected a highly uneven track record of business success: ""One-third of them never got off the ground or soon petered out. Another third delivered a measure of what was promised—buildings were built courses taught a product introduced—but they also encountered substantial problems like lawsuits government investigations partnership woes or market downturns...The remaining third while sometimes encountering strife generally met expectations"" according to The New York Times.

Any deeper examination of the former president's business record would be incomplete without looking at his series of high-profile bankruptcies and other failures. Below is a list of some of the highlights although it is by no means comprehensive.

Trump's Casinos

In the early 1990s Donald Trump faced personal bankruptcy due to large personal debts deteriorating finances and a trio of money-losing casinos in Atlantic City. His largest casino Trump Taj Mahal had already declared bankruptcy in 1991.

To deal with this Trump launched an initial public offering (IPO) of Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts. The public offering raised enough money for Trump to avoid personal bankruptcy and allowed him to offload his heavily indebted casinos to investors. Trump stepped down in 2009 as chairperson of the company whose name had been changed to Trump Entertainment Resorts in 2005.

By then the company had gone through bankruptcy twice and investors had lost ""well over 90 cents on the dollar"" according to billionaire Warren Buffett.

Trump Entertainment Resorts went back into bankruptcy in 2014 and was sold to Icahn Enterprises (IEP) in 2016 resulting in Trump losing his stake in the company. The Taj Mahal which Trump spent $1.2 billion to build in 1990 was later sold by Icahn Enterprises for $50 million or 4% of its cost to Hard Rock International in 2017.

Trump Model Management

Trump Model Management was a modeling agency Trump founded. The company is a natural extension of Trump's interest in beauty pageants with his production company formerly producing Miss USA pageants and a TV tie-in titled Pageant Place.

In April 2017 news that Trump Model Management would shut down surfaced after an email from the company's president leaked. Some speculate that the decision to shut down was due to the accusations from some foreign-born former models that they had been hired without the necessary work visas.

Trump Model Management denied using illegal labor practices. Trump himself held an 85% stake in the business before it dissolved.

The Trump Entrepreneur Initiative

The now-defunct Trump Entrepreneur Initiative was once known as Trump University. The for-profit education company offered courses in real estate asset management entrepreneurship and wealth creation.

The company was not an accredited school and did not offer high school or college credits.

The company was embroiled in an ongoing high-profile scandal during Trump's presidential campaign and it continued into his tenure as president.

The Trump Entrepreneur Initiative faced a lawsuit in 2013 alleging illegal business practices. The New York state attorney general filed a $40 million civil suit that alleged the corporation made false promises to its students.

A New York judge found Trump personally responsible. In late March 2017 when Trump was serving as president a judge approved a $25 million settlement for the defrauded students.

Trump Ice Natural Spring Water

Trump Ice was a bottled water brand. The winner of The Apprentice Season 2 Kelly Perdew served as executive vice president of the organization.

The company's website no longer exists and the product can no longer be found in national grocery chains or stores but some can still be found on eBay and other auction sites.

The company was used as a gimmick in the show's first season when contestants marketed and sold the product.

Trump Steaks

Launched in 2007 Trump Steaks was a line of beef products sold exclusively by The Sharper Image and QVC. Due to poor sales the products were removed from distribution after just two months."

The environmental cleanup is continuing after a train derailment involving hazardous materials last week in McDavid.

Twenty-five cars of a southbound CSX train derailed in a heavily wooded area a mile north of the West Fraser Sawmill about 10:35 p.m. the night of July 19. Several tanker and hopper cars were among those scattered about the tracks during the derailment.

According to the Florida Department of Environment Management two of the cars were carrying ammonium nitrate and molten sulfur both hazardous materials.

“None has been released and it remains safely contained within the cars. A small amount of limestone gravel and (nonhazardous) methionine however has spilled” FDEP Press Secretary Alexandra Kuchta told NorthEscambia.com in an email late Friday afternoon.

Three of the cars spilled limestone rock adjacent to the tracks. CSX confirmed to NorthEscambia.com.

“The incident site is currently stabilized and the responsible party will now move forward with the removal of the spilled materials and any necessary assessment and remediation due to the derailment. DEP will continue its stringent oversight to ensure any threats to the environment and human safety are quickly and effectively addressed” Kuchta said.

The train engine came to a stop behind the sawmill but due to the remote area of the site with no nearby roads it took first responders about 45 minutes to locate and reach the area of derailment using a UTV and four-wheel drive vehicles on dirt hunting camp roads.

Escambia County interim Public Safety Director Eric Gilmore who is also the volunteer chief of the McDavid Station of Fire Rescue was the first to reach the site on foot Monday night. He described the site as a “total pileup” with railcars on top of one another and tracks that were destroyed.

The Escambia Fire Rescue Hazmat team conducted a visual inspection of the derailment Monday night and then utilized monitoring equipment to take air samples and determine that there was no immediate public health threat.

CSX said the train was headed from Nashville to Pensacola. The exact cause of the derailment remains under investigation.

There were no injuries reported.

The derailment was just north of the site of a January 28 2014 derailment during a rare North Escambia ice storm. As much as 30000 gallons of corrosive acid spilled into Fletcher Creek during that incident leading to a lengthy environmental cleanup.

James McGonagle 24 was remanded into custody following his arraignment in Queens Supreme Court on a two-count indictment charging him with attempted kidnapping and child endangerment prosecutors said.

McGonagle of Fresh Meadows faces up to fifteen years in prison if convicted.

Disturbing surveillance video of the July 17 incident allegedly showed McGonagle sprinting out of a parked car and grabbing little Jacob Diaz who was walking with his mom and siblings in Richmond Hill.

McGonagle then allegedly shoved the boy into the backseat of the vehicle — prompting mom Dolores Diaz Lopez to jump into action.

The heroic mom desperately tried to free her son as McGonagle allegedly “clutched the child’s legs from the opposite side of the car and attempted to pull him back into the vehicle” the Queens District Attorney’s Office said in a statement.

Diaz Lopez 45 was able to free her from the car before the creep sped away.

A male passenger seen in the video — whom police sources previously told The Post is McGonagle’s 55 year-old father also named James McGonagle — was apparently unaware of his son’s intentions.

Moments before the terrifying incident the passenger could be heard asking “What are you doing?” to which McGonagle allegedly responded “We are taking the kid” prosecutors said.

McGonagle was arrested the following morning at Brookdale Hospital after police spotted him being treated for injuries to his face the DA’s office said.

Queens District Attorney Melinda Katz called the incident “a parent’s worst fear” and praised Diaz Lopez for her courage.

“In a brazen fashion the defendant grabbed the little boy who was just a few steps from his mother and allegedly tried to kidnap him” Katz said in a statement.

“This is a parent’s worst fear. This mother fought to save her son. Never underestimate the strength of a mom. Thankfully he has been apprehended and will face justice.”

McGonagle is due back in court on Sept. 8.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay90dnNob3diaXovYXJ0aWNsZS05ODIxNTg5L1NlYW4tUGVubi1jaGF0cy1mcmllbmQtc2hvcHBpbmctTWFsaWJ1Lmh0bWzSAWVodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvdHZzaG93Yml6L2FydGljbGUtOTgyMTU4OS9hbXAvU2Vhbi1QZW5uLWNoYXRzLWZyaWVuZC1zaG9wcGluZy1NYWxpYnUuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sean Penn chats with a friend while shopping in Malibu,"He announced earlier that he wouldn't be returning to finish filming his Starz limited series Gaslit until every crew member had been vaccinated against the novel coronavirus.

And Sean Penn was spotted out during his newfound downtime when he dropped by a CVS pharmacy in Malibu on Friday to do some quick shopping.

The 60-year-old two-time Oscar winner was seen stopping to chat with a friend before heading away in his truck.

Catching up: Sean Penn 60 was spotted out in Malibu on Friday as he shopped at a CVS pharmacy and ran into a friend that he stopped to chat with

Sean looked totally relaxed in a pale blue denim shirt that he wore untucked and with the top few buttons undone.

He contrasted it with a weathered set of khaki cargo shorts and brown flip flops.

After catching up he hopped into his vehicle which had a sign on the driver's door for Community Organized Relief Effort (CORE) which has supplied necessary supplies to fight Covid-19 since last year.

The non-profit was originally founded by Penn in 2010 in response to the massive Haitian earthquake but it changed is name and expanded its focus starting in 2019.

Starting in 2020 CORE began setting up coronavirus testing sites and it has since expanded into distributing Covid-19 vaccines.

Charity work: Penn was seen climbing into his truck afterward which had a CORE sign for his non-profit organization that helps to provide Covid-19 vaccines and tests

Penn was back in the news on Thursday after he took a stand in favor of coronavirus vaccines on his Watergate-era miniseries Gaslit which also stars Julia Roberts.

NBCUniversal which is producing the series had original required all cast members and all crew in close proximity to them to get vaccinated but crew members with a less-direct connection to the cast were required to be vaccinated.

But as the more-contagious Delta variant of the novel coronavirus spreads through Los Angeles and the rest of the community Penn took a stand and told the production he wouldn't return to finish his last few weeks on the project until everyone involved with the project has been vaccinated.

However the Mystic River star was willing to sweeten his deal by offering to pay for all vaccinations via his CORE organization so it wouldn't cost the production anything to comply.

According to Deadline Penn isn't worried about his own safety as he's already vaccinated. Instead he's focused on keeping everyone else in the production safe as it would be easy for an infected person to spread the more-contagious variant in a closed space if they're not vaccinated.

Taking a stand: The actor announced on Thursday that he wouldn't return to his Starz miniseries Gaslit until everyone on the production was vaccinated; seen July 11 in Cannes France

Penn recently returned to the US after visiting the Cannes Film Festival in France to present his newest film Flag Day which he directed and stars in.

He stars as John Vogel a petty criminal and forger who tries to go straight after his teenage daughter (played by Dylan Penn the actor's real-life daughter) moves in with him.

The film was widely considered a failure after its Cannes premiere and earned a paltry 35 percent rotten rating among critics surveyed by Rotten Tomatoes.

Several reviews described the movie as 'heavy-handed' and 'melodramatic' and Little White Lies' Mark Asch wrote witheringly that 'everyone in this movie is doing career-worst work.'

On Sunday July 25 the head of the Danaher Death Squad John Danaher announced the end of an era.

Danaher Death Squad Announces Retirement

The team that consisted of the best grappler of all time Gordon Ryan his brother Nicky Ryan Garry Tonon Nicky Rodriguez Oliver Taza Craig Jones and many more will now move on to do their own individual things.

Below is what Danaher posted on his official Instagram page.

“End of an era: It is with great sadness that I have to announce the break up of the squad as a unified training and competition team. A combination of factors revolving around disagreements in physical location of a future school personality conflicts conflicting values and an inevitable tension between the team brand and the growing individual brands of members were the main factors. I am immensely proud of the tremendous effect the squad had upon the development and direction of our beloved sport over the years. I am extremely confident that all the various team members have risen in competitive ability teaching skill and independent creativity that they will be highly successful wherever they choose to go – whatever happens their legacy is assured and their future very bright indeed. As for the future it is still uncertain. Most of us still get along very well. I expect some will still train together and we will work together in future projects in accordance with our team philosophy but no longer as a single unified room. I believe the split will have the positive effect of creating a larger footprint for the team as they spread out and develop a wider influence. I always believed that the technical development of the team was best created by a tight unified room but at the end of the day human happiness outweighs medals and martial skill and it has become clear that some individual members would be happier in different locations. I would like to thank all the members of the squad for the tremendous effort and myriad sacrifices they made to build a team and legacy that will be remembered in particular Garry Tonon Gordon Ryan Craig Jones Eddie Cummings Nicky Ryan and Nick Rodriguez. I would also like to thank the many students who formed the room in which the squad developed and honed their skills; and thank you so much to all our faithful followers for your interest and support over the years – I hope and trust we can keep the project of refining our art going despite the changes – Thank you.”

During the COVID-19 pandemic teams found is very difficult to get the training in. Well the Danaher Death Squad crew made a judgement call and moved the entire squad to Puerto Rico.

Gordon Ryan made multiple posts about the retirement of the Danaher Death Squad on Saturday as well.

“As many of you have heard the DDS is now retired. First and foremost I want to issue an apology to our fans. I know I promised you all information on the school and affiliate program but before we could make our announcements the team decided to split which obviously changed plans. I will have an update at some point eventually on those concerns😂. More than anything I am happy that I got to share the mats all these years with such intuitive and interesting grapplers. I enjoyed helping them pursue their goals and an grateful they helped me pursue mine. I’m sure that no matter what happens and no matter where we all end up this team has changed jiu jitsu forever and that’s something no one can deny. On to a new start and always looking to be the best me I can be.”

The implications of higher inflation and COVID-19 infection rates for the food industry

A recent Food Institute study found that among G20 economies countries with higher COVID-19 infection rates are experiencing higher inflation. With that what are the implications for the food industry? Let’s take a closer look.

Higher inflation and COVID-19 infection rates

The Federal Reserve acknowledged that inflation has increased “notably” and COVID-19 still poses risks to the recovery. At the center of the current inflation debate is the question of when will the pandemic be contained to the degree that the economy can return to “normalcy.” Waves of the pandemic especially the surging Delta variant created uncertainties for the economy. And these uncertainties exacerbated the mismatch between supply and demand which in turn sparked inflation growth.

In The Food Institute study we found that among G20 economies countries that have been more affected by the pandemic are experiencing higher rates of inflation. In the initial study we divided the countries into two groups by the number of COVID-19 cases as well as the infection rate (number of COVID-19 cases / number of tests). Then computed the average inflation rate for each group based on each country’s latest CPI or similar measure. In further analysis we excluded outliers (countries that had extremely high or low inflation prior to the pandemic). In other words their high/low rate of inflation is not necessarily a result of the pandemic.

After excluding outliers the first group (high COVID-19 cases) had an average inflation rate of 5.31% and the second group (low cases) had an average inflation rate of 1.68%. In other words consumer price increases among high-infection countries were more than triple those of low-infection countries. Moreover when compared to 2019 (i.e. pre-pandemic) the first group experienced an increase in inflation by 1.52% while the second group experienced a decrease in inflation by 0.28%.

Public health policy changes and implications for the food industry

The recent surge of Delta variant cases suggests that the U.S. has entered a fourth wave of the pandemic. Pending FDA’s full approval businesses and government agencies will likely require vaccinations for their employees and customers.

In the U.K. the government will launch daily COVID testing of food sector workers to tackle its ‘pingdemic.”

In France the government requires “vaccine passport” for anyone who wants to enter a theater museum theme park cultural center shopping mall train bus restaurant bar or cafe.

In China the government partnered with McDonald’s to offer free ice cream to boost its vaccination efforts.

A number of food-related companies are stepping up ahead of government mandates:

ALDI Chobani Darden Restaurants McDonald’s Starbucks Target and Trader Joe’s are providing paid time off for vaccinations.

Amazon Lidl Bolthouse Farms Instacart JBS USA Pilgrim’s and Kroger are giving employees cash bonuses to get vaccinated.

Amazon is also providing on-site vaccination for its U.S. front-line employees. Bolthouse Farms and Houston’s Legacy Restaurants hosted vaccine “pop-ups.”

Michelin-starred restaurant Eleven Madison Park requires all workers to be vaccinated.

Safety and Mobility are keys to return to normalcy

In a recent update of the “Anticipated Vaccine Adoption & Impact on the CPG Industry” report IRI pointed out that consumers’ willingness to restore normal work and shopping patterns will depend on vaccine adoption. Understanding the evolution of social mobility is key to assess demand and supply in the foreseeable future. In the framework of a “new normal” IRI’s current forecast of resuming “normal” mobility is summer 2022.

Projecting future inflation is a more difficult task. “I think trying to predict where inflation is going to be in a few years is a mug’s game” said Kristin Forbes an economist at M.I.T. and a former official at the United States Treasury and the Bank of England. “Policymakers need to be ready for different scenarios…If things recover faster than expected we know how to deal with that. If things don’t recover that’s a harder situation.” The longer and to a greater degree that the pandemic can’t be contained the more challenging it will be for both consumers and businesses.

Phil Murphy’s desk awaiting action: Change the way people wager so it feels more like sports betting.

Since the 1930s horse bets have relied on pari-mutuel wagering – in which the odds and payoffs are determined after the entire pool of bets is collected. A bet placed when a horse appears to have 5:1 odds could shrink to 2:1 by race time.

A bill unanimously approved by lawmakers last month would introduce fixed-odds wagering – in which odds are locked in when a person buys their ticket. Both types of wagers would be offered.

Dennis Drazin chairman and chief executive officer of Monmouth Park whose track already hired a company to manage the new system in anticipation of its approval said it will expand horse racing beyond its limited audience.

“In the sports betting world in the iGaming world you have 20 times the amount of eyes that are looking to make wagers than we currently have with our pool in the racing industry” said Drazin who substantially wrote the bill approved by the Legislature.

Lobbyist Bill Pascrell III who represents Monmouth Park and BetMakers the Australian technology company that will manage that track’s fixed-odds wagering said the current pari-mutuel system is antiquated and doesn’t appeal to younger bettors.

“If we don’t do fixed odds within the next 10 years and perhaps even sooner the horse racing industry is going to die on the vine” Pascrell said.

Pascrell said North Carolina Oregon Ohio Colorado and Oklahoma are working on fixed-odds horse betting – but that New Jersey should try to be first.

Assemblyman Ron Dancer R-Ocean said the new approach can help revive the horse racing industry.

“We’ve seen models in other nations like Australia where it’s been very successful” Dancer said.

The bill took two years to develop and was amended to the very end with Chris McErlean president of Freehold Raceway and others worried about how revenues are split.

“Make it successful for everyone and every stakeholder in the industry not just one group one breed or one vendor” McErlean said.

The final set of amendments that helped get the bill through the Legislature clarified that all the money from fixed-odds wagering on in-state thoroughbred races will go to thoroughbred overnight purses and money from wagers on in-state standardbred races will go toward standardbred purses.

The same will be true for fixed-odds bets on out-of-state races handled by Monmouth Park and online casinos. But it will be different at the Meadowlands Racetrack and Freehold Raceway at which 65% of fixed-odds revenues will go toward thoroughbred races and 35% toward standardbred races.

The late changes didn’t address concerns from horse breeders whose share of revenues from fixed-odds wagering will be half of the share from pari-mutuel wagers.

“They understand it could grow the industry but then they don’t see how that growth gets translated back to the horsemen themselves and the people they need to pay to keep the industry up and running” said Ed Wengryn research associate for the New Jersey Farm Bureau.

Drazin said they will still do well as the amount wagered will increase – and that under the new approach tracks assume more risk and therefore deserve a bigger share.

Daily American Correspondent

Coming back for a second year the Maple City Classic Tractor Roundup at the Somerset County Fairgrounds in Meyersdale last weekend closed out with another great year.

""We were exceptionally pleased with the turnout"" said Dave Berkey one of the organizers. ""Many people came back and there were new entries as well. We had to adjust some scheduling on Saturday because of the rain but that is not unusual with any outdoor event. In all we now see this event as an annual homecoming when people plan their schedules around it.""

Dave and Tina Berkey of the Boswell area and Don and Annette Knotts from the Wellersburg area started this show last year in the midst of a pandemic and it was well received. Now after this year they are quick to point out that it has become a new type of festival for those who just want to come to the fairgrounds and peacefully stroll around and see the tractor displays or watch the horse pull.

According to Annette Knotts there were 89 tractors entered in the three-day event and 16 teams of draft horses in the horse pull on Sunday from Pennsylvania and the nearby states of Ohio and Maryland. Some came from as far as Kentucky Maine and Florida.

Bring out the collection

For Frankie and Chris Lease of Wellersburg the tractor show meant an opportunity to bring out some of their prized collections including a family-owned 1948 John Deere M and a rare yellow-painted John Deere M Industrial.

""We started all this because of my dad's tractor"" said Chris Lease who retired a few years ago from a dentist office in Allegany County Maryland. ""About five years ago we were at a Mount Savage Maryland Labor Day parade watching the tractors and I thought to myself 'When I retire we are going to do this.'""

Chris's father the late Raymond Lepley who died in 2009 had owned a 1948 John Deere M that he bought new at Jackson's dealership in Meyersdale and had used at his farm near Mount Savage Maryland for decades.

The problem however is that the farm tractor was sold out of the family. A few years before Raymond Lepley died he sold his 1948 model to Ron Weimer who then later died. The tractor was sold again at Weimer's farm sale to Dale McKenzie.

Chris's husband Frankie talked with McKenzie about purchasing the tractor but he was hesitant at first.

""Most women want jewelry or clothing for a retirement gift but she (Chris) wanted her dad's tractor"" Frankie Lease said with a laugh. ""Dale McKenzie sold it to me the day before she retired and also just before McKenzie had planned to sell it at Wright Auction. He said he just wanted to see it 'go home.'""

That first purchase of the old family farm tractor started something because the Lease family now has 10 John Deere tractors including a 1933 D a 1952 M Tricycle a 1930 GP a 1935 B unstyled a 1944 A and a rare yellow MI (industrial) John Deere — one of only 1000 made in 1951.

""We started with one and now we have 10"" Frankie said ""but it has been very rewarding for the whole family and we love the Maple City show because it is relaxing and under roof.""

Hay baler

Also on display was Larry Hemminger's mini International hay baler that his father Jay Hemminger and Ed Sipe hand-built to take to shows and festivals. They even cut out draft horses from plywood and had them painted in Lancaster County to add to the effect of a real hay making display.

""The baler actually bales hay and we take this around to shows and festivals like the Chickentown tractor show and the New Centerville Jubilee to demonstrate how a baler works on the farm without bringing a real one"" Larry Hemminger said.

Horse pull winners

At the horse pull Freddie Decker of Brundel Maine crossed the winning load with Belgian drafts named ""Chip"" and ""Kurt"" who held the audience's attention for the winning loads. The Decker and Chase team went on to win the heavyweight championship.

The Yoder Hatfield and Brown team from Acme came in second followed by Mike Buhler of Ridgeway in third. Butch Lepley of Meyersdale came in fourth; Jim Suter of Somerset in fifth; Lepley and Ritchey in sixth; Dan and Russ Ferrigen of Shelocta seventh; and Brandon Lepley of Meyersdale in eighth.

In the lightweight division Yoder and Hatfield from Cromwell Kentucky won first and Gilbert Yoder and Hatfield of Kentucky won second. Adams and Specht of Orangeville won third followed by Stackhouse and Gilbert of Stanford Kentucky in fourth. Boo Dove of Harwood Maryland won fifth. Bill Vines of Ravenna Ohio came in sixth and seventh with two separate teams followed by Ray Long of Sidman in eighth.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZXRyb2l0bmV3cy5jb20vc3Rvcnkvc3BvcnRzL2dvbGYvMjAyMS8wNy8yNS9zdW5kYXlzLWdvbGYtY2FtZXJvbi1jaGFtcC1mZW5kcy1vZmYtaGVhdC13aW4tMy1tLW9wZW4tMi1zdHJva2VzLzgwODgyMzQwMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sunday's golf: Cameron Champ fends off heat to win 3M Open by 2 strokes,"Associated Press

Blaine Minn. — Cameron Champ was struggling mightily through the first half of this year a frustrating series of performances that pointed him back to his state of mind more than any mechanical flaw.

Like many newlyweds the 26-year-old was distracted by the delicate balance of passionately pursuing his career while still trying to carve out a healthy personal life at home. He found himself becoming much too upset by a bad round.

There sure wasn't much for Champ to be mad about at the 3M Open.

Champ fended off dehydration and crisply putted his way to a 5-under 66 on Sunday winning by two strokes for his third career victory.

“I just took a complete 180 in how I’m waking up every morning and how I’m reacting to certain things and adjusting to certain things” said Champ who had five birdies in a bogey-free round to finish at 15-under 269 at TPC Twin Cities.

Louis Oosthuizen Jhonattan Vegas and Charl Schwartzel tied for second. Keith Mitchell was fifth at 12 under and behind him were five players tied for sixth.

Champ joined Collin Morikawa Jon Rahm and Bryson DeChambeau as the only under-28 players to win in each of the last three seasons on tour. He jumped from 142nd to 49th in the FedEx Cup standings with the top 125 qualifying for the playoff opener.

This month has brought quite the turnaround for the Texas A&M product after nine missed cuts and one withdrawal over his first 16 starts of 2021. The best finish in that stretch was a tie for 17th at the Zurich Classic of New Orleans.

Champ hit the reset button after missing the cut at the Rocket Mortgage Classic in Detroit three weeks ago though and emerged with a tie for 11th at the John Deere Classic in Illinois.

“After Detroit I just took a step back and said ‘You know what? This is enough. I can’t keep going on this way. I’m not enjoying the game’” Champ said.

His wife Jessica was surely happy to hear that.

“It’s more so realizing what I want to do in the game of golf and then who I want to be at home. It’s a balance you have to find and if you don’t it can really haunt you and it can cause a lot of issues"" Champ said. “So I just feel like the last two months I’ve been in a lot better head space.”

During another 90-degree day Champ was far from his physical best. He felt some dizziness along the back nine putting his hands on his knees at one point as he hung his head to try to regain some composure. He had plenty of it on the last hole after his safe strategy with the tee shot to stay away from the lake landed way left in a trampled sandy area directly behind a clump of trees.

Champ managed to chip out onto the primary rough then scoot up the fairway. His approach was a beauty that landed perfectly and rolled back toward the pin. He sank the easy par putt and had enough energy to pump his arms in celebration of his first top-10 finish since last October.

“The Gatorade definitely helped I think keep me going” said Champ who won the Sanderson Farms Championship in 2019 the year he turned pro and the Safeway Open in 2020.

He had the best putting performance of the 3M Open field with an average of 8.48 strokes gained.

Oosthuizen shot 66 too in a much stronger finish than the previous weekend at the British Open where his 54-hole lead turned into a tie for third after a fourth-round 71.

Playing six pairs ahead of Champ Oosthuizen birdied three of the last four holes to give himself an outside chance. His approach to the 18th green almost yielded an eagle on the PGA Tour’s hardest par-5 hole but the ball lipped out. Oosthuizen made a 2 1/2 foot putt for birdie instead and his fourth runner-up finish in seven starts. Schwartzel his fellow South African posted a 68 to match Vegas in the final round.

“We had a good time here this week and I’m just trying to see if I can go one better than all these seconds and thirds” Oosthuizen said.

Cameron Tringale a one-stroke leader after the third round took a triple bogey on the par-3 13th hole right after consecutive birdies had brought him back into contention. He shot 74 and finished six strokes behind Champ leaving PGA Championship winner Phil Mickelson as the only 54-hole leader or co-leader to win in the last 13 tour events.

Matthew Wolff (2019) and Michael Thompson (2020) the first two winners of the 3M Open each finished in a tie for 39th place at 5-under.

Newly minted Olympian Patrick Reed tied for 34th at 6 under before heading home to Texas to get ready for Tokyo. He found out Saturday he'd been added to the U.S. team after DeChambeau tested positive for COVID-19.

“Once I start an event"" Reed said ""I’m definitely going to finish the event.”

PGA Senior Tour

Sunningdale England — Stephen Dodd birdied the final hole to win the Senior British Open by one stroke on Sunday holding off challenges from Miguel Angel Jimenez and Darren Clarke to secure his first major title.

The 55-year-old Welshman closed with a 2-under 68 at Sunningdale for a four-day total of 13-under 267. He hit his approach from the right rough to about 10 feet on the par-4 18th and holed the putt to win the trophy and a spot in next year's British Open at St. Andrews.

“This could be the only chance I get to win so tried my best to hole it” Dodd said. “Thankfully for me it went in so it was a nice way to finish for me.”

Jimenez the 2018 winner shot 65 to finish at 12 under while Clarke (67) was another shot behind.

Dodd equaled the low round in the history of the tournament on Saturday with an 8-under 62 that gave him a two-shot lead heading into the final round of the last senior major championship of the year.

He had only played one tournament in the past 18 months.

“Expectation-wise I didn’t really have any expectations because as I said I played so little competitive golf that I just wanted to play well and just do myself a bit of justice” Dodd said “and I think I’ve done a bit more than that luckily.”

Defending champion Bernhard Langer (68) was fourth another two shots back. The 63-year-old Langer won in 2019 at Royal Lytham & St. Annes for his fourth victory in the event. Last year's tournament was canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic.

Two-time British Open champion Ernie Els (72) tied for eighth.

A three-time European Tour winner Dodd made his senior debut at the Senior British Open in 2016 when he had his previously best finish at the event — a share of 14th place.

He didn't realize until after he won that he'd earned the exemption to play at St. Andrews.

“That will be special” he said. “I'll have to start trying to hit it a bit harder and further.”

LPGA

Evian-Les-Bains France — Australian golfer Minjee Lee won a sudden death playoff against overnight leader Jeongeun Lee6 to clinch the Evian Championship on Sunday for her first major title.

Lee6 had to take a drop shot when her second shot on the first extra playoff hole flew into a pond while Lee’s superb second attempt landed near the flag.

Lee6 ended with a bogey to give the 25-year-old Lee three putts for victory and a sixth LPGA title.

She missed the first but made the second and was doused in Champagne by 2015 Evian champion Lydia Ko.

“I’m speechless ... been waiting for this for so long. It just feels unreal to have won. In the playoff and all throughout today I played really well to get myself in that position"" she said. ""I put a lot of pressure on myself to perform it’s just really nice to have a major title under my belt.""

Her younger brother Min Woo Lee has two wins on the men’s European Tour. He won the Scottish Open two weeks ago — also in a playoff and on the first extra hole.

“When we were really little we used to go down to the driving range with Mom” she said. “We would just practice.”

Lee is the first Australian to win at Evian since seven-time major winner Karrie Webb in 2006 before it was a major.

“Actually she did message me straightaway” Lee said of the 41-time LPGA Tour winner. “She messages me quite a bit ... it’s just really nice of her.”

Lee and Lee6 had finished the fourth round at 18 under overall but in vastly different circumstances.

Lee trailed Lee6 by seven shots overnight but drew level with a superb 7-under 64 in the final round which included four birdies on the last five holes. After drifting away Lee6 (71) hit back with three straight birdies to force a playoff.

Teenage American Yealimi Noh (67) finished third on 17 under when she missed a birdie chance on the 18th.

“A lot of positives it’s been my best major finish” the 19-year-old Noh said.

Lee and Lee6 both teed off strongly in the 18th-hole playoff.

Lee went for a 5-iron on her second shot but caddie Jason Gilroyed advised her to switch to a 6-iron and was proved right.

“I think the yardage was for 5-iron but with adrenaline and everything Gilly was like ‘Let’s go 6-iron’” she said. “It was six feet from the hole. Yeah it worked out.”

That increased the pressure on Lee6 whose tense shot flew into the water. Her head dropped as she knew her chances of a second major had just gone. She won the U.S. Women’s Open in 2019.

The day’s best round went to Ireland’s Leona Maguire. Her 10-under 61 tied the lowest round ever by a female or male in a major — two days after Lee6 did the same in the second round. They share the record with South Korea's Hyo Joo Kim who also did it at Evian in 2014.

Japan’s Ayaka Furue finished fourth ahead of 18-year-old Thai Atthaya Thitikul.

Maguire tied for sixth with Ko England’s Georgia Hall and South Korea’s In Gee Chun.

Top-ranked Nelly Korda (67) tied 19th and defending champion Jin Young Ko was 60th.

Lee6's big lead evaporated after eight holes as Noh moved level at 15 under. By hole No. 14 Noh led by one stroke from Lee6 and Lee who moved level with her with a birdie on 15 and one ahead after another on 16.

Lee held a tricky par on No. 17 and Noh put her hand on her face in frustration after missing a birdie on the 16th. Lee6 sank a birdie on that hole to pull level with Noh.

Lee6 and Noh then made birdies on No. 17 to stay one shot back from Lee and give themselves a chance.

Lee snacked on some fruit while she waited for them to finish the 18th then realized there could be a playoff and started some putting practice.

Lee6 had a very long eagle to win the tournament and fell a distance short but held her nerve to make birdie and set up a playoff.

Minutes later it was all over.

European Tour

Newport Wales — Nacho Elvira squandered a six-shot overnight lead in the Wales Open and bogeyed the 18th hole before rallying to beat Justin Harding in a playoff to win his first European Tour title on Sunday.

Elvira dedicated his victory to Spanish golfer Celia Barquin Arozamena who was murdered in 2018.

Harding three-putted the first extra hole the par-five 18th to gift victory to Elvira who had earlier made the same mistake when a closing par would have secured the title at Celtic Manor.

“I thought I had it all pretty much under control and to be honest I got pretty nervous on the last couple of putts on the regular 18(th)” Elvira told Sky Sports. “I was more calm in the playoff than I was on 18.”

Elvira finished the final round on a par 71 for a four-day total of 16-under 268.

Finland’s Mikko Korhonen (66) and South Africa's Harding (65) had both played their first 15 holes of the final round in 6-under par to share the lead on 16 under with Elvira falling a shot behind after covering his first 14 holes in 1 over.

The 34-year-old Spaniard then drove the green on the short par-four 15th to set up a straightforward birdie and holed from 20 feet for another on the 17th to retake the lead only to three-putt the last from 18 feet.

“To be honest I was thinking especially during the last nine or 10 holes about Celia Barquin she passed away a few years ago"" Elvira said. ""I was good friends with her family and this is for her.”

Barquin who won the European Ladies’ Amateur Championship in 2018 was a student at Iowa State University when she was found dead on a course in the state in September that year. Collin Richards pleaded guilty to first-degree murder and was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole in August 2019.

Korhonen finished a shot outside the playoff following a costly bogey on the 17th with England’s Callum Shinkwin another stroke back in fourth.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vb2lsY2l0eS5uZXdzL2dlbmVyYWwvMjAyMS8wNy8yNC9sZXRzLXlhay1hYm91dC1pdC13aHkteWFrcy1oYXZlLWJlY29tZS1zby1wb3B1bGFyLXBob3Rvcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Let's yak about it: why yaks have become so popular (PHOTOS),"CASPER Wyo. — Yaks are the talk of the town with all the fuss about a certain new yak farm. But why yaks? What is so special about them and are they really new to the Casper scene? Here at Oil City we heard the call and went looking for the answers. We went and talked to Casper Creek Yaks a local farm and got the scoop on the yaks. Carlice Cutright poses at Casper Creek Yaks with her female yak John Deere along with two trophies she won during the National Western Stock Show in Denver. (Dan Cepeda Oil City)

First what even is a yak? A yak is a long-haired species of cattle that is native to the Himalayan region of the Indian subcontinents. These beautiful domesticated cattle have the ability to withstand the biting cold winters as well as the hot summers making them the perfect fit for Wyoming’s arid and dynamic climate. Although they’re a type of cattle there is suggestion that they may be more closely related to bison than to other cattle. They can live to be 25-30 years old and they start breeding at just 2-3 years old. (Dan Cepeda Oil City)

Yaks have many benefits that are causing them to become an increasingly popular pick for ranchers. Yaks cause less damage to the environment than cattle. Yaks have nimble hooves that make them light on their feet keeping them from tearing up the grasslands as much. The do not need more than one or two acres of land. They eat less than cattle and require less work. These beasts of burden can be useful for everything. They supply a luxurious yarn from their long hair and produce milk. They are a greener healthier kind of meat as their meat is 97% naturally lean. They also make great pack animals. However the best part about them for the owners of Casper Creek Yaks is being able to show them off and love on them. Sonja Cutright leads John Deere out of the barn made from recycled shipping containers at Casper Creek Yaks. (Dan Cepeda Oil City)

Casper Creek Yaks is a premier show breeding business. They attend the Central Wyoming Fair and Rodeo state fair FFA showings and stock shows. They pride themselves on having all of their yaks halter trained by the time they leave their ranch. Carlice Cutright 20 poses with a baby yak at Casper Creek Yaks. (Dan Cepeda Oil City)

Casper Creek Yaks is run by Carlice Sonja and Mac Cutright. Carlice is the shower and manages everything. She is 20 years old and has been doing FFA and showing since she was little. They have been raising and showing yaks since 2015. Prairie Wind Yaks is the only other yak farm to predate them starting the previous year. Carlice Cutright leads John Deere through an outdoor pen at Casper Creek Yaks. (Dan Cepeda Oil City)

Casper Creek Yaks started with just 3 yaks and now they have 8 yaks with two on the way. They got into yaks because the cattle market was high and the original idea was to self-sustain. Yaks are often sought after because they do not require the owner to be involved in their process. However Carlice had a very different approach.

(Dan Cepeda Oil City)

The upkeep of the animals can be as minimal as letting them roam the field and providing food and water. For the Cutrights though it is a full-time commitment. In the winter they only tend to the yaks for an hour in the morning and evening but in the summer they will spend hours brushing them out getting them ready for shows feeding them and training them. (Dan Cepeda Oil City)

The main thing that makes their yaks so special is that people can touch them! Carlice says that “Whenever we go to shows we are the talk of the show.” Sonja continues this statement by saying it is because “we can have them out and people can love on them. A lot of people do not train them like we do.” Carlice Cutright poses with John Deere at Casper Creek Yaks. (Dan Cepeda Oil City)

The Cutright family has halter trained and imprinted with all the yaks. This process that can start when they are just a week old. First they want the yaks to be comfortable with humans touching them. Then they can start putting a halter on them and having them wear a halter for an hour a day and over time increasing the duration to several hours. The idea is to have the animal associate humans with good things. Creating this relationship with the yak allows owners to properly care for them and love on them as well. However training does not have to start at a young age. Even after they get older you can train them to be halter trained. According to yak expert Carlice she was able to train her steer who was already a year old in just a month. At Casper Creek the training is the most important part. It allows them to care for them and control them.

(Dan Cepeda Oil City)

One of their yaks named John Deere is a two-time grand supreme at the National Western Stock Show. However they have also won many other ribbons and awards for their other yaks including in livestock shows and FFA. There are all different kinds of shows they can do including pin shows fiber shows and halter shows. (Dan Cepeda Oil City)

Casper Creek Yaks just had a baby yak born on July 11. Miss Renly is just over a week old and already to prancing around on her own. She will stay with her mom until she is weaned off her at six to eight months.

The Cutrights can sell their yaks for $4/lb or as much as $10/lb with the yaks ranging anywhere from 500lbs to 1800lbs. In all this makes for a pretty good price. They are not as big as cattle but this is made up for with the lower required levels of food and maintenance.

(Dan Cepeda Oil City)

According to Sonja even though they just break even they are worth every penny — especially when they have calves. They do it more because they love the yaks rather than to make money. Sonja says that the most rewarding thing is having “animals with a tame side that you can educate people with.”

For Carlice working with yaks has given her the chance to be recognized. “I have won a lot and have a lot of accomplishments but those don’t matter to me. I love all my yaks the same and just having them go places and having them be able to be touched and educate people is my greatest achievement.”

It turns out that all the buzz about yaks is well deserved. These loveable and beautiful beasts have a definite place in our town and in our hearts.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9pZGFob3N0YXRlc21hbi9uYW1lL2FsbGVuLW5vYmxlLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTIwNjk4MDc00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Allen Noble Obituary (1928 - 2021) - Boise ID - Idaho Statesman,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/idahostatesman/name/allen-noble-obituary?id=20698074 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9pZGFob3N0YXRlc21hbi9uYW1lL2FsbGVuLW5vYmxlLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTIwNjk4MDc00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFncmlsYW5kLmllL2Zhcm1pbmctbmV3cy9qb2huLWRlZXJlLXByb3ZpZGUtcmVhbC10aW1lLXNpbGFnZS1hbmFseXNpcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,John Deere provides real time silage analysis via HarvestLab,"John Deere like all mainstream manufacturers is investing heavily in digital technology and proudly markets its electronic wares as being of great benefit to the farmer.

All the major companies will have a multitude of systems to aid not only the operation of the tractor in the field but also the handling of data generated by machinery and its management back in the farm office.

Despite all the hype the question still remains as to just how much of it is useful and how much of it actually gets used?

Contractor convinced of the benefits

In 2019. Michael Barrett dairy farmer and contractor of Newcastle West purchased a John Deere 8500i self propelled forage harvester form Geary’s Garage Co. Limerick.

One of the chief attractions being that it was fitted with the company’s HarvestLab 3000 nutrient sensor. Michael Barrett runs a contracting business alongside the family dairy farm

This device sits on the delivery chute and analyses the grass as it passes out of the chopping unit and into the trailer.

It is capable of measuring moisture dry matter protein starch neutral detergent fibre and sugar levels.

All these measurements are constant and are recorded in real time leading to a stream of data which can trace the silage quality back to not only the field but the general area within that field. The HarvestLab analysis unit is mounted towards the base of the chute

At this point it is worth noting that although the system is highly accurate the actual area the data can be pinned down to depends on the mowing and swathing operations that preceded the harvesting.

The larger the mower and/or rake then the larger the area any single piece of data refers to.

This will naturally reduce the potential accuracy of precision application of inputs. Crop conditions can vary enormously. Just 42% moisture was being recorded on this sheep paddock

Other than this drawback the potential benefits of having both an analysis of grass yield and quality in real time as well as being mapped for future reference are tremendous according to Michael who has become a keen advocate of data generation and analysis.

Immediate availability of information

Agriland visited Michael as he was clearing away some second cut silage at the Salesian Agricultural College in Co. Limerick.

It was during fine weather and the fields had been mown two days beforehand.

Watching the data from HarvestLab as it is displayed on the screen gives a fascinating insight into what is actually being harvested. A view that was not available up until the advent of this technology. The HarvestLab screen shows the nutrient analysis in real time as the harvester works through the crop

The screen displays the results in real time while simultaneously uploading them to the tractor company’s own cloud.

Michael may then access them in his own time via his ‘My John Deere’ account or share them directly with his customers.

John Deere helps plan ahead

Moisture content is obviously the major parameter and will dictate the need or otherwise for a silage additive.

On the day this varied between 82% and 41% in the fields being cut the former was silage ground while the latter was sheep paddocks. Knowing the quantity and quality of the grass at ensilage eliminates the need for later measurement and analysis

The amount of water being carried back to the pit will also be of interest but it is only one factor in projected silage quality and quantity.

The energy protein and fibre levels are just as important in determining the final feed value and the HarvestLab system can give an average for the whole crop not just the small sample that may be collected for analysis in the autumn.

Having access to both the quality and quantity of available silage several months earlier than normal can greatly help with planning winter feeding and stocking levels.

Not all grass is equal

There is apparently a huge variation in quality and quantity across the farms that Michael works on.

The college fields unsurprisingly are well up with the better ones but others may lack the desirable qualities recorded here. Thin pickings on a sheep paddock

The college grounds are treated uniformly and all receive much the same in the way of inputs.

However that is likely to change as the results of the HarvestLab and yield maps accumulate to give a clearer idea of what is happening in the field.

Exploring the advantages

John Flannery vice principle of the college is a keen advocate of the new information that is becoming available.

In addition to the ability to plan winter feeding well ahead of the season the college is now starting to vary its application rates for fertiliser according to yield.

Other management decisions such as reseeds will also be informed by the data.

A full GPS-guided soil analysis of the farm is taken every three years and he does not see this exercise being displaced.

It is more a matter of combining the two sets of information to better inform the management of the whole enterprise. The dairy fields were treated as one but yield variations point to the potential of varying inputs

The college is also satisfied with the accuracy of the HarvestLab unit having matched against its own near infra red (NIR) analytical tool and found it to give exactly the same results.

Bringing modern methods to students

Bringing the benefits of the latest technology to the attention of students is also an important aspect of its work.

Having a contractor equipped with such a demonstrably useful piece of digital technology helps get the message across.

While manufacturers broadcast the message that the new technology is here and will transform profitability overnight at farm level there is a slightly more cautious approach to adopting it. Bringing home the crop more efficiently grown

This is not to say it is unwelcome or undesirable… far from it; it is more a question of finding what is useful among all that is now on offer and gradually integrating it into the farm enterprise.

At Salesian Agricultural College we see a growing partnership between a forward thinking contractor and a client dedicated to exploring and exploiting the new technologies while passing on what it has found beneficial to the next generation of farmers.

This is perhaps the sort of connectivity which will prove to be more important than the actual devices and systems that enable it."

That’s one reason that online travel agencies used to be useful. When booking for someone else I wanted Expedia or Orbitz to do the ticketing. Then this wouldn’t be an issue.

Delta has been a stickler with this long after peers mostly stopped especially for trips originating in countries they view as ‘high fraud’. For last minute award tickets they’ve imposed in-person ticketing and even forbid last minute award booking from some countries.

Last minute tickets are more likely to be fraudulent. But last minute tickets are also likely to be business travelers or people on urgent business like attending a funeral.

A reader emailed me from the airport. He booked a last minute ticket on Delta using eCredits. Check-in was inhibited so he had to visit the ticket counter. There they insisted on seeing the credit card used for purchase. But no credit card was used for purchase. Because he paid with Delta’s own currency eCredits.

Normally that should be easily solved but Delta agents couldn’t get anyone at their help desk to answer and override this. I’ve written that telephone hold times for Delta’s diamond elites have been as much as 41 hours. It’s not shocking their internal staff can’t get help right away either.

Eventually two things happened

They told him if he didn’t pay for the ticket with a credit card then he needed to show the card saved in his account (not the card used to purchase the ticket since there was one). That doesn’t seem right and he didn’t have it with him in any case.

(not the card used to purchase the ticket since there was one). That doesn’t seem right and he didn’t have it with him in any case. They exchanged his ticket for a new ticket purchased on the spot for $220 more. They wouldn’t let him check in with the ticket he’d purchased earlier but could verify a credit card he physically had with him and wouldn’t honor the old price.

A weather delay meant that he made the flight and now he’s out $220 all because Delta insisted on seeing the credit card used to purchase a ticket that wasn’t purchased with a credit card.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvYmVzdC13b3JzdC1haXJsaW5lcy10cmF2ZWwtYW5hbHlzaXMtMjAyMdIBUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvYmVzdC13b3JzdC1haXJsaW5lcy10cmF2ZWwtYW5hbHlzaXMtMjAyMS5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This airline holds top spot for third year in a row,"2020 was a brutal year for the airline industry but leisure travel has roared back and airlines are finally starting to recover.

According to The Points Guy’s Best Airlines analysis Delta Air Lines yet again keeps the top spot for best overall experience for flyers for the third year in a row.

AIRLINES ARE REBOUNDING EVEN AS PRICES SURGE: ADOBE

""Once again Delta Air Lines rose to the top of TPG’s Best Airlines analysis"" says Nick Ewen Senior Editor at The Points Guy. ""The data showed that the carrier offers consistent high-quality performance — from its reliability to the in-flight experience to its SkyMiles loyalty program. As the travel industry continues to bounce back from the coronavirus pandemic Delta is well-positioned to capitalize on the rebound.""

Following Delta was Southwest Airlines which came in second place. Allegiant Air on the other hand ranked as the worst airline.

Delta didn’t necessarily stand out in any single category but its consistency across all objectives is what allowed it to keep the top spot versus the other airlines.

The carrier ranked number one in both reliability and travel experience which are two key indicators in judging airline quality. Its frequent flyer program also held good standing ranking second place overall.

Customer service was also included where Delta was part of a four-way tie for runner-up with fewer than 10 complaints per 100000 passengers.

Additionally Delta tied for the top spot for lounge access with Alaska Airlines and tied with Allegiant and Hawaiian for zero involuntary bumps during the 12th-month period.

Southwest Airlines which came in second place overall ranked number one in customer service with an average of just over three complaints per 100000 passengers. It also took the top spot in baggage and change fees which were about .31 cents per passenger and award availability where it offered the most availability at the best value compared to the other airlines’ programs.

But with nearly 49% of the country fully vaccinated travel is making a big comeback — even with the fast-spreading delta variant.

If you're ready to travel The Points Guy (TPG) has released its annual report on the best U.S. airlines for 2021.

To determine the list the website ranked each airline in four categories using data from the Department of Transportation. Those factors include reliability (including timeliness cancellations and baggage); experience (cabin features lounges and customer complaints); cost (including bag and change fees) and loyalty (frequent flyer usage and award availability).

For the third straight year in a row TPG ranked Delta Air Lines No. 1 according to the report.

""The carrier wasn't a standout in any single category — it was fifth for mishandled baggage and fourth for customer complaints submitted to the DOT for example"" the report said. ""However Delta only hit the bottom spot in a single element (affordability) otherwise maintaining solid scores across the remaining data-backed criteria we analyzed. This consistency helped push it to the top spot.""

Here are the 10 best U.S. airlines according to TPG's report and their highest and lowest performing areas:

1. Delta Air Lines

Top-performing areas: involuntary bumps from flights lounges

Lowest-performing areas: affordability

2. Southwest Airlines

Top-performing areas: customer satisfaction bag/change fees award availability

Lowest-performing areas: lounges

(A Southwest spokesperson says it's honored to make the list during one of the toughest years in the airline's history and credits the Southwest employees for its success.)

3. United Airlines

Top-performing areas: route network frequent flyer

Lowest-performing areas: affordability

4. Alaska Airlines

Top-performing areas: lounges

Lowest-performing areas: bag/change fees

5. American Airlines

Top-performing areas: family route network

Lowest-performing areas: baggage

6. JetBlue Airways

Top-performing areas: cabin features award availability

Lowest-performing areas: bag change fees

7. Hawaiian Airlines

Top-performing areas: timeliness involuntary bumps

Lowest-performing areas: customer satisfaction route network

8. Spirit Airlines

Top-performing areas: cancellations affordability

Lowest-performing areas: wheelchairs scooters bag/change fees

(A spokesperson for Spirit says it's pleased to make the list and is ""looking forward to climbing higher in the years to come.""

9. Frontier

Top-performing areas: cancellations affordability

Lowest-performing areas: involuntary bumps bag/change fees award availability

10. Allegiant Airlines

Top-performing areas: Involuntary bumps baggage wheelchairs/scooters

Lowest-performing areas: timeliness cancellations family frequent flyer

When contacted for comment on ranking weak spots a spokesperson for Delta said the airline is putting customers first. A United spokesperson said the company is focused on continuing to improve customer experience. Allegiant Frontier Hawaiian Airlines JetBlue and American Airlines did not immediately respond to CNBC Make It's request to comment. A spokesperson for Alaska Airlines declined to comment.

It turns out I was only 50 Rapid Rewards points short of booking a flight that would've cost upwards of $400 roundtrip in cash.

So close! Otherwise the trip was perfectly planned and I was about to cancel it over a flight I was only a few points away from being able to book for free.

I was just short of points on my award booking to Florida. (Screenshot courtesy of Southwest Airlines)

But I found a solution: Surveys. I signed up for Southwest's Rewards for Opinions and after taking two surveys I earned enough Rapid Rewards points to save my trip.

Southwest isn't the only airline that lets you do this: various other major airlines and hotel chains let you do these types of surveys so you likely can get points and miles for your preferred loyalty program through surveys.

Let's dive in and investigate more about surveys for points and miles.

Overview

Here's how surveys for points and miles work: companies ask your thoughts on various subjects and you get rewarded a fixed amount of points or miles after each survey.

Once you complete a survey your answers then get pooled with the answers of others and as a result businesses are able to see the general attitudes of people toward their products and policies.

Surveys for points and miles can be about anything: I have taken surveys on topics ranging from cars to electronics to delivery services. Each survey generally takes 10 to 30 minutes to complete which doesn't seem long — but this time can easily add up.

A few example surveys that I was offered to take for Alaska Mileage Plan miles. (Screenshot courtesy of The Opinion Terminal)

Here are some of the major airlines and hotel chains that offer surveys with the links to their respective survey websites:

Notably Delta Air Lines does not offer surveys for miles.

Many companies on this list also have partnerships with e-Rewards -- another survey site that allows you to transfer points and miles to various partners.

And chances are you likely have some points or miles for at least one of the airline or hotel programs above. Surveys could help you turn those points or miles into a reward booking. Although each survey takes some time to complete the time investment could be worth it in certain situations.

When are surveys for points and miles worth the time?

Here are three situations where surveys have proven to be especially helpful:

When you need a small sum of miles. I have personally found surveys quite useful when I am a few miles short of an award ticket such as in my earlier Southwest example.

Another example is when I was booking a United flight from Savannah Georgia (SAV) to Chicago O'Hare (ORD) earlier this year. The award ticket cost 5500 miles — but I only had about 5200 miles.

Taking surveys for miles helped me get enough miles to fly to Chicago. (Photo by Jacob Harrison/The Points Guy)

Again I was initially deflated that I was so close to an award ticket but couldn't book it — after all I'm a college student on a tight budget who would love to avoid spending money on a plane ticket. I don't own a United credit card and was not planning to earn miles before booking so there were seemingly no other ways to get the 300 miles I needed for the award.

But then I remembered that I could take a survey or two to reach my mileage goal so I signed up for Opinion Miles Club. It was my first time taking a survey for United miles so in addition to earning 50 miles for completing a survey I also earned a 300-mile sign-up bonus. This one survey alone with the sign-up bonus gave me enough miles to book the flight so I avoided having to pay for a revenue ticket.

When miles are about to expire. Each time miles from surveys are posted to your account they prevent your existing miles from expiring. This makes surveys a great non-credit card option to keep your existing points and miles — and to earn a few more too. Surveys are especially helpful if you have thousands of miles that you don't want to expire but don't have any near-term travel plans or the proper credit card.

Related: How to keep your points and miles from expiring

To take advantage of a sign-up bonus. Taking a survey to receive the sign-up bonus could be worth it especially if you're a few hundred points or miles away from an award booking.

Keep an eye out for promotions: Hilton recently offered 10000 HHonors points as a sign-up bonus for completing your first survey but this deal has since been dramatically lowered to 1250 HHonors points.

Sign-up bonuses for survey websites can be quite lucrative; I took advantage of the now-expired Guest Opinion Rewards offer that gave me 10000 HHonors points. (Screenshot courtesy of Hilton)

Here is a list of the current sign-up bonuses offered for various airline and hotel loyalty programs:

Should you spend your free time taking surveys for points and miles?

A common perception is that taking surveys for points and miles for long periods of time is not worth doing because of low mileage accrual after long surveys — but is this really the case?

To give that a closer look I took surveys for two hours with The Opinion Terminal — Alaska's survey partner — to see how many Mileage Plan miles I would receive. I chose the shortest surveys with the highest payouts to maximize my gains.

I ended up earning 391 Mileage Plan miles in the two hours of taking surveys — or 195.5 miles per hour. Based on TPG's latest valuations of the Mileage Plan program this is a mere $3.52 per hour worth of Alaska miles.

This was my first time doing a survey for Alaska so I also received a 400-mile sign-up bonus — worth about $7.20. However my total earnings including the sign-up bonus were still only 791 miles — or $14.24 worth of Mileage Plan miles — in the two hours of survey-taking.

Here are all of the Mileage Plan miles I earned in two hours. (Screenshot courtesy of The Opinion Terminal)

To get enough miles for the cheapest award ticket on Alaska which costs 5000 miles I would have to spend about another 17 hours doing surveys at the rate I was going — something I'm not willing to do.

As you can see it is likely not worth it to take these surveys for long periods of time. However if you enjoy taking surveys or are only a few hundred points or miles away from an award these surveys can be a great way for you to inch closer to your next award booking.

Things to consider when completing surveys for points and miles

Points and miles from surveys might not post instantly. Although I frequently receive points and miles almost immediately after finishing a survey the fine print says that it could take up to six weeks for miles to post.

For my Alaska Airlines example the miles were posted almost instantly to my Mileage Plan account after completing each survey; however when I took my first Hilton survey the HHonors points didn't post for a few weeks.

You will be bombarded with emails. I receive one to two emails per day from Opinion Miles Club alone offering me to take surveys; these frequent emails can be bothersome. And if you unsubscribe from the emails your account will be deactivated.

I unsubscribed from the Rewards for Opinions emails and inadvertently deactivated my account. (Screenshot Courtesy of Rewards for Opinions)

One workaround to the frequent emails is that you can automatically send the survey emails to a certain inbox that is separate from your main inbox. You could also give a secondary email when signing up on the survey website.

You might not qualify for every survey. When I was taking surveys for my Alaska Airlines example I was excited at an offer to take a 20-minute survey for 733 Mileage Plan miles — worth more than $13.

However as soon as I began the survey it abruptly ended. It turns out I was not eligible to complete the survey. As a result my 733 miles turned into a mere five miles — the sum given by The Opinion Terminal when you are deemed ineligible for a survey you already started.

So take note that you will not always qualify for every survey — and that can be a letdown when the mileage yield is high.

Bottom line

Although spending long periods of time taking these surveys is not always worth it they can be a great supplemental tool in earning enough miles for your next award trip — especially if you are only a few miles away from an award.

Editor's note: This post has been updated with additional information about airlines that offer surveys.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRhbXBhYmF5LmNvbS9uZXdzL3RyYW5zcG9ydGF0aW9uLzIwMjEvMDcvMjQvd2hlbi1haXJsaW5lLXBhc3NlbmdlcnMtYmVoYXZlLWJhZGx5LXRoZXktcmFyZWx5LWZhY2UtcHJvc2VjdXRpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,When airline passengers behave badly they rarely face prosecution,"The passenger on the Alaska Airlines flight repeatedly dialed 911 before it even left the gate in Seattle. He claimed the plane was being hijacked. Then he called the FBI to say there was a bomb.

Police stormed the plane and evacuated everyone before discovering it was a hoax. The false report delayed the Jan. 23 flight for hours forced the rescreening of baggage and may have broken a federal law that could land the passenger in prison for five years.

But so far no charges have been filed.

That may be because misconduct on airliners — which in the past year includes everything from passengers who refuse to wear face masks to others who assault flight attendants — is governed by a patchwork of federal state and local agencies that aren’t always well equipped to prosecute such cases.

“It is a problem” said Loretta Alkalay the former FAA eastern regional counsel and an adjunct professor at Vaughn College of Aeronautics & Technology. “The state police usually don’t have jurisdiction. Once it’s in flight that’s the fed’s jurisdiction and the U.S. attorneys are overwhelmed by more serious cases.”

More than 3500 reports of unruly passengers on flights have been logged this year by the Federal Aviation Administration far exceeding anything the agency has seen in the past. Of those 581 were deemed serious enough to prompt a formal investigation the FAA said.

But the agency — which has a primary mission of ensuring air safety not security — has no authority to bring criminal charges. Since December it has announced 46 civil penalty cases.

The government is straining to keep up.

The Seattle case for example is being handled by the King County Prosecuting Attorney’s Office which declined to bring felony threat charges because there was no actual hijacking or bomb spokesman Casey McNerthney said. Prosecutors are considering whether to charge the man with false reporting but it’s only a misdemeanor under state law.

Federal law makes it a serious crime to falsely report a hijacking. But the U.S. Attorney’s office in Seattle hasn’t brought charges and it doesn’t appear the case was referred to it.

For now the 32-year-old Oregon man faces a possible fine of $10500 from the FAA. Such fines are subject to challenge and negotiation.

A Bloomberg News review of FAA cases court records and news reports found several instances of serious cases in which passengers allegedly struck flight crew members or engaged in other criminal acts but no charges were filed.

“If it’s a criminal activity it ought to have criminal prosecution” Southwest Airlines Co. Chief Executive Officer Gary Kelly said on a conference call Thursday. “There are extreme cases out there that are occurring and I think that we will be for the full enforcement and letter of the law whatever is available. We would be in support of that.”

FAA Administrator Steve Dickson ordered stricter enforcement after numerous cases of fights and other incidents on planes erupted around the time of the Jan. 6 storming of the U.S. Capitol.

Since then many incidents have become intertwined with the divisive politics over the COVID-19 pandemic. More than 2600 unruly passenger reports or 74% of the total in 2021 have involved the refusal to wear mandatory face masks according to the agency.

“The system was not designed to deal with air rage incidents because they were always few and far between” said Jeffrey Price an airport security consultant and professor at Metropolitan State University of Denver.

It’s a difficult situation for all involved and building a solid case takes time and resources Alkalay the former FAA regional counsel said. Airport police forces may not always provide the proper information FAA lawyers or federal prosecutors need to build cases. Similarly information from flight crews is often incomplete she said.

A group of airline associations and industry unions last month urged Attorney General Merrick Garland to “send a strong and consistent message” by more aggressively bringing criminal cases in the worst cases.

“Flight attendants continue to encounter unprecedented levels of air rage and passenger misconduct” Julie Hedrick president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants union at American Airlines Group Inc. said in an emailed statement. “Where criminal charges apply the federal government should prosecute offenders to the fullest extent.”

In a statement the Justice Department said prosecutors consider a range of factors before bringing charges. They include the severity of the offense and whether lives were endangered the impacts on victims and the mental health status of the person who committed the act.

“Interference with flight crew members is a serious crime that deserves the attention of federal law enforcement” the department said in the statement.

Federal charges were filed in 16 cases in the year ending Oct. 1 2020 and 20 in the year before.

Bringing more criminal cases might help slow the explosion of cases but historically it has proven difficult to win convictions on such cases and to get federal prosecutors to devote resources to the issue said J.E. Murdock who served as FAA’s chief counsel and acting deputy administrator in the 1980s. One avenue might be a kind of public shaming in which the government releases the names of people involved in such incidents he said.

A similar idea floated by flight attendant unions is to add the names of those involved in unruly incidents to the government’s no-fly list. Airlines say they’ve added hundreds of people to internal lists this year prohibiting them from buying tickets following incidents on flights but they don’t share the names with competitors.

Federal legislation to increase penalties and to give local law enforcement more authority over the cases might also help Alkalay said.

There are recent signs of a willingness to prosecute. A dozen people have been charged with interfering with a flight crew this year through July 15 according to federal court records.

Among them: an off-duty Delta Air Lines Inc. flight attendant who caused a disturbance on one of his employer’s flights on June 11 and had to be restrained faces federal charges of interfering with a flight crew which carries a prison term as long as 20 years.

Some additional criminal cases also may be pending. “There are a number of cases where investigations are ongoing and the evidence is still being reviewed for possible charges” said Emily Langlie a spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney’s office in Seattle.

She declined to comment on specific cases but one possibility involves a Honolulu-to-Seattle flight that prompted the largest proposed penalty announced by the FAA this year.

A man on the Delta plane had to be restrained in handcuffs after trying to break into the cockpit and striking a flight attendant in the face the FAA said. He later freed one arm from the restraints and hit the flight attendant again the agency alleged. The FAA is seeking a fine of $52500.

Then there is the woman on a JetBlue Airways Corp. flight from Miami to Los Angeles who yelled at a flight attendant and slammed into his body almost knocking him into a lavatory according to the FAA. She was removed from the plane after it diverted to Austin Texas.

The U.S. Attorney’s office in the Western District of Texas doesn’t have a case on the incident spokeswoman Lora Makowski said in an email. The FAA has proposed a $15000 fine against the passenger."

The company announced numerous features that plan on making it to your Apple Watch with watchOS 8.

watch OS 8 Bluetooth Health device discovery

Among these watchOS 8 features is a less talked about feature in the Bluetooth settings section. Apple has now included a new ‘Health Devices’ feature in the Bluetooth settings. The central idea behind this new feature is to allow health devices to connect with your Apple Watch directly.

Currently most devices that you connect with your Apple Watch require you to use your iPhone. This new feature bypasses that step and allows for automatic discovery and connection of health devices.

Although Apple did not get into the details around this new feature during the WWDC event the implications of this change could be huge.

watchOS 7 Bluetooth vs. watch OS 8 Bluetooth connection

The core Bluetooth feature on watchOS 7 today allows for Bluetooth connection when the app is in the foreground or during a background session. This works well when a person wants to focus on an app to get information from its accessory.

However with watchOS 7 you cannot have a complication with information from an accessory. This complication is not updated with new data until users open up the app on their Apple Watch.

Some app makers such as Sugarmate have designed a clever way around this by taking advantage of the calendar complication on the Apple Watch.

Thankfully with watchOS 8 new changes device makers can design their apps to connect their Bluetooth accessory using background app refresh. This will now enable accessory makers to update their app complications with information from their accessories.

watchOS 8 uses a Bluetooth LE (low energy) connection to communicate with the accessory.

Potential for Dexcom G7 and Apple Watch direct pairing?

For starters take a look at the popular Dexcom app used by many to monitor their Blood Glucose measurements. Currently once you attach the glucose sensor to your body the embedded transmitter on the sensor communicates with your iPhone using Bluetooth.

Users then use the Dexcom app on their Apple Watch to monitor the blood glucose readings that are piped in from their iPhones.

This could easily change in the future with the new ‘Health device’ discoverability feature in watchOS 8’s Bluetooth settings.

The new Dexcom G7 transmitter and receiver are now powered with Bluetooth 5.2 / 5.1 instead of the older Bluetooth 4.0 / 4.2 that was common in the G6 platform.

If the new Dexcom G7 could communicate directly with your Apple Watch this would be a huge relief for many diabetes users who may not be required to carry their iPhone with them when they are out and about on a short walk or a bike ride.

The same holds for other Health devices that can directly communicate with the Apple Watch. You will no longer be required to carry your iPhone all the time.

Apple and Dexcom have worked together in the past and the Dexcom experience on Apple products is considered much better than the Android experience by many users.

We reached out to Dexcom for comments but did not hear any confirmation around how the company plans to take advantage of this new Apple Watch feature.

In Summary

This feature is new and health accessory makers will also need to account for power-related issues since the accessory will now draw on more power to support direct integration with the Apple Watch.

We may hear more about this when Apple unveils its Apple Watch Series 7 in the fall. The new Health Device Bluetooth feature is supported on older Apple Watch models. Given that this feature is pretty new we look forward to seeing if Apple announces any key health device makers that plan on offering this feature in their updated apps.",,,,,,,,,,,,

In a filing with the US District Court for the District of Columbia the agency asked for a three-week extension or until Aug. 19 to amend a lawsuit that the court dismissed last month. The FTC said in its request that it had reached an agreement with Facebook over the proposed extension.

Last month Judge James E. Boasberg of the federal court knocked down a core argument made by the FTC saying prosecutors had failed to provide enough persuasive facts to back up the claim — that Facebook holds a monopoly over social networking. But the judge gave the FTC a 30-day window to refile its lawsuit.

The new lawsuit will be the first major action by Lina Khan the new chair of the FTC and a critic of Facebook Google and Amazon who has advocated for the breakup of the digital platforms.

Industry veteran Wong Ka Vin leads Data Center First as co-founder and chief executive of the venture which represents Gaw’s first investment in its Asian data centre platform outside of China the private equity firm said in a release.

In addition to the maiden project at Nongsa Digital Park in Batam roughly 30 kilometres (18.6 miles) across the Singapore Strait from the Lion City Gaw will work with Data Center First to originate evaluate and develop projects in Southeast Asia and beyond.

“I am excited to be working with Ka Vin and his team of professionals in creating this data centre operating platform” said president and managing principal Kenneth Gaw. “It signals a key milestone in Gaw Capital Partners’ growth in the data centre industry an industry that enables digital transformation opportunities for organisations globally to continue to grow.”

Southeast Asian Expertise

Gaw plans to increase its regional data centre footprint rapidly through a combination of multiple asset and platform acquisitions a strategy given a boost earlier this month when the firm brought aboard former Keppel Data Centres executive Kok-Chye Ong as managing director and head of internet data centres ex-China.

To maintain that momentum the family run outfit has now tapped Wong whose track record includes building data centre platforms at US giant Equinix Malaysia’s CSF Asia and the 1-Net unit of Singapore’s Mediacorp. While at 1-Net Wong led the construction in Singapore’s Woodlands area of 1-Net North a 30MVA facility which was acquired by Keppel DC REIT in 2019 for S$200.2 million (now $147.2 million).

A computer science graduate of Sheffield Hallam University Wong spent his early career as a marketing director in the telecom division of HP and as senior vice president for business development at ST Telemedia in Singapore.

Batam’s Bit Barn Hotspot

The Straits Times reported last month that 20 data centre operators were considering the possibility of setting up shop at Nongsa Digital Park with at least one sealing the deal after President Joko Widodo designated the campus a special economic zone.

The story identified Data Center First’s Wong as the buyer of 2.75 hectares (6.8 acres) of land at the park to build multiple facilities customised for clients such as banks telecom firms and e-commerce businesses.

Some 25 hectares at the park has been set aside for data centre development in the first phase with room for expansion. Operators told the Straits Times that Batam is attractive because it is relatively sheltered from natural disasters geographically close to Singapore and part of a market of 270 million people.

Building Into a Boom

Gaw’s launch of an APAC data centre platform comes less than two years after the private equity shop announced its entry into the sector in China.

In 2019 Gaw and Beijing-based Centrin Data set up a joint venture that formed the basis for the firm’s first data centre investment fund targeting hyperscale facilities in China. The fund was seeded with a 6400-rack facility built by Centrin in Kunshan a city just outside Shanghai in China’s Jiangsu province.

Last September Gaw announced a $1.3 billion closing for the fund revealing that the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority was the largest backer of the vehicle among several global institutional investors said to have contributed. Gaw planned to use the fresh funding to invest in a portfolio of server facilities in China.

The data centre market in Asia Pacific is predicted to experience a compound annual growth rate of 12.9 percent from 2020 through 2027 when it is expected to reach $59.8 billion in value according to a report last month by Renub Research.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlYWxlc3RhdGUuY29tLmF1L25ld3MvcmVhbC1lc3RhdGUtY2FuLXZpcmFsLXByb3BlcnR5LXZpZGVvcy1oZWxwLXNlbGwteW91ci1ob21lL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Real estate: Can viral property videos help sell your home? - realestate.com.au,"Videos made to go viral and a social media presence have become part of the modern real estate agent’s arsenal.

“There’s an inherent risk in what appeals to the humour of one person can land flat or offend another” he said. “It’s important the vendor and agent have a shared strategy that can include if they wish something humorous as it could be higher risk and higher reward.

“But relying on a viral strategy is akin to putting everything on black in a roulette table. Serious sellers need to focus on getting the basics right including solid investment in the portals (like realestate.com.au) and in digital display advertising and a solid open-for-inspection strategy.”

This didn’t mean steering clear of social media – in fact it was one of the key pillars of the increasingly popular method of digital display advertising Mr Watts said.

The others were using platforms like the Google-owned Doubleclick to “advertise on a wide variety of websites” and incorporating search-friendly words into listings.

“Digital display advertising allows the agent to get increasingly granular and sophisticated in targeting ads to the right buyer” he said.

“I’ve seen a series of suppliers turning those three digital channels into bundles so vendors can have a turnkey solution.”

Print advertising enhanced this especially for high-end listings as buyers tended to “associate print with premium pricing” he said.

Advantage Property Consulting director Frank Valentic agreed the best way to sell remained a “standard four-week marketing campaign” aimed at legitimate buyers.

“Viral videos can be good for getting a bit more promotion for the property. But a lot of the people (seeing them) won’t be qualified buyers” he said.

“If you’re not doing that four-week campaign – with inspections and advertising online in print and on a ‘for sale’ board – you might be missing out on a better offer.”

For Collings Real Estate director Christian Gravias vying to go viral was all about “amplifying views on properties”.

“We don’t disregard traditional methods” he said. “But we’re also using every social media platform possible to get as much attention on a property as possible.”

CAN ONLINE ATTENTION LEAD TO SALES?

Organic social media activity has proven effective at boosting listings profiles – and even at leading to sales in some cases. But it remains an “experiment” according to Mr Gravias who noted it was “hard to gauge” which posts and videos would “explode”.

But he has had success boosting his agency’s profile by injecting his love of cinema into property promotional videos.

The firm has parodied James Bond Home Alone American Psycho and Joker to sell homes across Melbourne racking up tens of thousands of views online.

Collings also replicated a viral TikTok video featuring a cranberry juice-drinking skateboarder and Fleetwood Mac song Dreams in December which helped a Prahran apartment sell in only six days.

Mr Gravias said his agency made these to share across all the major social media platforms on top of creating more traditional videos for sites like realestate.com.au.

Not all of Collings’ videos are as cinematic – Mr Gravias said his team had also started “experimenting with Snapchat and TikTok”.

A basic video walk-through of a unit in Reservoir posted on the latter lured a buyer at the top of the $520000-$570000 range this month.

“We got an inquiry through our website from someone who said ‘we saw the property on TikTok’” Mr Gravias said. “And they purchased it.”

In 2019 a western Sydney property also sold for $1.73m to a 23-year-old first-home buyer who saw a raunchy marketing video (pictured below inset) that went viral online.

The clip of a man and woman dancing around the Padstow house generated more than 1000 inspections.

“The price is more than we expected so it looks like the video worked a charm” LJ Hooker Bankstown agent Sam Nader said at the time.

“In real estate it is all about getting people to see the product.”

IS ALL PUBLICITY GOOD PUBLICITY?

Even if a video or social media post did go viral it wasn’t guaranteed to attract the right attention Hodges Sandringham director Angus Graham said.

“I do believe people are reading the copy writing (on listings) less and less” he said.

“And you see some great videos about the lifestyle aspect of a property – I’ve done things like walking to a train station or shooting a hoop in a park that’s four doors up.

“But some agents are taking it too far and it’s almost a little cringe-worthy.”

A new Instagram account Lords of Property has amassed more than 27500 followers – and irritated some agents – by poking fun at out-there real estate activity on social media.

Its creator told the Herald Sun the aim was to “showcase the lengths some of these agents go to sell property which can be funny”.

Mr Gravias said when he and a few of his colleagues had been featured he took an “all publicity is good publicity” approach. But he doubted all agents would think this way.

“I do worry about the mental state of agents who are giving it a go … and they’re belittled online” he said. “I hope it doesn’t turn them off creating content.”

He said while the purpose of creating social media content was not to boost his or his agency’s profile it was a happy by-product.

“We never go in with the intention of it being about ourselves but it’s great getting exposure” he said. “The aim is to sell the property and find people who never would have seen a property if we didn’t use this method.”

Mr Valentic doubted viral videos led to properties selling “for a lot more” noting: “If an agent is bragging they’ve sold a property on social media in four hours I would wonder have they actually got the highest price?”

With restrictions and lockdown protocols implemented across the globe to mitigate the spread of the virus the world was forced to reassess the way we go about our day-to-day lives and the way we do business. As borders closed and tourism came to a standstill many companies went digital and the Sotheby’s International Realty brand was no exception.

“With a long-standing commitment to innovation the brand swiftly implemented new ways of conducting business while utilising already pioneering technology to navigate the extraordinary conditions we all faced” Michael Zammit joint owner and director of Malta Sotheby’s International Realty says.

“As a leader in luxury property we were able to anticipate the change in consumer demands and adapt how we conduct business to suit the evolving trends in the property market.”

Following the international brands lead Malta Sotheby’s International Realty launched a new more user-friendly website implemented state-of-the-art CRM technology and began to digitally cater to their prestigious clientele.

“The measures put in place in 2020 continued to provide us with great results. The first two quarters of 2021 have not only shown phenomenal growth for Malta Sotheby’s International Realty locally but the Sotheby’s International Realty brand as a whole across the EMEIA region (Europe Middle East India & Africa)” Zammit explains.

The region has seen an increase of 65 per cent in sales compared to the same time last year with January and April being record months for the brand. This can be attributed to the innovative steps the brand has taken to ensure a continued excellent service along with the increased consumer optimism and confidence with vaccine rollouts taking place worldwide.

“A number of Sotheby’s International Realty Affiliate Offices are on track to achieving record-breaking years with Malta Sotheby’s International Realty being no exception. The demand for luxury property in Malta has increased so exponentially that we have had to expand and take on more experienced sales associates to continue delivering the white-glove service our clients expect” Zammit continues.

He goes on to explain that the reach and range of the Sotheby’s International brand is evident with international sales up by 50 per cent including the CALA (Caribbean Latin America) & APAC (Asia Pacific) regions.

“Sotheby’s International Realty truly is a global brand with a global reach. Our international footprint reaches across 74 countries and territories with more than 1000 offices worldwide and that number keeps growing as three more offices are set to open in Kuwait Oman and Morocco.”

The brand’s global presence paves the way for an international referral network like no other with cross border referrals in the EMEIA Region totalling US$25 million in the first two quarters of 2021 alone.

“We are now more committed than ever to ensuring the continued excellent service expected by our clientele. We understand that our role is more than just that of an agent but also as your partner in finding a home that suits your vision for the future” Zammit concludes.

On Friday the S&P 500 index crossed the 4400-mark for the first time while the Dow Jones Industrial Average moved past 35000 and reached a new high. Meanwhile weekly jobless claims increased unexpectedly to around 419000 dampening hopes of labor market recovery.

Continuing its buyout spree Accenture bought two technology companies early this week — Toronto-based Oracle cloud service provider Cloudworks and workforce optimization consultancy Workforce Insight – and completed the previously announced acquisition of France-based cybersecurity firm Openminded.

In another tech deal Microsoft agreed to acquire security start-up CloudKnox. Meanwhile Visa clinched a deal to buy Currencycloud for about 700 million pounds.

The airline industry dominated the earnings scene this week with United Airlines reporting results on Tuesday and Southwest Airlines and American Airlines releasing their second-quarter statements on Thursday. Earlier IBM came out with positive numbers for its most recent quarter on Monday. The next day all eyes were on streaming giant Netflix which published mixed results in the after-hours.

Energy firm Kinder Morgan Seagate Technology Verizon soft drink major Coca-Cola and Johnson & Johnson stole the show on Wednesday. Thursday was as busy as usual with the major events being the second-quarter earnings releases of telecom firm AT&T fast-food chain Domino’s Pizza Biogen Abbott Laboratories Intel as well as social networking platforms Twitter and Snap. Schlumberger American Express and Kimberly-Clark reported Friday before the opening bell.

While Lockheed Martin is probably the only major company to report earnings on July 26 the market will be closely following the report of Alphabet on July 27. The Google parent will be joined by gadget giant Apple chipmaker AMD Starbucks and Microsoft in the after-hours. Before the opening bell aviation firm JetBlue and engineering behemoth General Electric are scheduled to report earnings.

The financial releases of Bristol-Myers Squibb aircraft builder Boeing and Ford Motor are the key events slated for July 28. The next day is going to be as hectic when the earnings announcements of e-commerce giant Amazon.com Altria Group Yum! Brands and Merck & Co. are on tap. Procter & Gamble oil giant ExxonMobil and Caterpillar are among the major companies preparing to report on July 30.

The drive to reach a small “gift” — a free latte a seat upgrade on a flight — is why businesses offer rewards programs in the first place. Luring people into coming back repeatedly means a company can bank on returning customers and we like those tiny achievements. “We are often trying to reach goals. And if they’re complementary to what we carry out in day to day life they become attainable” says Vijay Viswanathan a marketing researcher at Northwestern University. At least that’s the classic philosophy behind our love of loyalty programs. But over the years it’s become clear that we like rewards not just because of the gifts themselves but because of who gets to see us receive them.

Eyes On the Prize

Companies have an ideal customer in mind: It’s the person who repeatedly buys items with a high profit margin Viswanathan says. Rewards programs do the work of locking in the “repeat” part of the perfect shopper. It’s less expensive to have buyers that come back than it is to recruit and tempt new ones Viswanathan says and helps businesses build an idea of what future revenue will look like when there’s a stable of returning shoppers.

How the program tempts you depends on how easy it is to switch to competing services says Mark Vandenbosch a retired marketing researcher at Western University in Canada. For example bouncing around between gas station companies is as simple as pulling into a different parking lot on your way home. To convince you to seek out their brand every time you drive gas stations offer programs that try to build a habit — small rewards offered regularly. Credit card companies however are slightly harder to go between. “Once I choose one over the other I’m a little invested” Vandenbosch says. Switching banking information can be a pain. Rewards programs offer huge incentives during the first few months convincing people to stick it out and reach the phase where leaving the card sounds like a hassle.

In either situation the rewards are achievable — and we respond just the way companies want us to. Since the 1930s behavior researchers have discussed the observation that the closer an animal (or a human) is to a reward the harder or faster we work to reach it. And in 2006 marketing researchers from Columbia and Fordham Universities in New York put the idea to the test with loyalty programs.

The team gave study participants in a cafe with rewards cards and tracked how long it took shoppers to get all ten punches for a free coffee as well as how much time passed between each visit. After each punch the time it took for the customer to come back and get another one dropped. Overall shoppers filled their card 16 percent faster than they would have if the gap between each coffee was as long as it was between the first and second cups.

Even the illusion of progress on the “free coffee” goal had people return faster. In one set up the researchers posed as employees and gave shoppers one of two kinds of rewards cards: One that was empty with 10 spaces to fill or one with 12 total spaces where two were already punched. Each group had to get 10 punches for their reward. But those with the two already completed finished the card in just under 13 days while those with the empty 10-punch card filled it in nearly 16.

Suckers for Status

That potential rewards make us buy more — and faster — has become a classic rationale for businesses starting loyalty programs. And in his research Viswanathan has found the systems particularly those with different tiers of membership have another attraction. “Social comparisons become a pretty important driver for people to join loyalty programs” Viswanathan says. People pursue soft rewards which are things without financial benefit like a so-called “platinum status” or priority treatment because it makes them feel special or because other people see them being treated differently.

And brands want those high-spending customers to show off the perks. “​​Why would I give a high lifetime value customer the status? So that they can talk about the program” Viswanathan says. As friends coworkers and family see someone get special treatment they too are tempted to join the rewards system and get the same status — a result companies are looking for. Someone with the time funds and dedication to rise through loyalty ranks probably knows other people who would behave similarly and are people the company wants as customers Viswanathan says. The love of status shows how rewards programs can fail too. If higher tiers or gifts are too easy to reach the value gets diluted Viswanathan says. People don’t feel special for reaching those upgrades anymore and look for something more exclusive.

Another piece of information that might burst your rewards program bubble: Most companies that offer them have models that are similar to their competitors. Over time businesses have found that constantly undercutting one another and offering more “rewarding” programs is only a race to the bottom Vandenbosch says. The perks and gifts cost the company and if the scenario gets too competitive could dent profits instead of boost them.

So rest assured that no matter which program you pick they’re all similar and have the same aims. And know that your barista didn’t punch two holes in your new rewards card because they were being nice.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vY2FsZ2FyeWhlcmFsZC5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC1uZXdzL2NoZWNrbWF0ZS1jYWxnYXJ5LWhpZ2gtc2Nob29sZXJzLWhlbHAtdW5kZXJwcml2aWxlZ2VkLXlvdXRoLWRpc2NvdmVyLWNoZXNz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Checkmate: Calgary high schoolers help youth discover chess,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/checkmate-calgary-high-schoolers-help-underprivileged-youth-discover-chess on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vY2FsZ2FyeWhlcmFsZC5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC1uZXdzL2NoZWNrbWF0ZS1jYWxnYXJ5LWhpZ2gtc2Nob29sZXJzLWhlbHAtdW5kZXJwcml2aWxlZ2VkLXlvdXRoLWRpc2NvdmVyLWNoZXNz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0dXMtaW5zaWdodHMuY29tL2lubm92YXRvcnMtZ3VpZGUvZGlzY292ZXItNS10b3AtY29uc3RydWN0aW9uLXdvcmtlci1zYWZldHktc29sdXRpb25zL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Discover 5 Top Construction Worker Safety Solutions,"Staying ahead of the technology curve means strengthening your competitive advantage.

Genda develops AI-powered Construction Safety Software

For human workers it is not accurately possible to predict accidents especially while working at a construction worksite. As workers remain unaware and unprepared the consequences of any accidents also worsen. Artificial Intelligence solves this problem by recognizing patterns and predicting the time and location of an accident. Furthermore Internet of Things (IoT)-based sensors detect workers’ location and send them relevant warnings. This enables workers to take necessary actions and reduce the accident risk as well as allows managers to track worker’s location and measure risks.

Israeli startup Genda develops construction software that performs worker safety analytics and provides actionable insights to all stakeholders. The startup combines previous hazard data with current occupancy and hazard reports to identify potential risks using Artificial Intelligence. The software sends real-time alerts to the site workers informing them of any probable hazards around them. Additionally it allows managers to send emergency notifications to the workers and acknowledge their responses.

Invigilo provides a Construction Site Video Analytics Solution

Currently construction companies use cameras to remotely supervise job site workers. But it is still difficult for managers to efficiently identify safety breaches in the video feed. Hence startups provide video analytics solutions that identify risks based on the recording and immediately notify the concerned authority. These solutions use big data and AI to perform analysis on both recorded and live videos. This helps managers to spot abnormalities and avoid accidents while ensuring workers are complying with safety regulations.

Singaporean startup Invigilo develops an intelligent video analytics platform for construction sites. The startup’s product SafeKey uses AI-based object recognition techniques to analyze video and detect threats in real-time. The tool is easy to integrate with existing IP cameras and is highly effective. For example it identifies workers who are not wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) in dangerous areas tracks the movement of heavy vehicles alerts workers coming in proximity to heavy machinery and reports probable hazards.

Ohutu automates Construction Safety Documentation

Since the construction industry bears heavy risks proper documentation protects companies against financial losses. But companies have to implement department-specific regulations and hence manually creating documents is inefficient. As a solution for this startups develop solutions that automate all the paperwork. These solutions collect relevant business details and project information to generate various policies and important documents for the company. Thereby these solutions significantly reduce administrative load and ensure well-defined policies for everyone.

UK-based startup Ohutu automatically creates health and safety documents for construction companies. The startup creates an intelligent questionnaire to collect all required information of a company and provides everything from pre-construction information and construction phase plans to site set up lists display documentation site rules and accident reporting documents. Ohutu also develops mobile applications that allow managers to record employee information as well as access safety documents and report incidents directly on-site.

Plinx builds SmartTags enabling Worker Safety

At construction sites workers are highly prone to accidents involving other co-workers or heavy moving equipment. IoT and wearable technology reduce this risk by embedding sensors in the workers’ PPE and the hardware used during construction. Within this bio-sensors collect information on every worker’s location step count heart rate body temperature etc. to monitor worker health at the construction site. Furthermore sensors detect hazard proximity based on vibrations geographic location and temperature and instantly send safety alerts to prevent accidents.

UK-based startup Plinx develops a construction safety system that manages the proximity of workers to hazards. The system increases worker awareness towards hazards by equipping construction sites with sensor-based tags that accurately detect worker location and provides audiovisual feedback in the hazard proximity. The startup devises three tags the helmet-mounted solution TeamTag which reduces worker’s proximity to co-workers HazardTag which indicates when an operative breaches a restricted zone and MachineTag reducing the machine-to-pedestrian collision likelihood.

NextWave provides Virtual Reality (VR)-based Construction Training

A few years ago risk-free training was not an option especially for hazardous tasks such as material handling terrain leveling welding aerial surveying etc. But computer vision advances training content and procedures. For instance Virtual Reality makes it possible to train remotely in a computer-simulated setting that recreates the real environment. Through this approach workers also get a first-hand immersive experience of the task enabling them to understand workplace risk better and perform the task safely and efficiently in the field. To this end many startups are providing customized Virtual and Augmented Reality (AR)-based training modules to optimize construction worker safety.

USA-based startup NextWave provides VR-based training for construction tasks that are very dull difficult asset-intensive or dangerous to prepare in the field. The startup offers training modules in multiple languages and provides individual trainee scorecards upon completion. In addition to the individual training NextWave enables group VR training by mirroring the VR feed content to an external monitor. The modules are compatible with most available headsets while the startup also provides a comprehensive guide to walk through the installation.

Donald J. Trump the nation's 45th president is unique among U.S. presidents in his connections to the business world. Certainly there have been presidents before him who were businessmen: both George H.W. Bush and his son George W. were in the oil business. Herbert Hoover was in mining and Warren G. Harding was in the newspaper business.

The difference is that every president before Trump had held one or more government positions before taking the office or had served as a general in the military.

This means that Trump's business record and the performance of his companies were the public's only basis for measuring his professional performance before he became president.

We know considerably more now although there is still much to know. Here's what we know and don't know about Trump's business dealings his successes and failures and his financial health as he left the presidency.

Key Takeaways Trump's businesses generated at least $446.3 million in sales in 2019. That dropped about 40% to $278 million in 2020.

The Trump National Doral golf resort generated the most revenue of any of the former president's businesses in 2019 posting $77.2 million in sales. Its revenue plunged more than 40% in 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic year.

Trump's net worth slipped to about $2.3 billion during his presidency compared to about $3 billion before he took office according to Bloomberg. Separately Forbes estimates his current wealth at $2.1 billion.

Separately Forbes estimates his current wealth at $2.1 billion. Trump's personal income is unknown because he lists business revenue instead of profit on his financial disclosures.

Mixing Business and Politics

Trump's potential conflicts of interest were a prominent topic throughout his tenure from 2017 through 2020. As president the enormous power he had at his command made it more important than ever to understand his long list of businesses and how they could intersect with his public role as president.

These conflicts of interest did not pose a legal problem for Trump. The president and vice president are explicitly exempt from ethics regulations concerning conflicts of interest.

There were other issues though such as the emoluments clause which was written into the U.S. Constitution by the nation's founders. The clause prohibits the president from accepting things of value from foreign governments.

Many critics say the emoluments clause applies to Trump in several respects. But none of the many legal cases alleging violations by the former president have been concluded nor does it look like they will be in the near future.

The President's Trust

Most U.S. presidents for the past 40 years chose to put their investments into a blind trust to avoid real or perceived conflicts between the president's financial interests and the nation's best interests.

The owner of a blind trust has no knowledge or control over what assets are in the trust. Their use is a guard against accusations that the powers of the presidency are being used to benefit the office holder's financial interests.

One exception was President Barack Obama who did not use a blind trust because his only investments were in such vehicles as index funds and Treasury notes which were unlikely to pose conflicts of interest.

To create a blind trust it is first necessary to liquidate all of the trust owner's current assets so that new ones can be placed into the trust. Trump's assets were largely in highly illiquid real estate. They would have been costly and time-consuming or even impossible to liquidate. For example Trump can't sell his minority stakes in some office towers without the consent of the real-estate investment trust Vornado Realty Trust (VNO).

So Trump ignored this presidential norm instead of placing his assets in a trust that was managed by his two eldest sons. He was able to withdraw funds from the trust at any time for any reason without disclosing it.

In fact Eric Trump one of the trustees told Forbes in early 2017 that he planned to regularly update his father on the Trump family businesses.

This practice violates trust documents stating that trustees ""shall not provide any report to Donald J. Trump on the holdings and sources of income of the Trust.""

The result was that the president's businesses were held by a trust controlled by his sons and the ability of the trust to insulate the former president from conflicts of interest was questionable.

What We Know

The former president's business activities are largely opaque for several reasons. Trump's main company formally called the Trump Organization is a privately held business and is therefore not required to publish quarterly earnings releases like publicly traded companies do.

The former president has also notably refused to release his tax returns contrary to the recent practice of presidents.

Trump's annual financial disclosures to the U.S. Office of Government Ethics had become the primary avenue to assess what businesses the former president owned and how much they were making.

Every year the president is required to file a list of assets income sources positions held outside the U.S. government business transactions liabilities and gifts received. But in some instances critics say the former president had been reluctant to fully comply with these disclosure requests by delaying filing and going to unusual lengths to avoid providing clear answers to the public.

On Sept. 27 2020 The New York Times released two stories containing data from some 20 years of Trump's tax returns. The full records have not been released.

What We Don't Know

There are some caveats to keep in mind when assessing the data in the Trump Organization's financial disclosure forms.

First the data is unaudited self-reported data meaning that readers have to take the company's word that it's accurate.

Second many of the numbers listed as ""income"" from certain assets seem instead to be the revenue from those businesses. This was confirmed when data from Trump's tax returns were released by The New York Times showing that many of the businesses have been losing money including some of the largest revenue producers such as Trump National Doral golf resort.

That being the case the financial numbers don't show the amount of money that the former president actually took home as income. For example in Trump's 2017 disclosure he listed his income for the Trump National Doral golf resort as $75 million which matches the revenue number reported to Miami-Dade County. Net operating income for the resort for that year was dramatically smaller at $4.3 million.

Getting a clear picture of the former president's businesses is further complicated by the fact that income and asset values are listed in very wide ranges. For example Mar-a-Lago Club is listed as having a value of ""over $50000000."" The Trump National Golf Club in Charlotte is listed as worth between $5 million and $25 million.

Contradictions

Yet another complication is that the Trump Organization itself has contradicted its own numbers in disclosures. The Trump Organization contested Palm Beach County's $19.7 million valuation for the Trump International Golf Club in Jupiter Florida as being too high.

But the former president's government disclosure to the Office of Government Ethics valued the property at more than $50 million. This inflated the value of the former president's property to the public even as he was trying to deflate its value for tax purposes.

This lack of information means that any attempt to put a number on the former president's net worth is at best an educated guess and would require more information than has been disclosed.

Equally important: Because we do not know the expenses of the businesses listed it is impossible to figure out Trump's personal income from his own disclosures.

The Investigations

Public prosecutors are trying to answer these and similar questions. Trump and his company are being investigated by the New York State attorney general over how the Trump Organization values assets on financial statements used to obtain loans.

The Manhattan district attorney appears to be investigating similar claims of inflated asset values. The former president's former lawyer Michael Cohen has testified that Trump regularly inflated the value of company assets to get better loan terms.

On Feb. 22 2021 the U.S. Supreme Court allowed a subpoena by Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. for Donald Trump's tax returns as well as other financial records. Due to grand jury secrecy rules they were not made public.

All of these developments cast doubt on the value of unaudited self-reported financial data from the Trump Organization.

Trump's Current Wealth

Despite these obstacles valuable information can be gleaned from Trump's financial disclosures especially in concert with other information.

Forbes has used financial disclosures and a plethora of other sources to come up with an estimate of Trump's net worth after he left office. The publication currently pegs it at around $2.4 billion. This should be regarded as a rough estimate even though the publication did as thorough a job as possible given the dearth of information.

This $2.4 billion represents a significant drop having fallen from $3.1 billion since the end of 2019. This is largely due to the damage COVID-19 has done to the hotel and casino industries.

The second important financial number we can glean from these documents is that Trump and his businesses generated a minimum of $446.3 million in revenue in 2019 which is up 2.6% from $434.8 million the previous year.

Also available are specific revenue numbers for some of Trump's business interests. The numbers provide a general idea of which Trump businesses are the largest revenue generators and whether revenue is rising or declining.

The Real Sources of Wealth

The former president's businesses generally fall into five categories: hotels golf courses (or some combination of the two) condos residential and commercial real-estate rentals and payments for the licensing of Trump's name.

The New York Times articles unleashed a major new source of information besides confirming that Donald Trump's disclosed income numbers were actually revenue figures.

The numbers also show that companies owned by Trump were incredibly unprofitable for the period between 2000 and 2018. His real sources of income were a television show and some licensing deals.

Although certain enterprises such as Trump Tower have been profitable Trump businesses overall lost $174.5 million from 2000–2018. During the same period of time his net income from licensing and endorsement deals was $230 million his net income from The Apprentice television show was $197.3 million and his income from other investments in companies run by other people was $178.7 million.

Top 5 Businesses Owned by Donald Trump

The list below is limited to businesses for which a specific revenue amount was given. The numbers are the latest available from documents.

1. Trump National Doral

2019 Revenue: $77207936

2018 Revenue: $75962848

2019 Asset Value: Over $50000000

Business Type: Golf Resort

What is now the Trump National Doral golf resort was founded in 1962 in Doral near Miami. Trump bought the resort out of bankruptcy for $150 million in 2012.

The Doral was the source of considerable controversy in 2019 when the former president announced plans to hold the 2020 meeting of the G7 at Trump National Doral. He withdrew the proposal after accusations that this was an attempt to profit from his presidency.

2. Trump Old Post Office LLC

2019 Revenue: $40523041

2018 Revenue: $40842294

2019 Asset Value: Over $50000000

Business Type: Hotel

This business is a holding company for the Trump International Hotel in Washington D.C. which operates in the Old Post Office building a national landmark. Trump's company holds a long-term lease on the property owned by the U.S. government which could last nearly 100 years with extensions.

The hotel was at the center of a major emoluments case against the former president. A group of hotel and restaurant owners sued Trump for violating the emoluments clause alleging that he was unconstitutionally profiting from his office because his hotel gets the business of foreign officials staying there to curry his favor. The group argued that this gave the former president's hotel an unfair competitive advantage against their businesses.

Possibly as a result of lawsuits and public criticism the Trump Organization planned to sell its lease to the property. They were seeking a purchase price of more than $500 million one of the highest-priced hotel deals per room ever. The sale process was placed on hold due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

3. Trump Ruffin Tower LLC

2019 Revenue: $27677448 divided between $4414500 in condo sales and $23262948 in hotel revenue

2018 Revenue: $28558298 divided between $6002244 in condo sales and $22556054 in hotel revenue

2019 Asset Value: Over $50000000

Business Type: Hotel and Condominium Complex

Trump Ruffin Tower LLC manages the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Las Vegas. Constructed in 2008 the tower is a combination hotel and condominium development.

It struggled as the Great Recession hit when it opened more than a decade ago devastating the real estate market. Plans for a second tower were scrapped.

4. Trump Turnberry

2019 Revenue: 25691318

2018 Revenue: $23446634

2019 Asset Value: Over $50000000

Business Type: Golf Resort

Originally built in 1906 by Archibald Kennedy the third Marquess of Ailsa Trump Turnberry is one of two golf resorts the former president owns in Scotland.

Trump purchased the Turnberry resort from a Dubai-based company for an undisclosed sum.

5. Mar-a-Lago Club LLC

2019 Revenue: 21432344

2018 Revenue: $22692146

2019 Asset Value: Over $50000000

Business Type: Hotel and Resort

The Mar-a-Lago Club was built as a private mansion in 1927 by Marjorie Merriweather Post who inherited the Postum Cereal Company which later became the General Foods Corporation.

In 1968 she decided to donate Mar-a-Lago to the U.S. government to serve as a winter White House. When she died in 1973 the government refused the gift due to its high maintenance costs.

The estate was purchased by Trump in 1985 for a reported $8 million. He used it as a winter White House and continues to operate it as a private resort club.

2020 Challenges

The year 2020 was challenging for the former president's businesses because the COVID-19 pandemic hit the hospitality industry hard.

A study by the American Hotel & Lodging Association (AHLA) found that nearly nine in 10 hotels resorted to furloughs or layoffs in 2020. More than half of the hotel owners surveyed said they were in danger of losing their properties to foreclosure.

The Trump Organization laid off roughly 1500 employees due to COVID-19 as of the beginning of April 2020 including 560 at Trump National Doral.

Trump's largest business by revenue Trump National Doral had to close in March along with many of his other properties.

It reopened in June 2020 along with several other Trump hotels.

Trump's Failed Businesses

Trump's current businesses give only a partial picture of his record as a businessman. Over the course of his several decades as a real estate executive he has created a long list of companies that have been sold or dissolved or which have gone bankrupt.

Trump companies have filed for bankruptcy six separate times a fact Trump has bragged about saying he has ""used brilliantly the laws of the country.""

One Decade of Business Dealings

A useful snapshot is Trump's record during the 10 years before he won the presidency. From 2006–2016 The New York Times went through every business deal that the Trump Organization announced or that was reported.

The 60 deals reflected a highly uneven track record of business success: ""One-third of them never got off the ground or soon petered out. Another third delivered a measure of what was promised—buildings were built courses taught a product introduced—but they also encountered substantial problems like lawsuits government investigations partnership woes or market downturns...The remaining third while sometimes encountering strife generally met expectations"" according to The New York Times.

Any deeper examination of the former president's business record would be incomplete without looking at his series of high-profile bankruptcies and other failures. Below is a list of some of the highlights although it is by no means comprehensive.

Trump's Casinos

In the early 1990s Donald Trump faced personal bankruptcy due to large personal debts deteriorating finances and a trio of money-losing casinos in Atlantic City. His largest casino Trump Taj Mahal had already declared bankruptcy in 1991.

To deal with this Trump launched an initial public offering (IPO) of Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts. The public offering raised enough money for Trump to avoid personal bankruptcy and allowed him to offload his heavily indebted casinos to investors. Trump stepped down in 2009 as chairperson of the company whose name had been changed to Trump Entertainment Resorts in 2005.

By then the company had gone through bankruptcy twice and investors had lost ""well over 90 cents on the dollar"" according to billionaire Warren Buffett.

Trump Entertainment Resorts went back into bankruptcy in 2014 and was sold to Icahn Enterprises (IEP) in 2016 resulting in Trump losing his stake in the company. The Taj Mahal which Trump spent $1.2 billion to build in 1990 was later sold by Icahn Enterprises for $50 million or 4% of its cost to Hard Rock International in 2017.

Trump Model Management

Trump Model Management was a modeling agency Trump founded. The company is a natural extension of Trump's interest in beauty pageants with his production company formerly producing Miss USA pageants and a TV tie-in titled Pageant Place.

In April 2017 news that Trump Model Management would shut down surfaced after an email from the company's president leaked. Some speculate that the decision to shut down was due to the accusations from some foreign-born former models that they had been hired without the necessary work visas.

Trump Model Management denied using illegal labor practices. Trump himself held an 85% stake in the business before it dissolved.

The Trump Entrepreneur Initiative

The now-defunct Trump Entrepreneur Initiative was once known as Trump University. The for-profit education company offered courses in real estate asset management entrepreneurship and wealth creation.

The company was not an accredited school and did not offer high school or college credits.

The company was embroiled in an ongoing high-profile scandal during Trump's presidential campaign and it continued into his tenure as president.

The Trump Entrepreneur Initiative faced a lawsuit in 2013 alleging illegal business practices. The New York state attorney general filed a $40 million civil suit that alleged the corporation made false promises to its students.

A New York judge found Trump personally responsible. In late March 2017 when Trump was serving as president a judge approved a $25 million settlement for the defrauded students.

Trump Ice Natural Spring Water

Trump Ice was a bottled water brand. The winner of The Apprentice Season 2 Kelly Perdew served as executive vice president of the organization.

The company's website no longer exists and the product can no longer be found in national grocery chains or stores but some can still be found on eBay and other auction sites.

The company was used as a gimmick in the show's first season when contestants marketed and sold the product.

While 'Crocs' are quite the controversial shoe choice the report adds that the company had their most successful year yet in 2020. Likely in thanks to some limited edition shoe runs like the 'Cars' themed slides or their Luke Combs collaboration and also their brand being involved in charity work. Post Malone even donated thousands of pairs of crocs to healthcare worker across the U.S. in the midst of a pandemic.

Whatever your opinion on 'Crocs' are they're clearly doing something right. They have a rabid consumer base that has continually purchased their products and have solidified their brand as a household name.

Donald J. Trump the nation's 45th president is unique among U.S. presidents in his connections to the business world. Certainly there have been presidents before him who were businessmen: both George H.W. Bush and his son George W. were in the oil business. Herbert Hoover was in mining and Warren G. Harding was in the newspaper business.

The difference is that every president before Trump had held one or more government positions before taking the office or had served as a general in the military.

This means that Trump's business record and the performance of his companies were the public's only basis for measuring his professional performance before he became president.

We know considerably more now although there is still much to know. Here's what we know and don't know about Trump's business dealings his successes and failures and his financial health as he left the presidency.

Key Takeaways Trump's businesses generated at least $446.3 million in sales in 2019. That dropped about 40% to $278 million in 2020.

The Trump National Doral golf resort generated the most revenue of any of the former president's businesses in 2019 posting $77.2 million in sales. Its revenue plunged more than 40% in 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic year.

Trump's net worth slipped to about $2.3 billion during his presidency compared to about $3 billion before he took office according to Bloomberg. Separately Forbes estimates his current wealth at $2.1 billion.

Separately Forbes estimates his current wealth at $2.1 billion. Trump's personal income is unknown because he lists business revenue instead of profit on his financial disclosures.

Mixing Business and Politics

Trump's potential conflicts of interest were a prominent topic throughout his tenure from 2017 through 2020. As president the enormous power he had at his command made it more important than ever to understand his long list of businesses and how they could intersect with his public role as president.

These conflicts of interest did not pose a legal problem for Trump. The president and vice president are explicitly exempt from ethics regulations concerning conflicts of interest.

There were other issues though such as the emoluments clause which was written into the U.S. Constitution by the nation's founders. The clause prohibits the president from accepting things of value from foreign governments.

Many critics say the emoluments clause applies to Trump in several respects. But none of the many legal cases alleging violations by the former president have been concluded nor does it look like they will be in the near future.

The President's Trust

Most U.S. presidents for the past 40 years chose to put their investments into a blind trust to avoid real or perceived conflicts between the president's financial interests and the nation's best interests.

The owner of a blind trust has no knowledge or control over what assets are in the trust. Their use is a guard against accusations that the powers of the presidency are being used to benefit the office holder's financial interests.

One exception was President Barack Obama who did not use a blind trust because his only investments were in such vehicles as index funds and Treasury notes which were unlikely to pose conflicts of interest.

Trump's assets were largely in highly illiquid real estate. They would have been costly and time-consuming or even impossible to liquidate. For example Trump can't sell his minority stakes in some office towers without the consent of the real-estate investment trust Vornado Realty Trust (VNO).

So Trump ignored this presidential norm instead of placing his assets in a trust that was managed by his two eldest sons. He was able to withdraw funds from the trust at any time for any reason without disclosing it.

In fact Eric Trump one of the trustees told Forbes in early 2017 that he planned to regularly update his father on the Trump family businesses.

On Sept. 27 2020 The New York Times released two stories containing data from some 20 years of Trump's tax returns. The full records have not been released.

What We Don't Know

There are some caveats to keep in mind when assessing the data in the Trump Organization's financial disclosure forms.

First the data is unaudited self-reported data meaning that readers have to take the company's word that it's accurate.

For example in Trump's 2017 disclosure he listed his income for the Trump National Doral golf resort as $75 million which matches the revenue number reported to Miami-Dade County. Net operating income for the resort for that year was dramatically smaller at $4.3 million.

Getting a clear picture of the former president's businesses is further complicated by the fact that income and asset values are listed in very wide ranges. For example Mar-a-Lago Club is listed as having a value of ""over $50000000."" The Trump National Golf Club in Charlotte is listed as worth between $5 million and $25 million.

Contradictions

Yet another complication is that the Trump Organization itself has contradicted its own numbers in disclosures. The Trump Organization contested Palm Beach County's $19.7 million valuation for the Trump International Golf Club in Jupiter Florida as being too high.

All of these developments cast doubt on the value of unaudited self-reported financial data from the Trump Organization.

Trump's Current Wealth

Despite these obstacles valuable information can be gleaned from Trump's financial disclosures especially in concert with other information.

Forbes has used financial disclosures and a plethora of other sources to come up with an estimate of Trump's net worth after he left office. The publication currently pegs it at around $2.4 billion. This should be regarded as a rough estimate even though the publication did as thorough a job as possible given the dearth of information.

This $2.4 billion represents a significant drop having fallen from $3.1 billion since the end of 2019. This is largely due to the damage COVID-19 has done to the hotel and casino industries.

The second important financial number we can glean from these documents is that Trump and his businesses generated a minimum of $446.3 million in revenue in 2019 which is up 2.6% from $434.8 million the previous year.

Also available are specific revenue numbers for some of Trump's business interests. The numbers provide a general idea of which Trump businesses are the largest revenue generators and whether revenue is rising or declining.

The Real Sources of Wealth

The former president's businesses generally fall into five categories: hotels golf courses (or some combination of the two) condos residential and commercial real-estate rentals and payments for the licensing of Trump's name.

The New York Times articles unleashed a major new source of information besides confirming that Donald Trump's disclosed income numbers were actually revenue figures.

The numbers also show that companies owned by Trump were incredibly unprofitable for the period between 2000 and 2018. His real sources of income were a television show and some licensing deals.

Although certain enterprises such as Trump Tower have been profitable Trump businesses overall lost $174.5 million from 2000–2018. During the same period of time his net income from licensing and endorsement deals was $230 million his net income from The Apprentice television show was $197.3 million and his income from other investments in companies run by other people was $178.7 million.

Top 5 Businesses Owned by Donald Trump

The list below is limited to businesses for which a specific revenue amount was given. The numbers are the latest available from documents.

1. Trump National Doral

2019 Revenue: $77207936

2018 Revenue: $75962848

2019 Asset Value: Over $50000000

Business Type: Golf Resort

What is now the Trump National Doral golf resort was founded in 1962 in Doral near Miami. Trump bought the resort out of bankruptcy for $150 million in 2012.

The Doral was the source of considerable controversy in 2019 when the former president announced plans to hold the 2020 meeting of the G7 at Trump National Doral. He withdrew the proposal after accusations that this was an attempt to profit from his presidency.

2. Trump Old Post Office LLC

2019 Revenue: $40523041

2018 Revenue: $40842294

2019 Asset Value: Over $50000000

Business Type: Hotel

This business is a holding company for the Trump International Hotel in Washington D.C. which operates in the Old Post Office building a national landmark. Trump's company holds a long-term lease on the property owned by the U.S. government which could last nearly 100 years with extensions.

The hotel was at the center of a major emoluments case against the former president. A group of hotel and restaurant owners sued Trump for violating the emoluments clause alleging that he was unconstitutionally profiting from his office because his hotel gets the business of foreign officials staying there to curry his favor. The group argued that this gave the former president's hotel an unfair competitive advantage against their businesses.

Possibly as a result of lawsuits and public criticism the Trump Organization planned to sell its lease to the property. They were seeking a purchase price of more than $500 million one of the highest-priced hotel deals per room ever. The sale process was placed on hold due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

3. Trump Ruffin Tower LLC

2019 Revenue: $27677448 divided between $4414500 in condo sales and $23262948 in hotel revenue

2018 Revenue: $28558298 divided between $6002244 in condo sales and $22556054 in hotel revenue

2019 Asset Value: Over $50000000

Business Type: Hotel and Condominium Complex

Trump Ruffin Tower LLC manages the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Las Vegas. Constructed in 2008 the tower is a combination hotel and condominium development.

It struggled as the Great Recession hit when it opened more than a decade ago devastating the real estate market. Plans for a second tower were scrapped.

4. Trump Turnberry

2019 Revenue: 25691318

2018 Revenue: $23446634

2019 Asset Value: Over $50000000

Business Type: Golf Resort

Originally built in 1906 by Archibald Kennedy the third Marquess of Ailsa Trump Turnberry is one of two golf resorts the former president owns in Scotland.

Trump purchased the Turnberry resort from a Dubai-based company for an undisclosed sum.

5. Mar-a-Lago Club LLC

2019 Revenue: 21432344

2018 Revenue: $22692146

2019 Asset Value: Over $50000000

Business Type: Hotel and Resort

The Mar-a-Lago Club was built as a private mansion in 1927 by Marjorie Merriweather Post who inherited the Postum Cereal Company which later became the General Foods Corporation.

In 1968 she decided to donate Mar-a-Lago to the U.S. government to serve as a winter White House. When she died in 1973 the government refused the gift due to its high maintenance costs.

The estate was purchased by Trump in 1985 for a reported $8 million. He used it as a winter White House and continues to operate it as a private resort club.

2020 Challenges

The year 2020 was challenging for the former president's businesses because the COVID-19 pandemic hit the hospitality industry hard.

A study by the American Hotel & Lodging Association (AHLA) found that nearly nine in 10 hotels resorted to furloughs or layoffs in 2020. More than half of the hotel owners surveyed said they were in danger of losing their properties to foreclosure.

The Trump Organization laid off roughly 1500 employees due to COVID-19 as of the beginning of April 2020 including 560 at Trump National Doral.

Trump's largest business by revenue Trump National Doral had to close in March along with many of his other properties.

It reopened in June 2020 along with several other Trump hotels.

Trump's Failed Businesses

Trump's current businesses give only a partial picture of his record as a businessman. Over the course of his several decades as a real estate executive he has created a long list of companies that have been sold or dissolved or which have gone bankrupt.

Trump companies have filed for bankruptcy six separate times a fact Trump has bragged about saying he has ""used brilliantly the laws of the country.""

One Decade of Business Dealings

A useful snapshot is Trump's record during the 10 years before he won the presidency. From 2006–2016 The New York Times went through every business deal that the Trump Organization announced or that was reported.

The 60 deals reflected a highly uneven track record of business success: ""One-third of them never got off the ground or soon petered out. Another third delivered a measure of what was promised—buildings were built courses taught a product introduced—but they also encountered substantial problems like lawsuits government investigations partnership woes or market downturns...The remaining third while sometimes encountering strife generally met expectations"" according to The New York Times.

Any deeper examination of the former president's business record would be incomplete without looking at his series of high-profile bankruptcies and other failures. Below is a list of some of the highlights although it is by no means comprehensive.

Trump's Casinos

In the early 1990s Donald Trump faced personal bankruptcy due to large personal debts deteriorating finances and a trio of money-losing casinos in Atlantic City. His largest casino Trump Taj Mahal had already declared bankruptcy in 1991.

To deal with this Trump launched an initial public offering (IPO) of Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts. The public offering raised enough money for Trump to avoid personal bankruptcy and allowed him to offload his heavily indebted casinos to investors. Trump stepped down in 2009 as chairperson of the company whose name had been changed to Trump Entertainment Resorts in 2005.

By then the company had gone through bankruptcy twice and investors had lost ""well over 90 cents on the dollar"" according to billionaire Warren Buffett.

Trump Entertainment Resorts went back into bankruptcy in 2014 and was sold to Icahn Enterprises (IEP) in 2016 resulting in Trump losing his stake in the company. The Taj Mahal which Trump spent $1.2 billion to build in 1990 was later sold by Icahn Enterprises for $50 million or 4% of its cost to Hard Rock International in 2017.

Trump Model Management

Trump Model Management was a modeling agency Trump founded. The company is a natural extension of Trump's interest in beauty pageants with his production company formerly producing Miss USA pageants and a TV tie-in titled Pageant Place.

In April 2017 news that Trump Model Management would shut down surfaced after an email from the company's president leaked. Some speculate that the decision to shut down was due to the accusations from some foreign-born former models that they had been hired without the necessary work visas.

Trump Model Management denied using illegal labor practices. Trump himself held an 85% stake in the business before it dissolved.

The Trump Entrepreneur Initiative

The now-defunct Trump Entrepreneur Initiative was once known as Trump University. The for-profit education company offered courses in real estate asset management entrepreneurship and wealth creation.

The company was not an accredited school and did not offer high school or college credits.

The company was embroiled in an ongoing high-profile scandal during Trump's presidential campaign and it continued into his tenure as president.

The Trump Entrepreneur Initiative faced a lawsuit in 2013 alleging illegal business practices. The New York state attorney general filed a $40 million civil suit that alleged the corporation made false promises to its students.

A New York judge found Trump personally responsible. In late March 2017 when Trump was serving as president a judge approved a $25 million settlement for the defrauded students.

Trump Ice Natural Spring Water

Trump Ice was a bottled water brand. The winner of The Apprentice Season 2 Kelly Perdew served as executive vice president of the organization.

The company's website no longer exists and the product can no longer be found in national grocery chains or stores but some can still be found on eBay and other auction sites.

The company was used as a gimmick in the show's first season when contestants marketed and sold the product.

Koon a Chapin native retired in 2011 after operating a nuclear power plant which is now part of Dominion Energy. He said he sends his council pay back to the town.

“I’m not doing it to make money. That’s not at all the purpose” Koon said.

Koon is currently the only candidate who has publicly announced plans to run.

Chapin’s current mayor 78-year-old David Knight said he never intended to run for a second term. He plans to continue his work part-time as an attorney at his law practice.

""He and I have discussed his succession of me and I'm fully in support of that” Knight said.

Koon said he loves the small-town feel of Chapin and wants to help the town manage the population boom the surrounding area is experiencing.

""The thing that has driven me to be involved at all has to do with planning for our town” Koon said. “Although we have a very small town what we do affects the entire community.""

While the town of Chapin includes less than two square miles of land and cannot expand much further the unincorporated area of Chapin includes roughly 20000 people and the entire 29036 zip code.

The Town Council is currently working on a growth plan to identify Chapin’s needs.

""A lot of people don't want a lot of growth but we know that's not reasonable” Koon 69 said. “There will be growth and we want to manage that growth in a small way. We want to make our town one that people are proud to live in.""

If elected Koon plans to use the completed growth plan to create a strategic plan with specific steps the town will take to manage growth. He said he wants to complete this before the first quarter of the year ends.

Though growth-management plans are in the works Koon said this is a project that will take decades to complete.",,,,,,,,,

Within 15 minutes you're on your way to curing that pizza craving but the full menu doesn't tell the whole story. Like Mcdonald's Burger King KFC Taco Bell and other fast food joints this pizza chain has a secret menu where you can snag new pizzas galore. Yep Domino's secret menu is a thing.

To be honest I was a little surprised that a secret menu even exists. Domino's pizza is known for letting you create what you want so why does the fast food chain need to have a separate menu? Well it turns out that they're more creative than we are. Here are a few Domino's secret menu items you're going to want to try the next time you call them.

Domino's Secret Menu

1. All Day Breakfast Pizza

Although it's only available by word of mouth in Australia and the U.K. we're about to dish out the ingredients to their breakfast pizza so you can customize the exact same way.

""...If you're into trying fun breakfast combinations this one is comprised of a pizza loaded with bacon tomato slices red onion and scrambled eggs. If you want BBQ sauce can (or will depending on where you order from) sometimes be added-on"" Mashed revealed.

2. Super Lot Pizza

If you're a meat-head then you need to try this pizza off the Domino's secret menu.

""The Super Lot Pizza features an irresistible combination of pepperoni olives ham ground beef red onion mushrooms oregano and pineapple. While we know the ingredient can be a bit off-putting to some the pineapple does not distract from the rest of this meaty dish"" Mashed continued.

3. Sausage Sizzle Pizza

Seeing as this one was available for only a limited time while it was trending in January we aren't sure if you'll be able to order this directly but it's definitely worth the try if you want to be Aussie adventurous.

Apparently you can find the secret menu on their app under VIP access. That's where Yahoo! Lifestyle found the Sausage Sizzle and said it ""...features BBQ beef sausage grilled onion and mozzarella. It's also topped with tomato sauce and mustard and is $7.95 if you pick up or $15 with Domino's Any Pizza Delivered deal.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc3RvZGF5LmluL3RyZW5kaW5nL3N0b3J5L3Rva3lvLW9seW1waWNzLWRvbWlub3Mtb2ZmZXJzLWxpZmV0aW1lLWZyZWUtcGl6emEtdG8tbWlyYWJhaS1jaGFudS1hZnRlci1oaXN0b3JpYy1zaWx2ZXItbWVkYWwtMzAyMzQ2LTIwMjEtMDctMjXSAaABaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3N0b2RheS5pbi9hbXAvdHJlbmRpbmcvc3RvcnkvdG9reW8tb2x5bXBpY3MtZG9taW5vcy1vZmZlcnMtbGlmZXRpbWUtZnJlZS1waXp6YS10by1taXJhYmFpLWNoYW51LWFmdGVyLWhpc3RvcmljLXNpbHZlci1tZWRhbC0zMDIzNDYtMjAyMS0wNy0yNQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tokyo Olympics: Dominos offers lifetime free pizza to Mirabai Chanu after historic silver medal,"Dominos India has offered free pizzas for life to Mirabai Chanu who created history on Saturday by winning silver medal for India on the first day of Tokyo Olympics.

In an interview after her match Chanu when asked about what she would like to eat said she would eat pizza as she had not eaten it for a long-time because of her training and fitness requirements. This led to users on Twitter asking Domino's India to offer her free pizza for life.

Responding to once such tweet Dominos India wrote ""We agree 1000% with you. We never want @mirabai_chanu to wait to eat Slice of pizza again so we're treating her to FREE Domino's pizza for life! #PizzasForLife.""

Revolt Motor to phase out RV300 launch new cheaper model

Revolt Motor will launch a new model RV1 with lower pricing which is expected to go into production from early next year Anjali Rattan promoter of Rattan India Enterprises Ltd (REL) has said.



The Gurugram-based Revolt Motors currently has two bike models the flagship RV400 and RV300 in its product portfolio.



Formerly known as RattanIndia Infra the company in early April announced it was exiting from the traditional infra business to focus on new growth businesses. In late April it announced acquiring a 43 per cent stake in Revolt Motor for Rs 150 crore.



""We will be phasing out RV 300 model eventually. In its place we will be introducing a new model RV1 at a lower price which would be a new model altogether Rattan told PTI.



She said the production of the new model will commence from early next year and it will be 100 per cent indigenised e-bike she said.



""By December this year our product will become completely make-in-India. We have been importing parts from China but we are now focusing on every single supply from India. The manufacturing of the new bike will start from January she said.



Revolt Motors has its manufacturing plant in Manesar (Haryana).



With Revolt REL has launched a new investment cycle in tech-driven transformative she said adding ""the digital ecosystem will be the key driver in India's aspiration for a $5 trillion economy.""



Noting that about 1-billion Indians will have a large digital footprint she said RattanIndia will capitalize on businesses with cutting-edge technologies which have the potential to transform billions plus Indians.



The new age sectors with large addressable markets and fast growth will be the new business avenues for REL. So all new tech-businesses will grow many fold for the next five years she added.

Stating the electric mobility market which was USD 5 billion till 2020 will go five times in 2025 she said India is the largest 2-wheeler market and within that the largest bike market as well.

""The 2-wheeler market in India is still grappling with BSVI norms while the world is moving towards green EVS. So India's largest two wheeler market is ready to be transformed by new technology"" she added.



She said according to a recent Mckinsey report the e-two wheelers market is expected to be around Rs 50000 crore by 2025 with annual sales of 50 lakh units.

She said with strong government support of 5 per cent GST on the e-bikes against 28 per cent on fossil fuel run bikes and revision in the FAME II incentives (incentives of Rs 28000 for e-bikes) among others along with the incentives by various state governments makes these bikes quite affordable vis-a vis petrol bikes.

""So the two wheeler's sales have rapidly shifted towards EV for an unbeatable value proposition"" she added.



Stating that Revolt Motors is seeing an increased demand which had forced it to pause the bookings of its bikes many times in the last two months Rattan said the company is aiming to produce five lakh bikes per annum in the next five years.

EVs also offer a large market for exports to EV OEMs she said adding there is a huge opportunity for EV exports originating out of India.

""EV two wheeler leaders from India have the potential to capture significant exports as well"" she added.

Workers at the Frito-Lay plant in Topeka Kansas say it used to be one of the best jobs in town – a place of shared meals group outings and community.

In recent years though employees and union members say the facility where Doritos Cheetos and Tostitos are made has become another toxic work environment.

Hundreds of Frito-Lay workers at the Topeka facility are in week three of a strike over what union leaders describe as long hours forced overtime stagnating wages and a diminished quality of life. It’s the first strike at the plant in its decades of operation.

Members of the Bakery Confectionery Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers Local 218 union have called on the snack food company to provide better working conditions and pay. Among their grievances are so-called “suicide shifts” in which employees work a full eight-hour day plus four hours of overtime with little turnaround time before the next shift.

“Workers do not have enough time to see their family do chores around the house run errands or even get a healthy night’s sleep” the union’s international president Anthony Shelton said in a July 12 statement. “This strike is about working people having a voice in their futures and taking a stand for their families.”

Frito-Lay which is owned by PepsiCo said in a statement that the claims about long hours were “grossly exaggerated.” It also pointed to a contract offer it made prior to the strike that would cap overtime limits at 60 hours and end what it referred to as “squeeze shifts.”

Corrina Christensen communications director for the main Bakery Confectionery Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers union told CNN on Thursday that negotiations had concluded and that it would not comment further until after a vote by members. Frito-Lay did not address specific requests for comment by CNN instead pointing to public statements released this week.

Workers feel they’re being ‘pushed to the edge’

As the nation continues to recover from the pandemic PepsiCo recently reported quarterly earnings that surpassed Wall Street estimates – Frito-Lay North America saw its organic revenue grow by 6%.

Workers at the Topeka plant however feel burned out.

Union leaders said in a podcast interview last week that they had asked management for years to address staffing shortages that resulted in forced overtime and long shifts but that the issues were not adequately addressed.

“Before we walked out on the strike they were 100 employees short already which is where a lot of the overtime comes in” said Paul Klemme chief steward of Local 218.

Mark McCarter a Frito-Lay employee and union representative who has been working at the Topeka facility for more than three decades told VICE that he makes $20.50 an hour despite his long career with the company and hasn’t received a proper raise in 10 years.

“I think people are pushed to the edge” he told the outlet. “COVID created some of this. During COVID managers got to work from home. People see that and realize they have other options. Everyone’s hiring and raising their pay because no one wants to work for $8 an hour anymore.”

Cherie Renfro another worker at the facility criticized Frito-Lay for giving bonuses instead of raises and accused the company of lowering wages for new employees. She also said workers did not receive hazard pay or other recognition for the risks they took throughout the pandemic.

“You have no problem paying for the drug tests background checks orientation and training for 350-plus employees that you hired and lost this past year” Renfro wrote in the Topeka Capital-Journal. “But you have a problem giving decent living wages to keep loyal employees already trained already here.”

More than 800 workers are affected by the strike.

Where things stand

Union membership voted down a July 1 offer made by Frito-Lay before going on strike.

Negotiations resumed this week and on Thursday the two sides concluded their talks.

Frito-Lay said in a statement that the new offer “will better address employee concerns around guaranteed days off and create additional opportunities for the union to have input into staffing and overtime” adding that it would include across-the-board wage increases.

Christensen the spokesperson for the main union said members are currently voting on the contract and that results are expected late Friday.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3NsZXR0ZXIuY28udWsvc3BvcnQvY3JpY2tldC9qYW1lcy1jYW1lcm9uLWRvdy10aHJpdmluZy1hZnRlci1jaXltcy1yZXNodWZmbGUtMzMyMTIwNdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,James Cameron-Dow thriving after CIYMS reshuffle,"James Cameron-Dow. Photo by David Maginnis/Pacemaker Press

James Cameron-Dow will return to Ballygomartin Road today for a Robinson Services Premier League fixture against Woodvale just six days after scoring his first CIYMS century there.

The 31-year-old struck 104 in last Sunday’s 90-run Gallagher Challenge Cup quarter-final victory and brought up a maiden NCU hundred in the process.

Cameron-Dow who is more known for his left-arm spin has been promoted up the batting order to number three in the absence of Irish international Mark Adair and has been thriving in his new role. He scored 71 against Carrickfergus last month before following it up with 54 in a league defeat to Waringstown.

Having hit 41 on Test debut for Ireland against Afghanistan in 2019 his batting ability has been clear for some time but not even Cameron-Dow expected himself to be reaching this landmark.

“We have had a tricky first couple of rounds in the Challenge Cup with two Premier League teams so it was great to progress to the next round” he reflected.

“From a personal perspective it was my first hundred in Northern Ireland and it’s fantastic to get that achievement.

“It’s probably something if you asked me last season or the season before I would say it wasn’t on the cards and I suppose even if you asked me a couple of weeks ago it wouldn’t have been on the cards in the near future.

“It was a really special moment and I really enjoyed it.”

CIYMS have rarely been at full strength this season with Adair and new signing Graham Kennedy involved with Ireland while captain Nigel Jones has had coaching commitments with Leinster Lightning and fast bowler Allen Coulter is currently injured.

That has put more importance on the role of Cameron-Dow but as he explains there isn’t any pressure when walking to the crease.

“I wouldn’t say it’s more responsibility” he said.

“I think it allows me to play more of my natural game and probably without expectation. I certainly feel like there’s not much expectation.

“I feel like I can walk out to bat do what comes naturally to me and nobody really expects a huge amount.

“You have Jay (van der Merwe) and Jonesy coming in behind me and Doc (Chris Dougherty) or Matchy (John Matchett) batting with me when I walk out to the crease. I’m certainly the least expected of the batters to do well!”

Cameron-Dow was the joint-highest wicket-taker in the NCU in 2019 after picking up 47 in 29 matches but the off-spinner has had to deal with fluctuations of form and confidence during the current campaign.

He came out of the Twenty20 period with nine wickets but has felt his bowling isn’t where he wants it to be and is working to get back to top form.

“Sunday was probably one of the better days I’ve had with the ball but I’m really missing the regular training and long spells in red ball cricket which I relied on heavily to get me some rhythm and form” he added.

“I was training three or four times a week with the Knights which I’m not able to do at the moment so I feel like I’m short of rhythm but Saturday-Sunday cricket helps me and the more I play of that the better I feel with the ball.

“Hopefully Sunday was the start of a pathway back to where I want to be.

“There was a little phase where I didn’t bowl a ball in practice in about three weeks so you feel decent at one point one Saturday and then the next I stand at the top of my mark before bowling the first ball of my spell thinking where is this going to go which is a horrible horrible feeling.

“Sitting in the changing room after Saturday’s game (vs North Down) where I got hit in front of all three by a full toss after bowling seven overs of absolute rubbish and I was thinking I hate this game!

“Then going into Sunday it’s completely different and you’re sitting at Woodvale in the sun with a winning beer and feeling fantastic about life.

“I’ve got through ups and downs in the past and will have to go through them in the future. It doesn’t make it any easier to go through them and Saturday was really bottom of the bottom.

“It only takes 24 hours until you’re then top of the top. You just have to stay strong and try to keep the peaks and troughs as shallow as possible.”

Cameron-Dow is also busy away from playing duties as he has taken on a new role as Director of Youth Cricket at Instonians.

“It has been absolutely brilliant” he said

“Summer camps are running right through until the middle of August and we’ve been into schools so there has been loads going on.

“We are trying to build up a big number at the young levels which will hopefully produce some really good players as they get older and move into the senior club.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm91cm1pZGxhbmQuY29tL25ld3MvYXJ0aWNsZS9NZWV0LVlvdXItTmVpZ2hib3ItTWF0dC1HcmFuem8tMTYzMzE5MjIucGhw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Meet Your Neighbor: Matt Granzo,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.ourmidland.com/news/article/Meet-Your-Neighbor-Matt-Granzo-16331922.php on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm91cm1pZGxhbmQuY29tL25ld3MvYXJ0aWNsZS9NZWV0LVlvdXItTmVpZ2hib3ItTWF0dC1HcmFuem8tMTYzMzE5MjIucGhw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

The east side of the Dallas/Fort Worth metro area has been experiencing booming growth in the past year and that’s reflected in RCLCO Real Estate Advisors’ semiannual list of the top-50 master-planned communities.

The Maryland-based real-estate consultant firm has been ranking master-planned community sales since 1994. Master-planned communities are much larger than normal housing subdivisions and can feature some of the most coveted amenities including Crystal Lagoons coffee shops elaborate community gardens and as close as you’ll get to a 24-hour concierge outside a high-rise condo tower.

Among the Dallas-area communities Woodcreek Fate near Rockwall ranks 30th Magnolia Point in Josephine 34th and Wildcat Ranch in Crandall 39th in RCLCO’s ranking.

Other North Texas communities on the list are Harvest in Argyle (41st) Union Park in Little Elm (43rd) and Viridian in Arlington (48th). In January Woodcreek Fate and Union Park were tied for 24th.

Eighteen Texas communities landed on the list and ranked second in the number of homes sold in master-planned communities behind only Florida.

The Houston-The Woodlands-Sugar Land area placed 10 communities on the list. Austin-Round Rock and El Paso placed one each.

Woodcreek which is near Lake Ray Hubbard and The Harbor in Rockwall registered 322 sales. Woodcreek which was 32nd in the 2020 mid-year rankings was developed by Dallas-based PMB Capital Investments and Southstar Development.

Magnolia Point north of Royse City with 301 sales is a project by Arlington-based D.R. Horton. Wildcat Range with 285 sales is also developed by PMB Capital. Dallas-based Hillwood Communities developed Harvest (279) and Johnson Development Corp developed Viridian (266) which was 41st in the 2020 mid-year list.

Lakewood Ranch developed by Schroeder-Manatee Ranch Inc. in Sarasota Fla. is the best-selling master-planned community in 2021 with 1535 sales 83 percent ahead of last year’s pace. Mission Ridge in El Paso sold 466 homes ranking first in Texas and ninth overall.

D.R. Horton is the developer for sixth-ranked Valley Vista in North Las Vegas. D.R. Horton also develops Tamarron in Katy Breckenridge Forest in Spring and Lakeshore Villages in Slidell La.

Home sales in the list exceeded expectations in the first half of 2021 with a pace that indicates the potential for a 12 percent increase at year’s end compared with 2020.

“This year has thus far been emblematic of widespread (master-planned community) success and surging new home demand” the report says.

Chicago the most prolific performer in the history of the old Pine Knob staged its 81st performance at the venue to launch a summer concert season truncated by the pandemic. The 2½-hour hits-stocked show was the first music event at the amphitheater since September 2019.

Fans descending onto the venue for the first time in 22 months were greeted with familiar DTE hallmarks — parking-lot tailgaters bustling concession stands the omnipresent scent of roasted almonds — along with some they don't always see like the lush lawn benefiting from its first untrampled summer in five decades.

Nature may have done its thing on the pavilion too: One fan in Row P amusedly reported he had arrived to find cobwebs on his seat.

Guests also encountered some new venue policies including an accelerated move to paperless ticketing and a ban on bags and purses which had many scurrying back to their vehicles to stow the prohibited items. (Venue officials say it’s a COVID-prompted policy meant to cut down on entry congestion by speeding up security checks.)

Onstage keyboardist Robert Lamm trumpeter Lee Loughnane and trombonist James Pankow were once again at the heart of things just as they’ve been since the group’s Chicago Transit Authority days.

With their latest crew of players they served up a journey through their five decades of sounds — the punchy subtly intricate stuff from the turn of the ‘70s the middle-of-the-road evolution that followed the synth-steeped ‘80s ballads.

Recent enlistee Neil Donell a generously ranged singer now managing Peter Cetera’s original parts proved to be a strong addition with the hit 1984 ballad “You’re the Inspiration” earmarked as a spotlight moment.

The hits came bouncy (“Saturday in the Park” “Does Anybody Really Know What Time it Is?”) breezy (“Call on Me” “Just You ‘n’ Me”) and tender (“If You Leave Me Now” “Hard to Say I’m Sorry”) in a hardworking show laced with jazzy breaks and stacked vocal harmonies.

The lengthy “evening with” performance aimed to showcase most of Chicago's notable hits which led to the occasional fizzle — like a formless “Hard Habit to Break” in the show’s second half. Still the dozen-strong ensemble was well-oiled and all-in with the musical workouts that marked segments such as the lengthy ""Ballet for a Girl in Buchannon.”

That seven-part piece was followed by a 20-minute intermission when DTE’s video screens flashed a message of thanks to essential workers for “getting us back to live music.”

Chicago was among the myriad artists that postponed tours in 2020 — but it's been one of the earliest out of the gate this summer. The group has been touring since June busy reopening venues across the country as it did Sunday in Clarkston.

The pandemic downtime was noted onstage at DTE more than once.

Late in the show Pankow acknowledged it had been a tough year for everyone.

“There’s no better medicine than this music” he said.

Thousands of DTE Energy customers in Oakland County and the village of Armada in Macomb County remain without power following severe storms and a tornado Saturday night.

DTE reported nearly 73000 customers were without power early Monday due to wind damage. Outages were widespread in Oakland County from West 12 Mile north to South Fenton Road including Clyde Wolverine Lake and Walled Lake.

About 445 customers in and around the village of Armada were still without power Sunday night after an EF-1 tornado with winds up to 105 mph touched down and left a trail of damage.

Consumers Energy reported more than 1200 customers without power throughout its coverage area early Monday.

DTE had 1413 crews in the field and ""will be working around the clock to restore power to impacted customers as quickly and safely as possible"" according to its website.

Oakland County activated its severe weather sirens at 7:58 p.m. Saturday after receiving a tornado warning notice from the National Weather Service. Radar indicated a tornado was near Clarkston moving east.

Oakland County Emergency Management received reports of structural damage to homes and businesses as well as flooding and blocked roads.

“We are continuing to monitor the situation to support the safety of all residents in Oakland County” County Executive Dave Coulter said in a statement late Saturday. “We urge all residents to report downed wires and stay away from standing water.”

Outages and downed lines can be reported to DTE at outage.dteenergy.com with the DTE Energy Mobile app or at 1-800-477-4747.

Macomb County officials plan to give an update today on the damage caused by a severe thunderstorm that swept its way through the area Saturday night including a likely tornado that struck downtown Armada.

A 1 p.m. news conference has been called that will include County Executive Mark Hackel along with Sheriff Anthony Wickersham and Brandon Lewis the county’s emergency manager.

The storm that roared its way through Macomb County Saturday evening caused substantial damage in downtown Armada where a tornado may have roared through town. It produced reports of wind damage along with power outages in addition to heavy rainfall and numerous lightning strikes.

The National Weather Service reporting station in White Lake located in northwestern Oakland County plans to survey the scene this afternoon in an effort to confirm a tornado may have touched down in the village of Armada around 7:45 p.m. Saturday.

“We have high confidence it was a tornado in Armada based on the radar images and damage reports we’ve received so far” said meteorologist Trent Frey. “Our team is headed to Armada right now so we should have some more information this afternoon.”

Meanwhile there are about 8500 homes and businesses with no electricity in Macomb County according to DTE Energy’s online outage map.

Outages are reported in the Armada/Romeo area as well around the area of 16 Mile Road and Groesbeck Highway in Clinton Township the 18 Mile and Ryan roads area of Sterling Heights and near 14 Mile Road between Utica and Garfield roads in Fraser.

DTE Energy has crews working to repair the numerous downed wires and trees resting on power lines but no service restoration times were immediately available the utility said.

Lewis the county Emergency Management director said he was working to confirm the touchdown at 8:50 p.m. Saturday. Hackel who said he drove from his home to the Armada area to assist with any cleanup reported at 8:15 p.m. substantial damage as sunshine came out following storm clouds that had just passed.

“There’s some significant damage and now it’s just eerie” Hackel said.

Much of the southeastern area of Michigan including Macomb County was under a severe thunderstorm watch Saturday afternoon and into the evening. A tornado warning that had been issued for the county expired was dropped about 8:20 p.m.

DTE Energy’s power outage map showed more than 2000 homes and businesses were without electricity in the village of Armada and the surrounding township. The map showed the bulk of the outages were from about 32 Mile to Bordman roads and Deland to Romeo Plank roads.

Elsewhere there were about 3000 outages reported in Sterling Heights in the 18 Mile Road area from Mound to Dequindre roads. And in Fraser about 200 utility customers were without power north of 14 Mile Road between Utica and Garfield roads.

Wind damage was reported to be the cause of the outages according to information embedded in the maps. There is no estimated time for restoration of services as about 10 p.m. Saturday.

One minor injury and no deaths are reported from tornadoes that caused significant damage this weekend in Armada White Lake and nearby communities authorities say.

Toppled trees cut electric lines and fell on homes commercial buildings vehicles and a camping trailer at Pontiac Lake Recreation Area in White Lake. Vicious winds also flipped vehicles and ripped into a Salvation Army thrift store on Highland Road in that community.

Wolverine Lake and Walled Lake also lost towering trees.

A separate tornado at same time caused damage to the east in Armada a Macomb County township where winds were estimated to reach 105 mph. A third twister touched down west of Flint.

► See photos below including one from Southfield.

Both Metro Detroit whirlwinds classified Sunday afternoon as EF-1 tornadoes by the National Weather Service touched down at 7:54 p.m. The White Lake's first point of impact was just west of Teggerdine and Pontiac Lake roads in the western Oakland township. It raced toward Clarkston at about 100 mph before losing tornado-level velocity about three minutes later the service says.

Destruction includes ""roof damage garage damage ... and numerous healthy trees uprooted and snapped"" the federal meteorologists post.

A house was dagamed when multiple pine trees fell on it resulting in one minor injury.

Macomb's simulataneous touchdown came at 34 Mile and Armada Ridge Road five miles east of Romeo. The twister ripped through Armada during its 14-minute span causing ""massive tree damage with uprooted and sheared trees"" the weather service says. ""One house lost all roofing with the upper walls then collapsing.

About an hour earlier a similar-strength tornado touched down about 10 miles west of Flint in County according to the federal weather office in White Lake. At least three garages were damaged or wrecked says a damage survey tweeted late Sunday afternoon.

Armada's storm sent large limbs onto a parked vehicle and into yards and parks -- ""significant damage"" says Mark Hackel county executive.

""We're very fortunate there were no reported injuries and no deaths"" he added at a roadside news briefing in Armada. The elected official praised township Fire Chief Chris Krotche's department for swift responses and helping residents out of damaged homes.

DTE Energy reports over 600 downed wires as of Sunday morning affecting 133200 cutsomers.

Production staffers will start showing up a couple of hours later. Fans will roll into the parking lot that afternoon and doors will open at 6 p.m.

And finally at about 7:30 p.m. Chicago will step onto the DTE stage — presumably to a pent-up roar from the crowd — to end a 665-day concert hiatus for America’s most successful summer amphitheater.

In the era of COVID-19 not much is set in stone. But as things stand Chicago’s DTE show marks the opening of the floodgates as concerts return in full force across metro Detroit.

The veteran band with the big brass attack is fitting for the return of DTE which ranked No. 1 nationally in attendance in 2019: Chicago has played the former Pine Knob more than any act in the venue’s history logging 80-plus performances.

“We’ve been working very very hard to get to this moment” said Howard Handler president of 313 Presents which produces and promotes events at DTE and five other major venues. “We can’t wait to open the doors wide.”

Live music never technically stopped during the pandemic. Along with the array of online shows and drive-in events that popped up as a stopgap in 2020 there were scaled-down socially distanced festivals and concerts-in-the-park.

And we’ve already had a taste of bigger stuff in recent weeks including three shows at the Aretha Franklin Amphitheatre country maverick Jamey Johnson’s electric night at Michigan Lottery Amphitheatre and last weekend’s Faster Horses Festival which drew about 40000 to Michigan International Speedway.

But this is the week concerts come back big time.

At Detroit’s big four amphitheaters — DTE Michigan Lottery the Aretha Meadow Brook Amphitheatre — more than 70 shows are on the books through early October. Comerica Park will also be humming with music again and some of the region’s familiar music festivals are on the way.

For a 2½-month stretch there will be a major concert in metro Detroit nearly every night of the week.

""The excitement from the artists and fans is palpable"" said Dave Clark president of Live Nation's Great Lakes Region. ""You could feel it at Faster Horses — I had goosebumps when the artists walked onstage and heard the roar of the crowd. It’s something you can’t duplicate. That relationship is something so unique and special.""

The indoor action is revving up again too: Club calendars are heavily stocked with shows by both local and touring acts while midsized venues will soon welcome music again including rooms such as Royal Oak Music Theatre (Tanya Tucker Aug. 11) the Fox Theatre (Il Divo Sept. 9) and the Fillmore Detroit (State Champs Sept. 19).

At Little Caesars Arena a busy stretch of shows is lined up starting with Yo Gotti’s CMG Takeover on Aug. 28.

Notably more than 16 months after COVID-19 hit nearly every live-music spot in Michigan is intact — not what many would have predicted in March 2020 if they had known venues would be dark for a year-plus. Clubs in Warren (Hot Rock Bar) and Lansing (the Loft) announced permanent closures but the scene is otherwise resurrecting to its pre-pandemic state.

“It’s great because that’s definitely not the case in other states” said Nate Dorough of Audiotree Presents a concert promoter closely involved with the new National Independent Venues Association (NIVA).

NIVA hastily formed in spring 2020 by onetime competitors spearheaded efforts at state and federal levels to secure a lifeline for imperiled venues. In Michigan that led to $3.4 million in state-funded emergency grants which were distributed to more than 100 venues and promoters earlier this year.

Nationally the $16 billion Shuttered Venue Operators Grant — described by some as the biggest single instance of arts funding in world history — has begun to pay out to thousands of US venues including many in Michigan.

At 313 Presents — which oversees entertainment events at DTE LCA Michigan Lottery Meadow Brook the Fox and Comerica — Handler said his team has stayed in “constant communication” with health officials and others in the industry as it navigated the pandemic downtime. With so many unknowns as the months unfolded the concert schedule was a fluid ever-changing chess game.

“Back in February we thought September 1 was going to be the date to be honest” Handler said. “Things started to percolate as the vaccine rolled out and by April there was a certain amount of critical mass. We’ve been ready to come back for a while and so many artists were itching to get back on the road. That’s what they do. That’s who they are.”

The coming weeks are heavy on country artists who were the first to get out of the gate as touring came back to life. Brian O’Connell head of Live Nation’s country division said it was natural for Nashville’s performers and crews to quickly step on the gas.

“We’re nimble we’re in one place and the production doesn’t need 16 months of planning” O’Connell said. “When it was safe and deemed appropriate to do it we were coming.”

As DTE Energy Music Theatre resumes operations concertgoers will encounter some new developments: To speed up entry times the venue has enacted a no-bag policy eliminating part of the security checks at gates. Wallet-sized pouches small purses and medical bags are still allowed.

Like many venues in the business it’s also moving toward an all-digital ticketing system — your pass is on your mobile device — although with many fans still holding printed tickets from more than a year ago it’s not 100% yet.

DTE’s VIP space the Ivy Lounge has been upgraded including a new entrance direct from the parking lot.

And in a significant move on the sponsorship front the venue has its first cannabis partner. Troy-based Lume which operates dispensaries across the state signed a five-year deal that will call for branding throughout the amphitheater and a 6000-square-foot “Tree House” lounge by DTE’s west entrance. (Cannabis sales and consumption remain barred on the premises.)

Handler said 313’s venues are in good shape with staffing — something that has been a hurdle for many other part-time and summer employers amid the pandemic. But jobs remain available and those interested can visit ilitchcompanies.com to apply.

The Aretha on Detroit’s riverfront has also issued a callout for seasonal staffing and applications can be submitted at thearetha.com.

While many of the coming shows have been on sale for months — some even for nearly two years — fans have a chance to grab last-minute seats for $20 and no service fees as part of a US-wide Live Nation promotion.

The $20 deal which will start at noon Wednesday and run while tickets last includes 35 shows at 313 Presents’ local amphitheaters with dates such as the Black Crowes (Thursday) James Taylor-Jackson Browne (Aug. 1) the Counting Crows (Aug. 15) and Boyz II Men (Aug. 26).

The list of eligible $20 shows can be found at 313Presents.com.

“Live music at our amphitheaters is one of the rites of summer for Detroiters. And Detroiters are some of the best music fans in the world"" said Handler a metro Detroit native who was named 313 Presents president in late 2019. ""I’ve been everywhere — there’s just nothing like a Detroit audience. And we’re thrilled to welcome people back.”

By Michael Alden

Gov. Ron DeSantis appointed Lauran Monbarren the daughter of Florida Senate President Wilton Simpson R-Trilby to the USF Board of Trustees on Friday.

Monbarren will be the fourth new appointment of the year to the 13-member board continuing a shakeup that started in January. Her appointment follows the confirmation of former House Speaker Will Weatherford on June 8 as chairman of the board of trustees.

In the announcement from the governor’s office Monbarren is cited as the chief financial officer and vice president of Simpson Environmental Services and Simpson Farms.

Previously she was an administrator at Pasco-Hernando State College and taught in the Pasco County School District. Monbarren holds a bachelor’s degree in elementary education and a master’s degree in education from Saint Leo University.

Her father Wilton Simpson is a Republican who has served in the Senate since 2012 and represents District 10 which includes Citrus Hernando and part of Pasco County. He was elected Senate president on Nov. 12 2020 for the 2020-2022 Legislature.

Monbarren replaces longtime trustee Jordan Zimmerman effective immediately.

The governor appoints six of the USF trustees and the Board of Governors appoints five. The presidents of the USF Faculty Senate and Student Government are also trustees. All appointees must be approved by the Florida Senate.

In January two other new members were approved to the board: Melissa Seixas an executive at Duke Energy Florida and Shilen Patel the CEO and founder of a health care technology services firm.

The four new appointments and shakeup of the board come after grumbling by key Pinellas County elected officials about the way USF leaders have handled consolidation of USF’s three campuses.

State Sen. Jeff Brandes R-St. Petersburg has called out the leadership of USF and said its performance “calls for a deep dive” into the board.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWxhdXJlbG1hZ2F6aW5lLmNvbS9hcnRzLWluLWhpZ2hsYW5kcy1uYy1hbmQtY2FzaGllcnMtbmMvdGhlLWFydC1vZi1sZXNsaWUtamVmZmVyedIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Art of Leslie Jeffery,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJ0b2luc2lkZXIuY29tLzI4MjgxLW92ZXJoZWFyZC1hdC1uYXJ1Yy1zdW1tZXItcG9saWN5LXN1bW1pdC0yMDIxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Overheard at NARUC Summer Policy Summit 2021,"Looking to read the full article?

This is thanks to the brewery that kept it going but it’s also thanks to writers such as Michael Jackson and to U.S. importers who gave it a lifeline when Belgians were drinking very little of it. It helps a lot that it’s a fantastic beer—dry highly drinkable complex and surprisingly hoppy when fresh.

Dupont also is what most influenced Blaugies’ Saison d’Epeautre in character—to us a true classic but this brewery on the French border has really only been around since 1988. Another beauty in this vein worth mentioning—brewed just on the other side of that border and only about seven miles away—is the Cuvée des Jonquilles from Au Baron. Recently more established Belgian breweries have seen that saison can sell and they have brewed examples closer to Dupont’s tradition than anything else. These include lively Saison Surfine from Dubuisson—highly carbonated with meringue-like foam that will remain on Earth long after humans are extinct. Softer but still pleasant examples include St-Feuillien Saison in nearby Le Roeulx and Saison 1858 from du Bocq in Namur province. Also worth noting here is Flemish-brewed tissue-wrapped Saison d’Erpe-Mere from Glazen Toren—stronger and a touch sweeter than Dupont but with extra-lively sparkle that seems to help dry it. These beers are unspiced however spicy they might taste.

However a totally different interpretation is alive and well only about five miles from Dupont and in Dubuisson’s own Pipaix backyard. At the steam-powered relic Brasserie á Vapeur the Saison de Pipaix is tart and spiced with ginger orange peel star anise and lichen. (That’s right: lichen. This beer includes a symbiote.) Out east in Luxembourg province another brewery well-known to American belgophiles follows a similarly wild and woolly path: Fantôme in Soy produces a variable “saison” that tends to be both microbiologically odd and spiced or flavored with various things.",,,,,,,,,,,,

What is your favorite thing about Forest Biomaterials and the College of Natural Resources?

The community! I love the people I work with and the passion they have for their work.

What is your favorite thing about NC State?

I love NC State’s recreation opportunities. NC State is unique to me with the extensive rec center extension forests and outdoor spaces.

What advice would you give to an incoming graduate student?

Know what you want to study before you start! And take a semester or two off between undergrad and grad school if you can manage it. The perspective on your own life that you will build in that time apart from educational institutions is invaluable.

What has been your biggest challenge as a graduate student?

My biggest challenge has been keeping a good perspective on long-term goals. Graduate school is a very different experience than undergrad – there is essentially unending constant work; no respite on weekends or vacations. It’s easy to focus on the short term and the fast pace of work. I’ve had to square the reality that the road to a Ph.D. is a long one—also COVID.

Outside of your studies what do you enjoy doing?

I enjoy exercising playing music riding my motorcycle and generally being outdoors.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Olympics.com: How much do you think today helped to validate the sport?

Jagger Eaton: I feel like having all these eyes on skateboarding for the first time and being able to see how much fun we're all having and there like how much fun and how competitive it can all be. And I feel like that's a huge thing that people need to understand is that skateboarding is so fun. And even through all the countries all my competitors Yuto and Kelvyn we're all still friends. ... it's just a really family vibe.

Olympics.com: What does this mean to you?

Eaton: Skateboarding just makes me happy. That's the simplest way I can put it is out there being in that atmosphere being able to be competitive. I'm just so happy. I'm just fulfilled. And no matter what happened out there no matter if I would have ended up last or if I would ended up on the podium I was having a good time. And that's that's really what I feel like I took from today.

Olympics.com: Your parents are both involved in gymnastics. How did that work for you coming from a sporting family like that into skateboarding?

Eaton: Growing up in a gymnastics family I didn't get a skateboard until I was four years old and both my brother and I started it. And yeah I mean I just grew up on trampolines and rod floors and being around really competitive hard-working people. And you know that's kind of what my parents did with skateboarding with me. They knew what it took to be great. They knew what it took to compete at this level in gymnastics and they just applied to skateboarding. And that's really why I'm here is because of their sacrifice of being able to do that for me. And they were working 12-hour days coaching gymnastics while I was skating 12 hours having a blast. So I'll never be able to thank them all for that. Wow.

Olympics.com: And now that the gymnastics is on do you watch it? Are you rooting for anyone?

Eaton: Oh we always love watching gymnastics. That's kind of a whole summer event for us especially when the Olympics are on. I mean we always watch gymnastics but again I mean we're always blown away by Simone [Biles].",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlYW11c2EuY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMS9qdWx5LzI1L291dC1vZi10aGUtc2hhZG93cy1qYWdnZXItZWF0b24taXMtdGVhbS11c2FzLWZpcnN0LXNrYXRlYm9hcmRpbmctbWVkYWxpc3TSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Out Of The Shadows Jagger Eaton Is Team USA's First Skateboarding Medalist,"Jagger Eaton celebrates on the podium during the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 on July 25 2021 in Tokyo.

Jagger Eaton has been living in a large shadow on the men’s street skateboarding circuit. Now Eaton has a historic claim to fame: He is the first American to win an Olympic skateboarding medal.

The 20-year-old from Mesa Arizona finished third Sunday at the Tokyo Olympics — where skateboarding is making its debut — in the men’s street final the first event of this discipline at Ariake Urban Sports Park in Tokyo.

Japan’s Yuto Horigome the reigning world champion earned his country’s third gold medal of these Olympics with a score of 37.18. Brazil’s Kelvin Hoefler won the silver with 36.15 and Eaton the bronze at 35.35. Eaton was coming off a fourth-place finish at this year’s world championships.

Nyjah Huston a 26-year-old Californian who entered the Olympics as the favorite finished seventh with 26.10. A six-time world champion and 10-time X Games champ Huston misfired on his final four tricks in the “best trick” portion of the contest.

The two Americans qualified for the final in fine form with Eaton dominating his heat and earning the No. 2 slot and Huston one spot behind him.

After the two 45-second runs under the hot early-afternoon sun in the finals Eaton was second and Huston third increasing the hopes of both Americans medaling. The competition then moved to the best trick where each rider got five attempts. Of their seven runs the best four count toward the final scores.

Huston got a 9.09 for his first trick while Eaton took a zero. From there their fortunes reversed. While Huston didn’t complete another trick Eaton put himself in line for a medal when he scored an 8.70 on his second trick and a 9.40 on his third the second-highest score of the day. Eaton didn’t land either of his last two tricks.

Possibly feeling the pressure of needing a big score seven of the eight competitors took zeroes on their second tricks with only Eaton not falling.

After missing his second to last trick Huston let out an audible groan before saluting the small but enthusiastic crowd of officials in the venue. Among those in attendance Sunday was skateboard legend Tony Hawk.

Olympic viewers are sharing their praise and admiration for US skateboarder Jagger Eaton after he secured a bronze medal while listening to music through his AirPods at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.

On Sunday the 20-year-old made history when he became one of the first Olympic medallists in skateboarding after the sport made its debut at this year’s Games.

However while Eaton’s performance was Olympic-medal worthy placing him in third after silver-medallist Kelvin Hoefler of Brazil and gold-medallist Yuto Horigome of Japan many viewers watching at home were most impressed by his ability to skateboard while keeping his AirPods in.

“Jagger Eaton deserves the gold medal just for keeping his AirPods in for the whole run. #Olympics” one person joked.

Another said: “Jagger Eaton competing in the #Olympics with AirPods in his ears is such a vibe. #Tokyo2020 #TeamUSA.”

“Jagger Eaton skating with his AirPods in and finishing his heat in first place… legend behaviour” someone else tweeted.

Fans were even entertained when the skateboarder lost an AirPod during one trick with one tweet acknowledging how “crazy” it was to see Eaton look for the headphones after messing up a trick.

“Jagger Eaton LOOKING FOR HIS AIRPODS after messing up a trick is crazy” they wrote. “Olympic skateboarding is weird.”

Eaton’s performance also prompted many viewers to express curiosity about the Olympian’s playlist with numerous people wondering what Eaton was listening to while skateboarding.

“I need to know what Jagger Eaton is vibing to on his AirPods” one person tweeted while another asked: “Is anyone else insanely curious what Jagger Eaton is listening to in those AirPods? #TeamUSA #Olympics.”

While Eaton has not yet shared what songs he listened to during the Olympic course the social media curiosity prompted Arizona 12News anchor Mitch Carr to reveal on Twitter that he’d previously asked the athlete a similar question during an interview that took place last month and that the 20-year-old had said he listens to is “a little bit of old country and rap” before he competes.

“The music I listen to before I compete is a little bit of old country and rap” Eaton said before explaining that the unique mix comes from his “roots” because he “grew up on all the old country artists and as far as new rap that’s just a part of my life I guess of just being in skateboarding”.

Following his medal win fellow Olympian Shaun White offered his congratulations to the skateboarder with the snowboarder tweeting: “Congratulations to Jagger Eaton on being the first American Olympic medallist in skateboarding history!!

Jagger 20 of Mesa Arizona won the bronze in the men's street event as skateboarding made its Olympic debut.

Eaton posted a final round score of 35.35 0.8 behind the 36.15 points by Brazil's Kelvin Hoefler. Yuto Horigome of Japan gave the host nation the honor of winning the first gold medal presented in the sport by scoring 37.18.

After he made it to the podium skating legend Hawk discussed having his sport enter the games.

He said: 'It's exciting. I know there's some people saying that it doesn't belong here but it's not like the Olympics are inventing a competition for us (skateboarders).

'I've been competing since I was 10 years old. Competition has always been a big part of skateboarding and I think now this is going to expose it to a whole new audience and probably get countries to embrace it that have probably discouraged it in the past.

'Considering that snowboarding has been in the Olympics since 1998 I'm surprised it took this long for them to figure it out.

Team USA star Jagger Eaton has left viewers impressed after skateboarding with his AirPods in

'I believe they needed a youthful energy to the summer games and it's overdue. Now with this surfing and sport climbing they're gonna have it.'

Eaton who has suffered injuries common with his sport said he had achieved his lifelong ambition to skateboard at the Olympics after he began at the age of four.

His brothers Jett and Koston are also competitive skateboarders.

He and his siblings are all named after famous people including older brother Jett named after Joan Jett] younger brother Koston after skateboarder Eric Koston and his other siblings are called Bowie and Hendrix.

'I don't think my parents wanted any of us to be rock stars they just love music. Their first date was at a Rolling Stones concert.'

In his youth Jagger tried playing the guitar but he had already broken both elbows due to skating and couldn't hold it properly.

'My dad was always okay with the risk of getting hurt but my mum's been through some stuff with us. Having eight broken bones before I was 13 - my mum had to deal with that.'

His grandfather Mark 'Stormy' Eaton competed in gymnastics trampoline at international level and won a silver medal in the individual event at the world championships in 1971.

He missed the 2019 World Championships in Sao Paulo Brazil due to an ankle injury and the same year he suffered a broken collarbone while snowboarding and was unable to train or compete for six weeks.

Eaton set the initial score to beat in the prelims during the sport's maiden year at the Olympics

'It's exciting' he said. 'Considering that snowboarding has been in the Olympics since 1998 I'm surprised it took this long for them to figure it out'

He spent his childhood skating at his parents' Kids That Rip skatepark in Mesa.

'That's when I realized I wanted to skate for the rest of my life. I started getting good and I was having so much fun. My dad showed me everything about skateboarding. I loved it from the very beginning.'

'I started off with that run and I was a little shaky. I felt it just with the heat and everything a little bit. I'm sure everybody saw it but I was just into my music and just having such a good time. I'm just so pumped. Let's go USA. Let's go.'

He said of winning the bronze: ''I'm shaking right now. I can't even talk. I'm about to cry. It's a huge accomplishment for me and a goal I've had since I was a kid growing up. I can't even make words right now.'

'Seven or eight years of work went into this. I only knew the Olympic dream about three years ago. I dreamed of just making it. I competed in my last contest to make it here on a broken ankle. I'm taking medication right now to get me through this pain.

'And the fact I just got on the podium with these boys here who I respect and care about so much it's an amazing situation.

'I cope with the pain by going out and skateboarding. I've been through pain a lot.'"

'I was about to eat it but I thought I better save it for later' Rylee told 9News.

Then after checking the auction she said she was shocked.

'I saw $10000 and I like screamed' she said.

Though who is entitled to the windfall is a matter for debate.

Wacky food items selling for thousands on the eBay are a pretty common phenomenon.

Echoing the time that air from the Yeezus tour attracted bids of $60000 in 2015 the sale quite literally consists of a clear plastic bag labelled “Air from Donda Drop”. The image also shows it being held up in front of the vast white stage where Kanye “performed” proving it’s the real deal.

Campos-Oriola joined from Ubisoft Montreal where he was previously the creative director for online brawler For Honor. Before that he was lead designer for Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon: Future Soldier (2012) and Red Steel 1 and 2 (2006 2010).

“I’d never had the opportunity to work on a survival horror game which is one of my favourite genres as a gamer. So the opportunity to work on Dead Space was like ‘Yes you can stop talking I’m on my way’” he said of joining Motive.

The art director in charge of the Dead Space remake’s visual direction is Mike Yazijian. Yazijian actually worked on the art for Dead Space 2 as part of Visceral’s now-closed Montreal division. He was most recently art director for Star Wars Squadrons and Batman Arkham Origins.

“I actually found my old notebooks from Dead Space 2!” he said. “So that really comes in handy seeing all the notes from the sequel everything the Visceral team had shared with us as we were making the game with them. We’ve got concept art visual guidelines source materials notes on the conversations we had with them the knowledge that they gained — it’s all here. It’s all going into this game.”

Another developer who worked on the original Dead Space former UX director Dino Ignacio has confirmed he’s consulting EA Motive on the game’s direction and claimed that the game will be “a full on remake” and not just a remaster.

Gary Stewart a former BioWare level designer who worked on every Mass Effect game since 2 is leading level design for the Dead Space remake.

The game director behind Ubisoft’s Assassin’s Creed Valhalla Eric Baptizat joined Motive earlier this year. However it’s not clear what project he’s working on and he is yet to comment publicly following Dead Space’s announcement.

UPDATE: Assassin’s Creed Valhalla’s game director has confirmed he’s taken on the same role for EA’s Dead Space remake.

ORIGINAL STORY CONTINUES: Leads from the original Dead Space who almost certainly won’t be involved in the remake are those currently attached to the Striking Distance studio. Striking Distance is working on its own sci-fi horror game The Callisto Protocol helmed by Dead Space creator Glen Schofield and chief development officer Steve Papoutsis.

Motive currently has more than 25 open positions covering all disciplines though it’s not clear how many of them are for Dead Space. The studio previously said it would work on multiple projects following the completion of Star Wars Squadrons.

The Japanese mark Konami has announced that will delete of the market the famous Pro Evolution Soccer (PES). From the next delivery which corresponds to the campaign 2021-22 will happen to designate 'eFootball'. A radical change that supposes the end of an era.

Although the change of name means a big impact this will not be the only change. The video game will leave to commercialise like physical game and will sell only on-line in format free to play. However no all are bad news: they will keep the agreements with clubs of the size of the FC Barcelona the Bayern Munich the Juventus of Turín the Manchester United or the Arsenal.

Cancelled by the FIFA

The stray battle against the FIFA of Electronic Arts Sports is the main reason of this step backwards of the PES. His competitor possesses the majority of the licences of the football (competitions clubs players marks…) and in the last years have known to explode the virtual competitions like the Ultimate Team.

This defeat reflects besides in economic terms. EA Finished 2020 with a net profit of 3.039 million dollars. Whereas by part of Konami the numbers are not so optimistic. From 2019 his profits have gone in decline. They finished 2020 with 1538 million euros. The electronic game evolves of a less swift way and at present contributes 60% of the total turnover.

I hammered a key piece in the project

Gerard Hammered created a company efootball.pro in 2017 with the aim to create a virtual league between different clubs that have agreement with Konami and the Pro Evolution Soccer. Now the Japanese mark that dispenses of the traditional name of the video game want to promote the game and the on-line parties.

The circumstances have carried that the competition created by the central of the Barça have an important weight inside the company of Konami. The Japanese are betting by the on-line game and the only competitions to compete him to FIFA the hegemony of the world of the simulators of football.",,,,,,

Patricia ""Patti"" Stowe Steely

Houston - Patricia ""Patti"" Stowe Steely of Houston Texas passed away on Wednesday the 21st of July 2021 peacefully in her home. She was 64 years of age.

Patti was born in Little Rock Arkansas on the 20th of August 1956 to James and Mozel Stowe.

Her friendly and vibrant personality added much life to the people she was around. She never knew a stranger a trail of friends were left everywhere she went due to her warm and welcoming demeanor. She was the most devoted mother and even more devoted ""Ya-Ya."" Words truly cannot do justice to the love that she had for her family. Patti was generous loving and outgoing. She loved holidays birthdays and any chance to celebrate others. She made a habit of giving extravagant and thoughtful gifts never wanting anything in return. Patti enjoyed traveling with her friends and family. She was always the first to schedule and talk about the next big trip!

Patti graduated from the University of Oklahoma with a Bachelors of Business Administration. She worked in the Energy Industry for over 40 years. Patti held various managerial positions in the Land Department during 25+ years with EOG Resources; was well respected and mentored many. For many years she was a member of the University Of Oklahoma Energy Management Board Of Advisors.

She was a die-hard Sooner Football fan and rarely missed a game day. Between Norman trips and watch parties she loved to host and socialize at every opportunity. Often times she would invite her LSU family over promising to feed them and watch their game after they watched her OU game.

Patti is preceded in death by her parents James J. Stowe and Mozel; her grandparents; and numerous aunts and uncles. She is survived by her children Adrian Waltmon and her husband Matthew of Houston Graham Steely and his wife Daryl of San Antonio; her twin sister Pamela McClellan and her husband Jim of Fritch Texas; and her brother Jim Stowe and his wife Pat of Edmond Oklahoma. She is also survived by numerous nieces nephews and extended family. Most importantly she is survived by her biggest treasures her grandchildren Emma James and Collins.

Patti believed life is full of choices and she always chose happy.

A memorial service and celebration of her life is to be conducted at ten o'clock in the morning on Tuesday the 27th of July in the Jasek Chapel of Geo. H. Lewis & Sons 1010 Bering Drive in Houston.

Immediately following all are invited to greet the family and share memories during a reception in the adjacent grand foyer.

In this post I'll explain why your FICO score is so important how it's calculated and how you can learn what it is by taking advantage of the rapidly expanding list of credit cards that will tell you your score for free.

For more TPG news delivered each morning to your inbox sign up for our daily newsletter.

Your FICO score is instrumental in how financial institutions view your creditworthiness.

What are the different kinds of credit scores?

While there was originally only one FICO score companies have developed different ways to measure your creditworthiness as time has passed. These include the FICO score 8 or 9 as well as the VantageScore 3.0 and 4.0.

There are several differences between the two methods. The FICO scores 8 and 9 offer slightly different scores for each of the three major credit bureaus while VantageScore offers a single number for all three bureaus. Other differences include importance given to bills sent to collection credit utilization and hard inquiries.

Importance of the FICO credit score

Your FICO score (a product of the Fair Isaac Corporation) is the foundation of most financial transactions you make. If you want a loan at competitive interest rates be approved for a credit card or pass a background check you need to have an acceptable FICO score. Knowing your score can help you anticipate what to expect from these kinds of transactions.

Your FICO score isn't static. It evolves with your finances and you can improve (or damage) it depending on your degree of fiscal responsibility. That's important because it means you can cultivate a high score over time with good financial habits even if you have bad credit (or no credit). Your FICO score allows you to track the state of your finances and can alert you to any problems such as a missed payment or identity theft.

Related: Which budgeting technique is right for you?

Knowing your FICO score is helpful when it comes to travel rewards because it can give you a sense of which credit cards you're likely to be approved for allowing you to maximize your applications.

The FICO formula is kept private but we know the factors that affect your score. (Image courtesy of Shutterstock)

How your FICO score is determined

TPG has written previously about how your FICO score is compiled; here's a brief refresher:

35% payment history

30% amounts owed

15% length of credit history

10% new credit

10% types of credit

The factors that affect your score the most are late or missed payments and your credit utilization — also known as the ratio of how much credit you're using to how much credit is available to you.

Length of credit history also affects your score so it makes sense to keep your oldest accounts open unless you have a compelling reason to close them. Negative ""remarks"" (like a late payment or accounts in collections) stay on your credit report for seven years. That's a long time to pay for a mistake and have it be an obstacle to earning points and miles. Fortunately negative remarks affect your score less and less as they age.

Credit cards that show your score

The good news is that accessing your FICO score for free is now easier than ever thanks in large part to the FICO Score Open Access Program launched by the Fair Isaac Corporation. This program allows credit card issuers that have already purchased the FICO information to share it with customers at no additional charge.

The following credit card issuers now offer your FICO score for free either online or with your monthly statement.

American Express provides its cardholders with not only an educational FICO score but also their Fico Score 8. The latter number is the credit score the issuer uses to manage cardmembers' accounts and is based on data from a major credit-rating agency Experian. Current cardholders can log into their accounts and access their score through account services.

Industry veteran Wong Ka Vin leads Data Center First as co-founder and chief executive of the venture which represents Gaw’s first investment in its Asian data centre platform outside of China the private equity firm said in a release.

In addition to the maiden project at Nongsa Digital Park in Batam roughly 30 kilometres (18.6 miles) across the Singapore Strait from the Lion City Gaw will work with Data Center First to originate evaluate and develop projects in Southeast Asia and beyond.

“I am excited to be working with Ka Vin and his team of professionals in creating this data centre operating platform” said president and managing principal Kenneth Gaw. “It signals a key milestone in Gaw Capital Partners’ growth in the data centre industry an industry that enables digital transformation opportunities for organisations globally to continue to grow.”

Southeast Asian Expertise

Gaw plans to increase its regional data centre footprint rapidly through a combination of multiple asset and platform acquisitions a strategy given a boost earlier this month when the firm brought aboard former Keppel Data Centres executive Kok-Chye Ong as managing director and head of internet data centres ex-China.

To maintain that momentum the family run outfit has now tapped Wong whose track record includes building data centre platforms at US giant Equinix Malaysia’s CSF Asia and the 1-Net unit of Singapore’s Mediacorp. While at 1-Net Wong led the construction in Singapore’s Woodlands area of 1-Net North a 30MVA facility which was acquired by Keppel DC REIT in 2019 for S$200.2 million (now $147.2 million).

A computer science graduate of Sheffield Hallam University Wong spent his early career as a marketing director in the telecom division of HP and as senior vice president for business development at ST Telemedia in Singapore.

Batam’s Bit Barn Hotspot

The Straits Times reported last month that 20 data centre operators were considering the possibility of setting up shop at Nongsa Digital Park with at least one sealing the deal after President Joko Widodo designated the campus a special economic zone.

The story identified Data Center First’s Wong as the buyer of 2.75 hectares (6.8 acres) of land at the park to build multiple facilities customised for clients such as banks telecom firms and e-commerce businesses.

Some 25 hectares at the park has been set aside for data centre development in the first phase with room for expansion. Operators told the Straits Times that Batam is attractive because it is relatively sheltered from natural disasters geographically close to Singapore and part of a market of 270 million people.

Building Into a Boom

Gaw’s launch of an APAC data centre platform comes less than two years after the private equity shop announced its entry into the sector in China.

In 2019 Gaw and Beijing-based Centrin Data set up a joint venture that formed the basis for the firm’s first data centre investment fund targeting hyperscale facilities in China. The fund was seeded with a 6400-rack facility built by Centrin in Kunshan a city just outside Shanghai in China’s Jiangsu province.

Last September Gaw announced a $1.3 billion closing for the fund revealing that the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority was the largest backer of the vehicle among several global institutional investors said to have contributed. Gaw planned to use the fresh funding to invest in a portfolio of server facilities in China.

The data centre market in Asia Pacific is predicted to experience a compound annual growth rate of 12.9 percent from 2020 through 2027 when it is expected to reach $59.8 billion in value according to a report last month by Renub Research.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Here's what could help.,"“Nobody likes to use that term redlining but it still exists a little bit” said Frederick Diggs a local realtor who is Black and past president of the Greater Dayton Realtist Association. “We call it something else but it’s redlining bottom line.”

The newspaper’s findings match a data analysis conducted by Reveal the online platform of The Center for Investigative Reporting that found Black applicants in the Dayton metro area in 2016 were 2.1 times as likely to be denied a conventional home mortgage as white applicants even when controlling for applicant’s income loan amount and neighborhood.

The Dayton Daily News Path Forward project investigates the most pressing issues in our community including race and equity. This story digs into the barriers to homeownership that Black and minority residents face solutions local advocates would like to see — or are working on — and what Ohio’s U.S. senators are doing about the issue. Future stories will examine discrimination Black and minority homeowners face in the home appraisal system and stagnant home values in minority neighborhoods.

Building equity in one’s home is the primary way the average American builds wealth said Diggs. But Black homeownership rates have barely budged since it was legal to discriminate against Black people seeking loans and exclude them from many neighborhoods and suburbs.

In 2019 about 42% of Black households in the Dayton metro area owned their home while about 70% of white non-Hispanic households owned their home according to the U.S. Census Bureau. In 1960 about 38% of Black households nationally owned their home according to analysis of census data by the Urban Institute.

Homeownership is viewed by many as the key to closing the large racial wealth gap in the U.S. but the lack of wealth is also a large barrier to homeownership for Black Americans.

According to the 2019 Survey of Consumer Finances by the Federal Reserve the latest data available white families in America have the highest level of median family wealth which includes any property or assets they own at $188200. For Black families their median wealth is $36100 respectively.

In recent months some Washington lawmakers have called for more to be done to increase minority homeownership. At the same time the real estate market is booming in the Dayton region and many markets nationwide. And with sellers receiving so many attractive offers local advocates worry it might allow for more racial discrimination.

Housing discrimination not a thing of the past

In the 1930s federal government surveyors created maps banks used that deemed white neighborhoods desirable for mortgage lending and neighborhoods with high numbers of African Americans or European immigrants especially Jewish people “hazardous” for lending by drawing red lines around those neighborhoods. The Fair Housing Act of 1968 made denying loans systematically to minority neighborhoods illegal. But little has changed advocates say.

“It’s not as overt as it used to be like people making comments to your face or refusing to let you in the door” said Miranda Wilson director of investigations and enforcement at the Miami Valley Fair Housing Center.

All Americans face barriers to homeownership such as a lack of low and moderately priced homes. But Black Americans also face discrimination in appraisals and lending and a myriad of problems related to their lower family wealth according to Adam Blake vice president of housing at County Corp.

Lower incomes and lower wealth means it is harder to save for a down payment. Black Americans often have higher debt-to-income ratios — including twice as much college loan debt according to the Brookings Institution — which can in itself get them denied for a home loan but also affects their credit scores.

Underwriting can be highly subjective Wilson said.

“Underwriting is just kind of a black box that you have no idea what’s happening in that process” she said.

Norman and Zaria Scearce an African American couple are trying to buy a bigger home in Trotwood since their three kids are getting older and they need the extra space. Zaria Scearce works as a branch manager at a bank and Norman Scearce is self-employed as a pastor and house painter. He has a steady and verifiable income but Norman Scearce said he’s had to jump through hoops to prove it to the bank.

Norman Scearce’s student loan lender allowed him to put his student loans into forbearance due to the pandemic but the bank the couple is applying to for a home loan told him to instead put them in an income-based repayment plan. That made his monthly payment zero. Now the bank says his repayment should be at least $5 per month to qualify for the home loan.

“What you told me to do was wrong and it’s the reason we can’t close on our loan. A lot of the issue is the lack of communication and the discretion of the underwriter” he said. “The underwriters get an enormous amount of control over what they say is necessary to approve someone for a loan. And it just should not be.”

Local advocates propose solutions to barriers

Dayton-area housing advocates want to see the local and federal government and lenders make changes that would help all homebuyers but also target minority Americans. Here are some of the proposals they shared with the Dayton Daily News.

Adam Blake County Corp:

More well-funded programs from the federal state or local governments that assist homebuyers and target minority households.

More homebuyer education including in high school.

The Community Reinvestment Act the major way the federal government encourages banks to lend more to low and moderate income communities is five decades old weak and needs an overhaul to meet the needs of minority communities.

Banks should create better lending solutions that acknowledge modern cultural needs such as recognizing that a self-employed person with multiple business ventures is qualified for a home loan even though they don’t have a traditional job.

Local communities should put mechanisms in place such as land trusts to preserve long-term affordability. A land trust owns the land a house is on and establishes affordability requirements that put restrictions on who can buy the house usually based on the owner’s income.

Local governments should provide tax incentives for developers to build in minority neighborhoods and require any housing developers receiving incentives anywhere to include a percentage of affordable units in their project.

Cora Diggs and Frederick Diggs Greater Dayton Realtist Association:

More homebuyer education including in high school.

Better funded and better advertised government down payment assistance programs.

Local governments should incentivize more development in minority neighborhoods.

Miranda Wilson Miami Valley Fair Housing Center:

Create more uniformity in appraisal and lending practices so there is less room for unconscious bias or discrimination.

The federal government should regulate the credit score reporting agencies or create an alternative public credit reporting agency so scores better capture all the details that prove somebody is financeable including paying rent or utilities.

What locals are doing to increase minority homeownership

Unified Power is a new land trust coupled with a real estate investment cooperative that grew out of Co-Op Dayton the same nonprofit that developed the Gem City Market. Unified Power’s goal is to help long-term Dayton community members remain in or return to the area and to promote racial justice and integration in Montgomery County.

“It will prevent people who have lived here for generations (from being) pushed out by gentrification” said Kenya Baker president of Unified Power’s board of directors.

The group hopes to work with single family homes and potentially multifamily homes depending on what a neighborhood needs as well as some commercial development.

Meanwhile Kémo A’akhutera quit flipping houses in the Dayton area because the housing stock is too damaged. Instead he developed Design to Build a cargotecture construction company he hopes will provide high-quality affordable and market-priced housing.

“We want to be able to do something with all these sites where they tore down homes” he said.

Cargotecture retrofits shipping crates to build. A’akhutera said this new way of building houses will allow young professionals to more easily buy a first home and then easily add onto it.

What Dayton’s representatives in D.C. are doing

Ohio’s U.S. Sens. Rob Portman a Republican and Sherrod Brown a Democrat say they are working on the issue of minority homeownership. U.S. Rep. Mike Turner R-Dayton did not return requests for comment.

In March Portman Amy Klobuchar D-Minnesota and Tim Kaine D-Virginia introduced the Housing Supply and Affordability Act which would create a grant program to help localities develop comprehensive housing policy plans.

“Sen. Rob Portman recognizes that the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic has increased the cost of housing in Ohio and cities across the nation. He believes that in order to address this issue you need to look closely at what’s happening at the local level which is why he supports the Housing Supply and Affordability Act — a bipartisan piece of legislation that will provide localities and municipalities with resources to expand the supply of housing and increase affordability” said Emmalee Cioffi a spokesperson for Portman.

Portman also authored the Neighborhood Homes Investment Act which would create a federal tax credit to cover the cost between building or renovating a home in disadvantaged areas and the price at which the home could be sold. Brown’s office said he supports the bill.

A rule established under President Donald Trump’s administration would have allowed banks to fulfill their Community Reinvestment Act responsibility through several large investments or loans instead of many small-dollar loans to individuals. Brown advocated to overturn that rule which was scrapped this month. U.S. bank regulating agencies said they are working jointly to modernize the CRA.

Since Brown became chairman of the Senate Banking Housing and Urban Affairs Committee this year he has held a hearing on the legacy of racial discrimination in housing and several hearings on housing bills including legislation to study the lack of FHA financing for smaller mortgages.

Brown’s office said he agrees with the Biden-Sanders Unity Taskforce recommendation to establish a public credit reporting agency to provide a non-discriminatory credit reporting alternative to the private companies.

The tops were inspired by the actor Jason Sudeikis who wore a sweatshirt with their names on to an event celebrating the second season of his football comedy Ted Lasso on Thursday.

Versions of Sudeikis’s self-made sweatshirt – which bore the names of Marcus Rashford Jadon Sancho and Bukayo Saka – have been selling on Redbubble Etsy and other sites.

The founder of Notjustclothing which describes itself as a social enterprise committed to creating ethical products said he was inspired to produce a version of Sudeikis’s top after seeing it trending on Instagram “but we couldn’t find a link to buy one for ourselves”.

Mike Harding said the company wanted to help people get behind the message and that its web store had sold almost 100 shirts since it started selling them last Friday while traffic to its Etsy page had increased tenfold over the weekend.

”

“T-shirts like this offer everyday fans a way of showing their respect and joining the movement. Anything that helps to spread and raise awareness of the anti-racism message is to be welcomed” he said.

“Professional footballers have worn anti-racism T-shirts as part of initiatives for many years now the reason they continue to do this is because they are effective.”

Matthew Fairchild the founder of another outlet SportsTees4U said “sales are tremendous” with more than 450 shirts sold.

Racist messages were sent to Rashford Sancho and Saka after they missed England’s last three penalties in the shootout defeat against Italy. Saka said he “knew instantly” he would receive racist abuse after missing the spot-kick.

Sudeikis who had previously worn a Gucci jumper featuring the pro-choice logo “My Body My Choice” to the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) awards in the US told British Vogue he made the football sweatshirt himself.

“The idea struck me the day before our show’s premiere” he said.

“I just felt it was necessary to use the platform of our big fancy ‘worldwide premiere’ to try and personify our show’s support of those three young men. Which is why I chose to put their three names on the sweatshirt. The names their parents gave them.”

The T-shirt style featuring bold type names separated by a “&” was created in 2001 by the Amsterdam-based design company Experimental Jetset and has been widely used including for hen dos and celebrations of the cult book A Little Life.

Enis Yasharovski who works for campaign group Show Racism the Red Card said the charity had seen an increase in public engagement since the Euros.

“More individuals have come forward to offer their time or donate money” he said. “And a number of people have set up JustGiving campaigns to undertake personal challenges to help raise funds.”

He said the money raised would be redirected into “anti-racism education delivering workshops for young people across the UK”.

However there was a danger that wearing a T-shirt could show support but not have a bigger impact he added unlike buying clothing from a recognised charity that fights racism.

“The act of buying anti-racism merchandise such as Show Racism the Red Card T-shirts mean that the money raised goes directly towards anti-racism eduction” said Yasharovski.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpcm1pbmdoYW1tYWlsLmNvLnVrL2JsYWNrLWNvdW50cnkvd29sdmVyaGFtcHRvbi13b21hbi1tYWtlcy02MGstc2VsbGluZy0yMTEyOTkzN9IBYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpcm1pbmdoYW1tYWlsLmNvLnVrL2JsYWNrLWNvdW50cnkvd29sdmVyaGFtcHRvbi13b21hbi1tYWtlcy02MGstc2VsbGluZy0yMTEyOTkzNy5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wolverhampton woman sells 20000 funny cards and gifts from spare room in lockdown venture,"Something went wrong please try again later.

A young entrepreneur has revealed how she was able to quit her full-time job after starting her own business during the first lockdown.

Phoebe Munger began selling her cards featuring memorable scenes and quotes from the likes of Friends Gavin and Stacey and Line of Duty in January 2020.

In February this year she was able to quit her Graphic Designer job and focus on her business the Foxy Lemon Co full-time.

She has now surpassed 20000 sales on her Etsy store and has her products in multiple independent shops - including one 150 miles away miles away in Cleethorpes.

The 22-year-old told graduated from BCU in 2019 with a degree in Illustration. During her course she interned with the likes of MoonPig and George at ASDA.

“I started it all off as a hobby. I had a sales job after university which I didn’t enjoy so wanted to focus on something that I liked” she told BlackCountryLive.

“I loved designing greetings cards when I interned with MoonPig and told myself that if they wanted to work with me then I must believe in myself too.

“At first I designed them for fun but people kept asking me if they could buy them so I set up my Etsy shop” she added.

Phoebe sells an average of 40 items per day and in the lead up to Valentines Day earlier this year sold a whopping 200 items in 24 hours.

Cards on the site are priced at £2.99 with prices going up to £16.99 for a tshirt.

She said: “I run the business alone and so at that point I knew I had to quit my full-time job.

“I enjoyed it so much but working for them and myself was just too much.”

Phoebe who lives in Codsall Staffordshire said that people spending more time online during the Coronavirus pandemic helped her business to take off.

“People wanted to send pick-me-up gifts to each other and even though the pandemic was awful it definitely helped with the business.

“It was stressful when deliveries were taking longer than expected during lockdown.

“But I get such lovely reviews and messages from customers which makes all the stresses worthwhile” she said.

Items on offer at the Foxy Lemon Co include tshirts mugs and totebags all adorned with funny quotes and illustrations created by Phoebe.

She said: “I keep an eye on Twitter and what’s trending and then design what I think people will love the most.

“It takes about four hours for me to design something and get it on the site.

“I’ll then go to my printers in Telford the next day to pick up items ready to make up and post out to my customers.”

After the Euros earlier this month Phoebe developed a Jack Grealish range which has been hugely popular with customers.

She also features Love Island stars in her designs.

The business started out as a tiny cardboard box full of cards in her bedroom and has now evolved into filling the spare room at her parent’s house.

Phoebe said: “In six-months or so I’d like to move to my own unit.

“Long term I’d love to be able to employ my Mum and keep the business family lead.

“I’m currently working on Christmas stock to launch in Autumn and am always thinking of new ideas to add to the range.”

The Boeing 737 MAX 8 — the smaller of the two MAX variants currently in service — joined the carrier's domestic fleet on July 16 marking the first of 270 new domestic jets that are slated to be delivered to United over the coming years.

This isn't just any domestic jet though.

It's the first to feature United's newly unveiled ""signature interior"" with seat-back screens larger overhead bins power outlets and other passenger-friendly amenities from nose to tail. All new United planes will be delivered from the factory with the upgraded cabins while existing ones will undergo a comprehensive retrofit program.

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

For now if you're looking for the swankiest domestic experience offered by United you'll want to book on the MAX 8. And once you're booked on Boeing's new (and beleaguered) workhorse here's which seats to pick and which ones to avoid.

If faced with the choice you'll definitely want to snag one of the 16 first-class recliners on the United 737 MAX 8.

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

Seats are spread across four rows in a 2-2 configuration with roughly 37 inches of pitch.

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

Though the ""bones"" of the seat are identical to the new ones you'll find on other domestic UA jets the seats feel more modern thanks to the 13-inch high-definition seat-back monitor and other refined touches like a remote control and relocated power outlet.

Some travelers like sitting in the bulkhead but I'd recommend avoiding row 1 on the United 737 MAX 8. That's because the screens are fixed into the bulkhead wall — if you're really tall or height-challenged you'll need to bend your neck to watch your content.

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

Another drawback to the bulkhead is that there's a built-in airbag in each of the seat belts. Though this feature is designed for your safety the airbag can get uncomfortable after resting on your hips throughout the flight.

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

I'd recommend choosing seats in row 2 or 3 when flying upfront on the 737 MAX 8.

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

Row 4 would be my second-to-last pick. You'll be reclining into the bulkhead wall dividing first class and coach and the proximity to the coach cabin could be bothersome.

United Economy Plus on the Boeing 737 MAX 8

(Screenshot courtesy of United)

The first thing I noticed when boarding United's new MAX is the sheer number of extra-legroom Economy Plus seats.

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

These ""purple seats"" as they're affectionately called by some flight attendants span nine rows in a standard 3-3 configuration.

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

As part of United's five-year plan dubbed ""United Next"" the carrier's investing in growing the proportion of premium seats in its fleet including both first-class and Economy Plus by roughly 75% from 2019 to 2026.

These seats offer an additional three to four inches of pitch compared to regular economy but the actual seats themselves are otherwise identical.

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

Some of the 54 Economy Plus seats are much better than others so let's start with which ones you might want to avoid:

Row seven is the bulkhead. Some people will undoubtedly enjoy these seats — no one reclines into you and the bulkhead wall doesn't extend all the way to the floor so there's ample under-seat storage below the two first-class recliners in front. However two of the biggest drawbacks include immovable armrests and the fact that the seat-back screens swivel out from in between each seat.

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

Row 11 is missing windows. If you're an aviation enthusiast who enjoys staring out the window you'll be disappointed if you end up in Row 11.

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

Row 12 and Row 14 each have just one window compared to the two you'll find in other rows. This isn't a dealbreaker for me but if you're after the perfect wing-view shot you may prefer to sit elsewhere.

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

Row 15 is right in front of the exit row. As such these seats don't recline so I'd recommend steering clear of these six spots.

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

As for where you should sit anywhere else in the Economy Plus section works but I have a strong preference for exit row 21. Here you'll find a total of 38 inches of pitch — eight more than in standard coach — and the seats recline as normal.

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

The only downside is that the window armrest is built into the exit door so it's not nearly as comfortable as those you'll find elsewhere on the jet.

United Economy on the Boeing 737 MAX 8

(Screenshot courtesy of United)

With 96 seats most flyers will end up sitting in the standard economy section. Good thing these are some of the best coach seats in the United fleet.

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

After all you'll find a seat-back monitor large overhead bins power outlets and USB ports available throughout the cabin including in economy.

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

Pitch is roughly 30 inches so it could definitely feel tight depending on your body size.

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

The only seats to avoid in coach are those in the last row 38 due to limited recline. Otherwise the remaining rows are roughly equal.

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

I'd try sitting as close to the front as possible for a faster deplaning experience but otherwise you can't really go wrong with other coach seats.

Bottom line

United's newest jet the Boeing 737 MAX 8 is now flying the friendly skies. With an upgraded onboard experience this is the plane that'll likely win United some awards. While the enhancements span nose to tail all seats aren't created equally.

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

It pays to know where to sit so that you avoid missing window views and instead maximize your legroom.

In first-class you'll find me in row two or three. In Economy Plus I'll be in exit row 21 and in coach I'll choose a seat as close to the front as possible.

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

If you notice that one of my preferred seats is already assigned when booking perhaps we'll be on the same flight.

A planning application has been submitted to develop the Ye Horns Inn site in Goosnargh.

The application includes plans to add three houses and an artisan building and change the use of a micro-brewery to a retail unit following the redevelopment of the pub.

The proposals involve the building of three two-storey dwellings all with five bedrooms and garages.

It is proposed that each dwelling will comprise of an open plan lounge dining room and kitchen area a snug utility room/ boot room and integral double garage and garden store to the ground floor.

The first floor will comprise four double bedrooms of which three will contain en-suites and a separate family bathroom.

The loft space will comprise a master bedroom with an en-suite and the garage will also contain a first-floor level for storage.

The commercial elements of the proposal include the change of use of the micro-brewery to a retail unit.

It is proposed to retain the existing building and it will benefit from small areas of dedicated parking for the building including nine extra spaces being added.

Alterations from the first plan include removing the need for a substantial extension to Ye Horns Inn containing a function room and instead providing this within the existing building.

It is intended that this space will be utilised to serve diners on a day to day basis.

A second alteration is the removal of the consented lodges on the site and addition of an artisan building for multipurpose use.

It is anticipated that the artisan building can be used in isolation to Ye Horns Inn as it is proposed to contain its own bar kitchen WCs and parking facilities however the building will be run in conjunction with Ye Horns Inn to ensure that the two venues can function together.

The agent for the development is PWA Planning.

Click here to support Sludge.

A pro-Israel PAC with ties to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) is spending big to defeat progressive candidate Nina Turner in an Ohio special Democratic primary election for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives representing a safely blue district.

Democratic Majority for Israel (DMFI) has spent $738000 opposing Turner and $203000 supporting her chief opponent Shontel Brown with a large portion of the spending ($351000) going towards producing and airing anti-Turner attack ads and smaller amounts going to digital platform advertising and direct mail pieces.

The primary contest between Turner and Brown to fill the seat vacated by U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Marcia Fudge is the latest high-profile battle between the Democratic establishment and a more left-leaning Democratic coalition exemplified by the members of the so-called Squad and Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaigns. Internal polls from the campaigns suggest that Turner is the favorite but a poll taken by Brown’s campaign while the DMFI ads began airing indicates Turner’s lead may have shrunk.

The two have striking differences when it comes to their policy goals. While Turner’s website names Medicare for All as a main issue Brown’s website says she would vote for Medicare for All if it came up but that she believes a public health care option is the best way to achieve universal health care coverage. On Israel Brown told Jewish Insider she would vote to continue sending the country $3.8 billion in military aid with no conditions while Turner said she supports conditioning the aid to “align with significant advances in human rights.” Brown’s more centrist policy goals have won her the assistance of the corporate influence industry — a recent fundraiser for her campaign was hosted by a raft of lobbyists for companies including ExxonMobil Google Comcast and Pfizer according to the Daily Poster.

Shontel Brown’s media webpage has featured a quote from DMFI President and Treasurer Mark Mellman since at least May more than a month before DMFI began spending in the race. Although it is illegal for campaigns to coordinate with outside spending groups like DMFI Brown’s website also features a red box filled with text that is designed to communicate messaging priorities for outside groups to use in their advertising while not violating the coordination law because the information is available to the general public. Ryan Grim pointed out at The Intercept that the messaging PDF linked in Brown’s red box is named “SB4C Red Box.”

DMFI appears to have pulled directly from Brown’s red box for some of their other materials. In an attack ad it’s airing DMFI displays a HuffPost headline about how she compared voting for Biden to eating a bowl of shit which is the top messaging suggestion in Brown’s red box. Another suggestion from Brown’s red box that Turner voted against the Democratic Party platform at the DNC was used by DMFI in a highly misleading mailer that claims Turner’s vote against the platform means she opposes universal health care and raising the minimum wage. Turner voted against the platform in part because it did not endorse universal health care and in 2016 she was the sponsor of the amendment to the DNC platform that added an endorsement of a $15 minimum wage.

DMFI PAC although a legally independent group is closely tied to the Democratic Party. The vendors employed by the group to execute the expenditures are all companies that work with Democratic Party organizations. For example DMFI’s top vendor for its spending in this race is Sage Media Planning & Placement Inc. which primarily works with the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and its offshoot group End Citizens United. Another DMFI vendor for the race is Trilogy Interactive LLC which works for the DCCC and Senate Majority PAC a super PAC affiliated with Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. Last cycle DMFI PAC received a $120000 donation from CHC Bold PAC the Congressional Hispanic Caucus PAC that is chaired by Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.).

Mellman’s consulting firm The Mellman Group has worked for multiple AIPAC-affiliated organizations including the American Israel Education Foundation and Citizens for a Nuclear Free Iran and has also been employed by major corporations and lobbying groups including Blue Cross Blue Shield PhRMA and Verizon. AIPAC is a lobbying group that was formed in the 1950s to create positive spin for Israel after the Israeli Army massacred dozens of Palestinian civilians in the village of Qibya. Several DMFI board members have previously held positions with AIPAC or its affiliate the American Israel Education Fund including co-chairs Ann Lewis and Todd Richman. The American Israel Education Foundation is a charitable offshoot of AIPAC that organizes fact-finding trips to Israel for members of Congress.

Today DMFI filed its pre-special election report with the FEC revealing for the first time the corporate executives and financiers who have been funding it this year. Here are some of the top donors to DMFI’s non-contribution account since January 1.

Amnon Rodan the former chairman of the multi-level marketing dermatology company Rodan + Fields has been DMFI’s largest donor this year giving the PAC $145000. He is married to billionaire Katie Rodan who co-created the acne management product Proactiv. Amnon is a director of the American Israel Education Fund and a former AIPAC board member.

Stacy Schusterman the chairman of Oklahoma-based oil and gas company Samson Energy has given DMFI $95000 so far this year. Samson Energy currently operates assets in the Denver Julesburg basin in Wyoming where it owns drilling rights to over 70000 acres. Schusterman is a prolific political donor who mainly gives to Democratic politicians and groups but last year she also donated the legal maximum of $5600 to Republicans Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma and Rep. Kay Granger of Texas. Stacy’s mother Lynn Schusterman is worth $3.4 billion according to Forbes. Schusterman has been a major donor to DMFI in previous years as The Intercept recently reported.

Victor Kohn the president of investment company Capital International Inc. donated $50000 to DMFI and the Kohn Family Trust chipped in another $50000. Kohn’s past campaign contributions have primarily gone to Democrats but he has also donated to Republicans including Minority Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.).

Andrew Viterbi is a co-founder of Qualcomm and the owner of Viterbi Group LLC a venture capital firm that invests in emerging wireless communication and network infrastructure companies. He gave DMFI $45000 this year. His son Alan Viterbia also gave the group $45000. Alan is the CEO of Liquid Environmental Solutions and a former vice president of Lockheed Martin.

Barry Porter the co-founder and managing general partner of private equity company Clarity Management donated $45000 to DMFI this year. Companies in the firm’s portfolio include oil and gas company Vaca Energy and copper mining company Skye Minerals Partners.

Alan Levow a board member of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee has given DMFI $45000 this year. Levow is a principal at real estate company Crowne Partners which manages several luxury multi-family housing units throughout the Southeast as well as multiple commercial properties in Florida.

“When we come onshore at Crane we will try to avoid the mangroves because we will be burying the pipes but whatever impact it may have on the mangroves it will be included in the EIA [Environment Impact Assessment]” Krispin said as he responded to a question on the deforestation impacts of the project by Sukanand (only name given) at a public scoping meeting held at the Patentia Primary School.

It was pointed out that pipelines will be laid 12 inches underground following the existing road and canal network with a six-meter buffer zone.

Krispin a project manager with Exxon explained that throughout the project Exxon is hoping that the environmental impact will be minimal.

He related that based on current plans they do not foresee the need to clear large swathes of trees and only a small portion of mangroves will have to be cleared to facilitate a temporary wharf during the construction phase.

“So the Wales district is an old plantation so the line will go through it and there is a certain area we are envisioning the plant to go to and where there are not many trees… We do need to clean out [an entire] area where the temporary material offloading facility will be. We do need to clean off an area but it will be quite minimal” he explained to Stabroek News at the end of the meeting.

It was also pointed out that in the EIA Exxon will indicate the need to remove vegetation but will also make provisions to revegetate or replace the amount of forests removed during the construction period.

Concerns have been raised over the destruction of mangrove forest along the West Bank of Demerara to facilitate development for the oil and gas field. ExxonMobil’s local affiliate Esso Exploration and Production Guyana Limited (EEPGL) which submitted an application to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for environmental authorisation for the project notes in the summary that it entails the construction and operation of a 12-inch pipeline approximately 220 kilometers long from the Liza Phase 1 and Liza Phase 2 Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) vessels in the offshore Stabroek Block to an onshore natural gas liquids (NGL) and natural gas processing plant (NGL Plant) located at Wales. The pipeline is expected to transport up to approximately 50 million standard cubic feet per day (MMSCFD) of dry gas to the Natural Gas Liquid Plant but has a maximum flow of approximately 120 MMSCFD.

Additionally residents were informed that the project site will be located 11 kilometers from Patentia and will be at least one to two miles inland from the Demerara River.

Exxon’s Project Manager explained to residents that a specific location has not been established as yet since they are assessing the topography hydrology and soil type of the land before earmarking the site.

Residents were curious to know of the location and whether they will face any negative impacts after the project is completed.

During the meeting it was disclosed that both the gas to shore plant and the power generation plant will be constructed simultaneously next to each other. However residents were told that EEPGL will only be responsible for the construction of the gas to shore plant while the government will be responsible for the construction and financing of the power generation plant.

Providing clarity on additional questions Krispin spoke of the company’s high standards globally. On this note he said that Exxon has strict waste management policies geared at preventing pollution and contamination of the air.

Sukanand had questioned how the company will monitor leakages gas spills and possible air pollution among other things.

According to Krispin the company will utilise advanced pipeline inspection gauges to monitor the project at all times. This he pointed out will aid in the monitoring and detection of any abnormalities. “We will do everything in our power to design the machinery properly and beyond that we have these things called PIGS [pipeline integrity gadgets] which we send through the pipelines to assess its integrity. We will train personnel to deal with leakages and how to address it if there is any” Krispin stated.

Employment

Meanwhile although the meeting was intended to address potential areas of concern for the environment assessment residents utilised the opportunity to enquire about economic opportunities that will be available to them. They were informed that during the construction phase of the project there will be employment opportunities for close to 300 persons in addition to the need for accommodation food and entertainment spots. The residents were encouraged to sign up with the Centre for Local Business Development to find out more about the opportunities that will be made available.

They were also informed that the Centre will be visiting the area with representatives of their subcontractors to identify the needs and wants for the project.

Residents were also informed that the possibility exists for them to benefit from improved roads in their community since the company will require proper roads to transport materials. However Krispin said that this is a discussion they are yet to have with the government as to who will maintain the road during the course of the project and upgrade in preparation for the construction.

One resident applauded the team for visiting and enlightening the area about the project. He noted that since the announcement of the project no government official had visited and explained what the development entails and how they will be able to benefit.

“Nobody shares in-formation on this project like Exxon. That’s why we want to know exactly so when we leave here we can be able to answer questions if people ask us but the government has not been sharing information. They should have preceded Exxon saying that look these people are going to come and they’re going to talk to you about this. Or prepare us. This is new for us and there won’t be another time like this. We are thankful for this” he stated.

With the impact assessment for the Wales gas-to-shore project imminent the EPA has invited public submissions on the scope of the study for the project which is expected to begin operations in 2024. In a public notice the EPA noted that the project with attendant onshore and offshore components could have possible effects on the environment including impacts to marine water quality air quality marine and terrestrial flora and fauna and socio-economic resources among others As a result it has determined that an EIA must be undertaken before the project is approved.

The planned government-owned power plant is not included in the scope of the project’s application except for its consideration when addressing cumulative impacts for the project.

Persons have until today to send questions or submissions to the EPA so that their concerns may be considered in the EIA.

The EIA and other studies are being funded by EEPGL. They have also selected their own consultants for the project since according to this country’s current EPA Act the contractor has to select the consultant from an EPA-approved list of persons.

The companies working on the EIA are Environmental Resource Management (ERM) Ground Structure Engineering Consultants the University of Guyana Faculty of Earth and Environmental Science Leon Moore Nature Experience E&A Consultants Caribbean Engineering and Management Consultants and internationally-recognised SLR Consulting.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJvaWxpbmdjb2xkLmNvbS5hdS93b29kc2lkZS1iaHAtYXVzc2llLW9pbC1nYXMtaW5zcGlyYXRpb24tb3ItZGVzcGVyYXRpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Woodside + BHP oil & gas: inspiration or desperation?,"Buying BHP’s Australian oil and gas assets could allow Woodside to escape its lost decade but its shareholders and Australian taxpayers should count their fingers after the handshake.

ANALYSIS

If the adage that where there is smoke there is fire applies to oil and gas deals then Woodside and BHP are definitely up to something.

Persistent industry chatter of a Woodside BHP transaction went public this week with a multitude of media reports suggesting various permutations with the common theme that BHP wants out of oil and gas and Woodside is involved.

If BHP has been busy planning an escape from hydrocarbons it may explain the unexpected $US90 million ($123 million) “business development and evaluation expense for Petroleum” revealed in this week’s end of year operational review.

BHP chief executive Mike Henry has consistently talked up the value of BHP’s petroleum division but that is no indication that a sale is a change of heart. It makes as much sense to boost assets you want to keep to assure investors as it does to praise them to attract buyers.

There are three reasons why Henry may want to offload BHP’s oil and gas interests: have a pure-play green(ish) materials business to pitch to investors avoid upcoming massive decommissioning costs and sell out before the hydrocarbon fire sale begins.

A retreat from oil and gas is a logical extension to BHP’s two-year plan to exit thermal coal announced a year ago that may have been left too late to maximise returns.

The torrent of positive PR from this week’s nickel supply deal with Tesla is a more pleasant experience than protests about emissions from Woodside’s Scarborough to Pluto LNG project that BHP has a stake in.

A sale of BHP’s Australian and international petroleum assets priced at $US14 billion ($19.1 billion) by RBC Capital Markets would be an enormous boost to BHP’s coffers already overflowing from the high-margin iron ore wealth it extracts from the Pilbara.

The pure-play miner could then fully decarbonise its operations and supply chain for a completely clean and green offering to investors and customers.

Old assets are a hard sell

However BHP’s most significant petroleum assets in Australia – one-sixth of Woodside-operated North West Shelf and half the Bass Strait operation run by ExxonMobil – are not a buyers delight.

Both assets have a sprawling array of ageing facilities and a limited future.

Production from the North West Shelf dropped seven per cent in the past 12 months and is in terminal decline. Woodside’s CO2-filled Browse fields were to fill the five-train LNG plant near Karratha but the project is unlikely to proceed. Perth Basin gas from Waitsia will provide some help but the WA Government has banned all further export of onshore gas.

In the Bass Strait BHP has to wear half the bill of constant decommissioning for a decade or more starting with 180 wells and ten platforms ordered by offshore safety regulator NOPSEMA.

The Federal Government has closed off the easy outs on decommissioning after being saddled with the up to $1billion cost to clean up the Northern Endeavour.

NOPSEMA is taking action to stop constant delay; new financial assurance and change of control provisions make a sale to a less financially robust buyer difficult; and trailing liabilities keep the seller exposed to decommissioning costs if a later owner folds.

So BHP must find a buyer acceptable to the Federal Government with interest in two assets on opposite ends of the continent with significant near-term cash flows but costly and questionable futures.

Woodside needs something – now!

So why is there talk of Woodside being interested in BHP’s fossil fuel cast-offs?

Chair Richard Goyder has no apparent need to invest in offshore Victoria or double his equity in the North West Shelf.

Few companies in Australia have a more explicit objective than Woodside: develop the Scarborough gas field to an expanded Pluto LNG plant.

The strategic clarity comes from a decade of failure to develop any other viable replacements for already falling North West Shelf production and output from the Pluto field that could come off plateau as early as 2026.

A company with only one option has no choices.

Woodside must jump two hurdles to sanction the $US11.4 billion Scarborough to Pluto project this year: sell down its high equity and get BHP with a 26.5 per cent stake in Scarborough on board.

Last week Woodside launched a sell-down of its 100 per cent interest in Pluto Train 2 and 73.5 per cent share of Scarborough with some sale of Pluto Train 2 equity required for sanction.

However potential buyers will want to know where BHP stands before making a long-term investment.

The miner has been less interested and less hurried about Scarborough than Woodside since early 2019 when Woodside had to fully fund the front-end engineering and design.

Without BHP’s approval Scarborough cannot proceed. That outcome would save the miner about $US1.4 billion and destroy Woodside’s future.

The easy solution for Woodside is to buy BHP out of Scarborough but that is baby steps for BHP escaping oil and gas.

A better outcome for BHP is to agree to sell out of Scarborough only if Woodside buys all its Australian petroleum interests.

Making its Australian assets a job lot may be brutal commercial blackmail by BHP but it could work.

Is a bigger Woodside better?

Credit Suisse head of Australian energy research Saul Kavonic said buying BHP out would allow Woodside to grow realise cost and JV synergies and solidify its balance sheet.

“Woodside is in an advantaged position to acquire BHP Petroleum’s Australian assets given asset knowledge cost and JV synergies pre-emptive rights and limited buyer pool” Kavonic said.

Kavonic said while Woodside would acquire a significant decommissioning liability in the medium term the immediate cash flow boost would help fund the construction of Scarborough and Pluto Train 2. Scarborough revenue would begin to flow before the biggest decommissioning bills came in.

However Kavonic added one requirement for success: Woodside needs to savvily manoeuvre through the negotiation.

BHP’s biggest advantage at the negotiation table is that it can wait and Woodside cannot.

More delays to Scarborough diminish the credibility of the project to potential buyers of both equity and LNG. Additionally the contracts in place to build Scarborough including a specialised pipelay vessel will not last forever before they must be renegotiated and rescheduled.

Should a deal be agreed Woodside is in no position to pay cash to BHP as it already needs to sell down just to afford Scarborough and Pluto Train 2.

One solution floated in The Australian yesterday was that Woodside pays BHP in shares that the miner distributes to its shareholders.

BHP is instantly free of its Australian oil and gas assets and its shareholders add Woodside shares to their portfolio.

Whether the Woodside board which seems unable to manage a chief executive transition wrangles a good deal for existing shareholders will take many years and hindsight to determine.

Will BHP be kept on the decommissioning hook?

What will be clear from day one is that a significant portion of the $52 billion bill to clean up after Australia’s offshore oil and gas producers would be concentrated in one company.

With oil and gas production set to decline over coming decades many pure-play hydrocarbon companies will fail when decommissioning liabilities exceed the value of remaining production.

Under Australian law decommissioning is a joint liability so if one company in a joint venture fails others have to pick up the tab.

The Energy and Resources Law Association earlier this year submitted to a review of decommissioning arrangements that “The Government’s real exposure to risks posed by insolvent titleholders therefore occurs when the titleholders do not include a strong participant.”

If BHP stayed in oil and gas they would likely eventually be the strongest participant in most of their joint ventures on the back of their unique mining revenue.

Legislation before Federal Parliament has trailing liabilities that could as a last resort make BHP liable for the entire cost of decommissioning the North West Shelf and the Bass Strait if all other participants failed in coming decades.

It may be a low probability outcome but given the billions of dollars involved very reassuring for future Australian taxpayers.

The scenario is likely to have occurred to BHP’s lawyers who would prefer arrangements that make such a clawback very difficult.

Should a BHP Woodside deal happen Resources Minister Keith Pitt would be doing future generations a service by insisting on explicit provisions to ensure the taxpayer is no more exposed to offshore decommissioning liability than they are now.

On Friday the S&P 500 index crossed the 4400-mark for the first time while the Dow Jones Industrial Average moved past 35000 and reached a new high. Meanwhile weekly jobless claims increased unexpectedly to around 419000 dampening hopes of labor market recovery.

The airline industry dominated the earnings scene this week with United Airlines reporting results on Tuesday and Southwest Airlines and American Airlines releasing their second-quarter statements on Thursday. Earlier IBM came out with positive numbers for its most recent quarter on Monday. The next day all eyes were on streaming giant Netflix which published mixed results in the after-hours.

Energy firm Kinder Morgan Seagate Technology Verizon soft drink major Coca-Cola and Johnson & Johnson stole the show on Wednesday. Thursday was as busy as usual with the major events being the second-quarter earnings releases of telecom firm AT&T fast-food chain Domino’s Pizza Biogen Abbott Laboratories Intel as well as social networking platforms Twitter and Snap. Schlumberger American Express and Kimberly-Clark reported Friday before the opening bell.

While Lockheed Martin is probably the only major company to report earnings on July 26 the market will be closely following the report of Alphabet on July 27. The Google parent will be joined by gadget giant Apple chipmaker AMD Starbucks and Microsoft in the after-hours. Before the opening bell aviation firm JetBlue and engineering behemoth General Electric are scheduled to report earnings.

The financial releases of Bristol-Myers Squibb aircraft builder Boeing and Ford Motor are the key events slated for July 28. The next day is going to be as hectic when the earnings announcements of e-commerce giant Amazon.com Altria Group Yum! Brands and Merck & Co. are on tap. Procter & Gamble oil giant ExxonMobil and Caterpillar are among the major companies preparing to report on July 30.

In this post I'll explain why your FICO score is so important how it's calculated and how you can learn what it is by taking advantage of the rapidly expanding list of credit cards that will tell you your score for free.

Your FICO score is instrumental in how financial institutions view your creditworthiness.

What are the different kinds of credit scores?

While there was originally only one FICO score companies have developed different ways to measure your creditworthiness as time has passed. These include the FICO score 8 or 9 as well as the VantageScore 3.0 and 4.0.

There are several differences between the two methods. The FICO scores 8 and 9 offer slightly different scores for each of the three major credit bureaus while VantageScore offers a single number for all three bureaus. Other differences include importance given to bills sent to collection credit utilization and hard inquiries.

Importance of the FICO credit score

Your FICO score (a product of the Fair Isaac Corporation) is the foundation of most financial transactions you make. If you want a loan at competitive interest rates be approved for a credit card or pass a background check you need to have an acceptable FICO score. Knowing your score can help you anticipate what to expect from these kinds of transactions.

Your FICO score isn't static. It evolves with your finances and you can improve (or damage) it depending on your degree of fiscal responsibility. That's important because it means you can cultivate a high score over time with good financial habits even if you have bad credit (or no credit). Your FICO score allows you to track the state of your finances and can alert you to any problems such as a missed payment or identity theft.

Knowing your FICO score is helpful when it comes to travel rewards because it can give you a sense of which credit cards you're likely to be approved for allowing you to maximize your applications.

The FICO formula is kept private but we know the factors that affect your score. (Image courtesy of Shutterstock)

How your FICO score is determined

TPG has written previously about how your FICO score is compiled; here's a brief refresher:

35% payment history

30% amounts owed

15% length of credit history

10% new credit

10% types of credit

The factors that affect your score the most are late or missed payments and your credit utilization — also known as the ratio of how much credit you're using to how much credit is available to you.

Length of credit history also affects your score so it makes sense to keep your oldest accounts open unless you have a compelling reason to close them. Negative ""remarks"" (like a late payment or accounts in collections) stay on your credit report for seven years. That's a long time to pay for a mistake and have it be an obstacle to earning points and miles. Fortunately negative remarks affect your score less and less as they age.

Credit cards that show your score

The good news is that accessing your FICO score for free is now easier than ever thanks in large part to the FICO Score Open Access Program launched by the Fair Isaac Corporation. This program allows credit card issuers that have already purchased the FICO information to share it with customers at no additional charge.

The following credit card issuers now offer your FICO score for free either online or with your monthly statement.

Associated Press

Blaine Minn. — The third round of the 3M Open was filled with shots into the rough and the water around the 18th green and sometimes both.

Cameron Tringale stayed out of trouble that so many others didn’t Saturday – and took the lead into the final round.

Tringale made a short par putt on the treacherous par-5 18th hole for a 5-under 66 and a one-stroke advantage over Gary Woodland and Maverick McNealy.

“I drove it pretty well and gave myself some looks that I capitalized on” said Tringale who is winless on the PGA Tour. “I really just saved my tail quite a few times with the putter.”

Brian Stuard (Jackson) shot a 70 and was at 9 under ties for 12th.

Tringale who tied for third last year at the TPC Twin Cities eagled the par-5 12th and had three birdies in a bogey-free round. The 33-year-old topped the crowded leaderboard at 12-under 201. In an interview with reporters afterward he quickly recalled that he birdied the 18th in the final round of the 2020 edition of the 3M Open without fans during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Woodland overcame a double bogey on No. 1 with birdies on five of his next six holes in a 67. McNealy had a bogey-free 68.

“There’s going to be birdies tomorrow. You’re still going to have to go low. You’re just going to have to play a good round in the wind” Woodland said.

Pat Perez shot a 66 to join an eight-way tie for fourth two shots off the lead. Four players were three strokes back. Louis Oosthuizen the highest-ranked player remaining at No. 9 in the world and in the FedEx Cup standings was in a six-way tie for 16th place at only four shots behind.

During yet another unseasonable day of 90-plus-degree heat the scores crept up throughout the afternoon with the thermometer as drier and breezier air affected the play.

Keith Mitchell had a record-tying seven straight birdies to start his round on his way to a 29 on the back nine. The front nine? He posted a 37 for a 66 that left him four strokes behind Tringale. Rickie Fowler birdied six of his first 10 holes before a triple bogey on the unrelenting 18th left him with a 70 and a tie for 29th in a six-stroke deficit.

The mini-lake in front of the 18th hole sure swallowed up a lot of balls. It’s currently ranked as the hardest par 5 on the PGA Tour. There were nine bogeys and 12 scores worse than that Saturday for a cumulative score of 35-over. The rest of the course was 85-under.

Tringale safely hit his first two shots along the edges of the fairway before landing his third attempt at the cusp of the green. His 52-foot shot put himself in perfect position for par.

“It’s picking the right spots to be aggressive” Tringale said.

Fowler on the other hand splashed his third shot well short of the green. After the penalty stroke he landed in the rough. After escaping that he left a 20-foot putt short. He took his highest score to finish a round in his tour career.

Mitchell matched Juan Sebastián Muñoz (2020) Brandt Snedeker (2007) and Joe Durant (2005) with seven birdies in a row to begin the round.

The 29-year-old Mitchell whose only career PGA Tour victory came in the Honda Classic in 2019 had his streak stopped when a putt lipped out on the 17th green. Then the hot air grew drier and breezier forcing a more conservative approach. The momentum shift he said was palpable. His tee shot on box No. 1 after the turn landed into the native grass area.

“I was like ‘If I keep swinging like this and executing like this we’re going to have a chance and then the wind picked up and I clearly didn’t’” said Mitchell who described his day as “two completely different rounds.”

The first half of his card was clearly a keeper.

“I actually felt some nerves a little bit but they were good nerves. It was a good kind of nervous not like the ‘Hope I don’t miss the cup’ nerves or ‘Where do we stand on the FedExCup’ nerves. It’s more of like ‘Hey I’m in contention again and I want to play well’ nerves and those are the good kind. Those are the fun kind.”

With only three tournaments remaining after this prior to the FedEx Cup playoffs Mitchell is one of several golfers near the 125-man cut who could use a strong performance on Sunday to create a bigger cushion. Mitchell entered the week ranked 114th. Perez was 115th. Chez Reavie who was two strokes behind Tringale was 119th. Fowler was 124th.

Senior British Open

Stephen Dodd equaled the lowest round in the history of the Senior British Open by shooting an 8-under 62 at Sunningdale England to take a two-stroke lead after three rounds.

The Welshman made nine birdies in a round that also tied Sunningdale’s Old Course record that was set by Nick Faldo at the 1986 European Open and then tied by Shane Lowry in British Open qualifying in 2010.

Jerry Kelly was two shots back after carding a 68 and day two leader Darren Clarke (70) slipped three strokes off the lead in the final senior major championship of the year.

Defending champion Bernhard Langer (70) was four shots off the pace with Miguel Angel Jimenez (67) and Paul Broadhurst (69). Jimenez was the winner in 2018 and Broadhurst won two years before that.

Dodd birdied four of his first five holes and only dropped one shot in a stellar performance that had him on 11-under 199 heading into the final round.

“I’ve played so little competitive golf over the last 18 months” he said. “I’ve played one event so I’m not really sure what will happen. With a little luck you never know.”

Dodd credited his record-tying round to the course – and some luck.

“The course is just set so well so fair. If you play well then there’s chances out there and luckily today for me I got some of them in” he said.

The 63-year-old Langer won in 2019 at Royal Lytham & St. Annes for his fourth victory in the event. The 2020 tournament was canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic.

Two-time British Open champion Ernie Els (70) was five shots back after three rounds.

Dodd joins Harold Henning and Jim Colbert in the Senior British Open history books. Both posted 8-under 62s at Turnberry – Henning in 1990 and Colbert in 2003.

A three-time European Tour winner Dodd made his Senior Tour debut at the Senior British Open in 2016 when he had his best finish at the event – a share of 14th place.

The Welshman who won his first professional title at the 1992 Austria Open is a three-time winner on the European Senior Tour. His last victory was on his 52nd birthday when he finished off a wire-to-wire victory at the Winston Senior Open in Germany.

Kelly who leads the Schwab Cup has yet to post a top 10 in this three Senior British Open appearances.

Evian Championship

The day after making golfing history Jeongeun Lee6 extended her Evian Championship lead to five strokes after a 3-under-par 68 in the third round at Evian-les-Baines France.

She’s at 18 under overall and the nearest challenger is teenage American Yealimi Noh at 13 under after carding a 4-under 67.

The 2015 champion Lydia Ko of New Zealand posted a 68 and was one shot behind the 19-year-old Noh.

South Korean Minjee Lee’s 6-under 65 moved her into a three-way tie for fourth spot at 11 under with Japan’s Ayaka Furue and Thailand’s Pajaree Anannarukarn who drifted back with a 1-over 72.

On Friday Lee6 tied the golf majors record for the lowest round ever by a female or male with a 10-under 61 while her history-making 36-hole score of 127 was the lowest in a major beating the 128 by Brooks Koepka at the 2019 U.S. PGA Championship.

But on Saturday Lee6 had a mixed bag of three bogeys four birdies and an eagle.

She started just before midday by going too wide on an approach to the green and landing in the rough but still almost chipped in before holding for par.

A rare error on the third hole saw her tee shot land in the bunker and she ended up with her first bogey since the 13th hole in the first round.

Lee6 birdied again on 10 eagled 11 bogeyed 17 after swiping an approach way wide from the fairway and birdied 18.

Inbee Park a seven-time major winner who won the Evian in 2012 before it became a major was out of contention and tied at 16th at 7 under after a par 71.

New world No. 1 Nelly Korda was tied for 32nd and defending champion Jin Young Ko dropped way down to 74th after carding a miserable round of 76 including four bogeys and a double bogey.

She won at Evian in 2019 but the event was canceled last year amid the coronavirus pandemic.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpdHktam91cm5hbC5vcmcvYXJ0aWNsZS95ZWFyLXplcm_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Year Zero,"On the day in March that eight people were murdered in a massage parlor in Atlanta six of them Asian-American a Cherokee County Georgia police captain gave a media briefing after the alleged murderer was caught. He described the suspect’s motivation as follows: “He was pretty much fed up and at the end of his rope and yesterday was a really bad day for him and this is what he did.”

Indignation erupted. How people cried could the police captain attribute the murders to someone merely having a bad day? Having determined that the crime was motivated by anti-Asian hatred the Internet furies concluded that the captain had spoken callously because of his own anti-Asian bias.

Leave aside that anyone who had seen a police movie could recognize as tough-guy talk the captain’s seemingly casual description of an unspeakable act. And never mind that just a few weeks later President Biden described the slaughter of eight people in a FedEx facility not as a human tragedy but as a “national embarrassment” as if it had been a messily disputed election. Consider instead what the policeman’s critics cared about. Imagine that the captain had appeared before the media and had said that he believed that the suspect was motivated by anti-Asian hatred and that this hate was the true virus ravaging us all. Would he have been lauded? Yes. But what if he gave this briefing while the suspect remained at large giving him time to flee? In reality the entire Atlanta police department was on the scene almost immediately. The suspect was caught shortly after the shootings before he could harm anyone else. Even if the police captain had been insensitive why should this matter more than his and his officers’ actions?

Words are crumbling under the weight of moral one-upmanship. One cannot for example call both Hitler and Donald Trump “fascists” without the term losing its meaning. But for four years an imminent fascist revolution sponsored by the Trump movement was a liberal obsession. (Hard to make a fascist revolution though without having the military on your side and Trump spent four years insulting both the military and the state’s intelligence apparatus.) Nor does the term “systemic racism” mean anything if it describes both the structure of apartheid in South Africa and slavery in the antebellum American South and the circumstances we live in today. Apartheid South Africa was systemically racist. Georgia in 1860 was systemically racist. But the New York suburb where I live—Montclair New Jersey—has a black mayor who succeeded another black mayor; a black superintendent of schools; a black assistant superintendent of schools; several black school principals; a black deputy chief of police; a self-conscious enclave of wealthy black bankers and black lawyers; and accomplished black residents from a world-famous jazz bassist to a former head of Homeland Security. Montclair is more racially socially and economically diverse than any neighborhood in New York City. Yet cries of Montclair’s systemic racism have now swept the town as well as its public school curricula.

In Shakespeare’s Troilus and Cressida Troilus has a nightmare vision in which language dissolves into “words words mere words.” If that world were actually to materialize he later thinks then

right and wrong

Between whose endless jar justice resides

Should lose their names and so should justice too.

Then every thing includes itself in power. . . .

Today right and wrong have indeed lost their names their singular distinctness. Now the disposition of power decides the status of many conflicts or tensions. And in this new world where right and wrong are determined by whoever exerts the greater power—that is whoever makes the loudest threats to shame and cancel—the emphatic appearance of what is right wields the most power of all.

Today’s social-justice advocates are motivated by what Rousseau understood to be man’s desire for superiority over others. (HISTORIC IMAGES/ALAMY STOCK PHOTO)

The curious thing is that even with tens of thousands of Internet public prosecutors working night and day very few examples of genuinely racist language surface in this turbulent chaotic country of 330 million people. Excepting the tiny minority of people who belong to organized right-wing hate groups anyone even fractionally socialized has known for decades that the N-word to take the worst racist term is taboo along with most other pernicious slurs. And anyone with the slightest bit of emotional intelligence understands that people who do use the word when quoting other people or texts—as clueless or maybe arrogant as that may be in our current climate—do so because they themselves are not racists and have no fear of being perceived as such.

Emotional intelligence however is becoming a liability in the age of algorithm-driven outrage-obsessed social media. When Dean Baquet executive editor of the New York Times first learned that the paper’s crack science reporter Donald McNeil Jr. had used the N-word in the process of paraphrasing someone else’s use of the word Baquet concluded that McNeil’s “remarks were offensive and that he showed extremely poor judgment but it did not appear to me that his intentions were hateful or malicious.” This one felt was a reasonable response.

But Baquet’s rationality and humanity had an effect similar to the Atlanta police captain’s innocuous words. They infuriated the (predominantly white) ranks of mostly younger New York Times staffers who sent a group letter declaring that “our community is outraged and in pain.” Baquet then made an abrupt about-face—how do you respond to declarations of “pain”?—and this time along with his managing editor issued an e-mail declaring: “We do not tolerate racist language regardless of intent.”

Regardless of intent! Others then raised their voices in protest against Baquet’s sudden new perspective on language and truth and Baquet swiftly reversed himself again. “In our zeal to make a powerful statement about our workplace culture” he told his staff “we ham-handedly said something you rightly saw as an oversimplification of one of the most difficult issues of our lives. It was a deadline mistake and I regret it. . . . Of course intent matters when we are talking about language in journalism. The author and his purpose also matter the moment matters.”

It was painful to see the editor of one of the world’s most prestigious newspapers stumble so publicly; it was painful to ask whether he a gifted journalist had found himself over his head in uncharted territory and had compromised his paper through a series of breathtaking reversals made to cover himself and put the blame for his malleability elsewhere. “We” this and “we” that; it was a “deadline mistake.”

But the most embarrassing part of the incident was the spectacle of the newspaper’s first black editor being hounded by a mostly white wholly privileged mob into submission when all he had to do was stand up and say: “I’m black I grew up in a black working-class neighborhood in the deep South brains and guts got me into an Ivy League school I won a Pulitzer Prize and I have one of the most distinguished careers in journalism. I tell you what the N-word means in this context. You don’t tell me.” Perhaps Baquet being black “and gifted with second sight in this American world” in W. E. B. Du Bois’s memorable phrase understood that the predominantly white mob that had taken over his newsroom enjoyed reducing his career to his stance on the N-word and thus making him entirely dependent on the outcome of their privileged white outrage. Perhaps Baquet went along with this because he thought that he still had the ultimate power. That would be an old American story about race about black resourcefulness when confronted by white liberal condescension. As Martin Luther King said the white leaders of the North “welcomed me to their cities and showered praise on the heroism of Southern Negroes. Yet . . . only the language was polite; the rejection was firm and unequivocal.”

Bullied by a young and woke newsroom New York Times executive editor Dean Baquet pressured a veteran journalist to resign. (NATAN DVIR/POLARIS/NEWSCOM)

We are now living in a new golden age of American racism. So long as you talk the proverbial talk—and if you really need extra cover make the obligatory accusations and issue the compulsory condemnations—you can actually indulge racist impulses. You can inveigh against racism at your local school board meeting and then a year or two later quietly move your children into the whitest private school you can find. You can fawn so fulsomely over your white daughter’s black friend that the friend will never return to your house. You can be so excessively polite yet calculatedly distant with black people that you will ensure that none will enter your life. If you are a Coca-Cola executive you can declaim against the new Georgia voting laws even as you market your product extra-aggressively in poor black neighborhoods where the obesity and diabetes caused in part by regular soda consumption has by now afflicted generations of black children. Maybe the hope among Coca-Cola executives is that thanks to the new rhetoric of morally superior denunciation you can start addicting liberal white kids in the suburbs too: “Woke Goes Better with Coke.” And why not? Apple tells me that in order to “protect the environment” it will no longer include a power adapter and earphones at no extra charge with its new phones. However Apple will gladly sell them to me.

German economist Werner Sombart famously predicted that socialism would founder in America on the “reef of roast beef and apple pie” meaning that American prosperity would not provide a breeding ground for the kind of popular discontent with material conditions that socialism needs to thrive. What we are witnessing now is the first social revolution to draw all its energy from prosperity as today’s “radicals” failing to find the suitable material conditions for their revolution focus on words divorced from context unprovable “micro-aggressions” and particular abuses of power that supposedly represent universal conditions.

Occurring in the most prosperous nation ever known the woke insurrection has a self-indulgent inwardness that makes it susceptible to the most incongruous influences. This onslaught could be the first time in American history that commercial interests have helped drive a radical social revolution. It was the Left that used to rail against marketing strategies that sanctimoniously concealed the profit motive behind them. Now conservatives do that—just as generations of left-wing writers once accused big media of in effect producing “fake news” a charge now made by the other side.

Maybe this reversal is not so surprising when you consider that also for the first time in American history the media are an engine behind social change rather than being the relatively detached institution that reports on it. The New York Times’s 1619 Project which attempted to prove that racism is fundamental to the American system is a paradigmatic example: it was speculative amateurish inaccurate and sloppily written activism presented absurdly as an objective journalistic investigation into the past.

The media-driven pattern of indignation accusation and condemnation is becoming tediously familiar. A group waits its turn in the queue for some singular event that the media insist is representative of its horrible circumstances in America. Then it leaps onto the social ladder and climbs a few rungs before reluctantly returning to the back of the line and waiting again while others grab their turn.

Commercial calculation doubtless plays a role in this process. Recently the New York Times sent one of its reporters to ferret out an instance of anti-Semitism that might warm the hearts of its Jewish readers who could well feel neglected these days. The Times reporter came up with the seemingly anti-Semitic persecution of a Jewish student at the Marine Academy of Science and Technology located in rural New Jersey. But the story had some holes. The Jewish student had waited years to complain. She had many friends at the school. She had been voted school treasurer. She didn’t even seem to want to leave.

The reporter noted: “In New Jersey alone bias incidents reported to law enforcement increased by 55 percent between 2016 and 2018 following a decade of decline.” Statistics bear out both assertions. Indeed between 2010 and 2018 reports of bias incidents in New Jersey fell by about 40 percent. But the article left out two other statistics. In a state of nearly 9 million people 569 bias incidents were recorded in 2018. Keep in mind that these were police reports of bias; they had yet to be determined as such in a court of law.

When demand exceeds supply discord follows and indeed no integrated consortium of the oppressed exists. Black Lives Matter was quiet after Atlanta just as Asian-American civil rights leaders were mostly quiet after the murder of George Floyd. And few activist groups officially denounced the slaughter at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh. The satirist in me imagines each group muttering impatiently as it momentarily endures the attention trained on another. The mockery of “Karens”—entitled white women—seemed like an effort by frustrated black people who had watched the #MeToo movement eclipse Black Lives Matter to discredit their rivals for attention.

Empty forms bespeak empty hearts. Cries of racism are the new white racism. Now to use a hypothetical example if a modestly middle-class white male resident of Montclair meets a wealthy black neighbor who makes more in six months than the white male has made in his whole working life or if he runs into the jazz great who lives in town and who has won no fewer than seven Grammys then the average white guy doesn’t have to feel that twinge of lower economic or social status in comparison with theirs. On the contrary: thanks to the 1619 Project and the totalizing framework of systemic white racism he can regard these elevated figures with condescending pity. It turns out that they are and always will be dependent on his status as master of their fates.

Looking back it is astonishing that anyone would have thought Donald Trump posed a “fascist” threat. “Fascism is not our future—it cannot be; we cannot allow it to be so—but this is surely the way fascism can begin” declared New Yorker editor David Remnick not 24 hours after Trump was elected—and not too long before he invited (and then disinvited) Steve Bannon to speak at the New Yorker Festival. To the extent that Trump could be called some sort of aspiring fascist he resembled what Ernie Pyle once said about Italy in the 1930s: the country was like a dog that got hit by a truck while trying to bite its tires.

Just as Trump’s insults about people’s intelligence and sanity reflected an insecurity about his own the liberal obsession with the coming fascist revolution has self-revealing origins. Actual fascism has three cardinal traits: a totalizing mentality that reduces the world to a single cause; a worldview that regards every human interaction as social and that allows no space for unquantifiable private life; and an insistence that all human affairs involve politics and questions of power. Sound familiar?

One day a group of Polish Communists visited Stalin in Moscow. After greeting his guests Stalin asked “Where is Comrade Z? Why is Comrade Z not here? She is one of the brightest and most promising voices in the party. Why has she not joined you?” The Polish Communists looked at the ground in terror. They knew that Stalin had had Comrade Z killed shortly before they left Poland. Our own open secret too swiftly punished to reveal publicly is that the woke revolution is a sham disconnected from history society experience intuition and common sense.

Rousseau one of the fathers of modern democracy distinguished between two types of primal egotism: amour de soi and amour propre. Both mean “self-love” but they are radically different. Amour de soi is the biological drive for self-preservation. Amour propre originates in the competition for a sexual mate and it seeks the esteem of others.

One Rousseau scholar describes amour propre as “the insatiable desire for superiority over one’s fellow beings based on the degree of moral respect one claims for oneself relative to others.” Another goes further. He writes that amour propre represents “a demand on others that they think better of us than they think of themselves.” That seems in the current moment just about right.

Rousseau did imagine a bright side to amour propre in which the quality would regulate itself democratically with people taming their basest hypocrisies in order not to devalue themselves by appearing sanctimonious. But the ability to tame the deepest impulses to vaunt one’s moral superiority over other people to the point that they think better of you than they think of themselves depends on a precious quality: self-esteem. If you respect yourself you do not need to inflate your virtue to win others’ respect.

We inhabit however the most culturally and socially fluid environment in the history of mankind. The Internet makes any fantasy seem real while social media isolate us and make us continuously uncertain of our moral standing among our peers and colleagues. This leads to moral accusation and denunciation—the quickest shortcuts to superior standing and moral invulnerability.

Trump was right when he described at one time or another various media organizations as “failing” in this atmosphere. The media are a collapsing environment that fosters tremendous insecurity in the people who work there an insecurity that editors and their writers project out onto the American scene.

You could see the writing on the wall way back in 2003 when the ad hominem gossip website Gawker was founded. Liberal media wounded by their role in the Iraq War were feeling especially vulnerable to criticism. A website that mocked its victims in the most personal terms reduced its targets to abject terror.

It was astounding to see the New York Times for example contort itself to placate Gawker in myriad ways. But this was a portent. Pummeled by one social media giant after another big media were laying people off in large numbers over the next 13 years. Trump’s election might have stanched the bleeding for a while but his attacks unnerved media entities as they cast an envious eye on his Twitter feed and unconsciously remade themselves in his sensationalizing truth-bending image.

By the time the so-called Shitty Media Men list appeared—containing names of men who had allegedly harassed or assaulted women in the workplaces of various media organizations—new power centers were arising as more and more individuals felt powerless and the infinite regression of newsroom demographics proceeded rapidly. Male and female old and young divided like cells into black and white brown and white yellow and white cis and trans and on and on.

The tribes proliferated all the while justifying their existence by blaming the new social divisions on Trump the crude developer from Queens who was somehow portrayed as a dazzling Lucifer. Editors and reporters producers and commentators felt increasingly marginalized depending on who the martyred social group of the day was. On one side the Scylla of sudden cancellation—is “cancel” some subliminal projection of a subscription being “canceled” the media’s abiding fear?—and on the other the Charybdis of social and professional irrelevance. And all the while amour propre as a survival technique became more deliberate and intense. It had and has the power of a vaccine. I am better than you. You can’t touch me.

On top of everything else those damn boomers thanks to the miracles of medical technology weren’t going anywhere. You can’t overestimate the “toxicity”—amour propre has universalized its nature in a term—of the generational combat in news organizations now. “Racist” more and more applied to situations that have nothing to do with race—infrastructure for example—has now become another word for “old.” As competition in dying media organizations reaches unbearable levels forms of one-upmanship become ever more morally rarefied.

The pandemic provided the final touch to the woke revolution in the media. Isolated at home confined to endless Zoom meetings journalists especially Zoomers and millennials lost all sense of what their standing was among their peers. The last supports of self-esteem fell away. Amour propre—the irrefutable implacable unanswerable assertion of superior moral status—became an instrument of professional survival and a technique of mental and emotional balance.

This is the most sinister dimension of the new woke social order. It is not fundamentally rooted in ideology or even in a hunger for power. Its origins lie deep in the always threatened ever insatiable human ego.

Accused Capitol rioter Andrew Taake however apparently tried to score a hot date first.

A criminal complaint filed Friday against Taake alleges that the Houston native attacked police officers on Jan. 6 with a metal whip and pepper spray—then bragged about it on the dating app Bumble. He now faces six charges related to the attack. The allegations were first reported by HuffPost.

The FBI said they received a tip on Jan. 9 from a Bumble user who shared screenshots of their exchange. In it Taake said he was “pepper sprayed tear gassed and hit with batons for peacefully standing there.”

That’s despite social media posts and body-cam footage showing him using a metal whip to attack officers before pepper-spraying them authorities say. The criminal complaint alleges Taake eventually made his way inside the Capitol with surveillance footage showing the whip held to his side.

The FBI says Taake’s current location on the Bumble app at the time he was in D.C. was listed as Alexandria Virginia while his profile noted he lived in Houston. Flight logs indicated he flew into Baltimore/Washington Airport from Houston on Jan. 5 and listed his cellphone number in flight documents.

After consulting with a FedEx driver delivering a package to his Houston home in May and physically surveilling Taake the feds believed they found a match.

Taake faces charges of obstructing an official proceeding obstructing police engaging in disorderly conduct on restricted property causing disorder at the Capitol and two counts of assaulting officers.

He is not the first Capitol rioter to be found through Bumble. New Yorker Robert Chapman was arrested in April after also bragging about his participation on the app eventually changing his Facebook profile picture to a photo from inside the Capitol."

Stadium Info FANFARE Score: 3.57

Fifth Third Bank Stadium 3200 George Busby Pkwy Kennesaw GA 30144

Year Opened: 2010 Capacity: 8300





The Proving Ground

The state of Georgia’s third largest university also plays host to Atlanta’s top USL affiliate due to its proximity to the parent team’s training facility being located just five miles away in Marietta GA. ATL UTD 2 has played its home matches at Fifth Third Bank Stadium at Kennesaw State University since 2019. The stadium is in the KSU Sports and Entertainment Park which is located off campus from the main academic campus by approximately 2 miles. The Sports and Entertainment Park is managed by an outside entity which allows it to seek outside groups musical and athletic organizations and nonprofits to use the venue when it is not scheduled for use by the KSU football lacrosse men’s and women’s soccer programs. Funds generated by these outside groups help defray some of the costs involved in operating the athletic department at KSU.





Fifth Third Bank Stadium opened in 2010 and its first use was as the home stadium for KSU’s lacrosse and men’s and women’s soccer programs (Kennesaw State did not have a football program until 2015). Another early tenant of the stadium was the Atlanta Beat a member of the Women’s Professional Soccer League which played in the stadium from 2010-2012.





The stadium is very modernistic in design with all seating bowl completely located below the entry/concourse level of the facility. The stadium has 8300 seats along with a yellow black and white color scheme (KSU’s team colors). No seating is more than more than 20 rows from the pitch providing an excellent view of the action.





Food & Beverage 4

There are three concession stands servicing the seating areas. Two serve the western stands while the third services the crowd sitting in the stands at the south end of the pitch. They can get congested at halftime so you may want to do a quick pick up shortly before the half ends. There are some specialized food carts along the course with limited food choices but quick service.





Menus at the stands include brats ($6) pork sandwiches ($8) hot dogs ($4) burgers ($8) pretzels ($4) pizza slices ($6) and tater tots ($4). Snack items include popcorn ($4) peanuts ($5) and candy ($4). You may also want to check out the Atlanta-based King of Pops cart which has a wide variety of unique flavored popsicles for $4.

Beverages include Coca-Cola brand sodas ($4) bottled water ($3) and sweet tea ($3). Because the stadium is not on college property it is allowed to sell alcoholic beverages. Domestic beers are $7 and craft beers are available for $8.





Atmosphere 4

Fifth Third Stadium features a very contemporary design that projects a very low profile at street level. From the outside all you see is a one-story structure featuring the KSU colors of white black and yellow. The ticket windows are to the left of the structure with the central portion featuring the main breezeway.





It is only once inside that you can see the benefit to this design. The stadium concourse is at street level with concession stands the team store and restrooms located at this level. All seats on the west side of the stadium are below the concourse and are near the pitch. This provides an excellent view of the action as no seat is more than 20 rows from all the action. There is simply no bad seat in the house.





The stadium features individual seats throughout the venue which is unusual in an era when venues typically have aluminum benches. The stadium seats are wider than found in most stadiums creating greater fan comfort throughout the game.





A 1350 square foot Daktronics video board is in the north end zone providing replays of key plays and constant updates on the statistical side of the game.





Neighborhood 3

The immediate area surrounding the stadium is made up of the KSU Sports and Entertainment Park. This park is designed to serve both the intercollegiate and the intermural of Kennesaw State’s athletic and student recreation needs while also serving as a community park for the neighboring area. The Sports and Entertainment Park includes seven athletic fields a track and field complex a mile long walking trail and a nine-acre lake.





Beyond the Sports and Entertainment Park are a wide variety of restaurants lodging facilities and shops along Chastain Road. The 1.5 million square foot Town Center Mall is located just a mile south of the stadium and can be accessed via a walking trail network that crisscrosses the area. There are more than 175 stores at Town Center Mall. Restaurants in the area include Tin Lizzy’s Marlow’s Tavern and just about every fast food franchise you can think of. Lodging along Chastain Road includes the Comfort Inn at KSU and the Hampton Inn-Kennesaw.





History buffs may want to visit a pair of Civil War related sites just west of the KSU main campus on the west side of I-75. The town of Kennesaw has an excellent Civil War exhibit next to the railroad crossing on Big Shanty Road. The Kennesaw Mountain National Battlefield Park is hard to miss as the mountain looms over the KSU campus. The battlefield was a very strategic part of the Battle of Atlanta as the mountain’s height provided a clear view of Atlanta for the invading Union army. There are also more than 30 miles of hiking biking and walking trails within this immense park.





Fans 3

Fifth Third Stadium is the first multipurpose stadium built in a suburban location in the Atlanta area. This has been proven to be a very successful move for both ATL UTD 2 as well as the many other events held at the venue. Cobb County is a hotbed for youth soccer and all the county schools have soccer programs. The youth market is a major part of the team’s fan base and each game the stadium recognizes teams in attendance on the video board.





A second group in the team’s fan base are members of the main Atlanta United’s supporter groups who live in the suburbs. They bring their MLS level of energy chants and tifo’s to the USL level. Supporter groups have their own designated seating area in the end zone area allowing them to stand the whole game without blocking the view of other fans at the game.





The third component of the fan base are simply sports fans who live in the suburbs and do not want to fight the Atlanta traffic in order to see a major league sports event. They are still learning the game and enjoy the free parking and low ticket prices for ATL UTD 2.





Access 4

Fifth Third Bank Stadium is located about 8 miles north of the I-285 perimeter highway that encircles the Atlanta area. It is located directly off I-75 at the Chastain Road exit (#271). Coming from the north: Take I-75 South to the Chastain Road exit. Turn left onto Chastain Road. Proceed to the red light at George Busbee Parkway and turn right. The Black and Gold parking areas will be on your right as you approach the stadium which is at the end of Busbee Parkway. From the south: Take I-75 North to Chastain Road exit. Turn right on Chastain Road and follow the directions above to the parking lots and the stadium.





Once you reach the stadium there are four entry gates to choose from. Gates open one hour prior to the game. All tickets are digital so have your phones ready. ATL UTD 2 uses only the stands at the end of the pitch and the western stands of the stadium. This is sufficient to seat the crowds that attend the soccer games. It also keeps fans from the east stands which would be looking directly into the sun for late afternoon and early evening games.





Return on Investment 5

A night out at an ATL UTD 2 game provides an excellent return on your investment. Tickets are priced at $20 no matter where the seat is located in the stadium. Parking is free in the Black or Gold parking lots located just across the street. The concession prices are very reasonable. Most fans are from the local area but fans from the visiting team can find lodging along nearby Chastain Road in the $90-$130 range per night.





Extras 2

Among the other events the Fifth Third Bank Stadium has hosted are the Shaky Boots Country Music Festival the Owl-O-Ween Balloon Festival (Kennesaw State teams are known as the Owls) the MLL National Championship Game Atlanta Blaze lacrosse games the Georgia State High School Soccer Championships.





The stadium is designed to be easily expandable as the popularity of the various events grows. The visitor’s side (east stands) can be double decked and the end zones have room for expansion as well. This would still preserve the intimate nature of the venue.





Final Thoughts

Fifth Third Band and the Sports and Entertainment Park were a gamble when they were built by Kennesaw State University in 2010. It has been an investment that has paid great dividends as the stadium and the adjoining sports park are in use by both professional teams and teams coming from the local community. It has successfully sponsored music festivals and other events that go far beyond the KSU educational community. The development at KSU was closely monitored by the Atlanta Braves who eventually also relocated to the suburbs and built Truist Park and its Battery live/work/play area. Although these were considered unusual moves at the time nobody is questioning those decisions now.

Matayo H. Young and Myron McKinney both 20 appeared Thursday before U.S. District Court Magistrate Judge John E. Martin to admit they acted together last year in committing two holdups.

Young and McKinney had been scheduled to stand trial next month on charges that if convicted would have carried a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison.

The two gave up their right to make the government prove them guilty in return for a promise of a more lenient sentence according to plea agreements they made earlier this month with the U.S. attorney’s office.

Martin states in court records that he heard the two men acknowledge they knowingly gave up their constitutional trial rights. Martin also heard the strength of the evidence prosecutors would have presented against them if a trial had taken place.

According to the FBI the first robbery took place Aug. 3 2020.

Young walked into the TCF Bank branch 17830 Halsted St. Homewood wearing a black mask and clothing and glasses. McKinney stayed outside in a car acting as a lookout.

Young handed a bank teller a note stating “This a robbery. Put all the money in an envelope. Do not make any sudden movements or pull alarm or say anything or people will get hurt – $5000.”

A teller gave him $1010 and he fled on foot. Police who rushed to the bank didn’t catch Young. A surveillance camera showed Young jumping into a black Hyundai which sped away records state.

McKinney attempted to rob a BMO Harris Bank branch in Hammond Aug. 6 2020 but couldn’t. Its doors were locked court records state.

The second successful robbery took place 3:30 p.m. Aug. 8 2020 when Young entered the Peoples Bank branch 130 Rimback St. Hammond records state.

He handed a teller a note that read “This is a robbery. $10000 in an envelope or I will shoot."" A teller gave him $800 in an envelope. He fled to the getaway vehicle with McKinney according to court records.

Police arrested the pair an hour later that same day while responding to a call of suspicious activity outside a Fifth Third Bank 21403 Cicero Ave. Matteson Illinois.

Officers found Young and McKinney outside the Fifth Third Bank branch in a black Hyundai Sonata with the same license plate as the suspect car in the Aug. 3 2020 Homewood TCF Bank robbery records state.

Officers searched the car and found $800 taken from the Peoples Bank branch in Hammond as well as clothing Young was seen wearing during the robberies.

Officers said they also confiscated the two defendants’ cellphones and found video and text messages linking the defendants more closely to the robberies.

The FBI found location searches they made on at least one of the phones of all three banks as well driving directions to them.

Defense attorneys initially argued there wasn’t enough evidence to detain the two defendants over the robberies and also challenged the legality of the FBI downloading the data from the men’s cellphones.

But the court overruled all those objections on grounds the evidence was strong enough to detain them and that the men voluntarily gave police permission to search their phones.

Martin is recommending their guilty pleas be accepted.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMizwFodHRwczovL3JpYWJpei5jb20vYS8yMDIxLzcvMjQvZW1wb3dlci1jbGltYnMtdG8tMTQtdHJpbGxpb24tb24tZmlmdGgtYWNxdWlzaXRpb24tcHJ1ZGVudGlhbHMtcmVjb3JkLWtlZXBpbmctYnVzaW5lc3MtYnV0LWZpZGVsaXR5LWhpdC10aGUtMTQtdHJpbGxpb24tbWFyay1pbi0yMDE0LWFuZC1pcy1wdWxsaW5nLWF3YXktb24tb3JnYW5pYy1ncm93dGgtYWxvbmXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Empower climbs to $1.4 trillion on fifth acquisition--Prudential's record-keeping business-- but Fidelity hit the $1.4 ...,OCIO sale to Mercer may be Buckley's last act • Goldman's retail lead departs • PIMCO latest to convert mutual funds • Software firm upgrades Schwab data • Krawcheck preaches wisdom of naps • Fidelity hit by data snafu but D&I on track • New Lonsdale tech shop imminent • Vestorly founder now funding start-ups • Eight month wait for CMO ends at LPL.,,,,,,

The town of Kingaroy which is situated 210km (nearly a 2.5 hour drive) from Brisbane is famously known for one particular thing. To many Australian's it’s called the ‘Peanut Capital of Australia’ but for Clancy it is also home.

So how did a girl from regional Queensland with no beach in sight come to be a beach volleyball player?

After being talent identified in high school Clancy moved to Brisbane at the age of 15 for training at the Queensland Academy of Sport (QAS) on a scholarship before eventually moving to Adelaide South Australia just two years later to join Australia’s volleyball program.

As Clancy explained moving from indoor to beach volleyball is the “normal pathway” in Australia but it also gave her the option to have a shot at going to an Olympic Games – something she had been dreaming about from a young age.

Clancy had always had the goal of becoming a professional athlete - a dream that began while watching sports on television - but it was the Olympic Games Sydney 2000 that had the biggest impact on the then eight-year-old.

“I think as soon as you watch footy [rugby league] and stuff on TV you're like ‘Oh you can do this for a job’” Clancy laughed. “That's amazing and then the 2000 Olympics rolled around and I was like ‘I want to go to the Olympics’.”

It wasn’t so much beach volleyball that caught her attention but one of the biggest and most memorable moments from the Games one that is still talked about to this day – Cathy Freeman’s 400m final.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZhaXJwbGFuZXQub3JnL3N0b3J5L3NoaW5pbmctdGhlLXNwb3RsaWdodC1vbi1zb2xhci1wb3dlcmVkLWNvbW11bml0aWVzLWluLWFmcmljYS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Shining the spotlight on solar-powered communities in Africa,"As Africa looks to tackle its yawning energy gap with an estimated 600 million people having no access to electricity it is turning to alternative low cost and sustainable sources of energy among them solar to bridge this deficit and address the energy crisis. Numerous interventions have been rolled out targeting the bottom of the pyramid - mostly in the rural areas that are not connected to national grids.

Over the years Africa has grappled with exorbitant prices of conventional power.

In East Africa for example the average energy price is estimated at 14.8 US cents per kilowatt per hour compared to Canada’s 8.11 US cents per kilowatt per hour. This is despite Canada’s GDP being more than triple that of the East African Community bloc.

Beyond the numbers clean energy sources have been credited with addressing health concerns associated with fossil fuels including respiratory diseases easing pressure on forests protecting the environment and mitigating the adverse effects of climate change.

An energy renaissance in Africa

The driving force for the renewable energy renaissance in Africa is the burgeoning population climate change unprecedented urbanisation trade and industrialisation among other competing needs.

With Africa boasting of extensive renewable energy resources the continent is at a prime position to tap into these resources and drive a global sustainable energy future.

Africa remains the most sun-rich continent in the world enjoying on average 10 hours of solar each day and it is this vital resource that it wants to harness in order to meet its energy needs.

The International Energy Agency IEA posits that solar photovoltaic energy will contribute 47 percent of all Sub Saharan Africa’s mini grids and off-the-grid power generation systems by 2040.

African governments private sector entities multilateral banks and development agencies have championed the adoption of renewable energy particularly in underserved regions of Africa with a view to enhancing achievement of universal energy access.

From Morocco to Kenya solar villages proliferate

Through innovative models including Pay as you go where beneficiaries pay affordable installments to access power millions of rural dwellers across Africa now have access to clean energy which they are using to preserve food in their refrigerators charge mobile phones and light up schools and households. Furthermore health centres can now store drugs and vaccines for long and there has been a marked mushrooming of businesses.

“Since [the] introduction of solar energy in this region three years ago I have opened small businesses including phone accessories and repair shops a salon a small food kiosk and maize milling shop. These businesses have employed about ten people and provided me with income to take care of my family. With access to energy our region has been awakened and there is a lot of trade going on. A revolution of sorts is now evident in our once sleepy town” said Caleb Mutiso an entrepreneur in Eastern Kenya who quit his job to run his businesses after solar mini grids were introduced in his area that had gone for decades without electricity.

Such ‘solar-powered’ towns and villages have sprouted across Kenya as renewable energy companies including BBOXX Azuri Technologies M-KOPA Greenlight Planet all dealing with solar scramble to sate the growing appetite for clean and sustainable energy.

Morocco a harbinger of renewable energy has built the Noor-Ouarzazate complex the world's largest solar farm and now prides itself in owning what has been billed as Africa’s first fully solar-powered village.

Championed by the solar company Cleanergy the model has been designed to meet the full energy needs of a community by embracing solar. Previously residents of Id Mjahdi village located in north western Morocco relied on tree bark for cooking and heating and on candles for lighting with candlelight lasting for just about an hour in the evenings.

With the installation of solar photovoltaic panels that generate electricity that is then distributed through a mini grid households now utilise solar power for their daily energy use including heating lighting and preserving food; schools and health centres are able to comfortably meet their needs and there has been an explosion of businesses in the area.

The model has been hailed for its potential to be replicated across Africa and the developing world.

COVID-19 and prohibitive costs slow down solar ambitions

But as Africa savours the clean energy revolution financing still remains a barrier to reaching millions more who are still underserved. The initial cost of installation of solar photovoltaic panels remains prohibitive which has threatened scaling ambitions.

The outbreak of COVID-19 has further put a damper on the enterprise. Studies now show that the number of those without access to electricity in Sub Saharan African is likely to grow as a result of the pandemic as governments dedicate their efforts to tackling the virus.

The global rise in poverty levels now means that those who could previously afford electricity are now unable to forcing them to go back to dangerous sources like fossil fuels; 30 million of these people are located in Africa according to an IEA report.

“The onus is therefore on African governments to explore innovative and hybrid funding models that tap into public private and donor finances to ensure that the momentum gained in access to renewable energy is maintained if the continent is to meet the growing demand for electricity from a growing population” notes Thomas Mujimbi a renewable energy auditor.

Tiny Light Sails Could be Used to Explore the Solar System Today,"Solar sails have been receiving a lot of attention lately. In part that is due to a series of high profile missions that have successfully proven the concept. It’s also in part due to the high profile Breakthrough Starshot project which is designing a solar sail powered mission to reach Alpha Centauri. But this versatile third propulsion system isn’t only useful for far flung adventures – it has advantages closer to home as well. A new paper by engineers at UCLA defines what those advantages are and how we might be able to best utilize them.

The literal driving force behind some solar sail projects are lasers. These concentrated beams of light are perfect to provide a pushing force against a solar sail. However they are also useful as weapons if scaled up too much vaporizing anything in its path. As such one of the main design constraints for solar sail systems is around materials that can withstand a high power laser blast yet still be light enough to not burden the craft it is attached to with extra weight.

UT video discussing what a solar sail is.

For the missions that graduate student Ho-Ting Tung and Dr. Artur Davoyan of UCLA’s Mechanical Engineering Department envision that weight is miniscule. They expect any sailing spacecraft to weigh less than 100 grams. That 100 grams would include a sail array that measures up to 10 cm square.

With such small masses and large area comes the huge benefit of solar sailing – the maximum speed achievable by this propulsion technology is leaps and bounds faster than the two more traditional technologies – chemical and electrical propulsion. The study focused on two types of orbital maneuvers normally performed by those other propulsion systems – one where the sail moved around in Earth’s orbit and one where it traveled between planets.

The first system looks at how long it would take to move across the various stages of escape from Earth. As measured by “?v” (i.e. acceleration) the steady increase in acceleration provided by a laser on a solar sail would allow a small spacecraft to get from low Earth orbit to geostationary orbit in under a few minutes and then up to escape velocity shortly thereafter.

It also has the advantage of being able to accelerate faster than the fastest acceleration ever by a spacecraft – a record currently held by Dawn during its attempt to get to the outer solar system. This new solar sail would reach accelerations in about a half hour of laser time what it took Dawn 5 and a half years to reach using its electric thruster.

UT video discussing some of the possibilities of solar sailing.

Such linear acceleration would dramatically cut down on interplanetary travel times as well – such a solar sail could reach Mars in 20 days (compared to 200 normally) Jupiter in 120 days (5 years for Juno) and Pluto in about 3 years (10 years last time we visited with New Horizons). Drops in travels times means more opportunities for science but only if the instruments on board can fit into the relatively small lightweight package the sail can support.

The instruments themselves aren’t the only important part of that package though. Arguably the most important is the design of the sail itself. Its main design constraints take up much of the analysis of the paper. It must be light strong/flexible reflective to the laser (so that the laser pushes it rather than being absorbed) and be able to withstand high temperatures.

Figure from the paper showing differences in acceleration times and potential trajectories a solar sail could take.

The last two constraints are paired together and were really the focus of the paper as high reflectivity means less need to withstand high temperatures. After selecting a laser that works well in the atmosphere the team came up with two types of material that could do the trick for a sail – silicon nitride and boron nitride. In both those materials the extremely high reflectivity combined with a thermal emissivity (how well it dissipates heat) make them ideal candidates to fill the last two constraints.

To get the most out of the material performance however they must be formed in a way to take advantage of their material properties. There were two types of structures analyzed in the paper – a “Bragg stack” and a guided mode resonance (GMR) reflector. A Bragg stack is a type of reflector with multiple stacks of material forming a wavelength-specific high quality reflector. A GMR reflector on the other hand uses a type of grating or prism to control what wavelengths the structure becomes reflective in. In both cases the structure is designed so that light not at the specific wavelength of the laser isn’t reflected causing minimal excess heating to the panel array.

Ultimately the paper itself is only an attempt to suggest a design for a future mission concept. There isn’t anything concrete planned to adopt any of its suggestions. But it is a step towards looking at this potentially game changing propulsion technology which is only now starting to get off the ground. If we leverage it correctly solar sailing could have a fundamental impact on both the science and economics of space exploration.

-- After one year of operation China's first ultra high-voltage (UHV) power superhighway for transmitting clean energy delivered 13.1 billion kWh of power from the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau to densely populated Henan in central China.

-- As the world's first all-clean energy UHV power transmission project it is a pilot project aiding China's pursuit of attaining carbon dioxide emissions peak before 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality before 2060.

-- The line is expected to start running at full capacity by 2023 offering 41.2 billion kWh of green power annually. The output is equivalent to one-third of the power generation of the Three Gorges Dam and accounts for about one-eighth of the current annual electricity consumption in Henan.





by Xinhua writers Ma Yujie Li Jinfeng and Luo Xiaofei

XINING July 24 (Xinhua) -- After one year of operation China's first ultra high-voltage (UHV) power superhighway for transmitting clean energy delivered 13.1 billion kWh of power from the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau abundant in energy resources to densely populated Henan in central China according to State Grid's Qinghai branch.

As the world's first all-clean energy UHV power transmission project the 800-kilovolt direct current transmission line became operational on July 15 2020. It extends 1563 km across four provinces.

It is a pilot project aiding China's pursuit of attaining carbon dioxide emissions peak before 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality before 2060.

POWER OUTPUT GALORE

Construction of the project began in November 2018 and was completed in May 2020.

""It took only two years for the project to be completed which refreshed the construction speed of similar projects"" said Zeng Shengwei who leads a construction crew of the project.

Compared with other power transmission systems the UHV transmission has a larger capacity bigger range lower losses and uses fewer land resources.

Northwest China's Qinghai Province boasts rich clean energy resources. It has a vast expanse of land that can be used for setting up photovoltaic power generation facilities and wind farms with the amount of exploitable solar energy exceeding 3.5 billion kW accounting for 11 percent of the national total.

The line linking Qinghai and Henan is expected to start running at full capacity by 2023 offering 41.2 billion kWh of green power annually. The output is equivalent to one-third of the power generation of the Three Gorges Dam and accounts for about one-eighth of the current annual electricity consumption in Henan -- which has dense industrial clusters and is in huge demand for energy.

Henan Huarong Food Co. Ltd. which produces jam dehydrated vegetables and beverages is a big user of electricity in Shangcai County located in the city of Zhumadian Henan.

Yue Chunchang head of the company said that in the past due to power shortage the company would receive a notice of power outage for at least one or two days when power consumption peaks in winter and summer. ""We would lose nearly 300000 yuan (about 46380 U.S. dollars) if our production lines stop running for a day"" Yue said.

But since the UHV line started operating Yue said the company never had to suspend production. ""Now we purely use clean energy from the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau which can also reduce coal consumption.""

TECHNOLOGICAL BREAKTHROUGHS

Stretching from the Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Qinghai all the way to the city of Zhumadian in Henan the Qinghai-Henan UHV project overturned many technological bottlenecks that had plagued long-distance transmission of clean energy.

Fang Baomin director of the power distribution center under State Grid's Qinghai branch said that solar and wind power usually only accounts for about 30 percent of the total energy transmitted by the power grid but the Qinghai-Henan UHV line mainly transports clean energy posing an unprecedented challenge to the safe operation of the power grid.

""Once the transmission is interrupted the photovoltaic generators will automatically go offline causing power failure in a large area"" said Lu Guoqiang with the State Grid's Qinghai branch.

After a long period of brainstorming by top experts in China's power sector a tailored solution was found and the power line and the system were ready in less than eight months.

""The Qinghai-Henan UHV line made a breakthrough in long-distance clean power transmission and one second of transmission is enough for an ordinary family to use for two years"" said Li Binshan head of the Qingnan converter station at the origin of the line.

The UHV line also adopts advanced technologies to store energy for better use of power. An energy storage power station in the Gobi Desert was plugged into Qinghai's power grid in 2019. It can store power at the peak generating period and discharge power when the power load soars.

More such stations are in the pipeline which are expected to further stabilize power transmission through the line.

GREEN ENERGY GREEN DEVELOPMENT

The stable operation of the Qinghai-Henan UHV line also helps generate wealth for the locals.

Every morning herder Xiang Zhankui takes more than 2000 sheep to the green industrial development park in the Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture for grazing.

""In the past the barren land did not have grass at all. Now vegetation thrives under the photovoltaic panels and the sheep are well fed and strong"" said Xiang who was hired two years ago as a shepherd in the park on a monthly salary of 3000 yuan.

""We have higher income now and the environment is also improving"" he said.

The green industrial development park in the Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture created nearly 3000 jobs for local residents and Qinghai now has the highest proportion of new energy installed capacity in China.

""The construction of the park has provided stable new energy and harvested unexpected fruits of ecological restoration and sustainable development for the husbandry industry"" said An Fengjun deputy director of the management committee of Hainan green industrial development park.

The clean and renewable energy delivered every year through the line is equivalent to replacing 18 million tonnes of raw coal reducing 29.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide that is equivalent to adding more than 80000 hectares of forest. Enditem

Dubbing the 2021 event “Back on Track” more than 260 drivers showed up to Derby Downs in Akron to chase the championship title in the Super Car Super Stock and Master's divisions.

“The racing people consider Akron the Mecca of Soap Box Derby racing” said public relations chairman Bob Troyer. “Everybody who comes here earns the right to come here. It’s the culmination of all of their efforts to come here.”

Drivers from 35 different states were on hand to participate in the competition.

Madden Cleveland from Murfreesboro Tennessee was one of those drivers making his first appearance at the derby. He’s spent the last months fine tuning his derby car to prepare for the races.

“I put most of the weight in the front and in the back” he said. “Because if you put weight in the back and the front the front will push you forward a little and then in the back also pushes you down the hill.”

New this year are upgrades to sidewalks along the track that span the entire length of the raceway. The Soap Box Derby also repaved the entire track making for a faster and smoother ride

“It’s a really fun experience. It’s very fast. The second fastest track I’ve ever been on” Cleveland said.

But the event also draws in hundreds of families and brings a much-needed post-pandemic boost to Summit county.

“It’s an iconic event. So it represents itself. But it lets other events know that you can host world class events” said Gregg Mervis President and CEO of the Akron Summit Convention and Visitors Bureau. “We have the volunteer base the restaurants hotels museums access off the expressway. Everything people want to see; it just showcases that.”

But for the racers and volunteers who help the event run smoothly each year they’re just happy to be back on track.

“It’s like a big family here. The families who compete know each other because they’ve been doing it for a while” Troyer said. “Many of them go to the rallies around the country so they see each other several times a year.”

Stadium Info FANFARE Score: 3.86

ShoreTown Ballpark 2 Stadium Way Lakewood NJ 08701





Year Opened: 2001

Capacity: 6588





Down the Shore Everything’s Alright

The Jersey Shore Blue Claws baseball team plays their home games at FirstEnergy Park in Lakewood New Jersey. The team is the High-A affiliate of the Philadelphia Phillies and underwent a couple of key changes this past offseason (2020). One was a name change from Lakewood to Jersey Shore and the other was a change in the league from the South Atlantic League in Low-A to High-A East due to minor league’s realignment.

The Blue Claws were founded in 2001 and have showcased some of the Phillies premier prospects over the years including Cole Hamels and Rhys Hoskins. FirstEnergy Park holds 6588 fans plus additional space on the grass in the outfield and offers a truly unique game day experience.

Food & Beverage 3

FirstEnergy Park has numerous concession stands serving both food and drink. The main stands are the Coors Light Food Courts located on the left and right field lines. Food is divided into entrees and snacks/sides. A hot dog costs $5 a burger costs $7 and a veggie burger costs $8. Offerings also include Pork Roll Egg and Cheese (a local shore favorite) for $7 and chicken tenders and fries for $10. Sides include $6 onion rings $5 popcorn and peanuts and Cracker Jack for $4. Drinks are served at the food court as well as separate stands that serve alcohol and an ice cream stand for the kids. Ice cream comes in both cup ($6) and sundae ($8) form and has chocolate orange and vanilla flavors.

Local breweries Toms River Brewing and Pinelands Brewing Company are represented with a stand on the concourse behind home plate. The sandbar in left field is another option for adult beverages. An alcohol stand in right field offers Coors and Miller for $7 and Corona Blue Moon and White Claw for $8. Coca-Cola is the stadium’s main soda and is served for $5 at the food court. Concession stands accept both cash and credit/debit. I tried the chicken fingers with fries and they were very good not chewy or hard well cooked and the fries were crispy and tasty.

Atmosphere 5

Whether named Lakewood or Jersey Shore the Blue Claws have an unmatched atmosphere. FirstEnergy Park is laid out like most minor league stadiums obviously way larger than a high school field but nowhere near as big as a major league park. Reserved seating is available along the left and right field lines and behind home plate. The outfield is a grassy area where people are welcome to sit. There are also fire pits in the outfield and oversized beach chairs where people of all ages can sit although kids get more of a kick out of those than adults. Premium seats are located on the second deck. Everything is visible from any seat in the stadium; there are no seats that are obstructed. Any seat is prime foul ball territory as well so bring a glove. One deficiency is that free WiFi isn’t available at the park.

The Blue Claws mascot is Buster a Philly Phanatic-inspired character that is of an unknown species. Despite his undefined genus Buster elicits responses from kids that are akin to a Beatles concert in 1964 meaning they go absolutely bonkers for him. The PA announcer at the stadium has a clear voice and isn’t over the top; he doe his job without making a clown of himself. Music played between innings is classic rock. It is interesting to note that rap and country are not played at all despite being oft-played at other sporting venues. After weekend games live music is played in the Sand Bar in left field and special promotions include musical chairs to Dead tunes and the classic pork roll egg and cheese eyeball races.

In terms of seating there isn’t a bad seat in the house for a night game. However for a day game it may be better to sit further up due to the lack of cover from a second deck on most of the seats.

Neighborhood 2

FirstEnergy Park is located in a fast developing corner of an increasingly overdeveloped town of Lakewood New Jersey. Once a secluded resort amongst the pines Lakewood has become a haven for the Orthodox Jewish community in the last twenty years. The stadium complex now features three office buildings and across Route 528 a new housing complex and shopping malls have cropped up including a QuickChek convenience store.

The night of the game Stadium Journey attended downtown Lakewood was a ghost town due to it being the day of Shabbat or sabbath in the Jewish faith. That being said it’s not like Lakewood is a hub of nightlife any other day of the week. Lakewood is a heavily religious community and excessive hedonism is not in the cards.

However the allure of attending a Blue Claws game is proximity to the shore. Blue Claws games take place in the summer and the summer population at the shore is swelled due to an influx of tourists from both the New York and Philadelphia metro areas. Attractions entertainment and food near Lakewood all fall to the communities on the shore like Belmar Seaside Heights and Asbury Park which are all twenty or more miles away. Asbury Park features the legendary concert venue the Stone Pony as well as trendy restaurants like Porta and the Robinson Ale House. Six Flags Great Adventure is in neighboring Jackson also about 15 minutes from the ballpark.

In terms of hotel accommodations there is a Hilton Garden Inn located on Route 70 in Lakewood and a Ramada further down 70 in Toms River. Hotels are way more common at the shore with bed and breakfasts motels and upscale hotels like the Asbury in Asbury Park.

Fans 4

The Jersey Shore Blue Claws have led the South Atlantic League in attendance almost every season since their inception. The game attended by Stadium Journey was packed but a majority of the fans were deadheads acolytes of the legendary rock band the Grateful Dead at the game for the sole reason of listening to Dead cover band Splintered Sunlight. There was a large cluster of fans in left field at the concert who were not seated in their assigned seats watching the game. That being said I’ve been to Blue Claws games in the past where the stands were full and fans were loud throughout the entire game so this game was an anomaly and not the norm.

Access 4

FirstEnergy Park is very accessible both in terms of getting to the stadium and moving around the stadium once inside. In terms of mass transit the stadium is accessible by car from both major cities of New York and Philadelphia it is a mere five minutes from the Garden State Parkway. However the stadium isn’t on one of NJ Transit’s train lines. Technically the nearest airport to the park is the Lakewood Municipal Airport but the park is less than an hour away from Newark and Atlantic City airports as well as a little over an hour away from Philadelphia International Airport as well as JFK and LaGuardia in New York. Parking options are immense and parking costs a mere $5.

There was a line to get in before the game to get it but it moved extremely fast. Tickets can be bought online or in-person before the game and tickets are scanned both on phones and with hard copies. People with bags are subjected to a bag check as they enter the stadium.

The concourse is crowded and concession lines are long at times but moved quickly and efficiently. The main concourse has a view of the playing field and features numerous sections of handicap-accessible seating as well as handicap-accessible parking spaces.

Return on Investment 4

When you attend a Jersey Shore Blue Claws game you are getting your money’s worth. The in-game entertainment game atmosphere and hospitality are well worth the price of admission. Reserved seats cost $16 each in advance and $18 on the day of the game Diamond Deck club seating is $35 in advance and $40 the day of the game and private outfield fire pits are $90. $10 for chicken fingers or $5 for a hot dog is nothing compared to other college and professional stadiums. Programs are fully online and aren’t sold at the game.

Extras 5

FirstEnergy Park features a nine-hole mini golf course in right field and a kids zone in center field with carnival style games like basketball for prizes and a “test your pitch velocity” game. There is a bearded ticket taker in a red shirt with the name tag “Santa Claws.” The Claws Cove a merchandise shop behind home plate sells jerseys bats and a plush of the team mascot Buster. There is the retired number of former Phillies pitcher Cole Hamels in center field. The club wears Grateful Dead theme tie-dye jerseys. The friendly staff and ushers make an effort to make visitors feel welcome.

(WBKO) - A Bowling Green teen has placed first in the nation in the Local Super Stock Division at the 83rd FirstEnergy All-American Soap Box Derby World Championship in Akron Ohio.

Nathen Christian 16 was one of more than 270 boys and girls from across the United States to take place in the competition. It was held at the world-famous Derby Downs track.

Racers between the ages of 7-20 spend months building their racecars which are motorless vehicles powered by gravity that are raced downhill. They compete in local Soap Box Derby competitions to earn their trip to the World Championships. The BB&T All-American Soap Box Derby was held May 14-15 at Phil Moore Park in Bowling Green.

Upon winning the national title Christian was overcome with emotion calling it a dream come true. “Since 2013 I’ve dreamed of this...I worked my butt off. It’s a lot of determination patience. I just stayed composed throughout the whole week...man that’s all it takes you know?” said Christian. He thanked his supporters at home. “I did this for y’all.”

According to soapboxderby.org Bowling Green has a long history of Soap Box Derby Racing beginning in 1938 famously racing down the steep hill of College Street. Kiwanis Club of Bowling Green brought back the local race in 1998 and it consistently ranks as one of the largest local races in the world.

Many others placed in their divisions at the All-American Soap Box Derby World Championship. Cameron Martin placed 2nd in Local Masters Kelsey Sanford placed 3rd in the Local Stock Division and Chase Schlafke placed 8th in the Rally Super Stock.

These four were celebrated at Hillvue Heights Church Sunday with a police escort leading them back into town.

For the first time in the championship’s 83 year history no local race city has had three local champions in the top three.

Christian says he will try and defend his title at next year’s event.

Despite hardy efforts no local racers progressed past the first round in the Local Challenge Series.

After Wednesday’s Local Challenge races concluded an All-Star race was held. Only 18 cars in each class qualified based on the number of first-place wins during the racing season with a maximum of three from each region.

Owensboro was represented by Brayden Locher in Stock and Halee Jo McDaniel in Super Stock. While both won phases neither progressed to the next round.

July 15 — Only 52 Americans qualified for the FirstEnergy All-American Soap Box Derby World Championships taking place next week — and 10 of them are from Owensboro. The youngsters will travel to Akron Ohio to compete in the week-long event.

This marks the 83rd year for the event that offers six opportunities for participants to be crowned “World Champions.” Individuals can qualify by winning their local race or by accumulating 600 points in rally races that are hosted across the country.

Representing Owensboro as local champions are Kierra Johnson Andrew Meyer and Braden Locher. Local members of the 600-point club that will be competing for the rally race crown include Ryan Locher Halee Jo McDaniel Dawson Gordon Addison Locher Benji Edds Zach Gordon and Sadie Meyer.

The cars will arrive in Akron ahead of the participants so they can undergo an intense inspection to ensure that every component of the cars is identical — including every last nut bolt and washer.

The races will begin on Tuesday and Wednesday. Racers will compete in groups of three as opposed to the traditional two at smaller tracks. They will go down the hill three separate times and calculate the average of their times to determine who advances."

The Milwaukee Bucks ran celebrations all around the city two days after winning the NBA championship. They had one of the hardest playoff journeys and ended it with a chip to their name. Giannis Antetokounmpo received the honors of Finals MVP for his outstanding performances on both ends of the floor.

Milwaukee successfully ended a 50 year championship drought in the city by winning against the Suns. They did not give up at any step of the way.

Notably in their series against the Brooklyn Nets no one expected the Bucks to get past the stacked Nets. However they kept fighting and went on to win the series in a thrilling 7 games.

Moreover even in the NBA finals they were down 0-2. But Giannis Antetokounmpo and his men kept their nerves and trusted their abilities.

They followed their losses with 4 straight wins to lift the Larry O’Brien trophy. Giannis made the finals his own as he averaged 35 points 13 rebounds and almost 2 blocks per game.

Moreover Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday proved their worth big time in these playoffs stepping up in the important moments. While talking to The Athletic Giannis Antetokounmpo opened up about the Bucks’ challenging journey throughout these playoffs.

‘Starting From the Bottom’: Hall of Famer Isiah Thomas Praises Giannis Antetokounmpo for His Loyal Run With Milwaukee Bucks

Giannis Antetokounmpo says everyone underestimated the Bucks

Giannis spoke about how the people wrote off Milwaukee thinking they are not a top level team. However the Bucks worked hard throughout the season and were prepared for the battle of their lives. The Freak spoke about how everyone thought he could not pass and did not expect teammates Holiday and Middleton to be this good. He said:

“First of all let’s start with this motherf**kers did not know I could pass because I was never at that level. We were never at the top level so they could see. So now they were able to experience how good Khris (Middleton) is how good Jrue (Holiday) is how good I am how smart we are. That’s it.”

Mandatory Credit: Jeff Hanisch-USA TODAY Sports

Giannis was amazing at spacing the floor in the playoffs this season. Notably he averaged 5 assists per game in the finals.

Khris Middleton solidified himself as a bucket and clutch player through their journey. From scoring 32 points against the Hawks in Giannis’ absence to scoring 40 points in an NBA finals he did it all. He was their primary scorer in the 4th and Antetokounmpo learnt to work with that.

While Middleton and Giannis Antetokounmpo took lead on the offensive end Jrue Holiday was all about defence. He did not have a great Finals in terms of scoring.

However his defence was pivotal in the Bucks winning a championship. He averaged 2 steals through the finals. In addition he put up 16 points per game.

To sum it up the Milwaukee Bucks wrote their own destiny and worked hard to get there. Giannis Antetokounmpo & co have now proved that they are a team to look out for. Now with the off season the Bucks could add more firepower in their roster and compete for yet another championship.

Do you think the Bucks can go back to back?

The bench agreed to give four more weeks to the FMC to complete the task.At this juncture senior advocate Colin Gonsalves drew the court’s attention to RTI information obtained by IAS officer Ashok Khemka relating to the existence of a large number of farm houses commercial establishments including hotels and religious structures inside the forest land around Khori village. “The eviction law should apply equally to the poor and rich and an impression should not go to the public that while the poor settlers were evicted the rich continue to live in luxurious farmhouses” he said.The bench said that the order applied with equal rigour to all kinds of encroachments on the forest land. ""Needless to observe that order for removal of all unauthorised structures will apply to all illegal structures without exception including the structures already identified by the Haryana forest minister Kanwar Pal. It (removal) shall be done within the extended time (of four weeks)” the bench said.Importantly the court allowed the Khori village residents to give representation for modifications in the draft Rehabilitation Policy 2021 framed by the FMC. The earlier rehabilitation policy had fixed 2003 as the cutoff date for the Khori village residents to claim rehabilitation relief by the government. The past policy envisaged that those who had proof of residence in Khori village prior to 2003 would be entitled to alternative accommodation.The SC asked the FMC to consider the representation of the villagers on modifications in the 2021 rehabilitation policy within seven days and notify the finalised policy by July 31 so as to enable the villagers to challenge if need be the validity of the new policy before the apex court.Appearing for few other Khori villagers senior advocate Sanjay Parikh complained to the court that though the houses are getting demolished the FMC was not providing the affected with temporary shelters even during the monsoon period causing a lot of hardship to a large number of people. FMC counsel said the corporation was providing them with temporary shelters and amenities. SC allowed the residents to approach the commissioner of FMC with complaints and asked the authorities to give reasons in every case where the temporary shelter and other facilities are not being extended to the evicted people.However the bench said it would not be feasible for the FMC to give advance notice of eviction to the villagers after FMC counsel pointed out that the area is sensitive and untoward incidents could happen if a specific date for demolition drive in a particular area was notified. “Each and every villager whose house is on forest land has been told repeatedly since the SC passed the order on June 7 that they would be evicted. Every villager knows that they would be evicted. Additional notice would not be required to be given” Bhardwaj said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

""The financing was led by Amazon’s Climate Pledge Fund D1 Capital Partners Ford Motor Company and funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates Inc. This round included participation by Third Point Fidelity Management and Research Company Dragoneer Investment Group and Coatue.""

Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe explains that the vehicle production is near and that the funds will allow moving to the next phase of growth which includes ""scale new vehicle programs"" plus ""expand our domestic facility footprint"" (a second factory is in the pipeline potentially for vehicles and batteries) and ""fuel international product rollout"" (Europe was already confirmed).

We are of course the most curious about the ""new vehicle programs"" on top of the R1T R1S and electric vans for Amazon.

Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe said:

“As we near the start of vehicle production it’s vital that we keep looking forward and pushing through to Rivian’s next phase of growth.

On its website car manufacturer Changan traces its own history back to the year 1862. That is more than 20 years before Karl Benz invented the car. Of course more companies first made other products before they ventured into cars but Changan pushes the limit. Only over a century after the Benz Patent Motorwagen the Chinese company gets serious about car production.

So what important stuff went down in 1862 that the brand considers its roots? Well in that year Li Hongzhang founded the Foreign Gun Bureau in Shanghai. Li Hongzhang was a politician and army chief in the last imperial dynasty that ruled China the Qing dynasty. At the time that dynasty had to contend with internal unrest European settlers and Japanese invasions so a steady influx of weapons and ammunition served them well. The Shanghai Federal Gun Bureau was established to import all kinds of weaponry from abroad. Li Hongzhang was also quite an interesting figure who influenced Chinese history but after the establishment of the arms trade he had little more to do with it. If you are interested in the man I refer you to Wikipedia.

Circumstances forced the arms trade to first move to Suzhou and then to Nanjing where the company changed the name to Jialing Machinery Manufacturing Bureau. In addition to the arms trade it also took up production there. In the war with the French (1884-85) and the first war with the Japanese (1894-95) the Jialing arms factory was an important supplier to the Qing dynasty.

In 1937 the Japanese invaded China again and then they manage to occupy a large territory including Shanghai which is not too far from Nanjing. For security reasons the arms factory is once again moved to the city of Chongqing in central China. The factory will be known there as 21st Arsenal. After the Second World War the Japanese disappeared from the scene again and in 1949 the communists took power in China. These place the 21st Arsenal under the control of the Ministry of Military Industry which in turn is part of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA). The Arsenal also gets a new name: Central Ordnance General Administration’s 456th Plant.

So we are still talking about a weapons and ammunition factory here but at the end of the 1950s the 456th PLA factory builds cars for a while. Initially they assemble some Willy’s Jeeps from captured vehicles and parts but the factory also develops its own design based on the iconic Jeep. In 1957 the production of an off-roader called Changjiang 46 starts and to celebrate the vent the company’s name changes again. Henceforth it will be called Changan Machinery Manufacturing Plant.

Changjiang built the off-roader in 1963 and a total of 1400 copies roll out of the factory. Then the whole production line is packed and moved to Beijing. The Changjiang continues to be produced there but now by Beijing Automobile Works and forms the starting point of Beijing Auto’s history. The Changjiang is the predecessor of the iconic BJ212 which is produced until today. Changan itself returns to arms production.

At that time those in power divided the Chinese defense industry into five major groups (weaponry shipbuilding aircraft construction aerospace and nuclear technology) each with an umbrella holding company. In Changan’s case it’s the China Ordnance Industry Corporation which handles arms production. Incidentally that holding should be seen in the light of the Chinese planned economy. It is controlled by the PLA administration and influences the distribution of money resources and tasks but does not directly control the dozens of companies and factories located throughout China.

The times are changing

In the 1960s and ’70s China fell into a period of civil unrest political assassinations economic decline and finally famine as a result of Mao Zedong’s ‘Cultural Revolution’ the policy to rid the country of all revisionist thinking and establish a communist society according to Mao’s Little Red Book. These were hard times for ordinary citizens but great times for the weapons industry. After Mao died in 1976 more moderate leaders control the Communist Party and things start to change rapidly.

The new leaders restore calm and peace and instigate sweeping economic modernization. It’s good news for most Chinese except for the weapons industry. That business goes into decline and the China Ordnance Industry Corporation is looking for other options to keep their factories running. In the early 1980’s it reaches an agreement with car manufacturer Suzuki about the licensed production of Japanese cars for the local market.

The agreement is shared with another group in the defense industry China Aviation Industry. Both groups distribute the license across many of their factories. The weapons division will make Changan Huaihai Qinchuan Jiangnan and Jiangbei Suzukis while the aviation companies will make the cars in the Changhe Yunque Hafei and Dongan factories. In addition to this list of licensed builders several companies make illegal copies. They all tend to make the same two Suzukis: the 2nd-generation Alto or the 8th-generation Carry/Every.

Building a corporation

It soon becomes clear that amongst those factories Changan is taking the lead. The military command merges Changan with another weapons maker with a very similar history the Jiangling Machinery Manufacturing Plant which will produce engines. The joint company is called Changan Automobile Group the first step in becoming a real automaker. Trial Production begins the late 80s and from about 1989 the Carry by Changan goes on sale in China. So to come back to the opening paragraph that’s 130 years after establishing the Shanghai arms trade. Decide for yourself whether the Changan website exaggerates the ‘heritage’ of the brand a bit.

In the next years Changan starts building a corporate structure. The first development is a joint venture with Suzuki that I will address shortly. In October 1996 Changan Automobile Group established an intermediate holding company called Chongqing Changan Automobile. An important part of the automotive activities is housed including the joint venture with Suzuki. This intermediate holding is then floated on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange in May 1997 with Changan Automobile Group trading approximately 32% of its shares. Suzuki is one of the buyers.

Let’s go back to the defense industry for one last time. As mentioned the Chinese government had clustered the industry into five groups but at the end of the 1990s it thought it was time for a thorough reorganization. To increase the efficiency and speed of innovation each of the five groups is split into two parts which have to compete with each other. The China Ordnance Industry Corporation is divided into China North Industry Group Corporation and China South Industry Group Corporation. Changan becomes part of the ‘southern’ part. It might be worth noting that China-South is still active in the arms industry but Changan’s cars and Jialing’s motorcycles (another company in the group) are just as important. In addition China South is also active in robotics solar panels and medicine just to name a few things. To be clear the China-South Group is still wholly owned by the Chinese central government.

About ten years later the Changan company gets its current structure. At the time the company wants a part of China’s fast-growing passenger car market with its own brand. It builds a new factory in Nanjing and at the end of 2005 a reorganization and recapitalization of the company follow. China South Industries Group creates a new daughter organization China Changan Automobile Group that acquires all shares in Chongqing Changan (the car-producing entity) from the existing holding Changan Industry Group. China Changan thus becomes the new controlling shareholder of Chongqing Changan and its extensive network of companies in parts manufacturing financial and commercial services. The ‘old’ Changan Industry Group still exists but now mainly focuses on the defense industry while it also continues to make some auto parts.

At the end of this article I’ve added a corporate chart explaining Changan’s corporate structure.

Changan and Suzuki

Suzuki quickly discovers Changan is doing a thorough job and the two parties form a full-fledged joint venture in June 1993 which includes a newly built factory. The first result is that Changan will also build the Alto. The cars are badged Changan–Suzuki and carry type designations like City Baby and Happy Prince. The Swift is added to the line-up not much later but it is only provided with Suzuki logos.

The next passenger cars are all sold through the Suzuki sales channels while the Changan Alto continues until 2008. In the minivan department things are different. Changan utilizes Suzuki technology but creates its own design and bodies and sells the cars under the Changan brand. The first such car is the Zhixing (or Chana Star in export markets). The range will eventually sprawl into a large number of different variants and sizes. The minivans are a great commercial success.

The production of commercial vehicles is further expanded through a joint venture with the Kuayue real estate group also based in Chongqing. Changan Kuayue operates in the budget market with very cheap minivans and mini trucks often based on older Changan models.

To solidify its leading position in the small commercial vehicle field Changan took over the entire automotive industry from the China Aviation Industry in 2009. These are Changhe Hafei and Dongan. As we know Changhe and Hafei are two of the car manufacturers that also started building Suzuki’s under license. They also mainly make variants of the Carry. Changhe like Changan even has a full joint venture with the Japanese. Dongan does not make cars but is the engine factory for Hafei and various other Chinese manufacturers.

The marriage between Changhe and Changan is tense from the start. Changan management plans to merge the two joint ventures with Suzuki and integrate Changhe’s own production into the parent group. Changhe’s managers don’t like the idea and are fiercely resisting. This leads to a long and heated quarrel between the two managements. Ultimately the Jiangxi provincial government where Changhe is located forces a solution. Changhe is detached from Changan in 2013 after which Jiangxi Province largely sells the company to BAIC Group where it seems to have a healthy future.

The takeover of Hafei is not going much better at least for the company Hafei. Soon after the takeover the Hafei car brand is dissolved by Changan management and the parent company takes over the freed production capacity. The largest plant in northern Harbin is assigned to the Changan’s joint venture with Ford.

For Dongan the takeover is a much happier affair. The company mainly makes smaller engines (up to about 1.5 liters) of course initially based on Suzuki technology and grows under Changan into an important player in the market. Today it supplies engines to all kinds of Chinese manufacturers.

The joint venture between Changan and Suzuki operates quite successfully for almost 25 years but in 2018 the Japanese brand suddenly decides to leave the Chinese market entirely. They sell back their share in the joint venture to Changan but grant the Chinese permission to produce several models (S-Cross Vitara and Alivio) under license until 2023. China Changan transfers more than half of its shares in Chongqing Changan to parent company China South Industry Group to finance the stock buy-back. As a result China South becomes the controlling shareholder of the Changan car company.

Changan and Ford – Mazda

In 2001 Changan expanded passenger car production by entering into a joint venture with Ford Motor Co. Initially the joint venture produces the Fiesta quickly followed by the Mondeo and Focus. Over time Ford gradually adds more models including popular crossover vehicles and even the ‘only for China’ Escort.

At the time Ford is still part-owner of Mazda so the joint venture also starts making the 2- and 3-series from the Japanese. These cars share their platform with the Ford Fiesta and Focus so it’s a logical progression. Ford even adds a third Focus-derivative the Volvo S40 and later the Mondeo-based Volvo S80.

During the credit crisis of 2008 Ford gets in financial difficulties and is forced to sell off several subsidiaries. That includes Volvo and Mazda. Volvo is of course taken over by Geely so Changan’s involvement with the brand is short-lived although the S80 is produced for a while after Volvo changes hands.

Ford and Mazda went their separate ways in 2012. This is also reflected in China. Mazda is removed from the joint venture with Ford but immediately starts its own new joint venture with Changan. As a result the various models remain in production during the transition in January 2013.

Ford recovers quickly from the economic downturn and the brand does quite well for a while in the Chinese market. It even adds another model especially for China the Taurus a nameplate that the company dropped in its home market. But the good times do not last. Around 2018 Ford sales start to drop significantly. The company needs to revive its line-up and introduces more SUVs. In 2020 the production of the first Lincoln model starts in China and two more up-market models follow it. So far the Chinese-built Lincolns are quite successful commercially.

The joint venture with Mazda is a rather low-key affair. The company mainly produces the Mazda3 Axela and the CX-5. Mazda’s more important joint venture in China is with FAW making the Mazda6 and several crossovers. But lately Mazda has sees its sales drop off and some rumors are going around that the Japanese intent to merge the two joint ventures. We’ll see what comes of that.

Changan and PSA

In 2011 Peugeot-Citroen spun off DS as a separate brand and China is the main target. Although Dongfeng builds the French cars for China PSA chooses Changan for the DS brand and sets up a new joint venture. A new factory is being built in Shenzhen and initially the introduction of the quirky DS models is fairly successful.

However the success doesn’t last. PSA makes quite a mess of its operations in China and the once very well-known brands Peugeot and Citroen are declining quickly from 2018 onwards. DS is pulled down with it to the extent that PSA no longer sees any future in its joint venture with Changan. In 2020 Changan and PSA sold the whole operation to a Hong Kong-based real estate group called Baoneng. Baoneng Group had already acquired the Qoros brand and will produce those cars in the Shenzhen factory. Meanwhile it continues to make some DS models for PSA including the brand new DS9.

Incidentally the cooperation between Changan and PSA is not completely over. The two companies have jointly developed a pickup truck in recent years. It is marketed in China by Changan Kaicheng but a variant with Peugeot badging will be sold in South America.

Changan self-branded cars

With all the talk about joint ventures you might wonder where Changan’s own cars are. Yes I’ve mentioned the self-developed light commercial vehicles but these don’t make you China’s biggest brand. So where’s the magic happening?

I’m afraid I’ve got to mention one more joint venture. Early in 2004 Changan started a joint venture with Jiangling Motor Co. (JMC) a truck maker. Together they set up Jiangling Motor Holding carrying its own passenger cars brand: Landwind. For both companies it’s the first independent attempt at self-developed passenger cars. Although Changan is a 50% shareholder Jiangling Holding is mainly a vehicle for JMC products and the history of the company will be the subject of a future article. Changan must gain some experience.

A few paragraphs back I mentioned the Changan company was restructured and recapitalized in 2005. That provided the much-needed foundation for Changan’s foray into independent auto-making. Changan eyed a piece of the explosively growing domestic market. Its first product the BenBen (loosely based on the 7th generation Suzuki Alto) hits the market in 2006 and is followed by an entire range of affordable but apparently well-made sedans. The sub-compact Yuexiang (Alsvin) the compact Zhixiang the highly successful Eado and the larger Raeton all follow in quick succession. Changan’s biggest achievement is picking up the SUV hype early on. By the mid-2010s it has a complete line-up of crossovers just as the hype takes off.

Many Chinese brands create a sub-brand for each market niche. Changan sells all its cars under its own name. It helps to strengthen the brand name. Since 2017 the company does market its products through four more or less independent sales channels. The regular line-up of passenger cars is sold through Changan Automobile. Changan Oushang sells mainly low-cost SUVs and MPVs aimed at a younger and less affluent audience. This comes close to a sub-brand by the way. The Oushang cars have a different logo and badging. Changan Kaicheng is the commercial vehicle division and sells minibusses vans and pickups. Finally there is a premium section called Changan UNI. Their first model the good-looking UNI-T has been off to a flying start.

The secret of Changan’s success? Well I can’t put my finger on it but I guess it will be a combination of well-made cars and value for money.

What’s been missing so far is a competitive line of New Energy Vehicles. Changan has the occasional hybrid and electric car but so far nothing groundbreaking. They’re playing catch up but even then it seems they can do nothing wrong. Changan recently introduced the BenBen E-star based on an almost obsolete Suzuki Celerio. Still the car is making inroads in the “very cheap EV”-segment dominated by the Wuling Hongguang Mini EV.

So the competition better watches out for Changan’s latest endeavor. They used to have a (yet another) joint venture with NIO to develop EV technology but that company has produced nothing to speak of. Recently NIO mostly withdrew from the joint venture and Changan will transform it for their upcoming premium EV. Late last year they announced cooperation with Huawei and CATL form a yet unnamed new brand of high-performance EV’s using the latest autonomous technology. Don’t be surprised if Changan conquers that segment as well.

China South Industries Group Corporation

Immense state-owned conglomerate with many dozens of subsidiaries. Traditionally engaged in the weapons and ammunition industry but nowadays also quite large in cars (Changan) and motorcycles (Jialing). They also make robots solar panels and medicines among other things.

Chongqing Changan Industry Group Co. Ltd. (CCIG)

Until the end of 2005 this company was the parent company of Chongqing Changan. Then CCIG transferred the automaker’s shares to China Changan. Changan Industry is currently mainly active in the defense industry (they make all kinds of bombs among other things) and has a small division that is engaged in auto parts production.

China Changan Automobile Group Co. Ltd.

Since the end of 2005 the parent company of Chongqing Changan China Changan also owns the Hafei Industry the merger of Hafei Motor and Harbin Dongan. Hafei Motor makes cars for Changan Ford. In addition to the listed companies China Changan also has a long list of active parts manufacturing commercial and financial services for the automotive industry and logistics/transportation.

Chongqing Changan Automobile Co. Ltd.

In addition to the headquarters and main development department Chongqing Changan also includes huge industrial complexes in Chongqing where many of Changan’s cars are produced.

Nanjing/Hebei/Hefei Changan Automobile Co. Ltd.

Changan manufacturing sites outside of Chongqing.

Chongqing Changan Suzuki Automobile Co. Ltd.

Until 2018 this was a joint venture with the Japanese Suzuki. Suzuki has since withdrawn from the company and has become a production location for Changan. However the company may in any case continue to make Suzukis for the Chinese market under license until 2023.

Baoding Changan Bus Co. Ltd.

Not mentioned in the above article but in addition to passenger and commercial vehicles Changan also makes buses. The exact history of this company is not entirely clear to me yet but it seems that Changan has been making buses on a small scale from its beginning in the automotive industry. Since 2005 the division is detached as a standalone company and makes mainly school buses and buses for public transport.

Chongqing Changan New Energy Automobile Technology Co. Ltd.

Changan’s electric car development department. Changan NE also produces battery packs and electric motors in-house. Founded in 2008 and 2018 Changan NE attracted some strategic investors.

Changan also has another joint venture (not shown in the diagram) with BYD for battery development and manufacturing. I can’t say for sure which company within Changan is the partner yet but I suspect it will be Changan NE.

Changan Ford Automobile Co. Ltd.

A joint venture between Changan and the American Ford Motor Company. This company makes Ford cars for the Chinese market. Besides global models passed on from the US or EU market it also makes two special cars for China: the Escort and Taurus.

The market reaction to this seems moderately positive for the time being.

Changan Mazda Automobile Co. Ltd. / Changan Mazda Engine Co. Ltd.

Joint ventures between Changan and the Japanese Mazda. The former company makes many Mazda models for the Chinese market. The second company of course makes engines. Derivatives of the Mazda engines can also be found in the cars Changan markets under its own name.

In 2019 startup Aiways took over a controlling share from both partners to obtain a production license to make their own cars. Before the acquisition Jiangling removed the production of JMC cars from the joint venture but Jiangling Holding will continue to produce Landwind’s.

The automaker’s taking action to protect the Cruise and Super-Cruise brands after Ford in April renamed its Co-Pilot360 automated driving system as Blue Cruise GM said in court documents filed Friday. Talks to resolve the issue had been unsuccessful the firm said.

The claim by GM is “meritless and frivolous"" Ford spokesman Mike Levine said in an emailed statement. “Drivers for decades have understood what cruise control is every automaker offers it and ‘cruise’ is common shorthand for the capability.""

In documents filed with the U.S. District Court Northern District of California a unit of Detroit-based GM said “Ford knew exactly what it was doing.""

“If Ford wanted to adopt a new unique brand it easily could have done so without using the word ‘Cruise’"" GM said in the filing.

GM first introduced Super Cruise which allows drivers to take their hands off the wheel for brief periods on the Cadillac CT6 in 2017. Since then the company has expanded the technology to allow cars to change lanes on their own and plans to offer the feature on more models.

The feature also shares a name with Cruise LLC the self-driving car startup that’s majority-controlled by GM.

“While GM had hoped to resolve the trademark infringement matter with Ford amicably we were left with no choice but to vigorously defend our brands"" GM said in an emailed statement.

Hotly Contested

Semi-autonomous features like hands-free driving and crash-avoidance technology have become hotly contested battle grounds as automakers seek to boost prices best rivals with options that command a premium and give drivers high-tech bragging rights.

They’re also seen as gateway to getting consumers comfortable with self-driving cars a space where automotive and tech companies are spending billions in the hopes of unlocking profits from robotaxis and delivery services.

Ford unveiled plans last year to offer its Blue Cruise hands-free driving technology on its F-150 pickup the top-selling vehicle in America. It’s also offering Blue Cruise as an over-the-air software update on its electric Mustang Mach-E.

Terralogic Acquires Security Operations Center (SOC) Expertise

Terralogic has M&A experience. The company acquired AforeCybersec for security operations center (SOC) expertise in 2019.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vYmVybmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMS8wNy9kaWdpY2VsLWxhdW5jaGVzLWN5YmVyc2VjdXJpdHktc2VydmljZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Digicel Launches Cybersecurity Service,"Digicel has launched a new cybersecurity service titled Digicel Business Protect representing a partnership between Digicel Business Solutions Fortinet HyperProtect IBM SentinelOne MetaCompliance and Cisco.

A spokesperson said “Many businesses have a tendency to treat cybersecurity in the same way as insurance – only deeming it necessary when it’s too late. That’s the alarming takeaway from the latest Digicel Business research into pandemic business drivers and challenges.

“With Spilt Milk Syndrome worryingly prevalent in businesses of all sizes the pandemic has exposed the vulnerabilities in many business’ virtual front lines. In focusing on rapidly and dramatically adapting their business models to be able to stay in business many organisations have overlooked the pressures that these changes have placed on traditional systems infrastructure.

“They do so at their peril. With more and more people working online remotely existing systems originally designed for office environments are under strain and unchecked growth is opening up infrastructure to potential disaster.

“And to put a dollar value on that disaster; if it were measured as a country then cybercrime which is predicted to inflict damages totaling a staggering US$6 trillion globally in 2021 would be the world’s third-largest economy after the U.S. and China.1 And it’s an ‘economy’ that is growing at a blistering 15% per year. Ouch.

“Yet with many businesses unfortunately taking a very simplistic view of their data assets and systems without much consideration of their value to outsiders having the right levels of online protection often falls down the to-do list. Coupled with the ever-increasing sophistication of hackers and the breadth and depth of threats businesses are faced with a daunting and complex mountain to climb. That’s where Digicel Business can help.

“On July 15th and 16th Digicel Bermuda’s Head of Business Kevin Beckett welcomed Hyper Sync’s Cyber Security Director Douglas Thomas to their offices to host a two day event. The event was focused on ensuring every business had the tools it needed to coup with cyber-attacks before it was too late.”

Mr. Beckett said “We here at Digicel Business Solutions are delighted to formally launch our new Cyber Security practise. Digicel Business Protect is a new standalone unit which is a partnership between Digicel Business Solutions Fortinet HyperProtect IBM SentinelOne MetaCompliance and Cisco.

“We are pleased to offer our clients services which will initially include: Breach & Threat detection SIEM and Managed SOC Endpoint Protection Penetration Testing and Managed Firewall.”

The spokesperson said “Digicel Business’s full suite of Threat management Breach Detection Penetration and Endpoint Management services provide business customers with everything they need to stay safe and stay in the game.

“Talk to a security expert today when you call 500-5600.”

What the network might not have expected was for the message to be almost immediately undermined by the network’s biggest star Tucker Carlson.

It looked like an onscreen real-time battle between Fox News and Carlson who has previously challenged the safety and questioned the effectiveness of the coronavirus vaccine that pointed to wider mixed messaging at the network over the issue of vaccination.

It was also a conflict that played out as the more contagious Delta variant of Covid-19 is spreading rapidly through areas of America where unvaccinated people are concentrated which are often Republican-supporting – and Fox-watching – states.

Since vaccines became commonly available in the US key opinion hosts on the rightwing news channel have repeatedly cast doubt on vaccination.

Laura Ingraham has proved to be a vaccine skeptic questioning the vaccine’s efficacy this week while in a two-week period from 28 June to 11 July Fox News personalities and guests ​​made a total of 216 claims undermining or downplaying vaccines in segments about coronavirus immunization according to Media Matters.

There has been a shift in some of Fox News’ coverage in the past week however. First Sean Hannity on Monday told his viewers to “please take Covid seriously – I can’t say it enough.”

Hannity added: “I believe in the science of vaccination.”

Hannity had previously made a similar comment – although it was also qualified with an exhortation to “talk to your doctor” – but this one came during a week in which Fox News launched its new public service announcement headlined on Fox News’ website as: “‘We’re in this together’: Fox News hosts urge Americans to get the vaccine” on Wednesday.

“America we’re in this together” Steve Doocy one of the co-hosts of the Fox & Friends morning show duly tells the viewer. We then see the daytime host Harris Faulkner who adds: “And if you can get the vaccine.” The video directs its viewers to a CDC link on the Fox News website where they can search for vaccination sites near them.

That was all well and good except Carlson Fox News’ most-watched host popped up an hour after the PSA aired to evacuate all over the sentiment.

Carlson who has been doing good business with far-right conservatives through his repeated questioning of the vaccine seemingly used CNN which has also encouraged its viewers to get vaccinated as a proxy for Fox News in an indignant monologue.

“As a channel CNN shouldn’t have a position on whether you should take medicine or not because it’s a news channel it’s not a health agency” Carlson said.

He later added: “Why is a news channel doing this? Any news channel. A lot of them are.”

The hoo-ha came a couple of days after Ingraham who hosts a show called The Ingraham Angle asked her viewers: “What about the efficacy of the vaccine itself among adults?” Ingraham pointed out that five vaccinated Texas Democrats had tested positive for coronavirus.

“We have to know more about that” Ingraham said.

The mixed messaging was the latest clash of thinking within Fox News over vaccines.

Carlson has howled on his show that the idea of vaccine passports is the medical equivalent of “Jim Crow” laws but against the dystopian picture of huddled masses presenting barcodes to emotionless big state bureaucrats is the reality that Fox has already implemented its own version of a vaccine passport among its staff.

An email sent to Fox Corporation staff including Fox News employees at the end of June said the company had “developed a secure voluntary way for employees to self-attest their vaccination status” according to CNN.

Staff are encouraged to report the dates they received the vaccine and their vaccine status. If they could prove to Fox that they were fully vaccinated they are eligible for the “Fox Clear Pass”. With the Fox Clear Pass staff are able to bypass an otherwise obligatory daily health screening CNN reported.

A Fox News spokeswoman pointed to examples of some of its hosts and journalists expressing support for vaccines and to a Fox News PSA from 2 February that showed Faulkner telling viewers “if you can get the vaccine”.

There are caveats however to at least some Fox News hosts’ apparent enthusiasm for the vaccine. After Hannity was praised by non-rightwing media for his seemingly pro-vaccine stance he angrily told viewers on Thursday: “I never told anyone to get a vaccine.”

And even Hannity’s – brief – encouragement of the vaccine was couched with him telling people they should speak to their doctor before getting it a caveat that seemed like a sop to vaccine skeptics. In the US where the majority of people have to pay to see a doctor consulting a medical professional can be a serious obstacle.

The questioning of vaccines by some Fox News hosts and other rightwing networks “[is] about ratings and ratings ultimately become revenue and that’s the name of the game” Carl Cameron formerly Fox’s chief political correspondent told CNN.

The effects of anti-vaccine rhetoric could be severe. At least 99% of people in the US who died from coronavirus in the last six months were not vaccinated the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said.

While vaccine skepticism might win those ratings and revenue it is surely a law of diminishing returns. The median age of a Fox News viewer was 65 years old in 2017 suggesting many of those viewers are in the highest risk category.

Cameron said: “This is literally the metaphor of the lemmings running to their own slaughter. People who are listening to that sort of stuff instead of the science that goes way way back.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3huZXdzLmNvbS9tZWRpYS90aGUtd29rZS1tb2ItaXMtZXZlcnl3aGVyZS1oZXJlcy13aGVyZS1pdC1jYW1lLWZyb20tYW5kLXZpY3Rvci1kYXZpcy1oYW5zb25zLXNvbHV0aW9uLWZvci1zdG9wcGluZy1pdNIBhwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3huZXdzLmNvbS9tZWRpYS90aGUtd29rZS1tb2ItaXMtZXZlcnl3aGVyZS1oZXJlcy13aGVyZS1pdC1jYW1lLWZyb20tYW5kLXZpY3Rvci1kYXZpcy1oYW5zb25zLXNvbHV0aW9uLWZvci1zdG9wcGluZy1pdC5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The woke mob is everywhere: Here's where it came from and how one critic believes it can be stopped,"Wokeness has infiltrated every industry from the military to media to philanthropy. It has succeeded in spite of a lack of public support. But according to Hoover Institution senior fellow Victor Davis Hanson there is a way to stop it.

The word was first printed in a 1962 New York Times essay and traditionally has meant ""conscious"" and ""aware."" The Oxford Dictionary notes that the term originally meant well-informed or up-to-date but now chiefly means ""alert to racial or social discrimination and injustice.""

Hanson told Fox News that wokeness as we think of it today has its roots in decades of critical theory coming from universities.

Today it's intertwined with cancel culture critical race theory and progressive activism – and it’s everywhere you look.

WHAT DOES ‘WOKE’ MEAN?

The U.S. military has offered personal development classes focused on diversity equity and inclusion and Gen. Mark Milley chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff defended the teaching of critical race theory and other woke curriculum in military academies before the House Armed Services Committee.

The media has similarly come under fire for their activism with New York Times Magazine reporter Nikole Hannah-Jones declaring that ""all journalism is activism"" and CBS News reporter Kate Smith leaving the network and immediately declaring her advocacy for abortion rights.

School districts have faced public outcry over their teaching of critical race theory leading many states to go so far as to ban the curriculum.

Even generosity is not immune. Naomi Schaefer Riley noted in an opinion in the Wall Street Journal that ""nonprofits big and small have shifted their missions toward combatting ""inequity"" and ""systematic racism"" and according to Elise Westhoff president of the Philanthropy Roundtable ""donors have faced intimidation and threats of violence simply for supporting causes they believe in.""

WHAT IS CRITICAL RACE THEORY?

Hanson said the push toward wokeness picked up speed during the Obama administration when there was a ""separation of race from class"" and a movement to lump all non-White ethnicities into one homogenous identity called ""diversity.""

But it wasn’t until the last 18 months that wokeness reached a fever pitch.

""I think the perfect storm of COVID fears locking down two-thirds of the population for 15 months the self-induced recession the Trump derangement syndrome the George Floyd death the 120 days of riots the inactivity and inability to get people to meet one another the crazy election all of that was the spark or the fuse that lit the preexisting problems"" Hanson said.

For opponents of the societal push toward wokeness Hanson said not all hope is lost – the majority of American’s don’t support it either.

""Whatever aspect that we look at in wokeness whether it’s gender or race or immigration transgenderism it doesn’t have public support"" Hanson said.

Sixty-eight percent of American adults disapprove of the current administration’s handling of the southern border where an open door policy has led to a massive influx of illegal immigrants into the country according to Pew Research.

A Fox News poll further showed that despite a raging debate in many communities over critical race theory being taught in school nearly half of voters say they have never heard of it and only a quarter of Americans are in favor of teaching it to U.S. students.

Another Pew Research study showed 73% of Americans say college admissions should not be based on race.

One thing is clear about the trend that has dominated much of academia media and corporate America: it does not stem from overwhelming grassroots support.

VICTOR DAVIS HANSON: LEFT'S ‘VAGUE’ CLAIMS THAT AMERICA IS INHERENTLY RACIST ‘ADJUDICATED’ BY ‘METRICS’

Hanson said that is because proponents of woke ideology are now in positions of leadership.

""Unlike the '60s revolution which were protesting outside the corporation or outside the New York Times or outside Hollywood these people are inside"" said Hanson. ""They’ve taken over. So they run Hollywood they run the NBA they run the Major League Baseball they run the NFL they run Wall Street they run Silicon Valley they run the universities they run the media.""

""They infiltrated these institutions and took them over"" he continued. ""So that’s what explains why an agenda that has very little popular support continues to thrive.""

Mainstream media Hanson noted has fully bought into this ideology and can’t be counted on to report on it fairly.

Outlets like the New York Times and the Washington Post are now ""fused with the woke mob"" he said.

NEW YORK TIMES REPORTER NIKOLE HANNAH-JONES SAYS ‘ALL JOURNALISM IS ACTIVISM’

""They pick left-wing reporters so you can’t count on the media to stop the wokeness …or to report on its setbacks. They won’t do it.""

The left has succeeded in pushing this ideology into every facet of American life because they are organized he continued and opponents need to learn to fight fire with fire.

""[Republicans] are very polite they don’t cancel people out they don’t boycott they don’t get angry and noisy. And I think that has to end"" Hanson said.

The people who oppose woke ideology are ""half the country"" he continued. But they aren’t ""organized like the left is.""

""So I think they have to use the same methodology to fight back otherwise they’re going to be steamrolled by a minority that doesn’t have popular support that’s very much better organized and funded.""

Hanson said he can already see the public backlash against wokeism – the most notable examples being school board protests and Eric Adams a pro-law enforcement candidate winning the Democratic mayoral primary in New York.

But on a larger scale he said it will take a ""charismatic effective candidate who doesn’t polarize people and says ‘Look we’re not going to throw away the traditions of the United States because of a bad year or a bankrupt theory.'""

""I think the Republicans are going to have a big midterm election"" Hanson predicted. ""That’s what destroyed the Obama administration was the Tea Party pickup of 63 seats in 2010.""

""So I think it can be stopped because there’s no public support for it.""

But which airline ranked the best from April 2020 to March 2021?

According to The Points Guy’s Best Airlines analysis Delta Air Lines yet again keeps the top spot for best overall experience for flyers for the third year in a row.

AIRLINES ARE REBOUNDING EVEN AS PRICES SURGE: ADOBE

""Once again Delta Air Lines rose to the top of TPG’s Best Airlines analysis"" says Nick Ewen Senior Editor at The Points Guy. ""The data showed that the carrier offers consistent high-quality performance — from its reliability to the in-flight experience to its SkyMiles loyalty program. As the travel industry continues to bounce back from the coronavirus pandemic Delta is well-positioned to capitalize on the rebound.""

Following Delta was Southwest Airlines which came in second place. Allegiant Air on the other hand ranked as the worst airline.

Delta didn’t necessarily stand out in any single category but its consistency across all objectives is what allowed it to keep the top spot versus the other airlines.

The carrier ranked number one in both reliability and travel experience which are two key indicators in judging airline quality. Its frequent flyer program also held good standing ranking second place overall.

Customer service was also included where Delta was part of a four-way tie for runner-up with fewer than 10 complaints per 100000 passengers.

Additionally Delta tied for the top spot for lounge access with Alaska Airlines and tied with Allegiant and Hawaiian for zero involuntary bumps during the 12th-month period.

Southwest Airlines which came in second place overall ranked number one in customer service with an average of just over three complaints per 100000 passengers. It also took the top spot in baggage and change fees which were about .31 cents per passenger and award availability where it offered the most availability at the best value compared to the other airlines’ programs. The area it lacked was lounges.

Allegiant which stood at last place ranked poorly in terms of timeliness cancellations and its no-frills experience which included no Wi-Fi entertainment or outlets. The low-cost carrier also requires its passengers to be co-branded credit card holders in order to earn miles which lead them to score near zero in loyalty.

Carlson is known as a controversial figure in mainstream media.

Yesterday Carlson was spotted in Livingston Montana at Dan Bailey's Outdoor Company stocking up on gear for a fly fishing trip. While in the store Carlson was confronted by a local fly fishing guide Dan Bailey. This particular Dan Bailey in a bizarre turn of fate has no relationship to the gear shop he happened to be in when he encountered the Fox News host.

Warning: NSFW content in the video caption below.

Bailey didn't hold back when telling Carlson how he felt about him. In a video posted on Instagram Friday Bailey can be seen telling Carlson:

You are the worst human being known to mankind. I want you to know that.

The video has been viewed nearly 15000 times since it was posted Friday.

It’s not every day you get to tell someone they are the worst person in the world and really mean it! What an [expletive]! This man has killed more people with vaccine misinformation he has supported extreme racism he is a fascist and does more to rip this country apart than anyone that calls themselves an American.

Tucker Carlson has hosted the nightly political talk show Tucker Carlson Tonight on Fox News since 2016.

In a strange turn of fate Dan Bailey's Outdoor Company in Livingston has had to respond on the home page of its website offering the following explanation only hours after the incident occurred.

On July 23rd a well-known television personality Tucker Carlson was affronted while shopping at Dan Bailey's Outdoor Company. Coincidentally the person engaging Mr. Carlson was a local resident named Dan Bailey. This person has no affiliation with our business other than he shares the same name as our founder who passed away in 1982. To be clear we treat every customer equally and respectfully. Our staff was professional and cordial to Mr. Carlson as we are with all of our customers.

In response to being called the worst human being known to mankind Tucker Carlson can be seen in the video saying ""I appreciate that.""

American TV Channels - TV Industry: Statistics & Facts American TV channels produce and broadcast shows that are watched all around the world. Even nowadays where internet streaming services are gaining more and more subscribers and are in the process of slowly replacing television the biggest American TV networks still easily generate viewership in the millions every single day. TV is one of the most popular mediums in the United States reaching around 90 percent of adults per week. Audiences are able to choose from a plethora of programs with latest figures suggesting there are over 1700 TV stations in total. While adults are still spending a lot of time watching TV the number of hours per day has decreased from 4.2 in 2014 to around 3.35 as of 2018. Young adults seem to spend significantly less time watching television than their older counterparts as alternative forms of entertainment have begun to greatly increase in popularity. Consumers in the U.S. have been particularly quick to adopt new viewing technologies but nevertheless the number of TV households in the United States has continually increased over the last five years. Some of the most popular programs overall include Netflix originals like Stranger Things and Orange Is The New Black alongside traditional cable tv programs such as Spongebob Squarepants and the Daily Show.

Leading ad supported broadcast and cable networks in the United States by average number of viewers (in millions)

One of the industry’s major sources of income is advertising a revenue stream which is expected to remain relatively stable over the next few years with annual totals of over 70 billion U.S. dollars.

The share of this advertising that is attributed to online TV still accounts for less than ten percent of total advertising revenues but as the popularity of online offerings continues to grow this share is expected to increase.

Companies like Procter & Gamble AT&T and Berkshire Hathaway spend hundreds of millions of dollars each year on cable TV advertisement and the country’s most popular programs charge hundreds of thousands of dollars for each 30-second advertisement spot.

THE 50 TOP-RATED NETWORKS OF 2020 (BY ADULTS 18-49)"
FOX,Fox Corporation,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9tZWRpYS8yMDIxL2p1bC8yMy9mb3gtbmV3cy1jb3ZpZC12YWNjaW5hdGlvbi10dWNrZXItY2FybHNvbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fox News backs Covid vaccination – a pity no one told Tucker Carlson,"When Fox News launched a public service announcement urging people to get the Covid-19 vaccine this week it was hailed in some quarters as a virtuous move. What the network might not have expected was for the message to be almost immediately undermined by the network’s biggest star Tucker Carlson.

It looked like an onscreen real-time battle between Fox News and Carlson who has previously challenged the safety and questioned the effectiveness of the coronavirus vaccine that pointed to wider mixed messaging at the network over the issue of vaccination.

It was also a conflict that played out as the more contagious Delta variant of Covid-19 is spreading rapidly through areas of America where unvaccinated people are concentrated which are often Republican-supporting – and Fox-watching – states.

Since vaccines became commonly available in the US key opinion hosts on the rightwing news channel have repeatedly cast doubt on vaccination.

Laura Ingraham has proved to be a vaccine skeptic questioning the vaccine’s efficacy this week while in a two-week period from 28 June to 11 July Fox News personalities and guests ​​made a total of 216 claims undermining or downplaying vaccines in segments about coronavirus immunization according to Media Matters.

There has been a shift in some of Fox News’ coverage in the past week however. First Sean Hannity on Monday told his viewers to “please take Covid seriously – I can’t say it enough.”

Hannity added: “I believe in the science of vaccination.”

Hannity had previously made a similar comment – although it was also qualified with an exhortation to “talk to your doctor” – but this one came during a week in which Fox News launched its new public service announcement headlined on Fox News’ website as: “‘We’re in this together’: Fox News hosts urge Americans to get the vaccine” on Wednesday.

“America we’re in this together” Steve Doocy one of the co-hosts of the Fox & Friends morning show duly tells the viewer. We then see the daytime host Harris Faulkner who adds: “And if you can get the vaccine.” The video directs its viewers to a CDC link on the Fox News website where they can search for vaccination sites near them.

That was all well and good except Carlson Fox News’ most-watched host popped up an hour after the PSA aired to evacuate all over the sentiment.

Carlson who has been doing good business with far-right conservatives through his repeated questioning of the vaccine seemingly used CNN which has also encouraged its viewers to get vaccinated as a proxy for Fox News in an indignant monologue.

“As a channel CNN shouldn’t have a position on whether you should take medicine or not because it’s a news channel it’s not a health agency” Carlson said.

He later added: “Why is a news channel doing this? Any news channel. A lot of them are.”

The hoo-ha came a couple of days after Ingraham who hosts a show called The Ingraham Angle asked her viewers: “What about the efficacy of the vaccine itself among adults?” Ingraham pointed out that five vaccinated Texas Democrats had tested positive for coronavirus.

“We have to know more about that” Ingraham said.

The mixed messaging was the latest clash of thinking within Fox News over vaccines.

Carlson has howled on his show that the idea of vaccine passports is the medical equivalent of “Jim Crow” laws but against the dystopian picture of huddled masses presenting barcodes to emotionless big state bureaucrats is the reality that Fox has already implemented its own version of a vaccine passport among its staff.

An email sent to Fox Corporation staff including Fox News employees at the end of June said the company had “developed a secure voluntary way for employees to self-attest their vaccination status” according to CNN.

Staff are encouraged to report the dates they received the vaccine and their vaccine status. If they could prove to Fox that they were fully vaccinated they are eligible for the “Fox Clear Pass”. With the Fox Clear Pass staff are able to bypass an otherwise obligatory daily health screening CNN reported.

A Fox News spokeswoman pointed to examples of some of its hosts and journalists expressing support for vaccines and to a Fox News PSA from 2 February that showed Faulkner telling viewers “if you can get the vaccine”.

There are caveats however to at least some Fox News hosts’ apparent enthusiasm for the vaccine. After Hannity was praised by non-rightwing media for his seemingly pro-vaccine stance he angrily told viewers on Thursday: “I never told anyone to get a vaccine.”

And even Hannity’s – brief – encouragement of the vaccine was couched with him telling people they should speak to their doctor before getting it a caveat that seemed like a sop to vaccine skeptics. In the US where the majority of people have to pay to see a doctor consulting a medical professional can be a serious obstacle.

The questioning of vaccines by some Fox News hosts and other rightwing networks “[is] about ratings and ratings ultimately become revenue and that’s the name of the game” Carl Cameron formerly Fox’s chief political correspondent told CNN.

The effects of anti-vaccine rhetoric could be severe. At least 99% of people in the US who died from coronavirus in the last six months were not vaccinated the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said.

While vaccine skepticism might win those ratings and revenue it is surely a law of diminishing returns. The median age of a Fox News viewer was 65 years old in 2017 suggesting many of those viewers are in the highest risk category.

Cameron said: “This is literally the metaphor of the lemmings running to their own slaughter. People who are listening to that sort of stuff instead of the science that goes way way back.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3huZXdzLmNvbS9tZWRpYS90aGUtd29rZS1tb2ItaXMtZXZlcnl3aGVyZS1oZXJlcy13aGVyZS1pdC1jYW1lLWZyb20tYW5kLXZpY3Rvci1kYXZpcy1oYW5zb25zLXNvbHV0aW9uLWZvci1zdG9wcGluZy1pdNIBhwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3huZXdzLmNvbS9tZWRpYS90aGUtd29rZS1tb2ItaXMtZXZlcnl3aGVyZS1oZXJlcy13aGVyZS1pdC1jYW1lLWZyb20tYW5kLXZpY3Rvci1kYXZpcy1oYW5zb25zLXNvbHV0aW9uLWZvci1zdG9wcGluZy1pdC5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The woke mob is everywhere: Here's where it came from and how one critic believes it can be stopped,"Wokeness has infiltrated every industry from the military to media to philanthropy. It has succeeded in spite of a lack of public support. But according to Hoover Institution senior fellow Victor Davis Hanson there is a way to stop it.

The word was first printed in a 1962 New York Times essay and traditionally has meant ""conscious"" and ""aware."" The Oxford Dictionary notes that the term originally meant well-informed or up-to-date but now chiefly means ""alert to racial or social discrimination and injustice.""

Hanson told Fox News that wokeness as we think of it today has its roots in decades of critical theory coming from universities.

Today it's intertwined with cancel culture critical race theory and progressive activism – and it’s everywhere you look.

WHAT DOES ‘WOKE’ MEAN?

The U.S. military has offered personal development classes focused on diversity equity and inclusion and Gen. Mark Milley chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff defended the teaching of critical race theory and other woke curriculum in military academies before the House Armed Services Committee.

The media has similarly come under fire for their activism with New York Times Magazine reporter Nikole Hannah-Jones declaring that ""all journalism is activism"" and CBS News reporter Kate Smith leaving the network and immediately declaring her advocacy for abortion rights.

School districts have faced public outcry over their teaching of critical race theory leading many states to go so far as to ban the curriculum.

Even generosity is not immune. Naomi Schaefer Riley noted in an opinion in the Wall Street Journal that ""nonprofits big and small have shifted their missions toward combatting ""inequity"" and ""systematic racism"" and according to Elise Westhoff president of the Philanthropy Roundtable ""donors have faced intimidation and threats of violence simply for supporting causes they believe in.""

WHAT IS CRITICAL RACE THEORY?

Hanson said the push toward wokeness picked up speed during the Obama administration when there was a ""separation of race from class"" and a movement to lump all non-White ethnicities into one homogenous identity called ""diversity.""

But it wasn’t until the last 18 months that wokeness reached a fever pitch.

""I think the perfect storm of COVID fears locking down two-thirds of the population for 15 months the self-induced recession the Trump derangement syndrome the George Floyd death the 120 days of riots the inactivity and inability to get people to meet one another the crazy election all of that was the spark or the fuse that lit the preexisting problems"" Hanson said.

For opponents of the societal push toward wokeness Hanson said not all hope is lost – the majority of American’s don’t support it either.

""Whatever aspect that we look at in wokeness whether it’s gender or race or immigration transgenderism it doesn’t have public support"" Hanson said.

Sixty-eight percent of American adults disapprove of the current administration’s handling of the southern border where an open door policy has led to a massive influx of illegal immigrants into the country according to Pew Research.

A Fox News poll further showed that despite a raging debate in many communities over critical race theory being taught in school nearly half of voters say they have never heard of it and only a quarter of Americans are in favor of teaching it to U.S. students.

Another Pew Research study showed 73% of Americans say college admissions should not be based on race.

One thing is clear about the trend that has dominated much of academia media and corporate America: it does not stem from overwhelming grassroots support.

VICTOR DAVIS HANSON: LEFT'S ‘VAGUE’ CLAIMS THAT AMERICA IS INHERENTLY RACIST ‘ADJUDICATED’ BY ‘METRICS’

Hanson said that is because proponents of woke ideology are now in positions of leadership.

""Unlike the '60s revolution which were protesting outside the corporation or outside the New York Times or outside Hollywood these people are inside"" said Hanson. ""They’ve taken over. So they run Hollywood they run the NBA they run the Major League Baseball they run the NFL they run Wall Street they run Silicon Valley they run the universities they run the media.""

""They infiltrated these institutions and took them over"" he continued. ""So that’s what explains why an agenda that has very little popular support continues to thrive.""

Mainstream media Hanson noted has fully bought into this ideology and can’t be counted on to report on it fairly.

Outlets like the New York Times and the Washington Post are now ""fused with the woke mob"" he said.

NEW YORK TIMES REPORTER NIKOLE HANNAH-JONES SAYS ‘ALL JOURNALISM IS ACTIVISM’

""They pick left-wing reporters so you can’t count on the media to stop the wokeness …or to report on its setbacks. They won’t do it.""

The left has succeeded in pushing this ideology into every facet of American life because they are organized he continued and opponents need to learn to fight fire with fire.

""[Republicans] are very polite they don’t cancel people out they don’t boycott they don’t get angry and noisy. And I think that has to end"" Hanson said.

The people who oppose woke ideology are ""half the country"" he continued. But they aren’t ""organized like the left is.""

""So I think they have to use the same methodology to fight back otherwise they’re going to be steamrolled by a minority that doesn’t have popular support that’s very much better organized and funded.""

Hanson said he can already see the public backlash against wokeism – the most notable examples being school board protests and Eric Adams a pro-law enforcement candidate winning the Democratic mayoral primary in New York.

But on a larger scale he said it will take a ""charismatic effective candidate who doesn’t polarize people and says ‘Look we’re not going to throw away the traditions of the United States because of a bad year or a bankrupt theory.'""

""I think the Republicans are going to have a big midterm election"" Hanson predicted. ""That’s what destroyed the Obama administration was the Tea Party pickup of 63 seats in 2010.""

""So I think it can be stopped because there’s no public support for it.""

But which airline ranked the best from April 2020 to March 2021?

According to The Points Guy’s Best Airlines analysis Delta Air Lines yet again keeps the top spot for best overall experience for flyers for the third year in a row.

AIRLINES ARE REBOUNDING EVEN AS PRICES SURGE: ADOBE

""Once again Delta Air Lines rose to the top of TPG’s Best Airlines analysis"" says Nick Ewen Senior Editor at The Points Guy. ""The data showed that the carrier offers consistent high-quality performance — from its reliability to the in-flight experience to its SkyMiles loyalty program. As the travel industry continues to bounce back from the coronavirus pandemic Delta is well-positioned to capitalize on the rebound.""

Following Delta was Southwest Airlines which came in second place. Allegiant Air on the other hand ranked as the worst airline.

Delta didn’t necessarily stand out in any single category but its consistency across all objectives is what allowed it to keep the top spot versus the other airlines.

The carrier ranked number one in both reliability and travel experience which are two key indicators in judging airline quality. Its frequent flyer program also held good standing ranking second place overall.

Customer service was also included where Delta was part of a four-way tie for runner-up with fewer than 10 complaints per 100000 passengers.

Additionally Delta tied for the top spot for lounge access with Alaska Airlines and tied with Allegiant and Hawaiian for zero involuntary bumps during the 12th-month period.

Southwest Airlines which came in second place overall ranked number one in customer service with an average of just over three complaints per 100000 passengers. It also took the top spot in baggage and change fees which were about .31 cents per passenger and award availability where it offered the most availability at the best value compared to the other airlines’ programs.

Allegiant which stood at last place ranked poorly in terms of timeliness cancellations and its no-frills experience which included no Wi-Fi entertainment or outlets.

Carlson is known as a controversial figure in mainstream media.

Yesterday Carlson was spotted in Livingston Montana at Dan Bailey's Outdoor Company stocking up on gear for a fly fishing trip. While in the store Carlson was confronted by a local fly fishing guide Dan Bailey. This particular Dan Bailey in a bizarre turn of fate has no relationship to the gear shop he happened to be in when he encountered the Fox News host.

Warning: NSFW content in the video caption below.

Bailey didn't hold back when telling Carlson how he felt about him. In a video posted on Instagram Friday Bailey can be seen telling Carlson:

You are the worst human being known to mankind. I want you to know that.

The video has been viewed nearly 15000 times since it was posted Friday.

It’s not every day you get to tell someone they are the worst person in the world and really mean it! What an [expletive]! This man has killed more people with vaccine misinformation he has supported extreme racism he is a fascist and does more to rip this country apart than anyone that calls themselves an American.

Tucker Carlson has hosted the nightly political talk show Tucker Carlson Tonight on Fox News since 2016.

In a strange turn of fate Dan Bailey's Outdoor Company in Livingston has had to respond on the home page of its website offering the following explanation only hours after the incident occurred.

On July 23rd a well-known television personality Tucker Carlson was affronted while shopping at Dan Bailey's Outdoor Company. Coincidentally the person engaging Mr. Carlson was a local resident named Dan Bailey. This person has no affiliation with our business other than he shares the same name as our founder who passed away in 1982. To be clear we treat every customer equally and respectfully. Our staff was professional and cordial to Mr. Carlson as we are with all of our customers.

In response to being called the worst human being known to mankind Tucker Carlson can be seen in the video saying ""I appreciate that.""

American TV Channels - TV Industry: Statistics & Facts American TV channels produce and broadcast shows that are watched all around the world. Even nowadays where internet streaming services are gaining more and more subscribers and are in the process of slowly replacing television the biggest American TV networks still easily generate viewership in the millions every single day. TV is one of the most popular mediums in the United States reaching around 90 percent of adults per week. Audiences are able to choose from a plethora of programs with latest figures suggesting there are over 1700 TV stations in total. While adults are still spending a lot of time watching TV the number of hours per day has decreased from 4.2 in 2014 to around 3.35 as of 2018. Young adults seem to spend significantly less time watching television than their older counterparts as alternative forms of entertainment have begun to greatly increase in popularity. Consumers in the U.S. have been particularly quick to adopt new viewing technologies but nevertheless the number of TV households in the United States has continually increased over the last five years. Some of the most popular programs overall include Netflix originals like Stranger Things and Orange Is The New Black alongside traditional cable tv programs such as Spongebob Squarepants and the Daily Show.

Leading ad supported broadcast and cable networks in the United States by average number of viewers (in millions)

One of the industry’s major sources of income is advertising a revenue stream which is expected to remain relatively stable over the next few years with annual totals of over 70 billion U.S. dollars.

The share of this advertising that is attributed to online TV still accounts for less than ten percent of total advertising revenues but as the popularity of online offerings continues to grow this share is expected to increase.

Companies like Procter & Gamble AT&T and Berkshire Hathaway spend hundreds of millions of dollars each year on cable TV advertisement and the country’s most popular programs charge hundreds of thousands of dollars for each 30-second advertisement spot.

Hyderabad follows Amaravati with the issue of Rs 495 crore worth municipal bonds.Visakhapatnam the port city which AP CM Jagan Mohan Reddy has turned into an executive capital and wanted to shift from Amaravati could pool Rs 80 crore worth funds from the bonds.The Union government revealed this to a member’s query in the Lok Sabha. The government said Rs 3840 crore had been raised through municipal bonds by 10 cities.Other cities which raised the bonds include Ahmedabad Surat Pune and Lucknow at Rs 200 crore each Bhopal Rs 175 crore and Ghaziabad Rs 150 crore. The then TDP government proposed Amaravati as the ‘only capital’ to be developed at a cost of Rs 1 lakh crore over 20 years under public-private partnership mode.With funds drying up then government issued ‘Amaravati bonds’ in August 2018. The Capital Region Development Authority (CRDA) which has since been scrapped managed to get investors like Franklin Templeton Asset Management (India) Private Ltd and Aditya Birla Sun Life Assessment Management Company Ltd for the bond scheme.The CRDA is believed to have spent Rs 900 crore on infrastructure in Amaravati from the bonds raised. C Kutumba Rao former AP Planning Board vice-chairman and who worked closely with the CRDA for raising the bonds said: “We approached the right players and succeeded in raising the bonds. Amaravati even got Rs 36 crore as an incentive from the Centre then.”These bonds had a 10-year tenure with a five-year moratorium on the principal amount. After it elicited a good response in the market the CRDA had even planned to go for ‘masala’ and ‘green’ bonds on the global platforms but the plan did not materialise.As part of an urban infrastructure development initiative the Centre encourages the urban local bodies to raise municipal bonds while cities get between Rs 13 crore and Rs 26 crore as an incentive for pooling funds under the municipal bonds.However experts said funds raised through these bonds are often diverted though they are to be spent only on infrastructure development. “Despite clear guidelines some governments quietly divert the funds for other purposes including payment of salaries for their government employees. The real purpose of raising the bonds will be served only when the needs of a city are taken care of” A Nakula Reddy director of Andhra Mahila Sabha College and former economics professor Osmania University  said.He recalled that Amaravati bonds offered the highest premium (interest) rate for the buyers.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzcy1zdGFuZGFyZC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9tYXJrZXRzL25qLWluZGlhLXNiaS10b29rLWxpb24tcy1zaGFyZS1vZi1tdXR1YWwtZnVuZC1jb21taXNzaW9ucy1pbi1meTIxLTEyMTA3MjQwMDA0Ml8xLmh0bWzSAYsBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3Mtc3RhbmRhcmQuY29tL2FtcC9hcnRpY2xlL21hcmtldHMvbmotaW5kaWEtc2JpLXRvb2stbGlvbi1zLXNoYXJlLW9mLW11dHVhbC1mdW5kLWNvbW1pc3Npb25zLWluLWZ5MjEtMTIxMDcyNDAwMDQyXzEuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NJ India SBI took lion's share of mutual fund commissions in FY21,"Mutual fund (MF) distributors received Rs 6617 crore in commissions from the asset management industry in financial year 2020-21 (FY21) 7.6 per cent up compared to the preceding year.

The promise of fitness trackers naturally is quantizing and optimizing fitness. Some activity is always better than no activity but getting the best results means figuring out how many calories and nutrients you’re consuming and learning how to perform harder better and faster. Before picking up a device from Fitbit Samsung or Polar it’s important to be aware that all of the major trackers are biased towards cardio workouts.

We should note that in this case “bias” doesn’t imply that companies are being unfair or even necessarily intentional. Rather trackers (and their Android and iPhone apps) are optimized for cardio first and foremost. Modes for activities like yoga and strength training are commonplace — but the value of fitness trackers is diminished for them.

For our purposes we’re further going to define cardio as workouts like running walking or cycling and to a lesser extent things like ellipticals rowing machines or battle ropes. While most workouts will make your heart beat faster cardio makes that the primary goal.

Fitness tracker issue #1: Motion sensors

Jimmy Westenberg / Android Authority

Barring a few chest straps and other exceptions most trackers are equipped with gyroscopes. Comparing live data against expected patterns makes it possible to track repetitive movements such as running and walking. A Fitbit for example calculates a wearer’s “steps” based on their bobbing motion.

Step counts can be a helpful metric for the average person. However they’re easy to fake and even when someone’s completely honest trackers will often miscount. Indeed companies are already beginning to move on to different metrics such as active minutes. Serious runners don’t pay attention to their steps at all — they’re more concerned about pace efficiency heart rate and oxygen levels.

If gyroscopes are unreliable for something as simple as running that makes them even less suited to complex activities like dancing or ones with little wrist movement such as pull-ups. Even barbell squats and bench presses are hard to track consistently since lifters use different grips and ranges. A few companies do make an effort in that regard — Garmin for instance lets people track sets and reps — but that data usually needs to be corrected later robbing it of any convenience. It’s often easier to jot things down on paper.

Issue #2: Heart rate doesn’t tell you everything

Dhruv Bhutani / Android Authority

The one sensor type with universal value is heart rate. Combined with details like age and weight a properly worn optical or EKG sensor can give a sense of how well you’re performing and a ballpark figure for calorie burn. In fact many people engage in something called zone training in which they try to keep their heart within a target range. Fitbit Garmin and Polar watches in particular cater to the zone concept.

Many activities don’t lend themselves to zone training though and wrist-based heart rate sensors are least accurate when intensity dips and spikes — launching into a 300-pound deadlift after a 60-second rest for example. It’s worth noting some higher-end wrist-based HR sensors can keep up with more accurate chest straps but it’s a rare case.

Heart rate also fails to fully gauge performance in many cases. Weightlifters are most concerned about power and lift totals while activities like yoga and pilates are as much about mobility and endurance as anything. See also: The best heart rate monitors and watches

It can’t be stressed enough that for calories even the best HR sensors — like the EKG units on chest straps generally the most accurate consumer option — can only deliver a rough estimate. Many factors determine real-world calorie burn so trackers can often be hundreds of calories off making all the difference if someone is trying to gain weight or lose it. An estimate can be useful but only as a starting point for personal tweaks and that’s particularly true for people operating outside of the cardio sphere.

Issue #3: The fickle nature of public demand

Very timid attempt at Kettlebell juggling!

All device makers thrive or die based on consumer demand. Given finite resources then it makes sense then to aim products at the biggest demographics. The result with fitness trackers is that they’re marketed to cardio fans — there are more people running walking and cycling than there are pumping iron. This in turn is because people are more often concerned about weight loss or general heart health than things like strength or flexibility.

All device makers thrive or die based on consumer demand.

The effect of this can be seen not just in hardware specs but in apps like Apple Fitness and Google Fit which prioritize cardio activities. The former encourages people to close their daily Move rings while Fit awards users with “Heart Points.” Some apps go a step further and assume that your goal must be weight loss — Polar Flow for example will regularly chastise you if your weight increases. It doesn’t matter if those extra 10 pounds are mostly muscle.

Is anyone trying to work around the cardio bias?

Jimmy Westenberg / Android Authority

Beyond Garmin perhaps the best effort to tackle the situation comes from Coros. The latter outfit’s fitness watches let people build structured strength workouts via a mobile app even targeting individual muscle groups through a range of selectable exercises. This actually addresses a more important concern than rep counting — making sure training hits every muscle often enough to trigger growth. Coros devices start at $200 for the Pace 2 though the cheapest model with a touchscreen (by no means required) is the $500 Apex Pro. Read: The best running watches you can buy from Garmin Polar Coros and more

There have been some extremely niche efforts such as the $495 Flex barbell sensor. One of the earliest wrist-based strength trackers came from Austin’s Atlas Wearables but its products never hit the mainstream as a solo company. That could be about to change — Atlas was bought by Peloton in March 2021 and Bloomberg reports that the company is developing an armband that will pair with Peloton’s cycles and treadmills. While the focus should obviously be cardio Peloton integrates some strength work and might use Atlas’ algorithms.

Recommended trackers for non-cardio workouts

Coros’ Pace 2 and Apex Pro are logical choices for people focused on strength who insist on going the watch route. If you don’t need a new watch and/or aren’t interested in strength it may actually be simpler (for the fitness-first crowd) to choose a chest strap or armband. The gold standard for chest straps is the Polar H10 a model that supports both Bluetooth and ANT+ connections and can cache a single session’s data so you don’t have to have your phone nearby. Because it’s a few years old it can periodically be found below its $90 price tag.

Optical armbands are less accurate than chest straps but typically more comfortable and may be a happy medium for people who want to keep their wrists free. Polar is again the leader in this area thanks to the $90 Verity Sense which can store up to 600 hours of data and even be clipped onto swimming goggles to track heart rate from your temple. A solid alternative is Scosche’s $90 Rhythm+ 2.0 which doesn’t have memory but does have a 24-hour rechargeable battery.

Realistically so long as there’s a decent HR sensor most people can get along with a standard wrist-based tracker or smartwatch — especially if non-fitness functions are the priority. It’s just a question of acknowledging and adjusting to biases which is something every fitness product demands at the moment. It may take a few more years before hardware and software can close the gap. Next: The best smartwatches you can buy

What are the Technological advances ?

The Denali is powered by GE Aviation’s new advanced Catalyst engine which has completed over 2300 hours of testing and prepping for a first flight on its Beechcraft King Air flying test bed. The Catalyst is a more environmentally friendly engine that burns less fuel than older turboprop technologies. The engine can also use sustainable aviation fuel which results in lower emissions.

The FADEC-equipped 1300 shaft horsepower (SHP)-rated turboprop engine eases pilot workload with its single-lever power and propeller control. The FADEC control of the engine provides trend monitoring which allows for on-condition maintenance with no mid-life Hot Section Inspection required.

The airplane is equipped with McCauley’s new 105-inch diameter composite 5-blade constant speed propeller which is full feathering with reversible pitch and ice protection. The propeller will undergo a series of certification tests and several are already underway.

The Denali cockpit features the Garmin G3000 intuitive avionics suite featuring high-resolution and touchscreen controllers. An integrated Garmin autothrottle is now a standard feature which interfaces with the Automatic Flight Control System (AFCS) and Flight Management System (FMS) to provide easy speed control throughout all regimes of flight from takeoff to touchdown.

Other G3000 features include a 10-inch weather radar Advanced Terrain Awareness Warning Systems (TAWS) and dual transponders with automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) capabilities which are compliant with the latest air traffic control requirements.

What do passengers get ?

The Beechcraft Denali’s flat floor cabin is designed to be the largest in its segment and offers the versatility to easily convert between passenger and cargo configurations. The Denali cabin features a standard seating configuration of six individual reclining seats and offers a nine-place high density seating option.

The aircraft boasts a digital pressurization system maintaining a 6000-foot cabin altitude at a service ceiling of 30000 feet. The Denali also offers passengers the convenience of adjusting the cabin temperature and airflow from a climate-control switch panel located on the cabin sidewall.

Passengers will also enjoy large cabin windows interior LED lighting a forward refreshment cabinet and an in-flight accessible baggage compartment. An optional externally serviceable belted lavatory with pocket door enclosure that is located in the rear of the cabin is also available.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ldXJhc2lhbnRpbWVzLmNvbS9ib2VpbmctdG8tdXBncmFkZS1pdHMtYXBhY2hlLWhlbGljb3B0ZXJzLXRvLXRoZS1tb3N0LWFkdmFuY2VkLWluZGlhbi12YXJpYW50LWluLWFzaWEtcGFjaWZpYy1yZWdpb24v0gGCAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cmFzaWFudGltZXMuY29tL2JvZWluZy10by11cGdyYWRlLWl0cy1hcGFjaGUtaGVsaWNvcHRlcnMtdG8tdGhlLW1vc3QtYWR2YW5jZWQtaW5kaWFuLXZhcmlhbnQtaW4tYXNpYS1wYWNpZmljLXJlZ2lvbi8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Boeing To Upgrade Its Apache Helicopters To The Most Advanced ‘Indian Variant’ In Asia-Pacific Region,"Boeing is eyeing to upgrade its multi-role Apache attack helicopters to the most advanced and lethal variant in the Asia-Pacific region. India is already using the latest variant of the Boeing chopper.

The countries operating Apache AH-64D variant are considering upgrading their choppers to the ‘E’ standard Randy Rotte the India-based head of Boeing Asia-Pacific was quoted as saying by Flight Global.

The Indian Air Force (IAF) uses the AH-64E the most advanced variant of the Apache attack helicopter. Among other features the ‘E’ variant has the capability to control unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) which could be a game-changer in future operations.

In July 2019 the US Army itself finalized a deal with Boeing to produce or remanufacture up to 600 US Army AH-64s to the ‘E’ standard the most advanced.

Rotte emphasized that the steady production line in place for the upgrading US Army’s Apache helicopters will aid other militaries who are considering upgrading their legacy AH-64Ds to 64E.

“You don’t want to wait until that production goes down to zero or close to zero [because] then you bear the weight and the burden of the cost of keeping that production line going” he said.

Rotte emphasized that the steady production line in place for the upgrading US Army’s Apache helicopters will aid other militaries who are considering upgrading their legacy AH-64Ds to 64E.

“You don’t want to wait until that production goes down to zero or close to zero [because] then you bear the weight and the burden of the cost of keeping that production line going” he said.

Rotte also noted how each country has their own configurations based on their requirements and unique situation and the upgrades depends on different use patterns and helicopter configurations around the region.

In the Asia-Pacific India already operates the most advanced AH-64E variant along with Indonesia South Korea and Taiwan. On the other hand countries like Japan and Singapore still operate the older AH-64D.

This year in January Australia joined the league of countries with the AH-64E variant after it signed a $3.5 billion deal for the helicopter and related equipment.

India’s Apache Deal

According to Boeing India is one of 17 nations to select the Apache and has the most advanced variant the AH-64E Apache that is also flown by the US and several other countries.

In 2015 India inked a deal with US aerospace giant Boeing for production training and support of 22 Apache Attack helicopters along with 15 CH-47F (I) Chinook heavy-lift helicopters.

The first batch containing eight helicopters arrived at Air Force Station Pathankot in September 2019.

Glimpses of AH-64E Apache Attack Helicopter induction ceremony held at Air Force Station Pathankot. pic.twitter.com/CDthKPFrKZ — Indian Air Force (@IAF_MCC) September 3 2019

The aero-structures for the AH-64 Apache helicopter for both US Army and international customers are being produced in India at Boeing’s joint venture with Tata Tata Boeing Aerospace Limited (TBAL).

Recently the Hyderabad facility completed the production of the 100th fuselage for the Apache helicopter.

India received the final batch of the helicopters at Air Force Station at Hindon in July 2020 amid the border standoff with China in eastern Ladakh. Several media reports suggest that the deadly rotorcraft has been deployed at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) for night sorties.

Earlier in February 2020 India and the US signed a contract for the acquisition of six Apaches for the Indian Army during US President Donald Trump’s visit to New Delhi. The choppers are expected to be delivered in 2023.

In March this year the US Army’s advanced attack helicopter was equipped with the lethal Spike NLOS (Non-Line Of Sight) missiles to increase the accuracy of the strikes and enhance the helicopter’s ability to strike moving targets as reported by Eurasian Times.

This has increased the speculation in military circles for a similar weapon integration with India’s Apache helicopters which could make the existing AH-64E variant more lethal.

The E-Variant

Boeing describes AH-64 as the world’s most advanced multi-role combat helicopter which serves as the backbone of the US Army attack helicopter fleet.

The original AH-64 was first flown in 1975 and since then it has served the US military missions in Panama the Persian Gulf Kosovo Afghanistan and Iraq.

The AH-64E Apache is designed and equipped with an open systems architecture including the latest communications navigation sensor and weapon systems. It has an improved Modernized Target Acquisition Designation System that provides day-night and all-weather target information as well as night vision navigation capability.

It is a versatile rotorcraft capable of conducting reconnaissance security peacekeeping operations and lethal attack across myriad environments without reconfiguration.

In the ‘E’ variant the Apache’s performance is improved via the more powerful GE Aviation T700-701D engines upgraded face gear transmission to accommodate more power new composite main rotor blades and an improved rotor drive system. Other upgrades include enhanced avionics advanced digital connectivity and a cognitive decision aiding system according to Boeing.

Boeing had reportedly also conceptualized an ‘F’ variant however the project was shelved after the US Army’s plan to build an attack version of the Future Vertical Lift (FVL) aircraft to replace the Apache by 2040.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cmFzaWFudGltZXMuY29tL2luZGlhcy01dGgtZ2VuLWFpcmNyYWZ0LWlhZi10by1tb2RlbC1pdHMtYW1jYS1vbi11cy1mLTM1cy1pbnN0ZWFkLW9mLWotMjAtb3Itc3UtNTctamV0cy1leHBlcnRzL9IBfmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cmFzaWFudGltZXMuY29tL2luZGlhcy01dGgtZ2VuLWFpcmNyYWZ0LWlhZi10by1tb2RlbC1pdHMtYW1jYS1vbi11cy1mLTM1cy1pbnN0ZWFkLW9mLWotMjAtb3Itc3UtNTctamV0cy1leHBlcnRzLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,India’s 5th-Gen Aircraft: IAF To Model Its AMCA On US’ F-35s Instead Of J-20 Or Su-57 Jets – Experts,"India is on course to develop its very own fifth-generation multirole fighter jet expected to enter service in the next decade. With this India will join the league of the US Russia and China which boast advanced jets such as F-35 Su-57 and J-20 respectively.

The Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA) program aims to build a homegrown fifth-generation fighter jet with “sixth-generation characteristics” intended to replace the aging fleet SEPECAT Jaguar Dassault Mirage 2000 and MiG-27.

The AMCA is eyeing a complementary role for the Indian Air Force’s (IAF) air superiority fighters to serve as a flexible force multiplier with versatile missions.

With the AMCA fighter India will join the elite club of the US Russia and China each of which has developed an indigenous fifth-generation aircraft.

The origins of India’s own fighter program dates back to 2018 when the country withdrew from the joint Russian-Indian Fifth Generation Fighter Aircraft (FGFA) program to manufacture a new fighter based on Russia’s Su-57 model.

However military experts suggest that the technical design and projected specifications of AMCA share many similarities with the US F-35 one of the most advanced jets in the world.

AMCA Program

The Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA) is a program to develop a fifth-generation fighter aircraft.

The Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA) under India’s Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) is responsible for designing the plane and state-run Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) is the primary contractor responsible for assembly and development of individual components like landing gear air-to-air refueling (AAR) probe and some parts of the composite structure.

It is a multi-role combat aircraft designed for air superiority ground attack bombing intercepting strike and other missions.

After initial approval in funding and design a computer-aided design (CAD) model of the aircraft was shown at the ‘Aero India’ show in 2019.

The proposed fifth-generation “stealth” aircraft will have all-weather capabilities and supercruise capability. It is also planned to have both manned and unmanned operational capability.

The indigenous jet will be equipped with advanced AESA radar supermaneuverability data fusion and advanced avionics. Reports suggest that the fighter program will be developed in a joint venture with a private company something that has not been done in India so far.

“We have to decide how we produce the jet after freezing (finalizing) its design. We want to bring in private Indian partners for the production” R Madhavan chairman-cum-Managing Director of the HAL told Indian daily The Tribune.

ADA is reportedly looking to fly the AMCA prototype by 2025 and commence production by 2026-28.

Other Fifth-Gen Jets

Although India kickstarted the process to build an indigenous fifth-generation jet as a fallout of the joint Russian program the AMCA has more similarities with Lockheed Martin’s F-35 jet than to Russia’s Su-57 jet or China’s J-20 jet with respect to its design.

AMCA has been designed as a role-flexible fighter capable of executing a wide range of missions depending on loadout according to National Interest.

The US China and Russia are the only three in the world to have fifth-generation jets in service. While the F-35 entered service in 2016 China became the second country in the world to induct its J-20 in 2017 followed by Russian Su-57 which was inducted into the air force in late 2020.

Russia’s Su-57 is a single-seat twin-engine multi-role aircraft with supercruise supermaneuverability and stealth capability.

China’s J-20 is also a single-seat twin-engine jet meant for “air defense systems penetration” and precision strike missions.

On the other hand Lockheed Martin’s F-35 has state-of-the-art stealth technology advanced radars electronic warfare systems and transformational capabilities that enable pilots to operate in any environment against any threat.

The F-35 is also capable of strategic attack and intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance missions making it much more versatile than the other jets.

AMCA is also projected to perform multiple missions from deep penetration to air superiority roles.

Indigenous Engine

Younis Dar a senior defense journalist with The Eurasian Times wrote a report on the procurement of engines by the Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA) for indigenous jets.

The ADA is eyeing the F414 GE jet engine to power the first two squadrons of AMCA fighters while the next two are expected to use the indigenous engine.

Scientists at the organization are faced with the daunting task of developing a completely new engine to suit the fifth-generation fighter with the capability to produce a thrust of 110-kilo newton (kN) the report said.

Earlier an indigenous engine ‘Kaveri’ was being developed by DRDO first mooted in 1989 when indigenous Tejas jet was on the drawing board. Despite 1880 hours of engine test in 2010 several technical problems and cost overruns raised questions on the efficiency of the program.

Decaying performance at high altitude combustion flicker and insufficient thrust are some of the problems plaguing the integration of an indigenous engine with an Indian-made fighter jet.

Recent reports suggest that India is all set to ink another major defense deal with the United States (US) to acquire fighter jet engines worth $700 million.

The Indian Air Force (IAF) will buy a total of 83 jet engines of the LCA Tejas Mk-1A version an indigenous fourth-generation fighter from US company General Electric (GE).

The GE F404 also known as GE 404 is a turbojet engine used in numerous military aircraft including McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet KAI T-50 Golden Eagle and Northrop F-20 Tigershark.

Every variant of the HAL Tejas including the latest Mark 1A has been powered by the F404. The AMCA along with indigenous LCA Tejas French Rafale and the Russian Sukhoi Su-30 will make the IAF a formidable force in the region.

Dar when interviewing defense officials analyzed that India would want to model its AMCA on the lines of the F-35 jet while dramatically cutting the costs.

Since India already rejected the Su-57 and capabilities of J-20 appear very uncertain New Delhi is ‘getting inspired’ by US technology (as most of avionics and engine is based on western and not on Russian tech).

Even with the Tejas fighter jet which will serve as the bae to AMCA the aircraft is 60 percent Indian by government estimates. Value of other foreign components includes the plane’s General Electric F404 jet engine and Israel Aerospace Industries’ radar and electronic warfare systems.

Dar concludes that there is a possible shift in the Indian military circles who are looking to move away from Russian technology given the lessons learned from the fallout of the FGFA project. Despite a robust defense partnership with Russia it seems that India’s first fifth-generation fighter jet will not really host any Russian technology and could be like the Indian F-35.",,,,,,
GEHC,GE HealthCare,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vYmJqLmh1L2J1c2luZXNzL3Blb3BsZS9pbnRlcnZpZXcvaGVhbHRoY2FyZS1yb2Fkc2hvdy1oaWdobGlnaHRzLWlubm92YXRpb24tc2NyZWVuaW5nLWF3YXJlbmVzc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Healthcare Roadshow Highlights Innovation Screening Awareness - BBJ,"GE Healthcare has launched a roadshow across Europe filled with innovations to raise awareness of the importance of timely medical screenings. The aim is to catch diseases early enough for proper treatment to start increasing the chances of survival especially in serious cases such as cancer.

The truck is equipped with the latest medical imaging innovations by GE Healthcare to which its Hungarian hub has contributed significantly. With the WHXR Roadshow 2021 touring 16 countries in 29 weeks the Budapest Business Journal talks to Endre Ascsillán vice president at GE Global CEE based in Hungary.

“We are proud that Hungary has been the first stop of this spectacular tour in the region. Medical professionals have had the opportunity to see the truck live first in Siófok later in Debrecen” Ascsillán says.

One of the consequences of the disruptions caused by the coronavirus are people whose health may be compromised not directly by the disease but by the lack of attention as health care institutions are overwhelmed. Regular and timely screening exams are crucial to diagnosing diseases early when the chances for a successful treatment are greatest.

“Delaying recommended cancer screenings may result in missed early-stage cancers that are not caught until they are already more advanced and potentially more difficult to treat. That impacts both the chances of recovery and the cost of the treatment” Ascsillán says.

With medical staff across Europe working flat out to prioritize coronavirus patients many tests have been missed or delayed potentially jeopardizing the health of people whose diseases may have gone unnoticed.

In women’s health for example breast cancer is the most common neoplasia (an abnormal and excessive growth). It affects approximately one out of nine women. Mammography screenings dropped significantly during the pandemic although an early diagnosis could be the most critical part of effective treatment decreasing the risk of dying considerably.

Machine Learning

“Our latest digital innovations in medical imaging enable patients to get the answers they need about their health as quickly as possible while our use of artificial intelligence (AI) brings the power of algorithms and machine learning to imaging” Ascsillán explains.

He adds that GE Healthcare’s digital teams in Hungary play a significant role in developing innovative diagnostic solutions for the firm’s global customers.

Beyond the difficulties the pandemic has created opportunities have also started growing. “In general we can say that COVID-19 has accelerated the pace of technological change that has never been so dynamic and pointed out several new directions for development. It has also revealed the shortcomings of healthcare systems how healthcare providers face challenges delivering high-quality care while managing greater capacity and workflow issues” the vice president says.

This has triggered demand for adaptable and digitalized healthcare systems that empower clinicians with next-generation tools.

“Building on our innovation capabilities available intelligent devices access to data analytics applications and services that are supported by the Edison platform GE enables healthcare professionals to make faster more informed decisions” the vice president says.

GE Healthcare’s data science team in Budapest and Szeged have recently developed two revolutionary AI algorithms for X-ray machines. The first which is FDA-approved is embedded on-device and helps radiologists prioritize live-threatening critical cases with a suspected collapsed lung.

The second which works with GE’s Critical Care Suite 2.0 helps clinicians assess Endotracheal Tube (ETT) placement for intubated patients (in the case of patients on a ventilator for example) including critical COVID-19 patients.

Predictive Analytics

Elsewhere new predictive analytics software solutions are being developed for global markets in Hungary that will provide more efficient support for the capacity planning of healthcare professionals and the optimal use of equipment reducing waiting lists and helping to save on costs.

“AI is at the heart of GE’s strategy and we are proud to have GE Healthcare’s biggest European Data Science team in Hungary working on several international products and research developments” Ascsillán says.

“Our excellent academic and clinical partners in Hungary as well as across Europe and in the United States are actively involved in our projects validation and testing processes. This extraordinary cooperation provides our multidisciplinary teams with broad access to data and clinical expertise enabling the teams to develop revolutionary healthcare products and services in Hungary for global markets” he adds.

GE’s development of AI has made strides in Hungary. The healthcare division’s Thoracic Care Suite algorithm was the first in Europe to be used in a university environment in Budapest. The solution can detect eight abnormal chest radiograph findings that also support tuberculosis detection and can help spot pneumonia indicative of COVID-19.

This suite of AI algorithms automatically analyses chest X-ray images for the presence of abnormal radiologic findings and flags these immediately including some that are not visible to a radiologist.

“Our vision for the future of healthcare is precision health; where we use the latest technologies like AI and Additive with data from across our portfolio to create insights for better more targeted more individualized patient care” Ascsillán explains.

“At GE we believe that AI can be the new ‘superpower’ for medical professionals as healthcare delivery and related administration become more complex. It can lead to more accurate and faster diagnoses and can free up the time of healthcare professionals to deliver better patient care” the GE vice president concludes.

GE Healthcare has a digital center in Budapest and Szeged (175 km southeast of the capital by road) and a Regional Repair Center in Páty (20 km west of Budapest) employing a staff of 700-plus. More than 400 of those are high-skilled software engineers in R&D positions who work in medical imaging workflow management and artificial intelligence deployment. GE Healthcare Magyaroszág Kft. generated HUF 40 bln in revenue in 2020 an increase on the previous year. A total of five R&D innovation projects were certified during the last year which will be continued in 2021 via an R&D investment of HUF 3 bln.

SPRINGFIELD Ramblers put on an impressive display in the GE Healthcare Senior Women's Challenge Cup quarter-final at John Murphy Memorial Park in Cobh with four goals in the second half securing their passage.

Springfield dominated from start to finish confining Carrigaline in their own half for long periods of time and soaked up any forward moves from the visitors.

Carrigaline though had the first real chance on goal when Sarah O’Neill managed to break through the Springfield defence and drove down the right-hand side only to see her effort go wide of the posts.

Moments later the first Springfield chance came when Amy Burns’ shot on goal from a sharp angle went wide as the home side were beginning to press forward.

The breakthrough came in the 14th minute when Jess Geasley chipped the ball over the Carrigaline keeper and into the top corner for the opening score.

Four minutes later Carrigaline almost equalised when O’Neill dispossessed a Springfield defender and made a run for goal only to be denied by Jemma Savage right in front of goal.

Carrigaline keeper Millie Fitzgerald did well to keep out efforts from Amy Kennedy Isabel O’Leary and Rosie Speakman as the home side were looking for a second and it eventually came in the 35th minute when O’Leary’s pass found Speakman in the area whose low shot found the back of the Carrigaline net.

Carrigaline were being forced to defend in numbers with Springfield’s Aoife O’Brien being denied by the keeper as the ball was cleared out of the penalty area by Carrigaline defenders on the stroke of halftime.

Carrigaline held Springfield with some excellent tackling in midfield with neither team giving way in the early part of the second half and it took something special for the home side to extend their lead when Louise Burke’s 25-yard free kick in the 58th minute was just too strong for Fitzgerald as it slipped through her fingers and into the net.

Chances were falling to Springfield with keeper Fitzgerald doing her best to keep her team in the match but in the 67th minute Springfield had pulled even further away when a throw-in found Robyn O’Sullivan whose pass found Kennedy who made no mistake from 15 yards.

Five minutes later came the goal of the match when Springfield’s Louise Burke noticed Fitzgerald off her line and duly lobbed the ball over the keeper from the halfway line to make it 5-0 in favour of the home side.

Carrigaline despite the scoreline started to encroach more and more into Springfield’s half but were met up against a well-organised backline who thwarted any potential scoring opportunity forcing shots from well outside the area which went wide off the mark. Their best chance fell in the 88th minute when keeper Jemma Savage did well to gather ahead of O’Neill and Holly Fitzgerald and cleared any danger.

Springfield however were able to get behind the Carrigaline defence with another goal from Kennedy in the 90th minute sealing Carrigaline’s fate and Springfield's semi-final berth.

Lakewood 0

MIDLETON claimed the honours in the GE Healthcare CWSSL U16 Medal Final following a 2-0 win over Lakewood at Knockgriffin Park Midleton.

They had to soak up immense pressure from the visitors before Midleton sealed the outcome with the final kick of the game.

The home side attacked from the start with the Lakewood keeper Clodagh Fitzgerald clearing the ball ahead of an advancing Catheranne Fitzgerald in the first minute but moments later Lakewood’s Ornaith Cremin’s pass from the near side found Saoirse Moynihan which was cleared by the Midleton defenders as both teams were showing promise in the early stages.

Midleton’s Kiera Senna forced the Lakewood keeper to come well off her line only to see her effort go wide while at the other end Lakewood’s Meabh McGoldrick’s free kick bounced around in the Midleton penalty area only for Kate O’Riordan’s effort being collected by the Midleton keeper Aisling Stewart.

Lakewood had an opportunity to take the lead when they were awarded a penalty kick in the 26th minute only for Moynihan’s effort going wide of the mark just as the home side were beginning to dominate play.

Both teams had chances late in the first half with Midleton’s Kiera Senna’s shot on goal blocked while Midleton’s defenders managed to scramble the ball away from the six yard box right on the stroke of half time.

Midleton almost opened the scoring within the first minute of the restart when Siobhan Deasy’s effort trickled towards the goal line only to be cleared on the line by a defender while moments later Senna’s dropping shot from 25 went just over the crossbar.

Lakewood had an opportunity shortly after when Orlaith Cremin ran towards the goal only to be denied a goal scoring opportunity with a well-timed challenge by one of the Midleton defenders.

Midleton opened the scoring in the 40th minute when Faye Dunlea’s 35 yard kick lobbed over the Lakewood keeper and into the back of the net.

Lakewood’s Meabh McGoldrick’s free kick was collected by Curtin ahead of an incoming Moynihan while at the other end Midleton’s Gloria Ojelabi’s cross found Ruby Hendrix at the far corner whose effort went over the crossbar as both teams looked for the all important second score.

Lakewood applied the pressure in the final 15 minutes of the match forcing a number of corners in an effort to get back into the game. McGoldrick’s free kick five minutes from time bounced in front of the Midleton goal and it took a few anxious moments for the ball to be cleared away by Midleton who were counting down the final few minutes and seconds as they were forced to defend in numbers.

Midleton broke away in the 70th minute when Kiera Senna’s effort came off the Lakewood keeper and fell neatly to Lainey O’Sullivan who made no mistake from 15 yards to give Midleton the 2-0 win.

CNBC Make It wants to hear from you. Email money reporter Alicia Adamczyk at alicia.adamczyk@nbcuni.com with your story. Gen X workers aged 45 and older may be bearing the brunt of a global unemployment crisis as the pandemic adds to existing challenges for older workers according to a new report. Rapid digital adoption during the pandemic has accelerated the automation of jobs and worsened underlying ageism making it harder for mid-career workers to secure roles according to the report from Generation a non-profit employment organization. In a global study entitled ""Meeting the world's midcareer challenge"" the firm found that entry-level and intermediate workers between the age of 45 and 60 face increased barriers due to biases among hiring managers as well as reluctance among workers to learn new skills. Generation's CEO said the report had for the first time ""put a number on ageism.""

It's very clear that once you reach a certain age it just becomes much harder to access a job opportunity. Dr Mona Mourshed CEO Generation

""This is a demographic that is absolutely in need and it's very clear that once you reach a certain age it just becomes much harder to access a job opportunity"" Mona Mourshed told CNBC Make It.

Ageist misconceptions prevail

The study which was conducted between March and May 2021 surveyed 3800 employed and unemployed people from 18 to 60 years old and 1404 hiring managers across seven countries. Despite the varied international jobs landscape — from the U.S. to the U.K. and India to Italy — the findings were broadly the same: 45- to 60-year-olds are the most overlooked employee bracket. Indeed for the past six years mid-career individuals have made up a consistently high percentage of the long-term unemployed. Most notably the research found that hiring managers across the board considered those who are 45-years-old and above to be the worst cohort in terms of application readiness fitness and previous experience. Among their top concerns were a perceived reluctance among older workers to try new technologies (38%) an inability to learn new skills (27%) and difficulty in working with other generations (21%).

It comes in spite of evidence that older workers often outperform their younger peers. Indeed almost nine in 10 (87%) hiring managers said their hires who are 45 years and above have been as good as — or better — than younger employees. Mourshed said the findings highlight underlying biases at play in the workplace. ""It is often the case that like identifies with like when it comes to 'isms'"" she said. For instance she explained there is a tendency among hiring managers to opt for hires in their age group. Meanwhile C.V.-based interviews can make it hard for candidates to demonstrate their skills she added.

Re-engaging a lost workforce

Training could provide one solution to the issue. Still the report also highlighted a reluctance to pursue training among jobseekers who are 45 years and above. More than half (57%) of entry-level and intermediate-level job seekers expressed a resistance to reskilling while just 1% said training increased their confidence when looking for work. Often that is due to negative experiences of education conflicting personal duties and lack of available programs and financial support for mid-career workers said Mourshed.

This model is the second generation the first came out in 2019 and was based on four year old Sony DPT-RP1 hardware. Fujitsu has always exceled at their robust software experience. You can view documents with a two page spread or a split screen view which is tremendously useful if you are juggling a heavy workload. The model number for the Quaderno A5 is FMVDP51.

Hardware

The Quaderno A5 gen 2 features a 10.3 inch E INK display with a resolution of 1404 x 1872 with 227 PPI. The screen is capacitive so you can use your finger to interact with it and for the first time Fujitsu is utilizing a WACOM display. The inclusion of WACOM means that the accompanied stylus never needs to be recharged and many other stylus on the market is compatible such as the Lamy Al-Star or Remakerable 2 Marker Plus.

One of the most compelling aspect of this device is the new E INK Carta 1250 e-paper technology. It has a thinner film which results in a wider gamut and higher contrast ratio. It also leverages the same updates of Carta 1200 which provides lower latency when using a stylus currently it has 30 milliseconds. PDF files will load faster and the pages will turn faster.

So what exactly is an A5 screen what type of documents does it display? This device is geared towards reading A5 documents and although A5 isn’t as popular as its A4 paper size cousin it is still considered the go-to size for a number of paper projects. Examples include flyers leaflets marketing mailers greeting cards and stationary. It will easily read formats that have been optimized for 5.83 by 8.27 inches. It does a perfectly adequate job of reading PDF files whether they are purely text based a mixture of text and images or very complex ones such as etextbooks.

Underneath the hood is a Cortex A53 Quad-core 1.8 GHZ processor 4 GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage which is good for storing around 10000 PDF files. It has a USB-C port which is great for people who want one cable for all of their devices. It has WIFI Bluetooth 5.0 and NFC support for FeliCa (screen unlock) and NFC Forum Type 4 Tag (easy connection with QUADERNO Mobile App). You will easily get up to 4 weeks of usage before you have to recharge it. The dimensions are 173.2mm x 242.5mm x 5.9mm. This device is one of the lightest on the market and you can easily hold it with just two fingers. The weight is 261g.

The design of the A5 2nd gen is white and has a e-paper screen with 16 levels of greyscale. It comes with a stylus but not a case or screen protector those you have to buy separately. There are three replacement nibs and nib removal tool that come in the box and also a black USB-C cable. The retail packaging is cardboard stock that has a picture of the device on the front with some light tech specs on the back. You get a quick start guide user manual and warranty documentation but it is all in Japanese. You can view translated versions that have been converted to English on the Good e-Reader Knowledgebase.

Overall the build quality of the A5 is quite high and it has enough specs to handle digital note taking or editing a PDF file. This device is much cheaper than the Fujitsu Quaderno A4 2nd gen which retails for $779.99. You can buy it from the Good e-Reader Store for $569.99.

Software

The Fujitsu Quaderno A5 2nd gen is running an Android OS but the exact version number is unknown. It really doesn’t make a difference anyways because heavily skins their operating system so you wouldn’t even know it is running Android.

Fujitsu does not offer a home screen in the traditionally sense. Instead there is a main drop down menu that provides shortcuts to all of the features. This includes your notes settings menu Airscan Schedule File Browser Settings and firmware update. The settings menu is where you can connect up to a WIFI network and establish Bluetooth accessories such as FLICA. This is also where you can control the remapping of your stylus buttons manage your imported templates. There is also a screen lock function which allows you to establish a password for the device. Just make sure you remember the password there is nothing Fujitsu can do to remotely unlock it for you.

The only format that this device can read is PDF files. It cannot read EPUB or MOBI files. You can import in PDF files from Windows Explorer but plugging your Quaderno into your PC with the USB-C to USB-A cable. Simply drag and drop the files and they will be readable and editable when you open them up. When you open up a PDF files of any size turning pages is lighting quick this is primarily due to the new E INK Carta 1250 screen. Whenever you turn a page there is a full page refresh which limits ghosting. There is basically a flash on the screen whenever you turn a page. The Quaderno PDF rendering engine recognizes text on any PDF file so this text can be highlighted or edited. You can use the stylus to take notes anywhere on the document. There is a setting that will reflow the document and basically strip away all of the images and just give you pure text depending on the coplexidly of the file this can be hit or miss. When you pinch and zoom a PDF file there is a percentage meter on the top left corner but there is no mini map to assist in orientation like Amazon does with the Kindle or Kobo. Pinching and zooming overall is super quick there is no lag or anything else it just happens

There are three major ways you can view PDF files. Split screen view which basically can have one PDF file on one side of the screen another PDF file on the other. You can make edits on both of them. There is also a split page view which can have the same PDF file on both sides of the screen effectively giving you the same type of experience as a large hardcover. Additionally you can just read it in portrait mode or switch the orientation to landscape mode. The Quaderno is quite versatile.

I believe the Quaderno A5 provides the best PDF editing editing and viewing experience in the 10.3 class. This is primary due to the sheer number of features for different pen and pencil sizes for varying line thickness. Page turns are the fastest in the business easily beating out the Remarkable 2 Supernote A5X or Onyx Boox Note 3. The latency is so fast when using the stylus to make edits sign documents or fill out a contract is breathtaking. If you want to read a good ebook comic newspaper or the latest manga one of the most popular formats that are available online is PDF so you can easily read any type of media and due to the resolution this type of content is stunning.

One of the big reasons why you should buy the Fujitsu A5 second generation is the main note taking app. It allows you to freehand draw import in shapes or background templates from the Fujitsu website and start creating. When you are done you can save your workspace as a PDF file which can be copied over to your MAC or PAC or shared via email to your collogues.

When it comes to drawing there are 5-6 different pen/pencil sizes you can employ for line thickness. There is also 2 color options blue and red but these colors can’t be viewed directly on the A5 instead you have to export the file back to your PC or smartphone to see it. Colors are good they are relevant for a professor or a teacher to grade tests or make certain aspects of a technical drawing or schematic standout. There are not a ton of advanced features it is geared towards businesses or professionals who want to replace paper in the workspace. I don’t think there is enough advanced features such as layers or pressure sensitivity that do not make it ideal for creative professionals. The Supernote A5X excels in this regard because it supports more formats then just a PDF file and has a ton of note taking enhancements you could just look at their Twitter its littered with really cool drawings artists are making.

Finally there is a really nice schedule app that comes with the device. You can use the stylus or your fingers to click on a specific date and then when you click on that date it provides a breakdown of all 24 hours in a day. You can use the stylus to handwrite specific notes or use the keyboard to write in specific tasks or appointments. When a specific day is edited it will show a notification flag click on it and we will show a bubble of all of the tasks. Basically the schedule feature is simply not a background template but a totally interactive feature that I wish more e-notes had.

How to sideload PDF files?

If you want to copy over your own PDF files into the A5 there are various ways to do it. Firstly you can use Windows Explorer or file browser on MAC. Plugin your A5 into your computer using the USB-C to USB-A cable. You can simply drag and drop all of the PDF files you want to copy from your computer to the A5 you can copy them either just to the root directory or the documents folder. Alternatively Fujitsu also has desktop software for PC and MAC that make the whole process easy. The company also has an Android and iOS app but they can only be downloaded from Japan. The Good e-Reader App Store has the latest version if you want to download it there.

How to save notes?

You can easily save your freehand drawings or notes that you take by clicking on the save option in the UI you can also click on the 3dots for even more advanced settings. You can rename the edited note file or PDF files to whatever you want. Notes save as PDF files this is the only format they can be exported as. They are saved to a documents directory. You can transfer the PDF file from your Quaderno by plugging it into your computer with the USB-C to USB-A cable and then find the edited files you want to copy. Next simply drag and drop them to your PC/MAC.

Do you want to print a PDF that you have edited or a note that you have made? Fujitsu sells a line of ScanSnap printers that you can configure in one of the dropdown menus and configure whatever model that you have purchased.

Wrap Up

Should you buy the Fujitsu A5 Gen 2? The 10.3 inch E INK market is heavily saturated and has a ton of competition. The Onyx Boox Note Air and Note 3 have the same screen size but provide a vastly different experience these are basically multimedia tablets that go far behind note taking or PDF editing but since it is running Android 10 and has Google Play there are millions of apps to download. App performance is increased thanks to the sheet amount of different speed modes that are available which drastically increases the performance at the expense of image quality.

The Remarkable 2 is likely Fujitsu’s major competition since this tablet has multiple language options and is geared towards creative professionals. It was developed from the ground up and is aimed at a similar audience as the Fujitsu. Remarkable has as very expensive marketing campaign to build brand awareness and their ads are all over Facebook Twitter YouTube and Google Search results.

The Fujitsu A5 is aimed at working professionals students and a casual audience. The fact that it supports English really makes it accessible to a worldwide audience. There are various cases available and they even formed a partnership with Lamy a German company that makes premium WACOM stylus and high quality traditional pens.

Fujitsu has only been developing e-notes since 2018 so they do not have a long track record in the industry. Their first and second generation models were based on Sony Digital Paper. The Quaderno A4 and A5 from 2019 were based on the DPT-RP1 and DPT-CP1. The second generation were based on the brand new technology that Sony developed but they aren’t releasing it themselves instead they are licensing out the technology Fujitsu was the first company to bring it to market. Likely there will be others later this year.

In between action set pieces involving the color-coded Holon mechs the writers of the sci-fi series used Michael B. Jordan’s Julian Chase to explore how technology changes one’s humanity and what it means to be a person when you can digitally upload your brain into a giant robot.

Shown during the show’s 2021 San Diego Comic-Con panel gen:Lock’s trailer for season 2 is an endurance test for Chase. Fighting the Union empire with the other gen:Lock pilots means fighting Nemesii Union mechs all powered by a stolen digital copy of his brain. And for someone who already can’t upload themselves back into their human body the self-murdering is starting to wear on him.

“Killing yourself again and again and again. I don’t even know what to do with that” narrates Chase in the trailer.

With each fight bringing more Nemesii it’s easy to see how he sounds so tired of fighting himself all the time. And it’s only the beginning. “Chase has those low points where he doesn’t care about anything” admitted Jordan. He joked that Chase needed therapy and he wasn’t really wrong.

Though not talked about in the panel the trailer made clear right away that Chase’s team would be more vital than ever. Since last we saw Cammie (Maisie Williams) Kazu (Koichi Yamadera) Val/ (Asia Kate Dillon) and Yasamin (Golshifteh Farahani) their bonds have only grown and the ability to share their minds with one another has given them all a unique connection to each other. As Chase goes to “new lows” in the season Jordan also promised that his spark and emotional connections would slowly return. Like in any anime the power of friendship is the key.

Digging deeper into its characters sounds like one of the core goals for gen:Lock season 2 as Dakota Fanning said that her character Miranda Worth would get her own “intense” arc that’ll call her values into question. “We see her get pulled into different directions” Fanning explained “and the inner struggle she has with her career and her relationships.”

Though it sounds like a tease about the dynamic between Miranda and Chase who she dated prior to his apparent death it’s worth remembering that she came to be a drill sergeant for the other gen:Lock pilots. And to Fanning her empathy is what’ll get Miranda through the season. “She’s a good person and she tries to make decisions that are ethical and true to herself.”

For as much as gen:Lock got right in its first season the world-building was still a bit underbaked. The show never properly explained what the global conflict was about between the Union and the Polity the faction the characters fight for. New showrunner Dan Dominguez promised that for season 2 the sides will become more clearly defined in the first episode. He even went further in calling the Union a hyper-religious state run as a “post-capitalist theocracy” and calling the Polity an oligarchy of secular capitalists.

It was easy for the Union to be painted as evil in season 1. Not only were they slowly conquering the planet with an army of tanks and nanotech-using foot soldiers they were inserting spies to steal gen:Lock technology. But the goal is to better flesh them out and their leader Brother Tate. On that front Dominguez used the oft-deployed phrase to describe the character: “Everyone is sure they’re the hero in their own story.”

Through the eyes of the gen:Lock team and Rob Sinclair (Blaine Gibson) a potential gen:Lock pilot trying to escape Union territory after being kidnapped the portrayal of the conflict and the Union will hopefully be shown a little more evenly. Minus the part where they tortured Chase’s digital brain and made an infinite army of him.

According to a press release from Army released on Friday the service has picked BAE Systems General Dynamics Land Systems Point Blank Enterprises American Rheinmetall Vehicles and Point Blank Enterprises for a 15-month-long program to digital concept designs for the OMFV.

The concept design phase reflects the Army’s effort to structure a program that incentivizes industry innovation provides the analytical underpinnings for the development of an abbreviated capability development document and begin the design maturation process.

- ADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW -

The overarching strategy for the program – a five-phased approach to design prototype test and produce the OMFV. This approach focuses on encouraging innovation maximizing competition throughout the entire program and producing a transformational Infantry fighting Vehicle (IFV) that will dominate maneuver in Multi-Domain Operations (MDO).

The OMFV is considered to be a replacement for the Army’s aging Bradley Fighting Vehicle.

The OMFV will be designed to maneuver Soldiers in the future operating environment to a position of advantage to engage in close combat and deliver decisive lethality during the execution of combined arms maneuver.

Army expected that the new combat vehicle will exceed current capabilities while overmatching similar threat class systems.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vbmF0aW9uYWxpbnRlcmVzdC5vcmcvYmxvZy9yZWJvb3QvMTIwMDAtcm91bmRzLW1pbnV0ZS1jb3VsZG50LXNhdmUtZ3VuLWZhaWx1cmUtMTkwMzY30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,12000 Rounds a Minute Couldn't Save This Gun From Failure,"The new weapon quickly became the black sheep of the gun family.

Here's What You Need to Remember: Gatling patented his rapid-firing gun in 1862 and experimented with electric power 30 years later. G.E. revived the idea with modern technology and materials after World War II.

General Electric’s armament division struck it big when it brought Gatling guns back in the late 1950s. The company hoped it could sell different models for almost every conceivable mission.

So less than a decade after introducing the iconic Minigun the Vermont-based defense contractor developed yet another multiple-barrel light machine gun. The designers expected the new “Microgun” to be a popular alternative to traditional infantry weapons.

But the new weapon quickly became the black sheep of the gun family.

“The effectiveness of a lightweight small-caliber high rate-of-fire aircraft machine gun has been proven in Vietnam” a sales brochure notes. “In an effort to further extend the effectiveness of such weapons and systems General Electric Company … funded design and development program of a 5.56-millimeter Minigun.”

The gun weighed 28 pounds with an integral electric motor—only three pounds more than the Minigun all by itself. And the Microgun was fewer than 30 inches long making it shorter than an M-16 rifle.

On top of that the new machine gun used the same 5.56-millimeter ammunition as that weapon. G.E. touted this as a major selling point.

“[The Microgun has the] lowest cost per round fired because of the inherently lower cost of the 5.56-millimeter round” the promotional literature boasts. “The … round is a standard stock item in the services.”

Otherwise the machine gun functioned just like its larger brethren. The designs were based on work Richard Gatling had done almost a century before.

Gatling patented his rapid-firing gun in 1862 and experimented with electric power 30 years later. G.E. revived the idea with modern technology and materials after World War II.

Like its predecessors the 5.56-millimeter weapon had six rotating barrels each with their own firing pin. As the entire mechanism spun around cartridges would load move into position and fire.

The empty casings would pop out at the other end of the cycle. The weapon could theoretically fire up to a blistering 10000 shots per minute.

With all of these benefits G.E. quickly caught the attention of both the U.S. Army and Air Force. The ground and flying branches wanted to test out the machine gun—renamed the XM-214—on aircraft helicopters and armored vehicles.

In principle the Microgun could replace Miniguns on heavily armed gunship aircraft and attack helicopters. The smaller lighter weapons would free up space for extra ammo other gear or just more guns.

Company literature proposed mounting the guns at any open doors in the wings or in an aircraft’s nose. Engineers also offered up the option of putting half a dozen guns in a modified bomb bay.

Smaller planes or choppers might be able to carry the new machine guns even if they couldn’t handle larger Gatling guns. G.E. planned to sell a gun-pod loaded with a gun battery and up to 300 rounds of ammo as well.

And the high rate of fire could give troops on the ground the advantage in an ambush. Standard M-2 or M-60 machine guns spat out a comparatively anemic 600 bullets every minute.

“Success is determined by the immediate and violent reaction to the ambush” an official Army manual for tankers going to Vietnam notes.

In addition G.E. tried to prompt the U.S. Navy to buy the guns for its fleet of riverine craft. Patrol boats and the elite SEALs had to contend with enemy surprise attacks on Vietnam’s rivers too.

Marketing pamphlets even suggest the guns could plug into an automated defense network. The company’s artists drew conical turrets that look a lot like the Daleks from Dr. Who.

But in the end all three armed services found that the Microgun’s positive features couldn’t make up for its biggest shortcoming—the small 5.56-millimeter bullet.

The gun’s accuracy suffered especially when firing from a fast-moving airplane or helicopter. The light projectiles tossed around in the slipstream.

And the tiny bullets simply didn’t have the range of the larger 7.62-millimeter and .50-caliber rounds. An infantryman might not mind in close quarters but aircraft pilots and vehicle gunners could expect to fight at longer distances.

In the face of these concerns G.E. tried to refocus its efforts. The company rebranded the Microgun as a good lightweight weapon for ground forces.

The resulting weapon system dubbed the “Six-Pak” combined the machine gun with a tripod ammunition magazine and portable power pack.

The magazine was meant to keep up with the fast-firing gun and the demands of infantry combat. The bullets came in 500-round “factory packaged … disposable containers—eliminating handling of ammunition belts” according to George Chinn in his authoritative The Machine Gun.

“After the first cassette is emptied … it can automatically link … [to] the preceding cassette” Chinn adds. “The total ready-rounds [on the Six-Pak] are then restored to 1000.”

But the Army remained disinterested. G.E. couldn’t find any other customers for the weapon.

When G.E. eventually sold off its armament division General Dynamics picked up the whole family of Gatling guns including the Microgun. Four years ago the North Carolina arms producer was still offering the fast-firing machine gun.

The General Dynamics brochure claims its XM-214 can fire up to 12000 rounds every 60 seconds. The rest of the language is virtually identical to the older pamphlets.

In 2011 General Dynamics finally stopped pitching the gun on its Website. After four decades no one had purchased any significant number of Microguns.

It is also one of America’s most common aircraft.

Initially introduced by General Dynamics in 1978 (the company is now part of Lockheed Martin) the F-16 grew into one of the most appreciated and successful machines of its kind.Officially named Fighting Falcon the plane got rechristened Viper by its pilots on account of several reasons starting from a resemblance some of them see with the namesake snake and ending with pilots wanting to feel like the ones flying Battlestar Galactica’s Colonial Viper starfighter.Despite its age and the fact that there are so many of them out there the F-16 still manages to impress every time it shows up. And if a skilled photographer is on deck to capture from very close in the air the effect is even more exciting.This is what happened back in June during the Red Flag -Alaska 21-2 exercise where 1500 pilots and crew took to the sky in various airplanes. The main pic of this piece (click to enlarge) was taken back then by Airman 1st Class Mario Calabro and published last week by the Air Force.What you’re looking at is an F-16 Fighting Falcon deployed with an unspecified unit wearing a viper-like camo. The plane is seen as it is getting in position for air refueling after “an air-combat maneuvering sortie over Joint Pacific Alaska Range Complex.” It still has weapons attached to its hardpoints.The F-16 is capable of reaching speeds of Mach 2 and can fly for as much as 2620 miles (4217 km). It took part in pretty much all the wars we’re familiar with from the Iraq and Balkan conflicts of the early 1990s to the more recent ones in Iraq and Afghanistan.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vZGVmYnJpZWYuY29tLzIwMjEvMDcvMjQvdXMtYXJteS1waWNrcy1maXZlLWNvbXBldGl0b3JzLWZvci1pdHMtb3B0aW9uYWxseS1tYW5uZWQtZmlnaHRpbmctdmVoaWNsZS1wcm9ncmFtL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US Army picks five competitors for its Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle program,"The US Army has selected five competitors that will proceed to the second stage of the concept design phase of its Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle (OMFV) program.

The selected teams are led by Point Blank Enterprises Oshkosh Defense BAE Systems Land and Armaments General Dynamics Land Systems and American Rheinmetall Vehicles.

The total award value for all five contracts is approximately $299.4 million. The service selected the vendors after previously being forced to cancel and redraw its approach to finding a successor for the M-2 Bradley IFV.

The new approach allows companies to offer ideas and concept solutions for a problem described by the army and not respond to a set of pre-defined requirements.

During this phase of the program industry will develop digital designs while requirements mature; prototypes will be required in the following phase.

Point Blank Enterprises is working with Keshik Mobile Power Systems to offer what it says will be an innovative design with a modular and technology-agnostic open systems approach for power information and physical architectures.

BAE Systems has teamed up with Elbit Systems of America to explore crew automation active protection and other transformational combat vehicle technologies and turret solutions for the program.

American Rheinmetall Vehicles has joined forces with Textron Systems and L3Harris to submit an OMFV proposal based on its Lynx IFV.

General Dynamics Land Systems will offer a vehicle based on the Next Gen Bradley while Oshkosh Defense will work with South Korea’s Hanwha Defense on proposing a design based on the latter’s Redback IFV.

“The concept design phase reflects the Army’s effort to structure a program which incentivizes industry innovation and provides the analytical underpinnings for the development of an abbreviated capability development document” said Brig. Gen. Glenn Dean program executive officer for Ground Combat Systems.

The initial digital design will inform the first formal OMFV requirements document known as the A-CDD which will be published in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022.

“This process allows the Army to make future decisions on the design without overly constricting vendor efforts to innovate” said Dean.

The overarching five-phase strategy for the OMFV program remains unchanged – the army said it remains focused on encouraging innovation maximizing competition throughout the entire program and producing a transformational infantry fighting vehicle.

“The OMFV will bring a transformative change to the battlefield providing new technology and new capabilities to our formations” said Maj. Gen. Ross Coffman director of the Next Generation Combat Vehicles Cross Functional Team. “Once these designs are completed our soldiers will engage with the designs and will provide feedback and input to ensure we are providing the equipment they need to defend our great nation.”

Following the concept design phase the Army intends to have a another full and open competition for the detailed design phase (phase III) with the intent to award up to three contracts in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023.

The detailed design phase awardees will transition into phase IV of the program to build and test actual prototypes. The Army intends to downselect to one vendor at Milestone C (for low rate initial production) near the end of fiscal year 2027.

The Army’s OMFV is an optionally manned platform that maneuvers soldiers to a point of positional advantage to engage in close combat and deliver decisive lethality during the execution of combined arms maneuver. It is designed to operate with or without a crew and soldiers under armor based on the commander’s decision while also controlling maneuver robotics and semi-autonomous systems."

The calendar may read July for one more week but General Mills' Monster Cereals are already being spotted in stores. Arguably most exciting of all the boxes this year are being reverted to the retro designs the cereals were first introduced in all to celebrate the line's 50th birthday. Pictures of the ""new"" box designs began circulating over social media over the past week and now one eagle-eyed Redditor has spotted the Big Three at a local Sam's Club — Boo Berry Count Chocula and Frankenberry. All three box designs have reverted to the retro design for the year.

The cereals are typically seasonal offerings that pop up in stores as spooky season begins to ramp up. Since it is the brand's 50th anniversary however you can expect a hefty marketing campaign is in tow from General Mills (they even released monster cereal action figures) and maybe the sooner the cereals are out the better this year. In fact retro snack tracker Dinosaur Dracula shared a set of the boxes last week that he's giving away to one lucky follower.

Ghoulish giveaway time! Follow me and RT this tweet for a chance to win a set of the NEW Monster Cereals in these swank retro boxes! Must be in the United States to enter. I'll randomly select a winner on Saturday 7/24 at 8PM EST! pic.twitter.com/WCBssn5pdK — Dinosaur Dracula 🦖🧛‍♂️ (@DinosaurDracula) July 22 2021

General Mills also happens to be releasing an all-new product this fall called Monster Mash. Box art for the cereal surfaced online earlier this year and it looks to combine all of the cereals in one box. All five of the monsters are seen on the box art for that product including Yummy Mummy and Fruit Brute.

If so let us know either in the comments section or by hitting our writer @AdamBarnhardt up on Twitter to chat all things snacks!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9kcmFrZXMtb3JnYW5pYy1zcGlyaXRzLW1peC1pbmNsdWRlcy12ZW50dXJlLWNhcGl0YWwvNjAwMDgxMzM5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Maple Plain-based Drake's Organic Spirits mix includes venture capital,"Mark Anderson grew up on a farm in North Dakota and graduated from the University of North Dakota in business and aviation with the requisite certifications to be a pilot.

But those jobs were scarce amid airline layoffs in the early 1990s. In the three decades since he traded commodities invested in energy equipment and created an organic distillery.

That latest business — Maple Plain-based Drake's Organic Spirits — is one of the Minnesota companies that has raised a sizable amount of venture capital this year.

Last month Drake's Organic closed a third private placement of stock at $7 million following two earlier raises that provided $11.4 million. At the moment investors give the company an implied value of $70 million.

""I just want to focus on the work"" Mark Anderson said. ""Our goal was to build something new and we're doing it. We've doubled sales every year since 2017.""

Drake's distilled 12 times is a premium brand that prices competitively at $20 or $21 per bottle thanks to little overhead and supply-chain control.

Anderson expects profitable sales this year of up to $20 million. Anderson and his wife Kristen remain the single-largest shareholders.

For Mark Anderson who is 51 the success is the climax of a career with several twists.

He got into commodity trading after he saw the 1980s movie ""Trading Places"" thinking the business would make him successful enough to own an airplane.

""In 'Trading Places' with commodity trading they were kind of farming on paper"" Anderson recalled of the comedy. ""I decided to do some research.""

Anderson eventually opened an account with a clearing firm made a deposit of $4000 borrowed on a credit card and leased a seat on the Minneapolis Grain Exchange for $15 a month.

""I walked into the pit got badge No. 357 and I was an independent trader"" Anderson recalled. ""Hard spring red wheat contracts. I figured out how markets were made and moved and the dynamics of market makers. When the Archer-Daniels-Midland's broker's phone rang we knew he would be a seller. And when the General Mills broker's phone rang he would be a buyer.

""I had some great days and made lots of money. But you also lose 90% of the time. So you have to be good enough to do much better on your winners.""

In 1998 he took a position with North Central Cos. buying and selling physical commodities such as dairy powders cheese and grain. He started a company called Killer Whale leveraging with derivatives that helped him control a significant portion of the dairy markets from 2000 to 2004. He retired that year a multimillionaire.

Mark and Kristen whom he met at UND live on a 29-acre horse ranch in Maple Plain. They own former race horses and other animals rescued through Kristen's nonprofit Long Lake Animal Rescue.

Mark Anderson also made money investing in pipe manufacturers serving the North Dakota energy boom in the mid-2000s. He says he missed a huge win by not directly investing in the industry during the 2008-09 collapse when valuations hit bottom.

""Anybody who only tells you about the wins is probably full of B.S."" he said. ""I've had my misses. And I'm grateful for my wife our kids and our success. We started out broke. I'm also wealthy in everything money can't buy.""

Kristen Anderson has a passion for healthy lifestyles that combined with Mark Anderson's penchant for researching and understanding markets and led them after careful study to launch Drake's Organic Spirits.

Earlier they had launched Captain Drake's — a provider of organic ingredients such as citric acid and organic cane sugar to the food and beverage industry.

Mark Anderson said Drake's Organic is the only spirits company to achieve five certifications: vegan gluten-free non-GMO kosher and USDA organic.

And the Andersons who raised two college-age daughters have hired New York investment banker Cohen & Co. to field inquiries from larger alcoholic beverage companies interesting in how they've exploited the organic niche successfully.

They eschewed grain-based alcohol and sourced cane sugar from the Cauca Valley of Colombia where the organic alcohol is distilled. No herbicides or pesticides.

Anderson doesn't drink alcohol. His wife and others are the tasters. ""I choose to be clear-headed at all times"" he said.

Anderson who has focused on sourcing ingredients markets and the growing health movement built a lean company of only 12 people. The firm leverages capital and expertise by using contractors to distill bottle and package products including the fast-growing ""boxtail"" line of Drake's drinks.

Drake's distributes nationally through Southern Glazer's Wine and Spirits.

""We control our own supply chain for organic alcohol"" Anderson said. ""In 2020 we sold 40000 cases. This year we forecast 200000 cases. We have capacity for 12 million cases.''

Bill Hawks a 20-year business partner and friend of Anderson's called him ""a humble guy who looks like a movie star. He attracts people. And he's a good guy who does a lot of business stuff really well. He has the vision … and then put all the parts together.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9taWx3YXVrZWUvbmV3cy8yMDIxLzA3LzI1L2hzYS1jb21tZXJjaWFsLWJ1aWxkaW5ncy1qb2luLXVucHJlY2VkZW50ZWQuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,HSA Commercial buildings join 'unprecedented' industrial development in southeast Wisconsin - Milwaukee Business ...,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.bizjournals.com/milwaukee/news/2021/07/25/hsa-commercial-buildings-join-unprecedented.html on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9taWx3YXVrZWUvbmV3cy8yMDIxLzA3LzI1L2hzYS1jb21tZXJjaWFsLWJ1aWxkaW5ncy1qb2luLXVucHJlY2VkZW50ZWQuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsbGhhbGxvd3NnZWVrLmNvbS9jb3VudC1jaG9jdWxhLWFuZC1mcmFua2VuLWJlcnJ5LWdldHRpbmctYWxsLW5ldy02LWluY2gtc2NhbGUtZmlndXJlcy1mcm9tLWphZGEtdG95cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Count Chocula and Franken Berry Getting All-New 6-Inch Scale Figures from Jada Toys,"This article contains affiliate links.

The price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) is one of the most popular metrics of stock price. It is often used as a crude indicator of market sentiment as a simple easily understandable ratio.

When the prices are significantly above the historical averages of P/E 12-15 stocks in single digits mandate further examination. Is there more than meets the eye? Or is the market's lack of favor a correct opinion?

Today we examine one of those stocks in General Motors Company ( NYSE:GM ). The ratio of 8.8x might make it look like a strong buy right now compared to the market in the United States where around half of the companies have P/E ratios above 19x and even P/E's above 39x is quite common.

Latest Developments

Recent times have been advantageous for General Motors as its earnings have been rising faster than most other companies.It might be that many expect the strong earnings performance to degrade substantially which has repressed the P/E.If you like the company you'd be hoping this isn't the case so that you could potentially pick up some stock while it's out of favor.

The company is rallying to join the electric vehicle (EV) party working on as many as 30 new EV models are coming out within the next 3 years. Yet swiftness is the enemy of precision – just days ago they announced a recall of 69000 Chevrolet Bolt vehicles due to fire risk concerns. This is the second such occurrence since the problem has not been fixed after an initial recall in November. Unless GM can identify defective batteries they will have to suffer the cost of complete replacement. Earlier this year Hyundai Motor Co faced a similar problem that ended up as a US$900m loss.

Additionally in the wake of the global shortage of semiconductor chips GM is halting the production of full-size pickup trucks for at least one week.

What Are Growth Metrics Telling Us About The Low P/E?

To justify its P/E ratio General Motors would need to produce anemic growth that's substantially trailing the market.

If we review the last year of earnings growth the company posted a terrific increase of 89%.Although this is skewed with the 2020 market crash as its longer-term performance hasn't been as strong with three-year EPS growth being relatively non-existent.

Turning to the outlook the next three years should generate growth of 3.0% per annum as estimated by the analysts watching the company. The company is positioned for weaker earnings results with the market predicted to deliver 14% growth per year.

Story continues

We can see why General Motors is trading at a P/E lower than the market.It seems most investors are expecting to see limited future growth and are only willing to pay a reduced amount for the stock.

The Bottom Line On General Motors' P/E

Generally our preference is to limit the use of the price-to-earnings ratio to establishing what the market thinks about the overall health of a company.

We've established that General Motors maintains its low P/E on the weakness of its forecast growth lower than the wider market.Right now shareholders accept the low P/E as they concede future earnings probably won't provide any pleasant surprises.Unless these conditions improve they will continue to form a barrier for the share price around these levels. While the good catalysts might include the success of GM subsidiaries like autonomous vehicle startup Cruise  it remains to be seen.

You should always think about risks. Case in point we've spotted 1 warning sign for General Motors you should be aware of.

First reported by the Detroit Free Press GM claims the name is too close to Super Cruise the name of is own hands-free driving technology introduced in 2017 and to its autonomous vehicle subsidiary Cruise. GM is suing Ford for trademark infringement and unspecified damages.

In the lawsuit filed Friday GM said in that the companies had been involved in “protracted discussions” over the name but were unable to resolve the matter. “Ford knew exactly what it was doing” GM alleges in its complaint adding that if Ford “wanted to adopt a new unique brand it easily could have done so without using the word ‘Cruise.’”

Ford announced BlueCruise as the name for its hands-free driver assist system in April and said it would begin pushing the feature via an over-the-air software updates to select vehicles later this year.

GM didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment Saturday. The company told the Free Press that it would have preferred to resolve the situation amicably but was “left with no choice but to vigorously defend our brands and protect the equity our products and technology have earned over several years in the market.”

A Ford spokesperson called GM’s Cruise claim “meritless and frivolous” in a statement emailed to The Verge saying that cruise control is a well-known term. “Every automaker offers it and ‘cruise’ is common shorthand for the capability. That’s why BlueCruise was chosen as the name for the Blue Oval’s next evolution of Ford’s Intelligent Adaptive Cruise Control” the spokesperson added (the “Blue Oval” refers to Ford’s logo).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcmFuZGRyaXZlci5jb20vbmV3cy9hMzcxMTQzNDQvaG9uZGEtZ20tbGVhc2luZy1ydWxlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Honda GM Say You Can't Sell Your Lease to Someone outside the Brand,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a37114344/honda-gm-leasing-rules/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcmFuZGRyaXZlci5jb20vbmV3cy9hMzcxMTQzNDQvaG9uZGEtZ20tbGVhc2luZy1ydWxlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdyZWVuY2FyY29uZ3Jlc3MuY29tLzIwMjEvMDcvMjAyMTA3MjQtc2NydWlzZS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GM introduces new Super Cruise features to 6 MY2022 vehicles,"General Motors will introduce new Super Cruise capabilities on six model year 2022 vehicles in the first quarter of 2022. Super Cruise is the first true hands-free driver-assistance technology allowing drivers to travel hands-free on more than 200000 miles of compatible roads across the US and Canada.





Super Cruise adds hands-free trailering.

New capabilities include:

Trailering. Customers will be able to trailer their boat camper and more while driving hands-free.

These enhancements will be available on select model year 2022 Super Cruise enabled vehicles including Cadillac Escalade Cadillac CT4 Cadillac CT5 Chevrolet Silverado GMC HUMMER EV Pickup and GMC Sierra.

GM’s vehicle intelligence platform which provides more bandwidth and data processing power enabled these enhancements and underscores GM’s software expertise. The digital platform also enables GM to provide over-the-air updates to select model year 2021 vehicle owners allowing them to take full advantage of Super Cruise’s latest enhancements.

Super Cruise will be available on 22 vehicles by 2023 including Cadillac LYRIQ and GMC HUMMER EV SUV. Additional vehicles that offer versions of Super Cruise include the 2022 Cadillac XT6 and the 2022 Chevrolet Bolt EUV.

On Friday the S&P 500 index crossed the 4400-mark for the first time while the Dow Jones Industrial Average moved past 35000 and reached a new high. Meanwhile weekly jobless claims increased unexpectedly to around 419000 dampening hopes of labor market recovery.

Continuing its buyout spree Accenture bought two technology companies early this week — Toronto-based Oracle cloud service provider Cloudworks and workforce optimization consultancy Workforce Insight – and completed the previously announced acquisition of France-based cybersecurity firm Openminded.

In another tech deal Microsoft agreed to acquire security start-up CloudKnox. Meanwhile Visa clinched a deal to buy Currencycloud for about 700 million pounds.

The airline industry dominated the earnings scene this week with United Airlines reporting results on Tuesday and Southwest Airlines and American Airlines releasing their second-quarter statements on Thursday. Earlier IBM came out with positive numbers for its most recent quarter on Monday. The next day all eyes were on streaming giant Netflix which published mixed results in the after-hours.

Energy firm Kinder Morgan Seagate Technology Verizon soft drink major Coca-Cola and Johnson & Johnson stole the show on Wednesday. Thursday was as busy as usual with the major events being the second-quarter earnings releases of telecom firm AT&T fast-food chain Domino’s Pizza Biogen Abbott Laboratories Intel as well as social networking platforms Twitter and Snap. Schlumberger American Express and Kimberly-Clark reported Friday before the opening bell.

While Lockheed Martin is probably the only major company to report earnings on July 26 the market will be closely following the report of Alphabet on July 27. The Google parent will be joined by gadget giant Apple chipmaker AMD Starbucks and Microsoft in the after-hours. Before the opening bell aviation firm JetBlue and engineering behemoth General Electric are scheduled to report earnings.

The financial releases of Bristol-Myers Squibb aircraft builder Boeing and Ford Motor are the key events slated for July 28. The next day is going to be as hectic when the earnings announcements of e-commerce giant Amazon.com Altria Group Yum! Brands and Merck & Co. are on tap. Procter & Gamble oil giant ExxonMobil and Caterpillar are among the major companies preparing to report on July 30.

The country spent the next century paying off the debt to its former slave owners France.

It's a financial conundrum that those experts and historians say have helped keep some formerly colonized countries impoverished: the demand by former slave owners and colonizers for pay in exchange for independence.

The French recognized Haiti's independence in 1825 but in return demanded a hefty indemnity of 100 million francs approximately $21 billion (USD) today. It took Haitians more than a century to pay off the debt to its former slave owners and lenders including the City Bank of New York experts who spoke with ABC News said.

""By forcing Haiti to pay for its freedom France essentially ensured that the Haitian people would continue to suffer the economic effects of slavery for generations to come"" said Marlene Daut a professor at University of Virginia specializing in pre-20th century French colonial literary and historical studies.

Money that could have gone toward erecting a country was channeled to France Daut said. And France had already profited immensely from slaves producing sugar and coffee said Alyssa Sepinwall a history professor at California State University San Marcos.

Since 2004 the bicentennial of the Haitian Revolution Haiti has unsuccessfully sought compensation from France. After Haiti was hit by a devastating earthquake in 2010 that left approximately 250000 people dead international activists urged the French president to reimburse Haiti's ""independence debt"" in the form of disaster relief -- an amount totaling $20 billion. The government has yet to respond to these requests.

The Elysee the official residence of the President of the French Republic told ABC News in a request for comment: ""there’ll be no reaction from Elysee on that matter.""

The country's GDP remains extremely low at $1149.50 per capita and nearly 60% of Haitians currently live in poverty. Even though the country has finished paying off its debt and interest by 1947 its economy has not advanced significantly because it is particularly vulnerable to natural disasters and corruption.

Ralph Emmanuel Francois a Haitian and CEO of a social enterprise in Haiti said the debt left a gaping hole in Haiti's economy and believes France should pay reparations to Haiti. ""I'm saying that they also have a responsibility about what they did to us and how they you know stole our economy that we could use for our benefit"" Francois said.

A similar tale: Jamaica asking to zero out the balance

Jamaica another Caribbean island that was a British colony from 1707 until it gained independence in 1962 is also preparing a petition asking Britain to compensate an estimate of 7.6 billion pounds to descendants of former indentured African slaves who were forced to work on sugar plantations according to Mike Henry a member of Jamaican Parliament.

Henry whose private motion served as the basis for the petition said his motion is about addressing the human rights abuse former slaves had to endure and added that the motion is first to pursue a political approach in asking reparations for chattel slavery.

The motion has since been approved by the National Commission on Reparations which examines cases for reparations for descendants of slaves in Jamaica.

Jamaica was considered the richest British colony of the time and slavery was regarded as the key to wealth. A Cambridge report on legacies of British slave ownership found that 15 to 20% of wealthy British directly benefited from slavery. After the abolition of slavery in 1835 the British government compensated its slave owners with 20 million pounds which is worth 2 billion pounds today.

An international push to address legacies of slavery

The death of George Floyd at the hands of law enforcement reverberated on a global scale prompting the U.N. human rights chief to inspect the issue of racism across nations.

A report published by U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet in June stated that there is a ""long-overdue need to confront the legacies of enslavement the transatlantic trade in enslaved Africans and colonialism and to seek reparatory justice."" Discussing the report further the human rights chief called on all countries to ""stop denying racism…. confront past legacies and deliver redress.""

France has ""amnesia"" when it comes to dealing with its past about slavery history professor Sepinwall said.

""This is so long ago and I think that's one reason why there's not been a push among French citizens to say we need to be accountable for this"" said Sepinwall. ""The political will is not there in France for this to happen sadly because not enough people recognize what happened.""

Former French president Jacques Chirac said in 2000: ""Haiti was not strictly speaking a French colony.""

There is reason to be skeptical about the U.N.'s efforts Sepinwall said because there were often gaps between its rhetoric and action.

""It is also about accountability. It is also about responsibility. Not only saying that I'm sorry but also saying that I am fully responsible for that"" said Francois.",,,,,,,,,,,,

This was quite possibly the largest rock audience that had assembled anywhere in the world since the start of the pandemic and he wanted to bask in their glow.

“Take a look around you” he said. “This is human contact. We cannot be locked up anymore. We need to be together.”

It was a sentiment shared by every performer throughout the five-and-a-half hour concert which also featured the Interrupters Weezer and Fall Out Boy and it was almost enough to make you forget that the Delta variant is causing infection spikes all over America mask mandates are returning and the future is suddenly feeling very uncertain again. But the youthful crowd seemed unbothered by this and masks were worn by no more than one out of every 300 people.

Covid issues aside the show was wildly entertaining and well worth the nearly two-year wait fans have had to endure since the initial tour announcement. Like a 2005 iPod set to shuffle it veered from “Sugar We’re Goin Down” to “Beverly Hills” to “Wake Me Up When September Ends” and since none of the artists have been on the road since in over a year and a half they all had energy of racehorses freed from their starting gates.

After a quick opening set by the L.A. ska punk band the Interrupters who won over the crowd with their unique take on Billie Eilish’s “Bad Guy” Weezer came out. It was hard to recognize Rivers Cuomo for a moment because of his new mustache and mullet look not to mention his studded leather jacket that shows he’s really embracing this whole Van Weezer era.

Editor’s picks

The early part of their set was heavy on new songs like “Hero” “All The Good Ones” and “The End of the Game” a bold move for a stadium show but the opening notes of “My Name is Jonas” triggered a flood of classics like “Undone – The Sweater Song” “Surf Wax America” and “Island In The Sun.” No matter how many times they’ve played them over the years they always work.

“El Scorcho” generated some of the loudest cheers of the night thanks to the line about asking a girl out to a Green Day concert and the inevitable “Africa” came not longer after it. Cuomo got a little confused when he got to the “I stopped an old man along the way” part and started just muttering “blah blah blah.” Perhaps the fact that Weezer’s biggest hit in years is a novelty cover of a 1982 Toto song has left him less than thrilled. The audience took over until the recovered on the chorus. After the live debut of “California Snow” they ended with singalong renditions of “Say It Ain’t So” and “Buddy Holly.”

Fall Out Boy are the slight odd ones out on the bill since they weren’t graduates from the MTV class of 1994 like Weezer and Green Day which Pete Wentz acknowledged midway through their set. “Imagine what a mind fuck this is for our band” he said. “Our band is so influenced by these bands that to be on a stadium tour with them is absolutely mind-blowing. Dream big you know what I mean?”

They certainly dreamed big with the stage show which included more pyro than your typical Kiss concert including flames that shot directly out of Wentz’s bass during their opening number of “The Phoenix.” And when Patrick Stump sat down at the piano to sing “Save Rock and Roll” that burst into flames as well. There was also a video intro by actor Ron Livingstone that he delivered like Rod Serling of The Twilight Zone.

Their set featured just a single song from 2018’s Mania (“The Last of the The Real Ones”) and was instead a journey through their hits including relatively recent ones like “Uma Thurman” and “Centuries” and vintage ones like “Dance Dance” and “A Little Less Sixteen Candles a Little More Touch Me.” The younger members of the crowd sang along to every word while the older ones sipped their beers and looked on respectfully.

Fall Out Boy wasn’t a band that seemed built for the long run when they broke big with teens in 2005. And when they took an indefinite break in 2009 it was easy to imagine them going the way of Gym Class Heroes. But they had one of the most surprisingly successful second acts in rock history and this tour could be the start of a third one since it is basically establishing them as a classic rock group. Who would have guessed?

By the time Green Day took the stage the sun was down and the crowd was primed for the main event. An explosive “American Idiot” got things started and they kept the intensity up by going right into “Holiday” and “Know Your Enemy.” Their album Father of All… hit just a little over a year ago but they didn’t play a thing from it. It was instead classics like “Longview” “Welcome to Paradise” and “Brain Stew” and they caused the GA area near the stage to erupt into a giant mosh pit straight out of 1994. A large group of bros even ripped their shirts off and started slamming into each other and everyone near them letting off 18 months of lockdown steam in a few crazed minutes of Dookie chaos.

Selections from American Idiot were sprinkled through the entire set including an epic “Jesus of Suburbia” and a moving “Wake Me Up When September Ends.” These songs were written for the George W. Bush era but they don’t seem like relics in any way. We’ve only grown more idiotic as a nation since W’s term ended and these songs are now timeless anthems.

Near the end they broke out “Still Breathing” from 2016’s under-appreciated Revolution Radio. It’s about finding meaning in life after difficult times and it had a newfound resonance in the Covid era. “I’m like a soldier coming home for the first time” Armstrong sang. “I dodged a bullet and I walked across a landmine/Oh I’m still alive.”

It was a joy to sing along with those words and it was a joy to experience live rock and roll in a stadium after all this time. We don’t know what the next few months may hold but at least for one glorious night we were all still breathing and still singing.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBhcGVyY2l0eW1hZy5jb20vY3VsdHVyZS9zcG9ydGluZy1saWZlL2Nhcmxvcy1jb3JyZWEtZGVmZW5zaXZlLW12cC1ob3VzdG9uLWFzdHJvcy1oZXgtdGV4YXMtcmFuZ2Vycy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Carlos Correa is a Defensive Unicorn — and His Presence Makes the Astros Better Every Day,"Carlos Correa and Yordan Alvarez are used to winning with the Houston Astros.

Astros shortstop Carlos Correa is one of the best defensive shortstops in all of baseball.(Photo by F. Carter Smith.)

Carlos Correa is not The Wizard of Oz doing backflips as he takes his position. He is not Omar Vizquel making almost every difficult play seem routine collecting Gold Gloves at the rate Julia Louis-Dreyfus picks up Emmys. Correa is a defensive unicorn of another kind one who uses force and a rifle of an arm as much as the agility of a much smaller man.

There is no doubting that Correa is having a big season to remember though one that belongs up there with the defensive best of Ozzie Smith and Vizquel. The Houston Astros free agent shortstop to be is an athletic thinking man’s comet of a defensive force. Correa is at it again in the Astros’ 4-1 win over their helpless intrastate foe the Texas Rangers Saturday night.

The Rangers end the night with two hits and an 11th straight loss — in no small part due to Correa’s new school wizardry. He makes three impressive defensive plays in a two inning span at one point pushing the Astros to 60 wins (the San Francisco Giants are the only team in the Majors with more) as surely as Framber Valdez and Yordan Alvarez.

Sure Valdez somehow puts up six hitless innings while issuing six walks and being anything but his best. And Alvarez hits his 18th home run off a 97 MPH fastball and drives in half of Houston’s four runs. But Correa delivers the dazzle. On defense. Yes he also commits an uncharacteristic error in the seventh inning but by then the Rangers have long since been subdued.

Joey Gallo comes to the plate in the ninth inning with a runner on against Astros closer Ryan Pressly. But Gallo represents the chance for the slightest bit of drama more than real hope. And promptly strikes out looking without a complaint.

“When I looked up there and I saw it was a no hitter I can’t believe it because of the amount of walks that were out there” Astros manager Dusty Baker says of a weird but Astros satisfying night.

Correa seems to put on a defensive show every other night a twisting turning forceful acrobatic reminder of all the Astros get from him in that side of the game. In the top of the fifth inning against Texas he pulls off back-to-back sparkling plays. He ranges far to his left to reach a bouncing baseball and guns Charlie Culberson out at first. And follows that by making a hard stop of a Jose Trevino grounder for another out.

Then in the sixth Correa shows off the power of his arm turning a slow chopper from Adolis Garcia into an out with the speed of his throw to first. There are Marvel superheroes who move at a slower rate than a full-speed Correa throw.

Carlos Correa does not get a big hit every night. Or many nights at all lately. But he’s great theater almost every game no matter what. He’s made defense a major part of the show. Correa gobbles up baseballs at the rate Pac-Man eats dots — and Astros pitchers like Framber Valdez benefit from it nightly.

“It means he’s a team guy” Astros manager Dusty Baker says of Correa’s nightly defense shows. “And he takes pride in defense. Hitting’s fun. Everybody loves to hit. But defense is work. You know what I mean.

“And at shortstop you can’t have any mental lapses because you’re in on almost every play.”

Correa sets the tone for this World Series hunting team as much as Jose Altuve does at this point. It’s about a standard that does not even allow the prospect of a no hitter to distract from the mission at hand.

“Actually I don’t think anybody really realized a no hitter was going on” Alvarez says. “Including myself. I didn’t really know until the seventh inning. We were all just focused on the game.”

When the chance at a no hitter does even distract you you know you’re locked in. Especially when the Rangers have already been no hit twice this season — and often seemed primed to make it a historic three.

Valdez who memorably benefitted from Carlos Correa’s counsel during the heat of a crucial American League Championship Series moment last October certainly does not seem impressed with himself for no hitting the Rangers for six innings while struggling with his control. The potential ace wears a Framchise T-shirt after the game that a company sent to him but it’s more of a fun gimmick than an attitude.

Valdez dismisses the idea of handing out Framchise shirts to his teammates. That’s not how these Astros roll. Instead it’s all about gobbling up wins. Together.

Astros Nirvana Rangers Misery

Texas’ two Major League Baseball teams could not be further apart in terms of outlook and attitude.

“We can’t feel sorry for ourselves” Rangers manager Chris Woodward says. Even though it’s hard to do anything but that. About the only good news for the Rangers this summer is the club’s drafting of Jack Leiter a potential future ace with serious MLB dad bonafides with the second overall pick.

Somehow these Rangers look further behind in their rebuild than when the season began. And the joy over the new ballpark — and it should be a genuine joy Globe Life Field is a fun place to watch a game — can only last so long.

Carlos Correa seems to put on a defensive show every other night a twisting turning forceful acrobatic reminder of all the Astros get from him in that side of the game.

These days Woodward often sounds like a guy who’s just trying to hang on as his ship sinks. “You’ve got to hold your head up high” the third-year manager tells Rangers beat writer Evan Grant. “I don’t care if you’re getting your butts kicked every night.”

The truth is you’d much rather have what the Detroit Tigers have than the Rangers. You can see hope with the Tigers. The Rangers have scored the fewest runs in the American League often giving themselves no chance of winning. On this night they manage one run. And it comes in the ninth inning.

It is never easy to score against the Astros. Not with Carlos Correa’s nightly magic show. There are all sorts of ways to win in baseball. Having one of the best defensive shortstops in the game is sure one nice way to start.

It’s something no one should take for granted. Unicorns don’t always stick around forever.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmloZWFydC5jb20vY29udGVudC8yMDIxLTA3LTI1LWhlbGxhLW1lZ2EtdG91ci1vcGVuZXItc2VlLXdlZXplci1mYWxsLW91dC1ib3ktYW5kLWdyZWVuLWRheXMtc2V0bGlzdHMv0gF3aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaWhlYXJ0LmNvbS9hbHRlcm5hdGUvYW1wLzIwMjEtMDctMjUtaGVsbGEtbWVnYS10b3VyLW9wZW5lci1zZWUtd2VlemVyLWZhbGwtb3V0LWJveS1hbmQtZ3JlZW4tZGF5cy1zZXRsaXN0cy8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hella Mega Tour Opener: See Weezer Fall Out Boy And Green Day's Setlists,"It's been almost two years since the Hella Mega Tour was initially announced and on Saturday night (July 24) Weezer Fall Out Boy and Green Day finally embarked on their epic stadium tour.

Fan-filmed video of the performance can be seen below.

Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons both tweeted out a short video of GREEN DAY's rendition and offered their praise for the Northern California band with Stanley writing: ""'Tonight In DALLAS!' Another reason to love @GreenDay!"" Simmons chimed in: """"@GreenDay In Houston [sic] yesterday! Thank you Gentlemen."" The official KISS Twitter account also shared the clip and added the message: ""@GreenDay 'Rock And Roll All Nite' tonight in Dallas. SO Cool! #KISSisEverywhere!""

GREEN DAY is an American punk rock band composed of vocalist/guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong bassist Mike Dirnt and drummer Tré Cool. Formed in 1986 GREEN DAY was originally part of the punk scene at the DIY 924 Gilman Street club in Berkeley California. The band's early releases were with the independent record label Lookout! Records. In 1994 its major label debut ""Dookie"" (released through Reprise Records) became a breakout success and eventually sold over 10 million copies in the United States.

GREEN DAY was widely credited with popularizing and reviving mainstream interest in punk rock in the United States. Follow-up albums ""Insomniac"" (1995) and ""Nimrod"" (1997) each sold over two million albums and were certified double platinum and ""Warning"" (2000) was certified platinum. 2004 brought the band's rock opera ""American Idiot"" which reignited the band's popularity with a younger generation and sold over six million copies in the United States.

GREEN DAY is one of the world's best-selling bands of all time having sold more than 75 million records worldwide. The group has won five Grammy Awards: ""Best Alternative Album"" for ""Dookie"" ""Best Rock Album"" for ""American Idiot"" ""Record Of The Year"" for ""Boulevard Of Broken Dreams"" ""Best Rock Album"" for the second time for ""21st Century Breakdown"" and ""Best Musical Show Album"" for ""American Idiot: The Original Broadway Cast Recording"". In 2010 a stage adaptation of ""American Idiot"" debuted on Broadway. On April 18 2015 the band was inducted into the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame as a part of the 2015 class in what was their first year of eligibility for induction. On October 16 2015 GREEN DAY released the documentary ""Heart Like A Hand Grenade"" an unprecedented behind-the-scenes look at the writing and recording of ""American Idiot"". GREEN DAY's 12th studio album ""Revolution Radio"" was released on October 7 2016 and debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart. GREEN DAY released its 13th studio album ""Father of All Motherfuckers"" last year via Reprise/Warner Records. It debuted at No. 1 on the U.K. albums chart while also hitting No. 1 on the Billboard Top Rock Albums and No. 4 on the Billboard 200 resulting in the band’s 11th U.S. Top 10 album.

The group is led by Stephen M. Kincade and Alexander S. Fridell and had overseen $1.45 billion in client assets according to a person familiar with their practice. The team also includes Stephen’s son Chris who is a junior advisor and client associates Zach Kingsley Jessica McEntee and Elle Schiowitz.

They had been well-known at Merrill’s private wealth group which includes around 200 teams serving ultra-wealthy customers for the size of their practice and also their well-heeled customers. Their client roster includes notables such as hedge fund manager Leon Cooperman according to a second source close to their practice.

Reached at his new UBS office Kincade who started his career at Goldman Sachs in 1985 declined to comm_ent on the move and also declined to comment or confirm any potential customers. He and Fridell had joined Merrill in 2012 from Barclays Capital in New York according to BrokerCheck.

A spokesperson for UBS declined to comment and a spokesperson for Merrill Lynch did not return a request for comment.

Merrill Wealth head Andy Sieg last week identified “competitive attrition” as an issue that required attention from the firm’s leadership. Losses of experienced brokers rose to around 5% annualized in the second quarter after running at around 4% in recent years a spokesman confirmed.

The company since 2019 has not disclosed the number of core brokers in its wealth business. Total headcount of advisors at Bank of America including thousands of private bankers and consumer-bank based brokers fell 2.1% in the second quarter and 5.9% year-over-year to 19385 the company said last week.

Recruiters have said that anecdotally departures of a number of high profile teams have been steady in recent years. Kincade and his team had worked on the same floor at One Bryant Park also known as Bank of America Tower as a $7-million prive wealth group led by Louis Meltzer Jacob M. Dunn and Hadi Fakhoury who left last September to join Morgan Stanley Wealth Management.

Kincade and his group had evaluated other firms including Morgan Stanley but opted for UBS because it was a better fit for their relatively transactional practice which had a focus on syndicate business the second source said.

UBS has also shown a willingness to open its wallet to compete with high-end offers from Morgan Stanley and other aggressive recruiters for some high-end teams recruiters have said.

Kincade also worked at Grigsby Brandford & Co. and Lehman Brothers before joining Barclays in 2009 according to his BrokerCheck. Fridell started at Citigroup’s Smith Barney in 2007 shifted to Lehman Brothers the following year and worked at Morgan Stanley for a stint before joining Barclays in 2009.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXJrZXR3YXRjaC5jb20vc3RvcnkvZmFjaW5nLWFudGl0cnVzdC1idWxscy1leWUtZ29vZ2xlLXN0b2NrLXN0aWxsLWF0LXJlY29yZC1oaWdocy1iZWNhdXNlLWFkLXNhbGVzLWFyZS1zaXp6bGluZy0xMTYyNzA1Nzk0NNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Facing antitrust bull's-eye Google stock still at record highs because ad sales are sizzling,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.marketwatch.com/story/facing-antitrust-bulls-eye-google-stock-still-at-record-highs-because-ad-sales-are-sizzling-11627057944 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXJrZXR3YXRjaC5jb20vc3RvcnkvZmFjaW5nLWFudGl0cnVzdC1idWxscy1leWUtZ29vZ2xlLXN0b2NrLXN0aWxsLWF0LXJlY29yZC1oaWdocy1iZWNhdXNlLWFkLXNhbGVzLWFyZS1zaXp6bGluZy0xMTYyNzA1Nzk0NNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9kYXlzLWxpdmVzLXN0YXItY2Fyc29uLWJvYXRtYW4tMTUwNDUwMDA1Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Days of Our Lives Star Carson Boatman Weds Model Julana Dizon: 'We Couldn't Be Happier',"Jennifer Weinman Photography Carson Boatman and Julana Dizon

Days of Our Lives actor Carson Boatman is officially a married man.

Boatman 27 wed model Julana Dizon on Friday July 23 at a ceremony in Des Moines Iowa near where he grew up.

""We're ecstatic"" Boatman tells PEOPLE exclusively of his nuptials. ""We couldn't be happier. It's been a long year and so we're excited to kind of get it behind us and top it off with us tying the knot.""

You can see the soap opera actor portray an aged Johnny DiMera on Days starting this August.

The happy couple first met in 2016 in Los Angeles when their mutual gym trainer played ""matchmaker"" and set them up for a dinner date. ""And the rest is history"" Boatman says.

""It came a lot sooner than I expected so I was really surprised"" Dizon recalls of the romantic proposal.

At Friday's ceremony Boatman and Dizon made a point to also include their pets with one of their dogs serving as the ring bearer and the other as a flower girl.

""It's kind of a whole little bit"" Boatman explains. ""The pastor is going to go to my brother who's my best man for the rings. And then my brother's going to say 'Oh no. I don't have the rings. I don't know where the rings are.' And then the pastor's going to go 'Does anybody have the rings?'""

He continues ""And then this AC/DC song is going to come on and the suspense will build for a few seconds and then these sliding barn doors will open and Willie our dog is going to run down the aisle to me with the rings and then we'll leash him up and he'll sit there with us for the rest of the ceremony.""

Aside from the theatrical moment at their ceremony Boatman and Dizon add that their reception had a ""very summery"" feel with a touch of country western with Dizon and her bridesmaids all donning cowboy boots.

As for what they're looking forward to now that they have tied the knot the newlyweds say they can't wait to simply experience life together.

ST. LOUIS — Determined.

In a word that’s Cooper Scharff a rising senior at St. Louis University High School.

Cooper started swimming competitively at 5 years old.

“When I first got into swimming I was watching the 2008 Olympics” Scharff said. “And I was watching Michael Phelps swimming a lot and he was my idol. After I saw him I was like ‘I really want to do that.’”

Scharff joined the Flyer Aquatic Swim Team commonly known as F.A.S.T. when he was 13 years old. F.A.S.T. is a USA Swimming club team in the St. Louis area.

He quickly moved up the ladder and worked with Saint Louis University head swimming coach and F.A.S.T. national group coach Jim Halliburton.

Halliburton has coached two world-record holders and is one of only a few individuals who have coached at least one qualifier at each of the last 10 USA Olympic Trials.

He has coached more than 100 Missouri high school state champions and more than 50 swimmers who have been ranked in the top 16 in the United States in their age group.

He was the perfect match for Scharff’s style and talent level.

“I was excited” Halliburton said. “This was a really tall good swimmer’s body. I thought a really talented swimmer.”

Scharff became nationally ranked one year after joining Halliburton’s team.

In March at just 17 years old Scharff missed the Olympic Trials cutoff by four-tenths of a second in the 50m freestyle.

“I’ve had swimmers at each of the last 10 Olympic Trials” Halliburton said. “I’m thinking Cooper for sure could be there next time.”

“I guess my end goal would be to make it to the Olympics” Scharff said. “Olympic Trials at least. Olympic Trials Finals. But you know I still have a while ahead of me so it’s tough to see that far in the future but hopefully it’s where it can lead.”

Halliburton added that Scharff reminds him of one of his former swimmers Vianney High School graduate Nick Alexander.

Alexander swam in the 2018 U.S. Swimming National Championships placing eighth in the 200m backstroke.

The difference is that Halliburton believes Scharff is only scratching the surface.

Scharff gets for more years to train for the chance to reach the Olympic Trials. He will do it with one mentality that led him to this point in his career and may just get him to his dream.

“Being competitive and not wanting to lose” Halliburton said. “His 100 meter back that he just won in Kansas; he was second or third at the 50 and you could just tell he was determined to win. So he’s getting better and I expect big things from him.”

On July 2 Scharff verbally committed to swim at the University of Wisconsin in fall 2022.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vcGV0YXBpeGVsLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA3LzI1L2dyZWF0LXJlYWRzLWluLXBob3RvZ3JhcGh5LWp1bHktMjUtMjAyMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Great Reads in Photography: July 25 2021,"Every Sunday we bring together a collection of easy-reading articles from analytical to how-to to photo-features in no particular order that did not make our regular daily coverage.

A Lost Camera Case Opens Memories of a 1960s Photojournalist’s Life – The Daily Beast

Actress and author Kathryn Leigh Scott’s deceased former husband was Ben Martin a Time/Life photographer. According to the New York Times he captured “evocative images that defined the 1960s” in the United States.

The discovery of an old lost Zero Halliburton camera case brought back memories of Martin’s famous photographs and his photojournalistic career.

“Besides I knew the stories behind the pictures” writes Scott. “One of Ben’s first big assignments was covering the Nixon/Kennedy presidential debates in 1960. When Ben’s photograph of Richard Nixon with his sweaty 5 o’clock shadow was published in Time Nixon claimed it cost him the election. When Ben photographed him years later Nixon showed up with an electric razor in hand saying ‘You’re not going to get me twice.’

“Wearing cotton gloves and poring over a lightbox I’ve come across unexpected images with a shock of recognition” writes Scott.

“I’ve had my own time to revisit history with these precious images including my life with Ben. Fifty-odd years later the photographs are a poignant reminder of the man I loved married and seldom saw.”

Phil Mistry: What memories do these photos of famous people bring back?

Kathryn Leigh Scott: Ben and I were living together when he was assigned many of these Time/Life cover stories including the funeral of John F. Kennedy Martin Luther King’s Selma march the Angolan War Hiroshima Revisited and “Swinging London” to name a few. ALL photojournalists are great storytellers and I treasure his behind-the-scenes accounts. Thank God I got him to write many of them down!

PM: These are financially valuable images and would you auction them at Christie’s or donate them to a research institute?

KLS: About 2300 of Ben’s photographs are available through Getty Images and I have a number of signed prints available through a gallery. The negatives contact sheets and ephemera from his long career have been donated to The Briscoe Center at the University of Texas Austin to join the archives of so many of Ben’s photojournalist colleagues. I’m so pleased these valuable historical images will be preserved for future generations.

PM: Would you keep a few prints to put up on your living room wall?

KLS: I have quite a few of Ben’s vintage prints on my wall: Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn composing; Thelonious Monk and the Baroness Nica de Koenigswarter romancing after hours at the Five Spot in Greenwich Village; Harper Lee a friend of Ben’s photographed in her New York apartment shortly after the publication of “To Kill A Mockingbird and Maria Callas in rehearsals for “Tosca” among others.

PM: Any other thoughts?

KLS: I hope the very intimate piece I wrote about Ben will promote interest in preserving the archives of photojournalists particularly those from the pre-digital golden years when a photographer had to be there up close and personal to get the shot.

Notable: Ben Martin was mentored by photographer W. Eugene Smith famous for the Minamata mercury poisoning story. According to The New York Times “His photo essay in The Columbus Dispatch about a traveling preacher caught the eye of a Life magazine picture editor who offered him a job but the position was eliminated a week before he arrived in New York. Instead he accepted a position as a copy boy at Time.”

Which Camera Brand is Most Popular at the Tokyo Olympics? – Phil Mistry

Long long ago (you can guess) people would count the long lenses whether they were white lenses or black lenses indicating which camera system was popular. Today it is not so easy. Let us know in the comments below which camera system you think is most popular?

A Photographer Travels to the Tokyo Olympics – SwimSwam

Jack Spitser is a San Diego-based photographer who swam for UC San Diego under Olympic coach David Marsh.

In his blog he recounts the arduous journey to Japan to photograph the swimming events through a “full day of 24 sleepless hours including 8 hours in the Tokyo Narita airport.” Numerous paperwork overly expensive COVID tests and 14-day activity plans were only some of the requirements needed to get into Tokyo.

Overuse of Camera Filters Linked to a Serious Mental Health Issue – NBC10 WJAR

“I think with media it’s always been the case that we’ve been affected by images whether it’s been celebrities or you know models” says Dr. Rachel Simmons a psychologist at Lifespan Physician Group to 10 WJAR.

“I think it becomes a problem when people are spending a lot of time taking selfies editing selfies posting them.

“This [Body Dysmorphic Disorder or BDD which affects one in 50 people] is a condition where people already often are thinking you know for hours a day they’re thinking about perceived flaws in their appearance and they feel really ugly or unattractive.”

Photographer Catherine Opie on Creating Living History and Leading UCLA’s Art Department — KCRW

Catherine Opie’s friends call her the mayor of LA because she’s photographed so much of the area over the decades from freeway overpasses rundown mini-malls and empty cityscapes and of people like high school football players California surfers and those in the Lesbian leather scene.

She has just been named chair of the Art Department at UCLA where she has taught for the last 20 years.

And a new book courtesy of Phaidon titled Catherine Opie is out featuring more than 300 of Opie’s photographs from the past 40 years.

During the pandemic Opie spent six weeks traveling in an RV to photograph life nationwide. In Virginia she visited the monument of Confederate General Robert E. Lee on a horse. The image shows the structure’s graffitied base.

Opie tells KCRW “I believe the graffiti on that site … in relationship to an activist moment within Black Lives Matter after the killing of George Floyd was a real interesting moment where we are reckoning again with the history of slavery and Black lives literally being killed by the hands of police one after another. I look at that not as defacement of a monument but a reclaiming of no longer celebrating this figure of Robert E. Lee.”

How to Make a Genuinely Inclusive Phone Camera — Wired

Creator and model Lesley Buckle has experienced issues with skin color balancing on both sides of the camera.

“As someone who spends a lot of time shooting professionally I find my medium skin tone never looks quite right” she tells Wired. “It’s often too orange too pink too light and there’s not enough detail. Something always seems off or feels flat. To try and correct for this I often have to use more powerful lighting but then whole details of my face can be completely blown out and flat.”

The Best of Latin American Photojournalism – in Pictures – The Guardian

The 4th annual Latin American Foto festival at the Bronx Documentary Center in New York features long-term projects that highlight social issues across the region. The festival covers organized crime food insecurity and social cleansing and hosts a range of activities encouraging community participation running until 1 August

The festival reflects a historically difficult year for the region as seen through the eyes of the photographers who lived it. It also highlights the strength resilience and innovation of inhabitants throughout Latin America.

Rather than hold an indoor exhibition BDC will be taking the photos out to the community and displaying them as large-scale works on banners and in projections throughout the neighborhood.

David Bowie’s Lost Portraits from the Photoshoot for his 1969 Album Have Been Re-discovered – Hemel Today

Photographer Vernon Dewhurst from Berkhamsted (26 miles NW of London UK) was excited to see the original transparencies of his iconic David Bowie shoot for the Space Oddity Record sleeve. Dewhurst who once lived with the music legend in London between 1968 and 1969 has been trying to find the original transparencies forever.

“But recently I located them with Isolar David’s estate people in New York” Dewhurst tells Hemel Today.

“They very kindly agreed to supply me with hi-res files of the whole shoot some 26 images unseen and unpublished except for the one used for original record sleeve in 1969.

“You can imagine how excited I felt looking at the pictures unseen for 52 years! They show in fantastic quality and detail a very young David no make-up no Photoshop or retouching just as I remember him.”

New Study Sheds Light on What Instagram Reveals About a Couple’s Relationship — PsyPost

According to new research published in the Journal of Social and Personal Relationships people’s relationship tends to be more visible on Instagram when they and their partner have higher relationship satisfaction investment and commitment.

The researchers found a positive association between relationship quality and Instagram engagement. People who were more satisfied with their relationship were more likely to include or reference their partner in their Instagram posts. They were also more likely to like and comment on their partner’s Instagram posts.

PPI vs. DPI: What’s the Difference and Why It Matters to Photographers – SLR Lounge

A lot of photographers ask “what PPI should I save my images at?” The answer says Matthew Saville is this: As long as the total number of pixels itself doesn’t change the PPI of an image is mostly just an arbitrary number until you decide to actually print the image out. That’s when you need to worry about how many pixels are available to print per inch!

The Chair of the 2021 World Press Photo Contest Jury Shares Eight of her Favorite Nominated Photos and Stories — Witness

NayanTara Gurung Kakshapati is the co-founder and festival director of Photo Kathmandu an international festival in the capital of Nepal Kathmandu every two years.

As the World Press Photo Foundation announced the nominees for the 2021 Photo Contest on 10 March Witness magazine asked NayanTara to select her favorite images that didn’t make it for the World Press Photo of the Year or World Press Photo Story of the Year nominees.

One of the photos (above) she picked was by Nadia Buzhan showing Olga Sieviaryniec waiting for her husband Paval outside a detention center in Minsk Belarus on 22 July 2020. Paval Sieviaryniec who had been collecting signatures in support of candidates to stand against President Alexander Lukashenko had been held on remand since 7 June and his family had learned he was about to be released. Olga waited outside the prison for two hours but Paval was not freed.

Kakshapati’s take on the photo (above) as told to Witness:

“This pensive photograph was presented to us in the Spot News category and has lingered on my mind perhaps because of how unnervingly silent and still it is. This frame from Minsk reminds me of how authoritarianism and the crackdown on civil society and media are also raging here at home in Nepal Myanmar Bangladesh India and the rest of the world. In its own quiet way the photograph marks the convictions of so many activists journalists students artists bloggers comedians and human rights defenders who continue to speak truth to power despite brutal suppression and incarceration.”

Check out her incisive comments on seven other photos.

Why I Like This Photo — Dean McLeod

I like this photo because it reminds me of my home province of Saskatchewan Canada where summer thunderstorms often result in dramatic skies like this vivid rainbow which are exciting to chase and photograph.

The science of how rainbows occur is helpful to understand as a landscape photographer so you can predict if and where they may appear. This will improve your chances of being in the right place at the right time to capture one with your camera.

Generally two main conditions have the potential to produce rainbows. The first is having the sun clearly visible unobstructed by clouds and low in the sky such as an hour or less before sunset. The second is having precipitation in the atmosphere in the opposite direction of the sun (such as a rainstorm moving from west to east that passes overhead in the evening). The sunlight refracts off of the water droplets in the air creating what we see as a rainbow when we stand with our back to the sun.

This image from the summer of 2020 was captured shortly after a rainstorm during an evening drive in the countryside. The strong winds pushed the dark clouds to the east while the sky cleared in the west about 45 minutes before sunset. The sun was bright and I knew there was a strong chance I may see a rainbow so I pulled onto a gravel road to search for a foreground subject.

Luckily I found this rustic old barn sitting alone in a farmer’s field so I pulled over set my camera on the tripod and waited. Almost on cue a rainbow began to form against the dark eastern sky. The only problem was that the rainbow appeared to “touch” the horizon very close to the position of the barn and the composition didn’t balance well.

Knowing that the position of a rainbow in the sky is directly related to your line of sight with the sun behind you it is easy to adjust the perceived “position” of the rainbow to improve your composition by simply moving your body. My composition would be more balanced if the bottom arc of the rainbow touched the horizon further to the left of the barn so the solution was simple; I picked up my tripod and ran to the left a few yards watching its position as I moved.

Finally using a circular polarizer on your lens is critical to pull out all of the vivid colors when shooting rainbows. For this photo I used a Nikkor 24-70 f2.8 lens with a polarizer at 28mm on a Nikon D850 f/8 1/15th of a second at ISO 31 for the cleanest master file possible with no digital noise. I couldn’t have been happier with the results.

So the next time a rainstorm passes by before sunset get your back to the sun and enjoy the hunt for a beautiful rainbow!

Dean McLeod is a Canadian landscape and nature photographer specializing in gallery-quality acrylic and metal fine art photography prints. Born and raised in the prairie province of Saskatchewan where he still resides today his wonderment of the natural world began at a very young age. “There’s nothing like witnessing a burning sunrise or gazing up at the stars with fresh air in your lungs to help de-stress and reconnect with this amazing planet that we call home” says McLeod.

By Ronni Newton

The sprinkler system was able to control the impact of an overnight fire at Sedgwick Middle School and West Hartford Fire Department crews completed the task of extinguishing the blaze officials said Saturday.

A fire alarm was triggered and the first units responded to Sedgwick right around midnight Saturday the battalion chief said.

Crews found “the sprinkler system activated with light smoke in the school” he said.

The fire was traced to the wood shop where the sprinkler system had been activated and successfully kept the blaze under control.

Units extinguished the remaining fire and ventilated the building the battalion chief said.

There were no injuries and the scene was cleared at 2 a.m.

The cause of the fire is under investigation by the Fire Marshal’s Office.

First-time gun buyers are a big reason why.,"Gun sales are spiking in Connecticut and around the nation a buying spree driven by fears of rising crime a political shift in Washington and the social upheaval brought on by the pandemic.

“People are jumping at the opportunity to buy more guns” said Rob Pizzi Jr. owner of Central Connecticut Arms in Portland one of the state’s largest gun shops.

Preliminary numbers provided by the Connecticut State Police show 169113 gun sale authorizations in 2020 up from 126458 in 2019 — an increase more than 33%. So far this year sales are continuing to increase as the state has received 94534 authorizations which must be filled out before the sale or transfer of any firearm.

First-time gun buyers are a big part of the surge: The state has issued 31170 new gun permits from Jan. 1 through early July according to the preliminary data. That’s more than double the number of permits processed in all of 2019.

That’s true across the country as well: A survey of firearms retailers conducted by the National Shooting Sports Foundation an industry group based in Newtown found that 40% of customers from January through April of 2020 were first-time gun buyers. And 40% of those new buyers were female.

Rob Pizzi Jr. right owner of Central Connecticut arms talks with customer Frank Santoro of Southington about which firearm to purchase.

“The fastest growing demographic of new gun owners are women” said Holly Sullivan president of the Connecticut Citizens Defense League a nonprofit group that advocates on behalf of gun owners. “By and large the biggest growth is among women and that’s consistent nationally and here in the state.”

Jenny a 44-year-old stay-at-home mother bought her first gun last year. A victim of domestic abuse she said she was motivated by concerns about her personal safety. (The Courant does not identify survivors of domestic violence without their permission.)

“I had run into my ex-husband while I was jogging and after that I made the decision that I needed to carry” she said.

The uncertainty of life during the pandemic also played a role. “It was such an unpredictable time and people were under a lot of stress” she said. “I realized I was responsible for my own self-defense.”

Since buying her gun she has begun spending time at the gun range to work on her shooting skills and in the process she discovered a new hobby. “I just love going shooting” she said. “I have the confidence that I can hit my target.”

Pizzi said self-defense is the main reason his customers are buying guns. “People are starting to realize they’re their own first responders” he said. “With all the anti-police sentiment that’s going around right now we’re selling a lot of concealed-carry handguns. We sell a lot of home defense handguns and shotguns.”

Indeed fear of crime is driving an appetite for more guns Sullivan said. “Americans across the board whether they’re first-time gun owners or longtime gun owners feel more of a need to defend themselves and their families than they have in the past” she said. “That is the cultural climate the political climate and the reality that we’re in.”

Gun sales often increase after an election and 2020 was no different. Democrat Joe Biden’s pledge to address rising gun violence prompted some purchases Pizzi said.

“They’re worried about the political climate and what may or may not be available for them to purchase and what’s going to be illegal” Pizzi said.

Rob Pizzi Jr. left owner of Central Connecticut Arms said people are buying guns because they are worried about new restrictions that might be placed on firearms.

Gun violence prevention activists dispute that narrative. “People have an irrational fear that guns will somehow disappear overnight just like they thought would happen in the Obama administration” said Jeremy Stein executive director of CT Against Gun Violence an advocacy group.

“That didn’t happen then and it’s not going to happen now in the Biden administration. We are not going to see a repeal of the Second Amendment. A lot of this buying is fear-driven: fear of the pandemic fear of the unknown fear of this idea that somehow guns will not be available or ammunition will not be available.”

More guns do not enhance public safety Stein said. In fact he said research shows that the opposite is true.

“Guns lead to increased harms in homes increased incidence of gun crimes and increased incidents of accidental death suicide and domestic violence” Stein said. “What we anticipate is that this increase in gun sales will eventually lead to an increased rate of gun deaths because more guns lead to more gun deaths.”

Amid the accelerating sales the state police firearms registration system has been beset by delays. Last week the Connecticut Citizens Defense League filed a lawsuit over the long lag times in the process by which new buyers of guns and ammunition are fingerprinted and issued permits. (Without permits buyers cannot make purchases and licensed dealers cannot make sales.)

The group sued the state last year after Gov. Ned Lamont allowed state and local police to stop fingerprinting applicants for gun permits during the coronavirus pandemic a requirement for the issuance of permits. A federal judge said gun ownership is a fundamental right and ordered the police to resume fingerprinting but the gun rights group claiming that delays are continuing wants the court to revisit the issue.

Brian Foley a spokesman for the state Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection said the agency is implementing new software bringing on new staff and adding phone lines to expedite the process.

“We inherited a paper system. We’re moving to an electronic system” Foley said. “We understand the frustration with how long it was taking during the transitional period.”

The timing of the move to a new system happened to coincide with the dramatic increase in gun sales Foley said. “There was no way for us to predict there would be this radical of a surge in gun permits and transactions looking at previous years.”

Joe first appeared in 1964. The original idea was the brainchild of inventor Stan Weston who figured that boys could do with a masculine version of the popular Barbie doll which had proved a hit since landing on shelves in 1959. Manufacturer Hasbro who made the iconic Mr Potato Head were initially reluctant but eventually gave the go-ahead for Joe – although he couldn’t be a “doll” he had to be an “action figure”.

All that changed in 2021 – now Asian characters are leading this all-American franchise. This week sees the US release of Snake Eyes: G.I. Joe Origins with a cast dominated by actors of Asian backgrounds. Crazy Rich Asians star Henry Golding tops the bill as the eponymous Snake Eyes alongside the likes of Andrew Koji Japanese actors Haruka Abe and Takehiro Hira and Indonesian martial arts icon Iko Uwais. Quite the turn around.

Few Western pop culture icons are as all-American as the G.I. Joe team. The X-Men routinely featured members from around the world – Wolverine is Canadian by birth Storm has deep ties to Africa and Nightcrawler was born in Europe. Even The Avengers contained a multicultural albeit Caucasian edge with early members including non-Americans like Thor Hercules and Scarlet Witch (Wanda Maximoff). There was none of that for G.I. Joe though whose members were individually branded “A Real American Hero”.

Four figures were released on G.I. Joe’s debut one each for the army navy air force and marines. The figures were an instant hit accounting for two thirds of Hasbro’s sales in its first two years.

However as the US involvement in Vietnam escalated in the second half of the 1960s and casualties started to mount America’s fighting men were seen in a less favourable light. This new attitude was on display in 1966 when a group of mothers picketed the toy industry’s yearly trade convention in New York pushing the slogan “Toy Fair or Warfare?”

Unsurprisingly Hasbro was forced to tweak G.I. Joe’s persona. A gradual rebranding effort saw the action figure ditch his quintessential American accruements like the Ike jacket and US jeep. By the early 70s the soldiers had been moved off the front lines and transformed into less threatening “adventurers” more suited to rescue missions than bombing runs. It wasn’t enough to save G.I. Joe who was retired from duty in 1978.

But changes in circumstances swiftly brought G.I. Joe back. President Reagan’s election in 1980 and an intensification of the Cold War saw the franchise return at its most ultra-patriotic – the Real American Hero era.

Mirroring public sentiment G.I. Joe became one of the icons of kids’ popular culture in the 80s. Initial sales projections for the relaunched Joe figures were US$12-US$15 million but this proved way short of the mark as Hasbro sold over US$50 million worth of product instead. An estimated 125 different G.I. Joe figures were produced between 1982 and 1985 alone. Underscoring the very American nature of G.I. Joe were toys like the vast USS Flagg aircraft carrier a seven-feet six-inch vehicle that retailed for US$110 in the 80s. The franchise got its own Marvel comic series and a cartoon series starting in September 1985 that ran for nearly 100 episodes.

That Snake Eyes is dominated by a predominantly Asian cast is some turn around – albeit not one with certain precedents. In the franchise’s early years Hasbro added an African-American Joe and a “she-Joe” whose role was that of a nurse in an attempt to provide a touch of diversity to the original all-male all-Caucasian line-up. The figures’ later “kung fu grip” also added a touch of cosmopolitanism to the otherwise entirely Western aspects of G.I. Joe.

What prompted Paramount to roll the dice on its Asian cast in 2021 could well be simple box office maths. When the franchise was first rebooted for cinema with G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra (2009) it did modestly well earning just over US$300 million on a US$175 million budget. The sequel backed with American stars Dwayne Johnson and Channing Tatum did better business – US$375 million worldwide on a US$130 million budget – yet still paled in comparison to Paramount’s largest franchises Mission: Impossible and Transformers whose top instalments had grossed double that.

The success of Crazy Rich Asians (2018) starring Golding which became the highest-grossing romantic comedy of the preceding 10 years may have convinced executives that an Asian-led reboot could be a successful way to reinvigorate the franchise.

Having Iko Uwais on board should certainly bolster the film’s attractiveness for action fans. The Indonesian star’s two Raid films were instantly acclaimed as martial arts classics and Uwais has bolstered his profile in the West thanks to starring in the well-received Netflix show Wu Assassins.

The Covid-19 pandemic postponed the release of Snake Eyes by nearly 16 months. Here’s hoping the delay doesn’t further impact what could well be a breakout action film for Asian actors in Hollywood.

Night Shyamalan is scoring another No. 1 at the domestic box office where his thriller Old is slithering past fellow new offering Snake Eyes: G.I. Joe Origins to win an overall quiet weekend.

Old — about a family whose tropical vacation turns into an age-accelerating nightmare — took in $16.5 million from 3555 locations. The psychological thriller starring Gael García Bernal and Vicky Krieps was inspired by the graphic novel Sandcastle.

Old distributed by Universal debuted to $6.5 million internationally from 23 markets for a worldwide start of $23 million.

Paramount and Hasbro’s Snake Eyes: G.I. Joe Origins starring Henry Golding came in second with an estimated $13.4 million from 3521 locations. Overseas it debuted to $4 million from 37 markets for a global launch of $17.8 million.

In normal times Snake Eyes — which had hoped to relaunch an important franchise for Hasbro and Paramount — would have been expected to do far more business. It opened well behind the first two films in the franchise based on the Hasbro toy. G.I. Joe: Rise of Cobra debuted domestically to $54 million in 2009 while 2013’s G.I. Joe: Retaliation started with $40 million.

Snake Eyes‘ performance is no doubt a major disappointment for the filmmakers as the box office recovery continues to plod along. The movie — costing a reported $88 million to make before marketing — skewed heavily male (60 percent).

And while Old marks the seventh time that a Shyamalan movie has opened at No. 1 it is still the lowest nationwide start for the director-writer supplanting The Lady in the Water ($18 million). Old cost Shyamalan — who puts together the financing for his own films — a relatively modest $18 million to make before marketing.

The wild swings at the box office — as well as relatively low openings for many movies in comparison to the past — reflect that moviegoing has yet to reach pre-pandemic levels (both Old or Snake Eyes weren’t tracking to do huge numbers). And in recent days the Delta variant has further complicated matters.

Circumstances in a raft of foreign markets are even more challenging. Old grossed just $500000 from France where cinemas are now requiring vaccine passports. As a result box office revenue at the French box office tumbled 60 percent from last weekend. There are also cinema closures in Australia and heightened restrictions in Mexico.

Box office pundits are hopeful that next weekend’s Disney tentpole Jungle Cruise starring Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt will boost moviegoing followed by Marvel and DC’s Suicide Squad sequel in early August.

In North America Old and Snake Eyes claimed the top two spots on the box office chart ahead of Warner Bros.’ Space Jam: A New Legacy which — like many other event pics that are debuting simultaneously in the home — fell steeply in its second weekend.

The family movie is playing on HBO Max at no extra charge while Black Widow — now in its third weekend — is streaming on Disney+ Premier Access for an additional $30. (Black Widow fell 68 percent in its second weekend.)

Black Widow redeemed itself this weekend to some degree beating Space Jam 2 with $11.6 million and becoming the fastest film of the pandemic era to cross $150 million in North America. The stand-alone superhero film finished Sunday with a domestic tally of $154.8 million and $314.9 million globally including another $14.5 million offshore for the weekend. (The company did not reveal updated Disney+ Premier Access numbers.)

Space Jam 2 from Warner Bros. dropped 69 percent to $9.7 million for a 10-day domestic total of $51.4 million. The family pic earned $12.6 million overseas from 66 markets for a tepid foreign tally of $42.6 million and $94 million globally.

At the specialty box office Joe Bell starring Mark Wahlberg debuted to $707185 theaters the worst wide launch of Wahlberg’s career. Roadside Attractions is distributing the troubled film domestically.

Joe Bell was beat by Focus and CNN Films’ Roadrunner: A Film About Anthony Bourdain which earned $830000 in its second weekend from 954 theaters for a domestic tally of $3.7 million.

One bright spot: In a second win of the weekend for Universal F9 has become the first Hollywood event pic in the pandemic era to zoom past the $600 million mark at the worldwide box office. The tentpole received an exclusive theatrical release and was among the few Hollywood event films of late to get a release in China before the traditional summer blackout barring Western films kicked in.

Thanks to a tip from the Michigan Ghostbusters we now know an Amazon UK listing is live albeit currently not allowing pre-orders showcasing the four plushies and giving fans a much clearer look at the line.





As seen above the Ghostbusters Paranormal Plushies line from Hasbro will consist of Slimer the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man a Terror Dog and the newcomer to the franchise Muncher!

Check out the product description below.

GHOSTBUSTERS PARANORMAL PLUSHIES

What’s cuter and cuddlier than a ghost? A PLUSH ghost of course – the GHOSTBUSTERS Paranormal Plushies from Hasbro! This assortment of four plush toys includes ghosts from the original GHOSTBUSTERS movies and the new GHOSTBUSTERS: Afterlife film. Two ghost plushies have a shiny outer material to simulate ectoplasm and one other ghost plush even has a special noise when hugged. All four characters come with a clip and are soft huggable and lovable. Available at most major retailers nationwide.

No exact release is available for Ghostbusters Paranormal Plushies. Still with the Ghostbusters Fright Features and child roleplay accessories expected to hit store shelves on August 1st it’s safe to assume these won’t be too far behind.

Barbie died instantly and Enos died less than 24 hours later. Enos repeatedly called for Barbie and asked that she be brought to him.

Barbie’s cousin and her escort were traveling home with Barbie and Enos in a separate horse and buggy and they crossed the railroad tracks just before the train approached around a dangerous curve. The occupants in the first buggy witnessed this tragic accident. Enos’ horse sensed danger and reared up right on the tracks.

Barbie Hershey was born in June 1878 one of 12 children of Peter and Barbara Buckwalter Hershey. Losing Barbie was not the only loss of children that the Hersheys experienced.

Two of their children were born “silent” (stillborn) and in April 18 78 just two months before Barbie was born they lost two young girls to scarlet fever — Mary age 8 and Ellen 3. Two-year-old Martha survived scarlet fever but it left her frail and deaf in one ear. Pap Hershey picked out the name Barbara for Barbie naming her after her mother. Pap said Barbie brought sunshine back into the into Mam Hershey’s life after the loss of the girls to scarlet fever.

Unlike Martha Barbie grew up strong and healthy. She worked out in the fields of their large farm with her brothers and father. Barbie was the delight of the Hershey family. Their farm was located along Strasburg Road in Paradise Township near the Strasburg Rail Road.

Barbie had dated Enos but had broken up with him because he was several years older and more serious about marriage than Barbie. During this era Mennonite youth attended parties hosted by Mennonite families. The host family would mail out invitations matching up couples. Imagine Barbie’s chagrin when she picked up the mail at the post office and there was an invitation to a party at a farm in Witmer Station matching up Barbie and Enos.

Barbie thought she had a perfect alibi. She wanted to go to the rural New Holland area to help her oldest sister Sarah with a newborn. Mammy Hershey decided that she and Pap Hershey should go since Sarah had just delivered her seventh child. Mam thought more mature help was needed.

Mam and Pap left home to help Sarah and Barbie left home with Enos. The dilemma Barbie found herself in cost her her life. When the news of Barbie’s death reached Pap and Mam Hershey Mam became so hysterical the doctor thought she might die.

Although the railroad company never acknowledged fault they offered a monetary settlement to help with the funerals etc. Pap Hershey always declined saying he “would not accept money for his child’s blood.” Finally the railroad sent an older man from Philadelphia. When they emerged from the parlor in the large farmhouse everyone knew they had reached a settlement. Pap Hershey accepted free passes for a train trip to Niagara Falls for Pap Mam and Martha.

Enos’ family suffered a great loss that year too. Less than five weeks after Enos died his sister Ella May Barge age 12 died of an “inflammation of the bowels.”

After Enos and Barbie died these Mennonites removed themselves further from the “things of this world” regarding dress and social events. They hosted fewer social parties and encouraged their children to become involved in volunteering in mission projects.

The author lives in rural New Holland with her husband Will. Will is a great-grandson of Sarah Lucinda Hershey Eby oldest sister of Barbie Hershey. More about the story can be found in a 1984 novel titled “I Hear the Reaper’s Song” written by Sara Stambaugh — a granddaughter of Barbie Hershey’s brother Silas Hershey.

HLT,Hilton Worldwide,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjbXAuY29tL21hZ2F6aW5lcy9zdHlsZS9jZWxlYnJpdHkvYXJ0aWNsZS8zMTQyMjY1L3dob3MtcmljaGVzdC1oaWx0b24tcGFyaXMtdXMzMDAtbWlsbGlvbi1lbXBpcmUtYW5kLW5pY2t5c9IBeGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnNjbXAuY29tL21hZ2F6aW5lcy9zdHlsZS9jZWxlYnJpdHkvYXJ0aWNsZS8zMTQyMjY1L3dob3MtcmljaGVzdC1oaWx0b24tcGFyaXMtdXMzMDAtbWlsbGlvbi1lbXBpcmUtYW5kLW5pY2t5cw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Who’s the richest Hilton? The hotel family’s net worths – ranked,"The story behind their wealth is as fascinating as the people themselves. Barron Hilton Paris and Nicky’s uber-rich grandfather was chairman of the board and president and CEO of the company and in 2007 sold Hilton Hotels to the Blackstone Group for US$26 billion.

Whether it’s the famous Hilton hotel brand the OG influencer and reality star-turned-businesswoman Paris Hilton or Kyle and co on The Real Housewives it’s hard to escape the influence and magnitude of the Hilton family empire. Let’s not forget even Kim Kardashian started off as Paris’ assistant.

However when he passed away in 2019 he left most of his fortune to charity. In fact he left just 3 per cent of his wealth to his eight children 15 grandchildren and four great-grandchildren – including Paris Nicky and co.

The other 97 per cent went to the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation honouring his father’s wishes taking the family charity’s endowment from US$2.9 billion to US$6.3 billion.

So with the bulk of the Hilton family fortune out of the picture who is left with what and who earned their own empires? Here’s how rich the Hiltons (and Richards siblings) really are ...

Rick 65 and Kathy Hilton 62

Estimated net worth: US$350 million

As the parents of Paris Hilton close friends of former US president Donald Trump and even Michael Jackson  Rick and Kathy Hilton are the stalwarts of the Hilton family empire.

And they’ve got the bank balance to prove it. According to Celebrity Net Worth Rick and Kathy’s combined net worth is an estimated US$350 million making Kathy by far the richest cast member to ever appear on The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.

They may have missed out on the Hilton family billions but the couple certainly aren’t crying over spilled milk. These days Rick is the chairman and co-founder of Hilton & Hyland a real estate brokerage firm based in Beverly Hills. Kathy on the other hand is the ultimate Hilton housewife. As a former actress she now focuses on philanthropy sleeping in and living her best life (RHOBH viewers will know exactly what we’re talking about).

While Rick has always preferred to remain out of the spotlight Kathy’s recent appearance on RHOBH has given us a rare insight into their OTT and somewhat kooky luxury lives. And we can’t get enough of it.

Paris Hilton 40

Estimated net worth: US$300 million

Paris Hilton. Photo: @parishilton/Instagram

Love her or hate her one thing is for sure – Paris Hilton’s “dumb blonde” party girl image initially duped us all. As of 2021 Paris’ net worth is estimated to be US$300 million which means she’s fast catching up to her wealthy parents.

A big chunk of her income comes from her various retail businesses which include over 50 stores and 19 product lines internationally that have generated over US$4 billion in sales.

And while she’s definitely calmed down a lot since her mid-noughties antics alongside the likes of Britney Spears and Lindsay Lohan Paris is still a party girl at heart. The only difference is she gets paid a lot more these days. Since debuting as a DJ almost a decade ago she has been paid up to US$1 million for a single DJ set and in 2014 she earned an impressive US$2.7 million for four nights’ work during her residency in Ibiza.

Paris turned “famous for nothing” into an art and she’s still laughing all the way to the bank.

Kyle Richards 52

Estimated net worth: US$100 million

She may not be a fully fledged Hilton but as Kathy’s half sister with an impressive net worth of around USD$100 million (combined with her husband) Kyle certainly deserves her spot on this list.

Ever since she joined The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills in 2010 Kyle’s net worth has increased significantly. It’s no wonder she’s the last original cast member on the show still raking in the big bucks.

Kyle Richards and family. Photo: @kylerichards18/Instagram

Of course Richards’ husband Mauricio Umansky is a successful property agent which doesn’t hurt. Mauricio has been involved with high profile properties including the Playboy Mansion and Walt Disney estate through his own real estate firm The Agency. He previously sold extravagant properties to mega celebrities like Michael Jackson and Prince back in the day.

Nicky Hilton Rothschild 37

Estimated net worth: US$50 million

Paris’ sister Nicky is a successful fashion designer model author and mum of two and she’s worked just as hard as her big sis. She’s done everything from fashion and cosmetics lines to jewellery and bags earning her an impressive US$50 million on her own.

James Rothschild and Nicky Hilton Rothschild. Photo: @nickyhilton/Instagram

But there’s a twist: Nicky is probably the wealthiest Hilton richer than all of them combined. Or at least she eventually will be as the wife of James Rothschild from the uber-rich Rothschild dynasty – a London banking family. The Rothschild family had the largest private fortune in the world in the 19th century as well as throughout history at the time.

As of 2021 the net worth of James Rothschild is estimated at around US$1.5 billion. So let’s be honest – Nicky really doesn’t need to hustle any more. At all. Ever.

Barron Hilton II 31

Estimated net worth: US$5 million

Barron Hilton II. Photo: @barronhilton/Instagram

Living in the shadow of your ultra-famous sisters can’t be easy for a young guy growing up but it seems Barron Nicholas Hilton II is perfectly happy keeping things low key.

Of course being a handsome young Hilton he models. He is often seen doing print ads and walking the runway. In 2015 he made a short horror film called En Passant and he also started a foodie account on Instagram called Barron’s Bites.

Barron who is now worth around US$5 million married German countess Tessa Gräfin von Walderdorff in 2018 and they welcomed their daughter Milou Alizée in March 2020.

Kim Richards 56

Estimated net worth: USD$500000

Kim Richards. Photo: @kimrichards11/Instagram

Kathy and Kyle may be rolling in cash but their other sister Kim is only worth US$500000 according to Celebrity Net Worth.

Kim was a successful actress throughout the 70s and 80s and appeared on the first five seasons of RHOBH but in recent years it’s her troubled personal life that has made headlines (and drained her bank account).

In 2015 Richards was famously arrested and charged with trespassing public intoxication resisting an officer and battery on a police officer at the iconic Beverly Hills Hotel. A few months later she was caught allegedly shoplifting at a Target department store and paid a second visit to jail for the year.

Conrad Hilton III 27

Estimated net worth: unknown

Not much is known about the youngest Hilton sibling except for some troublesome headlines over the years and he is widely believed to be unemployed.

Last year Conrad was sentenced to prison for using drugs violating his parole stemming from a 2015 arrest for causing a disturbance on a flight from London to Los Angeles (he proceeded to threaten cabin crew and called fellow passengers “peasants” – ouch).

Let’s hope he can get back on track so he can start raking in big bucks like the rest of his family. Or just stay healthy and out of trouble at least.

Hilton calls the employee discounts “Go Hilton Team Member” and the rates are really low when available Friends & Family “Go Hilton Family Friends Rate” and “Go Hilton Extra FFTP.”

READ MORE: Hilton Honors Rate & Bonus Points Offer

Both Hilton Team Member and Friends & Family rates are eligible rates under the Honors program. You earn elite qualifying nights you earn all the usual base and promotional points + get to enjoy elite benefits too if you are at the Silver Gold or Diamond tier.

Hilton Team Member Rates

The standard employee rates are very low and each team member is eligible to book 30 nights of them every calendar year:

$35 USD for Hampton Hilton Garden Inn Homewood Suites Home2 Suites and Tru by Hilton

$45 USD for Hilton Hotels & Resorts DoubleTree Embassy Suites and Tapestry

$55 USD for Curio Canopy and Hilton Grand Vacations

$75 USD for Waldorf Astoria and Conrad

Team member rates include breakfast for two outside of the Americas + a 50% discount on F&B expenses globally. In addition employees don’t need to pay any resort or destination fees but amenities covered by those charges must be made available to them.

Team members who work a minimum of 20 years are eligible for these rates for the rest of their lives but cannot offer their Friends & Family benefits after leaving Hilton. Those that have worked 10 to 20 years are eligible for the Friends & Family rates for themselves after exiting.

Team members can book a maximum of two rooms under the Team Member and two under the Friends & Family rates for a maximum 7 nights continuous stay or two rooms first under the Team Member rate for the first 7 nights and then another 7 nights under the Friends & Family for up to 14 nights total.

Hilton Team member nights available yearly:

30 nights yearly under TEAM MEMBER-rates

70 nights yearly under Friends & Family-rates

EXTRA-designated TEAM MEMBER and Friends & Family rates don’t count towards these caps.

Hilton Friends & Family Rates

Here it gets more interesting to LoyaltyLobby readers who may have Friends & Family members working for Hilton like I now do (a friend who previously worked for Marriott and Accor recently joined a Hilton hotel at a managerial level).

Each team member can add Friends & Family members to their Lobby (yes – Hilton does call it a Lobby) account who in turn can then log into the Go-website using their usual Honors credentials and make the F&F bookings by themselves.

Friends and Family who book regular F&F rates do count towards the associate’s yearly maximum of 70 nights but rates designated as EXTRA do not. Therefore friends & Family members should book by default preferably these EXTRA rates.

Friends & Family members can book up to two rooms each for a maximum of seven nights.

The team member can monitor at least how many Friends & Family rooms have been consumed. However I am not sure if they see the EXTRA-designated rooms that don’t count towards the yearly maximum.

The Friends & Family rates should be 50% off but I have often seen them being less discounted but usually the cheapest if available.

Here are some examples

Hilton Garden Inn

Waldorf Astoria

Conrad

Code of Conduct

Eligible participants traveling under the Go Hilton travel programs are bound to the Hilton Code of Conduct. Eligible Participants are expected to embody Hilton Values and uphold the exceptional reputation of Hilton during every stay at member properties. Eligible Participants will be held accountable for any undue duress placed on the hosting property. Behavior inconsistent with program rules and our HILTON Values may result in loss of these privileges and disciplinary action up to and including termination. Family and Friends of Eligible Participants who use the Family & Friends Travel Program are also a reflection of the Eligible Participant. Any inappropriate behavior by Family and Friends may also result in loss of these privileges for the family/friend and the Eligible Participant.

You should be on your best behavior when using these Friends & Family rates like buddy passes on the airlines or the sponsoring person may lose their rate privileges altogether.

Also Hilton won’t entertain Guest Assistance complaints about stays that are booked under this rate plan as our recent Reader Question covered:

Reader Question: Stay Issues When On Hilton Friends & Family Rate?

You should not leave negative public feedback if your stay booked under these rate plans were not up to expectations.

Conclusion

The Hilton Friends & Family rate plan works similarly to Marriott’s that I have previously been eligible for (unfortunately my Marriott friend was laid off due to the Covid-19 travel slump last year).

You can usually save the most at expensive properties when their occupancy rates are on the softer side and prefer not to discount their public rates (think Conrad Waldorf Astoria and LXR).

I have made 20+ nights bookings at five Hilton hotels for August and all of them at publicly available rates because the difference between those and the Friends & Family was negligible. I have however a couple of EXTRA-designated F&F bookings for early September where the savings are significant.

Nobody should be jealous about the very low employee rates that Hilton grants to their associates or close to free space available tickets airline employees get.

It is good that employees explore various brands within the Hilton portfolio and are also engaged with the Honors guest loyalty program personally. Better for all of us!

Information that Hilton has publicly available pages about this program:

Go Hilton Team Member travel program Go Hilton is a leisure travel discount program for eligible Hilton Team Members and their authorized family and friends. Eligible participants can take advantage of special room rates and other perks. Team Members should visit the Program Guide on the Go Hilton Lobby pages as the main source for rules policies and other information that supersedes any other document including this summary. Booking a Go Hilton Stay Eligible Team Members and their authorized family / friends must each log in at the Go Hilton booking site with their own Hilton Honors sign-in and password to manage their own reservations. Tips for Finding Go Hilton Rates Use the Flexible Dates feature – Search for a 1-night stay and click the ‘My dates are flexible’ box which will let you see rate availability day-by-day in a calendar view for each hotel you select.

– If 1 night doesn’t have the discounted rate available for a multiple-night search then the entire search will come back with no results.

– Ex: If you searched for 3 nights but only 2 of the nights have the discount available the search would come up empty. If you do a 1-night search and use flexible dates you could see availability day-by-day and see the discount for 2 of the 3 nights which you could book separately if needed. Mix and match rates – Consider making separate bookings for shorter lengths of stay to “mix and match” between rates on different days at the hotel since 1 type of rate might not be available for several nights consecutively.

– Ex: Team Member rate might be available for 1 night and not the next but the Family & Friends rate might be available for the other night.

– If searching for 2 rooms doesn’t work try searching for only 1 room as there may be only one room available at the discounted rate on that particular night. Be flexible – Try to book as far in advance as possible to take advantage of all potential availability. If you don’t find what you’re looking for right away come back often. Go Hilton rate availability is based on forecasted occupancy which can change frequently.

– More rooms might become available closer to the desired stay date especially within 60 days of arrival since stay dates farther out in the calendar may be more limited and are often booked quickly.

– Consider searching for popular destinations during various seasons or nights of the week when availability may be more plentiful.

– Plan trips around when you find availability for the discounted rates. Checking in & staying with Go Hilton Rates – Team Members must be present at check-in and for the duration of Team Member rate and Family & Friends rate stays booked in their name and Hilton Honors account.

– Authorized family and friends must be present at check-in and for the duration of Family & Friends rate stays booked in their name and Hilton Honors account.

– Non-Team Members family/friends etc. cannot use Team Member rates.

– Authorized family/friends can travel without the authorizing Team Member when staying under their own Family & Friends rates but the family/friends do need to make their own reservations by signing into the Go Hilton booking site with their own Hilton Honors account. Number of rooms per stay – For each hotel stay eligible Team Members may reserve up to 2 Team Member rate rooms and 2 Family & Friends rate rooms for a total of up to 4 rooms in their own name and Hilton Honors number.

– Team Members’ approved family / friends may reserve up to 2 Family & Friends rate rooms per hotel stay (family / friends must make their own bookings with their own Hilton Honors account).

– “Extra” Team Member and “Extra” Family & Friends rates are combined with and treated like “regular” Team Member and Family & Friends rates for the maximum number of rooms per stay.

– Program users may not book rooms for themselves at different hotels for the same stay dates regardless of the rate booked. Number of nights per stay – Eligible Team Members can book up to seven consecutive nights at Team Member rates and up to seven consecutive nights at Family & Friends rates.

– Approved family/friends may book a Family & Friends rate for seven consecutive nights.

– “Extra” Team Member and “Extra” Family & Friends rates are combined with and treated like “regular” Team Member and Family & Friends rates for the maximum number of rooms per stay. Annual allotment of room nights – Each eligible Team Member can book and / or use up to 30 room nights per calendar year under Team Member rates and up to 70 room nights per calendar year under Family & Friends rates for a total of 100 room nights per calendar year.

– Each room counts as 1 room night.

– Usage of Family & Friends room nights by approved family / friends counts against the 70 Family & Friends room nights total.

– “Extra” Team Member rates and “Extra” Family & Friends rates do not count against the annual room night allotments. Hilton Honors Points stay credit & hotel benefits Go Hilton Team Member and Family & Friends rate stays are eligible to earn Hilton Honors Points on both room rates and incidentals and stay credit toward the next tier status based on Hilton Honors terms and conditions. Hilton Honors members are eligible for all standard Hilton Honors hotel benefits when staying under Go Hilton rates including room upgrades at check-in based on tier status and hotel availability. Hilton Honors Relocation & Recovery (Walk Policy) Occasionally a hotel may find itself in an overbooked situation. All Go Hilton Team Member and Family & Friends rate reservations in such situations are to be honored as any other reservation for a Hilton Honors member; Hilton Honors Relocation & Recovery policies apply the same to Team Member and Family & Friends reservations as to any other reservation type for overbooked situations. The guest should be relocated to another local hotel within a reasonable distance with all the usual Hilton Honors walk benefits based on the guest’s tier status. Code of Conduct – Eligible participants traveling under the Go Hilton travel programs are bound to the Hilton Code of Conduct. Eligible Participants are expected to embody Hilton Values and uphold the exceptional reputation of Hilton during every stay at member properties. Eligible Participants will be held accountable for any undue duress placed on the hosting property. Behavior inconsistent with program rules and our HILTON Values may result in loss of these privileges and disciplinary action up to and including termination. Family and Friends of Eligible Participants who use the Family & Friends Travel Program are also a reflection of the Eligible Participant. Any inappropriate behavior by Family and Friends may also result in loss of these privileges for the family/friend and the Eligible Participant. – Access to Go Hilton discounts may not be sold auctioned bartered brokered purchased or otherwise transferred. Any Go Hilton discounts obtained in this manner will be considered to have been fraudulently obtained and deemed void resulting in cancellation of the reservations. This applies to Go Hilton Team Member rates and Family & Friends rates. All such activity is strictly prohibited and will result in loss of Go Hilton privileges for the applicable Team Member and/or Family & Friends and can also result in disciplinary action for the Team Member up to and including termination. Such fraudulent activity will also lead to closure of the applicable Hilton Honors accounts and forfeiture of any Hilton Honors Points stay credits or other related rewards associated with those accounts. – The following actions will be taken by the Program for any Hilton Honors members who are fraudulently added to a Team Member’s Family & Friends list and/or who fraudulently book or use a Team Member’s Family & Friends rate room nights without the Team Member’s knowledge and consent: their Go Hilton / Family & Friends rate reservations will be cancelled by the Program; their Hilton Honors account will be closed; and they will forfeit any Hilton Honors Points stay credits or other related rewards associated with that Hilton Honors account. The Program will monitor such fraudulent Hilton Honors members going forward and such fraudulent activity on any new Hilton Honors account the members open will lead to the same treatment as above on the new accounts. – Team Members should inform all family and friends they authorize to use the program of the Go Hilton Code of Conduct and all Program Rules.

Food & Beverage Credit for Gold & Diamond Members. You asked for flexibility and we’ve got it. Whether you look forward to breakfast or would rather skip it in favor of a refreshing beverage and afternoon snack the choice is yours. In early July we’ll begin offering a daily Food & Beverage Credit that will continue through the end of 2021. You can use this credit at the hotel brands where you currently receive a complimentary continental breakfast as your elite benefit of your membership. You’ll now be able to dine when and how you want. We will share more details in the coming weeks.

As we reported the F&B credit amounts are the following:

$25 for luxury brands (Waldorf Astoria Hotels & Resorts LXR Hotels & Resorts Conrad Hotels & Resorts)

$12 for full service/lifestyle brands; $15 for full service/lifestyle brands in ‘high-cost markets’ (Hilton Hotels & Resorts DoubleTree Canopy Signia Curio Collection Tapestry Collection Motto)

$10 for Hilton Garden Inn hotels

Credits must be used daily and are reportedly per-person amounts (up to 2 registered guests per room).

Who Might Like This Change?

If you have been travelling in the United States for much of the past year you will probably have noticed that many hotels have yet to re-open their restaurants fully. No restaurant = no breakfast. Some hotels have offered a replacement that is truly embarrassing. But why should a half-full hotel attempt to staff up its restaurant for breakfast when many guests have Gold or Diamond status and wouldn’t provide any additional revenue to cover the cost?

So… if this is truly a temporary change – rather than a test of a future policy – then a credit that can be used on a snack or drink in the afternoon/evening is a welcome enhancement especially for those guests who don’t normally eat breakfast in the hotel.

And if in 2022 and beyond Gold and Diamond members are offered the choice of breakfast or a credit – or hotels are policed so that a voucher covers a reasonable breakfast option – this would be a genuinely welcome improvement to the program.

Who Won’t Like This Change? (Guests that Hilton Could Lose Permanently)

Hilton Honors is the hotel chain that makes it easiest to reach elite status even giving away its top-tier Diamond status to certain credit card holders. I suspect that this helps to attract infrequent guests who might otherwise book via an Online Travel Agency or stay at an independent hotel.

But when you analyze the benefits the key feature is free breakfast. Room upgrades are few and far between.

So what happens if you take away free breakfast – simple and easy to understand – and you replace it with a voucher? The mindset completely changes because…

The amounts proposed will definitely NOT cover the full cost of breakfast. Even when you apply the amount of the voucher to the cost of breakfast – often grotesquely over-priced because some business travellers will simply be expensing the cost – you are still left paying more for breakfast than many local alternatives.

Families will DEFINITELY know to avoid a Hilton hotel. Many Hilton hotels will provide complimentary breakfast for the whole family when the parent/registered guest has Gold or Diamond status. The type of traveller who would most appreciate getting the kids fed without leaving the hotel would be stuck paying for over-priced hotel breakfasts because the voucher wouldn’t come close to covering the cost.

The voucher won’t cover the cost of dinner at the hotel and many travellers (especially women) have ZERO desire to sit in a hotel bar in the evening drinking alone.

Marriott As a Guide to Elite Status Behavior

One of the things that is easy to criticize about Marriott Bonvoy is that each separate brand has its own rules about elite status benefits. In most cases Platinum Titanium and Ambassador members can rely on free breakfast in the restaurant and/or the executive lounge.

But at 3 main brands – Courtyard AC and Moxy – elite status members receive $10 per day. If more than one guest is staying in the room some hotels but not all will provide $20 per day.

But how does this drive choices? I can certainly provide my own perspective which is echoed by comments I read elsewhere.

I avoid these brands wherever possible – whether that involves choosing a different Marriott Bonvoy brand or staying at a different hotel chain entirely… depends on the options available to me. When I have no choice and must stay at a Moxy AC or Courtyard hotel… I choose a handful of points over a voucher I will never use.

The Bottom Line

With Marriott I can generally remain “loyal” while avoiding those brands that don’t provide free breakfast. (something I value) But what happens if an entire hotel chain stops providing free breakfast? Well I already avoid IHG due to the lack of elite benefits. Plus Hilton Honors could remove my incentive to:

Sign up for the Aspire credit card

Make any additional stays necessary to reach Gold or Diamond status

Choose a Hilton Honors hotel instead of the alternatives

And that is why Hilton Honors is playing with fire by replacing “free breakfast” with a voucher… Even though their hotel franchises might be able to cut costs or increase revenue a substantial % of Hilton Honors members will just stay elsewhere and let their elite status expire…",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9ndWlkZS9iZXN0LWhvdGVscy1iYWxpLWluZG9uZXNpYS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,15 dream-worthy Bali hotels to book now,"Update: Some offers mentioned below are no longer available.

Chris Van Jura is a business owner in the Washington D.C. area. After being laid off from his restaurant work Chris had an idea. He bought and converted a used food cart into his new hot dog business Catalyst Hot Dogs. The good news is that the business is picking up steam.

“Chris saw this cart and had a kind of revelation” said The Indicator from Planet Money host Stacey Vanek Smith in the episode. “He’d worked in the restaurant industry for 20 years and was managing a fancy restaurant in Washington D.C. But he got laid off during the pandemic and it was a terrible experience. He had a young child and a mortgage but he wasn’t sure what to do. He thought you know food service hospitality – that is what I know.”

Mr. Van Jura found what would become Catalyst Hot Dogs in the parking lot of a Korean church on Randolph Road: “For four years it had been sitting there with a for sale sign. So I was like oh that’s it. And that was it. I didn’t look at anything else. Truly I’m sitting here getting worked up thinking about it” Van Jura said to The Indicator from Planet Money.

Catalyst Hot Dogs which is “Bringing The Jersey Dog to The DMV” opened in December of last year. Originally setting up shop near Home Depot on Broadbirch Drive in Silver Spring the cart has since expanded its reach posting up at Bethesda Big Train games the Northwest Branch Pool and The Veridian Apartments.

Last June Mr. Van Jura ran a charitable promotion to assist a fellow food truck owner whose vehicle was stolen over Memorial Day weekend and found stripped a few days later.

James Turner a restaurant veteran with more than 30 years of experience had recently received a license from the county to begin operating as Beltway Bistro when the vehicle was taken.

The truck which was reported missing on Memorial Day was found in Charles County on June 3 badly damaged and completely stripped of equipment. According to reports Turner had spent more than $50000 on the truck.

“For those of you who weren’t with us a year ago Catalyst is not on the road without a go fund me [sic] and your generous support” Mr. Van Jura said in a Facebook post last June. Business is picking up as the area is reopening. “Somehow an opportunity was thrust upon me” Mr. Van Jura said to The Indicator from Planet Money. “Forgive me William Shakespeare. And we’re able to do something you know? I’m trying to make it great. We really are. And we’re having a lot of fun so – I will say (laughter) contrary to the emotions I’m having right now I’m very happy.”

That began to change in 2018 when the bank embarked on a quest to open 400 bank branches in new markets in the United States and become the first American bank to have a presence in every state but Alaska and Hawaii.

Chase the U.S. consumer and commercial banking business of JP Morgan Chase & Co. opened the first of its planned five branch locations in Central Arkansas earlier this month one of more than 60 branches the bank has opened around the nation this year.

Chase's presence in Arkansas was mostly limited to credit card services. In Arkansas Chase has 350000 credit card holders. It also has 14000 business accounts in the state.

""As a credit card company we've been servicing people across the country for 20 years or more"" said Dan Deegan who has led the national expansion effort for Chase.

Deegan was in town last week to help mark the formal opening of the Chase branch at 12900 Chenal Parkway. He and other bank executives were welcomed by Little Rock Mayor Frank Scott Jr.

""As a former banker I know how important banks are to a local economy"" Scott said at a ribbon-cutting ceremony. ""You are job creators You are job sustainers.""

Investing in new buildings may appear old school with the covid-19 pandemic accelerating the public's move to online banking and with many banks closing or limiting access to their lobbies.

But physical locations continue to play an important role in banking Deegan said.

""Through covid people have had to embrace technology even faster than they thought they would. We've certainly seen that"" he said. ""But people still like the idea [of being] face-to-face with someone and ask the questions that are sometimes more complicated: 'I want to get a mortgage I want to get an auto loan I want to get the right checking account.'""

Still technology killed the traffic at bank branches.

""They don't need to come as frequently as they did five or 10 years ago to the bank"" Deegan said. ""Direct deposit probably being the most impactful thing that has changed foot traffic. But we still have almost a million customers a day coming to our footprint of branches nationwide.""

Chase has 4960 locations in 44 states including the branch on Chenal Parkway according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

Still the concept of a branch has adapted to 21st Century sensibilities. There's no big lobby dominated by teller windows. Instead there are just two teller windows now called transaction windows.

The branch has six offices around the central lobby area. Associate bankers greet customers a tablet computer in their hands for setting appointments and other services.

The branch has a total of four automated teller machines commonly called ATMs. One is for drive-thru customers and another is for walk-up customers. Two more are inside a preference Chase has detected among its customers.

The ATM options ""make banking easy and convenient"" said Kyle Rhodes the branch manager. ""Do what you want when you want.""

But even Rhodes a banking industry veteran made a jarring discovery on his first day at the branch involving the big walk-in vault. The branch didn't have one.

""No big wheel or big lever to turn or needing two people to push the door"" he said.

Chase has four other branches -- three more in Little Rock and one in North Little Rock -- in various stages of development or construction.

All are in high traffic areas. The Chenal Parkway branch is situated next to a Target and Home Depot.

Chase is scheduled to open new branch banks at Cantrell Road and Southridge Drive one in Midtown in Little Rock and one on East McCain Boulevard in North Little Rock. The fifth branch will be at Chenal Parkway and Kirk Road.

""Locations are critical for us"" Deegan said. ""Three key things drive the selection. We want to be near where you live where you work where you shop.

""Clearly with Target and Home Depot here this is a convenient place where people are shopping. Ideally if we could hit all three of those buckets that will be convenient to our customers.""

Technology is a feature that limits the expansion.

""Years ago we might have built more because people relied exclusively on branches"" Deegan said. ""Now they do a combination of both.""

Chase plans to use the expanded branch footprint to develop new business with existing customers.

""What we have found surprisingly is our credit card customers consider themselves Chase customers already"" Deegan said. ""They just didn't have the opportunity to do branch banking.

""What we do is literally reach out to them whether it's by phone email or letter just to let them know 'Hey we now have a branch in Little Rock. If you'd like to learn about other ways Chase can help you feel free to come in.'

""So far over 10% of the accounts we've opened at all the other branches have come from credit-card-only customers that were there already and then we introduced them to the branch.""

Longtime Chase customer Caitlyn Schmidt a California native who moved to Hot Springs earlier this year made arrangements to continue her California work on the Upwork freelancing platform but she said ""when it came time to transfer funds I was denied the transfer due to name mismatch by Upwork"" because she didn't change her name on the Chase account when she married.

The only way to change the name on her account was to visit a bank branch. Before the Little Rock branch opened the closest one was 400 miles away she said.

Word that Chase opened a branch in Little Rock as a result left her ""overjoyed.""

""I was eventually able to complete the name change and only drove about an hour away"" Schmidt said in an email.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vNDJmcmVld2F5LmNvbS9uZXdzL21hbnR1YS1zdXBlci13YXdhLXByb3Bvc2VkLW9uLXJ0LTQ1LWFuZC1tdC1yb3lhbC1hY3Jvc3MtZnJvbS1leGlzdGluZy1zdG9yZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mantua Super Wawa Proposed on Rt 45 and Mt Royal Across From Existing Store.,"Reading Time: 3 minutes

On August 17 2021 the Mantua Township Planning Board will hear a proposal for the development of a new Super Wawa to be located on Rt 45 Bridgeton Pike at Mt Royal Road across from the existing “classic” Wawa store. Clearly the new Super Wawa with Gas Station will replace the older store.

The plan calls for a 5585 convenience store with fuel sales. While we don’t have the site-plan yet we can expect the familiar Super Wawa development of the core convenience store with food prep area and a separate large canopied fuel area.

For those not in the area traveling down Route 45 this location is just past the Home Depot and Kohl’s on the opposite side.

There is also a Heritage’s Convenience store in this area. Heritage’s sits at the corner of Rt 45 and Jackson Rd and will be unaffected by this project. The larger new Super Wawa will be located next to them taking the opposite corner of Rt 45 and Mt Royal Road.

Mantua Township also has a newer Super Wawa on Woodbury-Glassboro Road at the site of the former Clancy’s Restaurant.

A Long Development History with the Property?

In early 2020 the developer and attorney for Wawa appeared before the Mantua Land Use Board regarding perfecting a subdivsion approval from 2010.

Yes the property subdivision goes back to 2010! Although it’s not clear to me if that 2010 subdivision was also driven by Wawa.

The undeveloped area between Mt Royal Road and Jackson Road is over 12 acres with the core corner property Wawa is mostly interested in being on the Mt Royal Road intersection side at 3.21 acres.

Wawa does not need all 12 acres but it seems there are some property adjustments in play to extend the Wawa project into a portion of the larger plot of land down Mt Royal Road.

In the meeting minutes from 2020 it is described that the nearby Royal Oaks development had worked with the Wawa development team to implement a plan regarding a water basin.

With Wawa focused mostly on the Mt Royal Road side this should leave several acres of undeveloped land heading along Jackson Road (Behind Heritage’s)

Well I don’t have my hands on the site-plans yet so we’ll have to wait and see for the final layout!

Wawa Planned for Bridgeton Pike and Mt Royal Rd in Mantua.

Variances Requested

The properties are located in the Planned Commercial district.

The variances are what we typically see; property setbacks lighting signage.

Signage is always a big topic in Planning Board meetings!

One interesting aspect is it seems Mantua at one time was hoping for a larger tenant for the 12 acre property as the ordinance requires the first developed building to be 30000 square feet. Wawa of course is asking for a variance to develop a smaller building.

And because commenters will ask I’ll state that there is no mention of a drive-thru in this Wawa project. While Wawa is experimenting with the idea and has one South Jersey store in Mt Holly offering drive-thru I’ve seen enough of these notices to believe that if a drive-thru were planned in Mantua it would’ve been listed in the notice.

Meeting Details

A public hearing in these matters has been scheduled for:

August 17 2021 at 7:00 p.m.

Mantua Township Municipal Building

401 Main Street

Mantua Township NJ 08051

All papers are on file with the Secretary of the Planning Board and are available for public inspection during regular business hours."

This report “Rethinking Education Facilities as Digital Entities” the second in Honeywell’s 2021 Building Trends series presents the assessments challenges and priorities of education facility managers in the United States Germany and China.

“Education facility managers are tasked not only with creating an environment conducive to learning but also with protecting the safety of their students staff and campuses while at the same time managing new challenges to address asynchronous learning” said Michael Cavanaugh vice president and general manager Building Management Systems Honeywell Building Technologies. “Physical safety tops their list of concerns as they also shift emphasis to areas like improving indoor air quality which has been shown to positively impact student performance.”

It highlights current conditions in school facilities spanning both geographical regions and education levels — from pre-kindergarten through primary secondary trade schools colleges and universities.

Facility managers voice their concerns about physical infrastructures such as outdated HVAC systems as well as plans to invest in digital infrastructure to enhance site security occupant safety building health and emergency response.

The survey results from education facility managers across all three countries underscore five key themes:

Security and safety are top priorities. Half (52%) of respondents rank site security as a top priority including 34% who say improving site security through video surveillance access control and/or asset security systems is their top priority over the next 12 to 18 months.

Healthy buildings remain a focus area. Compared to their pre-pandemic priorities 63% of surveyed education facility managers are now more willing to invest in healthy building solutions. A majority (58%) of respondents list a healthy building as a top priority now and slightly more (60%) say it will remain a top priority beyond COVID-19.

Other top areas for improvement include creating a healthier safer environment for occupants (65%); minimizing downtime or disruptions (71%); and achieving or increasing energy efficiency (71%).

A smart school is a key to a healthier safer and more secure school. Across all three countries 64% of respondents are more likely to invest in smart building solutions today than they were pre-pandemic and 56% say the ability to manage all building systems through a single platform that provides unified data and insights is one of the most important aspects of a smart building.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9vYnNlcnZlci1yZXBvcnRlci9uYW1lL2phbmV0LWh1bGwtb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MTQxODU1OTfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Janet Hull Obituary (1943 - 2021) - Washington PA - Observer-Reporter,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/observer-reporter/name/janet-hull-obituary?id=14185597 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9vYnNlcnZlci1yZXBvcnRlci9uYW1lL2phbmV0LWh1bGwtb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MTQxODU1OTfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

The State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) on Saturday imposed a fine of 500000 yuan ($77141) on the company citing violations in its acquisition of China Music in 2016.

Following that acquisition Tencent owns more than 80% of exclusive music library resources giving the company an advantage over its competitors as it is able to reach more exclusive deals with copyright holders SAMR said in a statement.

The competition watchdog ordered Tencent and its affiliates to relinquish exclusive music rights within 30 days and to end requirements for copyright holders to grant the company better treatment than to its competitors.

Tencent will have to report to the SAMR on its progress every year for three years according to the statement and the antitrust regulator will strictly supervise its implementation according to law.

Bethesda Maryland-based Host Hotels & Resorts ended 2023 with $2.9 billion of available liquidity an amount that President and CEO Jim Risoleo said gives the REIT an advantage in negotiating acquisitions once attractive hotels and resorts hit the market.

""Frankly there just aren't a lot of properties that are currently listed for sale certainly not assets that would interest Host but that's really not slowing us down at all"" Risoleo said. ""We are talking to our competitors in the industry our friends in the industry and others to try to kick deals loose that are Host-type assets.

""We are leaning on our relationships. We're leaning on our reputation on our ability to close deals all-cash and that really gives us a very meaningful competitive advantage. And we believe this is the year to to get the balance sheet to work.""

Ideally the U.S. Federal Reserve will soon announce the first of several interest rate cuts Risoleo said and that will bring sellers out of hibernation.

""It's going to also spark competition for those assets"" that will come to market he said. ""Our point of view is we have the balance sheet; we can do it all. We want to get out there and we want to get ahead of the pack. And I hope over the course of the next several months that we're going to be able to tell you that we've been a net acquirer early in 2024.""

Asked about the wave of commercial mortgage-backed securities maturing this year and next and whether that will drive hotel sales Risoleo said the wall of distress hasn't materialized.

""This year there's about $26 billion of full-service loans that will be maturing and I know that earlier in the pandemic there was a lot of talk of distress"" Risoleo said. ""Frankly we haven't seen it materialize certainly not on assets or markets that would interest us. But we'll continue to track it.

""There may be pressure as we get later into the year because one of the things that other hotel owners are going to have to deal with sooner or later is reinvesting in their portfolio.""

Host is interested in acquiring large hotels and resorts with diverse demand drivers in the group business transient and leisure segments. Risoleo added ""bigger is better for us"" and that acquiring hotels in urban markets might be on the table again.

What's Next for Maui

Host's resorts on Maui — the Hyatt Regency Maui Resort and Spa the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani — continue to skew the performance of the REIT's portfolio as leisure demand decreased following the wildfires in August. Yet Host's Maui properties have benefited from a steady source of group demand.

Sourav Ghosh Host's executive vice president and chief financial officer said 2023 was ""the year of group and convention hotel recovery"" adding that group room revenue increased 21% year over year and the volume of group room nights sold recovered to 95% of 2019 levels.

""It is worth noting that our group results were positively skewed by disaster and recovery bookings in Maui"" he said. ""Group room revenue exceeded 2022 by 13% in the fourth quarter driven by an increase in both rate and room nights and we estimate roughly half of that growth can be attributed to recovery and relief groups on Maui.""

Efforts to rebuild Lahaina are ongoing and Risoleo said the west side of Maui will take more time to recover.

""In the interim we have been working with relief agencies in particular the Red Cross. We have contracted with the Red Cross for 350 rooms at the Hyatt Regency Maui through the end of May and we're hopeful that that will be extended while the recovery moves forward"" Risoleo said.

Host is also awaiting a resolution to Hawaii Gov. Josh Green's threat to ban short-term rentals if they aren't opened up as housing for displaced residents. In December Green said the state needed approximately 3000 short-term rental units set aside for Maui residents.

""March 1 is a pivotal date in our mind"" Risoleo said. ""The governor of the state of Hawaii has stated that if the owners of short-term rentals on Maui don't come to terms with allowing their units to be utilized by the displaced residents then he is considering a ban on short-term rentals. ... On the island of Maui in total there's about 30000 short-term rentals. It's quite significant and we're tracking it very closely.""

Risoleo added he hopes leisure travelers will return sooner to Host's two resorts in the Wailea area: the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani. Host concluded 2023 by wrapping up a renovation of the Fairmont Kea Lani's lobby and guestrooms in December.

""We're confident that over time as the consumer begins to understand the differentiation between Wailea which is a completely different submarket than the west side and Ka'anapali that will lead the cadence of business pickup"" he said.

And judging by what's happening all around us today it seems like the '80s are in again albeit with a 21st-century twist. I don't know about you but I'm a big fan of the '80s. We've seen quite a few cool projects being launched recently and today I stumbled upon another interesting one. This is the second time I've been gauging a Renault 5 Turbo this year with the first one being a rotary-swapped machine that was being auctioned off on Bring a Trailer.But now we're looking at the rebirth of the legend. Many people have wept over the fact that Group-B rallying was banned. But now we're getting those legendary machines back with updated technology. A German company just recently announced that they're building an electric hommage to the Audi Quattro . And now Legende Automobiles Los Angeles is launching their take on the Renault 5 Turbo which they've dubbed the Turbo3.The Turbo3 is more than a restomod. The Renault 5 Turbo was a childhood hero for French car designer Alan Derosier and he wanted to build something to match the brilliance of companies like Singer Guntherwerks and Canepa. As soon as Alan published some teasers of the concept online several other people wanted in on the whole thing and a crew was assembled. Their goal was clear: they were going to make the former Group-B icon more desirable than ever before.They wanted to create a car for people that are as passionate about driving as they are and you'll be delighted to hear that this car will come with a third pedal. Packing a turbocharged 4-cylinder engine the Turbo3 will have more power than any of its predecessors. Exact weight figures have not been mentioned but with 400 horsepower on tap this thing should provide an insane driving experience  to say the least.According to the builder ""Every single detail has been refined updated or redesigned to make this machine as timeless as possible and to deliver the most unique experience from the inside out."" This translates to the fact that the Turbo3 will feature a bespoke hand-made carbon fiber body kit among other things! Night-time driving won't be a problem like before as this car will also be fitted with LED headlamps.The car will be rolling on 16x8 rims in the front and 17x11 ones in the rear and customers can choose between two different designs. This is by all means a car that was born in the '80s  but it feels like it's perfectly in tune with today's trends. I get a feeling that this is going to weigh less than 2204 lbs (1000 kg) just like the original vehicle.The cabin looks clean yet futuristic at the same time and it looks as if you may get dual-climate controls alongside a huge digital dash upfront. There's no word about how much it will cost you to get your hands on one of these but I imagine that it's not going to be cheap. A 1980 Renault 5 Turbo can go for as much as $180000 and if you consider the upgrade costs you may end up paying Aventador money for the Turbo3. But then again if you've always dreamed about this car you might as well inquire about the product.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGVwZW5kZW50LmNvLnVrL3RlY2gvcHJpbnRlci1pbmstcHJpY2Utd2hpY2gtc3VydmV5LWIxODg5Nzc3Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Printer ink more expensive than champagne watchdog finds,"Sign up to our free weekly IndyTech newsletter delivered straight to your inbox Sign up to our free IndyTech newsletter Please enter a valid email address Please enter a valid email address SIGN UP I would like to be emailed about offers events and updates from The Independent.

Branded printer ink is one of the “most expensive liquids consumers can buy” a consumer watchdog has found.

Ink bought from major inkjet printer manufacturers is more expensive than high-end champagne and luxury perfume – and could be up to 286 per cent more expensive than third-party ink according to an investigation carried out by Which?

It said consumers could save a “small fortune” by opting for third-party ink.

Which? compared the prices of a number of big inkjet printer companies including Epson Brother and Canon to their third-party counterparts.

The total cost for a refill of Epson’s own brand ink for the Epson WorkForce WF-7210DTW printer including the required separate Epson black cartridge would cost £107.48 per refill (more than £2410 a litre).

However a full refill of the highest-rated third-party supplier in the consumer champion’s survey would cost just £10.99.

It found that over five years the cost of Epson’s branded ink would be 877 per cent more expensive than the cheapest third-party ink.

It said a multipack of ink for the Brother MFCJ5730DW cost £98.39 compared to just £29.21 from the cheapest third-party alternative and a full set of original-branded high-yield cartridges for a Canon Pixma MX475 costs £80.98 compared to just £12.95 from the cheapest third-party ink supplier.

It found that using own-brand ink for the HP Officejet 6950 would leave consumers £705 out of pocket over a five-year period assuming the full set of cartridges were replaced three times a year.

It added that 28 HP printers use a system called “dynamic security” which recognises cartridges that use non-HP chips and stops them from working. Other manufacturers use similar tactics such as promoting the use of “approved” “original” or “guaranteed” cartridges on their websites and in instruction manuals.

Two in five (39 per cent) of those surveyed who do not use third-party cartridges said they avoided them because they thought they would not work in their printer. However the watchdog’s consumer satisfaction survey found that no fewer than 16 third-party inks came out on top ahead of big-brand products from the likes of Brother Canon Epson and HP.

Adam French Which? consumer rights expert said: “Printer ink shouldn’t cost more than a bottle of high-end champagne or Chanel No5. We’ve found that there are lots of third-party products that are outperforming their branded counterparts at a fraction of the cost.

“Choosing third-party ink should be a personal choice and not dictated by the make of your printer. Which? will continue to make consumers aware of the staggering cost differences between own-brand and third-party inks and give people the information they need to buy the best ink for their printer.”

A HP spokesperson said: “HP offers quality sustainable and secure print supplies with a range of options for customers to choose from. HP offers customers the flexibility to use Original HP cartridges or third-party cartridges that retain the original HP chip or circuitry.”

Epson said: “Epson firmly believes that customers should be offered choice when buying printer ink and offers customers a wide variety of printing options to meet their printing needs; the traditional ink cartridge purchase mentioned by Which? is just one of these. As non-genuine inks are not designed or tested by Epson we cannot guarantee that these inks will not damage the printer.”

A Brother UK spokesperson argued that past Which? surveys said Brother inks were of a higher quality than third-party inks. It said: “We’re committed to supporting our customers with market-leading supplies that last longer deliver consistent print yields meet the rigorous standards for security and durability and are manufactured with minimum impact on the environment.”

A Canon spokesperson said: “Whilst third-party inks can work with Canon printers the technology inside is designed to function correctly with our genuine inks which are formulated specifically to work with Canon technology. Customers are encouraged to use genuine inks to ensure the longevity of their printer.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3MxOC5jb20vbmV3cy90ZWNoL3N1ZnJhY2UtcHJvLXgtaHAtc3BlY3RyZS14MzYwLW1vcmUtYmVzdC0yLWluLTEtbGFwdG9wcy1pbi1pbmRpYS1qdWx5LTIwMjEtNDAwMjQ1Mi5odG1s0gF7aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmV3czE4LmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy90ZWNoL3N1ZnJhY2UtcHJvLXgtaHAtc3BlY3RyZS14MzYwLW1vcmUtYmVzdC0yLWluLTEtbGFwdG9wcy1pbi1pbmRpYS1qdWx5LTIwMjEtNDAwMjQ1Mi5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sufrace Pro X HP Spectre x360 & More: Best 2-in-1 Laptops In India July 2021,"Laptops are probably the most-used personal computers in today?s day and age.

The No. 1-ranked and defending world champions took a few minutes to get their footing in the golden sand at the venue but when they did they were a force to be reckoned with.

Pavan and Humana-Paredes defeated the Netherlands duo of Katja Stam and Raisa Schoon 21-16 21-14 on Saturday to open their Olympics.

""I think today we made it clear that everything we've been working on has paid off"" Pavan said after the victory. ""The three times we've played that team it's gone down to the wire. Today we took care of it.""

The duo fell behind early to the Dutch trailing 5-2 in the first set and looking somewhat frustrated. But after an end change Canada rallied stringing together four straight points the fourth a huge Pavan block at the net to take a 6-5 lead.

She pumped her fist in the air before sharing a high-five with Humana-Paredes.

""Regardless of the empty stadium I was shaking like a leaf"" Humana-Paredes said. ""I was so nervous and so excited and put on a brave face.""

The team talked about needing to feed off one another's energy on the court because they normally thrive on the crowd. So any chance they get to ignite one another here at the Olympics they take full advantage of it.

Thousands of blue seats around the venue sat empty because of COVID restrictions — a similar scene at every Olympic venue in Tokyo still in a state of emergency.

Bell: Faster Higher Stronger - Sarah Pavan and Melissa Humana-Paredes Duration 2:35 What makes Sarah Pavan and Melissa Humana-Paredes faster higher and stronger? We break it down.

The Canadians started to pull away slowly from the Dutch. Pavan's six-foot-five frame was a huge advantage at the net blocking another Dutch smash to make the score 14-10.

The Dutch were visibly frustrated by Pavan's daunting presence at the net and started making unforced errors. The Canadian duo then cruised to a 21-16 opening-set victory.

""We came out a little slow just getting used to the environment nerves excitement everything. We settled in pretty quickly"" Pavan said.

The Dutch weren't about to go away too easily in the second set going shot for shot with the Canadians. Canada mounted a 12-9 lead before a technical timeout for crews to rake the sand court.

Humana-Paredes then took her defensive game to a different level and at times was seemingly all over the court digging up balls that seemed destined to touch sand.

The experience poise and power of the Canadians proved to be too much for the Dutch duo. Pavan and Humana-Paredes finished off the match winning the second set 21-14.

""Our game plan was on point. We executed our serving game very well and our defensive system. We were very prepared"" Pavan said.

She finished with four block points and 11 attack points.

One of the key strengths to Humana-Paredes and Pavan's game is their ability to communicate. Because of the silent venue their strategy could be heard very clearly throughout the venue. They were constantly talking to one another and sharing information to each other and it slowly wore down the Dutch.

""That's something we've been working on and it's a cornerstone of our team"" Humana-Paredes said. ""Our communication on and off the court we put so much work into that. Communication is what we always come back to.""

Pavan and Humana-Paredes now take on Germany in their second match of the tournament in Pool A.

There are 24 teams competing at the women's beach volleyball tournament including another Canadian duo made up of Heather Bansley and Brandie Wilkerson. They play China in their first game on Saturday night in Tokyo.

There are six groups made up of four teams. The top two teams from each group advance with four more joining them in the round of 16. Then that gets trimmed down to eight teams four teams and then the gold-medal game.

Melissa Humana-Paredes waved to the crowd at Shiokaze Park stadium on Saturday celebrating her and partner Sarah Pavan’s first win at the Tokyo Olympics.

If pressed Humana-Paredes could probably name everyone she waved to in the stands as there were only a dozen people watching the beach volleyball tournaments.

“There was our support staff our mission staff for Team Canada and they’ve all been very supportive” said Humana-Paredes. “Even just seeing a couple of friendly faces makes a world of difference. I was really just soaking in that moment.”

Pavan and Humana-Paredes defeated the Dutch duo of Katja Stam and Raisa Schoon 2-0 in the first day of women’s beach volleyball at the Tokyo Olympics. The Canadians won their sets 21-16 21-14.

Beach volleyball threads through Olympian Melissa Humana-Paredes’ bond with father

Tokyo is in a state of emergency because of the COVID-19 pandemic meaning no spectators are allowed in Olympic venues. Only people within the Olympic “bubble” can enter venues with media forced to keep more than two metres away during interviews.

“’'I think we can all agree there’s something missing” Pavan said to reporters over the hum of cicadas at an outdoor interviewing space.

“We thrive in a full stadium with all that energy but I think the strength of our team is that we are able to manufacture energy as well when we need to.”

Pavan and Humana-Paredes have been dominant since they first partnered together five years ago. They’ve reached the finals at 14 international events and won seven including the 2019 world title and a 2018 Commonwealth Games gold.

That world title qualified Pavan and Humana-Paredes for the Tokyo Olympics two years ago then the COVID-19 pandemic delayed the Games by a year.

“We have been waiting for this moment for so long” said Pavan. “Last year was a roller-coaster of emotion. To know that we had earned our berth so early and then to have it put on pause was heartbreaking.

“But we stayed disciplined and motivated and accountable – not only to each other but to our federation and to our sport and everyone who’s been supporting us.”

Their opponents from the Netherlands had a much shorter lead-up to the Olympics qualifying for the Tokyo Games last month. Stam said she wasn’t intimidated by the Canadians’ impressive resume because she and Schoon had come close to beating them in three previous matchups.

“I think they (intimidated us) in the beginning but now that we’ve played them in three and now four games and we were so close we know we can do this” said Schoon. “It doesn’t matter that they’re world champions.”

After a slow start that saw the Canadians trailing 5-2 in the opening set the pair dug deep for a 7-1 run.

A block-touch challenge by the Netherlands found that Pavan had grazed the ball on a deflected return tying it 9-9 before the Canadians again turned up the heat for a first set win.

Humana-Paredes said she was “shaking like a leaf” with nerves waiting in the tunnel to come out on to the court.

“I still get nervous before almost every game that we play” said Humana-Paredes. “These are big moments and you’re on stage and you just want to make sure that all the work you put in all the sacrifices you made that it shows through.”

A sharp spike by Humana-Paredes off the outstretched hand of a diving Schoon gave Canada a 10-9 lead in the second set.

It appeared as though the team from the Netherlands had stayed alive when a Pavan shot had gone out of bounds on what could have been the match-winner.

However an official review found that Stam had touched the ball on a block sending it out and clinching the win for Canada.

Pavan and Humana-Paredes will play Germany’s Julia Sude and Karla Borger on Monday.

Heather Bansley of London Ont. and Brandie Wilkerson of Toronto faced China’s Fan Wang and Xinyi Xia in Saturday’s later matchup.

Canada didn’t qualify a duo on the men’s side of the beach volleyball event.

Earlier Saturday a women’s team from the Czech Republic forfeited its match to Japan after player Marketa Slukova tested positive for COVID-19.

The Czech team said Slukova has entered a quarantine hotel where two other athletes and two other coaches in its national delegation are staying.

Blazing sun and heat? Check. Music provided by a DJ meant to evoke that rocking beach vibe? Check. The loud constant buzzing of cicadas? OK actually that part was weird.

But the real evidence that this was not just another match came before the first point. Sarah Pavan fired a warm-up serve wide. Her partner Melissa Humana-Paredes did the same then took a few beats to shake out her hands and do a few hops on the piping-hot sand.

The match started and the Canadian duo quickly fell behind to their Dutch opponents dropping five of the first seven points.

This was not how their Olympic campaign was supposed to begin.

Pavan and Humana-Paredes are the reigning world champions. It has been a long reign: they won the title in the summer of 2019 booking a ticket to Tokyo 2020 way back then. More than two full years later they were finally starting the quest for Olympic gold. You could forgive them for being a little anxious.

“I was shaking like a leaf” Humana-Parades would say later. “I was so nervous. I think both of us were. In the warm-up we were just trying to shake it out. But once you get out there and you play volleyball you just kind of forget about it. I think it was a bit of a shaky start but we got through it.”

They certainly did. Pavan and Humana-Parades among Canada’s best bets for gold at Tokyo 2020 asserted themselves after that wobbly opening few points downing the Dutch team of Katja Stam and Raisa Schoon in straight sets 21-16 21-14. The opening win in pool play sets the Canadians up with an excellent chance to advance to the Round of 16 with two pool games still to play.

When match point was secured Humana-Paredes waved enthusiastically toward the stands which might seem like an odd gesture in a stadium that’s almost entirely empty thanks to ongoing COVID-related restrictions. But she said no she was just thanking the small crew of Canadians — support staff and coaches — who had come out to watch them play.

“Even just seeing a couple of friendly faces makes a world of difference so I was just soaking in that moment” she said.

It has been some time coming. There aren’t official records kept for this kind of thing but Pavan 34 and Humana-Paredes 28 must be close to holding it: More than two years between earning an Olympic berth and realizing it.

“We have been waiting for this moment for so long” Pavan said. “Last year was a roller coaster of emotions and to know that we had earned our berth so early and to have it put on pause was heartbreaking. But we stayed disciplined and motivated and accountable not only to each other but to our federation and our sport and to everybody who’s been supporting us. To be here and having everybody still supporting us and cheering us on means so much.”

In an ironic twist the Dutch pair of Stam and Schoon had a much shorter wait having just booked their tickets to Tokyo barely three weeks before the Olympics began. Stam 22 and Schoon 19 despite their relative inexperience said they were confident coming into the match having played the Canadians three times in recent weeks and taking sets from them in each match. “We know if we play our best we can beat a lot of teams” Stam said.

Other than the quick start they were unable to put much pressure on the world champions. The Canadians levelled the first set at 5-5 and then took the lead with a huge block from Pavan at the net. Later in the same set she came up with another massive block to give her team a 14-10 edge and from there they were able to close it out with relative ease. Pavan who at six-foot-six presents an intimidating presence at the net had a knack on Saturday afternoon for those kinds of key stops. She had two more in the second set one to give the Canadians a slight cushion at 11-9 and another to help them seize control at 19-14. Just when it seemed like the young Dutch team might be able to string together some points and turn a set in their favour there was Pavan a veritable wall to shut them down and cause DJ Dice-K to play some high-tempo music in support of the big play. In the end it felt like a business-like win like the product of a team that knows what it wants to do and has to go out and execute it. Pavan would say as much afterward citing a lot of preparation and a defensive game-plan that worked the way they had planned.

They certainly have had plenty of time to get ready.

“It’s been a really interesting roller coaster of emotions being qualified for so long” Humana-Paredes said in an interview earlier this month before the team arrived in Japan. “And having that privilege and knowing that we were qualified was a relief at the time. And then as more time passed you realized what a luxury it was. And then only recently did it dawn on me the more that other teams were starting to qualify … that I kind of took that for granted I forgot about what a special moment that is.”

And so now they are here and the Olympics are happening and they have a win on the board.

“Now that it’s finally here the pieces are falling together” she said. “So we’re excited.”

Dave Matthews Band played their first show since the start of the pandemic at the Coastal Credit Union Music Park at Walnut Creek in Raleigh N.C. last night July 23. The show was broadcast live on SiriusXM Channel 30 (Dave Matthews Band Radio).

Dave Matthews Band opened with “41” a slow open track that builds upon itself to exhibit all the moving parts that make up the band. They then played break-out tracks “Granny” then “Grey Street” with its third verse for the first time since 2002. They also debuted their new song “Walk Around the Moon” for the first time live. “If we mess it up you won’t know it!” Matthews joked before beginning the song. Dave Matthews Band closed the set with “Stay (Wasting My Time).”

The band returned a five-song encore which began with a solo performance and live debut of “Singing From The Windows” from Matthews. They then “Pantala Naga Pampa” “Rapunzel” and “Kill the Preacher.” They closed the night completely with “Why I Am.”

Dave Matthews Band is partnered with the non-profit environmental organization REVERB which assists in calculating the carbon footprint in relation to fan travel to shows and helping bands neutralize these emissions by supporting carbon reduction projects.

Quantum computers might look like extravagant chandeliers but they actually hold great potential. And IBM's top quantum chief said Wall Street's use of the tech is on the cusp of taking off.

Quantum computing unlocks the ability to execute big complex calculations faster than traditional computers. It does so by leveraging quantum mechanics which is a form of physics that runs on quantum bits or qubits rather than the traditional 1 and 0 that computers typically use.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

For years theoretical research has shown that while quantum computing can be beneficial the cost for companies to deploy the tech has been too high to justify .

JPMorgan Chase for example has worked with IBM to use quantum to test an algorithm that predicted options prices according to a 2019 IBM research blog.

IBM's quantum computer required less data input cutting down the number of samples for a given simulation from millions to a few thousand IBM mathematician Dr. Stefan Woerner said at the time. With fewer samples he said computations could be done in near real-time as opposed to overnight.

While the technology was tested successfully and is ready to use the bank has kept the capability on the back burner. The resources required for the quantum machine made the classical computer a better more efficient option a bank spokesperson told Insider.

But that'll soon change according to IBM's chief quantum exponent Bob Sutor.

""When is quantum going to do something more for me than the systems I have already?"" Sutor told Insider. ""Within a few years we'll start to see that.""

That's because more people are starting to test quantum techniques. The more users Sutor said the more IBM — and others within its quantum network including JPMorgan Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo — can learn iterate and build off the rare instances when using quantum over a classical computer makes sense financially.

IBM is working to increase quantum usage

In 2016 IBM put quantum on the cloud and now has about 20 quantum computing systems accessible via the web Sutor said. Half are free to use.

Roughly 325000 people have registered to use the tech since 2016 and there are about 2 billion circuits (the tiny bits of code sent to the quantum hardware to run) executed daily he added.

An open-source tool called Qiskit enables users to code in Python when using the cloud-based quantum computers Sutor said a coding language specifically chosen for its widespread use and deep roots within the data science and AI communities.

Meanwhile IBM is making investments to grow the quantum team across scientists and developers according to a spokesperson who declined to specify numbers. The company is also standing up a quantum computer in Tokyo this year and another on-premise quantum computer in Cleveland Sutor said.

IBM's quantum computers are getting bigger too. The firm's first quantum computer was a 5-qubit machine (the number and quality of qubits reflect the machine's compute power). Now it has a machine with 65 qubits; by year end it will build a machine with 127 qubits; and by 2023 IBM will have a machine with more than 1000 qubits Sutor said.

Sutor said financial services companies are on the forefront of quantum exploration adding that ""their researchers are very hardcore when you're talking about artificial intelligence and now quantum.""

Speed matters for financial institutions performing risk calculations or algorithmic trading making a strong use case for quantum computing Howard Boville head of IBM's hybrid cloud platform told Insider.

Patrick Henry Weinheimer Sr.

Patrick Henry Weinheimer Sr. 80 departed to join Jesus in his eternal resting place on Friday July 23 2021 at 4:12 PM.

All are invited to a rosary service at St. Thomas the Apostle Catholic Church at 4100 South Coulter on Monday July 26 at 6:00 PM and Pat's funeral mass to celebrate his life also at St. Thomas the Apostle Catholic Church on Tuesday July 27 at 11:00 AM. Burial service will immediately follow at St. Mary's Cemetery in Groom. Arrangements are by Schooler Funeral Home 4100 South Georgia.

Pat Weinheimer was best at two things. Unconditional love and farming. Let's start with the farming first. Pat said do what you love and it will never seem like work and that labor of love was agriculture. Without a doubt agronomy was in Pat's blood from the moment he ordered his first Sears catalog garden tractor as a high schooler. His family farm operation grew into a highly successful diversified business raising cotton corn wheat grain sorghum alfalfa and cattle.

In his love for his wife seven sons and his Catholic faith Pat was the definition of unconditional love. He was great at a lot of things including husbandry mechanics mentoring parenting active listening and clear decision-making but offering unconditional love was his true superpower.

Pat's greatest joy and happiness was spending every waking hour with his loving wife Margaret (Maggie) Suzanne Mulloy whom he married on February 12 1966. Together they cherished 55 years of unity and fidelity with many pacts made knowing they would enjoy eternal life ever after side by side.

Pat loved his place in the world and always remained globally aware many times saying 'the traffic the construction the flowing creek are always happening whether you're here or not.'

Pat graduated from Groom High School in 1959 attended Amarillo College receiving an Associate Degree in Science and then graduated from West Texas State University in 1964 with a BS in Agronomy. He served in the U.S Army as a reserve stationed at Fort Hood from 1964 thru 1972.

Pat taught his seven sons the art and science of machinery and mechanics the skill that is forgiveness through forgetting and that there is nothing better than the smell of a rainstorm.

Pat would say he had a great life because he had it all - family friends (although remembering proper names was not his forte) and the Catholic Church as his cornerstone and blueprint for life.

Pat is the son of Albert and Teresa Weinheimer and was born on April 12 1941 in Fredericksburg TX in a small white farm house on the Pedernales River.

He is survived by his wife Margaret Weinheimer and seven sons including Patrick Jr. and his wife Kim and their five children and one grandchild from Groom Timothy and his husband Bret from Austin Matthew Weinheimer and his wife Kristen and their three children Benjamin and his wife Jennifer and their three children and two grandchildren from Amarillo Luke and his wife Angela and their four children from Minneapolis Jarret and his wife Samantha and their three children from Groom and Paul and his wife Lizette and their three children from Amarillo. He is also survived by his siblings James Weinheimer from Groom and his sister Theresa Swiger and her husband Phil from Bedford.

Pat's grandchildren include Brittany and husband Shannon Todd and wife Jennifer Will Laura and husband Jared Claire and husband Josh Emma Paige Peter Drew Jack Anna Alex Zachary Ruby Liam Jakob Jacey Samuel Carson Conor and Thomas (posthumously).

Great-grandchildren include Brylie Grayson Eloise and one on the way.

Ronald Alden Wright

Harwich - Ronald Alden Wright of Harwich returned home to heaven at the age of 87 on July 19 2021. He was born in Brockton the son and only surviving child of Forrest Coleman Wright and Dorothy Louise Belcher.

Ronnie graduated from Whitman High School at the age of 16 and went on to college at Northeastern University in Boston. After two years of college it became apparent that he was going to be drafted into the military for the Korean war so he enlisted in the Navy attended the Naval Flight School in Pensacola Florida and became a pilot.

Ron married his high school sweetheart Nancy Brett Battles of Brockton on September 16 1955. They enjoyed 65 years of marriage.

Ron served in the Navy for 12 years. Those years included flying across the Atlantic Ocean from Newfoundland to the Azores as part of the Early Warning System program three years as a Navy recruiter in New England and New York and a year in Guantanamo Bay Cuba.

After retiring from the Navy Ron moved the family to Hawaii for a few years and worked as a salesman for IBM selling office products. While living in Waikiki he and his family joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Ron and Nancy served faithfully in many church callings. When they later retired to Cape Cod they served together in the Boston Temple for 10 years.

After moving from Hawaii to Utah Ron attended Brigham Young University and in 1972 he received a B.S. in Geography an M.S. in Geography and an MBA. Ron and Nancy ran their own travel agency in Massachusetts and New Hampshire for many years and traveled the world. One of Ron's favorite places to visit was Jerusalem. He was a member of the Yarmouth Rotary Club for many years.

Ron is survived by his wife Nancy; his four daughters Bonnie (Bingham) Lynne (Eric Mercer) Becky (Sherwood Glazier) and Holly (Scott McMillan); 13 grandchildren and six great-grandchildren. He was preceded in death by his parents; his son Ronald Alden Wright Jr.; a son-in-law Perry Bingham; and a granddaughter.

Funeral services will be held on Monday July 26 2021 at 10:00 a.m. in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints chapel 94 Freeman's Way in Brewster. Interment will be held in the Massachusetts National Cemetery Connory Ave Bourne at 1:30 p.m.",,,,,,

The financial picture looked stagnant with 23andMe (ME) trying to build interest in the company’s FDA-authorized health insights and a subscription service that provides access to additional reports as they become available. As we noted in the article the company’s most valuable asset is its genetics database. Pharmaceutical companies like GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) which invested $300 million in 23andMe about three years ago can leverage the genetics data from millions of people to develop more precise therapeutics in areas like oncology and cardiovascular disease. But the genetic tests from 23andMe and other DNA companies only scratch the surface of what we can learn about hereditary conditions like cancer and heart disease. To see the whole picture you need whole genome sequencing (WGS).

What is Whole Genome Sequencing?

The kind of genetic tests offered by 23andMe and others is usually referred to as genotyping which looks for specific variations in genes across less than 1% of the human genome’s four-letter alphabet. Most of these direct-to-consumer genetic tests rely on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to act as biomarkers to locate genes associated with disease. SNPs are sort of like typos that occur when a cell divides and copies its DNA to new cells. It’s these typos or variations that genetic tests can use to identify potential problems. But the tests are quite limited in scope. For example 23andMe can only pick out three of the thousands of mutations in the BRCA genes associated with breast cancer.

Do you want the Cliff Notes of your genome or the encyclopedia set? Credit: Veritas Genetics

Whole genome sequencing on the other hand looks at all 3.2 billion base pairs (or 6.4 billion depending on if you count both sets of chromosomes) in the human genome. As you might imagine this provides a much bigger picture to identify genetic variations associated with disease. In the analogy above genotyping is the equivalent of reading a short novel versus a 4200-book library dedicated to your health.

Whole Genome Sequencing Companies

It originally took 13 years and nearly $3 billion to sequence the first human genome. Today it can be done for $1000 or less in just a day using next-generation sequencing (NGS) which involves sequencing millions of small fragments of DNA in parallel. Illumina (ILMN) is the company that pioneered genome sequencing at scale and its machines remain the gold standard with the stock bouncing back strongly after falling at the end of last year.

A number of genetic testing companies now offer whole genome sequencing by leveraging NGS technology (usually from Illumina) either directly to consumers or through healthcare providers. These tests provide a deep dive into a patient’s genetics. This not only enables doctors to treat disease through gene-editing but empowers patients to potentially prevent disease by providing personalized insights into their genetic makeup. While genetics may predispose someone to certain chronic diseases like breast cancer environment and lifestyle also play a role. The idea is that if we know where our genetic landmines exist we can avoid them and live much longer lives.

Playing the Long Game

That’s certainly the goal of the company topping our list – Human Longevity. We’ve been following the San Diego-based startup since 2014 largely because it was co-founded by leading geneticist J. Craig Venter. Founded in 2013 Human Longevity has raised $330 million from a host of big names including Illumina GE (GE) and Celgene which was acquired by Bristol-Myers Squibb at the end of 2019. The company has struggled despite its pedigree as one of the top longevity companies in the biotech world. Human Longevity has developed a diagnostic platform it calls Health Nucleus which uses whole-genome sequencing brain and body MRI imaging a cardiac CT calcium scan metabolomics advanced blood tests and more to provide health insights.

We were never good at math but that looks about right. Credit: Human Longevity

A 2020 study published in the journal PNAS showed that Health Nucleus provided “clinically significant findings associated with age-related chronic conditions.”

The Church of George

Another one of the world’s leading geneticists George Church is also a serial entrepreneur who has founded a whole bunch of genetics companies several of which offer whole-genome sequencing.

Founded in 2014 Veritas Genetics was the first company to break the $1000 barrier for whole genome sequencing. The Boston area startup has raised nearly $62 million from investors mostly based in Boston and China. The company’s genome interpretation engine uses its own machine learning tools as well as Google’s DeepVariant a deep-learning technology developed partly by Verily Sciences to reconstruct genome sequences. Veritas Genetics’ flagship product myGenome provides several different kinds of health insights. For example there is a section of the report that identifies more than 59 genes deemed medically actionable that are associated with cardiovascular health cancer and metabolic health among others. There are also sections devoted to genetic risks and carrier status for various genetic conditions as well as offerings like traits and ancestry. And it’s now available for only $599 with a doctor’s authorization.

Credit: Veritas Intercontinental

An offshoot of Veritas Genetics Madrid-based Veritas Intercontinental was founded in 2018 and has separately raised more than $25 million including a nearly $6 million Series A one year ago. In addition to whole genome sequencing Veritas Intercontinental also delves into whole exome sequencing (WES) which is the portion of the genome involved in coding for proteins. Most known genetic mutations that cause disease occur in exons so the company offers specific genetic tests for cancer. There’s even one that assesses risk for developing medical complications associated with COVID-19 infection. Veritas Intercontinental’s services portfolio also includes non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) a technique that analyzes DNA in the mother’s blood to determine if the child is the Antichrist at risk of genetic abnormalities.

Nebula Genomics is another George Church whole genomics company that we’ve covered before most recently in our list of genomics startups that investors should watch. Founded in 2016 San Francisco-based Nebula Genomics has raised $4.3 million. It offers several tiers of tests ranging from $99 for typical ancestry analytics to $999 for the whole shebang. The company differentiates itself by emphasizing privacy and security for its customers’ DNA by using blockchain to keep prying eyes away. Its most recent foray into fringe cutting-edge technologies involves non-fungible tokens (NFTs). More specifically the company is auctioning the whole genome of its co-founder professor Church. That’s got to be worth something right?

AI and WGS for Cancer Detection

Cancer is one of the primary targets of precision medicine today and whole genome sequencing can help identify the numerous gene variants that put people at risk. A New York-based company called C2i Genomics goes further by leveraging WGS technology to track cancer progression from a liquid biopsy. Founded in 2019 the startup has raised $112 million including a $100 million Series B in April. Based on technology developed at Cornell University and the New York Genome Center C2i Genomics combines AI pattern recognition and whole genome sequencing to detect residual signs of cancer after a tumor has been removed. The company claims its test is 100X more sensitive than competing technologies.

C2i Genomics’ platform is cloud-based leveraging existing genome sequencers anywhere on the planet meaning the company can offer its WGS-based screens at any location in the world. The company is still in the clinical stage as it continues to prove the technology.

WGS for Rare Diseases

Founded in 2014 and based in the Boston area Variantyx has raised $38 million in funding including a $20 million Series C in March that included IBM (IBM). The startup calls its whole genome sequencing testing platform Genomic Unity which focuses on rare inherited and neurological disorders. The brains behind the operation is something called Genomic Intelligence which uses algorithms and Big Data to analyze and interpret the genomic data. Thanks to the new funding the company plans to expand its WGS technology to tumor diagnostics.

Low-Pass Sequencing

Founded in 2015 New Yawk-based Gencove has raised $6.2 million including a $1.8 million Series A in March. The company is developing a type of whole genome sequencing called low-pass sequencing. Instead of sequencing a single sample multiple times as in WGS numerous samples are sequenced less than once. It’s sort of the difference between today’s best high-resolution smartphone camera and a super cheap flip phone camera. In this case the pixels required to create a comparable picture using the latter are added through a computational method called imputation.

Gencove scientists published a paper earlier this year that claimed the company’s low-pass sequencing technique produced more accurate polygenic risk scores for coronary artery disease and breast cancer than Illumina’s Global Screening Array a tool for genetic risk screening of large global populations. In addition to humans Gencove is developing its low-pass WGS for industrial-scale applications including identifying genetic variations in livestock and pets.

Whole Genome Sequencing as SaaS

Founded in 2016 Dante Labs is a whole genomics sequencing company based in the UK. It has raised an undisclosed amount of funding since 2018 including a mystery Series A in 2019. The company offers both clinical and consumer WGS testing through its Immensa platform which uses “machine learning to advance the interpretation of the human genome with every analysis.” It has performed more than 30000 whole genome sequences to date using a software as a solution (SaaS) model. The company recently acquired another UK startup called Cambridge Cancer Genomics which had raised $8 million for its machine learning platform focused on applying genomics data to precision cancer treatment. The plan is to combine their technologies to develop an end-to-end genomics-based diagnostics platform for oncology.

Like other WGS companies Dante Labs has also pushed into COVID-19 testing and analysis. Earlier this year it invested more than $40 million to run a global surveillance program to identify new variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Conclusion

The breadth and depth of this list of whole genome sequencing companies really illustrates how close we are to fulfilling the promise of the Human Genome Project that was completed less than 20 years ago. We can now sequence whole human genomes for less than $1000. That enables us to identify genetic variants that pose a risk to our health at scale leading to precision health solutions in oncology and more. Not to mention gene-editing techniques will soon be able to edit out bad mutations potentially prolonging our lives which comes with its own risks and opportunities. Whole genome sequencing is definitely an area investors should continue to monitor.

As time continues ticking by what once might have looked like something with the potential to show up as a budget option on our list of the best graphics cards feels increasingly like a part with no real market. Intel looks to be using this as more of a proof of concept than a full-fledged release — a chance to work out the kinks as it were before the real deal DG2 launch sometime presumably later this year or in early 2022. Technically the DG1 is available but it can only be purchased with select pre-built PCs. That's because it lacks certain features and requires special BIOS and firmware support from the motherboard to function. But if you could buy it or if you think one of these pre-built systems might be worthwhile how does it perform? That's what we set out to determine.



Best Buy currently sells precisely one PC that has an Xe DG1 card. The system comes from CyberPowerPC with a passively cooled DG1 model from Asus and it might be the only pre-built and DG1 model considering what you get. Besides the graphics card the PC otherwise has reasonable-looking specs including a Core i5-11400F a 512GB M.2 SSD 8GB DDR4-3000 memory and even a keyboard and mouse. One problem however is the use of a single 8GB DIMM from XPG. Another concern is the limited storage space — 512GB is enough for typical SOHO use perhaps but it can only hold a few of the larger games in our test suite. We fixed both problems by upgrading the memory and adding a secondary storage device.



The system costs $750 and given the specs we'd normally be able to build our own similar system for around $575 not including the graphics card. Unfortunately that means we have about $175 to work with on the GPU. If these were normal times we'd be looking at GTX 1650 or even GTX 1650 Super cards for that price. Sadly these are still not normal times as seen in our GPU price index which means you'd be lucky to find even a GTX 1050 for that price. And that's part of what makes the Xe DG1 potentially interesting: Can it compete with some of the modest AMD and Nvidia GPUs like the RX 560 and GTX 1050? Spoiler: Not at all at least not in gaming performance. We also encountered quite a few issues along the way too.

Intel Xe DG1 Specifications and Peculiarities

The Xe DG1 straddles the line between dedicated graphics and integrated graphics. Take Intel's mobile Tiger Lake CPU  rip off the Xe Graphics turn that into a standalone product and you sort of end up with the DG1. Of course Intel had to add dedicated VRAM for the card since it no longer relies on shared system memory. As noted above it also requires a special motherboard BIOS that supports Intel Iris Xe which generally limits it to certain B560 B460 H410 B365 or H310C chipset-based motherboards.



The reasons for the motherboard requirement are a bit convoluted. In short Xe LP the GPU at the heart of the DG1 was designed first as an integrated graphics solution for Tiger Lake. As such the VBIOS and firmware get stored in the laptop's BIOS. The DG1 cards don't have an EEPROM to store the VBIOS which necessitates putting that into the motherboard BIOS. Which of course raises the question of why Intel didn't just put an EEPROM on the DG1 since that should have been possible. Regardless you can't buy a standalone DG1 card and even if you buy a system with the card like we did you can't put the card into a different PC and have it work.



Here's the full rundown of the Xe DG1 specs with the Nvidia GT 1030 and AMD Vega 8 (AMD's top integrated graphics) that we'll be using as our main points of comparison.

Swipe to scroll horizontally GPU Specifications Graphics Card Xe DG1 GT 1030 GDDR5 GT 1030 DDR4 Ryzen 7 5700G Ryzen 7 4800U Architecture Xe LP GP108 GP108 Vega 8 Vega 8 Process Technology Intel 10nm Samsung 14N Samsung 14N TSMC N7 TSMC N7 EUs / SMs / CUs 80 3 3 8 8 GPU Cores 640 384 384 512 512 Base Clock (MHz) 900 1227 1152 ? ? Boost Clock (MHz) 1550 1468 1379 2000 1750 VRAM Speed (Gbps) 4.267 6 2.1 Up to 3.2 Up to 3.2 VRAM (GB) 4 2 2 Shared Shared VRAM Bus Width 128 64 64 128 128 ROPs 20 16 16 8 8 TMUs 40 24 24 32 32 TFLOPS FP32 (Boost) 1.98 1.13 1.06 2.05 1.79 Bandwidth (GBps) 68.3 48 16.8 51.2 51.2 TDP (watts) 30 30 30 65 (CPU+GPU) 15 (CPU+GPU)

So there are two different GT 1030 models and let's be clear that you don't want the DDR4 version. It's terrible as we'll see shortly. The GDDR5 model has more than twice the memory bandwidth and shouldn't cost too much more but some people might be thinking ""Yeah we can save $20 and forego the GDDR5."" They're wrong. Less than half the bandwidth makes a slow card even slower and Intel can easily surpass at least that level of performance though it will be a closer match between DG1 and the GT 1030 GDDR5.



At the other end of the Nvidia spectrum we'll also include a GTX 1050 to show what a faster card can do. That was nominally a $110 card at launch though the current GPU shortages mean it now goes for around $175 on eBay (that's the average price of sold listings for the past couple of months). But that card has 2GB VRAM while the Intel DG1 has 4GB so we also tossed in the GTX 1050 Ti (originally $139) and GTX 1650 ($149 MSRP) for comparison in our charts. Those have average eBay pricing of $208 and $295 respectively even though the MSRPs are much lower — and neither one can effectively mine Ethereum these days. It might feel like we're maybe going too far as those cards end up in an entirely different league of performance compared to Intel's DG1 but that was the market when the DG1 was in development.



We don't just want to look at Nvidia and Intel though so we've also got AMD's Vega 8 integrated GPU via two different processors as another comparison point. One comes thanks to the Asus MiniPC with a 15W TDP AMD Ryzen 7 4800U to which we've also added 2x16GB HyperX DDR4-3200 memory and a Kingston KC2500 2TB SSD . The other Vega 8 comes via the desktop Ryzen 7 5700G with a much higher 65W TDP and we've also equipped that system with 32GB of DDR4-3200 memory (CL14 though). The 5700G uses a Zen 3 CPU with eight cores and 16 threads while the mobile chip is a Zen 2 architecture still with eight cores and 16 threads. We've also included an RX 560 4GB card which has as much VRAM as the DG1 and GTX 1050 Ti.



In the current market where even slow GPUs are sold at premium prices — the GT 1030 is supposed to be a $70 card but currently sells for $110–$200 — the DG1's price to performance ratio could be its main selling point. Actually Intel put some effort into the video encoding and decoding capabilities of the DG1 and seems to be pitching that as another potential use case but we're mostly interested in the graphics performance right now. On a related note the DG1 felt quite laggy at 4K just running the Windows desktop at times (when resizing windows for example) which isn't perhaps the primary intended use but the 4K decoding and encoding prowess might be overshadowed by other factors.

In raw specs of the GPUs we've listed above the DG1 theoretically comes out on top. It has a wider memory bus and more memory bandwidth than the other options though the Ryzen 7 5700G could spoil the party. It also has more shader cores coming in with a theoretical 2.0 TFLOPS. But the Intel GPU architectures are less of a known quantity and drivers are also a concern. Will the DG1 be able to run every game we wanted to test? (Spoiler: Almost.) More importantly how does it perform while running those games at 720p low and 1080p medium?



Where AMD and Nvidia have Compute Units (CUs) and Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs) that are roughly analogous Intel's Xe layout continues to use Execution Units (EU). Each EU has eight ALUs (arithmetic logic units) which is basically what AMD and Nvidia refer to as a GPU ""core."" It's more like a processing pipeline than a core but regardless 80 EUs (out of a theoretical 96) and 640 'cores' should do okay especially with a 30W TDP.



If Intel were to simply scale this up by a factor of 10X it could potentially create a 300W TDP chip that could do 20 TFLOPS. Rumored plans call for multiple different models of the DG2 GPU with potentially anywhere from 128 to 512 EUs. Intel has said the architecture for DG2 will also change to include some form of ray tracing support along with switching to GDDR6 memory which should provide substantially better performance and features than the DG1. But let's see where Intel's DG1 lands before looking to the future DG2 products.

Intel Xe DG1: Asus's Passively Cooled Card

Before we get to the testing we did want to take a closer look at the Asus DG1. It's an interesting design opting for a large heatsink covering the entire front portion of the card. After so much time spent testing higher performance graphics cards it feels almost weird to see a single-slot passively cooled card. The DG1 only has a 30W TDP so it should be fine though a bit of extra airflow near the GPU could likely help. With the default configuration of the system we didn't see any performance issues but we were running in a relatively cool 70F environment.



Naturally the 30W TDP means there's no need for a PCIe 6-pin power connector. The card gets everything it needs from the PCIe x16 slot though the CyberPower system does include a 600W PSU with two 6/8-pin connectors if you want to upgrade it down the road like say when graphics cards start to become affordable again. We also tested the GTX 1050 GTX 1050 Ti GTX 1650 and RX 560 4GB on the same CyberPowerPC so there's no other factors influencing our performance numbers.



Video outputs cover most of the bases with single HDMI DisplayPort and DVI-D connectors. If you're hoping to do a multi-monitor setup that's less than ideal since you'd normally want to have all the displays running off the same type of connector. Still it means anyone with a monitor built in the last decade or so should be okay — unless you're hoping for an old school VGA connection in which case you probably need to upgrade more than just your graphics card.

Intel Xe DG1 Test Setup

Because the Xe DG1 requires a special motherboard our test comparisons will be a bit different from our normal GPU reviews. We normally benchmark graphics cards on a Core i9-9900K system with different RAM storage power etc. But for a low-end GPU the rest of the components shouldn't matter much — it's not like we're going to end up CPU limited here particularly with a 6-core/12-thread CPU running at 4.2GHz. Still the best comparison won't be any recent graphics card.



Besides being sold out even the GTX 1650 packs significantly more firepower than the DG1. Integrated Vega 6/7/8 graphics solutions from AMD along with Nvidia's GT 1030 theoretically deliver less performance depending on what metrics we're looking at so those are the primary comparison points (obviously with a different CPU on the AMD rig). There's more to the DG1 than gaming performance but that's where we want to start.



Our normal GPU benchmarks hierarchy includes nine games running at 1080p and medium quality as well as testing at 1440p and 4K plus additional tests at ultra quality for all three resolutions. All these low-end GPUs struggle a bit even at 1080p medium never mind the higher resolutions and settings. To get around that we also tested at 720p and low settings which is an incredibly low bar to clear — and a good indication of what we might be able to expect from the Steam Deck hardware . Our hope is that the cards should at least deliver playable performance (i.e. more than 30 fps) with these lower settings.



For these tests we're using an expanded suite of games as well: All thirteen of the games we've been using in recent graphics card reviews (Assassin's Creed Valhalla Borderlands 3 Dirt 5 The Division 2 Far Cry 5 Final Fantasy XIV Forza Horizon 4 Horizon Zero Dawn Metro Exodus Red Dead Redemption 2 Shadow of the Tomb Raider Strange Brigade and Watchdogs Legion) plus Counter-Strike: Global Offensive Cyberpunk 2077 Fortnite and Microsoft Flight Simulator. We're interested not just in performance but also compatibility. Theoretically every one of these games should run okay at low to medium settings on the Xe DG1 as well as the Nvidia and AMD GPUs. Any incompatibilities will be a red mark against the offending GPU(s).



Our test suite covers a fair range of requirements from older or lighter games to more recent and demanding games that might struggle to run at all. For example Assassin's Creed Dirt 5 Horizon Zero Dawn Red Dead Redemption 2 and Watch Dogs Legion all tend to have higher VRAM requirements — 4GB is just barely sufficient in some cases and the 2GB cards were blocked from attempting RDR2 at anything more than our minimum 720p low settings. CSGO meanwhile ought to run fine considering it works on potato PCs.

Intel Xe DG1 Graphics Performance at 720p Low

Here are the performance results starting with the more relevant 720p low performance. The wheels tend to fall off at 1080p medium for several of the GPUs but considering that's our minimum test setting for the standard GPU benchmarks hierarchy we did want to include those as a point of reference.

Right off the bat this is an inauspicious start for Intel's Xe DG1. Overall it did average more than 60 fps across the test suite but the 99th percentile fps clearly shows there's a lot of stuttering going on in some games. We'll see that in the individual results in a moment but of the GPUs we tested the DG1 only manages to surpass the GT 1030 DDR4 and the AMD Vega 8 running in a 4800U.



The GT 1030 GDDR5 came in 8% faster in average fps and 24% faster in 'minimum' fps and that's by no means a fast graphics card. You can see AMD's Vega 8 in the 5700G easily beats the 1030 GDDR5 and the other higher performance dedicated graphics cards are anywhere from 35% faster (RX 560) to 130% faster (GTX 1650). It's not just about pure performance though. As noted above compatibility with a large number of games is also critical for Intel.



For reference of the AMD and Nvidia GPUs the only ones that had any real compatibility issues were the 2GB cards. Red Dead Redemption 2 won't even let you try to run 1080p low never mind 1080p medium on a card with 2GB VRAM. You can try to hack the configuration files but we experienced rendering errors and other problems so we just left that alone. Assassin's Creed Valhalla and Watch Dogs Legion also seem to need more than 2GB except the GTX 1050 seems to do okay so I'm not quite sure why the GT 1030 minimum fps tanks so hard.



I should note that DirectX 12 (DX12) tends to also really dislike 2GB cards and sometimes even 4GB cards. We checked performance with DX11 and DX12 where possible and for the Nvidia cards and DG1 DX11 was universally faster — and in some cases it was required to even get the game to run on the DG1. For the AMD GPUs we tested DX12 was a touch faster in a few cases but in general DX11 was also preferrable. The problem with not working well under DX12 is that several of the games we included in these tests — Assassin's Creed Valhalla Cyberpunk 2077 Forza Horizon 4 and Horizon Zero Dawn — only support DX12. Let's hit the individual gaming charts before we continue.

Depending on the game the Xe DG1 as high as fifth on the charts — behind the 1650 1050 Ti 1050 and 560 4GB cards — and as low as eighth. The only card it beats without question is the GT 1030 DDR4 a travesty of a GPU that really never should have been released. Not to beat a dead horse but the GT 1030 GDDR5 launched at $70 in May 2017 and the GT 1030 DDR4 came out almost a year later in March 2018 with a price of $79. Of course cryptocurrency induced GPU shortages were also in play in late 2017 which likely explains why the DDR4 model even exists.



Against the 15W Vega 8 the Xe DG1 results vary quite a bit. Intel gets a big win in fps over the 4800U in CSGO but that's likely because the CPU and GPU share 15W so the 4800U CPU can't clock as high. Far Cry 5 FFXIV Flight Simulator Metro Exodus Red Dead Redemption 2 Shadow of the Tomb Raider and Strange Brigade are also poor showings for the 4800U Vega 8 and the DG1 outpaces even the 5700G in FFXIV Flight Simulator and Strange Brigade.



Nvidia's GT 1030 GDDR5 results are generally more consistent since it's in the same test system and doesn't need to share memory bandwidth. The DG1 took the lead in Assassin's Creed Valhalla Cyberpunk 2077 Dirt 5 Far Cry 5 Flight Simulator Forza Horizon 4 Metro Exodus Red Dead Redemption 2 Shadow of the Tomb Raider and Strange Brigade. That's more than half of the games we tested and yet overall the GT 1030 GDDR5 came out ahead. That's because many of the DG1's wins are by a narrow margin while when the GT 1030 GDDR5 comes out ahead it's often by a wide margin. The GT 1030 GDDR5 was over 50% faster in Borderlands 3 and Fortnite. Generally speaking though we'd give the DG1 a slight edge in desirability over the GT 1030 GDDR5 mostly because drivers can be fixed but there's no way around the 2GB hardware bottleneck.



Which is not to say the DG1 had a strong showing at all. Besides generally weak performance relative to even budget GPUs we did encounter some bugs and rendering issues in a few games. Assassin's Creed Valhalla would frequently fade to white and show blockiness and pixelization. Here's a video of the 720p Valhalla benchmark  and the game failed to run entirely at 1080p medium on the DG1. Another major problem we encountered was with Horizon Zero Dawn where fullscreen rendering failed but the game could run in windowed mode okay (but not borderless window either). Not surprisingly both of those games are DX12-only and we encountered other DX12 issues. Fortnite would automatically revert to DX11 mode when we tried to switch and Metro Exodus and Shadow of the Tomb Raider both crashed when we tried to run them in DX12 mode. Dirt 5 also gave low VRAM warnings even at 720p low but otherwise ran okay.



DirectX 12 on Intel GPUs has another problem potential users should be aware of: sometimes excessively long shader compilation times. The first time you run a DX12 game on a specific GPU and each time after swapping GPUs many games will precompile the DX12 shaders for that specific GPU. Horizon Zero Dawn as an example takes about three to five minutes to compile the shaders on most graphics cards but thankfully that's only on the first run. (You can skip it but then load times will just get longer as the shaders need to be compiled then rather than up front.) The DG1 for whatever reason takes a virtual eternity to compile shaders on some games — close to 30 minutes for Horizon Zero Dawn. Hopefully that's just another driver bug that needs to be squashed but we've seen this behavior with other Intel Graphics solutions in the past and HZD likely isn't the sole culprit.

Intel Xe DG1 Graphics Performance at 1080p Medium

Given what we saw during our 720p testing obviously most of the games we tested are going to run poorly at 1080p medium on many of the GPUs we've included in our charts. Some might say it's unfair or wrong to test the DG1 and integrated graphics solutions at 1080p medium but pay attention to the GTX 1050 and RX 560. Those are both budget cards that were readily available for about $100 prior to the pandemic and crypto driven shortages of 2020. Here's the overall performance chart that shows the average performance across all 17 games.

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

The DG1 nearly makes it to 30 fps average while the RX 560 is over 50% faster and the GTX 1050 is nearly double the performance. Except the DG1 gets a bit of help by failing to run Assassin's Creed Valhalla where it likely would have scored in the high teens. The 2GB GPUs also get a potential boost by not being able to run Red Dead Redemption 2 where the GTX 1050 likely would have averaged close to 30 fps if it had enough VRAM.



Hitting nearly 100 fps in CSGO also skews the overall average quite a bit but lighter games can certainly run fine at 1080p medium on the DG1 and other low-end GPUs. Still out of the 17 games we tested only six of them ran at more than 30 fps on the DG1.

Image 1 of 17 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

We won't spend a lot of time discussing the individual 1080p results as there's not much more to say. It's possible to lower the setting in some of the games which might allow the DG1 to hit 30 fps or more but you can see there are a few games where the GTX 1050 offers more than twice the performance even with half the VRAM.



If Intel had used faster GDDR5 memory on the DG1 that might have helped performance. Higher resolutions generally need more bandwidth and while 1080p isn't really what we'd call a high resolution these days you can see how the Vega 8 GPUs struggle as well likely due to the lack of bandwidth. But let's not sugarcoat things: Intel clearly has a lot of work to do with drivers and hardware to get performance where it needs to be for the DG2 launch.



Right now it's difficult to say exactly what's holding the DG1 back. Drivers are certainly part of it but the RX 560 has about 30% more theoretical compute and 64% more bandwidth and overall performance at 1080p medium was 62% higher than the DG1. It's possible that some driver tuning and more memory bandwidth would get Intel's individual GPU 'core' performance close to AMD's Vega architecture. Of course AMD is ready to move beyond Vega and GCN now so Intel needs to set its sights higher.

Intel's DG1 and Future Dedicated Graphics Ambitions

(Image credit: Raja Koduri/Twitter)

Let's be blunt: For a budget GPU GTX 1650 levels of performance are the minimum we'd like to see and the GTX 1650 is currently 175% faster than the DG1 across our test suite. And that's looking at the vanilla GTX 1650; the GTX 1650 Super nominally costs $10–$20 more than the vanilla model and boasts about 30% higher performance which would make it more than triple the performance of the DG1. Drivers can certainly improve compatibility and performance in the future but Intel needs more than that.



Could a refined DG2 architecture with 128 EUs and GDDR6 memory potentially match a GTX 1650 Super? Never say never but that looks like an awfully big stretch goal right now. On the other hand the fact that an Intel graphics card actually exists is already a lot more than many of us would have expected a few years ago. After 20 years of sitting on the sidelines and watching AMD and Nvidia battle for GPU supremacy Intel has apparently decided that it wants to throw its hat into the ring. Considering how the supercomputing market has evolved over the past decade to use GPUs for a lot of the heavy computational work and there are many workloads where GPUs can deliver an order of magnitude more performance than even the biggest CPUs there are plenty of reasons for Intel to expand its graphics portfolio.



If Intel can fix up some of the shortcomings of the DG1 and then get that to scale up to 512 EUs — or more — performance could be quite promising. Using 16Gbps GDDR6 memory on a 256-bit memory interface would give Intel nearly eight times the memory bandwidth of the DG1 and 512 EUs running at slightly higher clocks would land in roughly the same 8x ballpark. How fast would such a GPU be compared to the best graphics cards ? Theoretically an 8x improvement would put it right in the ballpark of the fastest GPUs in our GPU benchmarks hierarchy at least for 1080p medium. We'll still have to see how the architecture deals with higher image quality settings and resolutions but achieving that sort of performance is obviously possible — for example both the RTX 3080 and RX 6800 XT get there in slightly different ways.



Yet the question remains: Can Intel match AMD and Nvidia? As a first-gen dedicated GPU architecture DG1 comes up short. It only works in certain PCs (none of which use an AMD CPU) and even then performance is pretty lackluster. But Intel already knew all of this more than a year ago. DG1 is the harbinger for what comes next paving the way with wider compatibility and better drivers. We have very few details about the DG2 changes other than we know there will be far larger and more powerful chip configurations. DG1 was literally just a ""test vehicle"" for discrete graphics and hopefully it has given Intel the data it needs to build a second-gen part that will be far more competitive.



It will need to be particularly if the current trend of reduced demand from the mining sector continues and graphics card prices return to normal. DG1 gets a bit of a pass as there are so few other options right now. Yeah it's not really any better than the GT 1030 GDDR5 (for gaming at least) but it has similar power constraints and it's not completely sold out and overpriced. It also requires an entire PC purchase to go with the GPU which isn't going to help it gain widespread use. If the GTX 1050 or RX 560 were still readily available never mind the GTX 1650 and RX 5500 XT DG1 would have almost nothing to offer.



Intel's biggest task from our perspective is to improve the architecture and scale up to much higher levels of performance. There's a niche market for entry-level discrete graphics cards but the big demand for dedicated GPUs comes from gamers that want a lot more than just a modest improvement over integrated graphics. And beyond the hardware Intel still has more work to do on its drivers.



Everything should just run without complaint whether it's a DX11 DX12 OpenGL Vulkan or even an old DX9 game — or any other application that wants to leverage the GPU. An occasional bug or glitch is one thing but we encountered multiple issues along with some seriously slow shader compile times in our testing. Even the best graphics chip hardware won't matter much without working drivers which is a lesson we hope Intel learned from its Larrabee days.

The only differences between the two forms of competition were that the esports matches took place entirely online were laggy and were held outside of the official Olympics before the Opening Ceremonies began.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNlcnZldGhlaG9tZS5jb20vc3VwZXJtaWNyby1zeXMtMTIwdS10bnItMXUtMnAtaW50ZWwteGVvbi1pY2UtbGFrZS1zZXJ2ZXItcmV2aWV3LzIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Supermicro SYS-120U-TNR 1U 2P Intel Xeon Ice Lake Server Review,"Supermicro SYS-120U-TNR Internal Overview

Inside the system we are going to work from the front to the rear.

First we wanted to discuss the fan partition. Here we have counter-rotating fan modules. That is a higher-end feature compared to single fan units that we have seen in some competitive servers we have reviewed recently.

These fans cool the next feature we are going to look at which is the CPU and memory area. Here we have two 3rd generation Intel Xeon Scalable Ice Lake generation sockets (LGA4189.) You can see our Installing a 3rd Generation Intel Xeon Scalable LGA4189 CPU and Cooler guide for more on the socket as well as our main Ice Lake launch coverage.

Since we get many questions around the SKU stack we have a video explaining the basics of the various Platinum Gold Silver letter options and the less obvious distinctions.

Around the CPU socket we get a total of 32x DIMM slots. These can accept up to DDR4-3200 so long as the CPU supports it (see our 3rd Gen Intel Xeon Scalable Ice Lake SKU List and Value Analysis piece for more on that.) One can also add up to four DDR4 DIMMs alongside four Optane PMem 200 modules. We have more on how Optane modules work since much of the documentation is not clear on that here.

Supermicro designs its Ultra platforms in 1U and 2U form factors. As a result the motherboard has a number of features such as GPU power connectors that may be used in the 1U system but can also be used in 2U systems that have more space for accelerators. Designing a single motherboard allows Supermicro to drive up volumes. Higher volumes mean higher quality. They also mean that an organization can deploy the same servers based on the same motherboard in 1U or 2U configurations which is important for those looking to keep consistency in their lines. With the 12x 2.5″ front panel configuration drive density also scales with the chassis height in a linear manner which it did not necessarily do in previous generations.

Behind the CPU and memory we get the Intel C621A Lewisburg Refresh PCH. Next to these we have two SATADOM slots as well as additional GPU power connectors.

Also on the main motherboard we have the ASPEED AST2600 BMC. This is a new generation of BMC in Supermicro’s latest servers.

The final feature we wanted to show in this server is the I/O riser card. There are actually several things going on here. We have the dual NIC solution and the controller is placed on this PCB with its heatsink. Having a LOM-based NIC is very common in this class of servers however the way that Supermicro executes this with the integration on a 1U riser with additional features is different.

This riser also provides PCIe connectivity and not just NICs. One can see the PCIe Gen4 x16 internal slot. This is commonly used for PCIe connectivity that does not need to reach the rear faceplate. Examples include internal SAS RAID controllers and HBAs as well as cards with M.2 connectivity. Supermicro has used this format for generations but this is a full x16 slot (previous generations were PCIe Gen3 x8) making four total PCIe Gen4 x16 slots in the system. That is the advantage of Ice Lake’s enhanced PCIe capability.

Next we are going to check out the block diagram as well as the management before moving on with our review.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hzcG90LmNvbS9uZXdzLzkwNTM5LWludGVsLTEwbm0tcHJvZHVjdGlvbi1ub3ctc3VycGFzc2luZy0xNG5tLTdubS1yZW1haW5zLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel's planned comeback: 10nm production now surpassing 14nm 7nm remains a work in progress,"Something to look forward to: It looks like Intel is making steady progress on 10nm production and 7nm development. Component and substrate shortages may lead to fewer processors being made in the coming months but CEO Pat Gelsinger is hopeful the inflection point is coming later this year. Meanwhile Intel has beat financial Q2 2021 estimates as revenue grew 2% to $18.5 billion.

Intel is optimistic about its 2021 outlook. The company reported second quarter net income of $5.1 billion on revenue of $19.6 billion. This is higher than Wall Street's expectations of $18.5 billion in earnings and the company is now projecting a stronger non-GAAP revenue of $73.5 billion for 2021.

CEO Pat Gelsinger says the semiconductor industry has seen tremendous growth thanks to the accelerated ""digitization of everything"" and that this trend will most likely persist for the next ten years as people and companies increasingly opt for hybrid work models.

The pandemic has driven demand for desktop and laptop PCs and Intel believes its newest CPUs sporting Evo branding have a good chance of capturing a good chunk of the 400 million people who are expected to upgrade their systems in the coming years. On the other hand the most recent data from IDC indicates demand is already slowing as restrictions are eased.

PC processor sales were up 33 percent year-over-year which is why Intel's Client Computing Group brought in a record $10.1 billion in revenue in the second quarter 6 percent more than the same period last year. However the average selling price of chips decreased as a result of a combination of factors including high demand chip shortages and fierce competition from AMD in the gamer and enthusiast markets. After all Intel reduced prices for 10th-gen Core processors to sway buyers away from AMD options but still ended up selling more processors with lower core counts.

Gelsinger is optimistic about the semiconductor shortages and expects them to bottom out in the coming months. He also believes it will take up to two years before the industry is able to ""completely catch up with demand.""

Intel's Data Center Group saw revenue of $6.5 billion which is down 9 percent YoY. The Non-volatile Memory Solutions Group brought in $1.1 billion which is a 34 percent year-over-year decrease. Intel is currently in the process of selling off its NAND memory business to SK Hynix but until that deal is finalized it still has the potential to stain Intel's financial reports and business projections.

The IoT and Mobileye business units are up YoY. The former is up 47 percent while the latter has surged 124 percent to bring in a record $327 million in revenue.

Elsewhere Intel says ""7nm is progressing well"" and that it will start shipping large orders of Alder Lake chips to its partners in the coming months. The company has already shipped 50 million Tiger Lake processors to date but doesn't expect to be able to keep cranking them as easily in the third quarter due to an ongoing shortage of components and substrates.

Intel promised it will soon reveal more about its process and packaging roadmaps. Last year the company had to admit it was falling behind schedule to develop a 7nm process node but the company promised to fix fab issues and enlisted Pat Gelsinger to ensure it happens sooner rather than later.

Gelsinger established what he calls the ""IDM 2.0"" strategy which is aimed to regain the crown of the ""unquestioned"" industry leader in process technology. So far Intel has managed to increased its output of 10nm wafers to the point where it now exceeds 14nm wafers. As production of 10nm wafers ramps up they'll cost 45% less to make than they did a year ago which is great news for the company's bottom line.

In the coming years Intel hopes to manufacture chips for other companies under a separate organization called Intel Foundry Services that will report directly to Gelsinger. The company is also building two 7nm fabs in Arizona and upgrading a third in New Mexico to manufacture advanced semiconductor packaging technologies and we'll no doubt hear more about them at the ""Intel Accelerated"" event next week on July 26.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNoYXJkd2FyZS5jb20vbmV3cy9pbnRlbC14ZW9uLWUtMjMwMC1saXN0LWxlYWtz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,List of Intel's Xeon E 'Rocket Lake' CPUs Leaks,"An alleged list of Intel's Xeon E-series 'Rocket Lake' processors for multipurpose single-socket (1S) servers has been published by a leaker with a rather good reputation. The new processors with up to eight cores and Intel's Xe-LP graphics (select SKUs only) will be a part of Intel's codenamed Tatlow platform for entry-level servers as well as embedded applications. The chips feature different core counts and relatively moderate clocks.

Intel has not updated its Xeon E lineup since Q2 2019 when it launched its Xeon E-2200-series processors based on the Coffee Lake microarchitecture perhaps because the Comet Lake design did not really bring many advantages to the targeted applications. By contrast the new Xeon E-2300-series CPUs are powered by the Cypress Cove microarchitecture have a built-in GPU featuring the Xe-LP architecture (select units) AVX-512 support 20 PCIe 4.0 lanes and DDR4-3200 support. Such CPUs offer significantly higher general-purpose performance faster PCIe support and improved media processing capabilities (there is a catch about media processing capabilities though) when compared to previous-generation Xeon E-2200-series CPUs.

The list of Intel's Xeon E-2300-series 'Rocket Lake' CPUs published by hardware detective @momomo_us includes 10 models with a 65W 80W and 95W thermal design power (TDP) that are compatible with LGA1200 motherboards esigned for the Tatlow platform. Keep in mind that the list comes from an unofficial source so we cannot verify its legitimacy. Meanwhile Intel's Tatlow platform is probably several weeks away from its formal announcement so at this point leaked specifications are usually correct.

Intel Xeon E-2300-Series 'Rocket Lake' CPUs

The Xeon E-2300-series family includes three eight-core three six-core and four quad-core processors in the lineup. It is noteworthy that eight-core and six-core CPUs have rather moderate clocks when compared to Intel's Xeon W-1300 chips which is logical as Intel is somewhat restrained with cooling capabilities of entry-level servers as well as intention of server makers to ensure maximum longevity and reliability of such machines in all possible environments.

Six chips from Intel's E-2300-series CPUs feature a built-in Xe-LP GPU though configuration of these GPUs is unknown (it is safe to say that we are talking about GPUs with up to 32 EUs or up to UHD Graphics P750). Previously Intel integrated its P-series GPUs into Xeon E processors which basically means driver certifications for more than 15 popular CAD and professional graphics programs which is important for remote entry-level workstations and VDI (virtual desktop infrastructure) applications in general.

As for media capabilities Intel's Rocket Lake processors features a 12-bit end-to-end video pipeline that supports 4K/8Kp60 playback with Dolby Vision HDR and hardware decoding of HEVC and AV1 codecs. Meanwhile the number of video decoders and encoders inside Rocket Lake's Xe-LP implementation is lower when compared to the number of such units inside Tiger Lake's Xe-LP implementation. Therefore while Intel formally positions its Tatlow platform for tier 2/3 CSPs (content service providers) it remains to be seen how competitive this platform will be when compared to Intel's other solutions.

Speaking of Intel's Tatlow in general we should note that motherboards for Intel's Xeon E-2300-series processors are set to have up to four DIMM slots up to three PCIe slots up to two M.2 slots and up to eight SATA ports. Tatlow is intended for multipurpose servers for small businesses (SMBs) or government/enterprise clients (i.e. it can support appropriate security features) and CSP machines that do not need high-performance media processing capabilities integrated into its CPU.

Shares of Chinese education companies collapsed Friday in New York after the Chinese government issued sweeping new regulations to restrict after-school tutoring services and force a restructuring of the industry including bans on initial public offerings and foreign investments.

Foreign capital will be barred from the sector through mergers and acquisitions franchising or variable interest entity arrangements according to a document issued Tuesday by the State Council and the Chinese Communist Party’s central committee.

The document stressed that after-school training companies are also banned from providing overseas educational classes or classes that go beyond standard school curriculum. The ban on overseas classes might target preparatory courses offered to students seeking studying abroad said Ma Xuelei vice president of the research branch of the China Association for Non-Government Education.

Shares of industry giant TAL Education Group led the pack plunging over 70% to a six-year low. New Oriental Education & Technology Group Inc. sank 54% also to a six-year low. Shares of Gaotu Techedu Inc. which went public two years ago dropped 63% to about a third of its initial public offering price.

Together the three New York Stock Exchange-traded companies have shed nearly $100 billion of value from highs reached earlier this year.

Educational training institutions providing tutoring classes were banned from raising money through the sale of shares while already-traded companies were barred from investing in such companies’ stocks according to the document.

The implementation of the new policies involves millions of employees in the industry and parents who have prepaid large sums of tuition to training institutions. So a full rollout will require a transition time of six months to a year a person close to the Ministry of Education told Caixin.

Education department staff in Beijing and several other cities confirmed that they received the document and are conducting regulatory actions in accordance with it.

In a statement on its website New Oriental said Friday that its policy is not to comment on market speculation saying the regulations have not been published and the company has not received official notification of the regulations. TAL Education and Gaotu Techedu Inc. made similar responses in statements.

The government’s policy on reducing students’ academic burden has been around for years but in recent months authorities stepped up restrictions on the private tutoring industry and increased scrutiny of domestic companies traded in the U.S.

The Communist Party’s Central Commission for Comprehensively Deepening Reform in May issued an opinion on further reducing homework and after-school training burdens for primary and secondary school students. The document including implementation measures and trial programs was distributed nationwide to local authorities July 20.

Local authorities were told to stop approving new after-school education businesses offering tutoring on primary and secondary school subjects. Existing approved enterprises were ordered to become nonprofit organizations. Online platforms are required to get approval from regulators instead of following a registration-based system.

Publicly traded education companies will need to spin off their school-subject tutoring businesses and reregister as nonprofit originations with local bureaus of the Ministry of Civil Affairs and earnings from such activities can no longer be distributed to shareholders as dividends Ma said.

Otherwise listed education companies will have to exit school-subject tutoring services and explore other sectors Ma said.

The new document also sets strict limits on the time period when after-school training enterprises can provide classes. The institutions are banned from providing school-subject programs during public holidays weekends and winter and summer breaks. All classes have to end before 9 p.m.

The time restriction could cause a 70%–90% business reduction for the industry executives at several leading education institutions told Caixin.

The crackdown mainly targets training programs for students in primary and secondary schools known as nine-year compulsory education which is funded by the government. Subject training programs for high school students will be administrated in accordance with relevant regulations the document said.

Some industry participants interpreted that as a warning to the sector. It means that even though high school tutoring classes are not included in this round of restrictions the education authorities retain the right to address the sector in the future they said.

Before new the document was issued a senior executive at an after-school tutoring company told Caixin that many companies expecting their high school business not to be impacted by recent tightening policy were planning to expand into smaller cities for new growth.

The work on reducing students’ burden will initially roll out in Beijing Shanghai Shenyang Guangzhou Chengdu Zhengzhou Changzhi Weihai and Nantong and other provinces should select at least one city to conduct pilot programs. The measures being tried include reducing after-school subject training promoting nonsubject after-school programs and government-guided pricing of after-school programs.

Caixin learned that dozens of cities and counties in Shanxi Shaanxi Yunnan and Henan provinces took actions to ban after-school subject training and withdraw permits for such classes.

And while it's not quite what the International Olympic Committee or the sports fans of the world had in mind the games are well underway in Japan.

The Olympics opening ceremony looked a lot different without the presence of a huge audience in the stands. But there were still beautiful performances some pyrotechnics and a whole mesmerizing drone show above the Olympic Stadium. One of the standout moments was a heartwarming rendition of John Lennon' and Yoko Ono's ""Imagine.""

Singers from across the continents — the Suginami Junior Chorus (Asia) John Legend (the Americas) Keith Urban (Australia and Oceania) Angélique Kidjo (Africa) and Alejandro Sanz (Europe) — came together in a music video singing the iconic ballad. The choice of the song was definitely apt especially given the circumstances with the worldwide pandemic.

Artist Ono took to Twitter to give her thoughts on the performance.

""IMAGINE. John and I were both artists and we were living together so we inspired each other"" she tweeted. ""The song 'Imagine' embodied what we believed together at the time. John and I met – he comes from the West and I come from the East – and still we are together. #IMAGINE50 #Olympics""

This year also marks the 50th anniversary of the song.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9lbnZpcm9ubWVudC8yMDIxL2p1bC8yNS9nYXlhLWhlcnJpbmd0b24tbWl0LXN0dWR5LXRoZS1saW1pdHMtdG8tZ3Jvd3Ro0gFiaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL2Vudmlyb25tZW50LzIwMjEvanVsLzI1L2dheWEtaGVycmluZ3Rvbi1taXQtc3R1ZHktdGhlLWxpbWl0cy10by1ncm93dGg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Yep it’s bleak says expert who tested 1970s end-of-the-world prediction,"At a UN sustainability meeting several years ago an economic policy officer came up to Gaya Herrington and introduced himself. Taking her name for a riff on James Lovelock’s earth-as-an-organism Gaia hypothesis he remarked: “Gaya – that’s not a name it’s responsibility.”

Herrington a Dutch sustainability researcher and adviser to the Club of Rome a Swiss thinktank has made headlines in recent days after she authored a report that appeared to show a controversial 1970s study predicting the collapse of civilization was – apparently – right on time.

Coming amid a cascade of alarming environmental events from western US and Siberian wildfires to German floods and a report that suggests the Amazon rainforest may no longer be able to perform as a carbon sink Herrington’s work predicted the collapse could come around 2040 if current trends held.

Research by Herrington a rising star in efforts to place data analysis at the center of efforts to curb climate breakdown affirmed the bleaker scenarios put forward in a landmark 1972 MIT study The Limits to Growth that presented various outcomes for what could happen when the growth of industrial civilization collided with finite resources.

Now with the climate crisis increasing the frequency of extreme weather events and many single events shown to have been made worse by global heating the Club of Rome publisher of original MIT paper has returned to the study.

“From a research perspective I felt a data check of a decades-old model against empirical observations would be an interesting exercise” said Herrington a sustainability analyst at the accounting giant KPMG that recently described greenhouse gas emissions as a “shared existential challenge.”

“The MIT scientists said we needed to act now to achieve a smooth transition and avoid costs” Herrington told the Guardian this week. “That didn’t happen so we’re seeing the impact of climate change.”

Since its publication The Limits to Growth has sold upwards of 30m copies. It was published just four years after Paul Ehrlich’s Population Bomb that forewarned of an imminent population collapse. With MIT offering analysis and the other full of doom-laden predictions both helped to fuel the era’s environmental movements from Greenpeace to Earth First!.

Herrington 39 says she undertook the update (available on the KPMG website and credited to its publisher the Yale Journal of Industrial Ecology) independently “out of pure curiosity about data accuracy”. Her findings were bleak: current data aligns well with the 1970s analysis that showed economic growth could end at the end of the current decade and collapse come about 10 years later (in worst case scenarios).

The timing of Herrington’s paper as world economies grapple with the impact of the pandemic is highly prescient as governments largely look to return economies to business-as-usual growth despite loud warnings that continuing economic growth is incompatible with sustainability.

Earlier this year in a paper titled Beyond Growth the analyst wrote plainly: “Amidst global slowdown and risks of depressed future growth potential from climate change social unrest and geopolitical instability to name a few responsible leaders face the possibility that growth will be limited in the future. And only a fool keeps chasing an impossibility.”

Herrington who has a degree in econometrics from the University of Amsterdam and a master’s in sustainability from Harvard believes that the field of economic sustainability has to be made into an observable science that can be acted upon.

Her motivation she says is for the wellbeing of future generations. “I would like ‘the kids to be OK’ even if none of them were mine” she says. “I am driven by a passion for sustainability. Always have been.”

The policy officer who approached her at the UN meeting and spoke about the meaning and responsibility of her first name was not necessarily wrong she adds. “He was right in the sense that my drive has always come naturally to me.”

The key finding of my study is that we still have a choice to align with a scenario that does not end in collapse Gaya Herrington

The MIT study Herrington says was never about making predictions but to show potential paths forward during a time of immense change. Herrington’s review concludes that the 1972 study was essentially on target. The 1972 study’s authors Herrington points out were looking for paths toward a stabilized world in terms of economic growth.

She says there is nothing inevitable about its predictions – even now.

“The key finding of my study is that we still have a choice to align with a scenario that does not end in collapse. With innovation in business along with new developments by governments and civil society continuing to update the model provides another perspective on the challenges and opportunities we have to create a more sustainable world.”

At the same time she says the primary concerns of the MIT study have been supplanted. “Resource scarcity has not been the challenge people thought it would be in the 70s and population growth has not been the scare it was in the 90s. Now the concern is pollution and how it perfectly aligned with what climate scientists are saying” she said.

Technological advances have meant simply that we go farther and deeper to extract fossil fuels and despite some efficiencies consumption and emissions have only increased. The MIT authors she points out predicted as much.

“They said that even if we innovate ourselves out of resource scarcity we would probably see an increase in pollution from those adaptations unless we also limit our continued search for growth” she said.

In the new study Herrington focused on two scenarios using a range of variables or markers including population fertility rates mortality rates industrial output food production services non-renewable resources persistent pollution human welfare and ecological footprint.

Under one termed business as usual or BAU2 growth would stall and combine with population collapse. The other termed comprehensive technology (CT) modeled stalled economic growth without social collapse. Both scenarios “show a halt in growth within a decade or so from now” the study says adding that “pursuing continuous growth is not possible.”

Sustainability is the answer she says.

“There is a sustainable way of creating value and prosperity that also has immense economic potential. Doing good can still yield a profit. In fact we are seeing examples of that happening right now. Expanding those efforts now creates a world full of opportunity that is also sustainable” she said.

Ironically the pandemic she believes has even shown the world what might be possible.

“We’re totally capable of making huge changes and we’ve seen with the pandemic but we have to act now if we’re to avoid costs much greater than we’re seeing” she said.",,,,,,,,,

IVZ,Invesco,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzA3LzI0L2JldHRlci1idXktaW52ZXNjby1xcXEtb3ItZmlkZWxpdHktbXNjaS1pdC1pbmRleC1lL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Better Buy: Invesco QQQ or Fidelity MSCI IT Index ETF,"Both of these exchange-traded funds are among the best in their tech-focused class.

The technology sector has been the most impressive part of the stock market for some time now -- certainly over the past decade as it provided the propulsion for the longest bull market in U.S. history. How things will play out over the next 10 years is impossible to know but experts expect tech companies will continue to flourish transforming industries from finance to healthcare to energy as they blaze new trails with artificial intelligence robotics and more.

One excellent way for investors to capitalize on the general trend of technological advancement -- but without betting on which companies will provide the breakthroughs -- is by buying technology-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs). These offer both access to companies with great potential and diversification to temper the risks.

Two of the best technology-focused funds on the market right now are the Invesco QQQ ETF (QQQ 0.22%) and the Fidelity MSCI Informational Technology Index ETF (FTEC -0.03%). But which is the better buy?

Invesco QQQ

The Invesco QQQ is one of the most popular ETFs on the planet with about $180 billion in assets under management. It tracks the Nasdaq 100 index which is made up of the 100 largest nonfinancial stocks on that exchange. Those happen to be primarily tech sector stocks. As of June 30 the ETF had about 49% of its assets in technology stocks 19% in communication services and 17% in consumer discretionary stocks. Its three largest holdings were Apple (10.99% of assets) Microsoft (9.81%) and Amazon (8.34%).

Its performance over the years has been fantastic. Through the second quarter the Invesco QQQ was up by 44% over the prior 12 months has grown at an annualized rate of 28% over the past five years and a rate of 21% over the past 10 years. Year to date the ETF was up roughly 14% through July 20. Its expense ratio is 0.20% which is below its category average. In terms of its risk measures it has a standard deviation of 27.7% and a beta of 1.02.

Fidelity MSCI Information Technology Index ETF

The Fidelity MSCI Information Technology Index ETF tracks the MSCI USA IMI Information Technology Index which tracks about 350 IT stocks including large- mid- and small-cap names. The fund employs a representative sampling strategy which means it invests in a representative sample of securities that have an investment profile similar to the index. The securities selected are based on several factors -- including market capitalization and industry weightings fundamental characteristics and liquidity measures. Thus it invests at least 80% of its assets in the stocks in the index. Its three largest holdings are Apple Microsoft and Nvidia.

Launched in 2013 this Fidelity ETF does not yet have a 10-year track record to compare to the QQQ but it has performed extremely well over the period we can measure. Over the past 12 months through June 30 it has returned 44% and over the last five years it has posted annualized returns of 30.8%. Since its inception in 2013 it has an annualized return of 23.7%. And year to date as of July 20 it was up 14%. It has a low expense ratio of 0.08% well below the category average. Also looking at risk metrics it has a beta of 1.07 and a standard deviation of 9.58%.

Which is the better buy?

While these are both considered tech funds there are some significant differences between them. The Fidelity ETF is purely a tech fund while the Invesco QQQ is largely focused on tech stocks but is diversified into other sectors as well. That said the Fidelity ETF is more diversified within the IT sector with holdings that run the market-cap gamut and with more than three times as many holdings as the Invesco QQQ.

These are both excellent ETFs but if I had to pick one I'd go with the Fidelity ETF. It outperformed the Invesco QQQ significantly over the past five years and has had excellent returns since its inception. It also has a considerably lower expense ratio and more consistent returns as measured by its standard deviation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY2EvMjAyMS8wNy8yNC8zLWluZGV4LWV0ZnMtdG8tYnV5LWFuZC1ob2xkLWZvcmV2ZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3 Index ETFs to Buy and Hold Forever,"Individual stocks can be a lot of fun but if you’re looking for safety and stability index ETFs are where you need to be. Indexes are highly diversified by definition which reduces part of the risk (the “unsystematic risk”) in your portfolio. No you won’t get rich overnight by investing index ETFs. But you’ll definitely outperform anybody who bets the house on a small-cap play that goes wrong. With that in mind here are three index ETFs to buy and hold forever.

iShares S&P/TSX 60 Index Fund

iShares S&P/TSX 60 Index Fund (TSX:XIU) is the most popular ETF of Canadian stocks. It’s based on the TSX 60 — an index of 60 large-cap TSX stocks. That’s a pretty adequate amount of diversification giving you exposure to the bulk of the Canadian equities markets. The TSX Composite has over 200 stocks but it’s heavily concentrated in the large caps. As a result you’re buying over 90% of the TSX when you buy XIU.

XIU is a fairly low-cost fund with a lot of great features. It has a relatively low fee (0.16%) high volume and a decently high dividend yield (about 2.5%). Based on historical trends it won’t deliver a superior total return but it will probably deliver a modest return fairly safely.

Vanguard S&P 500 Index Fund

Vanguard S&P 500 Index Fund (TSX:VFV)(NYSE:VOO) is one of the most popular index funds on earth. It tracks the S&P 500 — the world’s most closely watched stock index. The S&P 500 is made up of the 500 biggest publicly traded companies in the United States. Whether you’re looking for big tech financials retail or energy stocks it’s all part of the portfolio that makes up VOO/VFV.

Given that this is a U.S. fund where’s the Canadian connection?

Well you can buy a Canadian-listed version of this fund on the TSX as VFV. It’s quite literally the exact same portfolio as VOO but your investment is denominated in Canadian dollars so you don’t need to deal with currency conversion or get confused by exchange rate impacts. VFV has a higher fee though so watch out for that.

Invesco QQQ Trust

Last but not least we have the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ). This is a fund consisting of the top tech stocks on the NASDAQ 100. It excludes financials so you won’t get stocks like Visa that are part of the NASDAQ 100 but not considered tech. Technically this pushes QQQ a little away from its benchmark arguably making it not a “true” index fund. But when most people think NASDAQ they think tech stocks so QQQ is a little closer to what investors are seeking than a 100% faithful NASDAQ 100 fund would be.

What does QQQ have going for it?

First it’s one of only a handful of funds of its kind. There aren’t a whole lot of NASDAQ 100 funds out there the main “competitor” being QQQM offered by the same company.

Second it gives you exposure to the U.S. tech sector which has historically outperformed most of the world’s equity markets for most of its existence.

Third and finally its fee of 0.2% is relatively low. It’s not truly dirt cheap like your average S&P 500 fund but it’s pretty reasonable for a tech fund that has higher expected returns. Overall QQQ is a great addition to any well-diversified portfolio.",,,,,,,,,

“You’re not in a bad mood when you’re having hamburgers on the White House lawn on the Fourth of July’’ Kovach said with a broad smile.

Kovach owner of Walnut Hill Farm scored the invitation through his activism in the farming community and participation in a high-profile video.

Serving as vice president of the Pennsylvania Farmers Union a state trade group Kovach is often called on to participate in meetings that focus on government interaction with the agriculture community.

His big hit was appearing on a public video meeting in May to talk about farming issues. But it wasn’t just any video – country music legend Willie Nelson and Tom Vilsack U.S. secretary of agriculture appeared with Kovach.

“I couldn’t believe I was on video with Willie Nelson and Secretary Vilsack’’ he said.

How that catapulted him to the White House invitation isn’t clear. Nevertheless he got it.

For Kovach and his wife getting into the party involved a lot more than just going to the door and flashing their invite.

+2 Shenango Dam slowly releasing all that rainfall Those thinking local rainfall has surged over the past couple of weeks are right – depending on where they live or play.

“We had to go through background checks before going’’ Kovach said.

When the Kovachs arrived at the White House gates on July 4 they had to produce their invitation and pass through metal detectors.

“We weren’t asked for our vaccination cards but we took them anyway’’ he said.

Once inside the grounds they were led to the south lawn with hundreds of other guests.

Attendees represented a cross-section of Americans — first responders food workers and physicians were among the professions represented at the party Kovach said.

The guests seated at outdoor tables were served traditional Independence Day food such as hamburgers and hot dogs.

“It was such a remarkable experience’’ he said. “Everyone was really friendly.’’

Biden put in an appearance and spoke 15 minutes on a number of topics that included COVID-19 improving the environment and the economy.

“He was cautiously optimistic about our progress with COVID and emphasized the need for unvaccinated people to get vaccinated’’ Kovach said.

Over several hours guests ate and listened to concert performers with a fireworks show ending the evening. Guests received gifts that included an American flag that flew on the National Mall in Washington D.C. during the inauguration of Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.

Biden shook hands and spoke to members of the crowd who were required to stand behind a roped off section of the lawn. Michael and Karen Kovach never got close enough to greet Biden personally.

But the trip was still meaningful.

“It was every bit as impressive as you thought it would be’’ Kovach said. “This was an opportunity of a lifetime.’’

Specifically petroleum oil and lubricant experts will spend the next few weeks preparing to refuel aircraft from across the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command's area of responsibility.

""Our team is here practicing new operations and concepts while ensuring the smallest footprint possible to actively accomplish our mission"" said Tech. Sgt. Patrick Barlow 366th Logistics Readiness Squadron deployed from Mountain Home Air Force Base Idaho acting fuels section chief. ""Our number one priority is to safely provide fuel support to our mission partners during Operation Pacific Iron.""

Barlow arrived on Tinian early and began operating in a MCA role immediately.

""Along with being responsible for my POL team here part of being a cross-functional team means I am also the acting on-ground liaison ensuring all units are communicating and mission-ready. This is just one example that demonstrates the MCA skill set which allows us to be more agile and flexible when performing operations""

Barlow is coordinating operations with five Air units on Tinian as well as local government officials in order to make the mission here successful for the whole force.

The team worked for days in scorching heat and torrential downpours to ensure the equipment is operational for when aircraft arrive.

""This team is actually brought together from different bases but from the same career field"" said Staff Sgt. Darren Albrecht 36gth LRS fuel operations supervisor. ""We are all learning from each other and operating as Multi-capable Airmen. This is one of the more challenging operations we have done so our team coming together and working so cohesively so quickly has made this a really rewarding experience.""

The ability for small groups of Airmen to refuel aircraft using bulk fuel bladders from any location assists the use of agile combat operations generating resilient airpower in contested environments.

According to Barlow having the capability to arrive at a location and be operational within 24-hours is key to achieving their main goal.

""We are using the fuel bladder to store the fuel we receive and then are able to deliver it to any aircraft who comes into our area of operations and requires it"" he said.

Albrecht further explained by saying that getting equipment set up in a short amount of time is essential to air-superiority so the jets can get back into the air and take the fight to the enemy anytime anywhere.

""This is such a unique opportunity to practice these skills"" he said. ""Tinian is a beautiful island and the local residents are so friendly and helpful. We really appreciate their hospitality and are taking advantage of this chance to perform such a dynamic and challenging mission.""

Being able to get fuel across the USINDOPACOM theater of operations is important due to its vast size. The command’s area of responsibility is more than 100 million square miles or roughly 52% of the Earth’s surface stretching from the west coast of the United States to the west coast of India and from the Arctic to the Antarctic making this an important capability.

""I'm excited to take these experiences concepts and lessons back to Mountain Home Air Force Base and pass them on to the Airmen there"" Albrecht said. ""This helps us to ensure long-term warfighting readiness across the globe.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyaXBzYXZ2eS5jb20vYmVzdC1yb2xsZXItY29hc3RlcnMtaW4tZmxvcmlkYS0zMjI2MjQy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,These Are the 10 Best Roller Coasters in Florida,"There is no shortage of theme parks in Florida and they offer plenty of roller coasters. But which ones are the very best? It’s subjective of course. But after logging plenty of miles riding Florida’s rails we consider these to be the top 10 coasters.

Before we get to the rankings a few notes. After perusing the list you may think that a couple of classic rides are conspicuous by their absence. Space Mountain and Big Thunder Mountain both at Walt Disney World’s Magic Kingdom are certainly two of the most popular and beloved coasters on the planet let alone Florida. While they are nicely themed neither offers ride experiences or thrills that compare to the attractions that made the list.

We were considering giving an honorable mention nod to Space Mountain because it is such a classic and iconic attraction. But the ride experience has become so rough we vetoed that idea. (The version of Space Mountain at Disneyland in California got a major makeover in 2005 and is much smoother than its Disney World counterpart.)

Also missing is Hollywood Rip Ride Rockit at Universal Studios Florida. The highly unique ride offers plenty of thrills and is quite a sight but it can be fairly brutal with lots of head banging shimmying and generally uncomfortable moments. It therefore does not make the list. Despite an overhaul that included new trains and the replacement of most of its track the Incredible Hulk at Universal’s Islands of Adventure remains relatively rough and also does not make the cut.

2018 brought Slinky Dog Dash a coaster that is the centerpiece of Toy Story Land at Disney’s Hollywood Studios. It is a wonderful and charming ride that is accessible to young children yet still offers decent thrills. While it is a great addition to Walt Disney World it does not displace any of the other coasters on Florida’s top-10 list.

Coasters We Are Highly Anticipating

The following Florida rides are under construction and are generating a lot of buzz. All four have the potential to displace any of the coasters on the list. Note that some of the rides were supposed to open in 2020 but were delayed because of the coronavirus pandemic.

SeaWorld Entertainment

Iron Gwazi

Of the upcoming coasters this one is the most buzzworthy among thrill ride fanatics. In fact we wouldn’t be surprised if it took the top spot on the best Florida coasters list. Iron Gwazi was scheduled to debut at Busch Gardens Tampa just as the park closed in March 2020 for the COVID-19 pandemic. Known as a wooden-steel hybrid coaster it will feature a new steel track affixed to the modified wooden structure of the park’s former Gwazi coaster. All of the wooden-steel hybrid makeovers have produced great coasters. At 206 feet tall and 76 mph Iron Gwazi will be Florida’s tallest and fastest coaster. And if it is anything like other hybrid coasters (and it should be) the Busch Gardens ride will be remarkably smooth. It will likely be among the world's best wooden-steel hybrid coasters.

TRON Lightcycle / Run

Originally scheduled to open at the Magic Kingdom (next to Space Mountain) in time for Walt Disney World’s 50th anniversary in 2021 TRON has been delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic. It will be similar to the TRON coaster at Shanghai Disneyland. That highly themed attraction cleverly uses magnetic launch technology to blast passengers into the “Grid” of Disney’s classic sci-fi film. At nearly 60 mph the kick-ass ride is the fastest coaster at any Disney park.

Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind

Another heavily themed indoor coaster Epcot’s Cosmic Rewind was also scheduled to open before Disney World’s 50th anniversary celebration kicks off in 2021 but has been delayed as well. Its vehicles will rotate 360 degrees and the coaster will feature a reverse launch. Disney is characterizing the attraction as a family-friendly “storytelling coaster.”

SeaWorld Parks and Entertainment

Ice Breaker

Delayed to 2021 Ice Breaker will be SeaWorld Orlando's sixth coaster and it will be a doozy. The launched coaster will navigate a 93-foot spike at 100 degrees (that's beyond vertical folks) hit 52 mph and climb up over and down an 80-foot top hat tower. SeaWorld promises the ride will deliver plenty of airtime including while the train is going backwards during the launch sequence.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8va3V3YWl0dGltZXMuY29tL3dpdGgtZmlyc3QtcG9zdGh1bW91cy1hbGJ1bS1wcmluY2UtcGllcmNlcy1hbWVyaWNhbi1jb25kaXRpb27SAVlodHRwczovL2t1d2FpdHRpbWVzLmNvbS93aXRoLWZpcnN0LXBvc3RodW1vdXMtYWxidW0tcHJpbmNlLXBpZXJjZXMtYW1lcmljYW4tY29uZGl0aW9uL2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,With first posthumous album Prince pierces American condition,"With first posthumous album Prince pierces American condition

Prince's estate will soon issue a completed record from the mercurial artist's storied music vault the first never-before-heard album released since the musician's shock death five years ago. ""Welcome 2 America"" - a 12-track album finished in 2010 but shelved for reasons unknown in the famous vault at Prince's Paisley Park compound near Minneapolis - offers a prophetic window into social struggles at today's forefront delving into racism political division technology and disinformation.

Melding urgent lyricism with languorous funk the pop shapeshifter Prince sings of America as the ""land of the free / home of the slave"". The artist who died at 57 on April 21 2016 following an accidental fentanyl overdose could not have known that in the years following his death his beloved home city would explode in furor and protest after the police killing of George Floyd a Black man.

But Prince was a career activist advocating for the empowerment of Black people in the recording industry and beyond. ""You go to school just to learn / about what never existed"" Prince sings on the closing track ""One Day We Will All B Free. But if your history only burns / it's better to resist it.""

The album out July 30 sees Prince level ""a laser-focused assault on the condition of America"" said Morris Hayes Prince's longtime keyboardist and musical director. ""What's going on with social media social justice and social consciousness... this is a concerted effort to really speak about these things"" said Hayes who co-produced the album. ""I really dug how raw it was and as far as my production I just wanted to keep it to where its raw and I don't get in the way of what he's trying to say.""

'Liberty and justice'

For Hayes the singular artist ""was way ahead"" like a ""sage sitting in the Himalayas somewhere"" in foreshadowing the current moment. ""He wanted I believe a country that actually stood for what it said it stood for: liberty and justice for all"" Hayes told AFP in an interview. ""And we painfully know that that's not the case."" For Prince a key component of freedom was ownership according to Hayes: ""if you don't own your own things you don't have any freedom.""

The artist was well known for taking labels to task famously scrawling ""slave"" on his cheek and changing his name to an unpronounceable ""love symbol"" in the 1990s to protest Warner's bid to rein in his prolific musical output. Hayes said Prince - who didn't carry a cell phone and memorized necessary phone numbers - also discussed freedom in terms of technology and devices which he saw ""as something that handcuffed people.""

But while the album tackles decidedly weighty topics - ""Running Game (Son of a Slave Master)"" centers on racism while ""Same Page Different Book"" touches on religious strife - the album also includes vintage danceable and carnal slow jam Prince in the mix. ""Hot Summer"" is a major-key guitar-heavy feel-good track while the sparsely arranged ""When She Comes"" featuring the artist's falsetto recalls the hypersexual ""Dirty Mind"" Prince of yore.

Excavating the vault

An untold number of songs - upwards of 8000 per Princian lore - were stored in the vault under Paisley Park though some of its contents have been moved to the Los Angeles climate-controlled storage facility Iron Mountain. ""It was crazy"" Hayes says of the vault. ""All of this music like all over the floor all stacked up to the ceiling. You have to think about how prolific a cat has to be to have his own vault full of stuff. And I mean FULL of stuff.""

Hayes recalled that in the mid-1990s Prince told him he had taken time off for the first time. ""He said 'never in my career have I taken a week where I didn't write a song and pick up my guitar.'"" The release of Prince's vast trove of music remains a sensitive subject; the superstar was controlling of his work image and carefully constructed enigmatic persona. Doing right by him is no small challenge.

Previously the estate has re-released expanded versions of Prince's milestone albums like ""1999"" and ""Sign O' The Times"" along with demos of songs he wrote that eventually became other artists' hits. Prince was never clear about his intentions for his unheard work but he had taken steps to preserve his tapes films scripts and music along with his Paisley Park compound leading his estate - run by his sister and five half-siblings - to believe he wanted it shared. Asked by Rolling Stone in 2014 what he wanted to come of his oeuvre after he was gone Prince himself was characteristically nebulous. ""I don't think about 'gone.'"" - AFP",,,
JBHT,JB Hunt,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFya2Fuc2Fzb25saW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvanVsLzI1L3NoYW5ub24tc2FtcGxlcy1uZXd0b24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,HIGH PROFILE: Shannon Samples Newton a key figure in Arkansas trucking | Arkansas Democrat Gazette,"Shannon Newton has an astonishing fact on the economic impact on the closing of the Interstate 40 bridge into Memphis after the discovery of a crack in the structure in early May.

""If you have ever driven to Memphis you are aware of how many trucks are on that road"" Newton says. ""It is one of the most heavily traveled in the country. At the start the impact was substantial costing the [trucking] industry $2.4 million dollars a day.""

Newton has trucking facts and figures at her fingertips because she is president of the Arkansas Trucking Association which according to its mission statement ""promotes the health of the Arkansas trucking industry on issues that have a direct impact on member companies and our state and national economies."" The ATA is made up of more than 300 trucking companies and trucking industry suppliers.

Newton's rise to being a key figure in Arkansas trucking -- a vital part of the state's economic engine -- is as surprising as it was quick. She wasted no time working for a trucking company after earning her college degree. Her ability to advocate for trucking didn't stay hidden for long and she was fast-tracked to positions of power. Being in a business filled mostly with men is only one of the obstacles Newton has overcome.

""Being a female is a greater challenge in my role as it is critical for me to build rapport with trucking executives legislators and other policy makers all of which are predominantly men"" Newton says. ""Because I miss out on all the golf outings and hunting trips I have to be more intentional with the opportunities available to me.""

Newton hasn't just impressed those working in trucking in Arkansas. Her efforts received national recognition. She was selected as the 17th recipient of the American Trucking Associations' President's Trucking Association Executives Council (TAEC) Leadership Award.

""Our industry benefits greatly from leaders like Shannon who build coalitions generate relationships and make sure pro-safety pro-trucking policies are enacted at the state level and supported at the national level"" says incoming ATA Chairman Barry Pottle president of Pottle's Transportation.

It's very clear that Arkansas truckers are happy to have Newton on their side especially as vital issues to road-dependent companies such as infrastructure repair become a hot topic in Washington.

""Shannon just knows how to get things done"" says Craig Harper chief sustainability officer and executive vice president of J.B. Hunt. ""She's done an incredible job representing trucking companies of all sizes our state and our entire industry. As the driving force behind the Arkansas Trucking Association Shannon has a unique way of getting us all -- drivers businesses legislators etc. -- to work together and support the front line of our industry as they safely deliver the goods and products that keep America moving.""

DOGWOOD

A Benton neighborhood called Dogwood was Newton's home from ""second grade all the way through high school.""

Newton is the oldest of three siblings growing up in her house. Newton's mother was a nurse and her father was involved in various ways in the car business. Her first memory?

""I can recall having a Snoopy record player that I would carry around"" Newton says. ""I had those little discs you would play you know 45s. I've always been into music. This was in the early '80s so I am pretty sure I was listening to Olivia Newton-John and Michael Jackson. I've always entertained myself with music.""

Saying she was into ""traditional things"" such as ""dolls and Barbies"" Newton also admits that her outdoor activities were limited.

""I don't like to get dirty and I am pretty risk averse"" Newton says.

With both of her parents working Newton notes that her father was an only child and so her grandparents were very involved in her upbringing.

""My grandparents would pick us up from school"" Newton recalls. ""They would always take us to get a Frosty after school. They were like a third parent. They always enjoyed being around me and my brother and sister.""

Newton says she can be ""painfully introverted"" but this trait did not hinder her in the classroom.

""I always enjoyed school"" Newton says. ""I was put in the gifted and talented program in school. I was always in the advanced classes. I am extremely competitive. Anytime there [was] a ranking system I was very motivated not to be left out of the top of that.""

Even as a member of a family that was into the Arkansas Razorbacks enough to have season tickets and having an athletic brother and sister Newton says sports were not her strong suit.

""I was slow and short and there aren't a lot of opportunities for someone slow and short"" Newton notes. ""So in high school I switched to dance and I was on the high school dance team. Then I grew six inches.""

Calling her days in high school ""fun"" Newton wasn't one who would spend a lot of time in a counselor's office trying to figure out what she wanted to do once high school was over.

""I'm one of those rare kids"" Newton says. ""I'm a firstborn and a planner. I decided I was going into accounting. I did well in math and science and didn't do as well in English. I enjoyed those math classes and liked [that] there is a right and wrong answer. I knew I was going to get a degree in accounting. I know that everybody isn't like that.""

RECRUITED

Though a lot of Newton's friends went to Fayetteville for college she decided on the University of Central Arkansas as it was ""closer to home.""

It was in a UCA Composition 1 class where Newton would meet the young man she would eventually marry.

""[Josh] played basketball at UCA"" Newton says. ""We did not date for several years. We had mutual interests in sports and things of that nature. He is a really smart nerd. I like that.""

For Newton college didn't present a greater degree of difficulty compared to high school. She would end up with a double major in accounting and computer information systems. She has obvious pride in earning a scholarship to UCA out of high school.

""I maintained my grade point average to get eight semesters of free school"" Newton says. ""I didn't have the college debt I hear my friends talk about. I'm very glad I didn't have to carry that forward. I certainly appreciate that.""

While Newton considers herself a hard-core planner she didn't have an exact idea of where her dual major was going to take her after graduation day. A job in the trucking industry wasn't on Newton's radar. There was no family connection to trucking and no one close to her recommended looking for a job in that field.

""I met a recruiter for Maverick Transportation on campus and we hit it off"" Newton recalls. ""I had no preconceived notions about the trucking industry. But I was really sold on the people I met there. I liked the environment and having a job there meant I would stay in the Central Arkansas area. That appealed to me.""

Newton's job at Maverick was in the payroll department.

""I was a backup to the driver payroll manager"" Newton says. ""As a 23-year-old fresh out of college I was put in front of new-hire truck drivers. It certainly challenged me to stand up in front of a room of drivers to explain to them our procedures as they came on board.""

ON THE ROAD

Fast-forward to her current role.

""It's a nonprofit trade association"" says Newton of the Arkansas Trucking Association. ""We have 330 members and most of those are the trucking companies. We have very big companies like J.B. Hunt to someone in rural Arkansas who is running 20 trucks.""

As president Newton compares running the Trucking Association to running a small business. Interestingly most of the positions in Newton's office are staffed by women.

""Yes the trucking industry is overwhelmingly dominated by men and our association staff is predominantly female"" Newton says. ""However we are not a trucking company we are a trade association. So it is not as odd as it may seem to have women employed in roles supporting public relations communication meetings events and continuing education.""

Newton says the pandemic has put a big bright spotlight back on trucks and the trucking industry.

""When we were in our homes we all ordered up various things to be delivered"" Newton says. ""We couldn't have experiences but we could order stuff. So we needed our stuff and we wanted it tomorrow. All of that was dependent on trucks and put an emphasis on transportation of goods.""

Trucking companies were dealing with this increase in demand while at the same time a serious labor crunch was only beginning.

""Driver shortage has been an issue as long as I have been in the industry"" Newton says. ""When the economy is bad we have just enough drivers. When the economy is good we struggle. If you overlay that with how every other employer is having a hard time finding workers then you know what we are facing.""

There are a number of solutions Newton believes can address this issue for the trucking industry.

""The easy part is to raise the awareness for the public about the importance of trucking for the state"" Newton says. ""The statistic we have is that trucking and the industries that support trucking provide one in 11 jobs in Arkansas.""

As for Newton 42 she is clearly comfortable in what she does and in being an advocate to legislators and others on why trucking matters. Being one of the few females in a prominent position in the trucking industry is not much of a concern for Newton.

That environment is the same as one of Newton's nonwork passions.

""I play fantasy football"" Newton says. ""I have been in a league for 10 years. I'm the only girl in the league.""

Studying statistics and using that to decide which players to pick for a team is right in Newton's wheelhouse. Newton's fantasy team is Vicki Vallencourt which is the name for the female nemesis of Adam Sandler's character in the film ""The Waterboy."" Newton doesn't just play for fun. She indicates that she's won the league trophy a couple of times.

""If there is scoring and I can win then I want to play.""

Meanwhile Northwest Arkansas Council and other local organizations began hosting mass vaccination clinics again in response to the surge.

Washington Regional will require all medical and allied health staff members students clinical rotators and volunteers to be vaccinated by Oct. 1 according to a memo from President and CEO Larry Shackelford to staff. Effective immediately all prospective new hires must provide proof of having received at least one dose of vaccine two weeks before beginning work the memo states.

Accommodation requests for exemptions based on disability and religious beliefs will be considered on a case-by-case basis the memo states.

Arkansas Children's Hospital including the Northwest Arkansas campus in Springdale decided all leaders must receive a first dose of the vaccine by Aug. 20 and be fully vaccinated by Sept. 30 as a condition of employment according to an email to staff. More than 90% of those in management positions at the hospital are vaccinated the email states.

Beginning Aug. 16 all new employees at Arkansas Children's must receive a first dose by their start date and a second dose within 30 days of employment the email states. The hospital will continue to comply with its policy of accommodating religious and medical exceptions.

Mercy Health Systems and Medical Associates of Northwest Arkansas announced plans earlier this month to require all staff members to be vaccinated by Sept. 30.

Increasing cases

The number of covid-19 hospitalizations in Northwest Arkansas and the state continued to climb this week peaking at 93 on Wednesday before falling to 87 Friday according to Martine Pollard a spokeswoman for Mercy who released a joint statement from the largest health care providers in the region.

The average age for covid-19 patients in Benton and Washington county hospitals was 58 with the youngest among them 21. Almost all of the hospitalized patients were not vaccinated Pollard said.

Mercy Hospital in Fort Smith had 22 covid-19 patients including 10 in ICU according to spokeswoman Jennifer Cook.

Baptist Health in Forth Smith had 35 patients with covid-19 including nine patients in ICU and four on ventilators according to Kim Miller western region president. Out of those only three were fully vaccinated she said.

Statewide 871 patients were hospitalized with covid-19 328 were in intensive care units and 159 were on ventilators according to Danyelle McNeill public information officer for the Arkansas Department of Health.

The department reported 1987 new cases in the state Friday including 218 in Benton County and 162 in Washington County.

Ten more covid-related deaths occurred in Benton County this week bringing the total for the year to 137 according to Coroner Daniel Oxford. Washington County had six new covid-related deaths bringing the July total to 19 and the total for the year to 172 according to Janell Smith deputy coroner.

Sebastian County has recorded 17 covid-related deaths in July including five residents of Crawford County five from Oklahoma one from Missouri and one from Franklin County according to Coroner Kenneth Hobbs. Many patients from surrounding areas come to Fort Smith hospitals for treatment he said.

Vaccine clinics

Northwest Arkansas Council hosted a vaccine clinic this week for the first time since June according to spokesman Nate Green.

On Friday 150 people attended the pop-up clinic at J.B. Hunt in Lowell he said. The clinic offered Pfizer vaccines for anyone over age 12.

The council suspended clinics in June because of lack of participation and started back this week because of the rising number of cases Green said.

The council is happy to work with businesses and other organizations to host pop-up clinics he said. More information is available on the council's website at nwacouncil.org/nwavaccines/.

A total of 144 people participated in a Bentonville School District vaccination clinic for students and community members on Monday according to spokeswoman Leslee Wright. It was the district's fourth clinic she said. Fayetteville High School hosted a vaccination clinic for students ages 12 and older on Friday.

Rogers School District is encouraging vaccinations for students but has not hosted a clinic for students since the shots are widely available in the community said Ashley Siwiec director of communications.

Trent Jones director of communications for Springdale School District said the district has not hosted a clinic and isn't planning to host one.

Arkansas United announced Friday plans for a series of school supply giveaway and vaccination events across the state including one from 8-11 a.m. Sunday at 614 E. Emma Ave. in Springdale; other such events are scheduled for Aug. 13 in Fort Smith and Aug. 15 in Springdale. Participants are asked to register by calling 479-763-2822.

Tami Marks a senior at Fayetteville High School receives the first shot of the Pfizer vaccine Friday July 23 2021 from Kyle Spicer a nurse with Nurses Crushing Covid inside the Bulldog Lobby at Fayetteville High School. The Fayetteville Public Schools' free covid-19 vaccination clinic was held for ages 12 and up. A second dose clinic will be held Friday August 13 at the school.

JKHY,Jack Henry & Associates,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9hbmFseXN0LWVzdGltYXRlcy1oZXJlcy1icm9rZXJzLXRoaW5rLTExNDUyNzY2MC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Analyst Estimates: Here's What Brokers Think Of Jack Henry & Associates Inc. (NASDAQ:JKHY) After Its Third-Quarter ...,"It's been a good week for Jack Henry & Associates Inc. (NASDAQ:JKHY) shareholders because the company has just released its latest quarterly results and the shares gained 4.0% to US$169. It was a credible result overall with revenues of US$539m and statutory earnings per share of US$1.19 both in line with analyst estimates showing that Jack Henry & Associates is executing in line with expectations. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. We thought readers would find it interesting to see the analysts latest (statutory) post-earnings forecasts for next year.

Check out our latest analysis for Jack Henry & Associates

Taking into account the latest results the current consensus from Jack Henry & Associates' 15 analysts is for revenues of US$2.37b in 2025. This would reflect a solid 8.4% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to ascend 11% to US$5.75. Before this earnings report the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$2.38b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$5.74 in 2025. So it's pretty clear that although the analysts have updated their estimates there's been no major change in expectations for the business following the latest results.

The analysts reconfirmed their price target of US$181 showing that the business is executing well and in line with expectations. The consensus price target is just an average of individual analyst targets so - it could be handy to see how wide the range of underlying estimates is. The most optimistic Jack Henry & Associates analyst has a price target of US$200 per share while the most pessimistic values it at US$170. Even so with a relatively close grouping of estimates it looks like the analysts are quite confident in their valuations suggesting Jack Henry & Associates is an easy business to forecast or the the analysts are all using similar assumptions.

Taking a look at the bigger picture now one of the ways we can understand these forecasts is to see how they compare to both past performance and industry growth estimates. The period to the end of 2025 brings more of the same according to the analysts with revenue forecast to display 6.7% growth on an annualised basis. That is in line with its 7.1% annual growth over the past five years. By contrast our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in a similar industry are forecast to see their revenues grow 3.6% per year. So it's pretty clear that Jack Henry & Associates is forecast to grow substantially faster than its industry.

Story continues

The Bottom Line

The most obvious conclusion is that there's been no major change in the business' prospects in recent times with the analysts holding their earnings forecasts steady in line with previous estimates. Fortunately they also reconfirmed their revenue numbers suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Additionally our data suggests that revenue is expected to grow faster than the wider industry. The consensus price target held steady at US$181 with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets.

Following on from that line of thought we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings. At Simply Wall St we have a full range of analyst estimates for Jack Henry & Associates going out to 2026 and you can see them free on our platform here..

Jacobs previously said he wouldn't rule out plastic surgery in 2010. ""I look at Tom [Ford] and he looks great"" he told GQ. ""Whatever he's doing works for him. And I don't know if he does anything but I'm not opposed. Whatever makes me feel good I want more of.""

He previously had to have work done on his nose following a run-in with a glass door admitting of his post-op face ""I thought this is so hot.""

The Disconnect actor opened up last year about how lockdown and the COVID-19 pandemic encouraged him to be ""unashamed"" to be himself as he launched his YouTube beauty vlog.

""If [there's] one thing I've learned early on in quarantine: Why not? Why not paint your face? Why not get dressed? Why not parade around in your underwear? Why not dance naked?"" he mused in the video. ""Why not enjoy this time that I have?

Earlier this week the fashion designer first debuted his new look after his recent procedure from celebrity plastic surgeon Dr. Andrew Jacono.

In an earlier Instagram snap from inside a hyperbaric oxygen trailer meant to help him speed up healing Jacobs put his strong jaw lifted browline and higher cheekbones on full display for his 1.6 million followers to check out.

Marc also included some commentary in his tags as well writing: '#doctorsorders #feeltheheal #yesIamokay #he'sgotthatBenjaminButtons #roadtorecovery.'

The scene looked like something from science fiction as Jacobs laid down inside a glass tube clad in patient scrubs and holding a bottle of water.

According to Hyperbaric Medical Solutions' website Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy 'is an all-natural non-invasive treatment where a patient simply breathes 100% medical-grade oxygen at an increased atmospheric pressure.'

'HBOT can increase the oxygen concentration in the body by up to 1200% —this gives it the potential to lead to extraordinary health benefits.'

Approved: Famous friends like Naomi Campbell and Lisa Rinna flocked to the comment section to compliment Marc's makeover

The high-tech looking healing strategy is more accessible than it appears. Oxygen therapy can be covered by insurance and without coverages costs can range between $250 to $450 a session.

Famous friends flocked to the comment section to compliment Marc's makeover.

Supermodel Naomi Campbell posted a wide-eyed emoji saying: 'Happy safe Healing can't wait to see the unveiling.'

Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills star Lisa Rinna called her pal: 'Fresh as a f***ing daisy.'

Keeping it real: Marc first revealed on Instagram that he got a facelift sharing a photo of himself covered in bandages at the doctor's office on Tuesday

Photographer/longtime personal assistant Nicolas Newbold called his friend 'Benjamin Button' while drag queen Miss Fame said 'I love' with fire emojis.

Makeup artist Fulvia Farolfi offered hearts and applause through emojis.

Jacobs first revealed that he underwent a facelift while proudly sharing a photo of bandages wrapped around his head post-surgery on Wednesday.

The designer posted a selfie that he snapped at his doctor's office which he captioned: 'Yesterday' along with the hashtags: '#f*ckgravity' '#livelovelift' and '#DrJacono' — a reference to celebrity plastic surgeon Dr. Andrew Jacono.

Big money: Dr. Jacono (pictured) charges $50000 for his 'deep plane facelifts' which he claims last longer than traditional facelifts. It's unclear how much Jacobs' facelift cost

The image shows layers of white gauze wrapped around his head and drainage bags filled with blood and fluid on each side of his ears. He is wearing a face mask leaving only his brows and eyes visible to the camera.

Jacobs confirmed he had a deep plane facelift.

The New York-based surgeon previously worked his magic on Botched doctor Paul Nassif and Real Housewives of New York City star Sonja Morgan who both had him perform their facelifts.

Nassif's 'deep plane facelift' cost a whopping $50000 while Morgan's face and neck lift totaled $75000.

It's unclear how much Jacobs paid for his surgery but he likely spent around $50000 as Dr. Jacono favors the deep plane method.

Before: Jacobs shared this selfie just a few days before he shared that he went under the knife

Jacobs who is known for his youthful appearance and ripped physique is no stranger to physical transformation. Just two years shy of his 60th birthday he looks completely different than he did as a young designer.

Back in the 1990s the New York native began his fashion career by designing for sportswear label Perry Ellis. While he did not show off his body in those days even under clothes he appeared visibly less muscular than he is now and his tattoos were not yet apparent.

In 1992 Jacobs showed his 'grunge' collection for the label. To reflect the times as well as his collection he sported long shaggy hair a broody stare and baggy clothes — a far cry from his trim polished look now.

'I never took care of my appearance. I was like 'Who cares? I'm in the studio 16 hours a day and nobody sees me'' he recalled in a 2010 interview with Harper's Bazaar.

Youthful: Jacobs already looked just as young as his 40-year-old husband Charly 'Char' Defrancesco. The couple is pictured in 2019

He went from 21 percent to 5 percent body fat by following the advice of a nutritionist who told him to cut out caffeine sugar white flour and dairy and to exercise every day.

The designer who had rarely set foot in a gym scrubbed up began sporting a buzz cut and grew out his stubble marking the beginning of his transformation into how he looks today.

Jacobs has been talking about getting plastic surgery for years telling GQ in 2008 that he was open to it.

'I look at Tom [Ford] and he looks great. Whatever he’s doing works for him' he said. 'And I don’t know if he does anything but I’m not opposed. Whatever makes me feel good I want more of.'

He added that he had already gone under the knife to thicken the bridge of his nose after running into a glass door.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vZXZva2UuaWUvMjAyMS8wNy8yNC9zdHlsZS9kZXNpZ25lci1tYXJjLWphY29icy1zaG93cy1vZmYtcmVzdWx0cy1vZi1oaXMtZmFjZWxpZnQtaW4tZHJhbWF0aWMtd2F50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Designer Marc Jacobs Shows Off Results Of His Facelift In Dramatic Way,"Marc Jacobs has made a show-stopping reveal but it was not on the runway.

The American fashion designer has gone under the knife to get a facelift with the New York-based celebrity plastic surgeon Dr Andrew Jacono documenting the gruesome proces every step of the way.

Today's top videos

The 58-year-old creative lifted the lid on his glow up as he posted a series of work-in-progress pictures on his Instagram.

The first image was a post-op selfie which showed him wearing a surgical mask with his head wrapped thickly with gauze and grizzly-looking drainage tubes protruding filled with blood.

Tagging his plastic surgeon in the caption he announced proudly: ‘#f*ckgravity’ and ‘#livelovelift’.

Many fans took to the comment section to applaud his transparency around going under the knife but that wasn't the end of the show.

The irreverent designer gave the world the first glimpse at his brand new face in standout fashion as he posted a picture from a hyperbaric oxygen chamber which is a treatment used to speed up healing especially stubborn wound though breathing pure oxygen in a pressurised environment.

'Getting my oxygen on' he announced in the caption of his facelift reveal as the picture showed him dressed in surgical robes and wrapped up in a blanket staring out from the chamber mid-treatment.

According to the company Hyperbaric Oxygen Solutions hyperbaric oxygen therapy is 'an all-natural non-invasive treatment' which allows patients to breath 100 per cent medical-grade oxygen at increased atmospheric pressure.

The high-tech healing treatment can speed up the levels of oxygen concentration in the body by a whopping 1200 per cent to boast 'extraordinary health benefits' including body tissue regeneration decreased inflammation and inflammatory proteins and the promotion of stem cell mobilisation.

To sit back relax breathe and heal a lot faster a session can set you back anywhere between $250 to $400.

Famous friends and fans alike have wished the designer a speedy recovery posting in the comments section following the next-level reveal.

? Happy safe Healing @themarcjacobs can’t get wait to see the unveiling ❤️❤️❤️’ said supermodel Naomi Campbell.

'Fresh as a fu*king daisy ?' exclaimed Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Lisa Rinna.

While another fan called him: 'Benjamin Button.'"

They were right.

Johnson’s first year in office has been a roller coaster ride filled with the ups of having delivered on a checklist of progressive promises — and the downs of managing contentious relationships with Gov. J.B. Pritzker the Illinois General Assembly the business community and police.

There’s even mounting tension with a City Council emboldened by Johnson’s failure to deliver on his signature promise to secure a new revenue source to combat homelessness.

In an interview with the Sun-Times and WBEZ Johnson reflected on his “remarkable journey” to the mayor’s office and the very “different trajectory” he followed to get there.

He’s proud of fulfilling so many items on his progressive to-do list and described a year of accomplishments tempered by impatience.

“There are frustrating moments that I do have where you … just wish you could address everything at the same time” Johnson said. “That’s just unfortunately not where we are — just because the damage has been so severe and it has been so widespread” especially in “historically marginalized” communities.

Johnson acknowledged he hasn’t made everybody happy but that comes with the turf.

“If the role of the mayor is to satisfy everyone then we would not have had 56 prior to me” Johnson said.

Migrant crisis missteps

From the beginning Johnson has been dogged by the migrant crisis he inherited. One of his first Council meetings included a cathartic vote on $51 million in surplus funding for the crisis — after a contentious “us-versus-them” debate that reduced one alderperson to tears.

Johnson’s handling of the crisis telegraphed the freshman mayor’s growing pains. He unveiled plans for a winterized camp at a contaminated Southwest Side industrial site only to have Pritzker reject the idea amid environmental concerns.

The local alderperson a progressive ally felt blindsided by the mayor’s plan and was subsequently physically accosted by furious constituents.

The abandoned plan ended up costing Chicago taxpayers nearly $1 million.

But Johnson succeeded in emptying Chicago police station lobbies filled with asylum-seekers and returning Park District field houses to their intended use. He did that by opening brick-and-mortar shelters at a furious pace. At its peak 27 shelters held more than 14600 migrants.

“When I stepped into office … you had contracts that were bloated and it was costing the taxpayers an enormous amount of dollars ... . We’ve transformed all of that. … We’ve saved the taxpayers over $200 million dollars” Johnson said.

But the biggest shelter in Pilsen was crowded and unsanitary. A 5-year-old boy there died of sepsis and it later was the epicenter for a measles outbreak.

Aldermen are now pushing back on the mayor’s 60-day eviction policy — which was delayed three times and already has forced more than 650 people from shelter.

Johnson also stumbled by initially reneging on a deal with Pritzker and Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle one of his political patrons to provide $70 million in additional city funding to support migrants through 2024.

His first budget included just $150 million in funding he knew would last only until April 1. He deliberately low-balled the figure to put pressure on the federal government but the tactic failed. At one point he used $95 million in federal stimulus to slap an end-of-year Band-Aid on the migrant crisis. But that alienated some alderpersons who control spending and were not consulted.

Johnson’s hand-picked chair of the Council’s Immigrant and Refugee Rights Committee has frequently complained about being shut out of conversations around the migrant crisis including about the mayor’s eviction policy. Ald. Andre Vasquez (40th) eventually strong-armed the administration into publishing regular data on evictions.

“There needs to be some work done as it relates to transparency and accountability as well as cooperation and engagement and dialogue with the alders” Vasquez said. “It’s about figuring out how to engage with everybody.”

Alderpersons’ grievances with Johnson were on full display at the last Council meeting where they called for the mayor to be more forthright about migrant funding and equal spending on long disinvested communities.

Even after the griping the Council ultimately passed two of Johnson’s top spending priorities including $70 million from city reserves for migrant spending to honor the deal with Pritzker and Preckwinkle.

“I know how to count and both those votes received more than 30 votes from City Council” said Workforce Development Chair Ald. Mike Rodriguez (22nd). “That sounds like a win to me.”

After closing nearly a dozen shelters amid declining numbers Johnson said he’s “preparing” for a possible influx of migrants in the run-up to the Democratic National Convention in August. But there are “limitations to what we can do” without more federal help he said.

Progress on progressive wish list

Johnson’s legislative successes have been impressive.

In the first year alone he has: phased out the subminimum wage for tipped workers; pushed through the most generous paid leave policy in the country; reinstated the city’s Department of Environment; and laid the groundwork to reopen two shuttered mental health clinics.

The mayor has also begun to ease the pressure on Chicago police officers by expanding a plan to send mental health providers instead of police to nonviolent mental health emergencies.

Johnson kept his promise to put a binding referendum on the ballot that would have authorized the Council to increase the real estate transfer tax to create a dedicated funding source for homelessness prevention. But Chicago voters rejected it a major defeat widely viewed as a referendum on the mayor’s first year in office.

Mayoral allies in the progressive caucus heard the message loud and clear and vowed to work harder to win voters’ trust and simplify a complicated referendum that many voters didn’t understand.

“Ignoring what those critiques are and thinking that we’re just morally right isn’t going to lead to future wins” Vasquez said.

At the time Johnson responded to the defeat with bravado warning anyone who might assume one defeat would make him put the brakes on his progressive agenda to “buckle up.”

More recently the mayor won Council approval for a $1.25 billion bond issue devised by former Mayor Lori Lightfoot to fund housing and economic development programs. The same goes for Lightfoot’s plan which Johnson expanded to transform nearly vacant buildings along LaSalle Street into more affordable residential units.

Canceling the city’s contract with the gunshot detection technology company known as ShotSpotter also delivered on a progressive promise. Johnson and his base have long viewed ShotSpotter as a surveillance tool that leads to over-policing in Black and Brown communities.

But Johnson’s decision was somewhat overshadowed by his delivery. He announced it just days before the contract was to expire then scrambled to negotiate an extension through the historically violent summer months and the Democratic National Convention.

ShotSpotter and the broken migrant funding promise with Pritzker and Preckwinkle were the subject of a disastrous Feb. 15 press conference showcasing a communication problem dominating his first year in office.

He evaded some questions answered in platitudes and declined to say if he’d walked away from a migrant funding deal with Pritzker and Preckwinkle or nailed down the ShotSpotter extension before announcing a phase-out.

That defining moment in his relationship with the press seems to have led to a course correction. Johnson finally named a permanent communications director in Ronnie Reese who had essentially filled the role since Johnson took office. Johnson also hired a chief strategy officer Joe Calvello who learned the art of being “radically open and honest” while guiding U.S. Sen. John Fetterman D-Pa. through a difficult campaign dominated by health issues.

Calvello appears to have made an impact already persuading Johnson to take media questions more often and answer those questions a bit more directly.

Mixed bag for business

Johnson’s aggressive agenda such as the costly mandates on paid leave and the subminimum wage put him at odds with the business community.

But labor leaders said Johnson also had displayed a willingness to compromise on both issues even as business groups kept “moving the goalposts.”

“They were looking not to compromise. They’re just looking to stop the policy. And that’s not realistic” Chicago Federation of Labor President Bob Reiter said noting similar policies have been adopted by other major cities.

Johnson also appeared to extend an olive branch with recent rollouts of pro-development policies. And his choice of seasoned real estate executive Ciere Boatright as commissioner of Planning and Development also was applauded by the business community.

Besides the LaSalle Street plan he proposed recommendations to cut bureaucratic red tape on business development and revived the long-stalled O’Hare expansion project by hammering out a cost-cutting deal with the major airlines.

Johnson also held the line on city property taxes — though he allowed Chicago Public Schools to boost property taxes to the limit two years in a row.

“It’s been a little bit up and down. Some positives. Some negatives” Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce President Jack Lavin said of Johnson’s first year adding that there’s “a lot of work to be done to improve communication” and trust between the mayor and the business community.

“He has a tax agenda. We have ideas on how we can grow the economy. And we’re going to have to come together because federal money is drying up. There’s lots of fiscal cliffs and fiscal challenges coming up” Lavin said.

“He’s the mayor. We’ve all got to work together. If the mayor is not successful Chicago’s not going to be successful.”

With two of four city employee pension funds hovering perilously close to insolvency Johnson has displayed some financial acumen by continuing a Lightfoot policy of making additional payments. He also appointed a working group to study the $35 billion crisis — but it has yet to produce any ideas on solving it.

Goodwill from police short-lived

Johnson’s choice of Larry Snelling as police superintendent played to rave reviews. A commanding and reassuring presence he’s already won the support of the demoralized rank and file.

The mayor also extended the police contract and sweetened police raises. But the feel-good period was somewhat short-lived.

He infuriated officers by twice asking Council members to reject an arbitrator’s ruling allowing officers accused of the most serious wrongdoing to bypass the Police Board taking their cases to arbitration.

“For a Democratic mayor to be so anti-union it’s pretty breathtaking” said Fraternal Order of Police President John Catanzara.

As expected a judge sided with the union — but agreed to make the arbitration process more public and that meant the back-to-back Council votes were more than “symbolic” Johnson said.

Johnson did keep a campaign promise to hire 200 new detectives and free officers for street duty by hiring civilians to perform office jobs. And to the consternation of some progressive allies he increased the police budget to nearly $1.99 billion.

Still Snelling told a town hall in Jefferson Park recently that Chicago remains down about 2000 officers citywide and struggles with low recruitment.

Like Lightfoot Johnson has devised a plan to get at the root causes of crime. His hyperlocal version focuses on 10 multi-block areas in four neighborhoods: Englewood Austin Little Village and West Garfield Park.

Those neighborhoods — plagued by school closings and high dropout rates while lacking public amenities like parks and libraries — will receive an array of services including priority in another round of the city’s guaranteed minimum income program.

Johnson has also put a heavy focus on creating more summer jobs and neighborhood recreational opportunities for young people to give them alternatives to an ongoing trend of mass downtown gatherings that have turned violent.

Shootings and homicides are down slightly but robberies remain stubbornly high. In neighborhoods citywide Chicagoans continue to feel unsafe waking up to reports of another wave of strong-armed robberies store break-ins and carjackings.

Reducing violent crime remains such a priority alderpersons who believe ShotSpotter is an effective prevention tool vow to perhaps symbolically defy the mayor and tie his hands on ending the contract.

Johnson plays Council tie-breaker

Twice in the first year Johnson was forced to cast tie-breaking Council votes: to save his now-ousted Zoning Chair and floor leader Ald. Carlos Ramirez-Rosa (35th) from censure; and to approve a nonbinding resolution for a cease-fire in the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.

The cease-fire resolution strained Johnson’s relationship with many Jewish leaders and the only Jewish alderperson Debra Silverstein (50th). Some Jewish elected officials and civic leaders — including the Anti-Defamation League Midwest state Sen. Sara Feigenholtz and state Rep. Bob Morgan — later declined the mayor’s invitation to a recent meeting meant to ease the tension.

But not supporting the resolution would have diminished his relationships with progressives and Arab Americans. He noted calling for a cease-fire is in line with his values and that several progressive pro-Palestinian Jewish groups did attend the meeting.

“As far as me calling for peace I hardly consider that controversial. ... The entire country and people around the world are calling for that. That’s something that we value as residents of the city of Chicago but it’s also part of our responsibility as global residents that calling for peace and an end to war is a part of our very profound tradition” he said.

The Chicago area’s large Palestinian community demanded for months that Johnson and his Council majority take a stand voicing their feelings at numerous raucous Council meetings.

The division caused by the war has spread to college campuses in Chicago and nationwide foreshadowing the civil disobedience that might occur when Democrats gather here in August to formally nominate President Joe Biden for reelection.

If Johnson is too timid he risks allowing demonstrators to run roughshod over Chicago. If he allows Chicago police to be too heavy-handed he runs the risk of civil rights violations and the inevitable comparison to the disaster of the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago.

Chief of staff Rich Guidice a seasoned City Hall lifer was widely expected to serve through the convention bringing the expertise garnered from guiding Chicago through decades of major events. But Guidice abruptly resigned last month.

The tie-breaking vote that spared Ramirez-Rosa from censure followed his resignation from leadership after apologizing for bullying and threatening colleagues to block a symbolic referendum on whether Chicago should remain a sanctuary city.

Johnson has yet to name a replacement for Ramirez-Rosa — either as Zoning chair or floor leader. Some Council members are demanding a replacement from the Latino Caucus but Johnson has yet to find someone he trusts who can also win alderpersons’ support.

Meanwhile some of Johnson’s progressive supporters believe rushing to force Ramirez-Rosa’s resignation went too far and that an apology should have sufficed.

Backing Bears puzzles progressives

Progressives were also left scratching their heads when Johnson embraced the Bears’ plan for a sprawling domed stadium south of Soldier Field — a project requiring billions of state and federal dollars that haven’t been approved or identified.

When the Bears unveiled their stadium plan Johnson acted more like a cheerleader than a guardian of taxpayers and protector of precious lakefront parkland.

Asked if the plan violated the city ordinance prohibiting new construction along the lakefront Johnson referred to the Bears’ promise of increased green space on the Museum Campus. But he failed to mention that those additional 14 acres are possible only if the state and federal governments cover all $1.5 billion in infrastructure costs.

Putting the Bears stadium near the top of his legislative wish list contradicts Johnson’s campaign stance. Now though Johnson calls Soldier Field a “100-year-old building” — even though it was rebuilt in 2003. Paying off what’s owed on that renovation will drain city coffers unless the debt is refinanced in the new stadium funding package.

“If someone else has another solution that addresses this problem then they should put that on the table” Johnson said.

Every mayor loves a giant public works project. They generate jobs contracts and political donations and are a feel-good diversion from Chicago’s intransigent problems. Then-Mayor Richard M. Daley had his failed 2016 Olympic bid. Former Mayor Rahm Emanuel had Elon Musk’s high-speed tunnel train to O’Hare Airport.

Johnson’s stadium plan similarly appears to be going nowhere. Springfield has far higher priorities.

“The position he’s taking there … seems to run at odds with his key base of support from progressives. I understand the temptation and desire to put forward a signature project — a legacy project if you will. … But it just seems like an unforced error in the way he rolled it out” said David Greising president and CEO of the Better Government Association.

“Unforced errors is sort of a common theme that we are seeing in many respects. … Communication with the public and the press remains lacking.”

At the Bears’ announcement “he’s speaking in platitudes from scripted remarks and can’t really engage with the questions being asked” Greising said which is “undermining his ability to earn support from people most affected by the decisions he is making.”

Pritzker did not address the Bears stadium controversy or other points of tension with Johnson saying instead: “The first year of any administration is often the most challenging and I commend Mayor Johnson and his team for reaching this milestone.”

Springfield stumbles

A stadium defeat would not be Johnson’s first in Springfield.

Last month the Illinois House voted 92-8 to approve a bill curbing the power of Johnson’s revamped hand-picked school board. A Senate committee did the same this past week during Johnson’s first Springfield lobbying trip as mayor. The bill would prevent Chicago Public Schools from making any admissions or funding changes to selective-enrollment programs and from closing any schools until a fully elected school board takes control in early 2027.

There was no mistaking the message to Johnson’s board which wants to prioritize investing in neighborhood schools over choice schools like selective enrollments. The original bill was amended to extend an existing moratorium on closing all schools and not just selective schools after lobbying by the CTU.

Asked what message he took from the vote to tie his hands on an important education issue Johnson noted it still needs final approval.

“It’s not a law so nothing has happened” he said.

An emotional CTU President Stacy Davis Gates — perhaps reflecting on setbacks like these — told supporters last fall she was “ashamed of myself” for having helped put Johnson — “my brother” she called him — in “an impossible place.”

Asked recently what she was ashamed of Davis Gates talked about the resistance Johnson has faced during his first year.

“Transformation is happening right now in Chicago and every corner of the city because of his leadership. And that level of transformation either makes you a hero or it makes you a villain” Davis Gates said. “It’s not lukewarm. It’s either hot or cold and that is a very precarious position to live in.”

Remaking Chicago Public Schools

As a candidate Johnson promised to make progressive changes to CPS and has.

His revamped board is led by former science teacher Jianan Shi who also led the parent advocacy group Raise Your Hand for Illinois Public Education. Johnson’s board is filled with others with community organizing experience.

That board has delivered on a promise to shift away from student-based budgeting that progressives argue exacerbates challenges at schools serving low-income communities and toward a need-based funding model.

But he’s already disappointed some parents by sticking with a plan for a phased-in elected school board instead of delivering that pivotal reform in one fell swoop.

Johnson will also have to find a way to deliver for the schools parents and his former colleagues at the teachers union without breaking the bank in the CTU contract he is now negotiating. Teachers started out by demanding a 9% raise or to match inflation whichever is higher.

“I know what it takes — from a teacher’s perspective as well as a parent’s perspective and a student’s perspective–to have a more transformational educational experience” Johnson said. “And that’s what our focus has to be: funding our schools and actually transforming them so that they are fully fully expressed in an equitable way.”

CPS faces a $391 million deficit for the upcoming school year not including raises being negotiated for teachers and a 4% raise already promised to support staff. The CTA and other mass transit agencies are facing their own funding cliffs.

That’s another point of contention between Johnson and Pritzker.

The governor and others are demanding a leadership change at CTA before providing any new money. Others want to merge all four Chicago-area mass transit agencies into a single super-agency to reduce costs improve operations and create a uniform fare system.

Johnson harshly critical of CTA performance during the campaign has stuck with embattled CTA President Dorval Carter Jr. no favorite of Chicago alderpersons.

When Pritzker dared demand a leadership change the mayor replied that he alone gets to choose the CTA president adding “If people want to be mayor they should run for it.”

Room to grow into job

Johnson likes to say he intends to serve for 23 years — long enough to become Chicago’s longest-serving mayor bypassing Richard M. Daley.

But that will require him to grow and mature in the job and survive many upcoming tests. While his first budget made no real political waves the second will demand making cuts raising property taxes or finding new sources of revenue while still chipping away at his commitment to invest in people.

Despite Johnson’s gestures to the business community Greising said many business leaders he talks to “feel like they still don’t know him still don’t understand what he’s trying to do and what they can do for him — and still don’t feel heard by him.”

“Every successful mayor has found a way to have the business community with him. And this mayor so far doesn’t seem to work very hard on that” Greising said.

“We shouldn’t be all that surprised when we elect someone with his background that there’s a very steep learning curve. But … he really needs to invest his effort into growing in those areas where he is falling short. If he doesn’t do that with urgency then it will be too late.”

Davis Gates acknowledged the growing pains.

“For so long in this city people who have needed [the most] have been told ‘no’” she said. Now after years of “demanding a thing happens fighting for a thing to happen protesting rallying door knocking” progressives are in charge.

“To make things happen those are different muscles. ... The muscles that we have to develop now — not just as a movement not just as a mayor but as an entire city — is number one we’ve got to get more inclusive. We’ve got to figure out how to work past our differences.”

It will take some time for this “new formation that we have in Chicago” to settle in Johnson said.

“ The way these systems have been built particularly government they have been built in a very complex way to favor the few” he said.

“There has been sort of an unfettered access of a handful of powerful people having access to the fifth floor. … Maybe they’re not used to sharing. And that’s going to take them some adjustment.”

Mayor's up-and-down first year in office Mayor’s up-and-down first year in office • The migrant crisis has dominated much of Johnson’s first year: The crisis exposed the growing pains of a new mayor and exacerbated historic tensions between Chicago’s Black and Hispanic communities. One key setback: Johnson’s determination to locate a migrant camp at a contaminated industrial site in Brighton Park. Gov. J.B. Pritzker canceled that project over those environmental concerns.



• It’s been a mixed bag on progressives’ wish list: Johnson was able to get the Chicago City Council to eliminate the sub-minimum wage for tipped workers and require city employers to give their employees at least 10 paid days off a year. But voters rejected his “Bring Chicago Home” referendum which would have increased the real estate transfer tax and used the money to fund programs to reduce homelessness.



• His relationship with the business community has been rocky: He enacted those costly mandates on paid leave and the subminimum wage but also helped developers with an initiative to cut bureaucratic red tape and his decision to move forward on a plan to convert some LaSalle Street office buildings in the Loop for residential use. And he broke a stalemate with United and American airlines to reduce costs and move forward with a massive multi-billion-dollar expansion and renovation of O’Hare International Airport.



• Unease about Johnson’s inexperience was soothed by some of his early appointments: Rich Guidice a City Hall veteran recently retired from the Office of Emergency Management and Communications returned as Johnson’s chief of staff though he lasted less than a year. Seasoned real estate executive Ciere Boatright became commissioner of the city’s Planning and Development Department. And Johnson’s choice as police superintendent Larry Snelling had been with CPD for years and remains popular with the rank-and-file.



• Johnson spent some of his fragile political capital in casting tie-breaking votes in the Council: One was on a symbolic resolution calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. The mayor’s other tie-breaking vote was to save Ald. Carlos Ramirez-Rosa from censure. The alderperson Johnson’s floor leader was accused of bullying some fellow members.



• Every mayor loves a big jobs-creating public works project: Richard M. Daley had his Olympic bid Rahm Emanuel had his high-speed tunnel to O’Hare that Elon Musk was going to build. Johnson’s appears to be the Bears’ bid for a new lakefront domed stadium but jumping on board so soon when the level of public funding is so high — and still in doubt “seems like an unforced error” said David Greising president and CEO of the Better Government Association.



• Johnson’s experience as a teacher plays a role: Johnson a former organizer for the Chicago Teachers Union owes his election in part to the support of that union and entered office with teachers’ support. And while he has remade the CPS board — and the board has shifted schools to a need-based funding formula he also disappointed parents by backing away from shifting to an all-elected school board right away opting instead to phase in elected members.

The Volusia Sheriff’s Office Communications Center is speeding up response time and freeing up more dispatchers to answer 911 calls with a new automated system that responds to burglar fire and medical alarms instantly with no phone call required.

In its first full month implementation of the Automated Secure Alarm Protocol (ASAP) system already resulted in about 1200 fewer calls to VSO dispatchers who handle every 911 and nonemergency call for every law-enforcement fire and EMS service in Volusia County.

“If technology can help us provide better faster service we have to take advantage of it” Sheriff Mike Chitwood said of the new system which went live in May with the participation of major alarm companies across the U.S. “This will speed up our response to alarms and at the same time free up more dispatchers to take 911 calls that absolutely require a human being on the line.”

In the past alarm companies had to manually call the nonemergency line to report a home or business burglar fire or medical alarm activation. That meant a dispatcher had to answer the call receive the information and enter it into the Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) system.

With the new ASAP system the alarm notification is all electronic and all the information is automatically populated and entered in CAD.

The Volusia Sheriff’s Office was the 86th emergency communications center in the country to implement ASAP and the ninth in Florida.

The companies participating include ADT Stanley Security Rapid Response Monitoring Vector Security Security Central Securitas Tyco (Johnson Controls) Quick Response ADS (Nashville) Alert 360 Guardian Protection Affiliated Monitoring National Monitoring Center AT&T Digital Life Protection One Vivint and Brinks Home Security.

No action is required on the customer’s end and there is no additional cost for residents or businesses. Alarm companies will continue to contact home and business owners to notify them of any alarms.

Any customers who are unsure if their alarm service provider is participating in the new system should contact the provider.",,,,,,,,,

That began to change in 2018 when the bank embarked on a quest to open 400 bank branches in new markets in the United States and become the first American bank to have a presence in every state but Alaska and Hawaii.

Chase the U.S. consumer and commercial banking business of JP Morgan Chase & Co. opened the first of its planned five branch locations in Central Arkansas earlier this month one of more than 60 branches the bank has opened around the nation this year.

Chase's presence in Arkansas was mostly limited to credit card services. In Arkansas Chase has 350000 credit card holders. It also has 14000 business accounts in the state.

""As a credit card company we've been servicing people across the country for 20 years or more"" said Dan Deegan who has led the national expansion effort for Chase.

Deegan was in town last week to help mark the formal opening of the Chase branch at 12900 Chenal Parkway. He and other bank executives were welcomed by Little Rock Mayor Frank Scott Jr.

""As a former banker I know how important banks are to a local economy"" Scott said at a ribbon-cutting ceremony. ""You are job creators You are job sustainers.""

Investing in new buildings may appear old school with the covid-19 pandemic accelerating the public's move to online banking and with many banks closing or limiting access to their lobbies.

But physical locations continue to play an important role in banking Deegan said.

""Through covid people have had to embrace technology even faster than they thought they would. We've certainly seen that"" he said. ""But people still like the idea [of being] face-to-face with someone and ask the questions that are sometimes more complicated: 'I want to get a mortgage I want to get an auto loan I want to get the right checking account.'""

Still technology killed the traffic at bank branches.

""They don't need to come as frequently as they did five or 10 years ago to the bank"" Deegan said. ""Direct deposit probably being the most impactful thing that has changed foot traffic. But we still have almost a million customers a day coming to our footprint of branches nationwide.""

Chase has 4960 locations in 44 states including the branch on Chenal Parkway according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

Still the concept of a branch has adapted to 21st Century sensibilities. There's no big lobby dominated by teller windows. Instead there are just two teller windows now called transaction windows.

The branch has six offices around the central lobby area. Associate bankers greet customers a tablet computer in their hands for setting appointments and other services.

The branch has a total of four automated teller machines commonly called ATMs. One is for drive-thru customers and another is for walk-up customers. Two more are inside a preference Chase has detected among its customers.

The ATM options ""make banking easy and convenient"" said Kyle Rhodes the branch manager. ""Do what you want when you want.""

But even Rhodes a banking industry veteran made a jarring discovery on his first day at the branch involving the big walk-in vault. The branch didn't have one.

""No big wheel or big lever to turn or needing two people to push the door"" he said.

Chase has four other branches -- three more in Little Rock and one in North Little Rock -- in various stages of development or construction.

All are in high traffic areas. The Chenal Parkway branch is situated next to a Target and Home Depot.

Chase is scheduled to open new branch banks at Cantrell Road and Southridge Drive one in Midtown in Little Rock and one on East McCain Boulevard in North Little Rock. The fifth branch will be at Chenal Parkway and Kirk Road.

""Locations are critical for us"" Deegan said. ""Three key things drive the selection. We want to be near where you live where you work where you shop.

""Clearly with Target and Home Depot here this is a convenient place where people are shopping. Ideally if we could hit all three of those buckets that will be convenient to our customers.""

Technology is a feature that limits the expansion.

""Years ago we might have built more because people relied exclusively on branches"" Deegan said. ""Now they do a combination of both.""

Chase plans to use the expanded branch footprint to develop new business with existing customers.

""What we have found surprisingly is our credit card customers consider themselves Chase customers already"" Deegan said. ""They just didn't have the opportunity to do branch banking.

""What we do is literally reach out to them whether it's by phone email or letter just to let them know 'Hey we now have a branch in Little Rock. If you'd like to learn about other ways Chase can help you feel free to come in.'

""So far over 10% of the accounts we've opened at all the other branches have come from credit-card-only customers that were there already and then we introduced them to the branch.""

Longtime Chase customer Caitlyn Schmidt a California native who moved to Hot Springs earlier this year made arrangements to continue her California work on the Upwork freelancing platform but she said ""when it came time to transfer funds I was denied the transfer due to name mismatch by Upwork"" because she didn't change her name on the Chase account when she married.

The only way to change the name on her account was to visit a bank branch. Before the Little Rock branch opened the closest one was 400 miles away she said.

Word that Chase opened a branch in Little Rock as a result left her ""overjoyed.""

""I was eventually able to complete the name change and only drove about an hour away"" Schmidt said in an email.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzhhMzI4YWY0LWI4ZjItNDhjNS04MmE5LWQ3ZGMxYzM0NWUxY9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wall Street doubles down on lending 'cheap money' to the rich,"Try unlimited access Only MX$100 for 4 weeks

The corridor is in the midst of a $32 billion public and private investment spree according to Weitzman Associates an investment and development advisory firm — likely the most of any 17-block stretch in town.



More than $13 billion in public infrastructure work has been completed or soon will be of which the lion’s share is $11.2 billion for the MTA’s East Side Access — the underground eight-track terminal that will bring the Long Island Rail Road into Grand Central Terminal for the first time.



Nearly $19 billion is committed to ongoing or planned commercial development including the rising JP Morgan Chase tower at 270 Park Ave. ($4.04 billion) recently completed One Vanderbilt at 42nd Street ($3.32 billion) and the biggest of all — the proposed Project Commodore at 175 Park Ave. a 2.5 million-square-foot office and hotel skyscraper on a site that includes the now-closed Grand Hyatt Hotel.



“There have been more fashionable destinations over the years such as Flatiron. But at the end of the day Park Avenue is the central spine of East Midtown” said Weitzman principal and managing director Peter Bazeli. The firm has worked with several avenue office landlords over the years and is currently advising owner Dajia Insurance Group on its Waldorf-Astoria redevelopment project to be completed in 2023.



The landmarked Waldorf “occupying a whole city block will be “the focal point of Park Avenue glamor” when it reopens Bazeli added.



Park Avenue office tenants enjoy easy access to Grand Central’s Metro-North lines to the affluent northern suburbs and multiple subway lines and soon to the LIRR as well.

“With continued economic growth will come more demand for transit-oriented workspace Bazeli said. He noted that One Vanderbilt for example was “predicated on easy transit access” which developer SL Green enhanced with $220 million in new public entrances corridors and lobbies.



“If any segment of the Manhattan market is going to be resilient this is the location” Bazeli said.

Park Avenue seemed to be losing some luster to Sixth Avenue and downtown a few years ago especially when Wells Fargo left 250000 square feet at RFR’s 375 Park Ave. (the Seagram Building) for Hudson Yards. But Raymond James’ lease for 160000 square feet at Mutual of America’s 320 Park Ave. last summer lifted spirits.



The avenue’s renaissance is spurred in part by East Midtown’s rezoning which allows much larger buildings than previously permitted in exchange for developers’ commitment to pay for public streetscape and transit upgrades.



A stroll on the avenue today — still relatively quiet as office towers await the return of most employees — reveals only part of what’s happening. Obvious changes include the JPMorgan Chase tower’s rising steel and just-completed Foster + Partners-designed 425 Park Ave. Developed by L&L Holding Co. it will be home to Ken Griffin’s powerhouse financial firm Citadel.



Major auction house Phillips boasts a new much more visible home in the white-glass cube of 432 Park Avenue. Phillips CEO Edward Doman said “Thanks to studioMDA’s brilliant design our building marries the interior exterior and the piazza creating a sense of community in a bustling metropolis and engaging the millions of international passersby from the street level.”



Less obvious but equally important are significant upgrades in progress behind temporary plywood at avenue-straddling 230 Park Ave. (the one-time Helmsley Building) Fisher Brothers’ 299 Park and the Stahl Organization’s 277 Park.

Meanwhile Rudin Management and Vornado are weighing a possible combined redevelopment of Vornado’s 350 Park Ave. and Rudin’s 40 E. 52nd St. behind it.

RXR Realty owns 4 million square feet at 230 Park Ave. and 237 Park Ave. and at three nearby addresses — 450 Lexington Ave. 340 Madison Ave. and 530 Fifth Ave. It’s also slated to be the lead developer of 175 Park Ave.



RXR chairman and CEO Scott Rechler said the 175 Park project is awaiting city approval under the Uniform Land Use Review Procedure which he said could be completed by year’s end. The mega-tower would have 2 million square feet of offices. Could there really be a market for it given today’s highly uncertain conditions?



“We’re having conversations today with anchor tenants” Rechler said. “When you think about large companies growing in the city when you want to be right on top of public transit where do you find it on a scale like this?”



He said that the post-COVID market will see “a flight to quality” among space-seekers.

3 Auction house Phillips’ new location at 432 Park Ave. was designed to offer a “sense of community in a bustling metropolis.” Brett Beyer.

“People returning to the workplace need a reason to return to the workplace — an energized neighborhood clustered around nodes of activity and transit” Rechler said. “Look at One Vanderbilt. It continued to lease up throughout the pandemic and is now 90 percent occupied. Each thing helps the overall market.”



Now all Park Avenue needs is for employees to return to their desks. Come back soon!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXV0ZXJzLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvc3BvcnRzL3RhZWt3b25kby1pcmFuaWFuLXJlZnVnZWUtZGVmZWF0cy1leC1jb21wYXRyaW90LXF1ZXN0LXNlY29uZC10YWVrd29uZG8tbWVkYWwtMjAyMS0wNy0yNS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Taekwondo-Uzbekistan U.S. gold as Refugee Team miss out on first medal,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/taekwondo-iranian-refugee-defeats-ex-compatriot-quest-second-taekwondo-medal-2021-07-25/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXV0ZXJzLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvc3BvcnRzL3RhZWt3b25kby1pcmFuaWFuLXJlZnVnZWUtZGVmZWF0cy1leC1jb21wYXRyaW90LXF1ZXN0LXNlY29uZC10YWVrd29uZG8tbWVkYWwtMjAyMS0wNy0yNS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

KIM,Kimco Realty,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vdHJ1dGhvdXQub3JnL2FydGljbGVzL3Byby1pc3JhZWwtcGFjLWhhcy1zcGVudC1uZWFybHktMS1taWxsaW9uLXRvLXRyeS10by1zaW5rLW5pbmEtdHVybmVycy1jYW1wYWlnbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pro-Israel PAC Has Spent Nearly $1 Million to Try to Sink Nina Turner's Campaign,"This article was produced by Sludge  an independent ad-free investigative news site covering money in politics. Click here to support Sludge.

A pro-Israel PAC with ties to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) is spending big to defeat progressive candidate Nina Turner in an Ohio special Democratic primary election for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives representing a safely blue district.

Democratic Majority for Israel (DMFI) has spent $738000 opposing Turner and $203000 supporting her chief opponent Shontel Brown with a large portion of the spending ($351000) going towards producing and airing anti-Turner attack ads and smaller amounts going to digital platform advertising and direct mail pieces.

The primary contest between Turner and Brown to fill the seat vacated by U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Marcia Fudge is the latest high-profile battle between the Democratic establishment and a more left-leaning Democratic coalition exemplified by the members of the so-called Squad and Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaigns. Internal polls from the campaigns suggest that Turner is the favorite but a poll taken by Brown’s campaign while the DMFI ads began airing indicates Turner’s lead may have shrunk.

The two have striking differences when it comes to their policy goals. While Turner’s website names Medicare for All as a main issue Brown’s website says she would vote for Medicare for All if it came up but that she believes a public health care option is the best way to achieve universal health care coverage. On Israel Brown told Jewish Insider she would vote to continue sending the country $3.8 billion in military aid with no conditions while Turner said she supports conditioning the aid to “align with significant advances in human rights.” Brown’s more centrist policy goals have won her the assistance of the corporate influence industry — a recent fundraiser for her campaign was hosted by a raft of lobbyists for companies including ExxonMobil Google Comcast and Pfizer according to the Daily Poster.

Shontel Brown’s media webpage has featured a quote from DMFI President and Treasurer Mark Mellman since at least May more than a month before DMFI began spending in the race. Although it is illegal for campaigns to coordinate with outside spending groups like DMFI Brown’s website also features a red box filled with text that is designed to communicate messaging priorities for outside groups to use in their advertising while not violating the coordination law because the information is available to the general public. Ryan Grim pointed out at The Intercept that the messaging PDF linked in Brown’s red box is named “SB4C Red Box.”

DMFI appears to have pulled directly from Brown’s red box for some of their other materials. In an attack ad it’s airing DMFI displays a HuffPost headline about how she compared voting for Biden to eating a bowl of shit which is the top messaging suggestion in Brown’s red box. Another suggestion from Brown’s red box that Turner voted against the Democratic Party platform at the DNC was used by DMFI in a highly misleading mailer that claims Turner’s vote against the platform means she opposes universal health care and raising the minimum wage. Turner voted against the platform in part because it did not endorse universal health care and in 2016 she was the sponsor of the amendment to the DNC platform that added an endorsement of a $15 minimum wage.

DMFI PAC although a legally independent group is closely tied to the Democratic Party. The vendors employed by the group to execute the expenditures are all companies that work with Democratic Party organizations. For example DMFI’s top vendor for its spending in this race is Sage Media Planning & Placement Inc. which primarily works with the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and its offshoot group End Citizens United. Another DMFI vendor for the race is Trilogy Interactive LLC which works for the DCCC and Senate Majority PAC a super PAC affiliated with Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. Last cycle DMFI PAC received a $120000 donation from CHC Bold PAC the Congressional Hispanic Caucus PAC that is chaired by Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.).

Mellman’s consulting firm The Mellman Group has worked for multiple AIPAC-affiliated organizations including the American Israel Education Foundation and Citizens for a Nuclear Free Iran and has also been employed by major corporations and lobbying groups including Blue Cross Blue Shield PhRMA and Verizon. AIPAC is a lobbying group that was formed in the 1950s to create positive spin for Israel after the Israeli Army massacred dozens of Palestinian civilians in the village of Qibya. Several DMFI board members have previously held positions with AIPAC or its affiliate the American Israel Education Fund including co-chairs Ann Lewis and Todd Richman. The American Israel Education Foundation is a charitable offshoot of AIPAC that organizes fact-finding trips to Israel for members of Congress.

Today DMFI filed its pre-special election report with the FEC revealing for the first time the corporate executives and financiers who have been funding it this year. Here are some of the top donors to DMFI’s non-contribution account since January 1.

Amnon Rodan the former chairman of the multi-level marketing dermatology company Rodan + Fields has been DMFI’s largest donor this year giving the PAC $145000. He is married to billionaire Katie Rodan who co-created the acne management product Proactiv. Amnon is a director of the American Israel Education Fund and a former AIPAC board member.

Stacy Schusterman the chairman of Oklahoma-based oil and gas company Samson Energy has given DMFI $95000 so far this year. Samson Energy currently operates assets in the Denver Julesburg basin in Wyoming where it owns drilling rights to over 70000 acres. Schusterman is a prolific political donor who mainly gives to Democratic politicians and groups but last year she also donated the legal maximum of $5600 to Republicans Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma and Rep. Kay Granger of Texas. Stacy’s mother Lynn Schusterman is worth $3.4 billion according to Forbes. Schusterman has been a major donor to DMFI in previous years as The Intercept recently reported.

Victor Kohn the president of investment company Capital International Inc. donated $50000 to DMFI and the Kohn Family Trust chipped in another $50000. Kohn’s past campaign contributions have primarily gone to Democrats but he has also donated to Republicans including Minority Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.).

Andrew Viterbi is a co-founder of Qualcomm and the owner of Viterbi Group LLC a venture capital firm that invests in emerging wireless communication and network infrastructure companies. He gave DMFI $45000 this year. His son Alan Viterbia also gave the group $45000. Alan is the CEO of Liquid Environmental Solutions and a former vice president of Lockheed Martin.

Barry Porter the co-founder and managing general partner of private equity company Clarity Management donated $45000 to DMFI this year. Companies in the firm’s portfolio include oil and gas company Vaca Energy and copper mining company Skye Minerals Partners.

Alan Levow a board member of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee has given DMFI $45000 this year. Levow is a principal at real estate company Crowne Partners which manages several luxury multi-family housing units throughout the Southeast as well as multiple commercial properties in Florida. Levow is vice president of the American Israel Education Foundation.

Jeffrey Aronson co-founder and managing principal at Centerbridge Partners gave $45000. Centerbridge Partners is a vulture fund that specializes in distressed debt and leveraged buyouts and has been one of the biggest investors in Puerto Rico helping to further austerity policies on the island.

Milton Cooper founder of New York-based Kimco Realty donated $45000. Kimco is a public company that owns and operates dozens of shopping plazas throughout the country. Cooper is a member of AIPAC’s real estate division which is an initiative to encourage members of the New York real estate industry to get involved in pro-Israel politics.

Before the opening bell aviation firm JetBlue and engineering behemoth General Electric are scheduled to report earnings.

The financial releases of Bristol-Myers Squibb aircraft builder Boeing and Ford Motor are the key events slated for July 28. The next day is going to be as hectic when the earnings announcements of e-commerce giant Amazon.com Altria Group Yum! Brands and Merck & Co. are on tap.

Nothing gets cheddar than this…

The Kraft Heinz Company has partnered with Brooklyn-based Van Leeuwen Ice Cream to introduce a limited-edition macaroni and cheese flavor of ice cream.

“We know that there is nothing more refreshing on a hot summer day than ice cream. That is why we wanted to combine two of the most iconic comfort foods to create an ice cream with the unforgettable flavor of Kraft Macaroni & Cheese we all grew up with” Emily Violett senior associate brand manager for Kraft Macaroni & Cheese said in a news release.

To create the cheesy dessert Van Leeuwen churned the flavor of Kraft Macaroni & Cheese into its ice cream. “Not only does it taste delicious but it’s also made with high quality ingredients and contains no artificial flavors preservatives or dyes just like our Kraft Macaroni & Cheese” said Violett.

On Instagram Van Leeuwen called it “the ice cream you never knew you needed.”

Van Leeuwen began selling the new flavor on July 14 which is National Macaroni & Cheese Day. It was made available nationwide online and in their scoop shops in New York California New Jersey and Texas.

Of course it quickly sold out. But new supplies are on the way the ice cream company said.

“Who would’ve thought #NationalMAcAndCheeseDay would break the internet” Van Leeuwen said on Instagram. “We’re so flattered by the overwhelming response to this cheesy partnership with our friends Kraft Macaroni & Cheese.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlLTk4MjE0NzUvS3JhZnQtTWFjYXJvbmktQ2hlZXNlLWljZS1jcmVhbS1Gb29kLW9kZGl0eS1pbW1lZGlhdGVseS1zZWxscy1icmVha3MtaW50ZXJuZXQuaHRtbNIBhwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlLTk4MjE0NzUvYW1wL0tyYWZ0LU1hY2Fyb25pLUNoZWVzZS1pY2UtY3JlYW0tRm9vZC1vZGRpdHktaW1tZWRpYXRlbHktc2VsbHMtYnJlYWtzLWludGVybmV0Lmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kraft Macaroni and Cheese ice cream?! Food oddity immediately sells out breaks the internet,"A Kraft Heinz Company and Van Leeuwen Ice Cream partnership resulted in the limited-edition mac and cheese-flavored ice cream

Kraft Heinz and Brooklyn-based Van Leeuwen Ice Cream partnered to make a limited-edition macaroni and cheese-flavored ice cream last week - and the odd concoction sold out immediately with a promise more is on the way.

Still the food oddity wasn't exactly a hit on social media depending on how you measure it: It got lots of attention but much of that was along the lines of 'Yuck!'

A reviewer though said it was better than expected - with a buttery flavor.

'Who would've thought #NationalMacAndCheeseDay would break the internet' Van Leeuwen said in an Instagram post last Wednesday.

'We're so flattered by the overwhelming response to this cheesy partnership with our friends Kraft Macaroni & Cheese.'

Meanwhile Kraft Heinz Company celebrated the bizarre food creation adding that the ice cold collaboration came just in time for the summer season.

'We know that there is nothing more refreshing on a hot summer day than ice cream. That is why we wanted to combine two of the most iconic comfort foods to create an ice cream with the unforgettable flavor of Kraft Macaroni & Cheese we all grew up with' Emily Violett senior associate brand manager for Kraft Macaroni & Cheese said in a statement.

The food oddity debuted to quite the buzz last week quickly selling out and breaking the internet via social media in the process

The ice cream was sold online nationwide as well as at their ice cream shops located in New York Texas New Jersey and California

'Not only does it taste delicious but it's also made with high quality ingredients and contains no artificial flavors preservatives or dyes just like our Kraft Macaroni & Cheese' said Violett.

Despite the smash sell-out week fans of Mac and Cheese and fans of ice cream took to social media to voice their displeasure with the idea.

'I love mac and cheese but ice cream?? noooooo' Tracy Sharpe tweeted.

'Kraft mac and cheese ice cream? [What] is wrong with ya'll?' another person asked.

'I love Kraft macaroni and i love ice cream but I don't think I'd love this. But some part of me wants to like it. Hmmm' a third offered.

People took to social media to express their grossed-out reactions to the concoction

'They went too far with this one. What the hell is this abomination? Pretty sure this is one of the signs of the apocalypse. We already had a plague. A loser cheated his way into power. The ocean was on fire. Now Mac and cheese ice cream. We're f*****'.

'Oh for the love of god why?? mac and cheese is horrid without making it into an ice cream.'

'The news just announced a limited edition ice cream flavor (and) it's 'mac and cheese' flavored wtf?'

While many on social media decried the concept of mac and cheese flavored ice cream Van Leeuwen still sold out of the flavor a day after its debut on July 14 - National Macaroni & Cheese Day it says.

The ice cream was sold online nationwide as well as at their ice cream shops located in New York Texas New Jersey and California.

The company said more mac and cheese ice cream would be on the way. It sells for $12 a pint.

So how does it taste?

On NPR writer Amy McCarthy said it was 'definitely cheesy.'

'It's a little funky a little salty a little sweet. But altogether I'd just say it just kind of comes together. It's very creamy and buttery and it's a lot better than you think it's gonna be.'

On Instagram Van Leeuwen called it 'the ice cream you never knew you needed.'",,,,,,,,,

She stands at attention like a butler with cloth and spray bottle in hand.

A customer scans and bags their own groceries pays with a card and walks away silently. The employee then sprays and wipes the machine before retreating to allow another shopper to check themselves out.

Over several transactions in five minutes no one greets her and she speaks to no one.

This might strike one observer as dignified and efficient and another as unnerving; and they could both be right.

As long as I have the option I will prefer the human worker to a machine. Yet I am fully aware I take this stand on melting polar ice.

Whatever customers think about it retailers are moving toward touch-free payment technology with no human worker involved. Amazon opened its first cashier-less retail store in 2018. Walmart is testing all-self-checkout stores in Texas and in Canada with “hosts” taking the place of cashiers.

When some chain stores backed off from self-checkout technology early in the century I felt relief; but the machines have developed since and shoppers have warmed up to them. Self-checkout kiosks shipped in record numbers worldwide during 2020.

In trade publications industry executives point to surveys showing majorities of consumers enjoy self-checkout options especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. The outstanding problems are seen as how to make processes quicker and easier prevent theft and encourage more customers to use the technology.

My local Walmart has been expanding self-checkout machines since 2016. Even Costco which famously pulled away from self-checkout in 2013 has started reintroducing them. Like it or not this is the direction retailers are taking.

Kiosks are also on their way out — and so is cash. Retailers such as 7-11 Kroger Sam’s Club and others have been experimenting with app-based ways for customers to pay at least as far back as 2018. In an interview for Kiosk Marketplace AI executive Ariel Shemesh anticipates more scan-and-go technologies “smart carts” and cameras in the future.

The labor involved in scanning items bagging them and completing payment is being transferred away from paid employees to the customers themselves. It is worth noting what that displaces such as skill experience and integrity in an ensemble of people like the folks at my community grocery store.

But in the world of business this does not appear to be the “unique consumer experience” executives have in mind.

Writing in Forbes Raydiant CEO Bobby Marhamat says self-checkout technology presents opportunities to “connect with shoppers” by upselling advertising “exclusive” offers and “communicating brand messaging” (which sounds suspiciously like more advertising).

Those of us reluctant to embrace automation who do not find a marketplace of scanners cameras and drones attractive will be promised enhanced convenience and cleanliness. We will be assured employees albeit fewer of them will be more readily available to help us elsewhere. Eventually there will be no choice.

On Friday night a Target employee broke my years-long streak of self-checkout refusal — referred to within the industry as “friction” — through sheer subterfuge.

When the young woman invited me to step out of line and use a kiosk I explained politely that I don’t prefer them and was happy where I was. She said “I’ll check you out.”

After I left the line and followed her she scanned my first item pointed to where I would insert my card and then walked away and left me to it.

This was rude but I had to laugh. Human ingenuity had won again.

See https://www.sierraclub.org/texas/houston/blog/2021/08/virtual-public-meeting-landfill-threatens-sam-houston-national-forest

The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) is being petitioned to amend Permit #2406 for the Peach Creek Landfill (PCL) which is next to and near over 4000 acres of Sam Houston National Forest (SHNF) Wood Duck Farm (WDF) and many private landowners in San Jacinto or Montgomery Counties near the City of Cleveland and off of Fostoria Jayhawker and Pine Valley Roads.

Your letter to amend Permit #2406 to include the access road sent right now helps protect our public lands small private sustainable farms and homesteads and addresses road access water air noise litter and scenic pollutions flooding fires road overuse/damage and other problems that PCL may have.

What’s at Stake!

SHNF provides clean drinking water via ground and surface waters for local citizens and the City of Houston. The beautiful forests streams and wetlands of SHNF or surrounding private lands are called San Jacinto Flatwoods and have numerous streams like Whiskey Branch Jayhawker Creek Blue Branch Gum Branch Shell Branch Boggy Creek and Peach Creek.

Water percolates through sandy soils and feeds streams aquifers water tables and gravel beds. The federally endangered Red-cockaded Woodpecker White-tailed Deer Gray Squirrel Pileated Woodpecker and other wildlife are found in Loblolly and Shortleaf Pine Bottomland Hardwood-Pine and other forest habitats in the area.

WDF is an 87-acre sustainable farm that grows specialty greens for Houston Austin and Dallas restaurants. WDF sells produce at the Urban Harvest Farmer’s Market including sweet potatoes spinach potatoes peppers radishes corn carrots arugula strawberries blackberries beans basil broccoli cabbage onions eggplant kale lettuce cucumbers cauliflower and more.

Alcala died at 1:43 a.m. in a local community hospital.

He was sentenced to death in Orange County twice in 1980 and 1986 for the 1979 kidnapping and murder of 12-year-old Robin Samsoe.

The sentences were overturned two times and Alcala was granted a new trial.

Special to Fort Myers News-Press

BABCOCK RANCH Fla. – Babcock Ranch has jumped up 10 spots in six months to the No. 24 position in the country’s 50 top-selling master-planned communities of 2021 by RCLCO Real Estate Advisors.

The recognition comes on the heels of Kitson & Partners’ recent announcement that Babcock Ranch has surpassed 1400 new homes sold with 370 home sales year-to-date in America’s first solar-powered town.

Ranked as Southwest Florida’s top master-planned community based on Metrostudy data on single-family home annual starts in Charlotte Lee and Collier counties Babcock Ranch was also named Master-Planned Community of the Year by the Lee Building Industry Association at its 2020 Industry Awards.

Syd Kitson chairman and CEO of Kitson & Partners the developer of Babcock Ranch said “This vibrant new town is fulfilling our promise to deliver an innovative community with sustainability woven throughout. Our homebuyers are discovering an environmental haven that also offers beautiful homes that fit any lifestyle. It is exciting for our entire team to achieve this ranking.”

Babcock Ranch began marketing new homes in 2017 with the first residents moving into the town in January 2018. Today Babcock Ranch offers homes from seven homebuilders in seven neighborhoods. Construction is nearing completion at Crescent B Commons the 82640-square-foot Publix-anchored shopping center at a new entrance to Babcock Ranch about one mile south of the signature Babcock Ranch bridge.

Production staffers will start showing up a couple of hours later. Fans will roll into the parking lot that afternoon and doors will open at 6 p.m.

And finally at about 7:30 p.m. Chicago will step onto the DTE stage — presumably to a pent-up roar from the crowd — to end a 665-day concert hiatus for America’s most successful summer amphitheater.

In the era of COVID-19 not much is set in stone. But as things stand Chicago’s DTE show marks the opening of the floodgates as concerts return in full force across metro Detroit.

The veteran band with the big brass attack is fitting for the return of DTE which ranked No. 1 nationally in attendance in 2019: Chicago has played the former Pine Knob more than any act in the venue’s history logging 80-plus performances.

“We’ve been working very very hard to get to this moment” said Howard Handler president of 313 Presents which produces and promotes events at DTE and five other major venues. “We can’t wait to open the doors wide.”

Live music never technically stopped during the pandemic. Along with the array of online shows and drive-in events that popped up as a stopgap in 2020 there were scaled-down socially distanced festivals and concerts-in-the-park.

And we’ve already had a taste of bigger stuff in recent weeks including three shows at the Aretha Franklin Amphitheatre country maverick Jamey Johnson’s electric night at Michigan Lottery Amphitheatre and last weekend’s Faster Horses Festival which drew about 40000 to Michigan International Speedway.

But this is the week concerts come back big time.

At Detroit’s big four amphitheaters — DTE Michigan Lottery the Aretha Meadow Brook Amphitheatre — more than 70 shows are on the books through early October. Comerica Park will also be humming with music again and some of the region’s familiar music festivals are on the way.

For a 2½-month stretch there will be a major concert in metro Detroit nearly every night of the week.

""The excitement from the artists and fans is palpable"" said Dave Clark president of Live Nation's Great Lakes Region. ""You could feel it at Faster Horses — I had goosebumps when the artists walked onstage and heard the roar of the crowd. It’s something you can’t duplicate. That relationship is something so unique and special.""

The indoor action is revving up again too: Club calendars are heavily stocked with shows by both local and touring acts while midsized venues will soon welcome music again including rooms such as Royal Oak Music Theatre (Tanya Tucker Aug. 11) the Fox Theatre (Il Divo Sept. 9) and the Fillmore Detroit (State Champs Sept. 19).

At Little Caesars Arena a busy stretch of shows is lined up starting with Yo Gotti’s CMG Takeover on Aug. 28.

Notably more than 16 months after COVID-19 hit nearly every live-music spot in Michigan is intact — not what many would have predicted in March 2020 if they had known venues would be dark for a year-plus. Clubs in Warren (Hot Rock Bar) and Lansing (the Loft) announced permanent closures but the scene is otherwise resurrecting to its pre-pandemic state.

“It’s great because that’s definitely not the case in other states” said Nate Dorough of Audiotree Presents a concert promoter closely involved with the new National Independent Venues Association (NIVA).

NIVA hastily formed in spring 2020 by onetime competitors spearheaded efforts at state and federal levels to secure a lifeline for imperiled venues. In Michigan that led to $3.4 million in state-funded emergency grants which were distributed to more than 100 venues and promoters earlier this year.

Nationally the $16 billion Shuttered Venue Operators Grant — described by some as the biggest single instance of arts funding in world history — has begun to pay out to thousands of US venues including many in Michigan.

At 313 Presents — which oversees entertainment events at DTE LCA Michigan Lottery Meadow Brook the Fox and Comerica — Handler said his team has stayed in “constant communication” with health officials and others in the industry as it navigated the pandemic downtime. With so many unknowns as the months unfolded the concert schedule was a fluid ever-changing chess game.

“Back in February we thought September 1 was going to be the date to be honest” Handler said. “Things started to percolate as the vaccine rolled out and by April there was a certain amount of critical mass. We’ve been ready to come back for a while and so many artists were itching to get back on the road. That’s what they do. That’s who they are.”

The coming weeks are heavy on country artists who were the first to get out of the gate as touring came back to life. Brian O’Connell head of Live Nation’s country division said it was natural for Nashville’s performers and crews to quickly step on the gas.

“We’re nimble we’re in one place and the production doesn’t need 16 months of planning” O’Connell said. “When it was safe and deemed appropriate to do it we were coming.”

As DTE Energy Music Theatre resumes operations concertgoers will encounter some new developments: To speed up entry times the venue has enacted a no-bag policy eliminating part of the security checks at gates. Wallet-sized pouches small purses and medical bags are still allowed.

Like many venues in the business it’s also moving toward an all-digital ticketing system — your pass is on your mobile device — although with many fans still holding printed tickets from more than a year ago it’s not 100% yet.

DTE’s VIP space the Ivy Lounge has been upgraded including a new entrance direct from the parking lot.

And in a significant move on the sponsorship front the venue has its first cannabis partner. Troy-based Lume which operates dispensaries across the state signed a five-year deal that will call for branding throughout the amphitheater and a 6000-square-foot “Tree House” lounge by DTE’s west entrance. (Cannabis sales and consumption remain barred on the premises.)

Handler said 313’s venues are in good shape with staffing — something that has been a hurdle for many other part-time and summer employers amid the pandemic. But jobs remain available and those interested can visit ilitchcompanies.com to apply.

The Aretha on Detroit’s riverfront has also issued a callout for seasonal staffing and applications can be submitted at thearetha.com.

While many of the coming shows have been on sale for months — some even for nearly two years — fans have a chance to grab last-minute seats for $20 and no service fees as part of a US-wide Live Nation promotion.

The $20 deal which will start at noon Wednesday and run while tickets last includes 35 shows at 313 Presents’ local amphitheaters with dates such as the Black Crowes (Thursday) James Taylor-Jackson Browne (Aug. 1) the Counting Crows (Aug. 15) and Boyz II Men (Aug. 26).

The list of eligible $20 shows can be found at 313Presents.com.

Velasquez who worked at Live Nation’s Beverly Hills headquarters had traveled to Florida the night before the collapse to visit her parents Julio 67 and Angela 60.

“Our hearts break for the loss of our beloved Theresa Velasquez her parents Angela and Julio and everyone taken far too soon in the tragic accident in Surfside FL” a statement from Live Nation released on Saturday read. “Theresa was an impassioned leader at Live Nation who elevated every project she was part of at the same time breaking down barriers for women and the LGBTQIA+ community. We will always remember and honor the impact she made and will miss her dearly.”

Prior to her time at Live Nation Theresa charted a successful career as a musician in her own right deejaying at large stages across the world. She started off deejaying at clubs in her native Miami before her natural charisma and musicality brought her to larger audiences and venues like Miami Beach’s White Party and Aqua Girl Miami. She spun for New York’s Electric Zoo and Mysteryland USA and performed at Barcelona’s Circuit Festival and Madrid’s SuperMartxe.

“She was just so musically gifted with an incredible ear and the ability to lift up a crowd with her sets and original tracks” Rosslyn Luke Theresa’s partner told the Courier. “Her magnetic personality shone brightly from the DJ booth.”

Theresa founded her own music label in 2013 alongside Grammy-nominated DJ Hector Fonseca named Audio4Play. The record label specializes in House music and features LGBTQ artists.

Theresa brought this same passion for representation into her work on the business side of the music industry. After earning a master’s degree in the music business from New York University she went on to work at labels including Sony Music and SFX Entertainment. She eventually settled at Live Nation where she worked as an executive for six years championing projects by gender and sexual minorities.

“She was also so proud of the multiple sponsorship deals she secured for Live Nation which were massive unique and extremely complex in structure” Rosslyn said.

For all of Theresa’s career accomplishments Rosslyn described her partner as prouder of her relationships than anything else. “She was proud of every win big or small by the people she loved and supported them unconditionally. She never missed an opportunity to help support or champion someone and the incredible relationships she maintained are a testament to that” she said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4cHJlc3MuY28udWsvZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9tdXNpYy8xNDY3MzYzL0VsdmlzLVByZXNsZXktTGFzLVZlZ2FzLUhpbHRvbi1zaG93cm9vbS1zdGF0dWVz0gFpaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZXhwcmVzcy5jby51ay9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L211c2ljLzE0NjczNjMvRWx2aXMtUHJlc2xleS1MYXMtVmVnYXMtSGlsdG9uLXNob3dyb29tLXN0YXR1ZXMvYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Elvis Presley painted statues black in Las Vegas showroom during fire to ‘integrate’ venue,"Elvis: Trailer for concert documentary ‘That’s the Way It Is’

During the early 1970s Elvis Presley performed his Las Vegas residences at the International Hotel which became a Hilton in 1971 and is known as Westgate today. Georgann Reynolds of the Elvis Country Fan Club is a huge fan of The King and would go see him perform in the hotel’s showroom many times. During a recent interview she shared how one night during a fire Elvis was evacuated downstairs to the showroom where he painted the skin of the Marie Antionette statues to the right of the stage black.

Speaking with Elvis expert Billy Stallings Spa Guy in the video below Reynolds said how one night this fire (not to be confused with the infamous 1981 blaze) had broken out on the 26th and 27th floor where she was staying. She said: “We were evacuated and Elvis was evacuated because he was on the 30th [in his penthouse suite] and everybody in between was evacuated.” “We came down first they let us down on the elevators. Everybody else had to walk the stairs. I’m sure Elvis didn’t but anyway…somebody said ‘Elvis is in the showroom!’ “Here we go in our nightclothes across the lobby of the Hilton hotel and of course they wouldn’t let us in.” READ MORE: Elvis: What Willie Nelson realised he should've done at Las Vegas show

The Olympic Games is one of the greatest cultural events of the past century. Although in recent decades it has been accompanied by an anthemic song usually performed by a major star very few have lasted the test of time. With the exception of Whitney Houston's spectacular 1988 One Moment In Time Barcelona remains the most iconic and memorable.

It was created in 1987 to be the theme to the 1992 Summer Games in Barcelona but Freddie's deteriorating health ultimately meant it was only used to accompany a video presentation of the city on the international broadcast. However recording the song and performing with his idol remained one of the happiest and proudest moments of Freddie's life. Years later his PA Peter Freestone told The Express: ""After he got Montserrat Caballe to sing with him on the Barcelona album that was the nearest I’ve seen him to tears. He was so happy. He said ‘The greatest voice in the world is singing my music.’"" READ MORE: Queen Live Aid: Did Freddie and the band 'cheat' to sound louder than the others?

Freddie had already been obsessed with Montserrat's voice for years. Freestone added: ""It was the visit to the Royal Opera House on February 3rd 1981 for the performance of Un Ballo in Maschera where he (Freddie) heard Montserrat Caballe for the first time. ""It was a pure joy to see the wonderment on Freddie’s face after she had finished singing in the trio during Act I. Freddie just couldn’t believe what he had heard and said then he had just heard the greatest voice in the world."" Years later he was asked during an interview on Spanish television who he would most love to sing with. Of course he answered Montserrat Caballe. Word got back to the opera icon and she put things in motion that lead to their legendary collaboration. In one of his last-ever recorded interviews Freddie described his extraordinary joy when Montserrat called him out of the blue. DON'T MISS

In 1987 Freddie said: ""She just called up a few weeks ago and said she’d love to work with me. I fell flat on the floor. I thought ‘My God!’ But I’ve loved her for years. I went to Barcelona on a TV show and I said she’s the best singer in the world and I’d love to sing with her and she must have seen it. She called up the office and said she’s like to do things. ""It’s amazing. I’m into opera now. Forget rock n roll. It’s such a challenge I’ve never thought of writing songs like that. I’m sure the opera critics will slam it but it’s a good challenge at this time in life."" They met in 1987 and discovered a mutual passion for creating something new. An entire album was born between tapes sent back and forth between the UK and Spain and recording sessions in London. Montserrat revealed that Freddie originally came to Barcelona and played her some of his compositions for them to duet on. And she was “captivated.” The opera star said Freddie's work was “magnificent. It is something very special it is created from the heart.”

She said: ""We were in Freddie’s house there were days when we were maybe there until six or seven in the morning because after dinner they went to the piano and he played the piano and sang and Montserrat improvised. Truly it was an incredible party. ""For Freddie Montserrat was something out of this world. He had such love and admiration for her he was always watching to make sure everything was perfect for her. When we arrived at the hotel there were roses in every room we wanted for nothing."" While the pair were still working on their collaboration Montserrat also gave a performance at the Royal Opera House with Freddie in attendance. Freddie described how she “embarrassed” him by introducing him to the crowd: “I was sitting there with my tuxedo and I had to stand up and take a bow. She blew kisses to me and I blew kisses back.” Montserrat said: “The audience loved it. They went crazy at the Royal Opera House.”

Freddie Mercury and Montserrat Caballe became great friends

At the official launch of the song Barcelona in Ibiza in May 1987 Freddie joked that he would dedicate the rest of his future to the woman he called Montsi: “(I'll do) some more songs with Montsi. She’s gonna take up all my time now and I’m quite prepared to do it. I’m looking forward to all that time."" Of course time was not something Freddie had. The single was released in October 1987 and became a major hit reaching Number Eight in the UK charts. in 1990 Freddie confided in Montsi that his health was failing and that he would not survive to perform their song together at the Olympics.",,,

The USAF is determined to replace its fleet of RQ-4 Global Hawk drones deemed obsolete by the service in view of emerging threats from adversaries such as China.

Testifying before the Senate Appropriations Committee Lt. Gen. David S. Nahom US Air Force Deputy Chief of staff for plans and programs said that the successor of the RQ-4 Global Hawk is expected to be inducted into the USAF service by the end of this decade.

Lt. Gen. Nahom said that the existing Global Hawk fleet is inadequate against modern air defenses and its replacements are on the way reported Air Force Magazine.

At “the speeds it flies the altitudes it flies and the makeup of the aircraft it’s just not survivable in these contested environments that we’re going to be looking to gather intelligence from in the future” the top Air Force official said referring to Block 40 Global Hawk.

However it is said that E-8 Joint STARS and the Global Hawk will be used to meet the Ground Moving Target Indicator mission. Nahom also reiterated that the Global Hawks will be extremely significant in the coming six to eight years while the USAF decides about their replacement.

He also admitted that the threat has accelerated much more in the past few years. Also present at the Committee meeting Senator Richard Shelby pointed out that China’s strong economic base makes the Asian country a much bigger threat than the Soviet Union ever was during the Cold War.

Similar concerns were voiced by Air Force General Charles Brown earlier this year when he stated that many legacy intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance platforms are found to be unable to deliver “needed capabilities on competition-relevant timelines”.

It was recommended that such platforms be phased out and resources be invested in modern and relevant systems.

The Global Hawk Drones

Developed by Northrop Grumman the RQ-4 Global Hawk is a high-altitude long-endurance remotely piloted aircraft. Equipped with an integrated sensor suite it can conduct intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) missions during day or night and in all-weather conditions.

According to the USAF the Global Hawk provides a broad spectrum of ISR collection capability to help the combatant forces in various peacetime contingency and wartime operations.

The aircraft is 14.5m in length is 4.7 m high and has a wingspan of 39.8 m. The speed of the aircraft is 357 mph and the average range is 12300 nautical miles. It has been in operation with the USAF since 2001 and has more than 250000 flight hours in missions supporting military operations in Iraq Afghanistan North Africa and the Asia-Pacific region.

As the USAF seeks to replace it the two likely contenders to the Global Hawk seem to be Lockheed Martin’s TR-X and Northrop Grumman’s RQ-180

Lockheed Martin TR-X

US defense giant Lockheed Martin believes its new TR-X will be a capable replacement for the USAF’s Global Hawk as well as U-2. The “high-flying hard-to-see drone” is expected to incorporate the designs of both the U-2 and the Global Hawk reported Popular Mechanics.

The TR-X is expected to operate in ISR missions at altitudes of about 70000 feet. According to reports the aircraft may have stealth features of the other Lockheed designs such as the F-22 and F-35 aircraft.

It is expected to have “swept-back wing mainplanes outward cranked tail fins and a dorsal intake set aft of the nose”. Mission equipment is expected to be located internally with a built-in modular payload capability.

It would be 16 m long 4.50 m high and have a wingspan of 21 m. equipped with a General Electric F 118 Turbofan engine to provide an estimated 20000 lb of thrust. Currently under development the TR-X is expected to enter service by 2025.

In 2016 Lockheed had proposed a 10-year program to deliver 30 aircraft. Explaining the similarities with the Global Hawk Lockheed Martin’s U-2 business development manager Scott Winstead said that the aircraft will have the “same 130-foot wingspan as the Global hawk to prevent basing issues with existing hangars”.

Winstead further mentioned that the TR-X will have a newly designed straight wing which will be complemented by low-observable (LO) shaping. The LO and the electronic countermeasures will provide adequate defense against detection by surface-to-air missile systems.

The Northrop Grumman RQ-180

Another contender to replace the Global Hawk is the Northrop Grumman RQ-180 stealth unmanned aerial vehicle. The RQ-180 has its design motivated by advanced broadband all-aspect very low-observable (stealth) requirements reported The Drive.

The RQ-180 can operate as a networking and reconnaissance platform which can fly deep into enemy airspace. Flying as high as 70000 feet the RQ-180 is expected to outpace fighters and drones in enemy airspace and be capable of gathering line-of-sight data from the F-35 and B-21 Multi-function Advanced Data Link (MADL) systems and F-22’s stealthy Infra-Flight Data Link (IFDL).

The stealth reconnaissance drone RQ-180 has been operational since 2017 The National Interest had reported. Though the USAF never officially acknowledged the fact it is believed that the RQ-180 had been based in Guam to support the radar-evading drone in the Pacific region. It is believed that the USAF had tested the RQ-180 at Groom Lake in Nevada near the Area 51 complex. Missing In Action – Why Indian Navy Has Been ‘Shying-Away’ From Using Its Aircraft Carriers In Major Conflicts?

The RQ-180 has extensive stealth features such as a unique body shape and coatings to avoid detection by enemy radars. It is based on the same form and function as that of the Lockheed RQ-170 Sentinel though it has a more enhanced endurance envelope.

It is 40 m long 10 m high and has a wingspan of 50 m. It is equipped with one turbofan engine and has a ceiling of 12200 m and a range of 3900 km. The drone will be equipped with mission-specific payloads related to its intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance missions.

Many experts believe that the RQ-180 has a striking resemblance to another Northrop Grumman manufactured product the B-2 and the B-21 Raider Bomber.

Last year The EurAsian Times had also reported that the RQ-180 was photographed by actor Rob Kolinsky when the stealth spy drone flew over his house. In an Instagram post he mentioned a similarity with the B-21 and stated “this thing flew over my house several weeks ago and I still have yet to identify it”.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vZGVmZW5jZS1ibG9nLmNvbS91LXMtc3BlY2lhbC1mb3JjZXMtZXZhbHVhdGVzLXN0cmlrZS1jYXBhYmlsaXRpZXMtb2YtY295b3RlLWFpcmNyYWZ0L9IBYWh0dHBzOi8vZGVmZW5jZS1ibG9nLmNvbS91LXMtc3BlY2lhbC1mb3JjZXMtZXZhbHVhdGVzLXN0cmlrZS1jYXBhYmlsaXRpZXMtb2YtY295b3RlLWFpcmNyYWZ0Lz9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,U.S. Special Forces evaluates strike capabilities of Coyote aircraft,"Private contractor Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC) announced that it has demonstrated the multi-role strike capabilities of the MC-145B Coyote aircraft at Eglin Air Force Base Florida as part of the U.S. Special Operations Command’s (USSOCOM) Armed Overwatch program. SNC is partnered with PZL Mielec a Lockheed Martin Company for the program.

The MC-145B Coyote is a manned light attack aircraft designed to support U.S. special operations forces in permissive environments.

As noted by the company the new plane is a significantly enhanced and modified version of the M28 short take-off and landing twin-engine turboprop a utility aircraft currently operating in the some of the harshest environments across the globe including the deserts of Jordan the extreme cold of Estonia and the subtropical forests of Kenya.

The aircraft’s high wing powerful engines and rugged fixed tricycle gear are ideal for safe and reliable operations in the austere environments anticipated for the Armed Overwatch mission.

The MC-145B weapon system employs extensive airframe modifications including wing weapons pylons a retractable sensor lift additional fuel tanks and internal weapons launchers to accommodate state of the art sensor and weapons system technologies.

A new digital cockpit provides flight and mission data to the pilots while boasting training and logistics commonality with the U-28A Draco (Pilatus PC-12) surveillance aircraft.

The MC-145B features both a cabin and a C-130-style air-operable rear cargo ramp. The aircraft rapidly re-configures to air drop paratroop and casualty evacuation roles while supporting self-deployment and resupply of forward operating locations without a reliance on strategic airlift assets.

“We approached the Armed Overwatch platform from a different direction embracing the requirements for endurance austere operations and weapons payload with a look toward supporting SOCOM’s future challenges” said Robert Horky senior vice president of Strategic Initiatives for SNC’s Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) Aviation and Security (IAS) business area. “MC-145B Coyote’s unique configuration brings versatility in sensor and weapons employment to best meet SOCOM’s ever-evolving needs.”

Initial aerodynamic and flight modelling performed at SNC illustrate feasibility to deploy large palletized munitions including Joint Air to Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) from the MC-145B’s cabin. This capability in conjunction with payload/power provisions for future long-range sensors and electronic warfare systems is highlighted as a roadmap toward engagement in both traditional permissive environments and the near-peer fight.

Development of the MC-145B weapons system follows a longstanding collaboration between SNC and Lockheed Martin previously seen with Special Operations Forces Global Logistics Support Services team (SOF GLSS) on AC/MC-130J fleet missions worldwide.

“The M28 turboprop has proven its value in forward-deployed military operations around the world where payload endurance short take-off and landing capabilities and exceptional low-speed handling characteristics are critical to mission success” said Paul Lemmo president of Sikorsky a Lockheed Martin Company. “SNC clearly sees how the future MC-145B variant can grow to take on new sensors weapons and equipment that can meet evolving operational needs.”

More than 100 M28 aircraft have been produced and delivered to customers worldwide in both commercial and military configurations.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9ldm9sdXRpb24uY29tL25ld3MvZi0zNWEtbGlnaHRuaW5nLWxsLWRlbW9zLWFsbW9zdC12ZXJ0aWNhbC1mbGlnaHQtb3Zlci13YXNoaW5ndG9uLTE2NTg5Mi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,F-35A Lightning ll Demos Almost Vertical Flight Over Washington,"It’s the middle of the year already and despite the still ongoing health crisis 2021 has been a tad different (better?) than 2020. One of the ways we can see that is the resurgence of shows people are allowed to attend.

For military aircraft enthusiasts this year has already been one filled with delight. The American homeland has already been the host of several air shows across its states and it will continue to be so for the coming months.One of the most constant presence at these air shows is the F-35A Lightning II Demonstration Team a unit of the 388th Fighter Wing tasked with showing civilians and others the capabilities of one of the nation's most potent weapons platforms.We’ve seen the planes of the team especially the one of its commander Maj. Kristin Wolfe in various stances at various air shows over the past few months and now we get another glimpse at it as it soars to the sky.The photo released by the U.S. Air Force (USAF) last week shows the aircraft as it flies over Commencement Bay during the 4th of July weekend’s the 2021 Tacoma Freedom Fair in Tacoma  Washington.The plane is seen almost vertical as it climbs using the power provided by the Pratt & Whitney F135 engine that can take it to speeds of Mach 1.6 thanks to the 43000 lbf (190 kN) of thrust it develops with the afterburner.The aircraft which is so young it is largely unproven in combat is presently deployed in slightly different variants with the USAF Navy and Marine Corps. The Lockheed Martin machine also serves the needs of some allied nations including the UK Australia and Israel. For the record Israel was the first to fly the aircraft into combat back in 2018.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vbmF0aW9uYWxpbnRlcmVzdC5vcmcvYmxvZy9idXp6L3gtMTUtbWFjaC02Ny1zdXBlci1wbGFuZS1tYWRlLWFpci1mb3JjZS1oaXN0b3J5LTE5MDQ0NdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,X-15: The Mach 6.7 Super Plane That Made Air Force History,"The X-15 took part in a record-setting flight when on October 3 1967 U.S. Air Force test pilot William Knight became the fastest flying pilot ever when he achieved a speed of Mach 6.7 a record that has stood for over half a century.

Experimental aircraft – also referred to as X-planes or X-vehicles – have a long and storied history among the United States’ aeronautics and aerospace communities. The United States Air Force Navy and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) have over the years developed a number of X-planes and the total list currently includes 56 experimental aircraft. Even the first of these the X-1 proved to be significant as it became the first aircraft to fly faster than the speed of sound.

NASA is once again renewing its focus on X-planes and its X-59 experimental aircraft developed in association with Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works division is being developed with the goal of achieving supersonic speeds over land that produce sonic booms which result in reduced noise disturbances on the ground.

Of all of the series of X-planes however the one that stands out as the most recognizable and famous – and as perhaps the most productive – is the X-15.

The three rocket-powered X-15s produced by North American Aviation Inc. conducted a total of 199 flights over a nearly ten-year period from June 1959 to October 1968. The X-15 was part of a hypersonic flight research program designed to test and investigate a number of aspects associated with piloted hypersonic flight and information gained from the X-15 program would be used in the development of the Mercury Gemini and Apollo piloted spaceflight programs as well as in the Space Shuttle Program.

The X-15 also took part in a record-setting flight when on October 3 1967 U.S. Air Force test pilot William Knight became the fastest flying pilot ever when he achieved a speed of Mach 6.7 a record that has stood for over half a century.

Even with its impressive technical feats and significant contributions to piloted hypersonic and space flight the X-15 was not perfect. One X-15 pilot lost his life while operating the aircraft while William Knight only a few months before his record-setting flight managed to safely land his aircraft after its entire electrical system failed.

Good thing then that the X-15 came equipped with a very impressive and technologically complex ejection system.

Given the speeds and altitudes at which the X-15 typically operated a novel ejection system was designed for use with the aircraft. This included the use of a pressure suit that protected the pilot from both the windblast of ejecting at Mach 3 and allowed pilots to survive at altitudes of over 250000 feet.

The ejection seat meanwhile included measures designed to help transfer weight from the pilot’s rear to the seat given the thrust involved in the ejection mechanism that was required to ensure that the pilot would clear the aircraft’s hypersonic shockwave. Special restraints were also added that prevented the pilot’s arms and legs from flailing during ejection and which helped to protect against heat burns.

Special wings were also added that deployed from the side of the seat to help stabilize it while telescopic booms added to the front and back of the seat also aided in stabilization and braking.

Indeed the X-15’s ejection system stands out as one of the aircraft’s more impressive features.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cmFzaWFudGltZXMuY29tL3VzLXRlc3RzLWl0cy1wb3dlcmZ1bC1hZWdpcy1iYWxsaXN0aWMtbWlzc2lsZS1kZWZlbnNlLXN5c3RlbS10YXJnZXQtaW50ZXJjZXB0ZWQv0gFuaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZXVyYXNpYW50aW1lcy5jb20vdXMtdGVzdHMtaXRzLXBvd2VyZnVsLWFlZ2lzLWJhbGxpc3RpYy1taXNzaWxlLWRlZmVuc2Utc3lzdGVtLXRhcmdldC1pbnRlcmNlcHRlZC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US Tests Its Powerful Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System; Target Intercepted,"The US military has carried out a test of the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System successfully intercepting at least one target the US Missile Defense Agency (MDA) said.

“The U.S. Missile Defense Agency in cooperation with the U.S. Navy conducted Flight Test Aegis Weapon System 33 in the broad ocean area northwest of Hawaii July 24” the MDA informed on Saturday.

The objective was to intercept two short-range ballistic missile targets using four Standard Missile-6 Dual II missiles.

“Based on initial observations one target was successfully intercepted. At this time we cannot confirm the second target was destroyed” the MDA said.

These were the most complex exercises of this kind to date according to the MDA using two test targets and a ship (the USS Ralph Johnson) equipped with the Aegis missile defense system. It was the third flight test of an Aegis-equipped vessel using the SM-6 Dual II missile.

Earlier the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) had stated that the temporary installation and integration of the US Aegis Ashore system with missile defense batteries in Poland has allowed a series of tests prior to the system’s permanent deployment"

Volunteers of Fields Playground Group have been at work for four years to make the Mila’s Hope and Rowyn’s Dreams Playground a reality. Organizers learned this week that the home improvement store plans to help financially assist the project.

Fields Playground Group is ready to bring an inclusive and fully accessible playground for children of all abilities and ages on to the grounds of the former Waterloo Middle School on Route 44. The name of the playground honors Mila DiGirolamo granddaughter of organization president Susan Monegan and Rowyn Terihay daughter of organization secretary Amy Decker.

The playground will allow those with physical or developmental disabilities to play freely in an accessible safe environment. Monegan began work on it due to frustration at the lack of options in the area for her grandaughter Mila now 8 who has special needs. Though the two were able to spend time together at the all-inclusive SOAR Playground in nearby Stow Monegan wanted Portage County families to have a more local option.

Making a playground in Randolph that is both accessible and inclusive is not an afterthought Amanda Phipps social media director for Fields Playground Group said. The group wanted the space to be fun for typical developing children and also welcoming for people with special needs.

Phipps is the sister-in-law of Record-Courier sports reporter Allen Moff.

The playground will be about 2 acres and will be located near the front of the property where the old middle school used to be. Equipment at the park will include items such as a zip line with an ADA-accessible bucket seat. A similar zip line with a typical seat runs right alongside it. The park has an emphasis on putting typical and special playground equipment near each other.

Rowyn who uses a wheelchair and a walker is very much looking forward to playing on the ""Ability Whirl"" -- a merry-go-round that is flush with the ground for easy wheelchair access.

The surface of the playground will be made of poured-in-place rubber to allow for easy accessibility and minimal maintenance. The play area will also be surrounded by 11 benches for parents to sit on and watch their kids.

Fields Playground Group will donate the property the playground is on back to Randolph once construction is completed. It continues to strive to add to the project however. Permanent restrooms will be part of the playground's second or third phase which is a big part of why fundraising continues.

Donations can be made to Fields Playground Group and sent to the Portage Community Bank locations in either Kent or Ravenna. Ways to donate digitally or a printable donation form can also be found on the Fields Playground Group website www.fieldsplaygroundgroup.org.

The playground project was selected from more than 2200 entries to Lowe's 100 Hometowns initiative which was created to celebrate the company's 100th birthday.

It’s a tour he’s given countless times since learning the approximately 230-square-foot space will get a much-needed upgrade thanks to a grant from Lowe’s.

“When they sent the email I leapt out of my chair” said Perry-LaPoint the center’s director of marketing and outreach.

Dozens of meals are prepared and distributed at the kitchen each week helping to feed the most disadvantaged and creating a vibrant sense of community. But the kitchen’s current layout has limited how the space can be utilized Perry-LaPoint said.

The space is currently the main thoroughfare between the center’s community room and back offices where a bulk of services are provided and the constant foot traffic has limited the area’s use.

A $50000 grant from Lowe’s to remodel the space will ensure the kitchen is fully utilized and will allow the center to begin teaching classes on food preparation Perry-LaPoint said.

The money was awarded as part of the home improvement store’s 100 Hometowns initiative which provided full funding to 100 community projects across 36 states. The program was launched earlier this year as part of the chain store’s centennial celebration.

More than 2200 projects applied for funding under the program.

Perry-LaPoint said the center had been discussing renovating its kitchen for two years prior to applying for funding. An application was filed after a staff member learned of the program earlier this year.

“We figured we’ll just take a swing for the fences” he said.

Now with money in hand staff members at the center have been busy moving equipment in preparation for construction which is expected to begin by the middle of next month.

Work is expected to be completed by the end of October. The center’s facilities manager and volunteers will likely complete a bulk of the work.

Plans call for erecting a pair of walls which will ensure the kitchen is its own separate space. The current entrance will be blocked off and a new entry leading to the back offices will be built just to the left of the current entrance.

Two pass-throughs will also be installed so meals can be distributed to those in the community room. The crooked cabinets that currently adorn the wall will be replaced by a series of shelves throughout the space.

A pair of commercial-grade refrigeration units will also be purchased giving the center much-needed storage space for its twice-weekly meal distribution as well as its food bank.

Several prep tables will be added which will allow the center to begin teaching food-preparation classes which Perry-LaPoint hopes to begin later this year.

Saratoga County uses the kitchen for its congregate meals program (which has been suspended due to the pandemic) as well as its meal delivery program.

Hundreds rely on the kitchen each month Perry-LaPoint said.

He added that staff members have been monitoring the pandemic and are hopeful construction will be completed ahead of schedule so the center can be prepared should the need for services increase.

“We’re hoping to get this done on time or ahead of time so that we don’t have a sudden increase in need while we’re trying to get this place prepared” he said.

Washington Wizards guard Bradley Beal dribbles the ball against Boston Celtics guard Jaylen Brown. AP Photo/Nick Wass

The Celtics have long had rumored interest in Wizards star Bradley Beal but if the price is Jaylen Brown two ESPN analysts don’t seem to think a trade is likely.

Beal reportedly might request a trade from the Wizards after several uninspiring seasons and the Celtics — who employ his childhood best friend Jayson Tatum — are a team he would like to join.

Getting Beal to Boston might not be easy however. On Sunday ESPN analyst Zach Lowe joined NBA news breaker Adrian Wojnarowski for a chat in which they discussed potential trade packages.

“Is Boston going to offer Jaylen Brown? I don’t think so” Lowe said while Wojnarowski shook his head in agreement. “To me there’s not much point in giving up one star for another if you’re Boston.”

Lowe noted that several teams who could target Beal in trade talks might not have ideal assets available — the Warriors have a pair of middling lottery pick and some young pieces while the Miami Heat could offer Tyler Herro whose trade value plummeted this season.

The Celtics have clear incentive to pursue Beal in some capacity. Last year’s team struggled to coax double-teams away from Tatum and Beal would accomplish that almost single-handedly. Tatum and Beal’s relationship is well documented — the duo grew up together in St. Louis and have been close friends for years. Whenever they play together — in the Olympics before Beal had to leave due to COVID-19 as well as this past season’s All-Star game — both admit that it’s a big deal.

“Two guys from the same neighborhood the same high school going to the Olympics from St. Louis that’s like a dream” Tatum said recently. “That is amazing.”

But as Lowe noted trading Brown is a big ask. Beal is a free agent next offseason and while pairing Tatum and Beal might be enough to keep Beal’s attention the Celtics might be gun shy about losing another big-name acquisition.

And of course Brown is a highly valuable player — a rising star who gets better every season on a team-friendly contract who won’t hit free agency again until 2024. A first-time All-Star this past season Brown averaged 24.7 points and 6.4 rebounds while shooting 39.7 percent from 3-point range.

The Celtics likely won’t be able to piece together a particularly compelling package without Brown. Other teams will have a lot of interest in Beal and the Celtics have little other marquee talent. New President of Basketball Operations Brad Stevens can’t even offer a 2021 pick after he included the No. 16 selection in the trade that sent Kemba Walker to the Thunder for Al Horford.

Still Stevens and the Celtics should be motivated to try for three major reasons. The first is Beal’s relationship with Tatum — acquiring Tatum’s childhood best friend might engender a significant amount of good will. The second is the pressing concern that the 76ers could swoop in with a deal that includes Ben Simmons creating yet another stacked team in the Celtics’ own division. And finally of course a team with Tatum Beal and Brown might have a championship foundation in place.

The NBA Draft takes place on Thursday. Expect plenty of Celtics chatter between now and then.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBhcGVyY2l0eW1hZy5jb20vZmFzaGlvbi93ZWRkaW5ncy93YWx0LWxvd2UtaG91c3Rvbi1zcG9ydHMtZG9jdG9yLXdlZGRpbmctY2hyaXMtc2hlcGhlcmQtbWluaXN0ZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Famed Houston Sports Doctor's Star-Studded Wedding is Presided Over By a Newly Ordained Chris Shepherd,"Kim Hausler is escorted to the altar by her sons.

This was not your typical wedding and it was not the expected judge or priest who presided over the Pebble Beach nuptials of Kim Hausler and Dr. Walt Lowe head team physician for the Houston Texans the Houston Rockets and the University of Houston. Houston chef extraordinaire Chris Shepherd ordained by the Universal Life Church conducted the al fresco ceremony which was attended by an impressive clutch of sports world heavyweights.

The Friday afternoon wedding was held in the garden of a private residence overlooking the Pacific Ocean in a setting bedecked with roses and rose petals.

Lowe and Shepherd have been fast friends for more than 15 years so it was with sincere emotion that the chef spoke about the couple’s kindness their commitment to family and commented on their unity.

“It is impossible now for me to consider one of you without the other” Shepherd said.

In a brilliant moment of levity in the beautiful ceremony for which the couple wrote their own vows Shepherd quipped that all in attendance would receive absolution thanks to the Universal Life Church from their sins — past present and future. Lucky them.

The ceremony was truly a family affair. Lowe’s granddaughter Petra presented the rings from Houston-based Zadok Jewelers. Hausler’s daughters Madison and Nicole and Lowe’s daughter AJ Lowe served as bridesmaids Lowe’s son Hunter and the bride’s sons Mason and Brandon were groomsmen. The Hausler sons walked their mother down the aisle.

The bride a home care physical therapist and the groom met when he operated on her daughter Madison’s torn ACL. A year later Lowe asked her out on a date. She was hesitant but one of her daughter’s friends took her phone and responded that Kim would love to go to dinner. And then it began.

Of courses Lowe is a familiar face on the Houston sports sidelines.

The couple’s wedding party rocked into high gear following the ceremony with the music selections of Miami-based DJ NikkoNation and then the rock and country sounds of Houston’s Seth Keiffer Band.

Food and fun followed the ceremony with food stations across the lawn serving pasta tacos and sliders paired with cocktails and mini beignets and milkshakes for dessert. As one might expect in California there was an array of wines: Sauvignon Blanc from local winery Caraccioli Underbelly (Shepherd’s hospitality enterprise) Hoot’Nanny Cabernet Sauvignon from Miner Family Vineyards in Napa and a Red Blend from Cruse Wine Co. in Petaluma.

At the pre-wedding party in the couple’s suite at Bernardus on Thursday night guests savored ready-to-drink cocktails from the talented hands of Houston’s Alba Huerta. While Huerta was not in attendance her bottled cocktails were — and they made an impression.

Among guests were Major League Baseball Hall of Famer Jeff Bagwell and wife Rachel former Houston Texans general manager Rick Smith former Houston Texans player and current conditioning coach Brian Cushing and his wife Megan team physician for the Houston Astros Dr. Jim Muntz and wife Anne Sheridan and John Eddie Williams and Michelle and Jonathan Zadok.

That may have been Patrick Nolan’s intent but his truck’s infotainment system placed him outside his Plymouth Township home on Shefield Court between 12:30 and 12:34 a.m.

He would return to the party where his truck was at at about 2:15 a.m. when someone called 911 to say Nolan's township home was an inferno.

35th District Court Judge Ronald Lowe opined that he knows from watching the courthouse burn in 1997 that a building can burn for some time before anyone sees evidence of a blaze.

After listening to prosecutors present that timeline information in the courtroom Lowe sent Nolan’s arson case to the higher Third Circuit Court for trial. If convicted on the two arson charges Nolan could spend the rest of his life in prison.

“At best the state has a circumstantial case” Lowe said. “The difficulty for you Mr. Nolan is that they put that many pieces together.”

His decision concluded an all-day July 23 preliminary exam that included several witnesses and plenty of photos. The photos in the judge's opinion proved arson burned down Nolan’s home.

Predicting that any jury will be disappointed to learn there's no obvious smoking gun he noted that Nolan had the incentive opportunity and expertise to burn down his insured home for financial gain.

An insurance representative who investigated Nolan’s fire claim testified that the former firefighter told her he had cashed out a 401(k) account and had maxed out credit cards.

Kim Campbell of Citizens Insurance said in court that he told her he worked as a Northville firefighter for about a year and a half before the city terminated him in September 2018. He became self employed and worked as a snow plow contractor

While attending a Christmas concert Nolan also allegedly approached a personal acquaintance who works for another insurance company about who would get the insurance money and how would the payout happen if a house burned.

Those who investigated the case also testified that Nolan was living with his girlfriend in Canton when his township home burned. The home had spent a few months on the market.

Nolan told at least two of those testifying that he had returned to his township home briefly at about 6:45 p.m. New Year’s Eve just to check on a basement sump pump.

His truck’s infotainment system placed him there between 6:52 and 7:20 p.m. a window of opportunity if he wanted to prepare the home for arson prosecutors asserted.

Michigan State Police investigator Jason Mercier testified that he smelled gasoline when he visited the destroyed home. He found evidence of gasoline in several places including on carpeting a couch and a basement shelf.

Gregory Lotoczky of the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosive testified that he was talking to Nolan inside the home’s kitchen area when the former firefighter led him to a landscaping brick that suggested a forced entry.

Nolan appeared for his preliminary examination in a jail jumpsuit. He seems to be having medical issues with Lowe at one point asking if he needed to lay on his back.

The case against Nolan has involved Michigan Attorney General investigators who emphasize that fire ignited in three separate unconnected areas of the home gas vapors were ignited with an open flame a human caused the fire and Nolan’s truck was outside the residence less than two hours before a neighbor called for help.

Defense attorney Adam Clements said during his closing statements that given the duration of the investigation there should have been more evidence against his client.

“A reasonably cautious person would say ‘Nope that’s not enough.’” he told Lowe.

Lowe lowered Nolan’s bond from $250000 to $50000.

Reacting strongly to Mallikarjun Kharge's letter to INDIA allies alleging discrepancies in voter turnout data and stating that the credibility of the Election Commission of India is at ""an all-time low"" the poll panel has accused the Congress president of making baseless allegations to ""create confusion misdirection and impediments in the conduct of free and fair polls"".

In a sharply worded and unprecedented response issued on Friday the Election Commission (EC) said that Mr Kharge's letter was in the form of internal correspondence within a political grouping and yet he had made it public - a reference to the Congress president posting it on X. Condemning his question: ""Could this be an attempt to doctor the final results?"" the panel said it could create an anarchic situation besides doubts and disharmony.

The Congress has termed the ""content and intent"" of the response a ""permanent blot"" on the reputation of the institution. Senior Congress Leader Jairam Ramesh said the party would take up Mr Kharge's letter and the response during the scheduled meeting of INDIA allies with the Election Commission on Friday.

The response of the Election Commission of India (ECI) to the issues raised by the Congress President in his letter to the INDIA parties is simply beyond description. The EC is a Constitutional body entrusted with the responsibility of being an impartial body that ensures and is… — Jairam Ramesh (@Jairam_Ramesh) May 10 2024

Addressing the allegations levelled by Mr Kharge - who is also the Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha point by point - the EC called them ""insinuations and innuendos"" and an ""aggression on vitals of live election operations"".

On the key claims in Mr Kharge's letter - that the voter turnout increased by around 5.5% in the first phase and about 5.74% in the second phase and that the data's release was delayed - the EC said there was no delay and pointed out that the updated turnout data has always been higher than what was released on polling day. The commission backed up this claim by releasing a ""factual matrix"" of figures from elections beginning with the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.

""The very premise that voter turnout data was released late is devoid of facts as it has always been available on the voter turnout app. The commission has not changed the design or periodicity of displaying voter turnout data in any manner. Needless to add that polling station wise data of electors and voters is given to agent of the candidate on the day of poll itself at close of poll"" the EC wrote.

'Tend To Create Disharmony'

On the Congress president's other charge that some media reports had claimed that the final registered voters' list for the next phases had not been made public the panel said that he would know ""as a senior parliamentarian a very seasoned politician... and as the head of a prominent National Political Party"" that the EC follows a transparent process of preparation of electoral rolls.

This it said is made stronger by the participation of political parties and candidates at every stage of the process ensuring that parties know the number of electors at every stage of the electoral cycle.

Expressing its displeasure with the post the panel wrote ""Commission wishes you to appreciate that your comments/ observations/ allegations given in the aforesaid post borders on vitiating the constitutionally mandated work of ECI.""

""Through innuendos and insinuations the contents of the post tend to create disharmony in respect of the delicate space of election management can plant doubts in the mind of the voters and political parties and potentially creates an anarchic situation when you said ""could this be an attempt to doctor the final results?"" which this Commission hopes you do not have any intention of. Commission has faith that all stakeholders in Indian elections and most importantly the people of India will hold these observations of yours in equal contempt (sic)"" it said.

'Safeguard Democracy'

In his letter Mr Kharge had alleged that the credibility of the Election Commission of India was at an all-time low and it had ""perhaps for the first time in history"" delayed the release of the final voting percentages of the first and second phases of the Lok Sabha elections.

He said the Election Commission had earlier published voter turnout data within 24 hours of polling and wondered what had changed this time and why there had been no clarification. ""Is there an issue with the EVMs"" Mr Kharge had asked.

Listing out other grievances and urging leaders of other INDIA bloc parties to hold the Election Commission accountable as well as safeguard its independence the Congress president said ""As the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA) it should be our collective endeavour to safeguard Democracy and protect the independent functioning of the ECI. All the aforementioned facts force us to ask a question - could this be an attempt to doctor the final results?

You need to get over your reclining seat rage,"Editor’s Note: Heather Poole is a flight attendant for a major US carrier and author of “Cruising Attitude: Tales of Crashpads Crew Drama and Crazy Passengers at 30000 Feet.” The views in this commentary are her own. Read more CNN Opinion.

CNN —

Last night on a flight from London to New York a passenger rang his call light and when my colleague walked over turned off the light and asked him if he needed something he simply pointed to the reclined seat in front of him.

Heather Poole courtesy Heather Poole

The flight attendant told him that his seat was also in the reclined position and then mentioned that the seat next to him — the aisle seat — was available and that he could sit there. The man said he didn’t want to move to the aisle seat because he wanted to sit by the window.

Sometimes there are no solutions to problems like this.

Another day another flight: “If you put your seat back one more time I’m going to punch you in the face” said an older woman to a teenage girl seated in front of her. The young girl’s eyes looked like they might pop out of their sockets.

While standing in the aisle pouring a can of Diet Coke into a cup of ice I told the aggrieved passenger that nobody was going to punch anyone and that if she said another word about it or did anything to anyone authorities would be called to meet the flight.

“He’s in my lap!” cried a different passenger on a different flight. This one sat in the window seat.

I looked at the woman and then at the man in front who was clearly not in her lap. He was close though about a foot away. Sorry I mouthed. I handed her a can of club soda and a cup of ice and communicated to her in words I knew she’d understand: “Unfortunately he’s allowed to be in your lap.”

Besides lack of wifi or a broken entertainment system flight attendants hear more complaints about reclined seats than anything else.

The heart of the problem is that airlines are packing too many seats too closely together into a tight space. Remember legroom? But this squeeze doesn’t give passengers the right to react in such a way that the crew feels the need to divert a flight to have a passenger removed. That’s a really big deal that usually ends up with someone in police custody.

While I dread these altercations I think some passengers need to chill out — people have the right to recline their seat. Nobody has to ask for permission to recline their seat. Some people believe passengers have to put their seats in the upright position during the meal service. This isn’t true. At least not with US carriers even though it’s a nice thing to do.

A recliner is allowed to recline and there’s nothing anyone can do about it. Heather Poole

A recliner is allowed to recline and there’s nothing anyone can do about it. If you kick the seat or threaten to punch someone in the face you’ll be the one removed from the flight — not the person who moved their seat back two inches.

Not all airlines are created equal. Yes some airlines are taking away the recline option on all seats but these are mostly low-cost carriers which should tell you something about what those passengers want: cheap flights … including seats that don’t recline. (A friend who often flies Air France on short and medium-hop routes in Europe tells me that their seats are all locked upright. “I’ve never seen anyone get worked up about it” he said.)

Airlines are desperate to cut costs. It’s rumored that American Airlines removed a single olive off of business class meal trays and saved $40000 a year. So you’d think that 150 lighter seats per flight will certainly save an airline a ton of money. Remember the recline mechanism in the seat makes it heavier which increases fuel costs for the airline. A lighter seat that doesn’t recline is also a seat that is less likely to break which saves an airline money in repairs.

Non-reclining seats are nothing new. Major carriers have always had a few seats that don’t recline. Think exit rows and the last row. While some passengers aren’t always happy to get one of these seats it never seems to be that big of a deal.

But after 28 years in the job I’ve found there’s some basic reclining etiquette that makes for a smoother flight for everyone.

A reminder: chances are the person in front of you has no idea they’ve crossed that mental barrier between you and the rest of the world. You can’t kick them or scream at them but you can politely ask if they’d mind putting their seat back up. I bet if you ask nicely they’ll do it.

If you’re a passenger who likes to recline it’s always a good idea to be mindful of the situation that we are all collectively in and do so slowly. Yanking the seat back too quickly could make a mess if the person behind you has their tray table down.

Sure everyone feels cramped in coach seats. But the bigger you are the tighter the squeeze so consider glancing back before you adjust your seat. If it’s Shaquille O’Neal behind you maybe give the guy a break.

We do see spilled drinks and from time to time broken laptops. Seasoned business passengers know what to expect and book seats with more legroom. But on coach middle seat passengers struggle to type because there’s no arm space. The table is so much smaller these days and there’s barely room for a drink. So if you think you’re going to work on your laptop and balance a cup of coffee on that table well you might need to seriously rethink your spatial judgement.

If there’s one thing I’ve learned flying the unfriendly skies it’s this: you can’t please everyone. Somebody is going to suffer somebody is going to have a miserable flight somebody will be assigned the last row or a middle seat or will have to come into contact with a child. Now I’m going to tell you what I used to tell my son when he was little every time we traveled together: there’s no crying in flying. Toughen up.

Really this isn’t a war on reclined seats. This is about space and most airlines give you the option to purchase more space. So remember that next time you’re searching for the cheapest flight.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjQvMDUvMDkvZmxvcmlkYS1hLW0tYmFja3MtYXdheS1mcm9tLWR1YmlvdXMtMjM3bS1kb25hdGlvbi0wMDE1NzIzNNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Florida HBCU backs away from dubious $237M donation,"“With regards to the gift and the processing of it and so forth in terms of future processing we’ve already decided it’s in our best interest to put that on hold” Robinson said during the meeting.

The alleged windfall donation to FAMU came from Batterson Farms Corporation’s Gregory Gerami and the Isaac Batterson Family 7th Trust and would’ve almost tripled the school’s endowment helping students and faculty for generations. But after the announcement was made — with major fanfare during a Saturday commencement ceremony — skepticism quickly quelled the celebration.

For one Batterson Farms Corporation appears to be a relatively small outfit based in Texas selling hydroponic hemp farm products leading some to question how its stocks could be worth millions. The doubts have been heightened by reports about Gerami’s past dealings including a $95 million donation to Coastal Carolina University in 2020 that was terminated by school officials only weeks after it was publicly announced.

FAMU foundation members raised these points during Thursday’s emergency meeting while venting frustrations about how school staff transacted a nine-figure donation without telling them or the board of trustees. Some board members claimed to have learned about the donation from the university’s press release or from friends after graduation. The board of trustees had already called a special meeting for next week to discuss the donation before Thursday’s shock announcement.

“How did we get this far without knowledge of the transaction or the donor?” asked Chekesha Kidd a foundation member who is co-founder and CEO of Kinumi a concierge service.

School leaders — including Robinson and Shawnta Friday-Stroud FAMU’s vice president for university advancement — said they were barred from discussing the gift publicly due to a non-disclosure agreement. They defended accepting the donation from Batterson Farms Corporation noting the potential upside should the company go public. Batterson Farms did not respond to a request for comment about the potential future value of its stock.

Still the shares could be worth “$500 million or it could be zero” Laurence A. Humphries a member of the foundation’s board noted at the meeting.

“Yes there is clearly risk and we are seeing that in everything that has shaken out” Friday-Stroud said during the meeting. “But at the time that was the decision.”

FAMU did not reach out to Coastal Carolina University as they vetted Gerami’s gift officials confirmed Thursday.

That failed donation was one of several red flags that should have been raised during the vetting of FAMU’s gift according to finance experts.

The gift would have been paid out over the next decade according to an agreement obtained through a records request Thursday by the Tallahassee Democrat. The agreement shows that Gerami “donated 14 million shares of stock of intrinsic value worth at least $239000000 and will donate an additional $61000000 over 10 years” — valuations that don’t match what the school announced only days ago.

The agreement though does not specifically name a company and it’s unclear where and how the stocks were valued.

“Where does this valuation come from?” Rebel Cole a professor of finance at Florida Atlantic University said in an interview. “It raises more questions than it answers. If I were a dog my hackles would be up.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9vcGluaW9ucy8yMDI0LzA1LzA5L3Jmay1icmFpbi13b3JtLWtlbm5lZHktc2F0aXJlLXBldHJpL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Opinion | I'm the worm that ate part of RFK Jr.'s brain and I'm asking for your vote,Good afternoon fellow Americans from the interior of Robert F.

The controversy stems from erroneous bonuses doled out to senior executives last summer and fall as part of the $117 million Critical Skill Incentive Payments program authorized by Congress. Money from that fund has been given to more than 13000 staffers with high-demand skills in an effort to keep them in VA hospitals and benefits offices.

Last September VA leaders acknowledged that about $11 million was given to 182 senior VA leaders who should not have qualified for the bonuses. In a statement a department spokesman said investigators found no legal wrongdoing in the matter and attributed the improper payments to administrative mistakes.

However a VA inspector general report into the errors released Thursday blamed the errors on “breakdowns in leadership and controls at multiple levels of VA” including insufficient communication about bonus plans from Veterans Health Administration leaders and poor oversight by the department’s legal team.

House Veterans’ Affairs Committee Chairman Mike Bost R-Ill. called those findings disturbing.

“During oversight visits across the country we have consistently heard from VA police officers medical supply technicians housekeepers and other VA staff about the need for VA to better retain quality employees” he said in a statement.

“Instead of using all of the critical skill incentives to do this VA inappropriately used the money to line the pockets of VA executives to the detriment of VA’s workforce and the veterans they serve.”

Bost promised a full investigation into the matter by his committee saying the evidence so far indicates that the errors were “not some type of administrative mistake.”

The inspector general report specifically singled out leaders in the Veterans Health Administration and Veterans Benefits Administration but not VA Secretary Denis McDonough who did not learn about the improper payments until last September.

In a statement to the inspector general’s office McDonough agreed with recommendations to strengthen incentive pay administration within the department and said he hopes those reforms can be implemented by the end of September.

But he also pushed back on assertions of malfeasance by other department leaders calling the mistakes issues of “timing miscommunication and inadvertence.”

In a statement Thursday VA press secertary Terrence Hayes noted that “as soon as VA identified this error we immediately cancelled and began recoupment for all payments made to career senior executives at VA headquarters. We also began instituting additional reviews and stronger controls for all CSIs awarded to all career senior executives paused all awards ... and referred the matter to VA’s inspector general.”

He also said that officials will “continue to work to ensure that everyone who receives a [bonus] meets the criteria to do so.”

VA officials have already announced plans to recoup all of the improper bonus payments. Investigators said they do not have a full accounting of those efforts yet but noted the pullback of the money “negatively affected employee morale” and led to the early retirement of at least three senior officials.

New Marriott CEO Comments

New Marriott CEO Anthony Capuano was applauded this week by Ben Schlappig of One Mile At A Time for his candor. There’s some merit to that but like Lucky I am more than disappointed to hear management’s approach:

“I think we’ve made terrific progress. The integration of Marriott Rewards and SPG was a monumental task. And it’s quite interesting. You hear SPG loyalists say ‘My goodness what have you done to our program?’ The program was very guest-friendly. It was less owner-friendly. What some of those SPG loyalists may have lost a bit in terms of the richness of the program we hope that breadth of choice whether it be brands or geography is a bit of a mitigating factor.”

Marriott really has two customers the travelers that stay in their hotels and the hotel investment companies that manage their properties and choose to stay within the brand or convert to another. It’s hard to reach out to both but Capuano has clearly chosen which customer he wishes to endear.

More Fairfields and Fewer Upgrades

In more news this week Suite Night Upgrades a perk for top-tier loyalists is no longer available at all-inclusive properties. Imagine spending 250 nights/year on the road in busted Courtyards to redeem free nights for your family only to discover that the Cancun resort with the huge buffet doesn’t qualify for a little bit bigger room despite living in Marriott hotels all year.

Capuano stated that where SPG loyalists traded “richness” for breadth he was really saying “upscale” for “anywhere.” There is a valid point to that argument. The sole criticism of Hyatt is a lack of properties and SPG had just a few hundred that weren’t either beat up Sheratons or Four Points by Sheraton. As it stands today the great Marriott brands that come to mind: St. Regis JW Marriott Ritz-Carlton account for relatively few of the properties in the brand (about 4%.) Of the 7000 properties under the Marriott flag almost 40% are Courtyard Fairfield or Four Points brands.

However that trade doesn’t seem even to me. I don’t want more Fairfields in exchange for fewer benefits.

Marriott Has Lost Control of its Properties

The real problem with the Marriott Bonvoy program and its affiliate hotels is that the brand is too large to hold any control over the product and keep participating hotels within the reigns of its own terms and conditions.

I have expounded over the last couple of years on the decoder ring loyal Bonvoyers need to take with them to their hotels just to know what benefits they should (but likely are not) receiving. Top Tier Ambassadors and Platinum members receive free breakfast at these properties but not those upgrades are honored here but not there.

In just the last week yet another property added an energy charge of 4%. As Gary Leff aptly pointed out this is a room charge increase outside of the bounds of a standard rate increase. I’d go further. The reason why airlines like Spirit Allegiant and Frontier can charge a fee (and pay fewer taxes on the revenue) is that it is optional and not part of the fare – there has to be a way to avoid paying it to qualify like my favorite Spirit Airlines trick. Unlike the optionality of where and how you book your hotel room or even method of payment surcharges an energy charge is unavoidable and patently absurd.

As a customer (now Gold formerly Platinum for several years) I have no idea what I will get when I check into a hotel. I have so little faith in the Marriott Bonvoy program and its leadership’s ability to deliver a consistent product that despite huge credit card signup bonus points I simply have no desire to earn and redeem points in the program. I love some of the brands (mostly SPG) but won’t even look at their properties anymore.

Other Deteriorations

Hilton has stated it will permanently change its housekeeping policy to limit visits to the room. In the current environment that seems permissible due to COVID and worker shortages despite record levels of open jobs and higher wages for those jobs. There was a change to its free continental breakfast benefit for Gold and Diamond guests which in a way is more flexible (doesn’t have to be used for breakfast) but falls short (allotments are not enough to offset the cost of a single meal.)

IHG in an effort to maintain its superiority as the worst possible value for hotel points jacked-up prices during the pandemic. Just a couple of years ago its top-level redemption was 50000 points but the brand tested 120000 before backing back down.

Hyatt remains a loser in the race to the bottom which makes them a winner to me.

Conclusion

It’s not just rogue hotels that are dragging Marriott down it’s the message from management. If the Marriott team thinks the way to recruit and maintain consistent top-tier travelers is by watering down benefits and adding more Fairfields they are sorely mistaken.

The All-Inclusive by Marriott Bonvoy portfolio currently includes 25 properties across destinations including Antigua and Barbuda; Barbados; Mexico; the Dominican Republic; Jamaica and Saint Lucia.

That includes the debut of the new Delta by Marriott Riviera Nayarit an All-Inclusive Resort expected in August the company’s first Delta in the region and the world’s first-ever Delta All-Inclusive property.

And this portfolio is as diverse as it is vast: travelers can find everything from the luxe adults-only boutique all-inclusive The House in Barbados to the Royalton Antigua  home to some of the most sought-after overwater bungalows in the wider Caribbean.

A Marriott all-inclusive in Negril Jamaica.

“We are excited to see our All-Inclusive expansion from Mexico and the Caribbean into Central America as well as South America” Alex Fiz Area Vice President and Managing Director Caribbean and All-Inclusive at Marriott International told Caribbean Journal. “The eight Marriott brands that will be expanded to all-inclusive will give the consumer what they are looking for – our service culture trusted brand experience and a tailored option for every type of traveler – from adult only to family.”

And that diversity goes beyond resort sizes and destinations.

Marriott has launched a broad foray into all-inclusive with a focus on four categories: adults-only family vacations; romance weddings and honeymoons; and solo adventures with resorts geared to every kind of traveler.

A room at The House in Barbados.

For adults that means options to escape to “romantic adventures in exotic destinations” with a focus on wellness fashion and music; for family vacations the emphasis is on adventures for all ages — kids and teens’ clubs “cutting-edge family accommodations including shared living spaces” and fun dining concepts.

Marriott is also making a big push into weddings romance and honeymoons from beach weddings to recreation-filled honeymoons.

And in a welcome development Marriott is also acknowledging solo travelers — a category sometimes underrepresented in the broader all-inclusive space.

The Colony Club resort in Barbados.

“We want to offer guests a wide array of options and empower every traveler to explore their kind of dream vacation at distinctive international resorts” says Fiz. “From authentic local dining experiences to thoughtful programming for all ages and cultural excursions curate your memories in your own style.”

Marriott International’s entry into the all-inclusive segment kicked into high gear at the end of 2019 with the company’s acquisition of the sought-after Elegant Hotels portfolio which includes six all-inclusive resorts on the western and southern coasts of Barbados.

That expanded earlier this year with the announcement that a collection of Blue Diamond signature branded resorts would be joining the Marriott portfolio.

It’s a significant step for Marriott and a nod to the growing importance of the all-inclusive category for travelers particularly in the Caribbean.

Marriott also has more all-inclusive properties on the way with plans to open new all-inclusive resorts in destinations like Curacao and Jamaica. (You can find out more here).

In other words the world’s largest hotel company is officially all in on all-inclusive. And that means all-inclusive has a whole new meaning.

It used to be that most Marriott properties merely required a guest to be a federal employee to take advantage of a federal government rate. Now it seems they uniformly require the guest to be on official business when staying at this (frequently deeply discounted) rate. This matches Hilton’s approach.

This is bad news for a lot of federal government employees who not only got great rates when traveling for work (saving the taxpayer money the U.S. federal government is in many cases the single largest buyer of travel) but also as a perk for their time off too.

From a business perspective a ‘federal leisure rate’ can make a lot of sense.

Federal employees have discretionary income (so a good market to target) but generally aren’t wealthy (so discounts matter).

A hotel can generate incremental business with a discount for federal employees without undercutting the prices they charge to other customers.

However hotels are filling up in the U.S. You might look at comparable occupancy statistics and say that the hotel business still hasn’t fully recovered to 2019 levels and that’s true. But weekend business generally has. In other words in leisure markets leisure stays are back – and beyond 2019 levels. However mid-week business stays are suffering – and averaging the two together the hotel business isn’t yet back to where it was pre-pandemic.

In any case there’s no reason to offer deep discount inventory to stimulate extra room sales to government workers taking a weekend getaway since hotels are in many cases filling these rooms at much higher prices. There’s no longer a need for a policy of ‘looking the other way.’"

We expect to start credit card issuance in the next 90 to 120 days” Prashant Kumar MD & CEO of Yes Bank said in a concall with the media after disclosing the first-quarter earnings.Earlier this month the Reserve Bank of India imposed restrictions on Mastercard Asia / Pacific Pte Ltd (Mastercard) from on-boarding new domestic customers (debit credit or prepaid) onto its card network from July 22 2021 after it was found to be “non-compliant with the directions on Storage of Payment System Data.”When asked if the bank was aware that Mastercard was still non-compliant with RBI’s data storage norms and could face regulatory action Prashant Kumar said “it was news to us” in response.According to Nomura Yes Bank will be among the most impacted bank as its entire credit card scheme is aligned with Mastercard.The bank said that its 987000 credit cards in force will not see any impact from the ban on Mastercard nor will its debit cards. Since its credit card scheme was linked entirely with Mastercard its credit card issuance will be temporarily hit until its tie ups with other card issuers like Visa and Rupay are operationalised. Yes Bank also said that there would be no short-term impact of the ban on its balance sheet.“Apart from usual challenges of technology configuration authorisation settlement and other processes which need to be integrated with the bank there is also a shortage of chips globally which makes in general issuance of these cards difficult” Macquarie said in a recent note adding that card issuance may be hit for the industry over the next two months.Other banks have also initiated talks with card issuers like Visa and RuPay after Mastercard was placed under restrictions. RBL Bank earlier disclosed to exchanges that it has entered into an agreement with Visa to issue credit cards which could take upto 8 to 10 weeks.“RBL Bank currently issues credit cards on the Mastercard network only. The debit and prepaid cards issued by the Bank are already enabled on other payment networks in addition to the Mastercard network. Separately RBL Bank Limited(“RBL Bank”) has entered into an agreement with Visa Worldwide Pte. Limited (“Visa”) yesterday to issue credit cards enabled on the Visa payment network. RBL Bank expects to start issuance of credit cards on the Visa payment network post the technology integration which is expected to take 8 to 10 weeks” RBL Bank had disclosed to exchanges.“In the interim our Bank’s current run rate of approx. 100000 new credit card issuances per month could potentially be impacted till such time that there is clarity from the regulator on issuing new credit cards on the Mastercard network or till the technical integration with Visa is complete. As of date RBL Bank has approx. 3 million credit card customers and is the fifth largest credit card issuer in the country with approx. 5 percent market share” RBL Bank further said.Federal Bank too said it had started the process of technical certification with both Visa and Rupay. “We plan to issue Visa and Rupay backed credit cards in the next two months..We are hopeful that Mastercard will be able to resolve its issue with the regulator..We should have things in place for our cards business by September” said Shyam Srinivasan MD & CEO of Federal Bank while addressing the media after disclosing the bank’s earnings today.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL2RvbWluaWNhbnRvZGF5LmNvbS9kci90b3VyaXNtLzIwMjEvMDcvMjQvZG9taW5pY2FuLXJlcHVibGljLWFtb25nLWNvdW50cmllcy13aXRoLWhpZ2hlc3QtZGVtYW5kLWZvci1haXItdHJhdmVsLWluLWxhdGluLWFtZXJpY2Ev0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dominican Republic among countries with highest demand for air travel in Latin America,"ACCORDING TO A REPORT BY MASTERCARD ECONOMICS INSTITUTE

Mastercard produced the Recovery Insights report that indicates that in Latin America and the Caribbean the preference for road trips stands out; in terms of air travel the consumers with the highest demand are from the Dominican Republic Colombia and Mexico; the further study revealed slight signs of recovery in the business tourism industry.

The report prepared by Mastercard Economics Institute builds on aggregated and anonymous sales activity across Mastercard’s global network to better understand the next phase of travel its drivers and its challenges.

This includes the balance between leisure and business local and long-distance travel and also between savings and spending. In addition the report analyzes the spending categories that are experiencing an uptick and what this indicates in terms of travel recovery.

The main trends for Latin America and the Caribbean are:

Local road trips are becoming a big trend in 2021 as more and more people travel around their country to enjoy smaller places close to beaches and mountains. Among the countries that are experiencing an increase in gasoline spending are Argentina (+28%) Brazil (+31%) and the Dominican Republic (+39%) compared to January 2019.

Pre-pandemic booking levels have been surpassed by travelers from the Dominican Republic (+29% of air spending); Mexico (+35%) is experiencing a similar situation led by those traveling during spring break and Colombia is also experiencing a significant uptick (+12%).

Business travel bookings have been making at a slower pace than leisure travel. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 corporate travel was represented in Mexico (-10%) the Dominican Republic (+2%) Colombia (-7%) Brazil (-57%) and Argentina (-63%). However it is interesting to note that travel by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) has recovered faster than in large companies. These figures are significant considering that SMEs tend to spend less on flights hotels and restaurants than large companies.

The limited reopening of borders has proven to be a challenge for travelers and the tourism sector. Still some open corridors such as the Dominican Republic to the United States and Mexico to the United States are reaching and in some cases surpassing pre-pandemic levels.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vZ3Nwb3J0LmNvLnphL21hc3RlcmNhcmQtZ29sZGVuLWxpb25zLXdvbWVuLWNsYWltLWZpcnN0LWRpdmlzaW9uLXRpdGxlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mastercard Golden Lions Women Claim First Division Title,"Excitement was all over Emirates Airline Park rugby stadium on Saturday 24 July 2021 as the Mastercard Golden Lions Women claimed the First Division title beating the Free State.

He has held the position of CEO since 2010 which was when he was promoted from his previous position of COO. Since his promotion Banga has had an enormous impact on Mastercard and beyond. Here are 10 things that you may or may not have known about Ajaypal Singh Banga:

1. He Is Sikh

Banga is Sikh which should come as no surprise for people who are familiar with Sikhism. First his full name includes Singh which isn't exclusive to Sikhs but is nonetheless very common among them because of the tenth Sikh Guru. Furthermore Banga wears the turban that is supposed to protect uncut hair while maintaining a trimmed beard. The latter practice isn't traditional but has nonetheless started seeing widespread use because of convenience and other reasons.

2. Born in Khadki in Maharashtra

In 1960 Banga was born in a town called Khadki which is situated very close to the city of Pune in the state of Maharashtra. He was born there because his father was an army officer who was posted there at the time.

3. Has Some Pretty Illustrious People in His Family

It is interesting to note that Banga's father went on to become a general in the Indian Army. Furthermore his older brother Manvinder Singh Banga went on to become a CEO as well though he is now a senior partner at Clayton Dubilier & Rice.

4. Went to Hyderabad Public School

Banga was a a student at a private school called Hyderabad Public School which was established in 1923 for the purpose of educating the sons of the elite. Curiously it has turned out not one not two but three CEOs of famous companies with the other two being Shantanu Narayen and Satya Nadella at the heads of Adobe and Microsoft respectively.

5. Has an Interest in Social Development

It has been said that Banga has a strong interest in social development issues. As a result when he was at Citibank from 2005 to mid 2009 he played an important role in its approach to microfinance. For those who are unfamiliar with the term microfinance is focused on providing financial products and services to people who are underserved by banks and other financial institutions. Due to this small loans to the very poor can be counted as microfinance but so can checking accounts and savings accounts meant for that same clientele.

6. Has Experienced Prejudice

Having money helps but at the end of the day it isn't a perfect insulator from prejudice. In Banga's case he has related a story about four men in a vehicle who called him a member of the Taliban and other made other bigoted comments while he was crossing the street in Turkey.

7. Believes in Taking Such Incidents In Stride

Banga has stated that he believes in taking such incidents in stride instead of letting them get to him. Ultimately he prefers thinking that the overwhelming majority of people do not set out to be prejudiced towards others. Moreover he prefers thinking that the overwhelming majority of people would instead be sympathetic towards those who are on the receiving end of such poor treatment.

8. Believes in the Importance of Diversity

On a semi-related note Banga has voiced his belief in the importance of diversity in workplaces. Even ignoring the ethical reasoning this makes plenty of practical sense as shown by Banga's follow-up statement that being staffed by people with the same backgrounds same experiences and same mind-sets can cause companies to miss out on opportunities that other people with other circumstances could have seen coming.

9. Visits Countries Where Mastercard Operates

The Mastercard CEO's stance on diversity makes particular sense because of the worldwide nature of the corporation's operations. To make himself more capable at leading such operations Banga often visits countries where Mastercard operates for the purpose of familiarizing himself with the Mastercard employees working there.

10. Has Called Cryptocurrency Junk

Banga has outright called cryptocurrency junk on one occasion. As far as he is concerned cryptocurrencies aren't real currencies because they are not suitable for use as a medium of exchange. Partly this is because they have to be mined by people and partly this is because their value can see such wild fluctuations."

Despite a spirited defensive effort and some stellar saves from goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher Sweden broke through for the opening goal midway through the first half and added two more after the break to end the second-longest unbeaten streak in USWNT history at 44 games.

The U.S. returns to action on Saturday July 24 for what is now a crucial second Group G match against New Zealand. Kick-off from Saitama Japan is set for 7:30 a.m. ET on NBC Sports Network Telemundo NBCOlympics.com and Telemundo Deportes App.

Sweden which put in a tremendous overall performance proved dangerous from the game’s opening kick earning a number of good chances off set pieces on the counter attack and from pressing the USA but Naeher made a number of nice saves to keep things level. In the 25th minute Sweden broke things open when forward Stina Blackstenius headed home a well-placed service from Sofia Jakobsson.

The U.S. responded almost immediately with a nice attacking combination from Rose Lavelle Alex Morgan and Tobin Heath but Heath fired her shot wide after threatening near goal. Shortly after left back Crystal Dunn made an impressive goal-saving tackle in the 30th minute on Jakobsson as she drove towards Naeher in the box.

Sweden held the advantage in corner kick opportunities for the entire evening finishing with nine to the USA’s three and converted one of their chances just after the break. Blackstenius netted her second of the night in the aftermath of a corner in the 54th minute.

The USWNT created number of chances down the stretch with Lavelle launching a beautiful cross-field long ball for Carli Lloyd who drove down the field but fired her shot off the foot of a retreating Sweden defender in the 61st. Perhaps the USA’s best chance of the night came 10 minutes later when some great build-up got the ball to the forward Christen Press but she hit the woodwork from close range.

Sweden’s Lina Hurtig scored its final goal in the 72nd minute to put a cap on the evening. Press had another chance in the first minute of stoppage time but a nice save from Sweden goalkeeper Hedvig Lindahl preserved the clean sheet.



GOAL SCORING RUNDOWN

SWE – Stina Blackstenius (Sofia Jakobsson) 25th minute: After threatening throughout the early part of the game Sweden broke through in the 25th minute. Defender Hanna Glas found Jakobsson on the run down the right flank and she sent a well-placed service into the six-yard box. Her cross found the head of Blackstenius at the near post who got a step on defender Abby Dahlkemper and put it past goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher and into the back corner of the net. USA 0 SWE 1

SWE – Stina Blackstenius 54th minute: Jonna Andersson served up a corner kick for Amanda Ilestedt whose header ricocheted off the woodwork. Lurking near the back post the rebound fell right to Blackstenius who directed a half-volley into the roof of the net from close range to double Sweden’s advantage. USA 0 SWE 2





SWE – Lina Hurtig (Hanna Glas) 72nd minute: Jakobsson and Glas combined for a nice give and go on the right flank with Jakobsson sending Glas streaking downfield. Just outside the penalty area she sent a soaring cross in to Hurtig just inside the six-yard box. A glancing header from Hurtig sailed into the top right corner to cap off Sweden’s scoring. USA 0 SWE 3







ADDITIONAL NOTES

The USA’s record against Sweden now stands at 23-7-12 and 1-1-1 at the Olympics.

The loss ends the USWNT’s undefeated streak at 44 games the second-longest in team history. The run trails only a 51-match unbeaten streak from Dec. 2004 to Sept. 2007.

It’s the USWNT’s first defeat under head coach Vlatko Andonovski who is now 22-1-1 in his first 24 games (two at the end of 2019 nine in 2020 and 13 so far in 2021).

Andonovski’s lone draw also came against Sweden on April 10 in Stockholm.

It’s the USA’s first game without a goal since July 27 2017 vs. Australia in Seattle Wash.

Goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher defenders Abby Dahlkemper and Tierna Davidson as well as midfielders Rose Lavelle Kristie Mewis and Samantha Mewis made their Olympic debuts.

Lindsey Horan and Carli Lloyd are the only two players to appear in all 13 matches for the USA so far in 2021.

Lloyd earned her 17th Olympic cap surpassing Julie Foudy Kate Markgraf Kristine Lilly Joy Fawcett and Hope Solo for the second-most Olympic appearances in USWNT history.

The loss was the USA’s worst-ever defeat in an Olympic match and largest loss since falling 4-0 to Brazil in the semifinal of the 2007 FIFA Women’s World Cup.

Standing between the Group B winners and a trip to the semifinals is Jamaica the team that finished 2nd in Group C and has played the USMNT in the last 3 Gold Cup knockout stages. Jamaica beat the USMNT in the 2015 Gold Cup semifinal while the USMNT won in the 2017 final and the 2019 semifinals.

Accordingly this will be a very intense match that feels like a semifinal. The United States will hope to move onto Austin but they’re going to have to play their best match in this tournament to get past the Reggae Boyz.

What To Watch For

Neutralize the physicality. When the USMNT beat Jamaica 4-1 back in March head coach Gregg Berhalter said after the match that he challenged his team to neutralize the physicality that Jamaica usually brings. That has to happen again tomorrow. Showing Jamaica that they can also be physical and still execute will frustrate Jamaica just like it did back in March. If that happens the USMNT will have a clear advantage.

Dominate possession. Back in March the USMNT had 69% possession against the Reggae Boyz. It may be a lot to ask them to do those kind of numbers again but dominating possession keeps the flow of the game headed downfield for the Americans. The onus is on the midfield to make sure that possession stays with them and to set up the attack.

Be much cleaner on defense. The defense looked quite shaky against Canada at different points during the match especially when Walker Zimmerman had to sub off due to injury. Since he has departed the team due to that injury the defense need to accept the challenge and clean up the mistakes they had last Sunday.

Lineup Prediction

There are a lot of ways that Gregg Berhalter can go with his lineup but this seems to be what is most likely to occur out of the 4-3-3:

Matt Turner is the #1 at goalkeeper for this tournament so he’ll be the starter the rest of the way. The back line has 4 players this time with Sam Vines at left back and Shaq Moore back at right back and Miles Robinson and James Sands forming the centerback pairing.

In the middle Berhalter goes with the players he trusts to help neutralize the Jamaican attack and send the ball moving foward. Kellyn Acosta operates as the 6 with Sebastian Lletget playing as the 8. Cristian Roldan is in the middle in the hopes that he can spark the attack.

The front 3 are really 3 #9s. Daryl Dike and Matthew Hoppe are put out on the wings with Gyasi Zardes in the middle. If Paul Arriola is good to go you could see him enter as a substitute. Nicholas Gioacchini could be a late match option as well.

The crucial final game in Group G kicks off at 3 a.m. ET from Kashima Soccer Stadium in Kashima Japan on USA Network Telemundo NBCOlympics.com and Telemundo Deportes App.

Playing with pace and a crispness that was absent in the first game the USA controlled the match over the 90 minutes and Lavelle gave the USA an early lead that they would never relinquish in just the ninth minute. The goal was Lavelle’s first in the Olympic Games.

The U.S. was in control the rest of the first half and Carli Lloyd Heath Megan Rapinoe and Horan all appeared to have scored for the USA with goals during the run of play but all four were correctly disallowed for offside in the build-up.

Despite the Americans controlling the match three minutes before halftime forward Hannah Wilkinson created a quality opportunity for New Zealand. The forward was able to slip behind the U.S. backline and get on the end of a well-placed service from midfield but her header was inches wide of the right post. It would prove to be the Kiwis best chance of the game outside of their goal.

Less than a minute later Horan got her goal off a corner kick. The goal was Horan’s first ever in the Olympic Games and she became the seventh USWNT player to score during her 100th cap.

In the second half the U.S. scored its third off a New Zealand own goal. The Ferns pulled one back in the 72nd minute after a misplay in defense but the Americans would score three more times to pump up its goal difference heading into the Australia match.

The U.S. slammed the door shut with goals from second-half substitutes Press in the 80th minute and Morgan in the 87th minute and another own goal by New Zealand in extra time provided the sixth and final goal of the night.

The goal for Press was her first in Olympic play while Morgan’s was her sixth in the Olympic games.





GOAL SCORING RUNDOWN

USA – Rose Lavelle (Tobin Heath) 9th minute: After a good build-up Lindsey Horan passed the ball across the top of the box to Heath who hit a one-time through ball into the right side of the box for a streaking Lavelle. With her first touch the former Wisconsin Badger slipped her shot past goalkeeper Anna Leat for her first Olympic goal. USA 1 NZE 0

USA – Lindsey Horan (Julie Ertz) 45th minute: With the first half coming to a close the U.S. doubled its lead off a Megan Rapinoe corner kick. Rapinoe sent her cross to back post and Ertz broke free from her marker to smartly headed the ball back across the front of the goal to a waiting Horan who headed home from close range. USA 2 NZE 0





USA – Abby Erceg (Own Goal) 63rd minute: Horan sent in a cross to Carli Lloyd in the box and she headed it back across the goal for a streaking Heath. New Zealand defender Abby Erceg had positioned herself between Heath and the goal but accidentally knocked it into her own net. USA 3 NZE 0

NZE - Betsy Hassett (Paige Satchell) 72nd minute: The Football Ferns pulled one back after a misplay by the U.S. defense. A long ball was sent down the right sideline that Abby Dalhkamper attempted to clear away but instead mishit. Satchell was able to win the ball in the box draw out U.S. goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher and then find Hassett who took one touch before burying it into the open net. USA 3 NZE 1





USA – Christen Press (Julie Ertz) 80th minute: Julie Ertz provided the service for the USA’s fourth goal when she sent in a ball from the right sideline for Press. Press took two touches one to control the pass and then her next was a banger past the New Zealand goalkeeper and into the lower right corner. USA 4 NZE 1

USA – Alex Morgan (Christen Press) 87th minute: Press found her fellow substitute Morgan for the fifth goal of the night. From the left flank Press whipped in a cross that teased Heath but then found Morgan in the penalty area. She took a settling touch before striking her shot on the ground into the left corner of the net. USA 5 NZE 1

USA – CJ Bott (Own Goal) 90+3 minute: Press streaked down the left side to get on the end of a long ball and looked to cross it back into the box but Bott stuck her foot out and mistakenly directed it into the net. USA 6 NZE 1



ADDITIONAL NOTES

The USA’s record against New Zealand now stands at 16-1-1 and 4-0-0 at the Olympics.

England and Manchester City captain Steph Houghton says Team GB's football squad have decided to take a knee during the Tokyo Olympics.

Great Britain's women's football team have confirmed that they will take a knee before their matches at the Olympics in support of the fight against racism and discrimination.

The decision comes after the IOC relaxed its Rule 50 which had previously forbidden athletes from protesting at all times but now allows peaceful protest prior to competition with sanctions still threatened for any protests made on the medal podium.

A team GB statement said: ""The Team GB Women's Football squad have confirmed their intention to take the knee on the field of play ahead of kick-off in their games at the forthcoming Tokyo 2020 Olympic Football tournament in Japan.

""The squad welcomed recent clarification provided by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in relation to Rule 50 which now permits athletes to make gestures on the field of play provided they are done so without disruption and with respect for fellow competitors.""

Houghton says Team GB's players have had lots of conversations about taking a knee

Steph Houghton and Kim Little who have been confirmed - along with Sophie Ingle - as joint Team GB captains for the tournament explained that the squad had reached the decision as a collective and following extensive discussions with the British Olympic Association (BOA).

England and Manchester City captain Houghton told Sky Sports News: ""We've been taking the knee in our club matches in the WSL and previous international matches and we knew as a squad this was something that we wanted to talk about first and foremost - it's not just a quick decision we've had lots of conversations.

""We've obviously been looking forward to the rule 50 that the IOC have put on the Olympic Games. For us we had to discuss what we wanted to do and it was something that we felt as a squad we wanted to do 100 per cent. We had lots of conversations with the BOA who have been really really supportive.

""Ultimately for us taking the knee allows us to show the support for people's lives that are effected at this moment in time and for us to try to improve the discrimination and inequality that is currently not just in football but in the world today.""

Scotland captain Little said the spotlight provided by the women's football tournament being one of the first Olympic competitions to start gave additional motivation to the players to take a stance.

""Our want is to show solidarity and continue to highlight the systemic racism and discrimination that is part of our society and by taking the knee continuing talk around it to help make changes and create a more equal society"" Little told Sky Sports News.

""Because we are the first sport to take the field of play we wanted to show that message and put it on that platform to highlight the changes that are needed.""

Mark England Team GB Chef de Mission for Tokyo 2020 says he supports the women's football team taking the knee at this summer's Olympic Games.

Team GB's chef de Mission Mark England told Sky Sports News that the team had been ""disgusted"" by the racial abuse suffered by England players following their Euro 2020 loss to Italy.

England said: ""We want to present an opportunity for our athletes to express themselves to make sure that those causes that they feel strongly about and certainly the women's football team here feel very strongly about the online abuse and about the racism Kick It Out campaign and about taking a knee and we absolutely support them in that.""

Trio of captains confirmed

Team GB also confirmed on Thursday the joint captaincy of Houghton Little and Ingle who will skipper Hege Riise's side on rotation throughout the tournament.

Great Britain begin their Group E campaign against Chile in Sapporo on Wednesday before matches with hosts Japan and Canada.

Riise said: ""We are fortunate to have so many experienced and talented players in our squad and we think of ourselves as a 'leaderful' team where every individual brings their own leadership strengths to the group.

""However Steph Sophie and Kim will lead the way on the pitch. This is a very close group on and off the pitch and I have been so impressed how they have all come together.""

Houghton who captained England to the semi-finals of the 2019 World Cup admits it will be a slightly different dynamic to what she's used to with the 33-year-old also skipper at Manchester City.

""Of course it's a bit different to what I've been used to at England and Manchester City"" Houghton said. ""So it might take a while to get used to the format and what happens on matchday but ultimately it won't change the way that I am and the way that I lead on the pitch and off the pitch with the girls.""

Little who is captain of Arsenal and Scotland's vice-captain says it will be an ""easy"" adjustment for her to share the load.

Sophie Ingle says being made captain provides 'important' representation for Wales

""For me it's definitely an easy thing to adjust to"" Little said. ""My mindset on it is yes someone has to wear the armband but it's a team of 11 on the pitch and also the substitutes and ultimately how we get a result is us all working together so that's definitely how we feel as a team and obviously how Hege wants to work.""

Chelsea midfielder Ingle who captains Wales felt the fact that representation in terms of the captaincy had been spread across Great Britain provided an important message.

""I think it's really important and it just shows that it doesn't matter if you're not English you can still get in the team"" Ingle said. ""I think if you put your head to it and obviously work hard throughout the season then the rewards come at the end and I'm just honoured to represent Wales as well as GB alongside some of the girls here.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoYW5uZWxzdHYuY29tLzIwMjEvMDcvMjUvdG9reW8tb2x5bXBpY3MtZHRpZ2Vycy1sb3NlLW9wZW5pbmctZ3JvdXAtYi1tYXRjaC10by1hdXN0cmFsaWEv0gFpaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2hhbm5lbHN0di5jb20vMjAyMS8wNy8yNS90b2t5by1vbHltcGljcy1kdGlnZXJzLWxvc2Utb3BlbmluZy1ncm91cC1iLW1hdGNoLXRvLWF1c3RyYWxpYS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tokyo Olympics: D’Tigers Lose Opening Group B Match To Australia,"Nigeria’s senior men’s basketball team the D’Tigers have lost 84-67 to Australia in their opening Group B match at the Tokyo Olympics.

Two weeks ago in Las Vegas the Boomers were 39 points better than Nigeria but in today’s encounter at the Saitama Super Arena Coach Mike Brown’s team got off to a good start but in the crucial stages of the match poor shooting let them.

Both teams combined for 46 turnovers with Australia contributing 22. The first quarter was a tight affair it ended 23-23 and the direction of the match was hinged on the second-quarter performance.

Australia won it 20-17. Nigeria lost seven free throws easily they would have taken the lead into the break.

In the third quarter the arena’s buzzer couldn’t function properly and that affected the momentum of the game. Notwithstanding the Boomers got their shooting right Nigeria struggled with theirs and lost the quarter 15-12.

In the 4th quarter Patty Mills took things personally with exceptional shooting and the Boomers won 26-15 to wrap up a fine performance with defense being the main focus for coach Brian Goorjian’s team.

Mills was Australia’s best performer with 25 points while Joe Ingles and Dante Exum recorded 11 apiece. Nigeria’s Obi Emegano had 12 points Josh Okogie finished the game with 11 points while Jordan Nwora and Precious Achiuwa recorded 10 points each.

The D’Tigers will hope to make amends when they take on Germany in their second group match on Wednesday 28th July."
MKC,McCormick & Company,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRhaWx5YmVhc3QuY29tL3RydW1wLWJhY2tlZC1zZW5hdGUtaG9wZWZ1bC1kYXZlLW1jY29ybWljay1oYXMtZXh0ZW5zaXZlLWRlZXAtc3RhdGUtdGllc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Trump-Backed Senate Hopeful Dave McCormick Has Extensive 'Deep State' Ties,"As he runs for U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania Dave McCormick’s claims to his “home state” have been a source of contention on the campaign trail: the Republican hedge fund titan spent much of his youth in Pennsylvania but has lived out most of his recent adult and professional days in Connecticut.

While the extent of McCormick’s ties to his “home state” are cloudy his ties to another state—the “deep state”—seem far more clear.

Despite his claims to the MAGA movement McCormick is steeped in the nexus of government intelligence and big business that Donald Trump and his acolytes ambiguously refer to as “the deep state.”

Those connections range from colleagues to boards to corporate investments with additional ties to notorious surveillance systems and an internal monitoring project at McCormick’s firm—the legendary hedge fund Bridgewater Associates—that was directly modeled after the Chinese Communist Party’s autocratic surveillance state.

And in the mind of Trump who is McCormick’s most crucial political ally some of those ties would be about as problematic as a MAGA Republican can get—such as for instance former FBI Director James Comey.

Comey it turns out accepted a senior role at Bridgewater the year after McCormick signed on as the fund’s president. As general counsel Comey oversaw an internal security program whose invasive and sometimes demeaning methods of surveillance and interrogation earned him a reputation as Bridgewater’s “in-house inquisitor.”

Aside from Comey the most prominent of McCormick’s “deep state” affiliations is his recent three-year run as a paid trustee of the secretive government-backed investment group In-Q-Tel—quite literally the Central Intelligence Agency’s very own venture capital firm.

McCormick’s role at In-Q-Tel appears on his candidate financial disclosures where he listed the entity’s name as “IQT.” Tax filings from In-Q-Tel which is registered with the Internal Revenue Service as a nonprofit show that McCormick joined as a trustee in March 2018 and left in 2022 as he pursued his first Senate campaign. He collected an annual $35000 salary logging five hours of work a week according to the tax records and his election bid has since seen hundreds of thousands of dollars in support from executives tied to IQT and its investments.

For McCormick his deep state connections embody the larger political contradictions he’s already been forced to reconcile as a corporate Republican seeking office in the quasi-populist era of Trump.

That tortured balancing act failed two years ago. In the 2022 GOP primary in Pennsylvania the lifelong moderate failed to land Trump’s endorsement—losing that honor and subsequently the GOP primary to Mehmet Oz.

While McCormick got the coveted Trump endorsement this year—though there weren’t any other viable Republicans running in the primary—the dissonance is starker than ever.

Today the MAGA wing of the Republican Party finds itself fully enthralled with conspiracy theories about the intelligence community which Trump and his allies have for years cast as public enemy No. 1. Trump is vowing retribution as a key 2024 campaign plank.

Given that McCormick’s challenge to Sen. Bob Casey (D-PA) will be one of the most contentious races of the 2024 cycle the hedge funder turned true MAGA believer may have to work harder than expected to scrub his deep establishment ties in order to appeal to his new base.

A former colleague of McCormick’s at Bridgewater told The Daily Beast that McCormick was “an honorable man” a “stand-up guy” and an “independent” and “brilliant leader.” But the colleague also put his finger on the Trump issue calling it a “sad reality” that McCormick will have to cave to the whims of the former president.

“He knows that if he wins he won’t get to do what he thinks is right” the person said. “He has his own money and he won’t be so susceptible to outside pressures financially. But he’s still going to have to kiss the ring and that’s unfortunate.”

McCormick’s campaign did not respond to detailed questions for this article.

It’s not clear if Trump knew about McCormick’s work with the U.S. intelligence community including the CIA and Comey. But as it turns out the deep state overlaps in myriad ways with McCormick’s 13-year tenure as a top executive at Bridgewater.

In 2010—the year after McCormick left George W. Bush’s Treasury Department to sign on as Bridgewater’s president—Bridgewater hired Comey who would later come to embody the darkest of Trump’s paranoiac accusations about federal agents.

Bridgewater brought Comey on officially as head of security and general counsel. In practice however Comey’s role more closely resembled that of an “in-house inquisitor” over the first iteration of the firm’s oppressive internal employee monitoring program which would later come to be called “The Politburo.”

Before he led the FBI unleashed a bombshell on Hillary Clinton in the 2016 campaign and got fired by Trump Comey reportedly raked in $7 million per year at Bridgewater. His task was to keep employees in line with the goals of what firm founder Ray Dalio called “radical transparency.” Those efforts included constant surveillance—including recorded meetings and videotaped internal “trials” of employees—with Dalio telling Bridgewater staff that Comey was “like a godfather adjudicating it all.”

The taped meetings were “just the tip of the surveillance ecosystem” at Bridgewater Vanity Fair reported in its profile of Comey’s time with the firm.

“A slew of ex FBI agents staffed the security team. Not only did cameras cover seemingly every inch of the property but they seemed to be watched in real time. Staffers who left their desks even briefly would return to sticky notes left on their computer monitors admonishing them for failing to put up a screen saver” Vanity Fair reported.

Comey would go through employee cellphone and computer records and was apparently so intrusive that he embarrassed one executive into resigning.

But when Comey’s security posse only turned up “little evidence of actual offending behavior to snuff out they created their own” according to Vanity Fair.

In one instance the report said Comey left an executive’s binder clearly labeled and unattended in Bridgewater offices. He then watched as surveillance cameras captured a low-ranking employee discovering the binder and going through it. Comey put the employee on trial and fired him with the approval of Dalio.

Comey however eventually found himself repelled by Dalio’s extremes resigning after two years. (This month Comey happens to be publishing a murder mystery novel that takes place inside a fictionalized version of Bridgewater.)

Dalio however only ramped things up implementing more and more intrusive policies to fully enact his “radical transparency” dogma.

That program it turns out was literally modeled on the Chinese Communist Party’s social surveillance program which Dalio openly admired. He even named the project after the CCP’s own “Politburo” and compared it favorably to “Big Brother” in a 60 Minutes interview.

China of course is another area where McCormick is against the prevailing GOP winds as Bridgewater’s internal culture “reflects aspects of Chinese political ideology” and invested heavily in the region—after McCormick took over as co-CEO in 2017 the fund’s Chinese investments skyrocketed.

The “Politburo” staffed up with officials from the National Security Agency and the CIA. But Bridgewater workers found it “intimidating” and “humiliating” and so intrusive that in 2017 one whistleblower filed a human rights complaint with the state of Connecticut where the fund is headquartered which was covered at the time in The New York Times.

As detailed in a recent book about Dalio titled The Fund the Politburo essentially pitted its employees against each other assigning roles like “auditors” and “overseers” and recording practically every moment of activity—all in pursuit of Dalio’s core “radical transparency” philosophy.

While the system repelled many employees—including Comey and one-time CEO Jon Rubinstein who both left after disagreements with Dalio—McCormick stayed aboard got a promotion and publicly defended Dalio’s “radical transparency.”

Rubinstein quit after a “firing squad” meeting that McCormick personally sat in on according to the book where Rubinstein made the case that Dalio’s increasingly authoritarian policies were creating a “climate of fear.” When McCormick one of a handful of senior executives in the room was personally asked if he agreed with Rubinstein’s take he said he did not according to the book.

McCormick has subsequently defended Dalio. In 2020 when McCormick was asked if he took issue with a fundamental contradiction at the core of the monitoring program—“radical transparency” within the company but kept secret from outside scrutiny—he replied that he “doesn’t think it’s inconsistent at all.”

“Ray has always said this: Radical transparency is not total transparency. There are certain things that we’re not transparent about and consciously so. Personnel and salary discussions for example” McCormick said.

Shortly after rising to co-CEO McCormick joined the board at IQT.

The venture capital nonprofit which former CIA Director George Tenet founded in 1999 has funneled hundreds of millions of dollars in public funds to hundreds of technology firms and startups some of which are still secret.

Today IQT oversees more than $1 billion in assets and even has its own special-purpose acquisition company. Though the group keeps a low profile IQT maintains a close relationship with government intelligence and security divisions and runs “almost all investment decisions” by the CIA.

Many IQT investments seek to cultivate the private development of surveillance technology that could one day benefit the intelligence community and some of them overlap with both Bridgewater and McCormick.

One of those companies is Palantir a tech firm closely tied to right-wing financier Peter Thiel whose sprawling government work has made it a lightning rod for civil rights controversy—and whose fate was “rescued” by IQT’s investment.

Bridgewater itself helped fund Palantir and incorporated Palantir technology to advance its own investments as well as to help monitor Bridgewater employees in the fund’s pursuit of Dalio’s “radical transparency.”

Palantir executives have contributed thousands of dollars to McCormick’s 2024 campaign.

Additionally one of IQT’s current trustees Howard Fox who also served on the board with McCormick has put serious money—more than $150000—behind McCormick’s candidacy in both 2022 and this cycle.

The same is true of other McCormick supporters like the CEO of Tenable an IQT-backed tech firm which announced its public stock offering shortly after McCormick joined the board.

And while it’s true that McCormick brings his own money to the table that hasn’t stopped Bridgewater donors from chipping in. In all Bridgewater employees mostly executives have contributed about $100000 to McCormick’s political aspirations with current president Kyle Delaney throwing $50000 to a 2022 super PAC backing his old colleague.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wb3N0LWdhemV0dGUuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9zdGVlbGVycy8yMDI0LzA1LzEwL25mbC1kcmFmdC1uZXdzLW1hc29uLW1jY29ybWljay1zb3V0aC1kYWtvdGEtc3RhdGUtbWF0dC16aW1tZXIvc3Rvcmllcy8yMDI0MDUxMDAwMDHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Will Mason McCormick contribute to the Steelers' OL in 2024?,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vcmdhbmZoLm5ldC9vYml0dWFyeS9qb3NoLW1jY29ybWlja9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Obituary | Josh McCormick of Huntington West Virginia,"LEWISBURG WV - Joshua Howard McCormick 38 of Huntington WV formerly of Lewisburg WV passed away May 3 2024 at home.

The ad promoting the former hedge fund CEO will run for four weeks beginning on cable broadcast and digital platforms in the Pittsburgh Scranton Harrisburg and Johnstown markets.

McMormick's campaign aims to make his military service a constant theme in his campaign against Casey who's seeking his fourth six-year term in the Senate.

McCormick is making his second run for the Senate. In 2022 he lost in the GOP primary to Mehmet Oz who went on to lose to Democrat John Fetterman in the midterm election.

Between the lines: The McCormick ad's focus on ""duty honor and country"" echoes an ad his official campaign put out last week.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vc3RlZWxlcnNkZXBvdC5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS9jaGFkLXJldXRlci1iZWxpZXZlcy1tYXNvbi1tY2Nvcm1pY2stY2FuLWNvbXBldGUtZm9yLXN0YXJ0ZXItc25hcHMtYXMtcm9va2llL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chad Reuter Believes Mason McCormick Can Compete For Starter Snaps As Rookie,"The Pittsburgh Steelers made it an emphasis to improve their offensive line in the 2024 NFL Draft selecting Troy Fautanu Zach Frazier and Mason McCormick with three of their first five selections. While Fautanu and Frazier seem likely to start on Day 1 or at least early in the season McCormick to this point has been viewed more as depth across the interior offensive line. However NFL Media draft analyst Chad Reuter believes McCormick could potentially take over a starting spot at guard for the Steelers and believes the three rookie starters might be an improvement over last season’s offensive line.

“McCormick has the toughness and athleticism to take a starting spot from James Daniels or Isaac Seumalo. Yes that potentially means the Steelers would start three rookies on the offensive line but some Steelers fans might argue McCormick left tackle Troy Fautanu and center Zach Frazier will quickly constitute an improvement over last year’s group despite their lack of experience.”

I find it very very hard to believe that the Steelers would bench one of Seumalo or Daniels for McCormick. While there were some down moments for the most part the two were steady last season and among Pittsburgh’s best offensive linemen. Seumalo in particular brings leadership to a line that will still be very young and it’s really hard to fathom McCormick getting starter reps as a rookie.

Now could he compete with Nate Herbig for the top backup job at guard and potentially win it? Sure but even then McCormick is likely waiting for an injury to get his reps. The more realistic scenario here is that McCormick serves as depth and potentially as the team’s backup center behind Frazier as they worked him out at the position before the draft and he becomes a viable starting option after 2024 when Daniels’ contract will be up. The guard market got expensive in free agency this offseason and Daniels might be looking at a number the Steelers don’t want to pay. McCormick becomes insurance against them overpaying to keep Daniels around should he want a lot of money.

The selection of McCormick was an awesome one to help bolster Pittsburgh’s line depth and add a bully on the offensive line and it’s continually been praised since the draft concluded. But given what the Steelers currently have at guard it’s just hard to fathom the team benching two experienced starters who have been good in Seumalo and Daniels for McCormick. That doesn’t mean McCormick won’t one day be a starter but I’d be shocked if it happened in 2024 without injuries."

(Bill Roth / ADN)

Part of a continuing weekly series on local history by local historian David Reamer. Have a question about Anchorage history or an idea for a future article? Go to the form at the bottom of this story.

Anchorage residents love their chain restaurants though some have difficulties being honest with themselves. Area residents also cherish the wide variety of locally owned and unique eateries. But every fast-food opening is accompanied with massive crowds and long lines that linger for weeks. People went crazy when the first Dairy Queen in town opened in 1952 and they went crazy when Krispy Kreme opened in 2016 even though there were already existing ice cream and donut options. The Sonic coming soon in South Anchorage will prove this point all over again.

[Related: Anchorage residents go a little nuts when national chains arrive in town. It’s been happening since sliced bread.]

Among all the chains McDonald’s holds a special place in the hearts of many Alaskans and within Anchorage history. The first McDonald’s in Alaska opened in Anchorage on July 2 1970 at Arctic and Northern Lights Boulevards. This arrival marked Anchorage’s ascension to a new stage of relevance long before Walmart Costco Subway Starbucks Taco Bell and Target made their way north.

More McDonald’s franchises in Alaska soon followed on DeBarr Road Old Seward Highway and in Fairbanks. In 1975 the fifth Alaska McDonald’s opened in downtown Anchorage. The 126-seat building was then the largest McDonald’s on the West Coast. The structure complied with building and planning codes by going with a muted design meant to blend in with the neighborhood primarily with the Alaska National Bank of the North location next door. There was no Ronald McDonald statue no massive roadside sign.

Ray Kroc (1902-1984) the former CEO and self-styled founder of McDonald’s was on hand for the opening. By this time he had retired from day-to-day operations but remained the public face of the company. This was his third trip to Anchorage his first coming in 1971 to celebrate the first anniversary of McDonald’s in Alaska. By all accounts he loved Alaska especially the food and scenery. During his 1975 visit he announced a $250000 gift for the Providence Hospital burn center.

While the billionaire often employed a self-deprecating wit he also tended toward self-aggrandizement a pattern best exemplified by his claim of founding McDonald’s. The McDonald brothers Richard and Maurice started with a single San Bernadino California restaurant and were already franchising the operation when Kroc convinced them to expand further. Seven years later Kroc leveraged them out of the company.

Kroc was also an uninhibited talker. If he thought something he’d say it regardless of social niceties which sounds more positive than it was to experience. After retiring as McDonald’s CEO in 1974 he amused himself as the heavy-handed owner of baseball’s San Diego Padres. A 1969 expansion team the Padres took a long path toward respectability. They didn’t finish with a winning record until 1978 and didn’t make a playoff appearance until 1984.

During an especially demoralizing performance in a 1974 game Kroc commandeered the public address system. “Ladies and gentleman I suffer with you” he announced. “This is the most stupid baseball playing I’ve ever seen.” In other words If Kroc was willing to denigrate his own business in the most public way possible nothing would prevent him from speaking his mind which sets the stage for his next visit.

In 1977 he returned to Anchorage. As might be expected he was generous with his thoughts uniformly negative thoughts about the city. He expressed some bile about the collection of bars and XXX shops that largely defined downtown in the Anchorage Times. “You got no class” he said. “Why don’t you guys get a bulldozer and clean out the whole mess and build something decent.”

He saved most of his venom for the downtown McDonald’s newest neighbor. The Sunshine Plaza also known as the Sunshine Mall opened in late March or early April 1977 directly east of the fast-food restaurant. The blocky bright yellow building looked about as it does now. Said Kroc “It’s just horrible. Where is the planning and pride of the city to allow such a terrible thing to be put up? The mayor should be tarred and feathered for allowing that.” Anchorage Mayor George Sullivan the Sullivan Arena namesake was out of town and made no later public comment regarding Kroc.

Sunshine Plaza architect Galen Grant was less than pleased by Kroc’s criticism. He could have either rolled with the punch in the near certainty that the comments would soon be forgotten or fought a billionaire in the court of public opinion. He chose the latter. In a letter to the Anchorage Times Grant wrote. “It’s a shame that those least qualified to act as architectural and planning critics are permitted to do so. Is ‘phenomenal hamburger success’ the license to judge.”

William Pargeter then owner of all Alaska McDonald’s franchises doubled down on Kroc’s sentiments towards Anchorage. In his own letter to the Anchorage Times Pargeter stated “Grant’s negative remarks are the only negative remarks regarding Kroc’s visit that I have heard and in fact 100 percent of the comments thus far have indicated that what was said needed to be said and we should listen carefully to see if we can’t increase the quality of our lives not only in the downtown Anchorage area but throughout the community.”

Grant of course was wrong about the nature of critics. Buildings are not made solely to be enjoyed by architects nor movies for actors or paintings for painters. Everyone is free to criticize everything regardless of experience or knowledge. The public can still be demonstrably wrong but they certainly have the right to their opinions about a building.

The arrogance of Grant’s response played a role in the tone of the debate. Subsequent letters to the newspapers indicate the nature of the discussion regarding Grant and the Sunshine Plaza at the time. Wrote one local “[Sunshine Plaza] looks like a collection of yellow Quonset huts and definitely detracts from the other buildings on the block. Not only is it gaudy but in its present location it lacks all artistic value. If I were an architect and had designed that ridiculous creation I certainly wouldn’t want anyone to know about it.” Another resident said “Virtually all who view the Sunshine Mall from down the block agree it is a garish mistake . . . how blessed that someone besides architects pass judgment on architecture.”

Worse the Sunshine Plaza also was a major disappointment to its developers. Like seemingly every mall in Anchorage history management struggled to obtain tenants for the new facility. Seattle-based though Anchorage-raised fine artist Jamie Bollenbach was in town during and after these events. For him the Sunshine Plaza “felt too big half alive.” “I remember long halls with nearly empty stores with small inventories that were gone the next time I came by” says Bollenbach. “I used it mostly as a windbreak at Rondy.”

Time moved on. Ray Kroc died in 1984. His autobiography “Grinding It Out” makes no mention of Alaska let alone Anchorage. The downtown McDonald’s eventually closed; the building now houses the Alaska Mint.

After a long and distinguished career in Anchorage Galen Grant is now a principal partner with FCGA Architecture based in Danville California. It has been more than 40 years since the Kroc-Sunshine Plaza kerfuffle. So it is understandable that Grant did not respond to inquiries for this article. In the end it was a tempest in a teacup a distracting bit of commotion. Coincidentally another Grant project recently returned to public focus the former Alaska Club on Tudor Road that the Municipality considered — then rejected — buying to house homeless services.

The Sunshine Plaza remains primarily unchanged. Anchorage architect Tim Conrad offers a current perspective on the building. The lifelong Alaskan and secretary/treasurer of the Alaska chapter of the American Institute of Architects says “I can see how some would criticize Sunshine Plaza. The bright yellow may assault the eyes of passersby. The curved glazing up on the top level may feel like a clunky form as if drawn by an 8-year-old. The back of the building faces Third Avenue a parking desert and uninspiring space that is further depressed by the full height of the building rising up into the bluff between Third and Fourth which blocks any possible warmth from the sun.”

Yet he adds “Sunshine Plaza sits boldly in an otherwise neutral environment. And for a location that sees its daily sun exposure dwindle to just under five and half hours in December why not let a building be a beacon of brightness vibrance and cheerfulness? In its mundane and neutral downtown ecosystem I believe the Sunshine Plaza effectively sets itself apart. It creates a place marker a known element and is an effective wayfinder for local and visitor alike.”

You drive through and you really don't care about anything but your fast food fix.

It's been a fine business model for a long time and rarely finer than during the pandemic.

Yet amid McDonald's increasing reliance on tech-driven drive-thru and delivery one issue seemed like it might disturb the firmament of success.

McDonald's was insisting that its franchisees owed it money for the fine technology that was driving business toward ever-higher revenues.

Every six months franchisees have to pay McDonald's a fee you see for all the latest innovations -- such as robot drive-thrus. Suddenly McDonald's was claiming that the fee had to paid monthly. Oh and that the franchisees were already in arrears.

Well technology is expensive isn't it?

Some franchisees insisted McDonald's didn't have it right. And by the way they said McDonald's didn't have the right tech anyway. This was all getting a little fraught.

So much so that just as McDonald's was experimenting with robot drive-thru ordering in Chicago franchisees were threatening to sue over the technology fee affair.

Naturally I eagerly looked out for the lawsuit. I desperately wanted there to be startling revelations about McDonald's use of technology especially its legendarily capricious ice-cream machines.

Instead this little snippet from Bloomberg: ""The fast-food giant decided to cut the charges by 62% from the original $68 million communicated to McDonald's franchisees in December.""

Wait so this had been rumbling along for more than six months before McDonald's suddenly conceived it might have its numbers in a twist?

Had McDonald's been counting its nuggets before they were hatched?

Please forgive me but I had to chuckle on learning that McDonald's called in the finely calibrated accountants at KPMG to tell them that maybe maybe these numbers weren't quite right. And lo suddenly both parties were issuing a joint statement saying how happy they were that the issue was settled.

This though wasn't the most entertaining part of this absurd little contretemps.

Not long before the technology fracas was finally put to rest McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski joshed that this whole thing was really all about a ""rounding error.""

No really. His actual words as presented by Restaurant Business: ""In the grand scheme of things those are rounding errors in the overall health of franchisees.""

So months and months of kvetching about poor technology silent sulking and threats of lawsuits all revolved about a rounding error?

Naturally I want there to be a moral for this story. As the world becomes ever more tech-driven I don't want any more conflicts than are necessary. In this case matters clearly became roundly personal which suggests relationship errors may have been committed.

Might I suggest that in future times McDonald's sorts out its tech-charging disputes with a bun fight rather than well this?"

The company announced numerous features that plan on making it to your Apple Watch with watchOS 8.

watch OS 8 Bluetooth Health device discovery

Among these watchOS 8 features is a less talked about feature in the Bluetooth settings section. Apple has now included a new ‘Health Devices’ feature in the Bluetooth settings. The central idea behind this new feature is to allow health devices to connect with your Apple Watch directly.

Currently most devices that you connect with your Apple Watch require you to use your iPhone. This new feature bypasses that step and allows for automatic discovery and connection of health devices.

Although Apple did not get into the details around this new feature during the WWDC event the implications of this change could be huge.

watchOS 7 Bluetooth vs. watch OS 8 Bluetooth connection

The core Bluetooth feature on watchOS 7 today allows for Bluetooth connection when the app is in the foreground or during a background session. This works well when a person wants to focus on an app to get information from its accessory.

However with watchOS 7 you cannot have a complication with information from an accessory. This complication is not updated with new data until users open up the app on their Apple Watch.

Some app makers such as Sugarmate have designed a clever way around this by taking advantage of the calendar complication on the Apple Watch.

Thankfully with watchOS 8 new changes device makers can design their apps to connect their Bluetooth accessory using background app refresh. This will now enable accessory makers to update their app complications with information from their accessories.

watchOS 8 uses a Bluetooth LE (low energy) connection to communicate with the accessory.

Potential for Dexcom G7 and Apple Watch direct pairing?

For starters take a look at the popular Dexcom app used by many to monitor their Blood Glucose measurements. Currently once you attach the glucose sensor to your body the embedded transmitter on the sensor communicates with your iPhone using Bluetooth.

Users then use the Dexcom app on their Apple Watch to monitor the blood glucose readings that are piped in from their iPhones.

This could easily change in the future with the new ‘Health device’ discoverability feature in watchOS 8’s Bluetooth settings.

The new Dexcom G7 transmitter and receiver are now powered with Bluetooth 5.2 / 5.1 instead of the older Bluetooth 4.0 / 4.2 that was common in the G6 platform.

If the new Dexcom G7 could communicate directly with your Apple Watch this would be a huge relief for many diabetes users who may not be required to carry their iPhone with them when they are out and about on a short walk or a bike ride.

The same holds for other Health devices that can directly communicate with the Apple Watch. You will no longer be required to carry your iPhone all the time.

Apple and Dexcom have worked together in the past and the Dexcom experience on Apple products is considered much better than the Android experience by many users.

We reached out to Dexcom for comments but did not hear any confirmation around how the company plans to take advantage of this new Apple Watch feature.

In Summary

This feature is new and health accessory makers will also need to account for power-related issues since the accessory will now draw on more power to support direct integration with the Apple Watch.

We may hear more about this when Apple unveils its Apple Watch Series 7 in the fall. The new Health Device Bluetooth feature is supported on older Apple Watch models. Given that this feature is pretty new we look forward to seeing if Apple announces any key health device makers that plan on offering this feature in their updated apps.",,,,,,,,,

Adjuvant treatment with Keytruda and chemotherapy—with or without radiotherapy—failed to hit the mark for disease-free survival (DFS) in newly diagnosed high-risk endometrial cancer patients who received surgery with curative intent according to an interim analysis of Merck’s late-stage KEYNOTE-B21 study. DFS refers to the length of time after a primary treatment ends that a patient survives without any signs or symptoms of their cancer.

The trial’s other primary endpoint overall survival was not formally tested because the Keytruda-chemo combo failed to reach statistical significance on the DFS metric Merck said in a Thursday release.

Merck says it’s continuing a full evaluation of the data and is working with investigators to share the results at a later date.

Endometrial cancer is the sixth most common cancer in women and the most common type of cancer in the uterus according to Merck. In the U.S. alone the company estimates roughly 67880 patients will be diagnosed with uterine body cancer this year. Merck also estimates there will be 13250 patient deaths from the disease in 2024.

“While these results were not what we had hoped we are focused on continuing to build on the established role of Keytruda in advanced endometrial carcinoma through our approved indications” Gursel Aktan M.D. Ph.D. vice president of global clinical development at Merck Research Laboratories said in a statement.

Merck will continue to test Keytruda-based combinations—plus other treatment approaches like antibody-drug conjugates (ADC)—in endometrial and other types of gynecologic cancers Aktan said.

Keytruda is already approved in patients with endometrial carcinoma that is microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR). The PD-1 inhibitor picked up that nod in 2022 following a 2017 approval that allowed the drug to cover previously treated MSI-H/dMMR tumors in patients without alternative treatment options.

Keytruda also boasts a second indication alongside Eisai-partnered Lenvima in previously treated endometrial cancer that’s not dMMR.

Over the past year Merck’s Keytruda has been sparring with GSK’s PD-1 rival Jemperli over endometrial cancer dominance in the clinic.

Last February just two months after Jemperli snagged a historic win for immunotherapy in first-line endometrial cancer Keytruda plus standard chemotherapy beat chemotherapy alone at staving off tumor progression or death in advanced or recurrent disease.

The following month at the Society of Gynecologic Oncology 2023 annual meeting both GSK and Merck provided a closer look at their meds’ late-stage performance in first-line endometrial cancer with Keytruda appearing to edge out Jemperli in MMR proficient (pMMR) patients—a key subgroup that Merck says comprises roughly two-thirds of all endometrial cancer cases.

GSK ultimately beat Merck to the finish line for a PD-1 nod in newly diagnosed disease with the company’s Jemperli in July snagging FDA clearance as an add-on to chemotherapy for patients with primary advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer but only for tumors that are mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H).

Meanwhile Merck and Eisai’s Keytruda-Lenvima combo in December missed the mark in a phase 3 study as a potential first-line treatment in certain patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma. The oncology cocktail failed to demonstrate an improvement in overall survival and progression-free survival over a regimen of platinum-based chemotherapy missing both of its primary endpoints.

While Keytruda climbed to the top of pharma's sales charts in 2023 the drug has experienced a series of clinical ups and downs in 2024.

The PD-1 inhibitor started out the year by delivering a partial win in a phase 3 study pitting the drug against high-risk localized muscle-invasive bladder cancer and locally advanced bladder cancer. Around the same time Keytruda bolstered its case as a postsurgical treatment for resectable kidney cancer with data showing it helped slash the risk of death by 38% versus placebo post-kidney removal in patients with clear cell renal carcinoma—the most common form of kidney cancer.

The drug also posted a win in cervical cancer in March. But that same month Keytruda in combination with Lynparza failed to improve patients’ life expectancy or delay progression or death when subbed in for the chemotherapy pemetrexed during maintenance treatment of newly diagnosed metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lunger cancer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJhcHMub3JnL25ld3MtYW5kLWFydGljbGVzL25ld3MtYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjAyNC81L3JlY29uLW1lcmNrLXMtZW5kb21ldHJpYWwtY2FuY2VyLXRyZWF0bWVudC1mYWx0ZXJz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Recon: Merck's endometrial cancer treatment falters in study; Novo signs $600M deal with Metaphore to develop new ...,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNsaW5pY2FsdHJpYWxzYXJlbmEuY29tL25ld3MvbWVyY2stdHJpYWwta2V5dHJ1ZGEtcmVnaW1lbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Merck's trial of Keytruda regimen fails to meet primary endpoint,"The safety profile of MSD’s Keytruda was in line with those in prior studies. Credit: Atmosphere1 / Shutterstock.com.

Merck & Co (MSD) has announced that its Phase III KEYNOTE-B21 (ENGOT-en11/GOG-3053) clinical trial of Keytruda plus chemotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed high-risk endometrial cancer following surgery with curative intent failed to meet its primary endpoint.

Sponsored by MSD the trial is being carried out in collaboration with the European Network for Gynecologic Oncology Trial (ENGOT) groups and the GOG Foundation.

The randomised double-blind study involved 1095 patients to assess adjuvant treatment with Keytruda plus chemotherapy irrespective of radiotherapy status versus adjuvant placebo plus chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy.

The primary endpoints are disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) and secondary endpoints include safety.

According to the data from an interim analysis by an independent data monitoring committee the Keytruda regimen failed to show DFS improvement versus placebo.

The secondary goal of OS was not tested due to the lack of superiority in DFS.

Keytruda’s safety profile was in line with those in prior studies without any new safety signals detected.

The comprehensive data analysis from the trial is currently underway.

Keytruda has existing approvals in the US for certain types of advanced endometrial carcinoma.

It is approved in combination with Lenvima for mismatch repair proficient (pMMR) advanced endometrial carcinoma patients after disease progression post-systemic therapy.

It is also approved as a monotherapy for MSI-H or mismatch repair deficient advanced endometrial carcinoma patients who have advanced post-systemic therapy and are not eligible for curative surgery or radiation.

Merck Research Laboratories global clinical development vice-president Dr Gursel Aktan said: “While these results were not what we had hoped we are focused on continuing to build on the established role of Keytruda in advanced endometrial carcinoma through our approved indications while rapidly progressing clinical research evaluating Keytruda-based combinations and other investigational candidates including antibody-drug conjugates in endometrial and other types of gynecologic malignancies.”

Earlier this month MSD reported the final analysis findings from the Phase III KEYNOTE-811 trial of Keytruda plus trastuzumab and chemotherapy to treat human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive locally advanced unresectable or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5ibG9vbWJlcmdsYXcuY29tL2lwLWxhdy9hc3RyYXplbmVjYS1tZXJjay1zdWUtdG8tc3RvcC1jb3BpZXMtb2YtY2FuY2VyLWRydWctbHlucGFyemHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AstraZeneca Merck Sue to Stop Copies of Cancer Drug Lynparza,"AstraZeneca Plc and partner Merck & Co. filed lawsuits alleging that copies of Lynparza proposed by Sandoz Group AG and Natco Pharma Ltd. infringe two patents issued in the past week for the blockbuster cancer drug.

Others switched to Telegram which was downloaded 11m times during the week following the privacy update.

The uproar came after millions of people misinterpreted WhatsApp’s new terms to mean more data would be shared with its parent Facebook. This wasn’t the case: the update to WhatsApp’s policy covers the way people communicate with businesses and the data shared with Facebook remains the same.

Yet the policy change and resulting backlash highlighted the large amounts of data WhatsApp can collect since its 2014 acquisition by Facebook. Spoiler: it is still a lot. But six months later WhatsApp is still by far the most popular messaging app with two billion users.

Other Facebook-owned companies collect and share even more data. Instagram’s privacy policy is almost identical to Facebook’s and the two can freely exchange information to serve you advertising.

So what data does Facebook actually get from WhatsApp and Instagram and is there any way of limiting the amount of information siphoned off to the social media giant?

What data can WhatsApp share with Facebook?

First things first. WhatsApp does not share the content of your chats with Facebook and this will not change after the terms of service update. The messages are private. Your messages – including photos videos and calls – are protected by end-to-end encryption so they can’t be read by law enforcement or WhatsApp itself.

Data WhatsApp can share with Facebook includes your phone number and profile name. In addition more detailed information underlying the message known as metadata including when it was sent and your IP address can be collected and shared with so-called “Facebook companies”.

The EU and UK are protected by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Data Protection Act which limits data sharing in these regions. WhatsApp claims metadata is only collected and shared in the EU for certain purposes such as if it is instructed to do so by law enforcement.

Metadata is a valuable tool to analyse the contacts between people says Rowenna Fielding founder and director of privacy consultancy Miss IG Geek. “When you look at metadata it turns out a lot of the time you don’t even need message content because patterns of activity tell you a lot about someone. This isn’t just ‘X is on Y’s phone’ it is ‘X is on Y’s phone and they are messaging each other every evening at around 8pm for an hour’. You can then start extrapolating inferences or relationships and build social graphs.”

WhatsApp says data is only shared with Facebook for purposes such as preventing spam and not for advertising. It outlines that WhatsApp does not share your contacts with Facebook for its own use and there are “no plans to do so”. WhatsApp also denies its data is used to inform Facebook’s People You May Know algorithm but the social network has come under fire for incidents such as the time it recommended sex workers’ clients add them as friends.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9zcG9ydHMvb2x5bXBpY3MtYmFkbWludG9uLWVneXB0cy10d28tZmVtYWxlLWNvbXBldGl0b3JzLWV4Y2VsLXZlcnNhdGlsaXR5LTIwMjEtMDctMjUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Olympics Badminton-Egypt's two female competitors excel at versatility,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/olympics-badminton-egypts-two-female-competitors-excel-versatility-2021-07-25/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9zcG9ydHMvb2x5bXBpY3MtYmFkbWludG9uLWVneXB0cy10d28tZmVtYWxlLWNvbXBldGl0b3JzLWV4Y2VsLXZlcnNhdGlsaXR5LTIwMjEtMDctMjUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8va29yZWFqb29uZ2FuZ2RhaWx5LmpvaW5zLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA3LzI0L2J1c2luZXNzL3RlY2gvUm9ibG94LUtvcmVhLW1ldGF2ZXJzZS8yMDIxMDcyNDA3MDEwMTA1Ni5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Metaverse monster comes to Korea real world not worried,"

Roblox established a Korean subsidiary on June 16. Its game is the most played in the world with user numbers growing fast but hoops and hurdles await Roblox in the Korean market.According to a filing Roblox establish Roblox Korea with 100 million won ($86700) of capital. It is based in Yeoksam-dong southern Seoul and headed by Mark Reinstra the general counsel at Roblox.Roblox is not a standalone game but allows users to develop their own mini games share them with others and change Robux game money into real-world money. The allowing of users to build their own worlds and make real money has made it the perfect example of a metaverse platform.The game is already available for download in Korea and its Korean user numbers are also rising but establishing a local presence could mean that it's opting for more action in the local market.Experts say that Korea has one of the best gaming cultures and infrastructure in the world making it the perfect testbed for developers and marketers. If it can make it in Korea then it's like to succeed elsewhere said Vanz Kim of Unity Korea a game engine provider.""Korea shows a strangely keen interest in the metaverse and to move into Korea would mean it can build momentum for growth"" Kim said. ""Roblox needs diverse content to expand beyond just a video game and Korean companies would have another choice on their hands in addition to Zepeto or ifland when it comes to promoting themselves in the metaverse world.""Experts however are not sure how much success Roblox will achieve in Korea either as a game or a metaverse platform.The game has already been around long enough to attract the users it can and Korean users often display different tastes in games compared to overseas users according to game critic and columnist Lee Kyung-hyuk.""Just because it's popular outside of Korea it doesn't mean it's popular here"" he said offering popular shooting game Fortnite as an example.Choi Sam-ha a professor of game design and marketing at Sogang University also said that it's ""meaningful that Roblox is setting up an office in Korea"" but still ""unlikely that it will make a big change in the gaming industry.""Heavy competition awaits Roblox.""Roblox would have to face Zepeto"" Choi said.Zepeto is currently the biggest metaverse platform in Korea. Choi pointed out that Roblox is really a game while Zepeto is a social networking platform which is why it’s so popular among young people.“Roblox would have to aim for the younger gamers but it's been around for more than 10 years and not new enough to attract people who already known about it” Choi said.Another major obstacle for Roblox is that the game’s biggest attraction the Robux is useless in Korea.According to the Game Industry Promotion Act “Making a business of converting into money or intermediating such conversion or repurchase of tangible and intangible results obtained through the use of game products by anyone” is illegal. So in Korea Robux only stays inside Roblox — which gives Zepeto the competitive edge over Roblox.“In Korea Zepeto is not classified as a game so people can easily spend money [within the metaverse platform] and possibly make profit in the future” said Lee Jung-yeop professor of Korean Culture and Contents at Soon Chung Hyang University who specializes in game design. “But Roblox is already serviced as a game. So even if it tries to expand in Korea its hands are tied which is why the news isn’t really a big deal in Korea.”All games hope for a change in the law that would allow games to use blockchain technology more freely within games and turn it into a profitable system for the users according to Prof. Lee. Since the company has just opene an office in Korea Roblox could be the change that the game industry needs to move onto the next phase of the metaverse race said Lee Yo-han of The Sandbox game another metaverse platform and video game popular in the world. The Sandbox is also preparing to open a Korean branch.""The metaverse market is still in early stage of formation"" said Lee. ""The government maintains a conservative attitude now but it's looking into how to deal with digital technology such as the metaverse or non-fungible tokens (NTF). The current situation could very well change with time.""Rather than seeing Roblox as competition insiders of the metaverse industry viewed the move as the metaverse pie growing in Korea and welcomed the news.""Microsoft opts for an open ecosystem and endeavors to expand the industry"" said Microsoft the operator of Roblox's long-term rival and video game Minecraft. ""We welcome Roblox's move to Korea and hope it will expand the metaverse industry in Korea.""Naver Z the operator of Zepeto also saw the move as an expansion of the market likening the metaverse industry to social media platforms.""We already have 90 percent of our users from abroad so we're not worried about user exodus"" said a spokesperson for Zepeto. ""With messenger apps people usually flock to one service. But the metaverse is like games and people enjoy different platforms not just one. It should be seen as a sphere of communication and interaction and we welcome the fact that consumers get a wider range of choices.""BY YOON SO-YEON [yoon.soyeon@joongang.co.kr]",,,

View the current offers here.

Want to live like a VIP for a few days? You can do it in Las Vegas — for the right price.

With about 150000 hotel rooms countless nightclubs and tons of entertainment options there are plenty of ways to live large in Sin City.

On a recent trip I decided to stay at the Aria an MGM property located in the heart of The Strip. Instead of a regular room though I was tasked with splurging for the exclusive Sky Suites section a hotel-within-a-hotel that's reserved for the Aria's nicest suites and highest paying guests.

With nightly rates for the Sky Suites section starting at more than $600 during a slow Monday night this cost more than four times the price of a standard 520-square-foot king-bedded room. But was the one-bedroom Strip-view penthouse really worth the splurge? Read on to find out.

Booking strategically to be extra VIP

If you're going to splurge you might as well do it the right way.

For me that started with booking the Sky Suites through the American Express Fine Hotels and Resorts program (FHR) which I can access on account of holding The Platinum Card® from American Express.

The nightly rates matched those of booking directly with the hotel but I'd enjoy some valuable additional benefits including:

Room upgrade subject to availability

Free breakfast up to $30 per person for the first two guests

Guaranteed 4 p.m. late checkout

Noon check-in when available

$100 food and beverage credit

That was not a bad way to enhance my Sky Suites experience at no additional cost.

Several other Las Vegas properties participate in the Amex FHR program though the ""regular"" Aria does not.

Just note that you won't necessarily earn any elite credit when booking through FHR. But for me the added perks far outweighed the World of Hyatt points I could've earned on my one-night stay.

If you do end up staying at the non-suite Aria you should consider booking through Chase's Luxury Hotel and Resort Collection (LHRC). You'll enjoy many of the benefits listed above just by making the reservation through Chase's portal. For more about LHRC read our detailed guide.

The concierge didn't deliver

When booking Sky Suites you're promised some pretty lofty perks such as ""effortless access to some of the city's most enticing offerings"" and ""preferred dining reservations."" It sounds a lot like they're rolling out the red carpet for you.

Well given the hype I was particularly disappointed with the concierge.

In the weeks leading up to my stay the hotel reached out and asked if I needed help planning activities and dining reservations.

I'd responded with a list of things to do — think seeing Mystère by Cirque du Soleil and eating at either é by José André or Nobu — just to see what magic the Sky Suites concierge could create. Everything I asked about was already sold out online.

Aside from snagging a prime-time reservation at Catch one of the Aria's seafood restaurants the concierge wasn't able to get me into any of the other activities or restaurants I'd asked about.

A bit of a tease I thought but I had already prepared for that answer. What was particularly frustrating was that I couldn't reach a concierge by phone without waiting for nearly an hour. Getting a response to my emails took nearly a day.

That left me wondering whether I'd receive a different response had I chosen the Skylofts at the MGM Grand which includes a dedicated 24/7 butler service and concierge. Suites there start at $800 just a couple of bucks more than the $750 I paid for the one-bedroom strip view penthouse suite at the Aria Sky Suites.

The grand entrance

It wasn't all a disappointment though. The VIP experience really began once I landed in Vegas. Waiting for me at the bottom of the airport terminal escalator was a chauffeur with my last name on her tablet.

Aria Sky Suites guests are entitled to complimentary round-trip luxury airport transfers. Just note that they need to be arranged before arriving in Vegas.

Once I identified myself and took the obligatory pictures I was escorted to the waiting Cadillac Escalade aptly called 37MLIFE a nod to MGM's loyalty program named M Life.

The ride from the airport took mere minutes — but I was grateful that I didn't need to wait for a rideshare or stand in the long taxi lane in the 110-degree heat.

The fun continued once we pulled up to the Aria. The driver buzzed a guard stationed at the gated side entrance and moments later the gate opened to a private driveway for Sky Suites guests.

Talk about a grand entrance that makes you feel special.

Lobby lounge

Another perk of staying in the Aria Sky Suites is access to the lobby lounge.

After being whisked from the car to the (long) check-in line I was told that I'd have complimentary access to the lobby lounge.

Here you'll find an assortment of bottled soft drinks including Pellegrino as well as coffee and tea machines.

For nosh there was a rotating selection of bite-sized hors d'oeuvres including cheese tarts and salami toasts.

Though the selection was a bit limited I really appreciated this perk especially as someone who likes to stay hydrated. Unless you're gambling getting a bottle of water or cup of coffee for under $5 at the Aria is seemingly impossible.

Nice rooms

Unsurprisingly the highlight of my Aria Sky Suites stay was the room itself.

The 1050-square-foot penthouse was decked out with three individual rooms: a large living room a four-person dining table with a wet bar and an inviting bedroom with an en-suite bathroom.

I particularly appreciated the furnishings — nothing felt too cheesy or too opulent which isn't ever a guarantee in Vegas.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 12 (Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11

There was a half bathroom right next to the entrance which came in handy when I had guests over.

Another feature I appreciated was the desk with a reclining chair — as more and more hotels abandon desks for more ""useful"" space I'm reminded of how much I appreciate those that continue to offer this amenity.

My top-of-the-line suite included a top-shelf minibar. It's just too bad the prices were well above my budget. (Think over $10 for a bag of almonds.)

As a tech-forward traveler I found the two in-room tablets quite useful. I could control the shades and lights as well as order room service and make dining reservations using the tablet.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 3 (Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy) 0 1 2

But above all else the highlight was definitely the views of The Strip. Though I was ""just"" on the 37th floor I had great panoramic views of nearby buildings including my personal Las Vegas favorite the airport.

Separate pool

In addition to the dedicated lobby lounge and private entrance Sky Suites guests are invited to use a dedicated Sky Pool.

Accessing the pool required flashing a room key and I was welcomed with a towel and bottle of ice-cold water in no time.

The pool itself was quite crowded during my late-June stay and I'd expect it to fill up during peak times on warm days.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 5 (Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy) 0 1 2 3 4

Finding a place to sit was nearly impossible since so many of the chaise loungers had already been reserved with towels and other personal belongings.

Of course Sky Suites guests can use the three other Aria pools but note that the chaise loungers are much more padded at the Sky Pool.

Everything else is shared with Aria

Beyond that don't expect much else outside the norm as a Sky Suites guest.

Other than the separate pool the remaining amenities are shared with the Aria. That includes both the gym and spa.

Of course the Aria is one of the MGM's top properties so even the gym is well equipped and the spa looks quite nice.

It's just important to note that you shouldn't expect a totally exclusive and separate experience as a Sky Suites guest.

If you're looking to avoid the crowds I'd recommend either the Waldorf Astoria or the Four Seasons neither of which has a casino in the hotel.

Carbone hits the spot

There are plenty of ways to ""do"" Vegas. One of my personal favorites is to check out all the top restaurants.

Carbone one of New York City's most popular Italian restaurants has an outpost in the Aria so I couldn't help but inquire about last-minute availability.

There was a seat left at the bar so I snagged it. Both my stomach and my wallet were happy about the choice.

The spicy rigatoni vodka ($32) was as heavenly as I remembered and the entire meal totaled $94 just a few dollars short of my $100 allotment from Amex Fine Hotels and Resorts benefit.

Where's the special service?

Vegas is back and so are the crowds.

Though you might be able to avoid them elsewhere prepare to wait at the Sky Suites.

It took nearly 30 minutes to reach a check-in agent and even though I arrived at 2 p.m. — just an hour before the promised check-in time — my suite wasn't ready yet. Aria knew what time I was arriving. After all the hotel did send a limo to pick me up.

I ultimately received my room key over an hour later but only after I waited in a long line once again. (The promised text notification never came through.)

Other service lapses included being woken up by housekeeping on my checkout day. Their manifest said that I'd already vacated the room despite specifically asking the front desk agent to program my key until the guaranteed 4 p.m. checkout time available via FHR.

And then there was the mystery bagel.

At 1:10 p.m. my doorbell rang and room service had a giant shopping bag. Inside was a $20 bagel. And some jam. OK it was really an $8 bagel but the random fees brought it up to $20.

The catch: I never ordered a bagel. Or anything else for that matter.

Why would a New Yorker ever order a bagel in Las Vegas? Let alone put jam on a bagel? But that's beside the point. There was a warm bagel jam cream cheese all for the cost of one hand of blackjack.

Too bad I can't report back on how it tasted. I left it in the room waiting for the next VIP guest to enjoy.

So was it worth it?

The next time I'm looking to splurge in Vegas I'm going to stay elsewhere.

Sure the ""hard product"" as it's called in airline parlance is great. The suites are well designed the limo service is a time saver and the private entrance makes you feel special.

But where the Sky Suites underdelivered was with the so-called VIP service. I still waited in plenty of lines and working with the concierge wasn't nearly as ""effortless"" as promised.

Of course the Aria could work on these kinks — especially as hotels on The Strip (and nationwide) deal with staffing shortages — but until then I'll save the cash and bet bigger at the blackjack table.

One is Terry Fator.

Liberty Loft is the most coveted Las Vegas Strip venue you don’t know about. Unless you are a Vegas entertainer looking for a unique showroom in a 2000-room resort.

The elevated venue at New York-New York is finally being put to the test as headlining venue with none other than Terry Fator moving into the room Aug. 11. The 11-year ventriloquial headliner closes his limited engagement at the former Zumanity Theater on Sunday night. His new residency went on sale Saturday with shows at 7:30 p.m. Wednesdays through Sundays (tickets run $49.99-$65.99 not including fees).

Reached Saturday Fator said he was unable to talk formally about his future with MGM Resorts International. He’s been with the company since 2008 when he opened at The Mirage. He was set up as a limited-engagement headliner at New York-New York Theater which will be home to a residency production likely by the end of the year.

For the uninitiated Liberty Loft is an elevator ride to great potential. The room overlooks the sportsbook at New York-New York located on the second floor above Tom’s Urban near the hotel’s Strip-facing entrance.

Over the past half-dozen years performers and producers have poked their heads into the venue reviewing its viability as a ticketed theater or showroom. Dating to 2015 Frankie Moreno kicked the tires when seeking a Strip residency. Mark Shunock checked the place out before he developed The Space as a community destination. Melody Sweets reviewed the room after she left “Absinthe” (Sweets famously mistook the sportsbook betting board as a Wall Street stock readout).

It’s easy to see the reason for all the interest. The venue has enough space to host a mid-capacity show of 400-500 seats. It sits in a busy hotel on the lucrative corner of Las Vegas Boulevard and Tropicana Avenue. A performer with an inventive mind could make Liberty Loft something special.

But MGM Resorts has never partnered with a performer or show. It’s made more sense profits-wise to keep the room available only as a revenue center for private events. The closest we have seen to a show in that space was the Cirque du Soleil One Night for One Drop pre-party in 2017 when the production itself was staged at Zumanity Theater.

The room could be cool if the ingress/egress issues are sorted out. The aforementioned elevator (well two of them) are the only means to access the venue. But Fator has always said he can shape his show to 50 or 5000. He’s looking at about 400 now upstairs with a Lofty opportunity.

Hammond Mohr postponed

COVID concerns have pushed back the July 30 comedy show co-starring Darrell Hammond and Jay Mohr at Notoriety Live at Neonopolis. Club proprietor Ken Henderson reports the two stars want to push the show back until the numbers are more forgiving. Column fave John Di Domenico is also on the show produced and hosted by Christine Peake and also featuring Vegas club comic Kris Shaw and the Russian model/actress/stand-up Eugenia Kuzmina.

Bruno not budging

Word out of Park Theater is Bruno Mars’ upcoming shows Friday and Saturday are still very much on. The superstar recording artist missed his shows over this weekend for “unforeseen circumstances” leading to speculation the postponement was COVID-related. No confirmation of such. Mars’ dates have been moved to Aug. 27-28.

The answer is 45

To the question “How many pounds has Gov. Steve Sisolak lost during COVID?” That’s the figure he shared Saturday at #VivaVaxVegas vaccination event at Linq Promenade on Saturday. Sisolak appeared alongside Penn & Teller. As the governor said between his weight loss and Penn Jillette’s loss of 100 pounds they have lost Teller.

Return of Romas

It is “Sexxy” time once more at Westgate Cabaret. Jennifer Romas’ adult revue is back as previously reported restarting Aug. 6. The show will run 10 p.m. Fridays Saturdays and Sundays.

Romas and the hotel have partnered since the show opened in January 2015. The new version will feature the only male/female dance act in a ticketed Vegas adult revue. Romas plans to team with her beau Rico Bozant in the new number which has been teased to steamy effect on the couple’s social-media channels. This is also the first erotic male/female stage number in a Strip show since “53X” ran from March-November at Chateau at Paris Las Vegas.

“Sexxy’s” relaunch completes the Westgate Cabaret roster with magician Jen Kramer R&B act “Soul of Motown” incoming family rock ‘n’ roll act Bronx Wanderers and returning star stand-up George Wallace in the again-busy theater.

During COVID Romas also developed an offshoot “Sexxy” show at Larry Flynt’s Hustler Club. That production will continue to run. But Romas considers Westgate her entertainment home understandably as owner David Siegel has shown his loyalty to the production since Romas pitched him the “Sexxy” concept in November 2014.

“Westgate has been our home since the show began in January 2015 and the team is thrilled to be back on our home stage” Romas says. “Our return to this iconic resort is yet another indication that Vegas is back and we couldn’t be more thrilled.”

Oh behave

Amy Saunders has effectively knocked the rust off “Miss Behave Gameshow” over the past two weekends at Majestic Repertory Theatre in the Arts District. Saunders and her flexible tattooed co-star Tiffany sold out all four performances at the Main Street venue.

The show is restricted to those who have proof of vaccination. The new format pits Moderna vs. Pfizer with the two teams splitting the room. Anyone vaccinated with Johnson & Johnson is pushed to the wings. In one game an audience member from either team frantically matches the actors’ names in the “Friends” cast with the characters from the show. This while the theme song plays at an ear-piercing level.

This is much the same vibe as Saunders brought to The Back Room at Bally’s in July 2017 before she turned her attention to a more welcoming location. Saunders is built for the Arts District and also Fremont East where she has worked as entertainment director at Commonwealth for Ryan Doherty and Corner Bar Management.

What’s next? Likely more “Miss Behave” performances through the fall. Saunders and Majestic founder Troy Heard (whose name is a full sentence) have formed an inspired partnership. Look for more ideas this year from these two and more Miss Behavior. As we say the show with no rules rules.

A survey done by The Economist and YouGov of 1500 Americans found that 20% of them think the U.S. government is using the COVID-19 vaccine to microchip the population.

So health departments across the country are fighting back against the idea saying it's simply not true.

""It is a myth that has been spread online unfortunately but there are no microchips no magnets no Bluetooth technology anything like that in the vaccines"" said Jenny Johnson The Public Information Officer for the Utah Department of Health.

Not only is it not true but it's also scientifically impossible to make a microchip small enough to fit through a hypodermic needle and be capable of tracking someone's location.

Masood Tabib-Azar A professor of electrical engineering at the University of Utah said ""Devices and chips that are in that size range are not going to be very sophisticated.""

He also said that while it is possible to make a microchip small enough to fit through a hypodermic needle it wouldn't be able to track someone's GPS location.

Tabib-Azar said making that a reality would require a microchip that's at least 1mm cubed which is far too big to fit through the needle that's used to administer a COVID-19 vaccine and even then the microchip still couldn't be read remotely.

""In order to be able to read it you have to be very close to it. You can not do it with a satellite from miles away"" said Tabib-Azar.

A microchip capable of tracking someone's location would also need to have its own antenna and power source making it even larger.

COVID-19 vaccines are also clear so if they did have microchips in them you'd be able to see them.

Tabib-Azar said ""All vaccines look like water so they don’t have any dust particles or anything floating in them.""

The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has all of the ingredients for each of the COVID-19 vaccines that have emergency use authorization posted on their website.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlbmV2YWRhaW5kZXBlbmRlbnQuY29tL2FydGljbGUvYXJlLXRoZXJlLW1pY3JvY2hpcHMtaW4tdmFjY2luZXMtaXMtZmF1Y2ktc2F0YW7SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Are there microchips in vaccines? Is Fauci Satan?,"I have not heard of this site. Info sounds interesting but: Does it have info on the microchips in the vaccines and a story proving Fauci is Satan? https://t.co/Fz0EOQhHCO — Jon Ralston tweet (@RalstonReports) July 20 2021

It does now.

Yes our poor despondent beleaguered editor-in-chief was being facetious. Contrary to what one opinion columnist for the Washington Post might think mockery and insults are indeed the correct answer when you find yourself arguing with people who would rather trust the ghost of Lyndon LaRouche than live in reality. You can’t reason someone out of something they weren’t reasoned into in the first place so talking someone out of believing the chief medical advisor to the president is Satan is out of the question — where do you even start? You also can’t just let them stew quietly in ignorance and fear — these people are protesting outside of cancer treatment centers and attacking patients for wearing masks.

Do you think the latest Q drop includes an instruction to stop insulting Biden voters and their concerns? Do you think the Proud Boys are telling their members to talk to Bulwark readers and reason them out of being “Never Trump”?

In Nevada Trump voters are storming their own political party then claiming it’s just like January 6th because the police were called not because these people routinely forget the First Amendment grants the right of the people to peaceably assemble. Meanwhile rural county commissions are prohibiting vaccine passports because heaven and government forbid private property owners restrict access to their property against people who refuse to take personal responsibility for their own health. Consequently it now costs less political capital to require everyone to wear a mask once they leave their home regardless of their vaccination status than it does to simply empower those of us who have vaccines to freely live our lives while market forces compel the most of the unvaccinated to take responsibility for their choices.

I’m sure your medical insurance provider knows how much a COVID-19 hospitalization costs. I bet they have actuarial tables comparing hospitalization rates for vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals too. I wonder how quickly people would get vaccinated if they learned their premium would consume their entire paycheck — or in the case of Medicare beneficiaries their Social Security checks — to cover the difference in liability? Or perhaps employers should be able to preferentially hire the vaccinated and lay off the unvaccinated to maximize labor productivity? Avoidable hospitalizations lead to a lot of sick time after all. If employers could do that of course our unemployment system could then require vaccinations to collect unemployment benefits — there’s no reason people should choose to remain wilfully unemployable nor any reason the state should subsidize such foolishness.

But no we’re not going to do any of that. Instead we’re going to force employees to wear masks while they’re on the clock so bureaucrats in Los Angeles Chicago and Hawaii know we’re being super cereal about the pandemic.

So fine let’s talk about microchips in our vaccines and the embodiment of angelic evil that is Dr. Anthony Fauci. Just make sure you wear a mask while you read this column at work.

Are there microchips in vaccines?

No.

For some of us that’s perhaps a shame. In a recent YouGov poll nine percent of vaccinated Americans claimed they believe the U.S. government is using the COVID-19 vaccine to microchip the population which implies they either received the vaccine despite the microchips or perhaps received the vaccine because of them (or alternatively lied — but what kind of person would go on the internet and tell lies?).

Wanting to be microchipped might sound a little crazy but let’s not forget it was only two years ago when I wrote about now-former Assemblyman Skip Daly’s seemingly quixotic quest to ban human microchipping in Nevada. His bill passed but only after it was amended to forbid involuntary microchipping — which means per NRS 200.870 microchipping a Nevadan without their consent via COVID-19 vaccine or anything else has been a class C felony since June 3 2019.

The reason the bill was amended to forbid involuntary microchipping instead of categorically banning microchipping entirely is because a small eccentric minority of Nevadans not only want to be microchipped but already are. This raises an interesting point — it is possible to microchip people. So other than the possibility of feloniously violating state law why aren’t we using vaccines to do it?

To answer that question we need to understand the problem.

To start with microchips are small but they’re not that small — the smallest implantable microchip ever created as of a few months ago was still about the size of a single grain of table salt which means it was still visible to the naked eye. Consequently a vial full of such microchips would appear noticeably cloudy as if it had several specks of dust in it or would appear to have some sort of precipitate in the bottom of the vial.

The good news if you’re a conspiracy theorist is COVID-19 vaccine needles are indeed probably large enough to inject said microchips. According to the CDC vaccines are delivered using 22-25 gauge needles which means each needle has an internal diameter between 0.26-0.413 millimeters. Since the world’s smallest implantable microchip is less than 0.1 millimeters in size an individual microchip would comfortably fit within a COVID-19 vaccine needle though if the concentration of microchips was too great it would only take two or three of them to clump together to clog the vaccine needle.

The bad news if you’re a conspiracy theorist is these particular microchips don’t do much. For starters they require power (they’re too small to carry batteries). Additionally they can’t broadcast anything (they’re too small to carry radios). To work around those limitations researchers designed the chips to communicate and power themselves using ultrasound waves. Consequently if you’re a conspiracy theorist who sincerely believes you’ve been microchipped your best bet is to just avoid obstetricians urologists or any other medical specialists who use ultrasound equipment for diagnostic purposes lest they read the medical information collected by the chips — information which they can much more easily receive merely by putting a thermometer in your ear or a pressure cuff on your arm.

There are microchips which broadcast low power radio frequencies of course as any pet owner can confirm. They’re just not small enough to fit through a COVID-19 vaccine needle. According to PetMD pet microchips are implanted using 12-15 gauge needles which are at least three times wider than any vaccine needle. Additionally pet microchips aren’t delivered in a multi-use vial and sucked out before implantation. Instead each chip is delivered with each needle during manufacture. The reason for this is obvious — if you’re going to shoot a living creature with a 12-15 gauge needle they would greatly appreciate it if you only injected them once rather than accidentally injecting them full of microchip-free solution over and over again.

This brings up a final point — tiny microchips represent the cutting edge of technology and technology’s cutting edges tend to be expensive. When you’re spending enough money to deliver that technology into millions of Americans you want to know what you’re getting. As James Heathers pointed out in The Atlantic small needles filled from multi-use vials injected into muscle tissue is the absolute opposite of what you would want if you wanted to confirm every vaccinated American would receive a fixed number of government-issued microchips. Some might get one or two if any and some would get too many. Besides COVID-19 vaccines are injected into muscle tissue not the surface of the skin — even pet microchips are useless if embedded that deeply.

So no reader who is probably reading this using an internet connected smartphone with GPS-powered location tracking on the government is not injecting your body with microchips using vaccines. There are other cheaper easier ways to get information about you and your movements like ubiquitous municipal video surveillance and facial recognition software. The good news is wearing a mask does indeed confuse facial recognition software. The bad news however is facial recognition software is getting better at identifying faces through masks.

I wonder if anyone’s selling face masks with dazzle camouflage?

Is Dr. Fauci Satan?

This question is not even wrong.

The fundamental difficulty with this question is there is only one provable portion — namely the existence of Dr. Anthony Fauci. I think we have enough clearly repeatable video evidence for us to conclude that yes Dr. Fauci exists or at least exists as much as anyone can be said to exist.

Proving Dr. Fauci is Satan on the other hand would require us to prove Satan’s existence which is I regret to inform you a little beyond the scope of The Nevada Independent and this particular op-ed columnist. As much fun as it might be to read this particular atheist’s summary of Wikipedia’s article on Satan (apparently “satan” is a Hebrew noun meaning “accuser” or “adversary” — I suppose Dr. Fauci is an adversary to some people so Q.E.D.) it’s probably for the best if we leave such theological musings to the actual theologians or at least to someone who attended church or read the Bible in the past twenty years.

In other words I don’t know what God needs with a starship and I don’t know what Satan would need with the chief medical advisor to the president but I’m probably not the person you should be asking anyway. Perhaps I’m Satan. Stranger things have certainly happened.

One thing that isn’t strange however is people calling other people Satan. As Smithsonian Magazine pointed out a few years ago Ben Carson implied Hillary Clinton was in league with Satan and former Speaker of the House John Boehner referred to Republican Senator Ted Cruz as “Lucifer in the flesh” (if we apply the transitive property Ben Carson therefore implied Hillary Clinton was in league with Ted Cruz which makes no sense since Ted Cruz is actually in league with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez) — and that was just in 2016.

Go a few decades further back through our nation’s history and there’s the Satanic Panic which centered around Dungeons & Dragons for whatever reason (Disclaimer: My parents played a lot of D&D when I was young so I was dragged to a lot of their roleplaying sessions — this sounds much more salacious and interesting than it actually was). Rewind even further and you’ll find the Salem Witch Trials which all started with a forced interrogation of a Native American slave.

Yes the Pilgrims had slaves. How do you think they found the time to accuse each other of witchcraft and steal each other’s land in the first place?

Lest you think the Pilgrims pioneered accusing people they don’t like of being in league with Satan I’ll remind you that even before the first non-Viking European settler arrived in North America Dante’s Divine Comedy infamously placed several Florentine officials and Pope Boniface VIII within the various levels of Hell. The Divine Comedy in turn was preceded a few centuries prior by Chaucer’s The Friar’s Tale which describes a cynical argument between two powerful and supposedly holy men.

Point being calling people you don’t like Satan is a tradition which dates back to at least the 13th century if not substantially earlier. Granted it carried more weight when everyone listening to such insults collectively believed in the actual existence of Satan but it’s neither new nor original. It is in fact a depressingly old and common insult.

Is Dr. Fauci Satan? Perhaps perhaps not but one thing is certain — his detractors are breaking very old ground by claiming he might be.

Avishtech joins a growing list of Nexar partner organizations including Arduino Arrow Diotech Keysight Technologies Microchip Samtec and Ultra Librarian.

Nexar software partners are growing their businesses while transforming the electronics design development and manufacturing process from isolated tool chains and disconnected processes into a streamlined next generation workflow that is connected by a comprehensive data model for printed circuit boards. Nexar software partners connect mechanical CAD CAM CAE PLM and other applications that are relevant in the design and realization of electronics to the Altium 365 cloud platform.

Avishtech plays an important role in the Nexar ecosystem. Avishtech’s Gauss Stack and Gauss 2D PCB tool sets provide capability to simulate signal integrity manufacturability and reliability behavior.

Gauss Stack enables thermomechanical simulations that can predict reliability warpage and manufacturability issues like resin starvation and glass stop. Gauss 2D provides first-of-its-kind accurate loss modeling that accounts for ground plane losses and broad extraction of dielectric properties and conductor roughness parameters. Their capabilities are unique in the electronics design industry providing a bridge between simulation and the real world empowering greater accuracy and the Computational Prototyping of PCBs.

As Keshav Amla Avishtech’s Founder and CEO elaborates “We developed our Gauss offerings by looking at the pain points in the industry and working to solve them—on the signal integrity side we honed in on the pain point of inadequate loss modeling in the existing offerings; similarly we saw that PCB reliability and manufacturability were not aspects one could predict but only measure through prototypes or even worse by dealing with field failures so we honed in on these as well.”

Expanding Existing Simulation Capabilities

In May 2021 Avishtech launched its Gauss Synthesis Online Simulation and Design Service. In addition to providing value-add services such as Dimensional Stability simulations and design-to-requirement services this service enables those customers that don’t require a full-on subscription to Avishtech’s Gauss Stack and Gauss 2D PCB toolsets to take advantage of the capabilities provided within them on an as-needed on-demand basis without having to run these simulations themselves. This serves to effectively democratize and simplify the PCB development process and enables Avishtech to support all types and sizes of customers be they designers OEMs or PCB shops.

The Gauss Synthesis innovation makes Avishtech a natural fit for Nexar. “We’re interested in engaging partners who cover the entire spectrum of electronic design needs” explains Ted Pawela Chief Ecosystem Officer at Altium. “Our partnership with Avishtech helps us further transform the electronics design industry by bringing essential simulation tools that designers need to the Altium 365 platform.”

“The design process is a bit fragmented because each step involves different people and software tools. There’s a good amount of data that needs to be exchanged back and forth between product development teams resulting in multiple sets of data that have to be created instead of being able to rely on a single data set for multiple uses. Being able to push/pull data during the design process removes that friction and helps to streamline the design and development process” Amla explains.

As a Nexar partner Avishtech will be able to harness the power of Altium 365 the world’s only cloud platform for printed circuit board design and realization to help automate the data exchange process between Altium Designer and their simulation tools.

“Design processes should be more straightforward. Avishtech looked for what was missing in the ecosystem and built software that models reality better than anything else on the market. Nexar does the same thing for data exchanges; it’s something that should have existed but didn’t. Both Altium and Avishtech are working towards the same goal” Amla concludes.

Since the early days of the pandemic in 2020 when car makers around the world began shuttering factories to try and curb the spread of the virus it began a chain reaction that has led to limited stock in showrooms and now car companies are openly considering cutting back on the amount of technology they offer in cars.

So how did we get here? What does it mean to those looking to buy a car? And what is the solution?

What are semiconductors?

According to Britannica.com a semiconductor is “any of a class of crystalline solids intermediate in electrical conductivity between a conductor and an insulator”.

Broadly speaking you can think of a semiconductor as a microchip a tiny piece of technology that helps so much of the modern world run.

Semiconductors are used in everything from cars and computers to smartphones and even household goods such as televisions.

Why is there a shortage?

It’s a classic case of supply and demand. With the pandemic forcing people around the world to work from home not to mention kids doing classes online the demand for technology items like laptops monitors webcams and microphones ramped up.

However semiconductor manufacturers assumed demand would decline as other industries (including automotive) slowed due to pandemic restrictions.

The majority of semiconductors are produced in Taiwan South Korea and China and those countries have been impacted as badly as anywhere else by COVID-19 and took time to recover.

By the time those plants were fully operational there was a major gulf between the demand for semiconductors and the available supply across so many manufacturers.

The Semiconductor Industry Association reported that demand for its product increased by 6.5 per cent in 2020 amid all the various shutdowns around the world.

The time taken to produce chips - some can take months from start to finish - combined with the long lead times to ramp up production has left manufacturing industries around the world in a difficult position.

What do semiconductors have to do with cars?

The problem for the car industry is complicated. For starters many brands began cutting back on their semiconductor orders early in the pandemic anticipating reduced sales. On the contrary car sales remained strong as people either wanted to avoid public transport or splurge on a new car instead of holidaying.

While all industries have been impacted by this chip shortage the difficulty for the automotive industry is that cars don’t rely on just one type of semiconductor it needs both the latest versions for things like infotainment as well as less-advanced ones for components like power windows.

Despite this car makers are actually relatively small customers compared to the likes of tech giants like Apple and Samsung so they haven’t been given priority resulting in further problems.

The issue wasn’t helped by a fire at one of Japan’s largest chip producers in March this year. The damage caused to the factory stopped production for approximately a month further reducing global supply.

What impact has it had on the car industry?

Every car maker has been impacted by the semiconductor shortage although exactly how badly is hard to determine accurately as the crisis is ongoing. What we do know is that it has affected most brands’ ability to produce cars and will continue to cause supply constraints for some time to come.

Even the biggest manufacturers aren’t immune with Volkswagen Group Ford General Motors Hyundai Motor Group and Stellantis all forced to slow production around the world.

Volkswagen CEO Herbert Diess was quoted saying his group had been unable to build approximately 100000 cars due to a lack of semiconductors.

General Motors was forced to idle factories in the US Canada and Mexico earlier this year and some are still not back online at one stage the American giant predicted this crisis would cost it US$2 billion.

Most brands have opted to focus what semiconductors they can get into the most profitable models; for example GM has prioritised production of its pick-ups and large SUVs over less profitable models and niche products such as the Chevrolet Camaro which has been out of production since May and isn’t due to resume until late August.

Having been troubled by the chip shortage for over a year some brands are now considering more drastic action. Jaguar Land Rover recently admitted that it’s considering cutting certain pieces of equipment from models in order to get the rest of the car built.

That means buyers may have to decide if they want their new car sooner and compromise on specification or be patient and wait for the chip shortage to end so all equipment can be included.

The knock-on effect of this production slowdown is limited supply and delivery delays. In Australia the situation was exacerbated by an already slow first half of 2020 due to the recession and the pandemic only restricted supply more.

While there are signs of recovery in Australia with sales returning to pre-pandemic levels car prices remain higher than average as dealers are limited in the stock they can secure.

When will it end?

That depends on who you listen to with some predicting we’ve been through the worst of the shortage and others warning it could drag on into 2022.

Volkswagen’s head of procurement Murat Aksel told Reuters in June that he predicts the worst period will be over by the end of July.

On the contrary at the time of publication other industry experts are tipping that the supply shortage could actually worsen in the second half of 2021 and create further production delays for car makers.

Stellantis boss Carlos Tavares told reporters this week that he doesn’t expect supply to return to pre-pandemic levels until well into 2022.

What’s the solution to increase supply and stop it happening again?

I know this is an automotive website but the reality is this semiconductor shortage is actually a complex geo-political issue that requires the highest levels of government and business to work together to find a solution.

What the crisis has done is highlight that semiconductor production is centred around Asia -as mentioned earlier the bulk of these chips are produced in Taiwan China and South Korea. That makes life difficult for European and US car makers as it has restricted their ability to secure increased supply in a highly competitive global industry.

As a result world leaders have become involved in this semiconductor issue and pledged to help find a solution.

US president Joe Biden has said his country needs to stop being so reliant on other countries and needs to secure its supply chain for the future. Exactly what that means is difficult to quantify because ramping up manufacturing technical items like semiconductors isn’t the work of a moment.

In February President Biden ordered a 100-day review of global supply chains to try and find a solution to the semiconductor shortage.

In April he met with more than 20 industry executives to discuss his plan to invest US$50 billion into semiconductor production those included GM’s Mary Barry Ford’s Jim Farley and Tavares as well as the likes of Sundar Pichai of Alphabet (Google’s parent company) and representatives from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and Samsung.

The US President is not alone in his concern either. In May German chancellor Angela Merkel told an innovation summit that Europe is putting its key industries in danger if it cannot secure its supply chain.

“If a big bloc like the EU is not in position to create chips I am not comfortable about that” Chancellor Merkel said. ""It is not good if you are a car nation and you can't produce the core component.”

China is reportedly focused on producing as much as 70 per cent of the microchips it needs for its own industries made in the country within the next five years to ensure it has what it needs.

But it’s not just governments making moves several car makers are also being proactive in their efforts to secure. Last month Reuters reported that Hyundai Motor Group had engaged with South Korean chip manufacturers to discuss a long-term solution that would stop this problem happening again.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL2plcnNleWV2ZW5pbmdwb3N0LmNvbS9tb3JlbmV3cy91a25ld3MvMjAyMS8wNy8yNS9taWNyb2NoaXAtbWFrZXItc2FsZS10by1jaGluYS1iaWdnZXItdWstdGhyZWF0LXRoYW4taHVhd2VpLWV4LWN5YmVyLWJvc3Mv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Microchip-maker sale to China bigger UK threat than Huawei – ex-cyber boss,"The sale of a Welsh microchip manufacturer to a Chinese-backed company poses a greater threat to Britain’s interests than Huawei’s involvement in the 5G network according to the UK’s former cyber security chief.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson has asked National Security Adviser Sir Stephen Lovegrove to examine the purchase of Newport Wafer Fab by Chinese-owned Nexperia for a reported £63 million with MPs calling on ministers to urgently intervene.

Ciaran Martin who was chief executive of the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) until August said the future of microchip supply was a “first order strategic issue” for the country.

He told the Telegraph: “Huawei in the periphery of 5G only really mattered because the Trump administration became obsessed with it for reasons they never convincingly set out.

“By contrast the future of semiconductor supply is a first order strategic issue. It goes to the heart of how we should be dealing with China.”

It comes after the influential Commons Foreign Affairs Committee (FAC) said the UK’s “sovereignty should not be for sale” as they called for tougher action to prevent strategically important companies being sold overseas.

Committee chairman Tom Tugendhat said at the time: “Our fiercest competitors notably China have a track record of using foreign investments to gain access to important technologies and information.

“We’ve witnessed too many of our country’s brilliant tech firms disappear abroad with potentially significant economic and foreign policy implications.”"
MU,Micron Technology,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzA3LzI0L2JldHRlci1idXktbnZpZGlhLXZzLW1pY3Jvbi10ZWNobm9sb2d5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Better Buy: Nvidia vs. Micron Technology,"Which of these two high-growth chipmakers deserves your money?

Chipmakers Nvidia (NVDA -1.84%) and Micron Technology (MU -1.27%) have had very different experiences on the stock market so far in 2021 even though both companies have been delivering stellar results quarter after quarter. While Nvidia stock has handily beaten the market Micron shares have remained nearly flat thus far.

Is this a signal that investors should start dumping Micron stock and load up on Nvidia? Well like many market questions this one doesn't have a simple answer. Here's what investors need to know.

The case for Micron Technology

Micron Technology is benefiting from the terrific demand for memory chips. The memory specialist's revenue jumped 36% year over year in the fiscal third quarter (ended June 3 2021) while earnings more than doubled to $1.88 per share from $0.82 per share in the prior-year period.

Micron's fourth-quarter guidance suggests that it isn't going to run out of steam anytime soon. The company's $8.2 billion revenue guidance for this quarter would translate into a 36% year-over-year gain while the $2.30 per share adjusted earnings forecast means that its bottom line is on track to more than double from the prior-year period's $1.08 per share.

However the market hasn't appreciated this terrific growth as the muted stock price performance shows. But that may not be the case forever as Micron is sitting on a bunch of solid catalysts which seem strong enough to help it maintain its high levels of growth in the long run.

Micron's compute and networking business unit (CNBU) which is its largest source of revenue and accounts for 44.5% of its top line witnessed nearly 49% year-over-year revenue growth in Q3. Micron caters to the personal computer (PC) cloud server enterprise graphics and networking markets through this segment. There is great demand for memory chips in all these markets which is leading to tight supplies and higher prices.

Memory market research firm TrendForce estimates that the price of dynamic random access memory (DRAM) could increase between 3% and 8% in the third quarter of the calendar year over Q2. The price increase is a result of strong server and PC DRAM demand and constrained supply.

Similarly the demand for NAND flash has also remained high due to the increased adoption of SSDs (solid-state drives) in both consumer PCs and enterprise hardware. A tight supply means that the price of NAND flash memory is expected to increase between 5% and 10% this quarter which bodes well for Micron's storage business unit (SBU). The segment produced 13% of Micron's top line last quarter and its revenue was flat year over year at $1 billion -- but it could improve given the end-market dynamics.

The mobile business unit meanwhile has hit a purple patch. Its revenue increased 31% year over year in Q3 thanks to the ramp-up in 5G smartphone demand. With 5G smartphones expected to increase at a whopping pace in the next five years Micron's mobile business has room to run higher.

The robust memory demand isn't going to go away anytime soon. According to a third-party forecast memory chip demand is expected to increase 31.7% in 2021 followed by a double-digit increase in 2022 which explains why analysts expect Micron's growth to pick up the pace next fiscal year.

The case for Nvidia

Nvidia's stock market returns in 2021 have been driven by the company's outstanding results. The graphics specialist is growing at a much faster pace than Micron with its fiscal first-quarter revenue jumping 84% year over year to $5.66 billion. Tremendous demand for Nvidia's graphics cards which are used in PCs sent its video gaming revenue soaring. The segment's revenue doubled year over year and accounted for close to half of its top line.

There are two reasons why the video gaming segment is set for terrific growth in the long haul. First Nvidia dominates this market with a market share of 81% according to Jon Peddie Research. It is also worth noting that the chipmaker has substantially increased its presence in the gaming laptop market.

The company's dominant position in the gaming graphics card market brings us to the second reason why this segment is built for growth. Jon Peddie Research estimates that gaming graphics cards could generate $54 billion in revenue by 2025 which would be a big jump over last year's sales of $23.6 billion. Nvidia sold $7.76 billion worth of graphics cards in fiscal 2021 so the additional revenue opportunity on offer and the company's huge market share indicates that this business still has a lot of room for growth.

There's a similar story to Nvidia's data center business which is its second-largest source of revenue. The segment's revenue shot up 79% year over year in Q1 crossing $2 billion in quarterly sales for the first time. With the data center accelerator market expected to clock $53 billion in annual revenue by the end of 2027 according to a third-party estimate the segment's growth streak seems sustainable.

Nvidia is doing well in the market for data center graphics processing units (GPUs) with large cloud service providers preferring to use the company's chips to accelerate workloads. The data center GPU market alone is expected to generate $20 billion in revenue by 2027. Nvidia sold almost $6.7 billion worth of data center GPUs last fiscal year and the massive revenue opportunity points toward more upside in this business.

Throw in the fact that Nvidia is now moving to tap the other fast-growing niches of the data center accelerator market such as server central processing units (CPUs) and data processing units (DPUs) and it becomes easier to see why this segment probably won't run out of steam. Such solid growth drivers make it clear why Nvidia's earnings are expected to jump substantially in the future at an annual pace of nearly 27%.

The verdict

It is evident that both Nvidia and Micron Technology have impressive catalysts that could help them sustain their impressive pace of growth. Value-oriented investors however may lean toward buying Micron stock as it trades at just 20 times trailing earnings compared to Nvidia's multiple of nearly 91.

But then Nvidia is growing at a much faster rate than Micron as we saw above which is why its premium seems justified. Additionally Nvidia dominates its space while Micron faces competition from the likes of SK Hynix and Samsung. Micron reportedly controls 23.5% of the DRAM market which makes it a smaller player than the other two while it stands in fourth position in the NAND market with a share of just 11.2%.

That's why investors with a higher risk tolerance might want to consider buying Nvidia stock to benefit from the tech giant's supremacy in graphics cards as it seems capable of outperforming Micron in the future like it has done so far this year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5sbXRyaWJ1bmUuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL21pY3Jvbi13b3VsZG4tdC1leGlzdC13aXRob3V0LWludmVzdG1lbnQtZnJvbS1zcHVkLWZhcm1lci9hcnRpY2xlXzEyNmY2ZWU0LWFkYzQtNWVlMi04NzhlLTdkYWYzMzgyYTU2MC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Micron wouldn't exist without investment from spud farmer,"State Alabama Alaska Arizona Arkansas California Colorado Connecticut Delaware Florida Georgia Hawaii Idaho Illinois Indiana Iowa Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Maine Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Mississippi Missouri Montana Nebraska Nevada New Hampshire New Jersey New Mexico New York North Carolina North Dakota Ohio Oklahoma Oregon Pennsylvania Rhode Island South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Texas Utah Vermont Virginia Washington Washington D.C.

When Jeff Bezos returned to Earth after a trip to the edge of space there were sighs of relief — and it's likely some of them were from board members of the $1.8 trillion company he started 27 years ago. For Amazon's founder and executive chairman the trip on Tuesday aboard a rocket from his venture Blue Origin may have been the realization of a childhood dream.



But for corporate boards any time a top executive does something dangerous it ends up posing a major risk to the the company's bottom line. Yet as more executives continue to push the envelope boards recognize there isn't much they can do. Take Mark Bertolini the former chairman and CEO of health insurance company Aetna.

A person with a self-described ""adrenaline drive"" Bertolini got his first dirt bike when he was 8 years old and today he owns three Harley-Davidson motorcycles and a Ducati. Bertolini also loves downhill skiing. That was certainly a worry for Aetna's board. ""When I was first named CEO and chairman and was asked to look at a contract they had skiing and motorcycling in there as exclusions"" Bertolini remembers. ""I told them that wouldn't work for me."" Aetna's board had good reason to try to hold Bertolini back. Just a few years before he was named CEO in 2010 Bertolini had been skiing in Vermont. He looked over his shoulder to check something; he hit a tree and dived headfirst into a river. Bertolini spent two hours in the icy water with five broken vertebrae and ended up in coma.

Yet even in the middle of a long difficult recovery Bertolini who was then a top executive told Aetna's board he didn't intend to stop skiing or riding motorcycles. ""I said that 'You know I would continue to be careful and take the appropriate precautions' "" he says. ""But my life was my life and I wasn't willing to give those up."" Zuckerberg grooves to music on his hydrofoil surfboard Bertolini is not alone in his push for thrills. In 2001 when General Motors asked auto executive Robert Lutz to return as its vice chairman the company wanted to limit what he did in his free time.

Like Bertolini Lutz was an avid skier. Lutz also liked to ride motorcycles as well as race cars. He even owned and flew two military jets. Lutz hasn't forgotten what he told the board. ""I'm happy to rejoin the company"" he recalls. ""But I need absolute freedom as far as my hobbies are concerned."" Eventually the board relented and Lutz took the job. (Incidentally he flew those planes until he was 87 when he failed an eye exam.) ""I encountered these restrictions my whole career"" says Lutz who also held senior-level jobs at Ford and Chrysler. But he adds that he ""never took them very seriously and got away with it for 47 years.""

Corporate governance experts say founders of companies especially seem to enjoy a certain kind of impunity. Bezos for example followed in the footsteps of Virgin Group founder Richard Branson who made his own trip to the edge of space just days earlier. And on the Fourth of July Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg posted a video on Instagram of him riding on a hydrofoil surfboard holding an American flag to John Denver's ""Take Me Home Country Roads."" Hillary Sale a professor of law and management at Georgetown University says there should be an open dialogue about an executive's hobbies. ""A good board talks about it thinks about it and prepares for it"" she says.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9pZGFob3N0YXRlc21hbi9uYW1lL2FsbGVuLW5vYmxlLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTIwNjk4MDc00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Allen Noble Obituary (1928 - 2021) - Boise ID - Idaho Statesman,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/idahostatesman/name/allen-noble-obituary?id=20698074 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9pZGFob3N0YXRlc21hbi9uYW1lL2FsbGVuLW5vYmxlLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTIwNjk4MDc00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,

When I think of the history of game consoles I think of flight simulators.

Nintendo in particular has leveraged the ""Pilotwings"" name not once not twice but thrice to show off brand-new tech over various generations. I have long loved that approach. Pilotwings games err on the side of minimal challenge and maximum relaxation arguably to let players calmly absorb the newest 3D-rendering tricks of each era.

I think about that strategy now because Microsoft Flight Simulator is launching on Xbox Series X/S this week. Since it's roughly eight months out from those consoles' launches it doesn't count as a ""launch"" game. But Microsoft Flight Simulator is honestly the first true ""next-gen"" first-party console game in Xbox's latest era. Part of that next-gen quality is because this game unlike other first-party fare has no ""backwards compatibility"" path to the older Xbox One family.

It doesn't take long to realize why. After a tremendous launch on PCs last year MSFS has now emerged as a living room game with an emphasis on relaxed Pilotwings-like trips across the entire globe. In good news it sets a new bar for 3D rendering performance on consoles and it stands head and shoulders above all other console games at this time. But its PC heritage lingers in the form of some clunkiness. Flight-sim novices—particularly those who claim the game as part of their Game Pass subscriptions—should brace themselves for control- and interface-related turbulence.

Getting up to speed—and that's a lot of knots

If you're unfamiliar with MSFS's latest incarnation my report on its reveal nearly two years ago is a good starting point. Much of what I said then (and what I said in a follow-up look at its 2020 beta) is still true. MSFS 2020 combines Bing's world-mapping data Azure's data-processing centers and some fantastic rendering engine technology to open the entire Earth to unfettered flight. That dev team lead by the French studio Asobo employs a lot of clever procedural generation to turn blurry map data into convincing cities forests oceans and valleys for you to fly over.

Since the game's launch on PC Asobo has been vocal and transparent about its efforts to spruce up and fine-tune its plane physics simulations which account for air pressure heat and other weather variables. The results have been generally well received by the flight-sim community and the trade-off for so much beauty and world detail by default is milder physics realism and fewer customization options than rival PC flight sims like X-Plane 11 or Prepar3D. Still this version of MSFS is Microsoft's most competent flyer yet.

One point of community contention however is MSFS's notoriously uneven performance across a variety of PCs. Performance hitches and stutters are more often the rule rather than the exception while massive download requirements for various patches haven't necessarily curried favor with PC players. MS and Asobo have promised PC version optimization as far back as the game's July 2020 beta period yet to this day the PC version pulls powerful CPUs and GPUs to their knees at even ""mid-high"" settings let alone with unnecessarily maxed graphics sliders.

In terms of CPU optimization we're now in ""better late than never"" territory because the Xbox Series X/S ports are clearly running on an updated focused version of the engine. Holy cow are the results tremendous.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpbmRvd3NsYXRlc3QuY29tLzIwMjEvMDcvMjQvbWljcm9zb2Z0LWV4cGxhaW5zLXdpbmRvd3MtMTFzLW5ldy1zdGFydC1tZW51LWFuZC10YXNrYmFyLWRlc2lnbi_SAW5odHRwczovL3d3dy53aW5kb3dzbGF0ZXN0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzA3LzI0L21pY3Jvc29mdC1leHBsYWlucy13aW5kb3dzLTExcy1uZXctc3RhcnQtbWVudS1hbmQtdGFza2Jhci1kZXNpZ24vYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Microsoft explains Windows 11’s new Start Menu and taskbar design,"The next major version of Windows introduces a major overhaul of the UI. With Windows 11 Microsoft is ditching live tiles that first debuted with Windows 8 in 2012 and introducing a new interface for Windows 10’s Action Center (notification center) taskbar flyouts and more.

Windows 11’s redesign has been in the works for a while and it comes with major changes to the taskbar and Start Menu. The new Start menu has dropped live tiles for Windows 10X-like app icons and taskbar icons are centered by default. Start Windows Search Action Center and other flyouts now float above the taskbar.

However a new design doesn’t necessarily mean that it will work well for everyone. In a series of videos and interviews Microsoft talked about a variety of aspects of the new design language and how it came to be. With Windows 11 Microsoft said it wanted to design an interface that tablet desktop and large monitor users could take advantage of.

Windows 11’s centered Start and taskbar experience is the result of years of research and testing by a team of about 40 designers.

Should Start be left-aligned or center aligned? Should there be a search box? Should there be an all-apps list to start going to feel familiar? Microsoft’s research team argued over different design ideas when finalizing the search bar weather documents and apps layout for the Start menu.

“It was really cool to see what all these different people were building. Like what order did they put them in? You know some people thought the weather was important but other people wavered on that. They were all a little bit different but one thing that they had in common: We always saw search files and applications together” Microsoft’s designers explained in a video.

The centered taskbar icons and Start button

Regarding the default alignment of the taskbar Microsoft says it wanted to make sure that the “Start button felt efficient”. When working on centered taskbar and Start Microsoft considered various form factors including handheld tablets to full-fledged desktops and ultra-wide monitors.

Microsoft decided to put the Start and taskbar icons in the center to address a design problem where the user actually need to travel in order to interact with the Start button on large monitors or tablets.

If you prefer the traditional taskbar experience Microsoft has made it easy to relocate the Start button back to the lower-left corner.

Problem with Windows 11’s redesigned taskbar

As we recently reported Windows 11 could also bring some unwelcome changes to the taskbar.

For example Windows 11 will not allow you to drag and drop apps onto the taskbar and Microsoft has also turned off a feature that lets you drag a file onto an app on the taskbar to open the file in the app.

There’s still plenty of time for Microsoft to restore the taskbar features ahead of its October 2021 release but there’s no guarantee or official confirmation from the company.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vbWljcm9zb2Z0LWVkZ2Utb3Blbi1wcmV2aW91cy10YWJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to Always Open Microsoft Edge With Previous Tabs,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vbWljcm9zb2Z0LWVkZ2Utb3Blbi1wcmV2aW91cy10YWJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsZWVwaW5nY29tcHV0ZXIuY29tL25ld3Mvc2VjdXJpdHkvbWljcm9zb2Z0LXNoYXJlcy1taXRpZ2F0aW9ucy1mb3ItbmV3LXBldGl0cG90YW0tbnRsbS1yZWxheS1hdHRhY2sv0gF1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxlZXBpbmdjb21wdXRlci5jb20vbmV3cy9zZWN1cml0eS9taWNyb3NvZnQtc2hhcmVzLW1pdGlnYXRpb25zLWZvci1uZXctcGV0aXRwb3RhbS1udGxtLXJlbGF5LWF0dGFjay9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Microsoft shares mitigations for new PetitPotam NTLM relay attack,"Microsoft has released mitigations for the new PetitPotam NTLM relay attack that allows taking over a domain controller or other Windows servers.

PetitPotam is a new method that can be used to conduct an NTLM relay attack discovered by French security researcher Gilles Lionel (Topotam). This method was disclosed this week along with a proof-of-concept (PoC) script.

The new attack uses the Microsoft Encrypting File System Remote Protocol (EFSRPC) to force a device including domain controllers to authenticate to a remote NTLM relay controlled by a threat actor.

Once a device authenticates to a malicious NTLM server a threat actor can steal hash and certificates that can be used to assume the identity of the device and its privileges.

Mitigation limited to Domain Controllers

After news of the PetitPotam NTLM relay attack broke yesterday Microsoft published a security advisory with recommendations for organizations to defend against threat actors using the new technique on domain controllers.

The company says that organizations exposed to PetitPotam or other relay attacks have NTLM authentication enabled on the domain and are using Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) with Certificate Authority Web Enrollment or Certificate Enrollment Web Service.

In a tweet earlier today Microsoft recommends disabling NTLM where it is not necessary e.g. Domain Controllers or to enable the Extended Protection for Authentication mechanism to protect credentials on Windows machines.

The company also recommends on networks with NTLM enabled that services allowing NTLM authentication to use signing features such as SMB signing that’s been available since Windows 98.

“PetitPotam takes advantage of servers where Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) is not configured with protections for NTLM Relay Attacks [as outlined in KB5005413]” - Microsoft

However PetitPotam is about abusing the EfsRpcOpenFileRaw function of the MS-EFSRPC API to pass on authentication requests leaving the door open for other attacks.

Microsoft's advisory is clear about the action to prevent NTLM relay attacks but does not address the abuse of the MS-EFSRPC API which would need a security update to fix.

Gilles Lionel told BleepingComputer that PetitPotam allows other atacks such as a downgrading attack to NTLMv1 that uses the Data Encryption Standard (DES) - an insecure algorithm due to its short 56-bit key generation that makes it easy to recover a password hash.

One example Gilles Lionel told BleepingComputer is a downgrading attack to NTLMv1 that uses the Data Encryption Standard (DES) - an insecure algorithm due to its short 56-bit key generation that makes it easy to recover a password hash.

An attacker can then use the account on machines where it has local admin privileges. Lionel says that Exchange and Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM) servers are a common scenario.

Benjamin Delpy expressed criticism at the way Microsoft decided to mitigate PetitPotam highlighting that the EFSRPC protocol is not even mentioned in the advisory.

PetitPotam affects Windows Server 2008 through 2019. Microsoft’s advisory notes that the technique has not been exploited in the wild yet but has no assessment about the exploitability level.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vdG9tdGFsa3MuYmxvZy9wcmV2aWV3LW1pY3Jvc29mdC10ZWFtcy0yLTAtb24td2luZG93cy0xMS1yb2xscy1vdXQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Preview Microsoft Teams 2.0 on Windows 11 rolls out,"A few weeks ago I blogged about the new “Teams 2.0” client which is initially coming for Teams personal (consumer) bundled in with Windows 11.

It’s Chat only right now audio and video calling are yet to come in a later build “over the coming weeks”

This is interesting as it’s essentially a preview of what we might expect in a future enterprise version of Microsoft Teams.

What’s in the preview:

New Chat flyout right off the taskbar

WIN + C anywhere in Windows 11 to launch the chat flyout

Notifications with inline replies

Add contacts via an email address or phone number – If they don’t already have a teams consumer account they will be sent an email or SMS

SMS Support allows mobile/cell users to actually join and interact with chat on SMS (US Canada Mexico Brazil Colombia India and Great Britain only) see details here:

Sync previous Skype consumer or Outlook.com personal contacts into Teams (check box option you can choose to do or not)

Teams client supports both light and dark Windows System modes/themes.

Preview limitations

Experience is localized for English (US) only. Additional languages and locales will come later.

Interestingly the URL to download the client was leaked and it does install fine on Windows 10 too but you don’t get the chat flyout or new Windows wide shortcuts. I expect this new Teams Personal client won’t be a Windows 11 exclusive but Windows 11 will enable some exclusive abilities tightly tied into the OS."

Here’s who could need one when they are.,"The Biden administration now believes that fully vaccinated people who are older or immunocompromised may need a booster shot.

Though all three vaccines authorized for use in the United States — Pfizer/BioNTech Moderna and Johnson & Johnson — are highly effective in preventing Covid-19 infections recent data suggests that the efficacy of Pfizer’s two-dose vaccine can wane slightly four to six months after vaccination according to the New York Times.

However a booster shot could lift antibody levels even more substantially than the current two-dose regimen for the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines and could be especially beneficial for people 65 and older and those who are immunocompromised.

People who are immunocompromised may receive significantly less immune protection than the general population after two vaccine doses increasing the upside of a potential third shot.

According to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advisory committee which met earlier this week to discuss the potential need for booster shots about 2.7 percent of the US population is currently immunocompromised in some way whether due to ongoing medical treatment like chemotherapy their status as organ transplant recipients or another reason.

Immunocompromised people are also more likely to become severely ill from Covid-19 and they have a markedly higher chance of experiencing breakthrough infections despite being vaccinated — a concern magnified by a delta variant-fueled resurgence of Covid-19 cases in the US.

10. I am not clear if #ACIP & @CDCgov are legally able to recommend additional doses of #Covid vaccines while @US_FDA's EUAs stipulate the mRNA vaccines are 2-dose vaxes & J&J's is 1 dose. But CDC is making clear it isn't going to move on this till FDA alters the vaxes' status. pic.twitter.com/DMMIU0uKfZ — Helen Branswell (@HelenBranswell) July 22 2021

As things stand data from Pfizer indicates that its vaccine — the first to be authorized in the US and still the most common among US vaccine recipients — declines from 95 percent to 84 percent effectiveness against symptomatic infection after four to six months according to the Times’ Sharon LaFraniere.

Data from Israel where Covid cases are once again rising suggest that an even sharper decline in effectiveness against symptomatic infections is possible — but even then the vaccine remains “more than 90 percent effective in preventing severe disease” and the small sample size means there is still uncertainty about Israel’s findings.

“The goal of this vaccine is not to prevent mild or low moderate infectious disease” Dr. Paul Offit a member of the Food and Drug Administration’s outside advisory committee told the Times. “The goal is to prevent hospitalization to death. Right now this vaccine has held up to that.”

A booster shot administered at the six-month mark could increase antibody levels as much as tenfold according to data released earlier this year by both Pfizer and Moderna underscoring its potential value to older and immunocompromised people.

Israel is already offering a third Pfizer shot for immunocompromised residents — though millions of Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip have yet to be vaccinated — and Pfizer has previously suggested that a booster shot could be needed in the US.

Regulatory questions abound

Though the US currently has tens of millions of surplus Covid-19 vaccine doses on hand making a third Pfizer or Moderna shot available to millions of immunocompromised or elderly Americans likely won’t be a quick process.

Currently all three Covid-19 vaccines in use in the US are being administered under an emergency use authorization or EUA issued by the FDA which sets specific regimens for each vaccine: two doses several weeks apart for both Pfizer and Moderna and a single dose for Johnson & Johnson.

Changing that according to the Washington Post would require either full FDA approval for the vaccine or an amendment to the EUA. And until that happens the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices can’t go forward with recommending a third shot for vulnerable populations in the US.

According to the New York Times “doctors would have vastly more leeway to prescribe a booster for their patients” once the vaccine is fully approved by the FDA.

However there are some potential workarounds to get third shots in arms more quickly. According to Dr. Amanda Cohn chief medical officer for the CDC’s immunization and respiratory diseases center the US is “actively looking into ways ... to potentially provide access earlier than any potential change in regulatory decisions” — including through “a study or through an investigational new drug format.”

As the Washington Post reported after the advisory board meeting earlier this week that strategy could open up access to a third shot under the FDA’s compassionate use program which “would require enrolling individuals in a clinical study where additional doses can be given.”

President Joe Biden also struck an encouraging tone on the prospects for the FDA’s full vaccine approval in coming months at a recent town hall in Cincinnati Ohio.

“They’re [the FDA] not promising me any specific date but my expectation talking to the group of scientists we put together... plus others in the field is that sometime maybe in the beginning of the school year at the end of August beginning September October they’ll get a final approval” Biden told CNN’s Don Lemon on Wednesday.

Full FDA approval requires a massive amount of data including at least six months of vaccine efficacy data and it usually takes about 10 months for the agency to review license applications and reach a decision.

“When we were reviewing applications back when they were on paper there was so much it would not fit on the freight elevator” Norman Baylor the former head of the FDA’s Office of Vaccines Research and Review told CNN. “That’s how big the application is.”

However the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine has already been granted a priority review which shortens the potential timeline to six months and multiple officials have said approval will likely come even sooner potentially clearing the way for booster shots for older and immunocompromised people.

Moderna is currently “in the process of completing our rolling submission” to the FDA according to a Moderna spokesperson and approval for the Moderna vaccine will almost certainly take longer. The company told CNN this week that it has no specific timeline in place yet.

Full FDA approval could also have a number of other benefits in addition to opening up the possibility of booster shots for vulnerable groups. As NBC’s Shannon Pettypiece explained on Tuesday “the official regulatory signoff would remove a significant legal and public relations barrier for businesses and government agencies that want to require vaccinations for their employees and customers” and could also boost vaccine confidence.

Thus far the US has largely held back from imposing vaccine mandates though other countries such as France have embraced them to positive effect.

The delta variant is spreading fast

As the Biden administration consensus coalesces behind the need for a booster shot for vulnerable groups the delta variant of Covid-19 is gaining ground quickly in the US fueling a sharp rise in new cases.

On Saturday the US reported a rolling seven-day average of nearly 50000 cases per day — the highest level since early May according to CNN’s Ryan Struyk and almost 39000 more cases than the same seven-day average in late June.

The United States is now reporting 49386 new coronavirus cases per day the highest seven-day average since May 3 according to data from @CNN and Johns Hopkins University. — Ryan Struyk (@ryanstruyk) July 24 2021

Additionally at a Thursday White House briefing on the pandemic CDC director Dr. Rochelle Walensky warned that the delta variant “now represents more than 83 percent of the virus circulating in the United States.”

CDC director Rochelle Walensky said that the infectious Delta variant of COVID-19 which was first found in India now comprises more than 83% of new cases nationwide https://t.co/77YcbvhKMG pic.twitter.com/dXK699zl6J — Reuters (@Reuters) July 22 2021

“Compared to the virus we had circulating initially in the United States at the start of the pandemic the delta variant is more aggressive and much more transmissible than previously circulating strains” Walensky said. “It is one of the most infectious respiratory viruses we know of and that I have seen in my 20-year career.”

As Vox’s Umair Irfan explained in late June when delta accounted for just 20 percent of new Covid cases in the US the CDC has identified delta as one of five “variants of concern.” Not only does it spread far faster than the original strain of Covid but it’s better at evading vaccine protections and as Irfan reports there’s some evidence that it can cause “more severe outcomes from Covid-19 compared to the original versions of the virus.”

Despite those breakthrough cases however the delta surge is overwhelmingly proving to be “a pandemic of the unvaccinated” as Walensky put it earlier this month. In the US more than 99 percent of recent deaths and about 97 percent of recent hospitalizations from Covid-19 have been among unvaccinated individuals.

As a result this latest virus outbreak has been especially bad in parts of the US with low vaccine uptake such as rural Missouri.

As The Atlantic’s Ed Yong reported from Missouri earlier this month “ICUs are also filling with younger patients in their 20s 30s and 40s including many with no underlying health problems.”

According to Yong

Almost every COVID-19 patient in Springfield’s hospitals is unvaccinated and the dozen or so exceptions are all either elderly or immunocompromised people. The vaccines are working as intended but the number of people who have refused to get their shots is crushing morale. Vaccines were meant to be the end of the pandemic. If people don’t get them the actual end will look more like Springfield’s present: a succession of COVID-19 waves that will break unevenly across the country until everyone has either been vaccinated or infected.

A swath of southern states including Louisiana and Florida are currently reporting more cases per 100000 people than anywhere else in the US with Florida alone contributing more than one-fifth of all new cases in the US.

“Folks [are] supposed to have common sense” Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey a Republican said this week. “But it’s time to start blaming the unvaccinated folks not the regular folks. It’s the unvaccinated folks that are letting us down.”

Currently only 34 percent of Alabamans are fully vaccinated — the worst vaccination rate of the any state in the US along with Mississippi.

Getting vaccinated protects individuals — and the whole community

As of Saturday about 57 percent of the vaccine-eligible population in the US — more than 162 million people — have been fully vaccinated according to data from the CDC. Another 15 million or so more have received at least one dose of the vaccine.

That level of widespread vaccination is unequivocally good news but with US Covid cases on the rise and the delta variant running rampant it invariably also means some of the new Covid cases in the US are “breakthrough infections” — fully vaccinated people nonetheless testing positive for Covid-19.

As Vox’s Umair Irfan explains

The CDC definition of a breakthrough infection is a laboratory-confirmed infection more than 14 days after the final dose of a Covid-19 vaccine as it can take a while for the full protection of a vaccine to spool up. This definition includes everything from infections that produce no symptoms at all to cases that result in death. “People often think about ‘infection’ and ‘disease’ as being the same thing and that is not the case” said Brianne Barker a virologist at Drew University. It’s only when a virus starts causing symptoms that an infected person is said to have disease so not all SARS-CoV-2 infections cause Covid-19. But as we’ve seen throughout the pandemic people can carry and transmit the virus without falling ill themselves creating a major route for the spread of Covid-19. That’s why tracking breakthrough cases is so important.

The good news about breakthrough infections though is that if you’re vaccinated and get sick with Covid-19 you’re far less likely to get severely ill than you would without a vaccine. With a vaccine the chance of hospitalization and death are both reduced compared to unvaccinated individuals according to Dr. Anthony Fauci the United States’ top infectious disease expert.

“If you look at the number of deaths about 99.2 percent of them are unvaccinated. About 0.8 percent are vaccinated” Fauci told NBC’s Chuck Todd on Meet the Press earlier this month. “No vaccine is perfect. But when you talk about the avoidability of hospitalization and death ... it’s really sad and tragic that most all of these are avoidable and preventable.”

Breakthrough infections shouldn't be taken to mean vaccines don’t work; but they SHOULD be taken as even more reason to get that shot in your arm. If everyone was vaccinated there would be far less reason for the virus to spread & fewer people for it to spread btwn. #velshi — Ali Velshi (@AliVelshi) July 24 2021

Currently the country is administering about 537000 doses per day on average down from more than a million per day on average at the start of July — and that dropoff could fuel a brutal self-reinforcing cycle.

Specifically according to Irfan “with vaccination rates slowing reports of people becoming infected after their immunizations could feed vaccine hesitancy which in turn can fuel more breakthrough cases.”

In reality however getting vaccinated actually heads off the risk of further breakthrough infections by making it harder for the virus to spread. And by the same token getting more people vaccinated will also go a long way toward protecting older and immunocompromised people who have already been vaccinated but may now need a booster shot.

“Each day hundreds of thousands of Americans are choosing to protect themselves their kids and their neighbors by getting their first shot” White House Covid czar Jeff Zients said this week. “These Americans are stepping up and doing their part.

The different coronavirus vaccines have one thing in common: They've been met with skepticism by some Americans who have often shared misinformation about their potential side effects.

Many of these false claims center around pregnant women.

""The CDC have been caught manipulating data to justify giving pregnant women the COVID jab"" an image posted July 10 on Instagram says. ""Their study stated just 12% of women suffered a miscarriage after having the jab the actual figure was 82%.""

The image is a screenshot of a July 6 tweet by the Daily Expose a London-based alternative news site that has previously shared misinformation regarding vaccine safety. The tweet was retweeted nearly 2000 times in the first week and the Instagram post has received over 1200 likes since it was posted on July 10.

The post refers to an April 21 study from researchers at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and published by the New England Journal of Medicine.

A similar Instagram post claimed women who got vaccinated within 30 days to 20 weeks of becoming pregnant had an 82% miscarriage rate. The image received more than 6400 likes before it was deleted.

The study researched the safety of COVID-19 vaccines based on messenger RNA or mRNA in pregnant women between Dec. 14 2020 and Feb. 28.

The Instagram user told USA TODAY he shared the image because several women had messaged him ""expressing concerns over changes in their menstrual cycle.""

False claims about the vaccine harming pregnant women aren't new.

USA TODAY has previously debunked other false claims about the vaccine causing infertility in women miscarriages increasing since the vaccine rollout and vaccines causing menstrual cycle changes.

This claim is also wrong.

The study data released so far actually showed only 12.6 % of pregnant women in the study had a miscarriage – not 82%. The study concluded that vaccinations weren't a safety risk for pregnant women.

Fact check:Claim about unvaccinated being sent to quarantine camps started as satire

The Daily Expose along with social media users who've shared the claim reached the errant conclusion by altering the data that scientists used experts say.

Study found no safety concerns in pregnancy caused by vaccines

The study used data from three main data-collecting programs within the CDC: the V-safe Pregnancy Registry the V-safe smartphone tool and the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System or VAERS.

A total of almost 4000 women from the pregnancy registry participated in the study. Of that group 827 participants completed their pregnancy by the end of the study a category that included healthy births miscarriages and any other complications that ended the pregnancy.

Among those 827 completed pregnancies 712 gave birth and 104 had a miscarriage. One case resulted in a stillbirth and 10 resulted in either induced abortion or extrauterine pregnancy.

Those completed pregnancies consisted primarily of women at the very beginning or very end of their terms. The live birth group was of course at the end and the miscarraiges generally occurred among those early on.

Out of the 104 miscarriages 94 occurred within the first 13 weeks of the pregnancy – the first trimester which is when most miscarriages happen according to the Mayo Clinic.

That works out to a miscarriage rate of 12.6%. According to Mayo Clinic that percentage is within the average miscarriage rate for the population at large which is between 10% and 20%.

The researchers made it clear that the data is preliminary and that ""continued monitoring is needed to further assess"" possible effects in pregnancies associated with the vaccines.

""The findings may change as additional pregnancy outcomes are reported and the sample size increases which may facilitate detection of rare outcomes"" the study said.

Fact check:False claim that COVID-19 vaccine isn't effective because you're not charged for it

Martha Sharan a spokesperson for the CDC Vaccine Task Force said experts are currently analyzing the most recent data from over 1000 other participants who were vaccinated in their first trimester. A report is forthcoming.

Daily Expose article skewed data

The Daily Expose article linked on the image shared on Instagram claims women who were vaccinated within the first 20 weeks of their pregnancy had an 82% rate of miscarriage.

The publication altered the data used to calculate the miscarriage rate in order to get that percentage. Researchers divided 104 – the number of miscarriages recorded – by 827 – the total number of completed pregnancies at the time of analysis.

But the article argued because the 700 women who had live births were vaccinated in their third trimester when miscarriages are less common they shouldn't be used as part of the sample to analyze the miscarriage rate.

So the Daily Expose changed the denominator and divided 104 by 127 which it claims is the number of women who were pregnant and were vaccinated in their first or second trimester. That results in the claimed 82% miscarriage rate.

But that change doesn't portray the data accurately according to Sharan.

""This is not an appropriate calculation based on the data available because more than 1000 pregnancies (from those vaccinated in the first and second trimester) were ongoing and their outcome data wasn't available at the time of the report"" she said.

Fact check:Mayim Bialik actress and neuroscientist has been vaccinated contrary to claim

Other experts agree.

Victoria Male a reproductive immunology lecturer at Imperial College called the new percentage ""a meaningless statistic"" in a Twitter thread.

Male explained why the reasoning is flawed: Using that new denominator only takes into consideration completed pregnancies in the first and second trimester in which a miscarriage is the only result possible.

""Presumably the only reason that rate isn't 100% is because some people vaccinated at the end of the 2nd trimester completed their pregnancies within three months by giving birth"" she tweeted.

Our rating: False

We rate the claim that a study found vaccinated pregnant women had an 82% rate of miscarriage FALSE based on our research. The claim is based on a mischaracterization of the data available experts say. The process used to come up with the 82% figure ignores any women who were vaccinated in the first and second trimester and didn't miscarry data thathas not yet been released.

On June 29 the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) granted a restricted emergency use approval to Moderna making it the fourth Covid-19 vaccine to get such approval in India after Covishield Covaxin and Sputnik V.

On July 2 the central government said it is expecting doses of Moderna vaccine to reach India in the next few days.

Eighteen days later Regional Director of the World Health Organisation (WHO) (South-East Asia) Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh said India has been offered 7.5 million (75 lakh) doses of Moderna vaccine through WHO's Covid-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) programme.

However there is no clarity on when Moderna jabs would be available in India. As per the WHO the vaccine's availability is ""subject to clearance of indemnity clause"" by the Indian government.

This donation of 7.5 million doses of Moderna vaccine from COVAX is separate from those that require a purchase agreement with the vaccine makers.

As far as purchasing American vaccines is concerned Moderna in May stated that it is overbooked with international orders and will not be available to supply commercially before 2022.

LEGAL INDEMNITY: KABHI HAAN KABHI NA

Foreign vaccine manufacturers like Moderna and Pfizer have been seeking legal protection from the Indian government against any adverse claims that are linked to the use of their Covid-19 vaccines. Rolling out of these vaccines is conditional upon the government providing the manufacturers this legal protection.

This indemnity clause to the vaccine rollout has been a major bone of contention between the Indian government and the vaccine makers and has delayed the vaccines from reaching India.

After initially hinting that India would be open to giving indemnity to foreign vaccine makers such as Moderna and Pfizer the government now seems to be apprehensive about such a commitment.

""We are discussing (indemnity clause) but at this moment we are focusing on the language of the contract for the indemnity clause. Discussion is happening clause by clause with the vaccine manufacturers"" a government source privy to the discussions had told India Today TV on July 13.

Sources in the Union Health Ministry have said Pfizer has already indicated that it would be able to make available some doses by July 2021. ""The government would look at rules and practices that have been followed in other countries on granting indemnity coverage"" one of the sources said.

Speaking on availability of foreign Covid-19 vaccines Niti Aayog member Dr VK Paul recently said the government is ""working actively"" with Moderna to see how its Covid-19 vaccine can be imported and be made available in India.

While rollout of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines is stuck over indemnity clause the vaccines have already reached India's neighbours like Pakistan Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.

All these countries have received millions of doses of the American vaccines over the past few weeks.

On July 3 Pakistan received 2.5 million (25 lakh) doses of Moderna vaccine from the US and more are expected to be delivered in the coming days. The doses will be administered to Pakistani citizens aged more than 18 years.

Bangladesh also received 2.5 million (25 lakh) doses of Moderna vaccine on July 3 via COVAX the WHO-backed initiative for equitable distribution of Covid-19 vaccines.

Meanwhile Sri Lanka was the first South Asian nation to receive Pfizer vaccine doses from the US.

ROADMAP TO MODERNA's ROLLOUT UNCLEAR

In early July the government said it was expecting Moderna vaccine to reach India before July 15. Since the vaccine is an mRNA vaccine and needs to be stored in colder temperatures of below -70 to -80 degrees Celsius it was being discussed to make it available in a few major government hospitals by the middle of this month.

The distribution would then take another week. The vaccine was to be provided free of cost to the beneficiaries as they are part of COVAX Alliance and a donation from the US government.

It added ""No doses of Moderna and Pfizer vaccines have so far been received under US donation programme. NEGVAC (National Empowered Group on Vaccine Administration against Covid-19) is deliberating with offshore Covid-19 vaccine manufacturers including Moderna and Pfizer for procurement of these vaccines.""

In another response the government said ""The exact number of doses to be imported and their manner of allocation has not been finalised yet.""

The European Medicines Agency on Friday recommended authorizing Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine for children ages 12 to 17 the first time the shot has been authorized for people under 18.

The EU drug regulator said research in more than 3700 children aged 12 to 17 showed that the Moderna vaccine — already given the OK for adults across Europe — produced a comparable antibody response.

Until now the vaccine made by Pfizer and German partner BioNTech has been the only option for children as young as 12 in North America and Europe.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is currently considering whether to extend the use of the Moderna vaccine to the same age group.

With global vaccine supplies still tight much of the world is struggling to immunize adults. The World Health Organization and other agencies have urged rich countries to donate their doses to the developing world — where fewer than 2% of people have been vaccinated — rather than moving on to inoculate their less vulnerable populations.

Hundreds of millions of Moderna doses already have been administered to adults and the company says the two-dose vaccine is just as protective for adolescents. In a study of more than 3700 12- to 17-year-olds the vaccine triggered the same signs of immune protection and no COVID-19 diagnoses arose in the vaccinated group compared with four cases among those given dummy shots.

Sore arms headache and fatigue were the most common side effects in the young vaccine recipients the same ones as for adults.

U.S. and European regulators caution however that both the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines appear linked to an extremely rare reaction in teens and young adults — chest pain and heart inflammation.

In the United States children represent about 14% of the nation’s total coronavirus cases to date. And while the young are far less likely than the old to get seriously ill at least 344 children have died of COVID-19 in the U.S. alone according to a tally by the American Academy of Pediatrics.

So far in the U.S. just under half the population is fully vaccinated — with the highest rates not surprisingly among older adults. Just a quarter of 12- to 15-year-olds who got access to Pfizer’s vaccine starting in May have had their second dose according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Among those 16 and 17 about 37% are fully vaccinated.

Both Pfizer and Moderna have begun testing in even younger children from age 11 down to 6 months old. These studies are more complex: Teens receive the same dose as adults but researchers are testing smaller doses in younger children. The first results from children of elementary school age are expected in September.

The EU drug regulator said it would continue to monitor the safety and efficacy of the Moderna vaccine in children as it is used in European member countries.

Although some countries have authorized Pfizer-BioNTech's vaccine for children under 18 not all have decided to start using it citing the minimal risks children face from the coronavirus.

In Britain for example regulator cleared Pfizer's vaccine for 12 to 15-year-olds but health officials have so far declined to recommend the vaccine for anyone under 18 unless they have medical conditions that warrant it.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vZW4udmlldG5hbXBsdXMudm4vdmlldG5hbS1yZWNlaXZlcy1leHRyYS0zLW1sbi1jb3ZpZC0xOS12YWNjaW5lLWRvc2VzLWZyb20tdXMtdmlhLWNvdmF4LXBvc3QyMDUyMjkudm5w0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Vietnam receives extra 3 mln COVID-19 vaccine doses from US via COVAX,"Vietnam receives additional 3000060 doses of COVID-19 Moderna vaccine donated through the COVAX Facility by the United States Government.

Hanoi (VNA) – Vietnam receives additional 3000060 doses of COVID-19 Moderna vaccine donated through the COVAX Facility by the United States Government of which 1499960 arrived in Ho Chi Minh City on July 24 and 1500100 doses will arrive in Hanoi the next day.



This is the second batch of Moderna vaccine to be delivered to the country this month bringing the total donation from the US Government to Vietnam to more than five million doses according to UNICEF Vietnam.



To date Vietnam has received 7493300 doses of COVID-19 vaccines in four shipments through the COVAX Facility the global risk-sharing mechanism for pooled procurement and equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. They include 5000100 doses of Moderna vaccine from the US Government and 2493200 doses of AstraZeneca.



Since the arrival of the first shipment of vaccines from the COVAX Facility in early April close to 4.5 million COVID-19 vaccine doses have been administered in Vietnam among them 353601 second doses. The additional vaccines will help the Ministry of Health to expand coverage and reach more people from priority groups contributing to attaining the country’s target of vaccinating more than 70 percent of population by the end of the first quarter of 2022.



“These vaccines arrive at a critical time for Vietnam as the country experiences its fourth and most devastating wave of COVID-19” said UNICEF Vietnam Acting Representative Lesley Miller. “The doses donated by the US Government through COVAX will boost Vietnam’s vaccination campaign to protect health staff frontline workers the elderly and other priority groups defined by the Government.”



The COVAX Facility is co-led by the World Health Organization (WHO) Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness and Innovations (CEPI) GAVI the Vaccine Alliance and UNICEF as the key delivery partner. The donated vaccines are provided through the COVAX dose-sharing mechanism which allows well-supplied countries to share vaccine doses with other countries to help protect the most at-risk populations globally. The vaccines will contribute to the aim of reaching 20 percent coverage in low- and middle-income countries as part of the Phase 1 vaccine allocation.



For several months COVAX partners WHO CEPI GAVI and delivery partner UNICEF have been supporting the Government of Vietnam in readiness efforts and the national rollout of COVID-19 vaccines. They have been especially active in developing a National Vaccination Plan as Vietnam is benefiting from the Advance Market Commitment (AMC) an innovative financial mechanism to help secure global and equitable access for COVID-19 vaccines./."

The implications of higher inflation and COVID-19 infection rates for the food industry

A recent Food Institute study found that among G20 economies countries with higher COVID-19 infection rates are experiencing higher inflation. With that what are the implications for the food industry? Let’s take a closer look.

Higher inflation and COVID-19 infection rates

The Federal Reserve acknowledged that inflation has increased “notably” and COVID-19 still poses risks to the recovery. At the center of the current inflation debate is the question of when will the pandemic be contained to the degree that the economy can return to “normalcy.” Waves of the pandemic especially the surging Delta variant created uncertainties for the economy. And these uncertainties exacerbated the mismatch between supply and demand which in turn sparked inflation growth.

In The Food Institute study we found that among G20 economies countries that have been more affected by the pandemic are experiencing higher rates of inflation. In the initial study we divided the countries into two groups by the number of COVID-19 cases as well as the infection rate (number of COVID-19 cases / number of tests). Then computed the average inflation rate for each group based on each country’s latest CPI or similar measure. In further analysis we excluded outliers (countries that had extremely high or low inflation prior to the pandemic). In other words their high/low rate of inflation is not necessarily a result of the pandemic.

After excluding outliers the first group (high COVID-19 cases) had an average inflation rate of 5.31% and the second group (low cases) had an average inflation rate of 1.68%. In other words consumer price increases among high-infection countries were more than triple those of low-infection countries. Moreover when compared to 2019 (i.e. pre-pandemic) the first group experienced an increase in inflation by 1.52% while the second group experienced a decrease in inflation by 0.28%.

Public health policy changes and implications for the food industry

The recent surge of Delta variant cases suggests that the U.S. has entered a fourth wave of the pandemic. Pending FDA’s full approval businesses and government agencies will likely require vaccinations for their employees and customers.

In the U.K. the government will launch daily COVID testing of food sector workers to tackle its ‘pingdemic.”

In France the government requires “vaccine passport” for anyone who wants to enter a theater museum theme park cultural center shopping mall train bus restaurant bar or cafe.

In China the government partnered with McDonald’s to offer free ice cream to boost its vaccination efforts.

A number of food-related companies are stepping up ahead of government mandates:

ALDI Chobani Darden Restaurants McDonald’s Starbucks Target and Trader Joe’s are providing paid time off for vaccinations.

Amazon Lidl Bolthouse Farms Instacart JBS USA Pilgrim’s and Kroger are giving employees cash bonuses to get vaccinated.

Amazon is also providing on-site vaccination for its U.S. front-line employees. Bolthouse Farms and Houston’s Legacy Restaurants hosted vaccine “pop-ups.”

Michelin-starred restaurant Eleven Madison Park requires all workers to be vaccinated.

Safety and Mobility are keys to return to normalcy

In a recent update of the “Anticipated Vaccine Adoption & Impact on the CPG Industry” report IRI pointed out that consumers’ willingness to restore normal work and shopping patterns will depend on vaccine adoption. Understanding the evolution of social mobility is key to assess demand and supply in the foreseeable future. In the framework of a “new normal” IRI’s current forecast of resuming “normal” mobility is summer 2022.

Projecting future inflation is a more difficult task. “I think trying to predict where inflation is going to be in a few years is a mug’s game” said Kristin Forbes an economist at M.I.T. and a former official at the United States Treasury and the Bank of England. “Policymakers need to be ready for different scenarios…If things recover faster than expected we know how to deal with that. If things don’t recover that’s a harder situation.” The longer and to a greater degree that the pandemic can’t be contained the more challenging it will be for both consumers and businesses.

The company’s plans were confirmed earlier this year when it announced it would be restructuring some of its American sites which also involved the closure of a further manufacturing facility based in Atlanta Georgia shifting production to other locations in the country.

As the business previously explained the move – which the company explained to Confectionery Production impacting around 600 staff in New Jersey at its Nabisco site that had operated for decades comes as the business seeks to re-focus its biscuit manufacturing to meet changing consumer demands.

A spokesperson for the US business stressed that it had offered a range of support measures for those affected by the move through supporting them find other roles across the company as well as in delivering career support for those who would be leaving the business.

Consequently the company said it will re-purpose its US biscuit operations with owned-and-operated bakeries on the East Coast Midwest and West Coast in Richmond VA Chicago/Naperville IL and Portland OR. These owned-and operated sites will be further supported by US-based external manufacturing which has been an important part of the company’s regional biscuit manufacturing network for many decades.

The company has previously stated it was considering closure of its New Jersey and Atlanta sites last November as they were no long considered strategically significant locations. It acknowledged that both sites face significant operational challenges including declining infrastructure and outdated production capabilities which would have required significant investment to bring them to the modernised state.

“This was not an easy decision to make but as we continue to strengthen our leadership in snacking and address changing consumer behaviours we must focus on sites that are best positioned to meet our future needs” said Glen Walter Executive Vice President & President North America on its original decision.

“We understand the impact this will have on our colleagues at these bakeries many of whom have been

with our company for many years and we will dedicate ourselves to working with the unions and our

employees to ensure that they will be cared for and supported through this transition.”

As part of the move the Oreo manufacturing “Line of the Future” and Oreo cookie grind production currently in Fair Lawn will be moved to the company’s biscuit bakery in Richmond VA.

Mondelēz International has a significant business presence in the United States which is the largest market for the company globally including its global headquarters in Chicago Illinois and North American headquarters in East Hanover New Jersey.

KEY METRIC: Monster’s shares are up almost 30% this year. Each exec earned about $15.5 million in compensation last year.

BIG BREAK: Immigrants from South Africa entered the beverage business in 1992 with the purchase of Anaheim-based Hansen Natural Corp. Sacks had left behind a career with one of the biggest law firms in Johannesburg to seek his fortune in the U.S. Schlosberg with experience in packaging had moved to the U.K. The two bought a public company just as the “New Age” category of waters flavored drinks and other alternatives to Coke and other sodas were emerging. Energy drinks in particular proved a source of growth. Coca-Cola Co. paid $2.15 billion for 16.7% of the company in 2015; it now has a 19.3% stake in company.

PORTFOLIO: Beyond beverages the duo—who in January took on the co-CEO titles—are among the area’s largest private investors in OC commercial real estate having been involved in office purchases here valued at more than $600 million over the past five years according to Business Journal data. Sacks and Schlosberg were part of group that in 2019 bought 2040 Main St. the Irvine office that holds the local headquarters of law firm Knobbe Martens. The building sold for a reported $130 million. Also in 2019 Sacks and Schlosberg were part of group that paid $116 million for nearby 2211 Michelson office tower. Many of the duo recent investments were made in ventures with Irvine-based real estate investment group Greenlaw Partners.

(Nicole Hall/U.S. Army Reserve)

In the waning days of the U.S. presence at Bagram Airfield Marine Corps veteran Justin Modeste knew the can of energy drink he had was valuable and rare.

“Probably the remaining supply of red Rip-it in the country” he wrote in a post shared to several Facebook groups where the base’s denizens bought sold and traded various goods. “Act now to get your hands on the last few drops of this nectar from the gods. No lowball offers I know what I got.”

The post included a photo of a short opened 8-ounce can of the fruity energy drink that has fueled U.S. wartime operations since 2004 by the tens of millions and has become a staple for troops veterans and contractors alike. His asking price: $500.

“It was indeed my last can of Rip It” Modeste said in a phone interview in early July about the photo he’d jokingly posted weeks earlier. He’d planned to snap the photo before popping the can’s top and downing half of it “but I couldn’t wait to dig in.”

Energy drinks and tobacco became hot commodities as base residents hunted for diminishing supplies in the hectic weeks before the U.S. left seemingly overnight in early July.

Many went from dining at bountiful cafeterias to subsisting on Meals Ready to Eat but Army culinary specialists were sent in to serve up hot food at least through June 25.

The simple tastes of ‘Camp Cupcake’

A group of four Army cooks recently returned to Kuwait after spending several weeks running the North Dining Facility on Bagram. Other cafeterias had been closed and civilian contract workers sent home.

“We were feeding over 2000 soldiers” said Sgt. Nicole Hall of the Army Reserve’s 310th Sustainment Command quoted in an Army statement this week.

On 12-hour shifts they served up scrambled eggs steak vegetables and “everything you could possibly think of” Master Sgt. Lloyd Cossey said in the statement.

Throughout much of the war the cafeterias on forward operating bases Modeste called “Camp Cupcake” hosted steak and lobster dinners on Fridays. Modeste was partial to another delicacy Bagram’s DFACs served those nights: “the best mac and cheese known to man.”

Toward the end the troops were happy just to have hot meals Hall said as cited in the Army statement. “Their favorite meal was the grilled cheese.”

Meanwhile planes never stopped coming and going said Staff Sgt. Steve Augusten another cook in the statement. Bomb disposal crews were doing “constant controlled detonations explosions all the time.”

With more than 95% of the withdrawal complete the military has hauled out over 980 C-17 cargo plane loads of gear U.S. Central Command said this week.

But as creature comforts became rare at the airbase that served as the U.S. logistical hub north of Kabul for nearly 20 years contractors began to complain said Modeste who’d deployed to a similarly “cupcakey” base in Iraq on one of several overseas tours during his 8 1/2 years in the Marines.

He’d been conditioned for Bagram’s final spartan days during an “eye-opening” deployment to Helmand province over a decade ago. His team lived on MREs and took solar showers during long stretches at an observation post atop an “unlivable mountain” in 2009 and 2010.

“It could be worse” Modeste would remind himself this summer.

In this comment on a Facebook trading forum for residents of Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan on Friday July 9 2021 user Rob Fisher showed off the last two Rip Its he was able to get his hands on at the base in late 2020.

Residents of the sprawling base used bikes to get around throughout the war. (Chad Garland/Stars and Stripes)

The last ‘trickle’ of energy drinks

Into mid-June Facebook groups like “Bagram Yard Sale” and “Bagram Craigslist” had ads offering random items like duct tape power cables foot lockers TVs tools microwaves gym equipment and personal Wi-Fi devices.

One user jokingly offered an MRE labeled as a “stool hardener” for $1000. Another advertised a bike with ape-hanger handlebars billing it a “chick magnet” likely to net marriage proposals.

“Make an offer” the user wrote. “Free to an American soldier.”

As exchanges and dining facilities closed things got dicey for those with energy drink and tobacco habits some of whom turned to these groups offering to buy cases of Monster or Red Bull packs of cigarettes and logs of dip. Others offered their dwindling supplies in trade.

Modeste’s “last can” ad came after years of being supplied “cases and cases” of the Rip Its that typically filled drink coolers at the dining facilities he said. He’d first tasted the tantalizing beverage in Iraq where he’d stuff his cargo pockets with it — his personal record was smuggling out 12 that way.

“That was my life force” he said adding that the habit “trickled into contractor life” when he arrived at Bagram in 2014 to support the counter-rocket artillery and mortar systems.

Rip It was adopted as the energy drink of choice to be supplied at dining facilities in 2004 “because it was the most cost-effective” Army spokesman Wayne Hall told Stars and Stripes in late 2018.

In the decade from 2009 to 2018 the Defense Logistics Agency shipped more than 175 million cans of it to U.S. Central Command — $165 million worth — data DLA provided to Stars and Stripes shows.

It’s also sold by the case or by the can in the coolers of higher-end Kabul grocery stores and the stalls of the bustling Bush Bazaar likely pilfered from military supplies.

While it’s available in the U.S. often in discount retailers like dollar stores Modeste says it’s not the same as the stuff shipped downrange.

In an exclusive interview with NIKKEI Financial Hirano a top Japanese banker of international caliber revealed the whole picture behind MUFG's capital tie-up negotiations with the American investment bank and discussed the problems of and expectations for Japan's economy and financial sector which are mired in difficulties describing his opinions as ""my last words.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFkdmlzb3JodWIuY29tL3Vicy1zY29vcHMtdXAtMTEtMi1tbG4tbWVycmlsbC1wcml2YXRlLXdlYWx0aC10ZWFtLWluLW5ldy15b3JrLWNpdHkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,UBS Scoops Up $11.2-Mln Merrill Private Wealth Team in New York City,"An $11.2-million Merrill Lynch Private Wealth Management team left for rival wirehouse UBS Wealth Management USA on Friday in New York City adding to a growing list of departures among large teams at the “thundering herd.”

The group is led by Stephen M. Kincade and Alexander S. Fridell and had overseen $1.45 billion in client assets according to a person familiar with their practice. The team also includes Stephen’s son Chris who is a junior advisor and client associates Zach Kingsley Jessica McEntee and Elle Schiowitz.

They had been well-known at Merrill’s private wealth group which includes around 200 teams serving ultra-wealthy customers for the size of their practice and also their well-heeled customers. Their client roster includes notables such as hedge fund manager Leon Cooperman according to a second source close to their practice.

Reached at his new UBS office Kincade who started his career at Goldman Sachs in 1985 declined to comm_ent on the move and also declined to comment or confirm any potential customers. He and Fridell had joined Merrill in 2012 from Barclays Capital in New York according to BrokerCheck.

A spokesperson for UBS declined to comment and a spokesperson for Merrill Lynch did not return a request for comment.

Merrill Wealth head Andy Sieg last week identified “competitive attrition” as an issue that required attention from the firm’s leadership. Losses of experienced brokers rose to around 5% annualized in the second quarter after running at around 4% in recent years a spokesman confirmed.

The company since 2019 has not disclosed the number of core brokers in its wealth business. Total headcount of advisors at Bank of America including thousands of private bankers and consumer-bank based brokers fell 2.1% in the second quarter and 5.9% year-over-year to 19385 the company said last week.

Recruiters have said that anecdotally departures of a number of high profile teams have been steady in recent years. Kincade and his team had worked on the same floor at One Bryant Park also known as Bank of America Tower as a $7-million prive wealth group led by Louis Meltzer Jacob M. Dunn and Hadi Fakhoury who left last September to join Morgan Stanley Wealth Management.

Kincade and his group had evaluated other firms including Morgan Stanley but opted for UBS because it was a better fit for their relatively transactional practice which had a focus on syndicate business the second source said.

UBS has also shown a willingness to open its wallet to compete with high-end offers from Morgan Stanley and other aggressive recruiters for some high-end teams recruiters have said.

Kincade also worked at Grigsby Brandford & Co. and Lehman Brothers before joining Barclays in 2009 according to his BrokerCheck. Fridell started at Citigroup’s Smith Barney in 2007 shifted to Lehman Brothers the following year and worked at Morgan Stanley for a stint before joining Barclays in 2009.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzhhMzI4YWY0LWI4ZjItNDhjNS04MmE5LWQ3ZGMxYzM0NWUxY9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wall Street doubles down on lending 'cheap money' to the rich,"Try unlimited access Only MX$100 for 4 weeks

Morgan Stanley tech analysts Mary Meeker and Chris DePuy knew the world was on the cusp of something big in 1996. They drafted a 323-page report expressing their high hopes for the internet saying it could be ""one of the hottest new markets to develop in years.""

Looking back on the report now shows just how far the internet has come in 25 years.

Salesforce needed 14 years as a public company to reach a market cap of $100 billion. Getting there required three multibillion-dollar acquisitions and four distinct revenue sources. When Zoom topped the $100 billion mark last year it had been public for just over 14 months. The company was reliant on a single product and had completed just one tiny acquisition. While it's still just a toddler on the Nasdaq Zoom is now being forced to take on adult responsibilities for investors thanks to its unexpectedly rapid ascent. The video chat company's historic growth during the Covid-19 pandemic vaulted its market cap from $9.2 billion at the time of its 2019 IPO to a peak of $159 billion in October putting it tentatively even with Cisco . Zoom has lost about one-third of its value since then despite reporting 191% revenue growth in the latest quarter as investors prepare for a post-pandemic future and as competition picks up most notably from Microsoft Teams. Still Zoom is among the 25-most valuable North American tech companies and the only one in that pack to go public in the last four years. Shopify and Snap which went public in 2015 and 2017 respectively are the only companies in the group that trade for a richer multiple to sales.

In other words the stock market is giving Zoom the tools to become a major dealmaker. And Zoom is taking advantage announcing earlier this week the $14.7 billion purchase of Five9  which sells cloud-based software to call centers. ""It allows them to use their currency to buy things that are impactful"" said Alfred Chuang a partner at venture firm Race Capital who previously co-founded BEA Systems and sold it to Oracle for $8.5 billion in 2008. ""I can't imagine this will be last one."" The Five9 deal is one of the 10 largest U.S. enterprise software transactions on record according to FactSet and is bigger than any acquisition ever by Amazon  Google  Oracle  Cisco or Adobe . At about 23 times Five9's expected 2022 revenue it's also the second-priciest software deal on a price-to-sales basis behind only Salesforce's $27 billion purchase of Slack which closed earlier this month.

Chuang who has been friends with Zoom CEO Eric Yuan since his pre-Zoom days at WebEx says Yuan is now in a position familiar to Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff whose company has more than doubled in value since mid-2018 to $240 billion. Both companies are set up to be cloud consolidators as automation changes the future of work and the enterprise software stack of the future gets built Chuang said. In the three years since reaching a $100 billion market cap Salesforce has completed four billion-dollar-plus deals including Slack and the $15.7 billion purchase of Tableau. ""Not everything has worked out"" Chuang said but he argues it's important to take take big swings even if the business is currently in good shape. ""When you have a very fast-growing company and become very successful most people don't want to rock the boat"" he said. ""Acquisitions are not only useful to acquire customers but are super critical to satisfy a product vision you may have.""

The Cisco connection

Zoom's initial talks with Five9 date back to last year according to people familiar with the matter. The CEOs who both previously worked on collaboration products at Cisco know each other well and forged a product integration in 2019 when Zoom launched a phone offering. Yuan was a lead engineer at WebEx when the company was acquired by Cisco in 2007 and Five9 CEO Rowan Trollope ran all of Cisco's collaboration products including WebEx until taking the Five9 job in 2018. They never overlapped at Cisco — Yuan left to start Zoom a year before Trollope joined — but the connection is key as they both saw the challenges of retrofitting a legacy technology company for the cloud era. Acquisition talks cooled for a while and picked up in the last three months said people with knowledge of the transaction who asked not to be named because the discussions were confidential. That's when Goldman Sachs started advising Zoom on a deal and Five9 hired Frank Quattrone's Qatalyst Partners. Zoom also shuffled internal responsibilities this year putting CFO Kelly Steckelberg in charge of business development a job that had previously been held by operating chief Aparna Bawa people close to the matter said. Yuan and Steckelberg drove the Five9 deal the people said. Bawa has assumed increased responsibilities elsewhere in the business. She oversees security privacy and government relations which all took center stage as Zoom became a widely-used service at large enterprises as well as in education health care and among religious organizations.

Representatives from Zoom and Five9 declined to comment. At a Morgan Stanley investor event in March Steckelberg was asked about Zoom's plans for the call center. ""Contact center is an absolutely really important part of the phone strategy"" Steckelberg said in response. ""The way we approach that today is through partnering. We have great relationships with Five9. Eric and Rowan are very good friends."" Zoom's goal is to be not only a video service used for meetings with co-workers and clients but to become the center of all work communication including for customer service reps in call centers. Yuan went a step further in June on Zoom's quarterly earnings call. He responded to an analyst's question about contact center expansion by telling investors ""Stay tuned you will see something."" He followed by suggesting that details could be revealed around the time of the company's Zoomtopia conference in September. ""I hope we will be able to do more"" he said indicating that Zoom may go beyond integrations with call center technology providers.

Buy vs. build

A big reason why an agreement took so long to come together was because both stocks were so volatile people familiar with the talks said. Shares of Zoom and Five9 moved 10% or more in a single week on several occasions this year making it difficult to come to terms. Ultimately the acquisition price was a modest 13% premium to Five9's last closing price before the announcement. The deal is projected to close in the first half of 2022 and Trollope will continue to run Five9 as a president of Zoom. Five9 adds a projected $650 million in revenue next year to the $4.8 billion in sales that analysts expect from Zoom according to StreetAccount. On the investor call following the announcement Yuan and Trollope said that common customers have been telling them they want to count on a single vendor that can provide communications technology for internal purposes as well as customer service. Zoom could invest in building the product itself but customers ""do not want to wait"" Yuan said. Analysts like BTIG's Matt VanVliet said the decision to buy instead of build is the right one. ""Overall we are encouraged by Zoom's strategy to supercharge its platform with this acquisition rather than rely purely on its own internal R&D chops which would have taken years to scale"" wrote VanVliet who has a buy recommendation on Zoom in a report on July 19. Zoom has a long way to go before it can claim to have a portfolio of cloud software products like Salesforce Adobe and ServiceNow . Late last year the company entered the live events space with the launch of a homegrown product called OnZoom expanding the video platform beyond the workplace and betting that online gatherings in some form are here to stay. In July Zoom hired Abhisht Arora a 21-year Microsoft veteran and Teams program manager as its head of corporate strategy reporting directly to Yuan. Between development of new products and big acquisitions into parallel markets Yuan is trying to ensure that Zoom is more than just a pandemic stock and that its status as an enterprise giant remains long after we say goodbye to Covid-19. — CNBC's Alex Sherman contributed to this report.

However he did have a reliable bus — the Dexter Bus to be exact — and on Saturdays instead of sleeping in or bingeing on cartoons Hall jumped on the bus and headed to work.

The other passengers on the bus had no way of knowing then that the young man dressed in shirt and tie was already “management” and a “customer service expert.” But he was prepared to be those things and more when the bus would stop at Livernois and Santa Maria in the heart of the Bagley community on the city’s northwest side.

Awaiting Hall across the street was the family business. And more than 30 years later the business now named Hallstarz Business Center is still Hall's destination. The only difference now is that he arrives six days a week. And in his own vehicle.

A neighborhood source for packing shipping printing and other business services. Created 36 years ago by a Detroit couple Milton Hall Jr. and Vanessa Hall. The business is now run by their oldest son Mario Hall with help from his five brothers. Rodney Coleman-Robinson Detroit Free Press

“I’ve been dealing with customers all of my life” said the 45-year-old Hall who now manages the company’s day-to-day operations. He recalls being about 13 years old when the Dexter Bus began dropping him off for days of spontaneous action including answering phones sending money shining shoes working the cash register — and counting back the customer’s change the old-school way by doing the math in his head — and even working the lottery machine in a pinch. “To walk in here daily and see how far we have come I’m just honored to work in the family business.

""I’m here with a purpose.”

And so is the family business. Hallstarz is housed in a building that used to be a Bank of the Commonwealth branch. There was a time when it was common for families nearby to have silverware toasters or other gifts that they received from the bank branch for being good savers. However today in that neighborhood there are no full-service bank branches to be seen for at least 3 miles. But after setting up shop 36 years ago Hallstarz has become an anchor for the neighborhood while providing packing shipping printing and a variety of other services all under one roof.

“Cities are only as strong as their neighborhoods. Therefore to have a Black family-owned business come into a location where a bank branch once stood and provide needed services for 36 years is not only a significant accomplishment but also a vital economic boost for that neighborhood” said Ken Harris president and CEO of the National Business League the country’s first and largest trade association for Black businesses. “I also think that it is no question that Hallstarz is one of those entrepreneurial endeavors that continues to serve as an economic model toward the resurgence of local Black businesses throughout the neighborhood today particularly along the Livernois corridor.”

When the subject of being important to the community is brought up to Hall a prideful and humble tone can be detected in his voice as he begins to explain some of his customary practices like making sure every customer hears “Welcome to Hallstarz” regardless of how busy things might be when they walk into the shop.

“It’s about respect for the city of Detroit and respect for our community. Without the community we simply have no business” Hall said matter of factly. “We didn’t set out to replace a bank but we did have a mindset that we would use every corner of the building to offer services. And from that we became a place where our customers and community could take care of most business needs.”

Serving the community is truly a family affair at Hallstarz. The organization chart includes Hall's mother Vanessa who was the inspiration behind the TRU Pro Tax Service the tax preparation business inside Hallstarz. A registered nurse she also established and manages the All My Children Maternal Infant Health Program and the nonprofit All My Children which both operate within Hallstarz.

Hall's brother Marquis assists with tax preparation and helped remodel the building that houses Hallstarz. In addition Marquis helps with driver skills testing for A&M Driver Testing which along with Hall of Fame Driving School — established by another brother Milton III — all are headquartered inside Hallstarz.

Mylan who falls next in the line of brothers after Milton created and operates MLH Construction which handled the total remodeling of the company’s building in 2006 and continues to provide maintenance and repairs when needed. The printing and shipping services offered by the business are managed by Martez the second-youngest brother who also is responsible for offering property casualty life and health insurance services at Hallstarz. Malik the youngest brother is equally versatile in his contributions to the family business which has included assisting with running services and being involved with remodeling the building on Livernois.

And then there's dad lovingly known by his middle name Dewain who acquired Hallstarz's current location in October 1985 and as Mario describes it continues to “mentor and motivate.”

“The community — that is the family” Dewain Hall explained. “I always believed that if you provide a service to your community you help yourself out and later you don’t have to worry about getting knocked in the head because you’re giving people in your community what they need to move their lives forward.”

Dewain Hall 65 proudly tells a story about Hallstarz's origins including how the company “derived from HVM (Hall’s Variety Mall) Incorporated and prior to that Hall’s Shoe Repair” which was established by his father Milton Hall Sr. who in 1963 “started his venture of being a self sole proprietor.”

When Dewain Hall gets to the part of the story when he and Vanessa purchased the 2300-square-foot building located at 17301 Livernois in 1985 he talks about feeling like a “little kid with a big truck” because the space was significantly larger than the cozy building that housed Hall’s Shoe Repair No. 2 on West McNichols just west of Livernois. And for the big space Dewain Hall had a big vision involving services — many services — because as he put it just like a good African American prepared feast “it takes many sides for a complete meal.”

But Dewain Hall said the most important ingredients to the company’s success was when his sons became “members” which began in earnest when Mario returned to work for the family business after graduating from Grambling State University with an engineering degree in 2000.

“I have to commend all of my children they’re doing a tremendous job and they brought the vision I had of a family business to fruition” said Dewain Hall whose company also has regularly hired young people from the community through the years often the sons or daughters of longtime customers that see a positive first-time employment opportunity for their children at Hallstarz.

Dewain Hall jokes that the fact that he can reminisce about the company’s history in the middle of the day is further proof that his sons and other staff are doing a pretty good job. However he also lets it be known that he is not done “pressing” just yet. In fact he is working on establishing a second Hallstarz location at 4440 E. Seven Mile which is tentatively planned to open midyear 2022. A man of deep faith Dewain Hall also does not shy away from being a role model when it comes to African American entrepreneurship in Detroit. And he has provided advice for others that may be considering a similar path.

“I always thought if only I had that $1 million loan” said Dewain Hall with a momentary tone of longing in his voice and then his tone and tune changed. “But even if you were to receive that loan you still have to understand what it takes to work the business. It still has to come from you to make it work. And if your mind is determined you can make it work regardless of the obstacles. “",,,,,,,,,,,,

The technology sector has been the most impressive part of the stock market for some time now -- certainly over the past decade as it provided the propulsion for the longest bull market in U.S. history. How things will play out over the next 10 years is impossible to know but experts expect tech companies will continue to flourish transforming industries from finance to healthcare to energy as they blaze new trails with artificial intelligence robotics and more.

One excellent way for investors to capitalize on the general trend of technological advancement -- but without betting on which companies will provide the breakthroughs -- is by buying technology-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs). These offer both access to companies with great potential and diversification to temper the risks.

Two of the best technology-focused funds on the market right now are the Invesco QQQ ETF (QQQ 0.22%) and the Fidelity MSCI Informational Technology Index ETF (FTEC -0.03%). But which is the better buy?

Invesco QQQ

The Invesco QQQ is one of the most popular ETFs on the planet with about $180 billion in assets under management. It tracks the Nasdaq 100 index which is made up of the 100 largest nonfinancial stocks on that exchange. Those happen to be primarily tech sector stocks. As of June 30 the ETF had about 49% of its assets in technology stocks 19% in communication services and 17% in consumer discretionary stocks. Its three largest holdings were Apple (10.99% of assets) Microsoft (9.81%) and Amazon (8.34%).

Its performance over the years has been fantastic. Through the second quarter the Invesco QQQ was up by 44% over the prior 12 months has grown at an annualized rate of 28% over the past five years and a rate of 21% over the past 10 years. Year to date the ETF was up roughly 14% through July 20. Its expense ratio is 0.20% which is below its category average. In terms of its risk measures it has a standard deviation of 27.7% and a beta of 1.02.

Fidelity MSCI Information Technology Index ETF

The Fidelity MSCI Information Technology Index ETF tracks the MSCI USA IMI Information Technology Index which tracks about 350 IT stocks including large- mid- and small-cap names. The fund employs a representative sampling strategy which means it invests in a representative sample of securities that have an investment profile similar to the index. The securities selected are based on several factors -- including market capitalization and industry weightings fundamental characteristics and liquidity measures. Thus it invests at least 80% of its assets in the stocks in the index. Its three largest holdings are Apple Microsoft and Nvidia.

Launched in 2013 this Fidelity ETF does not yet have a 10-year track record to compare to the QQQ but it has performed extremely well over the period we can measure. Over the past 12 months through June 30 it has returned 44% and over the last five years it has posted annualized returns of 30.8%. Since its inception in 2013 it has an annualized return of 23.7%. And year to date as of July 20 it was up 14%. It has a low expense ratio of 0.08% well below the category average. Also looking at risk metrics it has a beta of 1.07 and a standard deviation of 9.58%.

Which is the better buy?

While these are both considered tech funds there are some significant differences between them. The Fidelity ETF is purely a tech fund while the Invesco QQQ is largely focused on tech stocks but is diversified into other sectors as well. That said the Fidelity ETF is more diversified within the IT sector with holdings that run the market-cap gamut and with more than three times as many holdings as the Invesco QQQ.

These are both excellent ETFs but if I had to pick one I'd go with the Fidelity ETF. It outperformed the Invesco QQQ significantly over the past five years and has had excellent returns since its inception. It also has a considerably lower expense ratio and more consistent returns as measured by its standard deviation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmphcGFudGltZXMuY28uanAvbmV3cy8yMDIxLzA3LzI1L2J1c2luZXNzL2hvbmcta29uZy10ZWNoLWluZGV4L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,China crackdown makes Hong Kong index world's biggest tech loser,"An index launched a year ago to give investors greater exposure to China’s internet giants is now the world’s worst-performing major technology gauge.

The Hang Seng Tech Index has been on a roller-coaster ride in the last 12 months. The gauge which marks its one-year anniversary on Tuesday was up 59% at its February peak but has since seen more than $551 billion in market value wiped out amid Beijing’s clampdown on the sector.

That has reduced the gain to nearly 6% compared to more than 40% for the MSCI World Information Technology Index and the Nasdaq-100 Index. The measure also lags onshore peers: the ChiNext Index is up 35% in the period.",,,,,,,,,

With the combination complete the ticker symbol will change and start trading under ""LCID"" on Monday morning just a day later than previously expected. Churchill Capital IV the special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) taking the nascent electric vehicle (EV) maker public held its special shareholder meeting on Thursday but faced a minor setback.

Here's what investors need to know.

Dilution confusion

There was some confusion among retail investors over one of the SPAC's proposals which would amend the company's charter and authorize it to increase the total number of shares. This proposal was necessary in order to complete the transaction but misinformation about it had been spreading on social media in recent months.

Some investors saw the move as highly dilutive based on misinterpretations of regulatory filings which details a 2.61 exchange ratio of Churchill Capital IV shares to Lucid stock. But that only applies to the previous incarnation of Lucid and its investors such as Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund and employees who received stock-based compensation. In other words the exchange ratio is not particularly relevant to the SPAC's public investors who incorrectly feared that excessive dilution could adversely impact the value of the investment.

The higher share authorization was also necessary to accommodate the shares being sold to institutional investors participating in the PIPE (private investment in public equity) which is actually bringing more money ($2.5 billion) to the table than the SPAC itself ($2.1 billion).

Additionally Lucid will likely need to raise capital in a few years since entering the automotive industry is one of the most capital-intensive endeavors on the planet. Future capital raises will be dilutive but the company will need that money to fund future growth.

We extend our sincere thanks to our customers shareholders fans and employees for their continued support.https://t.co/BlmGyfpo0V pic.twitter.com/hquMJxjZFE July 23 2021

Churchill Capital IV and Lucid extended the deadline for shareholders to vote and executives pleaded with investors to vote in favor of all proposals in order to cross the finish line. Those efforts worked and the companies have sealed the deal.

""Lucid has further increased its momentum as we gear up to make the first customer deliveries of our Lucid Air lineup of electric sedans later this year"" Lucid CEO Peter Rawlinson said in a statement. ""We are making significant investments in the long-term growth and innovation of our company and we will continue to bring to bear world-class technology to positively impact mankind's transition to sustainable mobility.""

With the de-SPAC transaction closed Lucid will receive approximately $4.4 billion (after transaction expenses) in cash from the SPAC merger and it can now focus on the final stretch ahead of its first customer deliveries. The company recently said that it now has over 10000 vehicle reservations and has decided to accelerate its manufacturing plan due to strong demand.

Investing is becoming difficult by the day even for smart money. The entire hedge fund industry is feeling the reverberations of the changing financial landscape.

(NASDAQ:CXDO) Shares?,"A look at the shareholders of Crexendo Inc. (NASDAQ:CXDO) can tell us which group is most powerful. Insiders often own a large chunk of younger smaller companies while huge companies tend to have institutions as shareholders. I generally like to see some degree of insider ownership even if only a little. As Nassim Nicholas Taleb said 'Don’t tell me what you think tell me what you have in your portfolio.

Crexendo is not a large company by global standards. It has a market capitalization of US$133m which means it wouldn't have the attention of many institutional investors. In the chart below we can see that institutions own shares in the company. Let's delve deeper into each type of owner to discover more about Crexendo.

View our latest analysis for Crexendo

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Crexendo?

Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.

As you can see institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Crexendo. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Crexendo's historic earnings and revenue below but keep in mind there's always more to the story.

Hedge funds don't have many shares in Crexendo. With a 48% stake CEO Steven Mihaylo is the largest shareholder. Bard Associates Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 2.3% of common stock and The Vanguard Group Inc. holds about 2.2% of the company stock.

After doing some more digging we found that the top 2 shareholders collectively control more than half of the company's shares implying that they have considerable power to influence the company's decisions.

Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There is some analyst coverage of the stock but it could still become more well known with time.

Insider Ownership Of Crexendo

The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business but the CEO will answer to the board even if he or she is a member of it.

Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.

Our most recent data indicates that insiders own the majority of Crexendo Inc.. This means they can collectively make decisions for the company. So they have a US$73m stake in this US$133m business. Most would argue this is a positive showing strong alignment with shareholders. You can click here to see if those insiders have been buying or selling.

General Public Ownership

The general public with a 38% stake in the company will not easily be ignored. This size of ownership while considerable may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Concert Pharmaceuticals?

Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register especially if they are growing.

As you can see institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Concert Pharmaceuticals. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Concert Pharmaceuticals' historic earnings and revenue below but keep in mind there's always more to the story.

Hedge funds don't have many shares in Concert Pharmaceuticals. RA Capital Management L.P. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 9.4% of shares outstanding. For context the second largest shareholder holds about 6.7% of the shares outstanding followed by an ownership of 4.5% by the third-largest shareholder. In addition we found that Roger Tung the CEO has 2.5% of the shares allocated to their name.

After doing some more digging we found that the top 14 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.

Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.

Insider Ownership Of Concert Pharmaceuticals

The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business but the CEO will answer to the board even if he or she is a member of it.

Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.

I can report that insiders do own shares in Concert Pharmaceuticals Inc.. As individuals the insiders collectively own US$6.7m worth of the US$113m company. This shows at least some alignment but I usually like to see larger insider holdings. You can click here to see if those insiders have been buying or selling.

General Public Ownership

With a 30% ownership the general public have some degree of sway over Concert Pharmaceuticals. This size of ownership while considerable may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.

Private Equity Ownership

With a stake of 16% private equity firms could influence the Concert Pharmaceuticals board. Some might like this because private equity are sometimes activists who hold management accountable. But other times private equity is selling out having taking the company public.

Public Company Ownership

It appears to us that public companies own 3.7% of Concert Pharmaceuticals. This may be a strategic interest and the two companies may have related business interests. It could be that they have de-merged. This holding is probably worth investigating further.

Next Steps:

While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company there are other factors that are even more important. Consider for instance the ever-present spectre of investment risk. We've identified 3 warning signs with Concert Pharmaceuticals  and understanding them should be part of your investment process.

Some Got Mad Anyway.,"SPOILER WARNING: Do not read if you’ve not seen the first five episodes of “Masters of the Universe: Revelation” streaming now on Netflix.

Kevin Smith nearly turned down “He-Man.”

In early 2019 the iconoclastic filmmaker podcast host and foul-mouthed bon vivant got a call from his agent. Mattel the toy company wanted to meet but they required that Smith sign an NDA first. So Smith asked where their offices were located.

“He’s like ‘El Segundo’ and I’m like ‘Fucking Santa Monica? I’m not going out there!'” Smith said. “So I passed. And then they called back and he was like ‘They said they’d come to your house.’ I was like ‘Oh that’s great. Yeah send them over. I’ll talk whatever they want to talk about.'”

Sometime later Rob David vice president of content creative at Mattel Television rolled up to Smith’s Hollywood Hills home. After Smith signed the NDA David explained why he was there: He wanted Smith to help him make a Netflix series based on the 1980s animated kids show “He-Man and the Masters of the Universe.”

Anyone familiar with Smith’s sui generis oeuvre of profane indies like “Clerks” “Chasing Amy” and “Dogma” might be surprised that Mattel would think of Smith as the right creative shepherd for an earnest swords-and-sorcery property about a hulking Adonis in a furry speedo and chest-plate. Smith certainly was.

Popular on Variety

“I never would have put that together” he said. He was a young teenager during “He-Man’s” run from 1983 to 1985 and he wasn’t exactly a die-hard fan. “I almost hate-watched it because I was like this show’s for babies” he said. “They have one of the baddest-ass villains in history Skeletor visually incredible and all they did was somersault and not really fight. Nobody ever got stabbed. But it was the ’80s so you watched everything that was on.”

David however had a specific pitch for Smith. Mattel was already working with Netflix on a CG-animated “He-Man” series that would reboot and update the property for a new generation of children. And the company was developing a live-action feature film adaptation that would also bring He-Man’s world of Eternia into a 21st century cinematic context.

But David and Netflix’s director of original series Ted Biaselli had hit upon a third approach to the property: A show that would be “for those adult fans who grew up loving ‘He-Man'” David said. “Not to even reimagine: Let’s just do a direct continuation of the classic ’80s era.”

Separate from his feature film work Smith had authored comic book runs of Marvel’s “Daredevil” and DC’s “Green Arrow” in the late 1990s and early 2000s that David greatly admired for their fealty to the subject matter with none of Smith’s signature dick and fart jokes. “He’d taken some of the great stuff that Frank Miller had done with ‘Daredevil’ and found a way to honor that but then build on it” David said.

David and Biaselli wanted Smith to do the same with “He-Man”: Take the show from the 1980s and continue that story with those characters only now for an adult audience. Finally He-Man and Skeletor could really do battle and one — or both! — could get stabbed.

Smith loved the idea.

""I know what a fan base reacts like when they don't get the thing they grew up watching.""

Kevin Smith

“[Biaselli’s] like ‘I yearn to watch the show I thought I was watching in childhood. That’s what I’m looking for here the same show but people can die. Can you do that?'” Smith said. “And I was like ‘That’s the only thing I can do.’”

“Honestly if it had been anything else outside of that — if they were like ‘We want you to reinvent this for the modern age’ — that would have scared me off creatively because I’m not that inventive” Smith continued. “And also because I know what a fan base reacts like when they don’t get the thing they grew up watching. You think I’m gonna be the fall guy for that? If I’m involved in a thing it’s going to be true to what it is. It’s gonna be true to the franchise.”

And yet a little more than 24 hours after the debut of “Masters of the Universe: Revelation” on Netflix — and despite near universally glowing notices from critics — the show has been “review-bombed” by users posting to Rotten Tomatoes and IMDb. The general consensus among those upset: Smith had indeed not given fans the thing they grew up watching — namely he had not given them He-Man.

By any reasonable measure Smith David and the rest of the creative team were successful in achieving what they set out to do: Make a series that looks and feels like a sophisticated adult continuation of the “He-Man” animated series from the 1980s. Beloved sci-fi composer Bear McCreary (“Battlestar Galactica” “The Walking Dead”) wrote a sweeping score that takes the story seriously. Several locations from the original show are smartly utilized and nearly two dozen characters (Trap Jaw! Tri-Klops! Stinkor!) make memorable appearances. The animation led by directors Patrick Stannard and Adam Conarroe (Netflix’s “Castlevania”) pays loving attention to the design aesthetic of the original — characters drive vehicles that evoke the tie-in He-Man toy line — while upgrading it for an adult eye and sensibility. One example: While He-Man and his alter ego Prince Adam are still voiced by the same actor (this time by “Supergirl’s” Chris Wood) Adam is now a scrawnier more normal looking young man instead of a hulking Adonis who looks exactly like He-Man in regular clothing.

In the first episode however Smith David and the rest of the creative team made a bold creative decision: He-Man (seemingly) dies as does Skeletor (voiced by Mark Hamill) the result of a cataclysmic battle that also leaves Eternia devoid of all magic. While He-Man appears in flashbacks for the rest of the first half of the season he’s missing in action from the main story.

Instead He-Man’s friends and even some of his enemies have to figure out how to bring magic back to Eternia and save all of existence in doing so. In this quest they’re led reluctantly by He-Man’s former loyal compatriot Teela (voiced by Sarah Michelle Gellar) — who still feels devastated and betrayed as the only one in He-Man’s inner-circle who never knew he was also Prince Adam.

In speaking with Variety about these choices it’s clear that the creators and cast of “Revelation” only ever wanted to please fans of the show by getting to do the things the original never could: real stakes and real consequences with nuanced characters imbued with genuine pathos and psychological maturity. But it’s also clear that “Revelation” is a textbook case of the precarious tightrope walk of trying to please fans of a legacy franchise while also trying to avoid merely regurgitating what came before. Especially given that the world of extremely online fandoms — almost always exclusively driven by men — have not responded well when a property previously led by a man suddenly has a woman at its center instead.

After Wood won the role of He-Man — “I went for it just screaming ‘I have the power’ in our closet hoping that my family wasn’t thinking I was losing it” he said with a laugh — discovering in the very first script that his character appears to die was indeed a shock.

“I read it and I was like ‘Wait is that…? Is that how this happens?'” he said. “‘Is this…is there more?'”

As anyone who has seen all five episodes of “Revelation” knows there was more for Wood to do especially in Episode 5 since neither Skeletor nor Prince Adam really died died. But David’s initial pitch to Smith kept Adam alive the entire time. In the midst of a massive battle at Castle Greyskull Skeletor breaks the vessel containing all magic on Eternia and He-Man is forced to split the Sword of Power in two in order to contain the ensuing explosion. In David’s version Adam survived; robbed of his ability to become He-Man he spends the rest of the series figuring out how to build himself back up to his former glory.

“Kevin thought that was terrific” said David. “And then he one-upped me and said ‘What if we don’t just break the Sword of Power? What if we actually break Adam too? What if he dies when we flash forward a few years we really get to explore that — also what is it like for a world without He-Man?'”

In breaking the story for “Revelation” Smith said David pulled out “books of lore” for He-Man and Eternia created by Mattel over the decades since the toy was first created. Between David’s commitment to the history of He-Man and Biaselli’s bone-deep love for the original show Smith felt like he had guard-rails keeping him from going too far afield. Besides his mandate was to make a He-Man show where characters could actually die; what better way to make that clear than killing the show’s main hero and villain from the jump?

“All we have to do is not disavow anything” Smith said. “Nobody’s saying ‘Hey man everything you knew about He-Man was wrong.’ It’s like no everything you knew was absolutely right. And now this is what happened when they finally had their epic battle — and what happened after that.”

“Even though this is a love letter to the 1980s version of ‘Masters of Universe’ we didn’t want to rest on that” added David. “In order for something to be alive it’s got to have the capacity to surprise you. It has to have the capacity to grow.”

Once Wood understood the approach he loved it. “It was jarring but in a really amazing way you know because Skeletor and He-Man there was no real urgency or life or death stakes to their battles [in the original]” he said.

With He-Man’s death locked in Smith looked at the characters who were left in Eternia who could drive the story for the next four episodes. One jumped the to the fore.

“Teela I was particularly interested in because she’s been fucking lied to her entire life” Smith said. “And that to me was drama.”

In Episode 2 Teela is working as a mercenary for hire and her disillusionment with He-Man and alienation from magic work as a kind of allegory for the cynicism of adulthood overshadowing the wonders of childhood. She was the perfect vehicle for what “Revelation” was trying to do: Strip away everything the heroes cared about to get at the heart of who they really are and what makes them heroic.

“My favorite movies are ‘The Empire Strikes Back’ ‘The Wrath of Khan'” said David. “The hero gets really hit hard and then the story becomes about how the hero gets back up again and better and stronger than ever. In basically stripping away all the comforts the hero took for granted the hero reveals to him or herself what truly makes them strong inside and then have to rebuild.”

“We thought by having an unexpected character go on that journey in real time with the audience” he continued “we would be able to really hit just how important He-Man is and just how important those themes are.”

""You really fucking think Mattel Television who hired me and paid me money wants to do a fucking 'Masters of the Universe' show without He-Man? Grow the fuck up man.""

Kevin Smith

When Gellar was first approached about playing Teela however she wasn’t sure she wanted it.

“I thought it’d be a very small role at first because just looking at ‘He-Man’ I didn’t even really necessarily remember her” she said. “I mean maybe vaguely. And then I started reading [the scripts] and I was like ‘Oh she’s the show! OK this is new.'”

In truth Gellar didn’t pay very much attention to the original “He-Man” for the simple reason that the entire world was telling her the show was only for boys.

“I think what’s interesting about the original incarnation was it was very gender specific” she said. “There wasn’t something for me; there wasn’t a character that I saw myself in. And I think that sort of then you realize it’s not about gender right? It’s not necessarily boy/girl but it’s about seeing yourself in someone in it” Gellar said. “What’s so wonderful about what they did [with ‘Revelation’] is not only do I see myself in a lot of these female characters but I also see myself for the first time in He-Man and Skeletor. They’re much closer to characters that I think that we can understand and feel like we have something in common with. Not that I like to think I have too much in common with Skeletor.”

It was that opportunity to humanize and complicate established characters that Smith was most excited about especially since it gave him a chance to put into practice a decade’s worth of personal observations of the most successful attempt at fan service in Hollywood history: The Marvel Cinematic Universe.

“I know how to Marvel-ize this shit” Smith said. “They re-served me my childhood with fresh recipes and I get to eat the same meals that made me happy as a kid all over again. But it’s a trick. I’ve been studying Kevin Feige like crazy for 10 years. They give you something that you feel like looks like your childhood. But when you go back and compare it to your childhood it’s way better. And that’s what we did here.”

Some fans though just want their childhood again. Smith spoke with Variety weeks before “Revelation’s” debut but his sensitivity to fan reactions meant he was closely monitoring Twitter for how people were talking about the various trailers for “Revelation.” So he’d already picked up on discontent with the understanding that Teela was going to be a far more important character on his show.

“I know there’s some people that are like ‘Hey man this show’s woke'” he said. “I’m like all right great then so was the original cartoon we’re fucking sequel-izing. Go watch it again. There are girls in every episode. Deal with it.”

Never one to mince his words Smith couldn’t hide his frustration with fans taking issue with a show that at that point they hadn’t seen yet.

“It’s been interesting seeing who truly is a hardcore fan” he said. “Because anybody that’s like ‘Oh man there’s not enough He-Man’ or something like that doesn’t understand the show that we based it on. There were episodes where he lost the sword and he never became He-Man. It wasn’t like He-Man always saved the day. His friends helped him. That was the fucking point of the show.”

Now that the show has premiered there is no denying that He-Man isn’t around all that much but some of the backlash could also be a misread of the final moments of the first half of the series which hinges on a massive cliffhanger. In their quest to unify the Sword of Power to bring magic back to Eternia Teela and her friends discover Prince Adam is alive in Preternia a kind of edenic afterlife for Eternia’s fallen heroes. In a moment of selflessness knowing that he can never return to Preternia again Adam decides follow his friends back to Castle Greyskull.

But once they do and use the reunified Sword of Power to return magic to Greyskull Skeletor also emerges and literally impales Adam in the back before he can become He-Man again. Then Skeletor takes the Sword of Power raises it to the sky and becomes Skele-God a Master of the Universe — end of episode.

It could be easy to assume that Skeletor has killed Prince Adam. But he did not.

“Adam’s not dead; he’s very wounded” said Wood. “If you want to light the whole world on fire in terms of destroying a fandom you’d take He-Man out and be like ‘That’s it he’s gone bye!’ Now what they’ve done is they’ve found really interesting ways to turn the dynamics of the show on its head and raise the stakes to a point that the original never saw.”

Smith was blunter.

“I see people online go ‘Hey man they’re getting rid of He-Man!'” he said. “Like you really fucking think Mattel Television who hired me and paid me money wants to do a fucking ‘Masters of the Universe’ show without He-Man? Grow the fuck up man. Like that blew my mind bunch of people being like ‘Oh I smell it. This is a bait and switch.'”

Part 2 of “Revelation” — which will premiere likely later this year or early next year — will actually explore David’s original pitch with Prince Adam the one who has to recover from an almost debilitating blow.

“A lot of Part 2 is a world in which Skeletor has the power — then we get to say ‘Well what made Adam special?'” David said. “‘What does it mean to have the power? What made Adam the person who was most worthy to be He-Man?’ I will tell you this: Adam’s story is not done and will never be done. Not saying what happens to him but I’m just saying the stories continues.”

Wood said he has seen very rough versions of Part 2 and his face lit up when describing them. To anyone who might be upset or frustrated with the end of Part 1 he had this advice: “I would say keep keep watching with the biggest wink that an audio-only interview can give. In a world that’s filled with magic and supernatural powers anything is possible.”

Netflix (NFLX 0.43%) represents the ""N"" in the FAANG cohort of top tech companies which also include Facebook Amazon Apple and Google's parent company Alphabet.

But with a market cap of $236 billion Netflix is also much smaller than its four FAANG peers. Apple is worth more than $2 trillion Amazon and Alphabet are both worth over $1 trillion and Facebook has a market cap of $955 billion. Could Netflix also join the 12-zero club within the next ten years?

The story thus far...

Netflix has reinvented itself several times since it was founded in 1997. It initially offered DVD rentals by mail then expanded that model into a subscription service and accumulated five million members by 2006.

Netflix launched its first streaming platform in 2007 which was subsequently offered on gaming consoles set-top boxes and Blu-ray players. It also launched its service internationally.

That expansion boosted Netflix's audience to 25 million members by 2012. A year later it launched its first slate of original shows -- including Orange is the New Black House of Cards and Hemlock Grove -- to lock in its subscribers and reduce its dependence on licensed content.

Netflix hit 50 million members in 2014 100 million members in 2017 and 209.2 million members in its latest quarter. That massive audience makes it the world's largest paid video streaming platform.

Between 2010 and 2020 Netflix's annual revenue rose from $2.16 billion to $25.0 billion. Its net income surged from $161 million to $2.76 billion.

The challenges ahead...

Netflix still enjoys a first-mover's advantage in premium streaming videos but it currently faces a growing list of formidable competitors. The biggest threat is Disney (DIS 0.34%) which owns a massive portfolio of first-party content and offers its services at lower prices than Netflix.

Disney+ the company's flagship platform has already accumulated nearly 104 million subscribers since its launch in late 2019. By comparison it took Netflix's streaming platform ten years to hit 100 million subscribers. Disney expects Disney+ to reach 230 million to 260 million subscribers by the end of fiscal 2024.

Disney also owns Hulu and ESPN+ which served 41.6 million and 13.8 million subscribers respectively last quarter. Hulu hosts more mature content than Disney+ while ESPN+ streams live sports -- a frequently requested feature that Netflix still doesn't offer.

Other challengers include Amazon's Prime Video AT&T's HBO Max Apple TV+ and stand-alone streaming services from traditional TV networks. This ongoing fragmentation of the streaming market could limit Netflix's pricing power make it more difficult to gain new subscribers and force it to spend even more money on expensive original shows and movies to retain its existing audience.

Netflix has already been exploring new ways to differentiate its platform. It's licensing more anime content and expanding its children's programming and it even launched an online store to sell tie-in merchandise. It's also planning to expand into video games by offering free mobile games to subscribers.

The road to $1 trillion

Netflix's stock has rallied about 1200% over the past decade. But to cross the $1 trillion mark it needs to more than quadruple in value.

Analysts expect Netflix's revenue to rise 19% to $29.7 billion this year then grow 15% to $34.2 billion next year. Netflix's growth will likely decelerate afterwards for two simple reasons: It's saturating its developed markets like the U.S. and it faces too much competition around the world.

But let's assume Netflix continues to roll out compelling original content locks in more users with niche content like anime and expands its digital ecosystem with video games and online merchandise.

If Netflix's revenue growth meets analysts' expectations for the next two years and continues growing at an average rate of 10% from 2023 to 2030 it could generate $73.3 billion in annual revenue by the final year. If Netflix is still trading at about eight times sales it would be worth nearly $600 billion.

If Netflix grows it revenue at an average rate of 15% from 2023 to 2020 it would generate $104.6 billion in annual revenue by the final year. At eight times sales it would still fall short of the $1 trillion mark.

But Netflix's price-to-sales ratio will likely decline if investors think its high-growth days are over which would result in much lower market caps. Investors should take a look at Netflix's Chinese counterpart iQiyi which trades at just two times this year's sales and about 30% below its IPO price to see what happens when a high-growth streaming video platform loses its momentum.

The key takeaways

Netflix's growth over the past decade has been stellar but much of its success can be attributed to its first-mover's advantage in the streaming market. However that advantage will likely fade over the next decade as competitors like Disney carve up the market. Netflix should keep growing over the next decade but its chances of joining its FAANG peers in the trillion-dollar club by 2030 are slim."

The project exceeds the Company’s required internal rate of return adding profitable production from the best unmined gold deposit in West Africa.

“I am pleased to announce the approval of full funding for the Ahafo North Project expanding our existing footprint in Ghana and adding more than three million ounces of gold production over an initial 13-year mine life” said Newmont President and CEO Tom Palmer. “The development of this prolific ore body will leverage our proven operating model and will be supported by our existing world-class Ahafo South operation. The project will be developed and operated in a sustainable and responsible manner to create value for all our stakeholders.”

Located north of Newmont Ghana’s existing Ahafo South operations the Ahafo North Project will include five open pit mines and the construction of a stand-alone mill. Production from the mine will average approximately 275000 to 325000 gold ounces with projected capital costs estimated to be between $750 to $850 million. Construction is expected to be complete in the second half of 2023.

The project will create approximately 1800 jobs at the peak of construction with more than 550 permanent roles created once the mine is operational. Newmont will work to create lasting value for host communities through local sourcing and hiring. A key aspect of the Ahafo North project’s workforce planning will be a target to achieve gender parity in the workforce when operations begin.

”This is a great milestone that will enhance the Region’s reputation as one of the most strategic and important assets within the Newmont global portfolio while create shared value for our workforce community and government stakeholders through responsible and sustainable mining” said the Regional Senior Vice President for Newmont Africa Francois Hardy. “Our employees and contractors deserve recognition for their hard work as well as our community stakeholders and regulators for their collaboration in making the Region a safe sustainable and viable jurisdiction worthy of further investment.

Newmont has conducted extensive regulatory and community engagements including meeting with traditional leaders local and regional government agencies and holding public stakeholder engagement meetings. Stakeholders have endorsed the Ahafo North’s infrastructure plans and permits necessary to begin construction have been secured.

As the project proceeds Newmont will continue its robust stakeholder engagement to enhance social acceptance and provide regular updates on the project.

“I look forward to further collaboration as we transition into the next critical phase of the Project which involves stakeholder engagement resettlement and negotiations to enable access to land and subsequent commencement of project construction” Mr. Hardy concluded.

Mr. Biden’s decision this past week to name Jonathan Kanter to lead the Justice Department’s antitrust division is the latest sign of his willingness to clash with corporate America to promote more competition in the tech industry and across the economy. Mr. Kanter has spent years as a lawyer fighting behemoths like Facebook and Google on behalf of rival companies.

If confirmed by the Senate he will join Lina Khan who helped reframe the academic debate over antitrust and now leads the Federal Trade Commission and Tim Wu a longtime proponent of breaking up Facebook and other large companies who is now the special assistant to the president for technology and competition policy.

The appointments show both the Democratic Party’s renewed antitrust activism and the Biden administration’s growing concern that the concentration of power in technology as well as other industries like pharmaceuticals agriculture health care and finance has hurt consumers and workers and stunted economic growth.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiowFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2pvbmF0aGFuYnVyZ29zLzIwMjEvMDcvMjQvc2luZ2Fwb3Jlcy1wcm9wZXJ0eWd1cnUtdG8tbGlzdC12aWEtMTgtYmlsbGlvbi1kZWFsLXdpdGgtc3BhYy1iYWNrZWQtYnktYmlsbGlvbmFpcmVzLXJpY2hhcmQtbGktcGV0ZXItdGhpZWwv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Singapore's PropertyGuru To List Via $1.8 Billion Deal With SPAC Backed By Billionaires Richard Li Peter Thiel,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanburgos/2021/07/24/singapores-propertyguru-to-list-via-18-billion-deal-with-spac-backed-by-billionaires-richard-li-peter-thiel/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiowFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2pvbmF0aGFuYnVyZ29zLzIwMjEvMDcvMjQvc2luZ2Fwb3Jlcy1wcm9wZXJ0eWd1cnUtdG8tbGlzdC12aWEtMTgtYmlsbGlvbi1kZWFsLXdpdGgtc3BhYy1iYWNrZWQtYnktYmlsbGlvbmFpcmVzLXJpY2hhcmQtbGktcGV0ZXItdGhpZWwv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3hzcG9ydHMuY29tLmF1L3Rva3lvLW9seW1waWNzLTIwMjEvbm92YWstZGpva292aWMtcGhvdG8tcG9zaW5nLXdpdGgtdG9reW8tMjAyMC1neW1uYXN0cy1nb2VzLXZpcmFsL25ld3Mtc3RvcnkvMWIwZTNmZDI5NmMwYzE5MzFjZWNjODUwODk5Mzg4YzHSAZwBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm94c3BvcnRzLmNvbS5hdS90b2t5by1vbHltcGljcy0yMDIxL25vdmFrLWRqb2tvdmljLXBob3RvLXBvc2luZy13aXRoLXRva3lvLTIwMjAtZ3ltbmFzdHMtZ29lcy12aXJhbC9uZXdzLXN0b3J5LzFiMGUzZmQyOTZjMGMxOTMxY2VjYzg1MDg5OTM4OGMx?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Incredible Tokyo photo of gymnast Djoker goes viral,"Novak Djokovic is going viral after a photograph taken of him behind the scenes at the Olympics was shared to social media.

“Without the key element of any sports events the crowds the fans that energy it’s different but it is still the Olympic Games” said Djokovic.

“I was in a dilemma for a little bit but I decided to come and I’m glad because there are many more things that are beautiful about the Olympic Games. So I will try to focus on those things.”

Mr. Biden’s decision this past week to name Jonathan Kanter to lead the Justice Department’s antitrust division is the latest sign of his willingness to clash with corporate America to promote more competition in the tech industry and across the economy. Mr. Kanter has spent years as a lawyer fighting behemoths like Facebook and Google on behalf of rival companies.

If confirmed by the Senate he will join Lina Khan who helped reframe the academic debate over antitrust and now leads the Federal Trade Commission and Tim Wu a longtime proponent of breaking up Facebook and other large companies who is now the special assistant to the president for technology and competition policy.

The appointments show both the Democratic Party’s renewed antitrust activism and the Biden administration’s growing concern that the concentration of power in technology as well as other industries like pharmaceuticals agriculture health care and finance has hurt consumers and workers and stunted economic growth.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiowFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2pvbmF0aGFuYnVyZ29zLzIwMjEvMDcvMjQvc2luZ2Fwb3Jlcy1wcm9wZXJ0eWd1cnUtdG8tbGlzdC12aWEtMTgtYmlsbGlvbi1kZWFsLXdpdGgtc3BhYy1iYWNrZWQtYnktYmlsbGlvbmFpcmVzLXJpY2hhcmQtbGktcGV0ZXItdGhpZWwv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Singapore's PropertyGuru To List Via $1.8 Billion Deal With SPAC Backed By Billionaires Richard Li Peter Thiel,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanburgos/2021/07/24/singapores-propertyguru-to-list-via-18-billion-deal-with-spac-backed-by-billionaires-richard-li-peter-thiel/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiowFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2pvbmF0aGFuYnVyZ29zLzIwMjEvMDcvMjQvc2luZ2Fwb3Jlcy1wcm9wZXJ0eWd1cnUtdG8tbGlzdC12aWEtMTgtYmlsbGlvbi1kZWFsLXdpdGgtc3BhYy1iYWNrZWQtYnktYmlsbGlvbmFpcmVzLXJpY2hhcmQtbGktcGV0ZXItdGhpZWwv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3hzcG9ydHMuY29tLmF1L3Rva3lvLW9seW1waWNzLTIwMjEvbm92YWstZGpva292aWMtcGhvdG8tcG9zaW5nLXdpdGgtdG9reW8tMjAyMC1neW1uYXN0cy1nb2VzLXZpcmFsL25ld3Mtc3RvcnkvMWIwZTNmZDI5NmMwYzE5MzFjZWNjODUwODk5Mzg4YzHSAZwBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm94c3BvcnRzLmNvbS5hdS90b2t5by1vbHltcGljcy0yMDIxL25vdmFrLWRqb2tvdmljLXBob3RvLXBvc2luZy13aXRoLXRva3lvLTIwMjAtZ3ltbmFzdHMtZ29lcy12aXJhbC9uZXdzLXN0b3J5LzFiMGUzZmQyOTZjMGMxOTMxY2VjYzg1MDg5OTM4OGMx?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Incredible Tokyo photo of gymnast Djoker goes viral,"Novak Djokovic is going viral after a photograph taken of him behind the scenes at the Olympics was shared to social media.

The Serbian tennis superstar posed in an eye-watering position with the Belgian gymnastics team.

Nina Derwael shared two images of herself and Djokovic doing the splits with the caption “When Djkokovic asks for a picture you can’t refuse.”

His incredible bendiness did not go unnoticed with five-time Olympic gold medallist Nadia Comaneci tweeting the image and congratulating Djokovic on “great flexibility”.

Djokovic had cast doubt over whether he would participate because of the strict Covid-19 protocols and lack of crowds but the possibility of the Golden Slam -- winning all four majors and the Olympics -- proved impossible to resist.

“Without the key element of any sports events the crowds the fans that energy it’s different but it is still the Olympic Games” said Djokovic.

“I was in a dilemma for a little bit but I decided to come and I’m glad because there are many more things that are beautiful about the Olympic Games. So I will try to focus on those things.”

The undoubted favourite and 2008 bronze medallist is hoping to emulate Steffi Graf’s 1988 feat of winning the Golden Slam after already snapping up the Australian Open French Open and Wimbledon this year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseXRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20uYXUvY29yb25hdmlydXMvY2FsbGluZy1hbGwta2lkcy1zaG93LXVzLWxpZmUtYWZ0ZXItbG9ja2Rvd24vbmV3cy1zdG9yeS85ZGZkMzI2ZWI2MTI2MjZiNzMzMjhhMmVhMDM0N2Q4ZNIBigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseXRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20uYXUvY29yb25hdmlydXMvY2FsbGluZy1hbGwta2lkcy1zaG93LXVzLWxpZmUtYWZ0ZXItbG9ja2Rvd24vbmV3cy1zdG9yeS85ZGZkMzI2ZWI2MTI2MjZiNzMzMjhhMmVhMDM0N2Q4ZD9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Call for Aussie kids to show us life after lockdown,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/coronavirus/calling-all-kids-show-us-life-after-lockdown/news-story/9dfd326eb612626b73328a2ea0347d8d on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseXRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20uYXUvY29yb25hdmlydXMvY2FsbGluZy1hbGwta2lkcy1zaG93LXVzLWxpZmUtYWZ0ZXItbG9ja2Rvd24vbmV3cy1zdG9yeS85ZGZkMzI2ZWI2MTI2MjZiNzMzMjhhMmVhMDM0N2Q4ZNIBigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseXRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20uYXUvY29yb25hdmlydXMvY2FsbGluZy1hbGwta2lkcy1zaG93LXVzLWxpZmUtYWZ0ZXItbG9ja2Rvd24vbmV3cy1zdG9yeS85ZGZkMzI2ZWI2MTI2MjZiNzMzMjhhMmVhMDM0N2Q4ZD9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlYWxlc3RhdGUuY29tLmF1L25ld3MvMjAyMS1nb2xkLWNvYXN0LWhvdXNpbmctY29uc3RydWN0aW9uLWF3YXJkcy13aW5uZXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2021 Gold Coast Housing & Construction Awards winners - realestate.com.au,"MAJOR

According to reports Nike has filed an official complaint in a federal court in Oregon against Jeffrey Waskowiak a former Nike footwear developer and his company KickRich LLC. The legal action notes that KickRich LLC is selling “custom” sneakers that “combine purportedly genuine Nike shoe soles with uppers fabricated entirely by the defendants.” The sneaker giant continues to note that the customs sold for “hundreds or up to several thousand dollars each” feature “reproductions of Nike’s famous Swoosh design and other protected trade dress.”

Nike highlights a custom Air Jordan 1 Mid “Amazon” from KickRich which it believes creates a false affiliation with the e-commerce company. With the complaint filed in an Oregon federal court Nike is seeking monetary damages and an injunction to stop Jeffrey Waskowiak and KickRich LLC from further infringing on its trademarks or clouding its business.

Take a look at documents from Nike’s latest lawsuit below.

Much like its predecessor had Jumpman sneakers this LeBron James-produced movie features Nikes everywhere. The King even (minor spoiler alert) imprinted a Swoosh into the ground when he fell into Tune Town. This makes sense as James has a lifetime deal with Nike. Even his on-screen family had nothing but swooshes on.

As for other brands there are quick glances of Klay Thompson and Damian LIllard’s ANTA/adidas sneakers but we couldn’t identify them due to the amount of CGI on their Wet-Fire and Chronos Goon Squad characters. More than likely they are wearing their signature ANTA KT 6 and adidas Dame 6 shoes at the time they filmed their scenes.

With that said here are the notable sneakers rocked in Space Jam 2 (spoilers ahead.)

Nike LeBron 19

The most prominently worn sneaker in the film was on the feet of James himself. LeBron and Nike coordinated the unveiling of the King’s 19th signature shoe just weeks before the release of Space Jam 2. The orange and blue colorway was worn most frequently in the movie with the colors matching the bright Tune Squad jerseys in the pivotal basketball game.

Even the cartoon version of James was rocking the LeBron 19 in an all-red colorway.

James can even be seen writing the names of his fictional children on the blue “Space Jam” cartoon LeBron 19:

You can find the Nike LeBron 19 at StockX and GOAT after the shoe releases in Fall 2021.

Nike Air Max Uptempo 95

In the beginning of the film 1998 kid LeBron James is seen rocking the “Blue Fury” colorway of the Air Max Uptempo 95. This sneaker was originally worn by players big and small namely Earl Boykins and Scottie Pippen.

The Blue Fury colorway shown in the movie released in 2019 but the style is in the era that LeBron grew up in. You can find this colorway of the Air Max Uptempo 95 at StockX.

Nike Air Tech Challenge 2

Seconds later LeBron’s friend Malik walks by to let him play with the original Nintendo Game Boy. Malik walks up in the Nike Air Tech Challenge 2 a sneaker worn by tennis star Andre Agassi in 1989. Multiple retros have released in this “Hot Lava” colorway and you can find all of them at GOAT.

Nike Air Zoom Generation

Image via Product Placement Blog

LeBron’s real-life kids get new names with his eldest son switching from Bronny to Darius as played by Ceyair J. Wright. Darius’ first introduction to the movie sees him rocking LeBron’s first signature sneaker in the Air Zoom Generation. This style released in 2003 with this black “King’s Rook” colorway retroing in 2017. You can find this colorway at GOAT.

Nike Air Max 2 Light + Nike Epic React Flyknit 2

Image via Product Placement Blog

LeBron’s younger son Bryce is replaced in this movie by Dominic as played by Cedric Joe. His introduction saw him wear the multicolor Atmos x Nike Air Max 2 Light sneaker which you can find at GOAT.

LeBron himself rocks a simple pair of Nike Epic React Flyknit 2 in an Oreo black and white colorway. This can be found at Stadium Goods.

Nike Air Force 1 (Low + High)

Dom and LeBron appear on the WB Lot next and get sucked into the Serververse where both are rocking the Nike Air Force 1. King James is rocking the classic all-white colorway which you can find at Nike store.

Dom is wearing the AF1 LV8 in black opti yellow and orange peel gradient. This colorway can be found at StockX.

Al-G Rhythm even rocks the sneaker when he bulks up wearing the Air Force 1 High in purple and white (found at StockX.)

LeBron’s right-hand man Malik in the film also is wearing blue and white AF1s (seen below) that aren’t currently available.

Nike Blazer Mid

Alongside the rest of the James gang Darius is seen rocking white and yellow Nike Blazer Mids which you can find at StockX.

Nike Air Flightposite

When Dom levels up his basketball skills from the encouragement of Al-G Rhythm he upgrades his sneakers from the AF1 to the Nike Air Flightposite. This futuristic style dropped in 1999 and was notably worn by Jason Kidd and Allan Houston. This shoe isn’t new to the silver screen as it was also worn by the Green Goblin in the original Spider-Man movie from 2002.

You can find the gold and black Flightposite at StockX.

Nike LeBron 16

Diana Taurasi appears briefly as herself as well as the White Mamba on the Goon Squad. The latter had a tail so no sneakers were worn. Taurasi also appeared when Dom needed to scan hoopers for his game where she was spotted rocking a grey Nike LeBron 16.

That specific colorway isn’t available but you can find others at GOAT.

Nike Kobe AD + Nike Kobe 9 Elite

Anthony Davis is seen in the Dom motion capture seen wearing a Nike Kobe AD PE in black yellow and orange. You can find other colors at GOAT.

Later Davis shows up as his Goon Squad alter-ego “The Brow” with the eagle-man rocking the Nike Kobe 9 Elite in the blue and green “Perspective” colorway. This can be found at GOAT.

adidas N3XT L3V3L + adidas Marquee Boost Low

Everything has been Nike so far but some adidas did slip through editing for brief moments. Nneka Ogwumike is seen wearing the adidas N3XT L3V3L during the Dom scan scene. You can find this shoe at StockX.

Her Goon Squad alter ego Arachnneka is later seen wearing the adidas Marquee Boost Low which can be bought at StockX.

Nike Dunk Low

At the end of the film Dom gets his wish with LeBron allowing him to go to Game Design Camp. The young James walks off in the Nike Dunk Low in green and yellow. This Doernbecher charity colorway can be found at GOAT.

Nike Air Fear of God 1

The craziest moment in Space Jam 2 was when “Michael Jordan” showed up to help the Tune Squad. Of course it wasn’t THE Michael Jordan and any sneakerhead could tell as this man walked in with the Nike Fear of God 1 instead of a Jumpman shoe.

You can find Michael B. Jordan’s black and white Nike Air FOG 1 at StockX.

Air Jordan 1 x Travis Scott

After the credits roll you can see members of the Tune Squad in the real world interacting with athletes and celebrities. After Porky Pig dropped bars earlier in the film you can see him on stage with Travis Scott whose rocking his brown Air Jordan 1 collab. You can find this Mocha sneaker at GOAT.

His very public flirtation with rival Nike is becoming more frequent as the first thing you see in a commercial for his new album Donda is a pair of Nike sneakers.

The one-minute trailer premiered during the NBA Finals and stars Sha’Carri Richardson the U.S. runner who was left of the Olympic Team after a positive marijuana test. As the new song “No Child Left Behind” plays the spot opens with her Nike sneakers on starting blocks. Until halfway through when you see Beats headphones in her ears you could easily believe it’s an advertisement for the Swoosh.

Richardson is signed with Nike and the company has stuck with her throughout the marijuana controversy after she qualified for the Olympics. But you’d still expect West who reportedly earned $191 million from Adidas last year to be more careful about showcasing his business partner’s biggest competitor.

Here we go again — Earlier this month West was spotted wearing Nike socks with his Adidas Yeezy Foam Runners at Balenciaga’s Haute Couture show — considered a no-no in cross-branding by many sneakerheads and made worse by his allegiances to Adidas.

West wasn’t shy about complaining about the way Nike treated him when he decamped for Adidas but his behavior in the last year has shown he still can’t get over his ex. In an interview with Nick Cannon last September he said his Adidas contract should still allow him to wear Air Jordans.

“Jordans need to be part of reparations” West said. “You can’t tell a Black man not to wear Jordans. It should be in any deal. And also you can wear your friend’s clothes.”

As he alluded Virgil Abloh and Ibn Jasper two longtime friends of West have frequently collaborated with Nike. So two has Matthew Williams an early creative partner of Kanye West who went on to found Alyx and become creative director of Givenchy.

Supporting the homies is one thing but how about not biting the hand that helped make you a billionaire? Adidas has yet to comment on any of West’s flirtations with Nike and perhaps it’s begrudgingly accepted that Kanye is going to Kanye."

Early in Round 3 of the 3M Open much of the moving Keith Mitchell did was walking in birdie putts right to the hole.

Again and again and again.

Mitchell tied a Tour record by starting his round with seven consecutive birdies a stretch that was part ball-striking (he hit every green in regulation) and part dead-eye putting (three over 10 feet including a 30-foot bomb on his second hole).

The path toward shooting a 59 — heck maybe lower — was definitely laid out.

""Oh absolutely"" Mitchell said. ""It was like 'If I keep swinging like this and executing like this we're going to have a chance.'

""I actually felt some nerves a little bit"" he continued. ""But they were good nerves. Not like the 'hope I don't miss the cup' nerves or 'where do we stand on the FedExCup?' nerves. It's more of like 'Hey I'm in contention again and I want to play well' nerves and those are the good kind those are the fun kind.""

Just as quickly as Mitchell's scores bumped him up the leaderboard — at one point he held the lead alone at 11 under — he fell back to the pack.

Mitchell's birdie run ended when he missed a 22-footer by 18 inches on the par-3 17th. He two-putted for par on the par-5 18th then made bogeys on Nos. 1 and 3. Six consecutive pars followed and he signed for a 6-under 66. He'll begin the final round four shots behind the leader.

""I feel like it's two completely different rounds"" he said. ""I couldn't miss on the first seven holes and all I was trying to do was just give myself opportunities on the back nine and it just wasn't happening.""

If at first you don't succeed ...

Gary Woodland will start Sunday at 11 under one shot back of the lead. Six strokes into Saturday that looked like quite the long shot.

Woodland misjudged his second shot from the first cut of rough and wound up in a greenside bunker. With little green to work with he again endured a mishit and flew the green leaving him more than double the distance away from the cup. It led to a double bogey.

He trudged to the second hole with the first out of sight and out of mind.

Woodland birdied five of the next six and added one more at No. 16. More important he made no further bogeys to cap off a 4-under 67.

""I had a lot of confidence with a good warmup so that's what I told myself on No. 2"" Woodland said. ""And I hit a great drive on No. 2 and really got momentum going and played solid all day.""

Just win baby?

At 115th in the standings Pat Perez at the moment has enough FedEx Cup points to earn an invitation to the PGA Tour playoffs kickoff event The Northern Trust in four weeks. And Saturday's 5-under 66 put him into a tie for fourth place in Blaine and in prime position to gain even more of a points cushion.

And if he doesn't there's one heck of a consolation prize.

Perez and his wife Ashley are close to welcoming their second child. How close?

""Scheduled Thursday of the first playoff [event]"" Perez said. ""So I'm kind of in a Catch-22. If I don't play well then I'm going to be home for the birth. If I play well I kind of have to miss it I think. It's kind of a weird deal ... but we are very excited for the boy to come.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vbmV3cy91ay1ub3J0aGVybi1pcmVsYW5kLTU3OTY0NjAz0gE5aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmJjLmNvbS9uZXdzL3VrLW5vcnRoZXJuLWlyZWxhbmQtNTc5NjQ2MDMuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Covid-19: Health trusts in appeal to off-duty staff,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL25ld3Muc2t5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS9jb3ZpZC0xOS1leHRyYS1udXJzZXMtY2FsbGVkLWluLXRvLWJlbGZhc3QtaG9zcGl0YWxzLXRvLWRlYWwtd2l0aC1leHRyZW1lLXByZXNzdXJlLWZyb20tcGF0aWVudHMtMTIzNjQwNjXSAYgBaHR0cHM6Ly9uZXdzLnNreS5jb20vc3RvcnkvYW1wL2NvdmlkLTE5LWV4dHJhLW51cnNlcy1jYWxsZWQtaW4tdG8tYmVsZmFzdC1ob3NwaXRhbHMtdG8tZGVhbC13aXRoLWV4dHJlbWUtcHJlc3N1cmUtZnJvbS1wYXRpZW50cy0xMjM2NDA2NQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,COVID-19: Extra nurses called in to Belfast hospitals to deal with 'extreme pressure' from patients,"Hospitals in Belfast have called in extra nurses to deal with the ""extreme pressure"" from increasing numbers of COVID-19 patients as Northern Ireland runs out of hospital beds.

The Belfast Trust which runs the Northern Irish capital's hospitals said the Royal Victoria Hospital and the Mater Hospital were both struggling to cope.

In a tweet appeal it said: ""We are under extreme pressure in the RVH & Mater as we care for an increasing number of Covid19+ patients alongside emergency admissions.

""We are asking for help from our Trust nursing staff to work tonight & overnight & ask those available to work tonight to ring 07825 140 173.""

The call came in a day after hundreds of anti-mask and vaccine passport protesters gathered in Belfast city centre.

On Friday the health trust said it was postponing elective orthopaedic surgery ""due to the significant pressures"" caused in part by COVID-19 admissions.

It said the trust's three acute hospitals had 71 COVID-19 inpatients on Friday and were experiencing ""significant bed pressures"" due to ""an unprecedented number of patients attending through our emergency departments"".

Northern Ireland has seen a spike in coronavirus cases in the past 10 days after gradually increasing since mid-June.

More people are also now being admitted to hospital with the virus.

There are now more hospital beds occupied in Northern Ireland than are usually available with hospitals having to set up extra beds to accommodate both COVID and non-COVID patients.

A total of 163 inpatients have COVID-19 across the country as of Sunday and there are currently 52 outbreaks at care homes.

In an appeal on Facebook the trust said the hospitals are caring for an increasing number of positive Covid-19 patients alongside emergency admissions.

The South Eastern Trust also appealed for staff to work on Sunday evening due to ongoing pressures.

It comes after the Department of Health recorded another two deaths linked to Covid-19 on Sunday.

Northern Ireland’s death toll now stands at 2170.

Another 1264 positive cases were recorded representing a small drop on Saturday’s figure but still 537 more cases than the previous Sunday’s figure.

“We are asking for help from you our trust nursing staff to work this evening and overnight” stated the trust in its appeal.

“We would ask anyone who is available to work tonight to make contact with us on 07825 140173.”

Health Minister Robin Swann said the appeals were necessary to maintain services.

“My enduring thanks to all our health staff who do so much for all of us” he added. “Play your part follow the regulations and get your vaccine.”

Sinn Fein MLA Colm Gildernew called on Mr Swann to ensure safe staffing levels in hospitals and described the staff appeals as “very concerning”.

""The Health Minister must act to ensure safe staffing levels in all hospitals and that all staff are supported” he stated.

""It is also important that everyone continues to be vigilant and follow the public health guidelines to help ease pressures on our health service and its workers.""

DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and the party’s health spokesperson Pam Cameron said the increasing pressure on the health service demonstrates the need for young people to ensure they take up the offer of Covid vaccination.

“Numbers of people hospitalised through Covid-19 have been increasing over recent days and this will have an impact on other health services” they said in a statement.

""Due to these pressures there will be a downturn in elective care in the Belfast Trust from Monday. There has also been a call put out to off-duty nursing staff to work this evening because of pressures at the Royal and Mater hospitals.

""Across the UK there has been an increase in the numbers of younger people contracting Covid-19. Whilst we have hit another significant milestone locally with over one million people now fully vaccinated we lag behind other areas of the UK in terms of our younger population.

""In Scotland around 30% of under 30s are not yet vaccinated whilst in England that figure rises to 34%. In Northern Ireland however that figure rises to just over 42%.

Ezekiel (Zeek) Raui is a name to remember because if everything goes to plan he will become Prime Minister one day.

With his latest award the 23-year old social entrepreneur from the Far North is perhaps one step closer to his goal.

Last week the Young Enterprise Trust celebrated its alumni and the achievements of an estimated 100000 students who have completed the programme – including Raui who was named Cultural Leader of the Year and Supreme Alumni of the Year.

He was also a runner-up for Contributor of the Year.

""I didn't know I was nominated. Someone did it anonymously so it was a nice surprise when I found out"" Raui said.

This was the first time the Alumni Awards had been celebrated as its own event.

Jessikah Cresswell alumni programme manager at Young Enterprise said the evening was a great success and celebrated the passion and talent of New Zealand's leading young entrepreneurs.

Raui took part in the Young Enterprise scheme while at Taipa Area School and developed a mental health programme for youth after witnessing alcohol and drug abuse as well as suicide among his peers.

With the support and guidance of mental health advocates Mike King and Dr Lance O'Sullivan Raui later launched TūKotahi – a peer-support programme led by young people.

Raui said the concept was to help young people in rural places to develop strong mental health strategies and foster youth participation and leadership.

The young man's work has since gathered so much momentum that Raui admits: ""I ticked a few things off my bucket list early"".

Besides his long list of volunteer involvements Raui met the Queen in 2017 when he received the Queen's Young Leaders 2017 Award in Buckingham Palace.

In 2015 he took part in the first White House United National Indian Tribal Youth conference where he met then-President Barack Obama.

He was also chosen to meet the Duke and Duchess of Sussex - Prince Harry and Megan - during their New Zealand tour in 2018

Raui also appeared on the Forbes Asia 30 Under 30 list of most influential social entrepreneurs and has since completed a Bachelor's degree in business and commerce.

He is now doing a Master's degree in business management while also working full-time.

Raui said although he is keeping busy at the moment his end goal would be to become Prime Minister of New Zealand."

The USAF is determined to replace its fleet of RQ-4 Global Hawk drones deemed obsolete by the service in view of emerging threats from adversaries such as China.

Testifying before the Senate Appropriations Committee Lt. Gen. David S. Nahom US Air Force Deputy Chief of staff for plans and programs said that the successor of the RQ-4 Global Hawk is expected to be inducted into the USAF service by the end of this decade.

Lt. Gen. Nahom said that the existing Global Hawk fleet is inadequate against modern air defenses and its replacements are on the way reported Air Force Magazine.

At “the speeds it flies the altitudes it flies and the makeup of the aircraft it’s just not survivable in these contested environments that we’re going to be looking to gather intelligence from in the future” the top Air Force official said referring to Block 40 Global Hawk.

However it is said that E-8 Joint STARS and the Global Hawk will be used to meet the Ground Moving Target Indicator mission. Nahom also reiterated that the Global Hawks will be extremely significant in the coming six to eight years while the USAF decides about their replacement.

He also admitted that the threat has accelerated much more in the past few years. Also present at the Committee meeting Senator Richard Shelby pointed out that China’s strong economic base makes the Asian country a much bigger threat than the Soviet Union ever was during the Cold War.

Similar concerns were voiced by Air Force General Charles Brown earlier this year when he stated that many legacy intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance platforms are found to be unable to deliver “needed capabilities on competition-relevant timelines”.

It was recommended that such platforms be phased out and resources be invested in modern and relevant systems.

The Global Hawk Drones

Developed by Northrop Grumman the RQ-4 Global Hawk is a high-altitude long-endurance remotely piloted aircraft. Equipped with an integrated sensor suite it can conduct intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) missions during day or night and in all-weather conditions.

According to the USAF the Global Hawk provides a broad spectrum of ISR collection capability to help the combatant forces in various peacetime contingency and wartime operations.

The aircraft is 14.5m in length is 4.7 m high and has a wingspan of 39.8 m. The speed of the aircraft is 357 mph and the average range is 12300 nautical miles. It has been in operation with the USAF since 2001 and has more than 250000 flight hours in missions supporting military operations in Iraq Afghanistan North Africa and the Asia-Pacific region.

As the USAF seeks to replace it the two likely contenders to the Global Hawk seem to be Lockheed Martin’s TR-X and Northrop Grumman’s RQ-180

Lockheed Martin TR-X

US defense giant Lockheed Martin believes its new TR-X will be a capable replacement for the USAF’s Global Hawk as well as U-2. The “high-flying hard-to-see drone” is expected to incorporate the designs of both the U-2 and the Global Hawk reported Popular Mechanics.

The TR-X is expected to operate in ISR missions at altitudes of about 70000 feet. According to reports the aircraft may have stealth features of the other Lockheed designs such as the F-22 and F-35 aircraft.

It is expected to have “swept-back wing mainplanes outward cranked tail fins and a dorsal intake set aft of the nose”. Mission equipment is expected to be located internally with a built-in modular payload capability.

It would be 16 m long 4.50 m high and have a wingspan of 21 m. equipped with a General Electric F 118 Turbofan engine to provide an estimated 20000 lb of thrust. Currently under development the TR-X is expected to enter service by 2025.

In 2016 Lockheed had proposed a 10-year program to deliver 30 aircraft. Explaining the similarities with the Global Hawk Lockheed Martin’s U-2 business development manager Scott Winstead said that the aircraft will have the “same 130-foot wingspan as the Global hawk to prevent basing issues with existing hangars”.

Winstead further mentioned that the TR-X will have a newly designed straight wing which will be complemented by low-observable (LO) shaping. The LO and the electronic countermeasures will provide adequate defense against detection by surface-to-air missile systems.

The Northrop Grumman RQ-180

Another contender to replace the Global Hawk is the Northrop Grumman RQ-180 stealth unmanned aerial vehicle. The RQ-180 has its design motivated by advanced broadband all-aspect very low-observable (stealth) requirements reported The Drive.

The RQ-180 can operate as a networking and reconnaissance platform which can fly deep into enemy airspace. Flying as high as 70000 feet the RQ-180 is expected to outpace fighters and drones in enemy airspace and be capable of gathering line-of-sight data from the F-35 and B-21 Multi-function Advanced Data Link (MADL) systems and F-22’s stealthy Infra-Flight Data Link (IFDL).

The stealth reconnaissance drone RQ-180 has been operational since 2017 The National Interest had reported. Though the USAF never officially acknowledged the fact it is believed that the RQ-180 had been based in Guam to support the radar-evading drone in the Pacific region. It is believed that the USAF had tested the RQ-180 at Groom Lake in Nevada near the Area 51 complex. Missing In Action – Why Indian Navy Has Been ‘Shying-Away’ From Using Its Aircraft Carriers In Major Conflicts?

The RQ-180 has extensive stealth features such as a unique body shape and coatings to avoid detection by enemy radars. It is based on the same form and function as that of the Lockheed RQ-170 Sentinel though it has a more enhanced endurance envelope.

It is 40 m long 10 m high and has a wingspan of 50 m. It is equipped with one turbofan engine and has a ceiling of 12200 m and a range of 3900 km. The drone will be equipped with mission-specific payloads related to its intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance missions.

Many experts believe that the RQ-180 has a striking resemblance to another Northrop Grumman manufactured product the B-2 and the B-21 Raider Bomber.

Last year The EurAsian Times had also reported that the RQ-180 was photographed by actor Rob Kolinsky when the stealth spy drone flew over his house. In an Instagram post he mentioned a similarity with the B-21 and stated “this thing flew over my house several weeks ago and I still have yet to identify it”.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL2FybXlyZWNvZ25pdGlvbi5jb20vbmV3cy9hcm15LW5ld3MvMjAyMS91cy1hcm15LWF3YXJkcy1jb250cmFjdC10by1iYWUtc3lzdGVtcy1mb3Itb3B0aW9uYWxseS1tYW5uZWQtZmlnaHRpbmctdmVoaWNsZS1vbWZ2LXByb2dyYW3SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US Army awards contract to BAE Systems for Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle OMFV program,"According to information released on July 23 2021 The U.S. Army has awarded BAE Systems a contract for the concept development phase of the Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle (OMFV) program.

During this phase BAE Systems will further develop a design that will meet - with ample growth and adaptability - the Army’s needs for lethality mobility and survivability on future battlefields.



BAE Systems along with teammate Elbit Systems of America will explore crew automation active protection and other transformational combat vehicle technologies and turret solutions that will deliver the advanced warfighting capabilities the Army needs for the future.



BAE Systems’ OMFV design will provide a highly maneuverable and survivable solution for the Army’s Armored Brigade Combat Team (ABCT) to engage in close combat and deliver decisive lethality. BAE Systems’ solution will accommodate a host of targeting systems that will share threat and target data across the ABCT team and will help protect soldiers as they get to the fight.



BAE Systems’ OMFV concept is an integrated system of systems based on a Modular Open Systems Approach (MOSA) which allows for rapid upgrades and technology refresh for quick insertion of new innovations or to counter emerging threats. MOSA solutions also help lower lifecycle sustainment costs and enable commonality across platforms.



In June 2018 in part due to congressional concerns the Army announced a new modernization strategy and designated the Next Generation Combat Vehicle (NGCV) as the program to replace the M-2 Bradley. In October 2018 Army leadership decided to redesignate the NGCV as the Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle (OMFV) and to add additional vehicle programs to what would be called the NGCV Program.



The M-2 Bradley IFV (Infantry Fighting Vehicle)  which has been in service since 1981 is an Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV) used to transport infantry on the battlefield and provide fire support to dismounted troops and suppress or destroy enemy fighting vehicles. Updated numerous times since its introduction the M-2 Bradley is widely considered to have reached the technological limits of its capacity to accommodate new electronics armor and defense systems.



According to U.S. congress report BAE Systems had proposed its fifth-generation CV-90. The CV-90 was first fielded in Europe in the 1990s. The latest version mounted a 35 mm cannon provided by Northrop Grumman that can accommodate 50 mm munitions. The CV-90 featured the Israeli IMI Systems Iron Fist Active Protection System (APS). The CV-90 could accommodate a three-person crew and five infantry soldiers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdmFsbmV3cy5jb20vZXZlbnQtbmV3cy9zZWEtYWlyLXNwYWNlLTIwMjEvMjAyMS8wNy91LXMtbmF2eS1taWdodC1oYXZlLXVjYXZzLWpvaW5pbmctdGhlLWZsZWV0LWluLWEtZmV3LXllYXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,U.S. Navy Might Have UCAVs Joining the Fleet in a Few Years,"U.S. Navy Might Have UCAVs Joining the Fleet in a Few Years The Boeing MQ-25A “Stingray” is being built as an unmanned tanker to fly off aircraft carriers and refuel US Navy and US Marine Corps jets but will the US Navy create an Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicle (UCAV) as originally planned ?

Naval News asked the U.S. Navy at Sea Air Space 2021’s virtual prequel and Admiral Jonathan Greenert 30th Chief of Naval Operations replied.

Admiral Greenert said on July 20 2021 “The simple answer is`Yes there is a plan to take what has now evolved to the MQ-25A “Stingray”…it is in the budget to be produced as a tanker [by] 2023.’

“The whole concept is let’s get it going; let’s get it operating from a carrier get the hard part over: Control of it integrate it into the air wing take it from the hangar up to the deck off to the [refueling] mission come back [and] rotate it through. Then what we want to do is figure out what payloads go on there and what missions they can portend. How can we extend the range of this thing? What can we do with it? Can we use it for strike missions? Certainly we can use it for ISR [Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance]. The CNO [Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Michael M.Gilday] wants to get that as soon as possible. If you want years I’d say three years from IOC [Initial Operating Capability] of a tanker. In his mind [CNO’s] he wants to see this thing doing multiple missions in extending the eyes and ears of the Strike Group and then you get to the point where it’s unmanned—you’re still controlling it—it’s autonomous and is it reasonable and needed to integrate strike into it?”

10 June 2010. The DARPA/U.S. Air Force X-45A Unmanned Combat Air Vehicle (UCAV) system demonstration program completed the first phase of demonstrations known as Block I on Feb. 28 2003. The final Block I activities included two flights at Dryden during which safe operation of the weapons bay door was verified at 35000 feet and speeds of Mach 0.75 the maximum planned altitude and speed for the two X-45A demonstrator vehicles.

For speculative analysis discussion purposes the U.S. Navy made no mention as to the UCAV manufacturer and designation to acquire such as the Boeing X-45 Boeing MQ-25A “Stingray” Boeing “Phantom Ray” Northrop Grumman X-47B and the Kratos XQ-58A “Valkyrie” UCAV prototype designs that have been test-flown even though the MQ-25A has been selected as an unarmed UAV tanker.

Range speed stealth payload autonomy combat power deterrence and other important factors will determine the type model and manufacturer of the U.S. Navy’s UCAV during the acquisition process. The U.S. Navy has yet to fully discuss and expand on the premise of how a fielded UCAV can alter modernize and transform the naval fleet with new ships capabilities benefits programs and tactics and strategies such as the proposed Drone Carrier Warship concept and Distributed Maritime Operations Distributed Lethality Project Overmatch and Joint All-Domain Command and Control (JADC2).

While the notion of a UCAV is still premature for 2021 (the MQ-25A unmanned tanker comes first) perhaps in the following years the U.S. Navy will solidify their plans as to how an in-service UCAV can aid in future fleet tactics strategies and air wing composition.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndhbmUuY29tL25ld3MvZi0xMTctbmlnaHRoYXdrcy1waG90b2dyYXBoZWQtaGVhZGluZy10b3dhcmQtYXJlYS01MS_SAVhodHRwczovL3d3dy53YW5lLmNvbS9kb250LW1pc3MvZi0xMTctbmlnaHRoYXdrcy1waG90b2dyYXBoZWQtaGVhZGluZy10b3dhcmQtYXJlYS01MS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,F-117 Nighthawks photographed heading toward Area 51,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://www.wane.com/news/f-117-nighthawks-photographed-heading-toward-area-51/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndhbmUuY29tL25ld3MvZi0xMTctbmlnaHRoYXdrcy1waG90b2dyYXBoZWQtaGVhZGluZy10b3dhcmQtYXJlYS01MS_SAVhodHRwczovL3d3dy53YW5lLmNvbS9kb250LW1pc3MvZi0xMTctbmlnaHRoYXdrcy1waG90b2dyYXBoZWQtaGVhZGluZy10b3dhcmQtYXJlYS01MS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,

You Might Notice Some New Features in Port,"Alaskans aren't ones to sit idly by. While the 2020 cruise season to the state never happened as a result of the global health pandemic residents and port officials have been continuing on (as best as possible) with a host of new infrastructure upgrades.

Cruise Critic returned to Alaska for the first time in 21 months aboard Royal Caribbean's Serenade of the Seas on its inaugural July 19 voyage. Since then other lines -- including Celebrity Holland America Line and Princess -- have also restarted cruise operations to be followed by others.

While it was wonderful to be back on Alaskan soil once again we were surprised -- pleasantly so -- to find many ports had been quite busy during the past year. New docks cruise terminals shops and other facilities have been added to numerous ports of call all of which are likely to surprise -- and delight -- returning cruisers to the Last Frontier.

For the most part these huge investments are projects that were approved prior to the start of the global health pandemic and are only now just seeing passengers for the first time.

Based on our voyage aboard Serenade of the Seas here's what cruisers can expect to see in some of Alaska's marquee ports of call.

The cruise port owned and operated by a majority of folks from the nearby Tlingit village of Hoonah has come a long way since Celebrity Mercury became the first vessel to inaugurate the manufactured port of call in 2004.

Those who arrived early in Icy Strait Point's existence might be surprised to see the sheer number of changes being made to this increasingly popular port of call.

Take the new high-speed Transporter Gondola that now links the existing cruise berth arrivals landing (known locally as Adventure Landing) with the new Wilderness Landing and cruise berth that have been constructed for Norwegian Cruise Line.

The Gondola was designed to create an entirely vehicle-free zone in Icy Strait Point while still transporting up to 5600 guests per hour between the two landings.

The ride -- a scenic zip through the surrounding rainforest -- lasts about three minutes and will cost $15 for unlimited use. It will also be complimentary for those purchasing shore excursions including rides on Icy Strait Point's Ziprider the longest in the world at 5330 feet with 1330 feet of elevation.

Of course you can also walk between the two terminals which are located about a mile apart from each other.

Another high-speed Gondola is still under construction. The Mountain Top gondola will whisk passengers up to the Ziprider eliminating the need for a long bus ride around to the other side of the island. It is scheduled to open in October.

Those arriving at Icy Strait Point aboard Norwegian Encore which sets out on its debut voyage August 7 will immediately begin using the new Wilderness Landing dock. Other vessels will primarily use the Adventure Landing dock that has been at Icy Strait Point since 2016.

Like Icy Strait Point Sitka used to be a tender-only port. Ships would anchor out in Sitka Sound and tender passengers into the heart of the city next to the Centennial building.

With vessels increasing in size tendering was becoming a cumbersome ordeal that limited time in port. The Old Sitka Dock (now referred to as Halibut Point) is located 7 miles north of downtown Sitka and was constructed in 2012 to handle one vessel.

This past winter Halibut Point Marine Services expanded that dock adding new floating bollards and pilings at the end of the pier that will now allow two large-scale cruise ships to come alongside at one time.

To handle those extra passengers Halibut Point Marine Services constructed a brand-new cruise terminal that takes the place of the former utilitarian building that housed a small collection of vendors and some amenities.

The new building -- which was in the late-stages of construction during our late July 2021 visit -- will eventually include a taproom offering brews from upstart Harbor Mountain Brewing Company which made its debut during the middle of the pandemic taking over from Baranof Island Brewing Company which folded in 2019.

The two-level cruise terminal at Halibut Point makes the area feel more purpose-built rather than its former incarnation which always felt like an unused pier in an industrial area of town. It's a great first impression for passengers looking to come ashore and explore the gracious ""first capital city"" of Alaska.

Passengers coming ashore in Ketchikan aren't likely to notice much in the way of new developments -- unless they are arriving onboard one of Norwegian Cruise Line's ships.

For many years now Ketchikan has had four cruise berths that line the waterfront in a sort of inverted J-shape. Berth 1 is directly across from Salmon Landing and its shops while Berth 4 is a bit of a hike into town but still doable.

But new developments are coming as Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings will inaugurate its new terminal located outside of Ketchikan this year at Ward Cove.

Known as The Mill at Ward Cove this new two-pier development will be primarily used by NCLH vessels which will have priority berthing there. Built at the site of the former Ketchikan Pulp Mill 7 miles to the north of the city the facility isn't entirely complete -- but plans for it are sweeping including a recreation of the Tongass National Forest indoors a museum on the history of the Pulp Mill which closed in 1997 and even refurbished rail cars purchased from Canada to show passengers how pulp was transported further afar.

The facility is designed to relieve pressure on Ketchikan's existing dock infrastructure and to spread arriving passengers out more. It hasn't been without controversy -- residents worry some passengers docking in Ward Cove will never bother to take the 17-minute ride into town and that coaches will clog the narrow two-lane road linking the two locales -- but it represents the largest new development for cruise in the region in over a decade.

If all goes well Norwegian Encore will inaugurate the new facility when it arrives for the first time August 12.

Aside from Ward Cove the most pleasant change all passengers are likely to find in Ketchikan is an absence of the crushing throngs of people that used to make a stroll along Creek Street the city's historic former Red Light district tricky.

Passengers coming ashore in Juneau will notice things are much as they have always been in the capital city with ships tying up at four berths lining the inner waterfront off the Gastineau Channel.

The Alaska Steamship Dock (Dock E) is always prized by passengers for being right next to the town Library and parking structure. The AJ dock -- the last in the line -- is less so thanks to its southerly location that requires a short bus ride into town or a pleasant 15-minute stroll if the weather cooperates.

What passengers might notice however is that a few things have changed for popular attractions and businesses in the last year or so.

Alaskan Brewing Company has a new taproom located out of the downtown area. While the Franklin Street retail location is still open for visitors and every bar in town serves the brewery's popular Alaskan Amber its brewery tours are suspended for now due to COVID-related restrictions.

Passengers cans still visit the taproom by booking the Alaskan Ales and Whales excursion available from most cruise lines or cab it out to the remote spot near the town's Costco. Fair warning: Taxis in Juneau are not cheap. Best to grab a group of friends and split the cost.

A good reason for going besides the beers: the Wild Alaskan food truck. This unassuming bright orange food truck can usually be found in the Alaskan Brewing Company's parking lot and serves up the best halibut and chips we've ever tasted. Just don't tell anyone else OK? Let's keep this between us.

The tasting room is closed Mondays so check your cruise line schedule before hopping a taxi out there.

Other notable changes in Juneau include more shops located in the blue Merchants Wharf building (where the popular Hangar restaurant and pub can be found) and more outdoor seating at popular venues like Tracy's Crab Shack added as a result of the pandemic.

Word on the street is a new taproom could open on the waterfront in the old Tracy's Crab Shack location before the end of the season.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Pumped to join my new team @lolnrg and start tearing down turrets! Get ready for the Shaq attack! #leagueoflegends pic.twitter.com/cWtl8Zhua1 — SHAQ (@SHAQ) March 17 2016

According to Bitcoin Pro nedir. the only previous notable eSports investor from the traditional sports world was former Lakers forward Rick Fox who owns a League of Legends team and has been a public proponent of eSports himself. Andy Miller the chairman of NRG said the latest investment will help further legitimize eSports with the traditional sports world.

“We think they will help legitimize the space” NRG’s chairman Andy Miller tells the Daily Dot. “They all come from the traditional sports world. They were all unbelievably young when they became professionals like our guys.”

It’s an excellent point. People turned off by eSports could change their mind when they see All-Star traditional athletes take interest. As the Daily Dot notes Rollins himself is a League of Legends player and Shaq has connected to eSports through his relationship with Turner Sports who announced a new Counter Strike: Go competition ELEAGUE last year.

Miller said O’Neal will bring great energy to the teams and sound excited to have him.

“[Shaq] has been circling the space and during CES he kind of fell in love with it and he said “I’m all in let’s do it’” says Miller. “He’s the world’s biggest kid and he’ll bring an epic amount of fun and energy—no pun intended—to our teams and to the space in general.”

Traditional sports fans may scoff at the idea of eSports being a legitimate entertainment product but we are past that point now as it’s already huge. eSports is coming and there’s nothing you can do to stop it – even athletes realize this – so you might as well jump on the bandwagon.

Although building a PC yourself can usually net you hundreds of dollars in savings a continued rise in the cost of components makes it nearly impossible to put together a machine at a reasonable price. And the main reason why is the ongoing GPU shortage.

Rising prices aren’t anything new for PC components. GPU prices ebb and flow with demand and RAM prices rock up and down like a roller coaster and those two components alone can represent a significant portion of your build price.

This time is different though. A perfect storm of constrained supply overwhelming demand and market expansion would lock buyers out of finding a graphics card for more than a year. And although things are getting better the problem is far from over.

To understand how we got here here’s a history of the GPU shortage.

A dose of context

Before getting into the GPU shortage that’s currently going on it’s important to look back. This isn’t a new problem for the GPU market. The difference today isn’t the shortage but the fact that various factors have extended and worsened it.

The market experienced a similar shortage in 2017 with Nvidia’s GTX 10 series and AMD’s RX 500 series graphics cards. The shortage stemmed from increased demand due to rising Ethereum prices which is an alternative to Bitcoin that is still contributing to the shortage today.

Graphics cards are especially vulnerable to shortages and price volatility compared to many other PC components.

Similarly the Asia-Pacific region saw a shortage of GTX 980 and GTX 980 Ti graphics cards in 2015. The main culprit at the time was an issue with GPU supply chains which was furthered by increased demand in the region. Prices rose about 15% in parts of the world though they quickly returned to normal.

Graphics cards are especially vulnerable to shortages and price volatility compared to many other PC components. The two main GPU companies Nvidia and AMD don’t actually manufacture that many graphics cards. Instead they provide the designs that add-in board partners (AIBs) license to build and sell their own versions.

This model does a lot of good including offering users various card options for different types of computers. You could for example choose a liquid-cooled card for a high-end gaming PC or a slimmed-down card that doesn’t require external power for a stealthy build.

It carries some issues however. Nvidia and AMD are free to set a target price for their graphics cards but the final price depends on how much components logistics and taxes cost for AIBs. That makes the target price largely irrelevant especially when the cost of components is high. This is important to keep in mind when looking at the GPU shortage happening today.

The few first-party cards that AMD and Nvidia make sell out immediately after launch. AIB cards come in after the fact and normalize supply as well as provide more options to the market.

Given the past several launches a GPU shortage was inevitable. The difference this time was that the PC gaming market was growing at an alarming rate and a pandemic was about to shut people inside for over a year.

It’s a pandemic

On March 11 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) officially classified the coronavirus as a pandemic. California implemented the first mandatory stay-at-home order on March 19 and by May 31 73% of U.S. counties had a stay-at-home order in place.

With an exodus from the office the demand for computers grew. In 2020 the PC market grew by 13.1% which is the largest growth the market had seen since 2010 when it grew by 13.7%.

Ryan Reith an employee at market research firm IDC said that the “growth centered around work from home and remote learning needs.” Reflecting on the boom Reith said “the pandemic not only fueled PC market demand but also created opportunities that resulted in a market expansion.”

At the same time the semiconductor industry started having some problems. Semiconductors are the building blocks of most modern electronics. In short they can conduct manageable current through an electronic circuit which is useful for everything from building a digital alarm clock to building a graphics card.

Semiconductor companies require long lead times so companies like AMD and Nvidia usually request a certain allocation of manufacturing capacity months or even years in advance. The pandemic as well as the rise in demand for computers threw this delicate system out of balance.

In 2020 the PC market grew by 13.1% which is the largest growth the market had seen since 2010 when it grew by 13.7%.

Decreased demand for cars in early 2020 caused many automakers to reduce their order size only to try and increase their order size when the car market rebounded later in the year. Meanwhile demand for Bluetooth and Wi-Fi chips skyrocketed all while the tools essential for creating them decreased in supply.

Those are only two examples of issues the semiconductor industry faced in 2020. The important thing to remember for the GPU shortage is that semiconductor companies were operating at full capacity all while the pandemic disrupted supply chains and grew the entire computing market.

Ampere arrives … for some

Nvidia launched the RTX 3080 on September 17 2020 kicking off the Ampere range and the GPU shortage. Unsurprisingly the cards sold out immediately only to be marked up by secondhand sellers. That’s not out of the ordinary for the graphics card market.

At the time short-term shortages were blamed on increased demand. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said that “the 3080 and 3090 have a demand issue not a supply issue” during a press event at the company’s GPU Technology Conference. Huang said that there wasn’t “a real problem to solve” chalking the issue up to “just a phenomenon.”

That wasn’t the case though. Nvidia chose the Samsung 8nm node for the Ampere range and sources blamed the shortage on the poor yields of the node. Essentially the manufacturing process produced fewer usable chips than expected. Nvidia later acknowledged the problem and changed its stance pointing some of the blame at Samsung.

At the same time DRAM prices started to rise due to limited supply which is still affecting the market today. These memory modules are essential to multiple PC components including graphics cards.

Between industry-wide issues poor yields at Samsung rising DRAM prices and of course the pandemic Nvidia had to fight an uphill battle to get cards built and shipped. These factors lead to a limited supply of Ampere cards at launch which would have posed an issue regardless of the pandemic.

Because of the pandemic the shortage came faster lasted longer and got more out of hand than any previous one.

Enter the scalpers

Scalpers were quick to capitalize on the limited supply and high demand. Almost immediately after launch scalpers started sharing their winning strategy for buying up GPUs: Bots. One user reported grabbing 42 cards while others said they scored 30 or more.

The pandemic helped fuel the success of bots. Instead of a physical launch the supply of Ampere cards was limited to online retailers. By scanning multiple retailers and exploiting the checkout processes bots were able to buy up cards faster than any human could. And without a way to buy a card in person the available stock quickly dwindled.

Reports of bot use mainly came from social media posts so it’s hard to pin down just how many cards scalpers claimed at launch. However the power of hindsight confirms that the reports were at least somewhat accurate. In 2020 scalpers sold around 50000 Nvidia RTX 30 series graphics cards totaling $61.5 million in sales.

It was clear that bots were able to grab and at least for a short period of time control the market. Shortly after the launch of the RTX 3080 Nvidia announced it would delay the launch of the RTX 3070 to make “more cards available on launch day.” To stem the bleeding further Nvidia partnered with Best Buy for exclusive distribution of Founders Edition cards in the U.S.

Given the pandemic retailers like Best Buy resorted to selling the cards exclusively online. However some retailers such as Micro Center moved to in-store sales shortly after launch. Even months later hopeful buyers continued to camp out for hours at Micro Center locations around the country.

During this time graphics card maker EVGA introduced a queue-based notification system for graphics cards to combat bots. This remains one of the most effective ways to buy a GPU at list price providing buyers a window of eight hours to purchase a graphics card when their name comes up in the queue.

Despite these measures bots grabbed much of the available stock and given the yield issues that stock wasn’t immediately replenished. Online retailers like Newegg implemented anti-bot measures and order limits but it was too late. The cards were already gone and it would be a slow process to get them back.

Under the thumb of a trade war

Across the Pacific there were more problems brewing in the semiconductor industry. On September 26 2020 the U.S. Commerce Department imposed restrictions on SMIC China’s largest semiconductor company. That pushed U.S. business to chipmakers TSMC in Taiwan and Samsung in Korea and they were already operating at full capacity.

The trade war between the U.S. and China began in 2018 when tariffs were imposed on solar panels and washing machines. A flurry of restrictions and tariffs came in the following years but the restriction placed on SMIC came at the worst possible time.

It’s important to remember that the issues facing the semiconductor industry were ongoing at this point and the restrictions on SMIC came only nine days after the RTX 3080 launched. Stock was already low before the restriction and with big clients looking to buy up capacity the GPU shortage would go from bad to worse.

AMD gets cocky with RDNA 2

AMD announced the RDNA 2-powered RX 6800 XT 6800 and 6900 XT on October 28 2020. Competing with Nvidia on performance and offering ray tracing for the first time on AMD hardware the cards looked like an answer to the GPU shortage.

It looked like that was AMD’s view too as the company’s Chief Architect of Gaming Solutions and Marketing suggested it wouldn’t be a “paper launch” like Nvidia’s Ampere range.

It was though as all available units sold out within minutes of going live. Originally AMD said it would meet the demand in the weeks following the launch. However the cards remained out of stock at retailers and prices surged on the secondhand market following the pattern that Nvidia’s Ampere cards experienced a few months earlier.

AMD faced some unique challenges compared to Nvidia however. In addition to three new graphics cards the company launched a series of new processors at the same time as well as provided the framework for the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5. And AMD chose TSMC as its chipmaker for all of them.

AMD entered the market as the GPU shortage started to come into focus. Multiple product launches drove up demand at semiconductor companies above their already high levels and the pandemic continued to disrupt the global economy. Although AMD’s cards sold for less on the secondhand market they were still selling for much more than their suggested price.

Crypto booms

Going into the end of 2020 a boom in cryptocurrency prices would further extend the GPU shortage. Although the boom happened in December demand from crypto miners has been constant throughout the shortage and the last several GPU launches.

It’s hard to tell just how many cards went to crypto-miners but the number is high.

Shortly after launch photos started circulating of mining rigs housing dozens of Nvidia and AMD graphics cards. Similarly Nvidia’s specially designed mining cards drew in $155 million in revenue in the first few months after launching. This isn’t new for the GPU market either. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang even recognized the issue publicly when a spike in Ethereum prices increased demand in 2018.

However a massive increase in the value of Bitcoin and Ethereum in December 2020 drew the attention of industrialists to jump on the mining train. On December 1 2020 Ethereum sold for around $590 per coin and Bitcoin sold for around $18900 per coin. By the end of January Ethereum was up $1500 and Bitcoin was up to $35000.

The rise caused more large-scale mining operations to pop up like one set up by one of Russia’s largest oil producers entirely powered by oil.

It’s hard to tell just how many cards went to crypto-miners but the number is high. In the first part of 2021 while the crypto boom was continuing to happen miners accounted for around 25% of all GPU sales. Like other factors contributing to the shortage demand from crypto-miners isn’t solely responsible. Given the context however it continued to make GPUs extremely difficult to find.

Companies couldn’t ignore the shortage anymore which is why rumors started circulating that Nvidia was reintroducing the RTX 2060 to combat demand. MSI eventually reintroduced the GT 730 a seven-year-old GPU to provide an option for builders without integrated graphics too.

Newegg also set up a raffle-style system called Shuffle where the company would randomly select participants for a chance to buy high-demand products. The program is still going today but Newegg often bundles cards with other PC components bloating the price.

Out of the penalty box — tariffs

At the start of 2021 the GPU market continued to struggle as supply remained low and demand continued to rise. The aforementioned trade war with China was still in full swing with tariffs taxing goods imported from the country. Originally graphics cards were given an exception to the trade plan but that expired at the beginning of 2021.

PC components aren’t normally subject to an import tax but under the “list 3” trade action that taxes about $200 billion worth of products from China graphics cards were subject to a 25% import tax.

Cards didn’t immediately jump 25% in price and given the limited inventory at retailers the list price of GPUs didn’t matter much. However some graphics card makers passed the extra cost onto customers. For example Asus said that it would update its MSRP to reflect “increases in cost for components operating costs and logistical activities plus a continuation of import tariffs.”

This is where AIBs come into play. They’re the main source of graphics cards on the market especially after the initial launch window. Nvidia and AMD are free to set whatever price they want for their cards but AIBs ultimately have to set a price based on the cost of components logistics and any taxes or fees they may be subject to.

At the end of 2020 and into the start of 2021 the price of AIB units grew to unprecedented levels. This is why graphics cards continue to sell for as much as twice their MSRP at retailers matching the prices on the secondhand market. In other parts of the world retailers were selling cards for more than triple MSRP.

Toward the end of February Nvidia came up with a new plan to combat the GPU shortage: Lite Hash Rate (LHR) graphics cards. Coinciding with the launch of the RTX 3060 Nvidia announced that it would halve the Ethereum hash rate — how much cryptocurrency the card can mine — through a driver.

At the same time Nvidia announced Cryptocurrency Mining Processor (CMP) cards which don’t have video outputs and are built specifically for mining. The two steps together were according to Nvidia meant to “ensure GeForce GPUs end up in the hands of gamers.”

But they didn’t work. Nvidia released a beta driver shortly after the launch of the RTX 3060 that disabled the mining limiter and because the fix was only issued through software users were able to download and distribute the driver to make the limiter obsolete.

When pressed for a similar response AMD responded with “no.” Following the launch of the RX 6700 XT an AMD rep said the company’s response was no response at all saying “we will not be blocking any workload not just mining for that matter.”

The beginning of 2021 was when the chip shortage that contributed to the GPU shortage started to become clear. Intel’s CEO warned that the chip shortage would last into 2022 and Nvidia said that it expected demand to exceed supply throughout 2021. It seemed the only way out of the shortage was to wait it out.

Nvidia wasn’t down and out though. The company reintroduced the LHR concept to the rest of the Ampere range to deal with crypto-mining demand. This time however Nvidia didn’t solve the issue through a driver update. Instead it introduced new GPU cores that would limit the Ethereum hash rate at a hardware level.

This was the first step from graphics card companies to get the market back on track and in the months that followed a number of factors would help improve GPU supply if only by a bit.

A shift in strategy

In May Nvidia launched the RTX 3080 Ti and RTX 3070 Ti but the launch plans were a little different. Using its partnership with Best Buy Nvidia released the RTX 3080 Ti exclusively in Best Buy stores helping deal with bots and the chaotic checkout process that comes with new launches.

Meanwhile the Ethereum Foundation said it would move from a proof-of-work model — like Bitcoin uses — to a proof-of-stake model. In addition to lowering the energy consumption of mining the coin the shift would remove GPUs from the mining equation. In its quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission Nvidia said the move could increase “aftermarket resales of our GPUs and may reduce demand for our new GPUs.”

On top of that the prices for Bitcoin and Ethereum started to drop and China which held the lion’s share of Bitcoin miners imposed new restrictions on crypto-mining. Although none of these steps ended the GPU shortage they helped steer the market back toward normalcy.

And Nvidia was quick to capitalize. Following all of the shifts in the GPU market a report circulated that Nvidia was taking the RTX 2060 back out of production to focus on production of the latest cards.

The current state of the GPU market

The GPU shortage isn’t over but it’s in a much better spot. With tools like EVGA’s queue system Newegg Shuffle and in-store restocks at Micro Center it’s possible to find a new graphics card in the U.S.

The situation is improving in other parts of the world too. Recent months have brought an increase in GPU supply in European countries driving down the price. In Germany prices have dropped as much as 50% from their peak at the beginning of 2021.

Still the GPU market is recovering — it hasn’t recovered. Tariffs and the increased cost of components have pushed AIBs to sell cards far above the marks Nvidia and AMD set. This is the biggest issue with the GPU market right now especially as Nvidia pushes out updated LHR versions of its cards. For example some updated RTX 3060 models — which should retail for $329 — are selling for close to $1000 brand new.

Looking forward all the GPU market needs is time. Scalpers have become less effective as more cards make it onto the market and demand from crypto-miners has dropped thanks to falling prices and new regulations. Supply chain issues which arguably kicked off this shortage remain the main constraining factor and it could be years before they’re worked out.

The biggest issue now is overcompensation. As Nvidia points out it may need to place “non-cancellable inventory orders significantly in advance of our normal lead times pay premiums or provide deposits to secure normal and incremental future supply.” Manufacturing capacity is valuable at the moment and companies generally need to buy that capacity well in advance.

With the pandemic winding down in most parts of the world the computing market expansion may wind down too. That could lead to companies ordering parts they can’t reasonably sell which could crash the GPU market.

In that case at least hopeful buyers wouldn’t have to worry about overpaying for a graphics card.

Chipmakers Nvidia (NVDA -1.84%) and Micron Technology (MU -1.27%) have had very different experiences on the stock market so far in 2021 even though both companies have been delivering stellar results quarter after quarter. While Nvidia stock has handily beaten the market Micron shares have remained nearly flat thus far.

Is this a signal that investors should start dumping Micron stock and load up on Nvidia? Well like many market questions this one doesn't have a simple answer. Here's what investors need to know.

The case for Micron Technology

Micron Technology is benefiting from the terrific demand for memory chips. The memory specialist's revenue jumped 36% year over year in the fiscal third quarter (ended June 3 2021) while earnings more than doubled to $1.88 per share from $0.82 per share in the prior-year period.

Micron's fourth-quarter guidance suggests that it isn't going to run out of steam anytime soon. The company's $8.2 billion revenue guidance for this quarter would translate into a 36% year-over-year gain while the $2.30 per share adjusted earnings forecast means that its bottom line is on track to more than double from the prior-year period's $1.08 per share.

However the market hasn't appreciated this terrific growth as the muted stock price performance shows. But that may not be the case forever as Micron is sitting on a bunch of solid catalysts which seem strong enough to help it maintain its high levels of growth in the long run.

Micron's compute and networking business unit (CNBU) which is its largest source of revenue and accounts for 44.5% of its top line witnessed nearly 49% year-over-year revenue growth in Q3. Micron caters to the personal computer (PC) cloud server enterprise graphics and networking markets through this segment. There is great demand for memory chips in all these markets which is leading to tight supplies and higher prices.

Memory market research firm TrendForce estimates that the price of dynamic random access memory (DRAM) could increase between 3% and 8% in the third quarter of the calendar year over Q2. The price increase is a result of strong server and PC DRAM demand and constrained supply.

Similarly the demand for NAND flash has also remained high due to the increased adoption of SSDs (solid-state drives) in both consumer PCs and enterprise hardware. A tight supply means that the price of NAND flash memory is expected to increase between 5% and 10% this quarter which bodes well for Micron's storage business unit (SBU). The segment produced 13% of Micron's top line last quarter and its revenue was flat year over year at $1 billion -- but it could improve given the end-market dynamics.

The mobile business unit meanwhile has hit a purple patch. Its revenue increased 31% year over year in Q3 thanks to the ramp-up in 5G smartphone demand. With 5G smartphones expected to increase at a whopping pace in the next five years Micron's mobile business has room to run higher.

The robust memory demand isn't going to go away anytime soon. According to a third-party forecast memory chip demand is expected to increase 31.7% in 2021 followed by a double-digit increase in 2022 which explains why analysts expect Micron's growth to pick up the pace next fiscal year.

The case for Nvidia

Nvidia's stock market returns in 2021 have been driven by the company's outstanding results. The graphics specialist is growing at a much faster pace than Micron with its fiscal first-quarter revenue jumping 84% year over year to $5.66 billion. Tremendous demand for Nvidia's graphics cards which are used in PCs sent its video gaming revenue soaring. The segment's revenue doubled year over year and accounted for close to half of its top line.

There are two reasons why the video gaming segment is set for terrific growth in the long haul. First Nvidia dominates this market with a market share of 81% according to Jon Peddie Research. It is also worth noting that the chipmaker has substantially increased its presence in the gaming laptop market.

The company's dominant position in the gaming graphics card market brings us to the second reason why this segment is built for growth. Jon Peddie Research estimates that gaming graphics cards could generate $54 billion in revenue by 2025 which would be a big jump over last year's sales of $23.6 billion. Nvidia sold $7.76 billion worth of graphics cards in fiscal 2021 so the additional revenue opportunity on offer and the company's huge market share indicates that this business still has a lot of room for growth.

There's a similar story to Nvidia's data center business which is its second-largest source of revenue. The segment's revenue shot up 79% year over year in Q1 crossing $2 billion in quarterly sales for the first time. With the data center accelerator market expected to clock $53 billion in annual revenue by the end of 2027 according to a third-party estimate the segment's growth streak seems sustainable.

Nvidia is doing well in the market for data center graphics processing units (GPUs) with large cloud service providers preferring to use the company's chips to accelerate workloads. The data center GPU market alone is expected to generate $20 billion in revenue by 2027. Nvidia sold almost $6.7 billion worth of data center GPUs last fiscal year and the massive revenue opportunity points toward more upside in this business.

Throw in the fact that Nvidia is now moving to tap the other fast-growing niches of the data center accelerator market such as server central processing units (CPUs) and data processing units (DPUs) and it becomes easier to see why this segment probably won't run out of steam. Such solid growth drivers make it clear why Nvidia's earnings are expected to jump substantially in the future at an annual pace of nearly 27%.

The verdict

It is evident that both Nvidia and Micron Technology have impressive catalysts that could help them sustain their impressive pace of growth. Value-oriented investors however may lean toward buying Micron stock as it trades at just 20 times trailing earnings compared to Nvidia's multiple of nearly 91.

But then Nvidia is growing at a much faster rate than Micron as we saw above which is why its premium seems justified. Additionally Nvidia dominates its space while Micron faces competition from the likes of SK Hynix and Samsung. Micron reportedly controls 23.5% of the DRAM market which makes it a smaller player than the other two while it stands in fourth position in the NAND market with a share of just 11.2%.

That's why investors with a higher risk tolerance might want to consider buying Nvidia stock to benefit from the tech giant's supremacy in graphics cards as it seems capable of outperforming Micron in the future like it has done so far this year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRibHRhcC5jb20vcG9zdHMvYW1hem9uLWdhbWVzLW5ldy13b3JsZC1pcy1icmlja2luZy1zb21lLW52aWRpYS1nZWZvcmNlLXJ0eC0zMDkwLWdyYXBoaWNzLWNhcmRzLTAxZmJmYzd3dmticdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazon Games' New World is 'Bricking' Some NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Graphics Cards,Please read this message regarding recent concerns with graphics cards hardware. pic.twitter.com/L1gNeBBPQS,,,

Just days after his current employer — the NBA’s Phoenix Suns — fell to the Milwaukee Bucks in the NBA Finals the next goal for the team’s director of medical services and head trainer is clear.

And that’s to do everything he and his staff can do to help get the Suns to the same level as the Bucks who won their first championship in 50 years with a Game 6 victory at Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee on Tuesday night.

Crewe hasn’t had much time to even take a breath since there’s now a shortened offseason to prepare for. That’s already included helping Suns superstar Devin Booker transition quickly to the Olympics in Tokyo which begin for Team USA on Sunday.

While Crewe who now has two seasons under his belt with the Suns and the rest of the organization didn’t quite reach the pinnacle of the NBA that doesn’t mean the last several months and the deep playoff run to within two wins of a title didn’t leave them with everlasting memories.

“Obviously it was a successful season” Crewe said by telephone Friday from his home in Arizona. “It was one that I think internally we all knew we were capable of. I think we surprised some people obviously but we’ve been building it for a while ever since I got here.

“It was fun to be part of it. It was motivating just to be around people who were that professional and locked in mentally and physically. We prepared every day. I think we all knew we had something special in-house. It kind of motivates you and inspires you to want to rise to the occasion. It was fun from that end.”

Crewe’s career has taken him through two professional leagues. He had a three-year stint with the NFL’s Kansas City Chiefs followed by tenures with the NBA’s Minnesota Timberwolves (2013-18) and the Memphis Grizzlies (2018-19).

But it was this recently concluded season where the motivation and drive that has gotten him to this point in his career took an extra step he said.

“It was really motivating” said Crewe who attended UW-La Crosse and California University of Pennsylvania after graduating from Tremper High School. “I’ve told my folks I’ve told friends that this year was probably the most motivating for me internally. I felt like I wanted to rise to the occasion.

“You didn’t want to be the one to let anybody down. You wanted to be the one to help push and make sure we were leaving no stone unturned so to speak.”

Facing the challenge

In last year’s shortened season which concluded in the bubble in Orlando Fla. because of the COVID-19 pandemic the Suns posted a 34-39 record to finish 10th in the Western Conference. That made the team’s 51-21 record and first-place finish atop the standings this season a bit of a surprise.

But it didn’t change the way Crewe and his staff approached their task other than they were well-aware of the added strain the extended season would take on the players as Phoenix made its way through the playoffs and into the Finals against Milwaukee.

“You start looking at what we need to do to sustain this into the end of July” Crewe said. “What do we need to do to prepare them for a longer stint? How do we make them more robust?

“My main goal is to make that feel like they’re prepared for anything. For a lot of the guys on our team our staff included it was kind of unchartered territory. A lot of us had never been to the Finals and experienced that so you’re kind of going into the unknown and trying to make sure you’re preparing yourselves and everybody else as best you can for what is a long long postseason.”

And even though the 2020-21 season now is in the books it’s not like there’s a significant amount of time before the league gets back at it.

In fact NBA training camps begin in almost exactly two months so there’s plenty to be done before the journey starts all over again.

But don’t think for a second Crewe isn’t relishing that next challenge.

“It’s a really good problem to have” he said. “If you had told me last year that this (shortened offseason) would be an issue I would take it with open arms. It’s something we’ve been discussing throughout the postseason planning and preparing.

“We have a plan in place. It’s geared around a little bit of re-centering yourself refocusing and reflecting on what we’ve done and what we need to work on.”

Leading the way

Working with superstars and legends comes with the territory when your employer is a professional sports team so that’s nothing new for Crewe.

But with the Suns he has the opportunity to not only interact and work with one budding star in Booker but a future Hall of Famer and league legend in Chris Paul.

And when it comes to the head coach Monty Williams Crewe says there aren’t enough adjectives available to describe what he’s meant to not only the team but to Crewe himself.

“Monty is one of the best human beings you’ll ever come into contact with” Crewe said. “I think that speaks loudly to our organization to identify him as our leader. He honestly brings out the best in every person he comes into contact with.

“He makes you want to be a better trainer be a better person a better son father or whatever you might be. He makes you want to bring out the best in yourself and everybody around you. He cares about everybody on a personal level which pretty much resonates throughout our building on a daily basis.”

Williams who like Crewe joined the organization for the 2019-20 season has that “fatherly figure” personality that meshes well especially with such a young team like the Suns Crewe said.

And the coach who turns 50 in October can relate to everyone in the organization on many levels including how to deal with tragedy after the death of his wife in 2016 in an automobile accident.

“He does a great job of being a coach but also being more than a coach” Crewe said. “He’s just the true embodiment of what you think of when you think of a head coach. He’s a teacher but also a confidant someone you can talk to about anything not just basketball.

“Obviously there has been more than basketball in his life and these young men’s lives. There’s more to it. A lot of times the basketball part comes easy. That’s the stuff they don’t have to worry about. But he’s done a great job. It’s awesome to work for him.”

Just minutes after his team lost to the Bucks Williams was seen in the Milwaukee locker room offering his congratulations to the squad.

And moments like that are just who he is Crewe said.

“What you see in his video clips or his postgame press conferences is all genuine” he said. “It’s not for show. It’s not a schtick. It’s who he is. He’s meant a lot to me and my development as a man. I love working for him.”

Two stars

Paul a likely Hall of Famer with a storied career that began in 2005 and has spanned five different organizations fits the bill as a true legend in every sense of the word Crewe said.

“Chris is a true pro” he said. “You don’t have the resume he has without being that way. He pushes you and he really wants to bring out the best in everybody and he always shows an appreciation for everybody involved. He’s a class act.”

And Paul who has a longstanding relationship with Williams is an extension of the coach both on and off the floor Crewe added.

“He’s a class act” Crewe said. “I think there’s a reason why he and Monty have such a great relationship. They’re saying the same thing every day. When a guy like that walks into your facility you feel comfortable with him.

“He’s genuine. He brings a ton of experience and a ton of true grit to our facility. His actions are louder than his words. You can feel a difference with him. He’s been great. ... It’s kind of surreal to work with him. He’s going to be one of the best point guards to ever do it. I’ve worked with other greats before but it’s been special.”

At the other end of the spectrum — but maybe with a similar end-point — is Booker who won’t turn 25 until October but has emerged as one of the game’s top players since he was drafted in 2015 with the 13th overall pick.

Booker who will be an Olympic teammate with Bucks stars Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday hasn’t reached that level by accident Crewe said.

“Devin is a pro just like everybody else on our team” Crewe said. “He puts in all the work he needs to prepare himself the best he can. He works around the clock on everything on his body on his skill set.

“The fact that he’s going right into the Olympics speaks loudly to who he is. Some guys may have bailed in the last minute saying ‘I’m just beat up I’m tired I don’t want to do it.’ But he wants to do it. He wants to represent the country show the world how good he is and he wants to represent our team and our city. He’s a class act through and through.”

What Booker did in the Finals against Milwaukee — becoming the third player in history to have back-to-back 40-point games en route to averaging 27.3 points per game — could be just the beginning for him Crewe said.

“The world got to see it a little bit in the Finals” he said. “He’s going to hit his ceiling and break through it to be honest.”

And speaking of ceilings Crewe reiterated what he’s felt since the Finals ended.

There’s no time to dwell only time to look ahead.

“I think when you get as close as we did I think it really motivates guys and makes them want to get right back to work” Crewe said. “To be so close and fall short is motivating in itself.

“I know for me I had a little period of ‘Man I wish that could have been us’ but then I wanted to get right back into it. I’m sure the players feel even stronger about that.”

Though Bill O’Reilly has reported for CBS News and ABC News in the past his most noteworthy role was starring in his self-titled talk show The O’Reilly Factor on Fox News Channel. Currently Bill O’Reilly is hosting a series called No Spin News on O’Reilly’s own website and the video hosting site Youtube. In 2020 it was announced that his latest talk show would eventually air on WABC one of the conservative radio stations owned by Donald Trump ally John Catsimatidis. Whether he’s hosting the news or making news headlines (for all the wrong reasons) pretty much everyone at this point has heard of Bill O’Reilly. Keep reading for more on his career his net worth and a look at the Bill O’Reilly House.

Where Does Bill O’Reilly Live?

Talk show host Bill O’Reilly seems to spend the majority of his time these days at his home in Manhasset a Hamlet in Long Island New York. He reportedly purchased the home back in 2000 and it has acted as his main residence ever since. In addition to his Long Island abode O’Reilly also has a home in Montauk – more on that below!

Bill O’Reilly Montauk house

Located at the top of a bluff that overlooks the Atlantic Ocean O’Reilly purchased what was originally a 600 square foot 1940s cottage on a 1.5-acre plot back in 2013. The cottage was originally listed for $8.5 million but O’Reilly managed to pick it up for the discounted price of $7.65.

Town & Country Real Estate

The 2-bedroom cottage was loved by the locals and almost considered a landmark in the area which is why many were upset with O’Reilly’s decision to tear the whole thing down to build a new home on the site.

While there isn’t much online about O’Reilly’s custom home on the plot what we can say is that it’s substantially larger than the previous structure.

Additionally the new 2-story home on the property features a spacious 2-car garage at least 1 fireplace a massive balcony on the second floor that overlooks the ocean a pool & spa and a smaller detached structure that looks as though it could potentially be a guest house.

Bill O’Reilly House Manhasset NY

Purchased in 2000 for $3 million Bill O’Reilly’s home in Manhasset is a colonial-style 2-story residence located on a corner lot near Manhasset Bay. According to property records the home was built in 1928 and boasts 10 rooms total and 5 bathrooms.

Some features of the 4631 square foot home include a 2-car garage 2 fireplaces and lots of windows that allow for ample natural lighting in every room of the house.

Outside there’s a massive swimming pool and lounge area as well as a gazebo nearby so whether you’re looking to soak up the sun or stay in the shade – the choice is yours!

Bill O’Reilly House Address

Bill O’Reilly’s home in Montauk is located on Old Montauk Highway. His home in Long Island is on Shore Drive. For more photos and the address visit his home profile on Velvet Ropes linked at the top of the article!

Bill O’Reilly Family

Bill O’Reilly’s parents are Winifred Angela (Drake) O’Reilly and William James Sr both of Irish Descent. Winifred was a homemaker and worked as a physical therapist while William worked as a currency accountant with the oil company Caltex.

While Bill O’Reilly’s statements about his family’s financial struggles when he was a child weren’t false it seems as though the O’Reilly children weren’t really deprived of anything either. Both Bill and his sister Janet were still able to attend a private school and Bill himself ended up going to the University of London without financial aid.

O’Reilly’s father died in 1986 at the age of 62 and his mother passed away at the age of 92 in 2016. More on Bill O’Reilly’s family below.

Bill O’Reilly Wife

WireImage

Bill O’Reilly was married to Maureen E. McPhilmy from 1996 to 2011. While some divorces end with a civil agreement between both parties that the marriage is over O’Reilly and McPhilmy’s separation was anything but amicable. Despite the fact that they divorced in 2011 it seems their legal and domestic battles have withstood the test of time.

An affidavit used during the former couple’s divorce proceedings recounts a time when McPhilmy caught her husband having phone sex at their home one night and once confronted O’Reilly physically attacked her. The claim was only made more concrete when the O’Reilly’s daughter Madeline told forensic examiners that she had been witness to her father actually choking her mother at one point.

Following the divorce O’Reilly even attempted to have his ex-wife excommunicated from their church for remarrying. Given that an investigation by The New York Times found O’Reilly has had not 1 but 6 separate sexual harassment claims against him from his former female co-workers at Fox News which resulted in settlements adding up to $45 million and his contract with Fox News being terminated it seems that McPhilmy getting remarried should be the least of O’Reilly’s concerns at this point…just saying!

Bill O’Reilly Children

Bill O’Reilly and ex-wife Maureen McPhilmy have two children together – Madeline (age 23) and Spencer O’Reilly (age 18). Little is known about the O’Reilly children but Madeline did make headlines when she testified against her father in court for domestic abuse claims made by her mother.

How Old Is Bill O’Reilly?

Bill O’Reilly was born September 10 1949 – making him currently 71 years old.

Bill O’Reilly Net Worth

According to Celebrity Net Worth Bill O’Reilly’s net worth is reportedly around $85 million as of 2020 with some speculating that it could actually be even higher than current estimates.

In addition to the money O’Reilly makes from television he also receives a decent chunk of cash from his books. Some of his titles include Killing Jesus (2013) Hitler’s Last Stand (2015) and most recently Killing Crazy Horse (2020).

Does Bill O’Reilly own O’Reilly Auto Parts

Quick answer: No former Fox News host Bill O’Reilly has absolutely zero connection with the automotive parts store. Strangely however the two actually had a weird connection briefly.

Immediately after news broke of Bill O’Reilly’s departure from Fox News stocks in O’Reilly Auto Parts rose by 3%. This left many stock market experts scratching their heads but some have speculated that a computer algorithm that trades stocks based on social media buzz may have taken the frequent mention of Bill O’Reilly on media platforms as a signal to purchase stocks in the retailer.

Although she is a Hampton High School music teacher she was the one learning July 16 during a DJ class at Old Dominion University’s Brooks Crossing Innovation Lab in Newport News. Taught by DJ Rick Geez and DJ Karee from 103 Jamz the class learned about choosing songs to blend together counting bars and fading music in and out.

The program is a five-session trial on Mondays and Fridays and ends Monday. The current class is full but if things go smoothly they may offer more and include children said Mia Joe the lab’s director.

The lab is part of a larger facility called the Brooks Crossing Innovation and Opportunity Center focused on workforce development and STEM learning. It’s stocked with science technology engineering and mathematics tools — such as a recording studio vinyl and laser cutters 3D printers a woodshop sewing machines a mixed reality space and an electronic workbench.

It’s a partnership involving ODU Newport News Shipbuilding and the city of Newport News.

Both DJs Rick Geez and Karee are part of Music Theory Studios a Norfolk-based company that sells beats hosts online and in-studio classes and provides free music instruction music and art events in the community.

Four students showed up Friday each getting a laptop loaded with Serato DJ software equipment to make beats and music to choose from like The Notorious B.I.G.’s “One More Chance” and Roddy Ricch’s “High Fashion.”

“We’re teaching them how to use the program Serato” said Rick Geez who has been a DJ since 1995 and has toured with the rap duo Clipse. “Last week I was DJing for Beanie Sigel and Juelz Santana at the Norfolk Scope. I love rocking parties and DJing events. Hopefully I can show somebody what I did and inspire other people.”

Also on the syllabus: transitioning from one song to the next and marking specific parts of the songs with “hot cues.”

Hot cues aren’t something all DJs use DJ Karee said. Those with more experience can feel it and already are familiar with the songs but they wanted to teach them to the class because they’re one of the basics of DJing.

“I put a cue on that part of the song so when I go DJ somewhere I can start the song from there” DJ Karee said. “It’s basically a shortcut to any part of the song.”

Mitchell chose to work with Michael Jackson’s 1992 single “Remember the Time” and Nelly’s 2002 song “Hot in Herre.”

She and other students learned about counting how many bars are in a song’s chorus. The instructors used a chart to help them understand and walked them through a sample song. As they listened they focused on the song’s drums counting along.

One two three four.

Two two three four.

Three two three four.

Four two three four.

“So this song has a four-bar intro” DJ Rick Geez said. “So if I have a song that has an eight-bar chorus and this song has a four-bar intro I can let four bars of the chorus play and then bring this in. When the chorus is done the lyrics start. This is the perfect blend.”

Mitchell was familiar with Michael Jackson’s song but she had to go back and listen to her second track “Hot in Herre.”

“How does the song start?” she recalled asking herself. “Where do I mark the first hot cue? It’s a listening experience.”

At one point DJ Rick Geez came over to help out and scrubbed the record moving the turntable to produce that old-school transitional sound that often hypes up the crowd.

Mitchell smiled and laughed.

“I realized that I could fade the music in and out and then it took me back to the times when I went into the clubs and I was at school” she said.

The classes are a mixture of fun and hands-on job training for her.

“This is totally totally selfish” she said. “It really is for me because I really enjoy learning but I get hands-on experience. I get to write up a lesson plan share with my students and then bring them in here and let them experience all that.”

She was at the lab’s opening in 2019 and thinks it’s a “diamond mine” because locals can get hands-on experience for free.

She’s also familiar with DJ Karee’s wife and Music Theory Studios CEO Jazzarae Jones who she met a few years ago. The pair collaborate on local projects.

Mitchell was so thrilled after Friday’s class that she chose songs to practice at home.

“I’m going to figure out where the choruses are where I want the hot cues to be and then when I come back to class I’m going to queue them up and I’m going to mix them in” she said. “It’ll be fun. I get to go home and play.”

Va. — James Okonkwo confirmed through his Twitter account Sunday that he is about to make one interesting jump to the WVU men’s basketball team.

Just hours after competing in the Nike Peach Jam AAU tournament in Georgia Okonkwo signed his National Letter of Intent and will enroll at WVU in August for the fall semester.

The interesting part: Okonkwo just 17-years old was just a month away from beginning his junior year of high school.

“I’m extremely blessed to be in the position that I am in now and I’m excited to announce that after long consideration I will be enrolling at WVU in the fall of 2021” Okonkwo tweeted.

A 6-foot-9 230-pound forward originally from Maidenhead England Okonkwo played last season as a sophomore at Beckley Prep for head coach Justin Dempsey.

WVU wasn’t expecting to receive Okonkwo’s letter of intent until Monday when it can make his signing official. WVU coaches are not permitted by NCAA rules to discuss any recruit until they have received his signed letter.

While it’s not exactly rare for high school athletes to graduate early and enroll in college that generally happens after the junior season of competition.

Okonkwo is eligible for college in the United States before his high school junior year due to his grades from the General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) program he took while still in England.

The GCSE is a series of tests in different subjects that students in England Northern Ireland and Wales take as 15 and 16-year olds.

By U.S. standards a GCSE is the equivalent of a high school diploma or GED.

He first committed to the Mountaineers in June to be part of the 2023 recruiting class.

Okonkwo was ranked a four-star prospect and as the No. 87 overall recruit nationally for the 2023 class by Rivals.com.

“I liked how genuine everyone was from the coaches to the players” Okonkwo told the Blue&Gold News in June. “The culture of the program and the facilities everything I saw when I was able to visit after they opened up their focus is on developing and getting better. That’s what I am all about too.”

Due to COVID-19 Beckley Prep was limited to just 13 games last season and Okonkwo missed some of those games due to a broken finger.

He also had a scholarship offer from Rutgers.

Okonkwo will take the 13th and final scholarship for the Mountaineers next season but he announced on social media he was planning to redshirt and then play during the 2022-23 season.

Speaking at Big 12 Media Days earlier this month conference coordinator of officials Greg Burks informed reporters that there will ""probably be a penalty"" should a player flash the ""Horns Down"" gesture in games against the Longhorns.

Dallas Cowboys wideout and former Oklahoma star CeeDee Lamb disagrees with the move.

""That’s definitely nonsense"" Lamb said Thursday on 105.3 The Fan. ""I think they kind of started it going into my junior year or probably sophomore year. They kind of said it was going to be an issue when you do it on the field. They kind of tried to slow it down but now that they kind of made an announcement that’s — you’ve got to go play football.

""They can worry about their own stuff.”

Former Oklahoma quarterback Baker Mayfield took to Twitter in wake of Burks' comments calling Texas ""mentally weak"" and suggesting that Big 12 officials are going to extra lengths in protecting one of the of flagship institutions within the conference.

While appearing at a youth football camp a day later the current Cleveland Browns signal caller questioned while meeting with reporters if Texas' ""Hook 'Em Horns"" hand gesture should also receive a penalty if used during a game before reiterating his social media comment from a week ago.

""So should it be a penalty if they do horns up to another player?"" Mayfield asked via ESPN's Jake Trotter before sarcastically stating that ""I'm just happy they're protecting the Longhorns now.""

The Big 12 is trying to crack down on players taunting during games.

“‘We’re not going to let players taunt.’ Major pushback to the Team Trash Talk agenda” Travis Hines of the Des Moines Register tweeted in a thread. “‘If you do a Horns Down to a Texas player as an opponent that's probably going to be a foul. If you turn to your crowd and do a Horns Down...it probably won't be a foul.’ It remains profoundly funny in a sport as violent and ruthless as college football that the powers that be remain focused and concerned about hurting people's feelings.”

The production shortfall adds to 30000 vehicles that the manufacturer hasn’t been able to produce in 2021 alone and is also driving up prices for some options and packages.

The chip shortage is said to be primarily affecting BMW’s German plants which build the bulk of the company’s products but BMW Group Plant Spartanburg which manufactures the X series from X3 through X7 is also said to be feeling the strain as customers struggle to order the G01 X3 LCI with certain features and options according to BMWBlog.

BMW Group vehicles including those from the BMW Mini Rolls-Royce brands use as many if not more computer chips than other vehicles on the market but the automaker is reported to have largely avoided the troubles of other makes by anticipating the declining supply and appropriately adjusting production. Nevertheless the combination of circumstances and conditions that are said to have attributed to the shortage have continued largely unabated and BMW has joined the rest of the automotive industry in feeling the affects.

Although the coronavirus outbreak and subsequent pandemic are described as catalysts for the chip shortage thanks to subsequent temporary factory shutdowns and skyrocketing demand owing to employers embracing work from home a drought in Taiwan and continued high demand attributed to economic recovery and government stimulus are said to have created the current scenario. During the first half of 2021 Taiwan experienced its most severe drought in decades leading to a shortage of water among semiconductor manufacturers which use the resource as an input to sanitize the wafers that form the basis of microchips. At the same time demand for goods that use chips has continued to outpace pre-pandemic levels and the manufacturers of such legacy chips have been unable to scale production.

Computer graphics cards video game consoles and motor vehicles have been the most heavily impacted products. Graphics cards or GPUs continue to sell for well above MSRP and the price of used and new cars has risen in dramatic fashion. As recently as May Ford parked enough unfinished vehicles at Kentucky Speedway for the mass to be seen from space. BMW sales both in the U.S. and globally have continued to expand in 2021 beyond pre-2020 levels but executives have cautioned that the numbers would be even greater if not for the chip shortage.—Alex Tock

Since the early days of the pandemic in 2020 when car makers around the world began shuttering factories to try and curb the spread of the virus it began a chain reaction that has led to limited stock in showrooms and now car companies are openly considering cutting back on the amount of technology they offer in cars.

So how did we get here? What does it mean to those looking to buy a car? And what is the solution?

What are semiconductors?

According to Britannica.com a semiconductor is “any of a class of crystalline solids intermediate in electrical conductivity between a conductor and an insulator”.

Broadly speaking you can think of a semiconductor as a microchip a tiny piece of technology that helps so much of the modern world run.

Semiconductors are used in everything from cars and computers to smartphones and even household goods such as televisions.

Why is there a shortage?

It’s a classic case of supply and demand. With the pandemic forcing people around the world to work from home not to mention kids doing classes online the demand for technology items like laptops monitors webcams and microphones ramped up.

However semiconductor manufacturers assumed demand would decline as other industries (including automotive) slowed due to pandemic restrictions.

The majority of semiconductors are produced in Taiwan South Korea and China and those countries have been impacted as badly as anywhere else by COVID-19 and took time to recover.

By the time those plants were fully operational there was a major gulf between the demand for semiconductors and the available supply across so many manufacturers.

The Semiconductor Industry Association reported that demand for its product increased by 6.5 per cent in 2020 amid all the various shutdowns around the world.

The time taken to produce chips - some can take months from start to finish - combined with the long lead times to ramp up production has left manufacturing industries around the world in a difficult position.

What do semiconductors have to do with cars?

The problem for the car industry is complicated. For starters many brands began cutting back on their semiconductor orders early in the pandemic anticipating reduced sales. On the contrary car sales remained strong as people either wanted to avoid public transport or splurge on a new car instead of holidaying.

While all industries have been impacted by this chip shortage the difficulty for the automotive industry is that cars don’t rely on just one type of semiconductor it needs both the latest versions for things like infotainment as well as less-advanced ones for components like power windows.

Despite this car makers are actually relatively small customers compared to the likes of tech giants like Apple and Samsung so they haven’t been given priority resulting in further problems.

The issue wasn’t helped by a fire at one of Japan’s largest chip producers in March this year. The damage caused to the factory stopped production for approximately a month further reducing global supply.

What impact has it had on the car industry?

Every car maker has been impacted by the semiconductor shortage although exactly how badly is hard to determine accurately as the crisis is ongoing. What we do know is that it has affected most brands’ ability to produce cars and will continue to cause supply constraints for some time to come.

Even the biggest manufacturers aren’t immune with Volkswagen Group Ford General Motors Hyundai Motor Group and Stellantis all forced to slow production around the world.

Volkswagen CEO Herbert Diess was quoted saying his group had been unable to build approximately 100000 cars due to a lack of semiconductors.

General Motors was forced to idle factories in the US Canada and Mexico earlier this year and some are still not back online at one stage the American giant predicted this crisis would cost it US$2 billion.

Most brands have opted to focus what semiconductors they can get into the most profitable models; for example GM has prioritised production of its pick-ups and large SUVs over less profitable models and niche products such as the Chevrolet Camaro which has been out of production since May and isn’t due to resume until late August.

Having been troubled by the chip shortage for over a year some brands are now considering more drastic action. Jaguar Land Rover recently admitted that it’s considering cutting certain pieces of equipment from models in order to get the rest of the car built.

That means buyers may have to decide if they want their new car sooner and compromise on specification or be patient and wait for the chip shortage to end so all equipment can be included.

The knock-on effect of this production slowdown is limited supply and delivery delays. In Australia the situation was exacerbated by an already slow first half of 2020 due to the recession and the pandemic only restricted supply more.

While there are signs of recovery in Australia with sales returning to pre-pandemic levels car prices remain higher than average as dealers are limited in the stock they can secure.

When will it end?

That depends on who you listen to with some predicting we’ve been through the worst of the shortage and others warning it could drag on into 2022.

Volkswagen’s head of procurement Murat Aksel told Reuters in June that he predicts the worst period will be over by the end of July.

On the contrary at the time of publication other industry experts are tipping that the supply shortage could actually worsen in the second half of 2021 and create further production delays for car makers.

Stellantis boss Carlos Tavares told reporters this week that he doesn’t expect supply to return to pre-pandemic levels until well into 2022.

What’s the solution to increase supply and stop it happening again?

I know this is an automotive website but the reality is this semiconductor shortage is actually a complex geo-political issue that requires the highest levels of government and business to work together to find a solution.

What the crisis has done is highlight that semiconductor production is centred around Asia -as mentioned earlier the bulk of these chips are produced in Taiwan China and South Korea. That makes life difficult for European and US car makers as it has restricted their ability to secure increased supply in a highly competitive global industry.

As a result world leaders have become involved in this semiconductor issue and pledged to help find a solution.

US president Joe Biden has said his country needs to stop being so reliant on other countries and needs to secure its supply chain for the future. Exactly what that means is difficult to quantify because ramping up manufacturing technical items like semiconductors isn’t the work of a moment.

In February President Biden ordered a 100-day review of global supply chains to try and find a solution to the semiconductor shortage.

In April he met with more than 20 industry executives to discuss his plan to invest US$50 billion into semiconductor production those included GM’s Mary Barry Ford’s Jim Farley and Tavares as well as the likes of Sundar Pichai of Alphabet (Google’s parent company) and representatives from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and Samsung.

The US President is not alone in his concern either. In May German chancellor Angela Merkel told an innovation summit that Europe is putting its key industries in danger if it cannot secure its supply chain.

“If a big bloc like the EU is not in position to create chips I am not comfortable about that” Chancellor Merkel said. ""It is not good if you are a car nation and you can't produce the core component.”

China is reportedly focused on producing as much as 70 per cent of the microchips it needs for its own industries made in the country within the next five years to ensure it has what it needs.

But it’s not just governments making moves several car makers are also being proactive in their efforts to secure. Last month Reuters reported that Hyundai Motor Group had engaged with South Korean chip manufacturers to discuss a long-term solution that would stop this problem happening again.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9uZXd5b3JrL25ld3MvMjAyMS8wNy8yNC9yZW50YWwtY2FyLXNob3J0YWdlLWxhYm9yLXNlbWljb25kdWN0b3Itc2hpcHBpbmcuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3 reasons why it's so difficult to rent a car right now — and what comes next - New York Business Journal,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.bizjournals.com/newyork/news/2021/07/24/rental-car-shortage-labor-semiconductor-shipping.html on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9uZXd5b3JrL25ld3MvMjAyMS8wNy8yNC9yZW50YWwtY2FyLXNob3J0YWdlLWxhYm9yLXNlbWljb25kdWN0b3Itc2hpcHBpbmcuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZXNtb2luZXNyZWdpc3Rlci5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy8yMDIxLzA3LzI0L2J1eWluZy1jYXItdXNlZC1uYWRhLXNvdXRoZWFzdC1pb3dhLXdoeS10aGV5cmUtaGFyZC1maW5kLWF1dG9tb3RpdmUtaW5kdXN0cnktY292aWQtMTktc2VtaWNvbmR1Y3Rvci84MDQ1MDEzMDAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Buying a car in southeast Iowa?

However the biggest grosses came from local pics in China where upcoming release dates for Hollywood continue to be a frustrating question mark.

Getting to the studios first in a 23-market rollout Universal’s M Night Shyamalan time-twister Old grossed $6.5M for a $23M global debut. Paramount’s Snake Eyes: GI Joe Origins for its part rolled a $4M start from 37 markets which rep 29% of the overseas footprint. The global total on Snake Eyes is $17.4M through Sunday.

Another snake led the international box office overall however as Alibaba’s animated sequel White Snake 2: The Tribulation Of The Green Snake (aka Green Snake) grossed an estimated $29.8M in its opening Middle Kingdom frame. The film centered on an ancient Chinese legend included $2.6M from IMAX which was 9.1% of the national total and the highest IMAX indexing ever for a local animated film in the market. Green Snake was followed by Chinese Doctors at $17M for a $176M cume to date.

While there is market upheaval around the globe — from closures in South East Asia to France’s requirement of vaccination status and Australia having a gigantic swath of shuttered cinemas — Chinese movie theaters have remained essentially unscathed since reopening last year. And yet of late the market is rather more confounding than usual. Uni’s F9 and Par’s A Quiet Place Pat II were given May dates while Sony’s Peter Rabbit 2 joined in June — since then bupkes. July was expected to be a blackout period for imports and we had heard that could stretch into August which now appears to be the case. There are no major Hollywood movies on the docket — and a date for Black Widow seems ever more elusive; a real shame for a market that loves Marvel. We understand that importation certificates have been scarce for studio movies and there is as yet no clear plan ahead for such films as Warner Bros’ Space Jam 2: A New Legacy or Disney’s Jungle Cruise — both of which having aspects that would lend themselves to appeal in China.

July has not been a banner month for Chinese movies — propaganda films released for the 100th anniversary of the founding of the communist party underwhelmed — and the market surely needs and benefits from its local hits. But to maintain its growth (Covid or not) it also needs studio muscle. There are a handful of homegrown titles coming up which have recently been added to the calendar including action/crime pic Raging Fire starring Donnie Yen on July 30 and youth drama Up Coming on August 13.

Still those titles were confirmed rather suddenly and this has got to be difficult for local exhibitors who have had release dates sprung upon them willy-nilly in recent months. One movie that was expected this summer The Battle At Lake Changjin with The Wandering Earth and Wolf Warrior movies’ Wu Jing we hear has been moved off the summer slate.

It’s not clear what’s next but certainly even if the studios recoup only 25% of the box office from China it seems a waste for both parties to have a shut-out on Hollywood.

Turning back to the overall weekend numbers: Old was the biggest new opener for Hollywood this session overseas with $6.5M from 23 markets and including a strong No. 1 start in Russia at $2.1M and well above comps. Snake Eyes was No. 3 in Russia at $685K while No. 1 in the UAE and Singapore.

In holdovers Disney/Marvel’s Black Widow held well during the mid-weeks although it is suffering from a lack of South East Asian markets. The total 3rd weekend drop was 52% internationally for a $14.5M take in 48 markets. The international total is now $160.1M for $315M global.

Warner Bros’ Space Jam: A New Legacy which like Black Widow; should normally have a China date by now added $12.6M from 66 markets. The overseas cume is $42.6M with $94M worldwide. The holdover drop was terrific at -37% and in like-for-likes the film is tracking 74% over Tom & Jerry which also released during the pandemic.

And then there’s stalwart F9. Universal’s latest entry in the saga drove well past $600M worldwide this session to cume $621.3M. That’s the first Hollywood movie to the mark since 2019 Christmas release Jumanji: The Next Level got there in January 2020. The offshore weekend was $11.6M hampered in part by the health pass requirement in France. The overseas total is $457.9M.

This week Disney’s Jungle Cruise starts overseas rollout in essentially the same suite as Black Widow a few weeks ago. The Dwayne Johnson/Emily Blunt-starrer will be playing on 750 IMAX screens in 65 markets including North America UK Russia France Japan South Korea Mexico and Brazil. Warner Bros/DC’s The Suicide Squad is going early in some offshore markets including the UK and France.

Breakdowns on this weekend’s films above and more have been updated below.

NEW

OLD

Universal M Night Shyamalan’s latest did $6.5M in 23 new markets this session taking a total $23M in its global opening. The Universal release was No. 1 in Russia coming in at $2.1M seven times bigger than The Visit and three times above The Happening. The UK was next best at $1.1M for third place followed by Mexico at $800K and Italy’s No. 1 $600K repping the second best start for a pandemic-era horror title. France rounds out the Top 5 with $500K. The market is in severe upheaval as it last week became mandatory to show a health pass proving vaccination status in order to attend cinemas. Brazil Germany Spain Korea and Japan are still to release Old. Shyamalan’s films tend to perform best in the European majors as well as Mexico Australia and Brazil.

SNAKE EYES: GI JOE ORIGINS

Paramount Paramount’s Henry Golding-starrer launched in just 29% of the offshore landscape with Russia leading at $685K for third place. In total the Robert Schwentke-directed spinoff grossed $4M from 37 markets including a No. 1 in the UAE at $512K from 68 locations and a No. 1 in Singapore with $110K from 33. Australia which is hampered by more than 60% of cinemas being closed came in at $230K from 139. Mexico which typically leans into this type of fare grossed $330K from 829 including previews. A number of states moved to a higher Covid alert in Mexico over the weekend which has impacted moviegoing.

HOLDOVERS

BLACK WIDOW

Disney Disney/Marvel’s Black Widow has now grossed $315M globally with a 52% drop in 48 international markets. Mid-weeks were solid (Monday-Wednesday were flat) and the weekend drew $14.5M for an overseas cume of $160.1M. Korea where the film is only available in cinemas is the top overall market at $23.1M. It’s still No. 1 there. In the UK the drop was 24% for a $19M cume. Affecting all play South East Asia remains closed outside Singapore. Rounding out the Top 5 are France ($12.9M) Mexico ($8.9M) and Australia ($8.6M). Disney is still listing China as TBD although as noted above it’s still anybody’s guess if the movie gets a release there. The IMAX cume for Black Widow is $19.1M global.

SPACE JAM 2: A NEW LEGACY

Warner Bros The Warner Bros sequel (also awaiting a China date) added $12.6M from 66 overseas markets for a $42.6M international cume and $94M worldwide. The drop was just 37% while the UK saw a 3% increase (last weekend having been impacted by nice weather). In new play Spain debuted Space Jam 2 at No. 1 with $1.3M to land well ahead of such comps as Croods 2 Lego Movie 2 Tom & Jerry and Peter Rabbit 2. France was also a launch market with $1M although the health pass introduction was a factor. Australia currently leads all play with $7.3M followed by Mexico ($5.6M) UK ($5M) Russia ($2.6M) and New Zealand ($2.1M).

In like-for-likes the LeBron James-starrer is running 74% above WB’s pandemic-era release Tom & Jerry. Still to come are such markets as Japan and Italy.

F9

Universal Universal’s F9 crossed $600M worldwide this session becoming the first Hollywood movie to do so since 2019 release Jumanji: The Next Level got there in January 2020. The overseas weekend was good for $11.6M (-56%) and lifts the international cume to $457.9M globally the Vin Diesel-starrer is at $621.3M.

Chile and Uruguay scored the biggest openings of the pandemic while Germany had a -42% second weekend hold and is running above Hobbs & Shaw at the same point of release with $12.1M to date. The 84% second week France drop highlights the issues caused by the health pass requirement. The cume there is $12.5M. Japan is still to come on August 6 while 11 markets have surpassed the lifetime of Hobbs & Shaw including Brazil Mexico Australia and Russia.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9tb3ZpZXMvbW92aWUtbmV3cy9vbGQtYm94LW9mZmljZS1zbmFrZS1leWVzLTEyMzQ5ODc3MTEv0gFdaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaG9sbHl3b29kcmVwb3J0ZXIuY29tL21vdmllcy9tb3ZpZS1uZXdzL29sZC1ib3gtb2ZmaWNlLXNuYWtlLWV5ZXMtMTIzNDk4NzcxMS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Box Office: ‘Old’ Slithers Past ‘Snake Eyes’ to Top Slow Weekend With $16.5M,"M. Night Shyamalan is scoring another No. 1 at the domestic box office where his thriller Old is slithering past fellow new offering Snake Eyes: G.I. Joe Origins to win an overall quiet weekend.

Old — about a family whose tropical vacation turns into an age-accelerating nightmare — took in $16.5 million from 3555 locations. The psychological thriller starring Gael García Bernal and Vicky Krieps was inspired by the graphic novel Sandcastle.

Old distributed by Universal debuted to $6.5 million internationally from 23 markets for a worldwide start of $23 million.

Paramount and Hasbro’s Snake Eyes: G.I. Joe Origins starring Henry Golding came in second with an estimated $13.4 million from 3521 locations. Overseas it debuted to $4 million from 37 markets for a global launch of $17.8 million.

In normal times Snake Eyes — which had hoped to relaunch an important franchise for Hasbro and Paramount — would have been expected to do far more business. It opened well behind the first two films in the franchise based on the Hasbro toy. G.I. Joe: Rise of Cobra debuted domestically to $54 million in 2009 while 2013’s G.I. Joe: Retaliation started with $40 million.

Snake Eyes‘ performance is no doubt a major disappointment for the filmmakers as the box office recovery continues to plod along. The movie — costing a reported $88 million to make before marketing — skewed heavily male (60 percent).

And while Old marks the seventh time that a Shyamalan movie has opened at No. 1 it is still the lowest nationwide start for the director-writer supplanting The Lady in the Water ($18 million). Old cost Shyamalan — who puts together the financing for his own films — a relatively modest $18 million to make before marketing.

The wild swings at the box office — as well as relatively low openings for many movies in comparison to the past — reflect that moviegoing has yet to reach pre-pandemic levels (both Old or Snake Eyes weren’t tracking to do huge numbers). And in recent days the Delta variant has further complicated matters.

Circumstances in a raft of foreign markets are even more challenging. Old grossed just $500000 from France where cinemas are now requiring vaccine passports. As a result box office revenue at the French box office tumbled 60 percent from last weekend. There are also cinema closures in Australia and heightened restrictions in Mexico.

Box office pundits are hopeful that next weekend’s Disney tentpole Jungle Cruise starring Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt will boost moviegoing followed by Marvel and DC’s Suicide Squad sequel in early August.

In North America Old and Snake Eyes claimed the top two spots on the box office chart ahead of Warner Bros.’ Space Jam: A New Legacy which — like many other event pics that are debuting simultaneously in the home — fell steeply in its second weekend.

The family movie is playing on HBO Max at no extra charge while Black Widow — now in its third weekend — is streaming on Disney+ Premier Access for an additional $30. (Black Widow fell 68 percent in its second weekend.)

Black Widow redeemed itself this weekend to some degree beating Space Jam 2 with $11.6 million and becoming the fastest film of the pandemic era to cross $150 million in North America. The stand-alone superhero film finished Sunday with a domestic tally of $154.8 million and $314.9 million globally including another $14.5 million offshore for the weekend. (The company did not reveal updated Disney+ Premier Access numbers.)

Space Jam 2 from Warner Bros. dropped 69 percent to $9.7 million for a 10-day domestic total of $51.4 million. The family pic earned $12.6 million overseas from 66 markets for a tepid foreign tally of $42.6 million and $94 million globally.

At the specialty box office Joe Bell starring Mark Wahlberg debuted to $707185 theaters the worst wide launch of Wahlberg’s career. Roadside Attractions is distributing the troubled film domestically.

Joe Bell was beat by Focus and CNN Films’ Roadrunner: A Film About Anthony Bourdain which earned $830000 in its second weekend from 954 theaters for a domestic tally of $3.7 million.

One bright spot: In a second win of the weekend for Universal F9 has become the first Hollywood event pic in the pandemic era to zoom past the $600 million mark at the worldwide box office. The tentpole received an exclusive theatrical release and was among the few Hollywood event films of late to get a release in China before the traditional summer blackout barring Western films kicked in.

In the aftermath of Paramount Pictures’ announcement that it is seeking an actor to play the role of Bob Marley some Reggae fans are demanding that one of his children or grandchildren preferably Skip Marley assume the character of the late Reggae icon.

A few days ago Paramount Viacom issued a casting call for a black/mixed race actor to star as Bob Marley in an upcoming feature film about the St. Ann native. The film which is to be directed by Reinaldo Marcus Green will focus on Marley’s life and career.

“A pioneer of reggae music and a Jamaican icon we follow the Jamaican singer songwriter and musician’s life and career. He was a man full of fight soul and pride. He infused his music with a sense of spirituality and political activism striving to leave a global impact as well as a personal one with the people he loved” the casting call read.

It also asked that interested persons submit a headshot a full-length photo and a one to two-minute introductory video. It also notes that the ability to sing and speak Patois would be “a plus”.

The executive producers of the film will be Marley’s widow Rita his daughter Cedella and his eldest son Ziggy who will produce the movie on behalf of Tuff Gong the music label and studios which was established by Bob in 1970.

Over on Jus’ Jah Magazine’s Instagram page where the advertisement was shared Rastafarians were adamant that nobody except someone from the Marley clan would be suitable to play the role of the Gong.

“@skipmarley him alone can properly portray Bob 😍 man Fava him grand father bad and sound like him too” donzik said of the Slow Down singer.

“Use Skip Marley he looks like him and have some of Bob’s mannerisms” dr.love_ii noted.

Another commenter kiahkills said she would flatly reject the film if a member of the Marley clan was not chosen to play the character of the BBC’s Man of the Century.

“If one of his own children doesn’t play him we don’t want it! Who else could do him justice? No one!” then added: “I lied. Children or grandchildren. Cuz Skip Marley…..😍.”

“He has enough sons for this – who better than his own #authenticity” tr3v23 declared.

Skip who is the son of Bob’s daughter Cedella is a player of the guitar drum and piano. The 25-year-old has received two Grammy Award nominations and an MTV Video Music Award nomination.

The Chained to the Rhythm singer was born in Kingston and raised in Miami Florida. In addition to being the grandson of Bob and Rita he is also the grandnephew of another Reggae icon – Marcia Griffiths.

He made his debut as a singer in 2015 at age 18 with the single Cry to Me on the Tuff Gong International label.

In March Deadline reported that “following a lengthy search Paramount had appointed King Richard’s Reinaldo Marcus Green to direct its Bob Marley movie for the studio”.

The Deadline article also quoted Ziggy Marley as saying that the film would be paying homage to his father in a manner that has never been undertaken before. “I am very excited to be hands-on in working to dive deeper into sharing the legacy of who our father Bob Marley is” Ziggy said.

“It’s an incredible responsibility that we take on with Reinaldo and the team at Paramount to tell the story of our father in a way that truly honors him and will also entertain enlighten uplift and inspire his fans and audiences around the world. It’s like opening a window that has never been open before.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbmRpYWdsaXR6LmNvbS9hc2hpa2EtYWFubmFuZC1hY2NpZGVudC1zZXJpb3VzbHktaW5qdXJlZC1ob3NwaXRhbGl6ZWQtZnJpZW5kLXZhbGlzZXR0eS1iaGF2YW5pLWRlYXRoLXRhbWlsLW5ld3MtMjkxNjE10gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Yashika Aannand seriously injured friend dies in freak midnight accident - Tamil News,"Yashika Aannand has been hospitalized after sustaining serious injuries when the car she was traveling in met with a freak accident.

According to Variety the former animated series will debut in the US this fall while the latter returns to the streamer on August 12.

'Prodigy' is the first 'Star Trek' series aimed at younger audiences. It will follow a motley crew of young aliens who must figure out how to work together while navigating a greater galaxy in search of a better future. At the beginning of this show the six young outcasts know nothing about the starship they've commandeered of which the trailer provides a glimpse. But over the course of their adventures together each will be introduced to Starfleet and the ideals it represents.

Emmy winners Kevin and Dan Hageman have developed 'Prodigy'. The show is produced by CBS Studios' Eye Animation Productions Secret Hideout Roddenberry Entertainment and the Nickelodeon Animation Studio. The trailer also unveiled the first look at that starship which is not as the show's title might suggest named 'Prodigy'. Instead a close look revealed it's named to be 'U.S.S. Protostar'.

Its registry number started with NX instead of NCC indicating that the 'Protostar' is an experimental ship rather than a fully commissioned starship. How and why it came to be abandoned are mysteries that the show will explore. Alex Kurtzman Heather Kadin Katie Krentz Rod Roddenberry and Trevor Roth are executively producing it alongside the Hagemans who serve as showrunners. Ben Hibon will direct the show directs along with co-executive producing it. Aaron Baiers also serves as co-executive producer.

The new Paramount plus Original's voice cast includes Kate Mulgrew Brett Gray Ella Purnell Angus Imrie Rylee Alazraqui Dee Bradley Baker and Jason Mantzoukas among others. The trailer for 'Star Trek: Lower Decks' which is an adult animated show developed by Mike McMahan was unveiled following the 'Prodigy' panel. The half-hour comedy series centres on the support crew of the U.S.S. Cerritos one of Starfleet's least important ships.

Returning for its second season the show will be ""bigger"" and ""funnier"" with an enjoyable mix of ""silly"" and ""serious"" Trek as per McMahan. ""It's just a blast"" he said. Fans can expect strange new (and familiar) aliens to challenge the crews of the U.S.S. Cerritos and the U.S.S. Titan. 'Lower Decks' is produced by CBS Studios' Eye Animation Productions Secret Hideout and Roddenberry Entertainment. Creator-showrunner McMahan has executive produced it alongside Secret Hideout's Alex Kurtzman Heather Kadin and Aaron Baiers Roddenberry Entertainment's Rod Roddenberry and Trevor Roth and Katie Krentz for 219 Productions.

The show's voice cast includes Tawny Newsome Jack Quaid Eugene Cordero Noel Wells Jerry O'Connell and others. 'Prodigy' EPs Kevin and Dan Hageman joined director/co-EP Hibon for a conversation as part of the panel which also featured voice actors Mulgrew Gray Purnell Imrie Alazraqui Baker and Mantzoukas.

The 'Lower Decks' panel featured creator showrunner and EP McMahan along with voice actors Newsome Quaid and Cordero. O'Connell moderated both conversations. (ANI)

PYPL,PayPal,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzA3LzI0L3dpbGwtc3F1YXJlLWJlLXdvcnRoLW1vcmUtdGhhbi1wYXlwYWwtYnktMjAyNS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Will Square Be Worth More Than PayPal by 2025?,"Could the ambitious fintech company overtake the market leader?

Square (SQ 2.90%) and PayPal (PYPL 1.00%) have both generated massive returns for patient investors over the past few years. Square went public at $9 per share in late 2015 and it's now trading at around $260. PayPal which was spun off from eBay (EBAY 1.31%) earlier that year has advanced more than 720% since its debut to over $300 per share.

Square is worth nearly $120 billion as of this writing while PayPal is worth over $350 billion. That isn't surprising since PayPal still serves a much larger audience and operates in more countries than Square. But gazing into the future could Square eventually match -- or even surpass -- PayPal's valuation by 2025? Let's examine both fintech companies' growth trajectories and valuations to find out.

Wild ambitions vs. stable growth

Square and PayPal's core business models are similar. Both companies charge businesses flat fees which vary by platform and transaction type to process payments. Both companies offer small business loans. Square's Cash App and PayPal's Venmo both enable consumers to make peer-to-peer payments and both companies provide branded debit cards that are linked to users' online accounts.

But Square has been willing to take bolder risks than PayPal over the past few years. It expanded its services ecosystem with online payroll management services and analytics tools and recently launched a full suite of online banking services. Square also added Bitcoin (BTC 2.78%) purchases to its Cash App in 2018 added free stock trades to the app to challenge Robinhood in 2019 and plans to add Credit Karma's tax filing services to its ecosystem in the near future.

PayPal only started offering cryptocurrency trades last October and it doesn't have any near-term plans to launch stock trading tools or dedicated tax filing services or expand into a full-blown online bank like Square. Simply put Square seems to have wilder and grander ambitions than PayPal.

Which company is growing faster?

Between 2015 and 2020 Square grew its annual revenue at a CAGR of 49.6%. Excluding its massive gain in Bitcoin revenue last year it would still have grown its revenue at a CAGR of 31.2% over the past five years. PayPal's annual revenue grew at a CAGR of 18.5% between 2015 and 2020. Let's take a look at Wall Street's expectations for both companies over the next two years.

Company Estimated Sales Growth

(FY 2021) Estimated Sales Growth

(FY 2022) Square 110.6% 14.1% PayPal 20.6% 21.5%

Analysts expect Square's Bitcoin revenue to continue rising this year before cooling off next year. They also expect its growth in transaction-based and seller service revenue which slowed down during the pandemic to recover as more businesses reopen. The Cash App which grew its monthly active users 50% to 36 million in 2020 should also keep expanding as Square adds new services.

Cathie Wood's ARK Invest expects Square's transaction-based and seller service revenues to grow at a CAGR of 19% through 2025. It also expects the Cash App's MAUs to more than double to 75 million for Square to monetize roughly 40% of those users and for its average revenue per Cash App user to grow from $25 in 2019 to $260 in 2025 -- which would represent a whopping CAGR of 49%.

PayPal's growth should remain more predictable since it doesn't generate significant revenue from cryptocurrencies yet. Instead it will mainly rely on its growth in active accounts which rose 21% year-over-year to 392 million last quarter to generate stable revenue from its processing fees.

PayPal expects to nearly double its active accounts to 750 million and more than double its annual revenue to over $50 billion by 2025. It also plans to grow its earnings at a CAGR of 22% from 2020 to 2025. It believes the rising acceptance of QR codes and NFC payments the expansion of its financial services and higher engagement rates for its apps will all drive that long-term growth.

Will Square be worth more than PayPal by 2025?

In a best-case scenario ARK Invest believes Square's stock could hit $500 per share by 2025 if it hits its growth targets. But unlike PayPal Square hasn't provided any concrete targets of its own yet.

If Square hits $500 and its valuations hold steady it could be worth just over $200 billion by 2025. Meanwhile if PayPal achieves its goals of more than doubling its annual revenue and growing its EPS at a CAGR of 22% through 2025 its stock could easily double and boost its market cap to $700 billion.

Therefore it's doubtful that Square -- which already trades at higher valuations than PayPal -- will be the more valuable company by 2025. But that doesn't mean PayPal is necessarily a better growth stock than Square. I personally own Square instead of PayPal because I admire its ambitious and forward-thinking strategies. Both stocks are still great long-term investments on the booming fintech market so investors shouldn't fret too much over which company has the higher market cap.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNlYXR0bGV0aW1lcy5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvYnJlYWtpbmctdXAtd2l0aC12ZW5tby10aGUtYmVzdC1wYXltZW50LWFwcHMtZm9yLXByaXZhY3ktYW5kLWxvdy1mZWVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Breaking up with Venmo: The best payment apps for privacy and low fees,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.seattletimes.com', port=443): Read timed out.

Twitch streamer Froste confirmed in a Tweet on Sunday that he plans to file a lawsuit against PayPal after the company reportedly banned his account following a $95000 donation during a charity subathon for Gamers Outreach on Wednesday. At the time of banning his PayPal account had nearly $65000 which is now being blocked from withdrawal for at least 180-days.

The streamer published a Tweet on Wednesday showing the banned account with $64238 USD inside it. In a reply to that Tweet he told PayPal ""Please message me privately in my direct messages before the end of the weekend or my lawyer will! Thank you!""

After waiting several days PayPal support responded by permanently banning him from their service and informing him he will have to wait 180 days before withdrawing any money.

""We appreciate your interest in PayPal and I'm sorry to hear that we've made the decision to no longer offer you access to our services"" the company representative stated. ""This isn't something we do lightly and I can assure you that we fully review all factors on an account before making this type of decision. . . If there is any balance in the account that would be held up for 180 days. This is to minimize any potential risk of loss due to disputes or chargebacks that may be filed during that period. Once that timeframe has elapsed you'll be notified that you can withdraw any balances.""

In response the streamer had some unsavory words for the PayPal rep and then said on Twitter ""Court is it I guess.""

Many Twitter users joined Frost in being outraged by PayPal's announcement with several pointing out that they are blocking a donation for Gamer's Outreach a 501 nonprofit organization dedicated to helping kids in hospitals cope with their treatments.

The donation in question came during Froste's charity subathon that has been running for more than nine days as of writing this article. He shattered his initial funding goals and currently has 695 hours left on the timer but the subathon is uncapped so it could continue to go up.

There were also many who pointed out that a sudden $95000 transfer would justifiably raise flags for PayPal and that perhaps it would be better to directly contact PayPal rather than DMing them on Twitter.

""I used to work for PayPal back in 2016 and from what I remember they have a whole hidden system called Risk where if something happens out of the norm on the account it shoots up a red flag"" asserted Reddit user GenericTwitchViwer. ""It usually happens with account where they usually did like small transactions and then had one really big one kinda like this because I doubt he's ever gotten a straight $95000 transfer to his account. Yeah it's inconvenient but it makes sense and the right course of action would be calling them and getting the issue resolved not telling them to DM him on Twitter.""

Another group pointed out that the unfortunate situation unfolding for Froste is one of the reasons why it is best not to run charity streams from your personal accounts.

""This is yet another reason why you don't use your own accounts to run charity streams""

Reddit user Willitrom argued ""It's much easier to get a charity to sign up for tiltify or softgiving or similar than it is to both get paypal to treat your sudden increase in donations as legitimate and get the government you're living under to not tax them as income.""

The couple decided to start up as they were not satisfied in their corporate career. What started as One MobiKwik Systems to offer small-ticket mobile recharges is now one of the largest IPO-bound digital payments companies in the country.





MobiKwik claims to be having one million daily transactions across its network which include digital wallets and services like mobile phone top-ups and utility bill payments. Over three million merchants are on its network and it serves over 107 million users.

The turning point

After finishing schooling from Surat Upasana went to Punjab for her BTech and then flew to the US to pursue Management Science & Engineering from Stanford University. After her master’s she donned many hats ranging from marketing and outreach to forecast and market research and worked in companies like PayPal and HSBC.





However by 2008 she realised she no longer wanted to work in the corporate sector. In an earlier conversation with YourStory she said the satisfaction was not there.

“I wanted to come back to India and contribute to the ecosystem back home” she said.

Upasana returned to India by early 2009 and started networking. She learnt that a wallet like PayPal was unheard of in India as users couldn’t imagine a cashless world then.





Serendipitously during this time she happened to meet Bipin Preet Singh through a mutual friend. An IIT Delhi graduate Bipin had previously worked in companies like Intel Nvidia and Freescale. He was eager to startup in the same space too.

While working at Freescale he felt impatient and restless he had shared in an earlier conversation with YourStory.

“I realised the job was not challenging enough even though it paid well. Also the idea of a gradual rise to managerial job did not appeal to me. I had two options - either do an MBA or start something on my own. I figured that starting up is cheaper and more fun” he said.

Bipin Singh foresaw a future where people would start making use of their mobile phones to make their payments and started “One MobiKwik Systems” with the vision to create an online store where all the needs of mobile owners can be satisfied. These include three major verticals: Voice Data and Applications.





While Bipin had already taken the plunge with MobiKwik Upasana was testing the waters and helping him with certain aspects of the business. Six months down her confidence in the idea grew and MobiKwik had started gaining traction. So she joined MobiKwik full-time as its co-founder.

No looking back

By late 2011 they were renting their first office in Dwarka Delhi that had five rooms. In September 2012 the company applied for RBI’s PPI licence and received it in July 2013.





The investor community didn’t fail to notice its growth. In 2014 their first round of funding was worth $5 million which helped them move to a much larger office in Udyog Vihar Gurugram with over 50 employees. By then they had expanded their payments network to many offline and online merchants and the funding rounds kept going and there has been no looking back.

Taking the IPO route

The digital payments startup filed for an initial public offering in July to raise Rs 1900 crore its draft red herring prospectus (DRHP) showed. The IPO will reportedly launch in September this year.

The Gurugram-based startup had told YourStory in February that it was gearing up for an IPO this year after clocking its highest-ever revenue in March 2020. But the pandemic pressured its bottomline and the startup had to lower its revenue expectations to around Rs 400 crore and a loss between Rs 40 crore and Rs 50 crore Upasana told YourStory in the video interview."

The agreement which was ratified in a vote that one union official described as close puts an end to what workers at the Frito-Lay plant in Topeka Kan. call “suicide shifts” — back-to-back 12-hour shifts with only an eight-hour break in between.

“The outcome of this strike was a testament to the tenacity and grit of the Frito-Lay workers in Topeka” Anthony Shelton international president of the Bakery Confectionery Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers International Union which represents the employees who are members of Local 218 said in a statement.

The workers in Local 218 said they went on strike because the company had refused to address their concerns about the shifts which they said took away time with their families and did not even allow enough time to get a full night’s sleep.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9pc2xhbmRwYWNrZXQvbmFtZS9seWxlLWJsYWlyLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTEzOTk3NTcz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lyle Blair Obituary (1930 - 2021) - Hilton Head Island SC - The Island Packet,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/islandpacket/name/lyle-blair-obituary?id=13997573 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9pc2xhbmRwYWNrZXQvbmFtZS9seWxlLWJsYWlyLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTEzOTk3NTcz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMS8wNy8yMy91cy9mcml0by1sYXktc3RyaWtlLXRvcGVrYS1rYW5zYXMtdHJuZC9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFJaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyMS8wNy8yMy91cy9mcml0by1sYXktc3RyaWtlLXRvcGVrYS1rYW5zYXMtdHJuZA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why hundreds of Frito-Lay workers have been striking,"CNN —

Workers at the Frito-Lay plant in Topeka Kansas say it used to be one of the best jobs in town – a place of shared meals group outings and community.

In recent years though employees and union members say the facility where Doritos Cheetos and Tostitos are made has become another toxic work environment.

Hundreds of Frito-Lay workers at the Topeka facility are in week three of a strike over what union leaders describe as long hours forced overtime stagnating wages and a diminished quality of life. It’s the first strike at the plant in its decades of operation.

Members of the Bakery Confectionery Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers Local 218 union have called on the snack food company to provide better working conditions and pay. Among their grievances are so-called “suicide shifts” in which employees work a full eight-hour day plus four hours of overtime with little turnaround time before the next shift.

“Workers do not have enough time to see their family do chores around the house run errands or even get a healthy night’s sleep” the union’s international president Anthony Shelton said in a July 12 statement. “This strike is about working people having a voice in their futures and taking a stand for their families.”

Frito-Lay which is owned by PepsiCo said in a statement that the claims about long hours were “grossly exaggerated.” It also pointed to a contract offer it made prior to the strike that would cap overtime limits at 60 hours and end what it referred to as “squeeze shifts.”

Corrina Christensen communications director for the main Bakery Confectionery Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers union told CNN on Thursday that negotiations had concluded and that it would not comment further until after a vote by members. Frito-Lay did not address specific requests for comment by CNN instead pointing to public statements released this week.

Workers feel they’re being ‘pushed to the edge’

As the nation continues to recover from the pandemic PepsiCo recently reported quarterly earnings that surpassed Wall Street estimates – Frito-Lay North America saw its organic revenue grow by 6%.

Workers at the Topeka plant however feel burned out.

Union leaders said in a podcast interview last week that they had asked management for years to address staffing shortages that resulted in forced overtime and long shifts but that the issues were not adequately addressed.

“Before we walked out on the strike they were 100 employees short already which is where a lot of the overtime comes in” said Paul Klemme chief steward of Local 218.

Mark McCarter a Frito-Lay employee and union representative who has been working at the Topeka facility for more than three decades told VICE that he makes $20.50 an hour despite his long career with the company and hasn’t received a proper raise in 10 years.

“I think people are pushed to the edge” he told the outlet. “COVID created some of this. During COVID managers got to work from home. People see that and realize they have other options. Everyone’s hiring and raising their pay because no one wants to work for $8 an hour anymore.”

Cherie Renfro another worker at the facility criticized Frito-Lay for giving bonuses instead of raises and accused the company of lowering wages for new employees. She also said workers did not receive hazard pay or other recognition for the risks they took throughout the pandemic.

“You have no problem paying for the drug tests background checks orientation and training for 350-plus employees that you hired and lost this past year” Renfro wrote in the Topeka Capital-Journal. “But you have a problem giving decent living wages to keep loyal employees already trained already here.”

More than 800 workers are affected by the strike.

Where things stand

Union membership voted down a July 1 offer made by Frito-Lay before going on strike.

Negotiations resumed this week and on Thursday the two sides concluded their talks.

Frito-Lay said in a statement that the new offer “will better address employee concerns around guaranteed days off and create additional opportunities for the union to have input into staffing and overtime” adding that it would include across-the-board wage increases.

Christensen the spokesperson for the main union said members are currently voting on the contract and that results are expected late Friday.",,,,,,

Women who have had the Pfizer vaccine are reporting an unexpected side effect – claiming their breasts have grown bigger after having the jab.

Pfizer is one of two vaccinations currently being rolled out across Australia in the fight against Covid-19.

Common side effects from Covid-19 vaccines include pain at the injection site headaches fatigue or feeling flu-like symptoms.

But many women have noticed their breasts and lymph nodes had ""swollen"" after receiving their jabs dubbing the effect the ""Pfizer boob job"".

According to Australian Department of Health inflamed lymph nodes are a less common side effect of the vaccinations.

In the US where the vaccination rollout is further along than Australia doctors have reported an influx of newly vaccinated women making mammogram appointments.

Dr. Laura Esserman director of University of California San Francisco's Breast Care Center said women were confusing swollen lymph nodes after the vaccine for signs of cancer.

""I'm sure hundreds of thousands of women will be affected by this for sure"" said Esserman told ABC7 Chicago.

A study published by the Radiological Society of North America recently concluded vaccine-induced lymphadenopathy was an important side effect for clinicians patients and cancer researchers to be aware of as it could result in a false cancer diagnosis.

While it is not clear how long it takes for the swelling in some women's lymph nodes to go down it is important to note it is a ""temporary"" effect.

In Australia women over 50 who require regular mammograms have been advised to either have a mammogram first or delay it until six weeks after vaccination to avoid any confusion.

What causes the swelling?

When people have vaccines in their upper arm it's normal for the lymph nodes in the armpit on that side of the body to be activated and swell. It's your body preparing a protective immune response The Conversation reports.

According to the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists this type of swelling has not been reported with the AstraZeneca vaccine.

Swelling has been recorded in the US with the Moderna vaccine which is currently undergoing approval for use in Australia by the Therapeutic Goods Administration.

'Pfizer boob job' claims

Social media has exploded with reports from women stating their breasts had ""got bigger"" – many wondering if they were imagining their symptoms.

""I feel like my boobs got bigger because of Pfizer or am I just hallucinating"" one wrote on Twitter.

""I can confirm from personal experience that pfizer does indeed make ur boobs grow"" another stated on the social media platform.

While one wrote: ""Can confirm that the pfizer vax makes ur boobs grow ffs.""

Many more shared their shock and delight at the change they've encountered with their body post-vaccination.

On TikTok others have shared videos of their breasts after being vaccinated with a woman in the UK reporting she had gone up two cup sizes from an A to a C.

Elle Marshall went viral after explaining in a video she was ""so confused"" by what was happening to her body as she had been an A cup her whole life.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZveC5jb20vMjAyMS83LzI0LzIyNTkxNTkxL2NvdmlkLXZhY2NpbmUtYm9vc3Rlci1zaG90cy1pbW11bm9jb21wcm9taXNlZC1vbGRlci1hbWVyaWNhbnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Covid-19 booster shots aren’t available yet. Here’s who could need one when they are.,"The Biden administration now believes that fully vaccinated people who are older or immunocompromised may need a booster shot.

Though all three vaccines authorized for use in the United States — Pfizer/BioNTech Moderna and Johnson & Johnson — are highly effective in preventing Covid-19 infections recent data suggests that the efficacy of Pfizer’s two-dose vaccine can wane slightly four to six months after vaccination according to the New York Times.

However a booster shot could lift antibody levels even more substantially than the current two-dose regimen for the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines and could be especially beneficial for people 65 and older and those who are immunocompromised.

People who are immunocompromised may receive significantly less immune protection than the general population after two vaccine doses increasing the upside of a potential third shot.

According to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advisory committee which met earlier this week to discuss the potential need for booster shots about 2.7 percent of the US population is currently immunocompromised in some way whether due to ongoing medical treatment like chemotherapy their status as organ transplant recipients or another reason.

Immunocompromised people are also more likely to become severely ill from Covid-19 and they have a markedly higher chance of experiencing breakthrough infections despite being vaccinated — a concern magnified by a delta variant-fueled resurgence of Covid-19 cases in the US.

10. I am not clear if #ACIP & @CDCgov are legally able to recommend additional doses of #Covid vaccines while @US_FDA's EUAs stipulate the mRNA vaccines are 2-dose vaxes & J&J's is 1 dose. But CDC is making clear it isn't going to move on this till FDA alters the vaxes' status. pic.twitter.com/DMMIU0uKfZ — Helen Branswell (@HelenBranswell) July 22 2021

As things stand data from Pfizer indicates that its vaccine — the first to be authorized in the US and still the most common among US vaccine recipients — declines from 95 percent to 84 percent effectiveness against symptomatic infection after four to six months according to the Times’ Sharon LaFraniere.

Data from Israel where Covid cases are once again rising suggest that an even sharper decline in effectiveness against symptomatic infections is possible — but even then the vaccine remains “more than 90 percent effective in preventing severe disease” and the small sample size means there is still uncertainty about Israel’s findings.

“The goal of this vaccine is not to prevent mild or low moderate infectious disease” Dr. Paul Offit a member of the Food and Drug Administration’s outside advisory committee told the Times. “The goal is to prevent hospitalization to death. Right now this vaccine has held up to that.”

A booster shot administered at the six-month mark could increase antibody levels as much as tenfold according to data released earlier this year by both Pfizer and Moderna underscoring its potential value to older and immunocompromised people.

Israel is already offering a third Pfizer shot for immunocompromised residents — though millions of Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip have yet to be vaccinated — and Pfizer has previously suggested that a booster shot could be needed in the US.

Regulatory questions abound

Though the US currently has tens of millions of surplus Covid-19 vaccine doses on hand making a third Pfizer or Moderna shot available to millions of immunocompromised or elderly Americans likely won’t be a quick process.

Currently all three Covid-19 vaccines in use in the US are being administered under an emergency use authorization or EUA issued by the FDA which sets specific regimens for each vaccine: two doses several weeks apart for both Pfizer and Moderna and a single dose for Johnson & Johnson.

Changing that according to the Washington Post would require either full FDA approval for the vaccine or an amendment to the EUA. And until that happens the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices can’t go forward with recommending a third shot for vulnerable populations in the US.

According to the New York Times “doctors would have vastly more leeway to prescribe a booster for their patients” once the vaccine is fully approved by the FDA.

However there are some potential workarounds to get third shots in arms more quickly. According to Dr. Amanda Cohn chief medical officer for the CDC’s immunization and respiratory diseases center the US is “actively looking into ways ... to potentially provide access earlier than any potential change in regulatory decisions” — including through “a study or through an investigational new drug format.”

As the Washington Post reported after the advisory board meeting earlier this week that strategy could open up access to a third shot under the FDA’s compassionate use program which “would require enrolling individuals in a clinical study where additional doses can be given.”

President Joe Biden also struck an encouraging tone on the prospects for the FDA’s full vaccine approval in coming months at a recent town hall in Cincinnati Ohio.

“They’re [the FDA] not promising me any specific date but my expectation talking to the group of scientists we put together... plus others in the field is that sometime maybe in the beginning of the school year at the end of August beginning September October they’ll get a final approval” Biden told CNN’s Don Lemon on Wednesday.

Full FDA approval requires a massive amount of data including at least six months of vaccine efficacy data and it usually takes about 10 months for the agency to review license applications and reach a decision.

“When we were reviewing applications back when they were on paper there was so much it would not fit on the freight elevator” Norman Baylor the former head of the FDA’s Office of Vaccines Research and Review told CNN. “That’s how big the application is.”

However the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine has already been granted a priority review which shortens the potential timeline to six months and multiple officials have said approval will likely come even sooner potentially clearing the way for booster shots for older and immunocompromised people.

Moderna is currently “in the process of completing our rolling submission” to the FDA according to a Moderna spokesperson and approval for the Moderna vaccine will almost certainly take longer. The company told CNN this week that it has no specific timeline in place yet.

Full FDA approval could also have a number of other benefits in addition to opening up the possibility of booster shots for vulnerable groups. As NBC’s Shannon Pettypiece explained on Tuesday “the official regulatory signoff would remove a significant legal and public relations barrier for businesses and government agencies that want to require vaccinations for their employees and customers” and could also boost vaccine confidence.

Thus far the US has largely held back from imposing vaccine mandates though other countries such as France have embraced them to positive effect.

The delta variant is spreading fast

As the Biden administration consensus coalesces behind the need for a booster shot for vulnerable groups the delta variant of Covid-19 is gaining ground quickly in the US fueling a sharp rise in new cases.

On Saturday the US reported a rolling seven-day average of nearly 50000 cases per day — the highest level since early May according to CNN’s Ryan Struyk and almost 39000 more cases than the same seven-day average in late June.

The United States is now reporting 49386 new coronavirus cases per day the highest seven-day average since May 3 according to data from @CNN and Johns Hopkins University. — Ryan Struyk (@ryanstruyk) July 24 2021

Additionally at a Thursday White House briefing on the pandemic CDC director Dr. Rochelle Walensky warned that the delta variant “now represents more than 83 percent of the virus circulating in the United States.”

“Compared to the virus we had circulating initially in the United States at the start of the pandemic the delta variant is more aggressive and much more transmissible than previously circulating strains” Walensky said. “It is one of the most infectious respiratory viruses we know of and that I have seen in my 20-year career.”

As Vox’s Umair Irfan explained in late June when delta accounted for just 20 percent of new Covid cases in the US the CDC has identified delta as one of five “variants of concern.” Not only does it spread far faster than the original strain of Covid but it’s better at evading vaccine protections and as Irfan reports there’s some evidence that it can cause “more severe outcomes from Covid-19 compared to the original versions of the virus.”

Despite those breakthrough cases however the delta surge is overwhelmingly proving to be “a pandemic of the unvaccinated” as Walensky put it earlier this month. In the US more than 99 percent of recent deaths and about 97 percent of recent hospitalizations from Covid-19 have been among unvaccinated individuals.

As a result this latest virus outbreak has been especially bad in parts of the US with low vaccine uptake such as rural Missouri.

As The Atlantic’s Ed Yong reported from Missouri earlier this month “ICUs are also filling with younger patients in their 20s 30s and 40s including many with no underlying health problems.”

According to Yong

Almost every COVID-19 patient in Springfield’s hospitals is unvaccinated and the dozen or so exceptions are all either elderly or immunocompromised people. The vaccines are working as intended but the number of people who have refused to get their shots is crushing morale. Vaccines were meant to be the end of the pandemic. If people don’t get them the actual end will look more like Springfield’s present: a succession of COVID-19 waves that will break unevenly across the country until everyone has either been vaccinated or infected.

A swath of southern states including Louisiana and Florida are currently reporting more cases per 100000 people than anywhere else in the US with Florida alone contributing more than one-fifth of all new cases in the US.

“Folks [are] supposed to have common sense” Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey a Republican said this week. “But it’s time to start blaming the unvaccinated folks not the regular folks. It’s the unvaccinated folks that are letting us down.”

Currently only 34 percent of Alabamans are fully vaccinated — the worst vaccination rate of the any state in the US along with Mississippi.

Getting vaccinated protects individuals — and the whole community

As of Saturday about 57 percent of the vaccine-eligible population in the US — more than 162 million people — have been fully vaccinated according to data from the CDC. Another 15 million or so more have received at least one dose of the vaccine.

That level of widespread vaccination is unequivocally good news but with US Covid cases on the rise and the delta variant running rampant it invariably also means some of the new Covid cases in the US are “breakthrough infections” — fully vaccinated people nonetheless testing positive for Covid-19.

As Vox’s Umair Irfan explains

The CDC definition of a breakthrough infection is a laboratory-confirmed infection more than 14 days after the final dose of a Covid-19 vaccine as it can take a while for the full protection of a vaccine to spool up. This definition includes everything from infections that produce no symptoms at all to cases that result in death. “People often think about ‘infection’ and ‘disease’ as being the same thing and that is not the case” said Brianne Barker a virologist at Drew University. It’s only when a virus starts causing symptoms that an infected person is said to have disease so not all SARS-CoV-2 infections cause Covid-19. But as we’ve seen throughout the pandemic people can carry and transmit the virus without falling ill themselves creating a major route for the spread of Covid-19. That’s why tracking breakthrough cases is so important.

The good news about breakthrough infections though is that if you’re vaccinated and get sick with Covid-19 you’re far less likely to get severely ill than you would without a vaccine. With a vaccine the chance of hospitalization and death are both reduced compared to unvaccinated individuals according to Dr. Anthony Fauci the United States’ top infectious disease expert.

“If you look at the number of deaths about 99.2 percent of them are unvaccinated. About 0.8 percent are vaccinated” Fauci told NBC’s Chuck Todd on Meet the Press earlier this month. “No vaccine is perfect. But when you talk about the avoidability of hospitalization and death ... it’s really sad and tragic that most all of these are avoidable and preventable.”

Breakthrough infections shouldn't be taken to mean vaccines don’t work; but they SHOULD be taken as even more reason to get that shot in your arm. If everyone was vaccinated there would be far less reason for the virus to spread & fewer people for it to spread btwn. #velshi — Ali Velshi (@AliVelshi) July 24 2021

Currently the country is administering about 537000 doses per day on average down from more than a million per day on average at the start of July — and that dropoff could fuel a brutal self-reinforcing cycle.

Specifically according to Irfan “with vaccination rates slowing reports of people becoming infected after their immunizations could feed vaccine hesitancy which in turn can fuel more breakthrough cases.”

In reality however getting vaccinated actually heads off the risk of further breakthrough infections by making it harder for the virus to spread. And by the same token getting more people vaccinated will also go a long way toward protecting older and immunocompromised people who have already been vaccinated but may now need a booster shot.

The different coronavirus vaccines have one thing in common: They've been met with skepticism by some Americans who have often shared misinformation about their potential side effects.

Many of these false claims center around pregnant women.

""The CDC have been caught manipulating data to justify giving pregnant women the COVID jab"" an image posted July 10 on Instagram says. ""Their study stated just 12% of women suffered a miscarriage after having the jab the actual figure was 82%.""

The image is a screenshot of a July 6 tweet by the Daily Expose a London-based alternative news site that has previously shared misinformation regarding vaccine safety. The tweet was retweeted nearly 2000 times in the first week and the Instagram post has received over 1200 likes since it was posted on July 10.

The post refers to an April 21 study from researchers at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and published by the New England Journal of Medicine.

A similar Instagram post claimed women who got vaccinated within 30 days to 20 weeks of becoming pregnant had an 82% miscarriage rate. The image received more than 6400 likes before it was deleted.

The study researched the safety of COVID-19 vaccines based on messenger RNA or mRNA in pregnant women between Dec. 14 2020 and Feb. 28.

The Instagram user told USA TODAY he shared the image because several women had messaged him ""expressing concerns over changes in their menstrual cycle.""

False claims about the vaccine harming pregnant women aren't new.

USA TODAY has previously debunked other false claims about the vaccine causing infertility in women miscarriages increasing since the vaccine rollout and vaccines causing menstrual cycle changes.

This claim is also wrong.

The study data released so far actually showed only 12.6 % of pregnant women in the study had a miscarriage – not 82%. The study concluded that vaccinations weren't a safety risk for pregnant women.

Fact check:Claim about unvaccinated being sent to quarantine camps started as satire

The Daily Expose along with social media users who've shared the claim reached the errant conclusion by altering the data that scientists used experts say.

Study found no safety concerns in pregnancy caused by vaccines

The study used data from three main data-collecting programs within the CDC: the V-safe Pregnancy Registry the V-safe smartphone tool and the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System or VAERS.

A total of almost 4000 women from the pregnancy registry participated in the study. Of that group 827 participants completed their pregnancy by the end of the study a category that included healthy births miscarriages and any other complications that ended the pregnancy.

Among those 827 completed pregnancies 712 gave birth and 104 had a miscarriage. One case resulted in a stillbirth and 10 resulted in either induced abortion or extrauterine pregnancy.

Those completed pregnancies consisted primarily of women at the very beginning or very end of their terms. The live birth group was of course at the end and the miscarraiges generally occurred among those early on.

Out of the 104 miscarriages 94 occurred within the first 13 weeks of the pregnancy – the first trimester which is when most miscarriages happen according to the Mayo Clinic.

That works out to a miscarriage rate of 12.6%. According to Mayo Clinic that percentage is within the average miscarriage rate for the population at large which is between 10% and 20%.

The researchers made it clear that the data is preliminary and that ""continued monitoring is needed to further assess"" possible effects in pregnancies associated with the vaccines.

""The findings may change as additional pregnancy outcomes are reported and the sample size increases which may facilitate detection of rare outcomes"" the study said.

Fact check:False claim that COVID-19 vaccine isn't effective because you're not charged for it

Martha Sharan a spokesperson for the CDC Vaccine Task Force said experts are currently analyzing the most recent data from over 1000 other participants who were vaccinated in their first trimester. A report is forthcoming.

Daily Expose article skewed data

The Daily Expose article linked on the image shared on Instagram claims women who were vaccinated within the first 20 weeks of their pregnancy had an 82% rate of miscarriage.

The publication altered the data used to calculate the miscarriage rate in order to get that percentage. Researchers divided 104 – the number of miscarriages recorded – by 827 – the total number of completed pregnancies at the time of analysis.

But the article argued because the 700 women who had live births were vaccinated in their third trimester when miscarriages are less common they shouldn't be used as part of the sample to analyze the miscarriage rate.

So the Daily Expose changed the denominator and divided 104 by 127 which it claims is the number of women who were pregnant and were vaccinated in their first or second trimester. That results in the claimed 82% miscarriage rate.

But that change doesn't portray the data accurately according to Sharan.

""This is not an appropriate calculation based on the data available because more than 1000 pregnancies (from those vaccinated in the first and second trimester) were ongoing and their outcome data wasn't available at the time of the report"" she said.

Fact check:Mayim Bialik actress and neuroscientist has been vaccinated contrary to claim

Other experts agree.

Victoria Male a reproductive immunology lecturer at Imperial College called the new percentage ""a meaningless statistic"" in a Twitter thread.

Male explained why the reasoning is flawed: Using that new denominator only takes into consideration completed pregnancies in the first and second trimester in which a miscarriage is the only result possible.

""Presumably the only reason that rate isn't 100% is because some people vaccinated at the end of the 2nd trimester completed their pregnancies within three months by giving birth"" she tweeted.

Our rating: False

We rate the claim that a study found vaccinated pregnant women had an 82% rate of miscarriage FALSE based on our research. The claim is based on a mischaracterization of the data available experts say. The process used to come up with the 82% figure ignores any women who were vaccinated in the first and second trimester and didn't miscarry data thathas not yet been released.

Apna number kab aayega?,"Nearly a month after India's drug regulator granted a restricted emergency use approval to Moderna's Covid-19 vaccine and officials issued positive statements about the Pfizer vaccine neither of them are yet being used in India. There is no clear answer as to when these vaccines will be included in the ongoing nationwide Covid-19 vaccination drive.

Meanwhile India's neighbours -Sri Lanka Bangladesh and Pakistan-have already received lakhs of doses of Moderna and Pfizer vaccines weeks ago and more are expected to be delivered soon.

On June 29 the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) granted a restricted emergency use approval to Moderna making it the fourth Covid-19 vaccine to get such approval in India after Covishield Covaxin and Sputnik V.

On July 2 the central government said it is expecting doses of Moderna vaccine to reach India in the next few days.

Eighteen days later Regional Director of the World Health Organisation (WHO) (South-East Asia) Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh said India has been offered 7.5 million (75 lakh) doses of Moderna vaccine through WHO's Covid-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) programme.

However there is no clarity on when Moderna jabs would be available in India. As per the WHO the vaccine's availability is ""subject to clearance of indemnity clause"" by the Indian government.

This donation of 7.5 million doses of Moderna vaccine from COVAX is separate from those that require a purchase agreement with the vaccine makers.

As far as purchasing American vaccines is concerned Moderna in May stated that it is overbooked with international orders and will not be available to supply commercially before 2022.

LEGAL INDEMNITY: KABHI HAAN KABHI NA

Foreign vaccine manufacturers like Moderna and Pfizer have been seeking legal protection from the Indian government against any adverse claims that are linked to the use of their Covid-19 vaccines. Rolling out of these vaccines is conditional upon the government providing the manufacturers this legal protection.

This indemnity clause to the vaccine rollout has been a major bone of contention between the Indian government and the vaccine makers and has delayed the vaccines from reaching India.

After initially hinting that India would be open to giving indemnity to foreign vaccine makers such as Moderna and Pfizer the government now seems to be apprehensive about such a commitment.

On June 2 the Indian government said it would likely grant indemnity to Moderna and Pfizer for their Covid-19 vaccines.

The issue of indemnity to foreign vaccine manufacturers is not a recent one. It has been under discussions for several months.

""We are discussing (indemnity clause) but at this moment we are focusing on the language of the contract for the indemnity clause. Discussion is happening clause by clause with the vaccine manufacturers"" a government source privy to the discussions had told India Today TV on July 13.

Sources in the Union Health Ministry have said Pfizer has already indicated that it would be able to make available some doses by July 2021. ""The government would look at rules and practices that have been followed in other countries on granting indemnity coverage"" one of the sources said.

Speaking on availability of foreign Covid-19 vaccines Niti Aayog member Dr VK Paul recently said the government is ""working actively"" with Moderna to see how its Covid-19 vaccine can be imported and be made available in India.

MODERNA PFIZER VAX REACH PAK BANGLADESH SRI LANKA

While rollout of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines is stuck over indemnity clause the vaccines have already reached India's neighbours like Pakistan Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.

All these countries have received millions of doses of the American vaccines over the past few weeks.

On July 3 Pakistan received 2.5 million (25 lakh) doses of Moderna vaccine from the US and more are expected to be delivered in the coming days. The doses will be administered to Pakistani citizens aged more than 18 years.

Bangladesh also received 2.5 million (25 lakh) doses of Moderna vaccine on July 3 via COVAX the WHO-backed initiative for equitable distribution of Covid-19 vaccines.

Meanwhile Sri Lanka was the first South Asian nation to receive Pfizer vaccine doses from the US.

ROADMAP TO MODERNA's ROLLOUT UNCLEAR

In early July the government said it was expecting Moderna vaccine to reach India before July 15. Since the vaccine is an mRNA vaccine and needs to be stored in colder temperatures of below -70 to -80 degrees Celsius it was being discussed to make it available in a few major government hospitals by the middle of this month.

The distribution would then take another week. The vaccine was to be provided free of cost to the beneficiaries as they are part of COVAX Alliance and a donation from the US government.

The Indian drug manufacturer Cipla was given permission to import Moderna's Covid-19 vaccine. However at present Cipla is allowed to import only those doses that Moderna has committed to donate to India. There is no clarity if and when commercial purchase of the vaccine will be facilitated between the two countries.

PARLIAMENT QUESTIONS DELAY

The issue of delay in Moderna and Pfizer vaccines reaching India was also raised in Parliament recently.

In a written reply in the Rajya Sabha on July 20 the government said ""Covid-19 vaccine manufactured by Moderna has been approved for restricted use in emergency situation by the Drug Controller General of India. Covid-19 vaccine manufactured by Pfizer is not yet approved by the national regulator.""

It added ""No doses of Moderna and Pfizer vaccines have so far been received under US donation programme. NEGVAC (National Empowered Group on Vaccine Administration against Covid-19) is deliberating with offshore Covid-19 vaccine manufacturers including Moderna and Pfizer for procurement of these vaccines.""

In another response the government said ""The exact number of doses to be imported and their manner of allocation has not been finalised yet.""

So you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.

Over the past month shares of this world's largest consumer products maker have returned +5.8% compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.2% change. During this period the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry which P&G falls in has gained 6.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?

While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.

Earnings Estimate Revisions

Rather than focusing on anything else we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.

Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price investors tend to buy the stock resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.

For the current quarter P&G is expected to post earnings of $1.37 per share indicating no change from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.4% over the last 30 days.

For the current fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.55 points to a change of +11% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days this estimate has changed +1.6%.

For the next fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.97 indicates a change of +6.3% from what P&G is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month the estimate has changed +0.3%.

Having a strong externally audited track record our proprietary stock rating tool the Zacks Rank offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate along with three other factors related to earnings estimates P&G is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Projected Revenue Growth

While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.

In the case of P&G the consensus sales estimate of $20.81 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +1.3%. The $84.32 billion and $87.18 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +2.8% and +3.4% respectively.

Last Reported Results and Surprise History

P&G reported revenues of $20.2 billion in the last reported quarter representing a year-over-year change of +0.6%. EPS of $1.52 for the same period compares with $1.37 a year ago.

Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.48 billion the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.41%. The EPS surprise was +7.04%.

The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.

Valuation

No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.

Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples such as its price-to-earnings (P/E) price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF) to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued overvalued or undervalued whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.

As part of the Zacks Style Scores system the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on) making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued rightly valued or temporarily undervalued.

P&G is graded D on this front indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.

Conclusion

The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about P&G. However its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

Getting a star athlete on a video call for a reasonable fee was an easy sell to fans but not to the athletes—the company had so many athlete no-shows for calls that the effort was scuttled by constant refunds.

He has higher hopes for his second athlete venture: Finlete which keeps the fan meet-and-greet of the first effort but adds what should be a stronger motivator—more money.

“Finlete is a platform that allows fans to support for now minor league baseball players” Connolly said in a phone call. “And with the current amount of money that these athletes make in the minor leagues there’s a really interesting potential return that people participating in Finlete can see.”

Finlete is a new entry in the increasingly popular financial play of athlete investing in which funds swap an upfront payment to an aspiring pro in exchange for a fixed percentage cut of future sports income. Comcast owns 7% of Finlete’s business while famed venture capitalist Tim Draper has a $50000 seed investment in the endeavor.

For Finlete Connolly sees a lot of potential in farm team ballplayers partly because minor league baseball pays most players badly. Finlete’s first athlete Texas Rangers middle infield prospect Echedry Vargas signed with the club out of the Dominican Republic in 2022 for a $10000 bonus–the minimum at the time according to Connolly. Right now Vargas plays in A-ball where salaries max out at $27300. “He’s like a minimum wage guy … but outperforming players that signed for millions of dollars” the executive said.

Finlete is taking a crowd-funding approach selling shares in a Securities & Exchange Commission-registered offering to retail investors. Investors can buy shares in Vargas for $8 (with a 12-share minimum) with the player receiving a $500000 advance. In exchange investors get a claim of 10% of his baseball earnings for the next 25 years if he makes The Show or even if he ends up off-Broadway so to speak in the top pro leagues of Japan Korea and Taiwan according to the player agreement disclosed as part of the offering. If he fails to make the majors stateside or in Asia Vargas won’t owe anything. The offering is still raising money and has about $26000 in commitments according to the Finlete website.

The presence of smart money suggests there’s increasing traction with the idea of swapping a lump sum of cash now for a cut of athlete income later on. The current wave of start-ups was sparked by the initial success of Big League Advance a private fund that is best known for striking a deal with the now-superstar Fernando Tatis Jr. when he was a minor leaguer. Finlete joins the golf pro-focused Commonwealth Sports NFL player-backing Vestible and international soccer player investing Nordensa—which isn’t available to American investors—as more recent entrants to the budding scene.

Conscious of the other competitors in the space the company sees the carryover of the original Cameo-like idea as a key to drawing in fan investors; part of the pitch to athletes too is to build a cadre of supporters early. In Vargas’ case he commits to things such as signing 100 autographs annually and holding meet-and-greets with fans at games as perks to people buying a minimum number of shares and at least two 30-minute video-chat appearance annually under the deal.

“It’s like a PG version of OnlyFans” Connolly said. “You’re involved with the athlete on an intimate level. You get to be a part of the athlete’s journey you get to hear what they’re struggling with and what they’re working on.”

Such a relationship is also potentially lucrative for Finlete. If the current share offering in Vargas’ future income sells its maximum proposed level of $800000 (100000 shares) $300000 goes to cover the offering costs and reimbursements to Finlete. It’s not quite a fair comparison because certain costs aren’t proportional but a typical stock IPO sees about 5% of proceeds directed to expenses and commissions. Finlete also gets the right of first refusal to buy any future baseball-related income Vargas might consider selling.

“We want to do $100 million in revenue in two years. We want to create a trading platform that allows fans to buy and sell their positions … and have over 100 athletes on our platform from Nascar drivers to horse racing jockeys to baseball players and UFC fighters” Connolly said.

That’s a lot of hope riding on the shoulders of Vargas who is currently batting .227 for the Down East Wood Ducks of the Carolina League.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDE5LmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA5L3BnLXNpdHRlbmZlbGQtY29ycnVwdGlvbi1jYXNlLWZlZGVyYWwtYXBwZWFscy1jb3VydC1oZWFyLWFyZ3VtZW50cy10aHVyc2RheS_SAXxodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3gxOS5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8wOS9wZy1zaXR0ZW5mZWxkLWNvcnJ1cHRpb24tY2FzZS1mZWRlcmFsLWFwcGVhbHMtY291cnQtaGVhci1hcmd1bWVudHMtdGh1cnNkYXkvP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,P.G. Sittenfeld corruption case: Federal appeals court hears arguments Thursday,"CINCINNATI (WXIX) - Attorneys for former Cincinnati City Council member P.G. Sittenfeld returned to a federal courtroom Thursday to try to overturn his convictions for bribery and attempted extortion.

A three-judge panel with the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments from his attorneys and then federal prosecutors.

No decision is expected anytime soon.

Sittenfeld 39 of East Walnut Hills is one of three former Cincinnati council members arrested in 2020 and convicted on federal public corruption charges in a series of cases federal authorities launched in 2017.

At the time of his arrest Sittenfeld was the front-runner in the mayor’s race and repeatedly received the most votes in city council elections.

Sittenfeld rejected a plea deal before his trial that would have limited his punishment if found guilty from probation only to two years or less in prison court records show.

The jury did find him not guilty on four of the six total charges. Those were two counts of honest services wire fraud and one count each of bribery and extortion.

Last year U.S. District Court Judge Douglas Cole rejected Sittenfeld’s request to throw out his convictions and get a new trial.

Sittenfeld failed to present “any persuasive arguments” supporting either motion the judge wrote in his 26-page order.

Judge Cole sentenced Sittenfeld to 16 months in prison and one year of supervised release once he’s out.

In early January Sittenfeld reported to a prison in northeastern Kentucky. Federal Correction Institution of Ashland is a minimum-security prison about 2.5 hours away from Cincinnati.

It was listed as one of America’s “10 Cushiest Prisons” by Forbes magazine.

Federal prosecutors say Sittenfeld promised to support perform “official acts” and “deliver the votes” to help the development of a property with sports betting at 435 Elm Street across from the Duke Energy Convention Center in downtown Cincinnati in exchange for $20000 in donations to his political action fund (PAC) federal court records show.

His indictment alleged he solicited the money in exchange for his support to develop the Elm Street property which former Cincinnati Bengals player turned developer Chinedum Ndukwe envisioned as a hotel and office complex with apartments and a restaurant.

“This was not a single event one-off deal or momentary lapse in judgment” federal prosecutors wrote in his sentencing memo.

“Sittenfeld’s actions were part of a broader strategy to use his position of power within local government and his prospects for higher office to extract financial contributions out of individuals who regularly conducted city business. In doing so Sittenfeld made clear that his support for their city business was tied directly to their contributions to him. This is not faithful public service or even “politics as usual”—this is corruption.”

Sittenfeld’s federal trial attorneys however have repeatedly said that his indictment actually proved he did not commit a “quid pro quo.”

He has always been pro-development they noted contending his actions (raising money for future campaigns) are all perfectly legal and this is typical business conducted by politicians.

Sittenfeld’s lead appellate attorneys are Yaakov Roth and James Burnham.

Burnham is a Washington D.C. attorney considered an expert in federal corruption law because he successfully represented former Virginia Governor Robert F. McDonnell in McDonnell v. United States.

That case was a major challenge to the scope of the Federal corruption laws because the 2016 ruling narrowed the legal definition of public corruption and made it harder for prosecutors to prove that a political official engaged in bribery.

In 2017 then-President Donald Trump appointed Burnham as Special Assistant to the President and Senior Associate Counsel to the President.

Now in Sittenfeld’s appeal Burnham and Roth argue that federal prosecutors didn’t show clear and precise proof of corruption the “quid pro quo.”

If Sittenfeld’s convictions are allowed to stand it would bring “a First Amendment Ice Age” where every politician could face prosecution for fundraising according to his appeal.

“The government engineered a sting to see if (Sittenfeld) would accept a campaign donation in exchange for supporting a local development project. To maximize the sting’s chances of success the FBI approached Sittenfeld through one of his longtime existing donors in connection with a project Sittenfeld had already agreed to support” his appeal states.

“Yet despite the choreography Sittenfeld never bit. Over the course of a year-long prosecutorial Truman Show Sittenfeld rejected the only express quid pro quo his friend offered cautioned him on the legal limits around donations turned away contributions that did not comport with obscure campaign-finance rules and even invited two undercover agents to a dinner party with the U.S. Attorney.”

Several amicus briefs also have been filed in support of Sittenfeld’s appeal

Among them are ones from former U.S. Attorney Generals William Barr and John Ashcroft and the top federal prosecutor for the same government office who prosecuted Sittenfeld Carter Stewart. He was the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio from 2009 to 2016.

Sittenfeld’s case they wrote “has two highly unusual features that render it an extreme outlier among campaign-finance bribery prosecutions. First Mr. Sittenfeld’s conduct did not involve the typical signs of wrongdoing that prosecutors expect to see when a public official is engaged in a corrupt enterprise…

“Second the case resulted from a two-year investigation that involved a sting operation specifically intended to uncover evidence of misconduct…The result was a conviction for conduct that was not criminal.”

This is a big recruiting win for the Runnin' Utes as they add a very promising young talent to the mix.

Little announced his commitment via Twitter:

As a 6-foot-4 185 pound guard Little shows the ability to do a bit of everything. He can be the primary ball handler he has a strong handle to go along with good feel for scoring opportunities for himself or others. He can score inside and out and can play off the ball as well. There are a lot of natural playmaking qualities that Little possesses and he's showcased good defensive ones as well. Despite the fact that he saw inconsistent playing time this past season he is still regarded as a four-star transfer prospect.

Utah brought Little in for an official visit this past weekend and were able to make a very good impression. Little is a native of Finland which gives the program valuable relationships in the form of Hanno Mottola Mikael Jantunen and even Lauri Markennan all of whom are connected through the Finland national team.

Little entered the portal after his first and only season with Baylor. The Bears had quite the logjam in the backcourt which led to him looking for a better opportunity elsewhere. Little still showcased his productive potential in games where he got extended playing time.

He is a former top 50 overall prospect and top 10 point guard in the 2023 recruiting class. He committed to Baylor over Indiana and Villanova while also having significant interest from other power programs in college basketball as well. Little earned a 94 four-star rating and No. 9 ranking in 247Sports' 2023 recruiting class.

Little did not play his ""senior year"" of high school at Sunrise Christian Academy but played for the Helsinki Basketball Academy (HBA) in Finland. HBA is a part of the Finland 1st Division basketball league and is essentially a high school program competing against professional players in Finland. Little averaged 21.6 points 9.0 rebounds and 5.8 assists in 20 games in this league during the 2021-22 season.

Philip Morris International CEO Jacek Olczak said the company will stop selling Marlboro cigarettes in the UK within a decade.

He also said cigarettes should be banned in the UK similar to gas-powered cars.

The chief executive of Philip Morris International the maker of Marlboro cigarettes abroad said that his company will stop selling cigarettes in the UK within a decade.

CEO Jacek Olczak told The Mail on Sunday that the move is part of the company's goal to become smoke-free and to help end the use of traditional cigarettes.

Olczak also called on the UK government to outlaw cigarettes within a decade comparing them to gas-powered cars which will be banned from being sold in the country starting in 2030 according to The Telegraph.

""We can see the world without cigarettes. And actually the sooner it happens the better it is for everyone"" he said. ""With the right regulation and information it can happen 10 years from now in some countries. And you can solve the problem once and forever.""

Philip Morris International is separate from Philip Morris USA which makes Marlboro cigarettes in the US and is a division of the American tobacco corporation Altria. It split from Philip Morris USA in 2008 and recently announced plans to transform into a smoke-free company as well as its intention to buy British pharmaceutical company Vectura Group which makes asthma inhalers.

Anti-smoking groups in the UK criticized the move accusing tobacco companies of trying to position themselves as anti-smoking while still selling cigarettes products according to The Guardian.

Smoking kills more than eight million people worldwide each year according to the World Health Organization.

Jacek Olczak said the company could “see the world without cigarettes … and actually the sooner it happens the better it is for everyone.” Cigarettes should be treated like petrol cars the sale of which is due to be banned from 2030 he said.

Government action would end the confusion felt by smokers some of whom still thought the “alternatives are worse than cigarettes” Olczak told the Sunday Telegraph. “Give them a choice of smoke-free alternatives … with the right regulation and information it can happen 10 years from now in some countries. You can solve the problem once and forever.”

Philip Morris International (PMI) recently said it wanted half its turnover to come from non-smoking products as it morphs into a “healthcare and wellness company” with executive pay tied to its new mission to “unsmoke the world” by phasing out cigarettes.

Nonetheless the company has come under fire from anti-smoking campaigners who accused it of hypocrisy after it launched a £1bn takeover bid for Vectura a British pharmacy company that makes asthma inhalers.

Campaigners argue tobacco companies are positioning themselves as part of the solution to a smoke-free world while continuing to aggressively sell and promote lethal cigarettes. Smoking including secondhand kills roughly 8 million people a year according to the World Health Organization.

Tobacco firms have been moving into cigarette alternatives such as vapes and e-cigarettes. PMI is pushing the IQOS a cigarette device that heats tobacco to deliver nicotine without the smoke and tar that cause diseases including cancer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZXRyb2l0bmV3cy5jb20vc3RvcnkvYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAyMS8wNy8yNS9waGlsaXAtbW9ycmlzLW1vdmVzLXJlaW52ZW50LWNpZ2FyZXR0ZS1zd2F5ZWQtY3JpdGljcy1iaWctdG9iYWNjby8xMTc2NjIxODYv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Philip Morris' moves to reinvent the cigarette haven't swayed critics,"Corinne Gretler

Bloomberg

When Moira Gilchrist was first approached by Philip Morris International Inc. she wondered what a tobacco company wanted from a scientist who had previously worked on clinical trials for anti-cancer drugs.

The world’s largest cigarette maker was looking at ways of delivering nicotine in a product that reduced the harmful chemicals in smoking and needed her expertise in navigating the highly regulated pharmaceutical industry. Gilchrist a cigarette smoker at the time made the leap in 2006 becoming one of the first people from the pharma sector to join Big Tobacco viewed by many as the enemy of health.

“I thought if they can get this right this could be a solution for me personally but also for everyone else on the planet who like me light up cigarettes despite knowing the risks” Gilchrist said.

Fifteen years later Philip Morris whose brands include Marlboro and Chesterfield generates a quarter of its $28 billion in sales from smoke-free products and aims to boost that share to more than half by 2025. IQOS the device Gilchrist helped develop created an entirely new business line for the tobacco industry prompting rivals like British American Tobacco Plc and Imperial Brands Plc to scramble to keep up.

The smoke-free revolution is also one of necessity: Cigarette sales in the developed world have been declining and government regulation is getting tougher. The U.S. is considering a total ban on menthol cigarettes while Brookline a suburb of Boston is going to prohibit tobacco sales to anyone born this century.

With smoking trends going only one way Geneva-based Philip Morris which split off from Altria Group Inc. in the U.S a decade ago is looking elsewhere for revenue even at delivery systems for medicines.

In one of its boldest and most controversial moves yet the company said this month that it would buy British asthma drugmaker Vectura Group Plc a deal that would add fresh expertise in devices inhalation regulation and clinical manufacturing. Coupled with its recent purchase of Fertin Pharma A/S a maker of nicotine chewing gum and lozenges used for pain medication Philip Morris is arming itself to accelerate the development of new nicotine-free products.

But efforts to reinvent the cigarette haven’t weakened skepticism among antismoking groups that Philip Morris is truly aiming for a smoke-free future.

They argue the company and its rivals are keeping consumers hooked on nicotine with new alternative products that range from IQOS’s heated tobacco vaping and discreet pouches that can be nudged between gums and lips - and see the recent acquisitions as unsettling. For some there’s quite simply something wrong with a tobacco company owning a firm that makes drugs to treat respiratory illnesses.

Cancer Research UK said of the Vectura news that if Philip Morris really wanted to help “they could stop aggressively promoting and selling their products altogether.”

Vectura could also be damaged by the stigma of tobacco undermining its credibility in health care. The takeover could see it shunned at industry associations and barred from publishing papers or presenting data. The European Respiratory Society’s constitution and bylaws for example reject any links - even perceived links - to the tobacco industry.

While there are ethical concerns about the takeover the bigger threat to the deal may be a rival bid from Carlyle Group Inc. The private equity group previously agreed to buy Vectura until it was trumped by Philip Morris and it’s now considering its options raising the prospect of a takeover battle.

For Philip Morris Chief Executive Officer Jacek Olczak ownership concerns aren’t justified. While three-quarters of its revenue comes from combustibles the majority of its investment is now in smoke-free and so-called beyond-nicotine products he says.

“My reaction to ‘who is the owner?’ and that being what dictates opinion about something is that’s a path to nowhere” Olczak said in an interview with Bloomberg News. “Our aspiration is to solve the problem of smoking and it’s not a dream without substance to it - the technology for that exists.”

The Vectura and Fertin acquisitions hand the company major entry points for beyond-nicotine offerings. That includes expertise in oral and respiratory drug deliveries to speed up expansion in the wellness sector with products such as botanicals that boost energy or aid sleep as well as devices with potential medical use.

Vectura is also exploring inhalation as a way to treat non-respiratory diseases such as pulmonary vascular illnesses cancer and even covid-19.

Philip Morris Chairman Andre Calantzopolous cites the example of a heart attack sufferer who can chew on an aspirin to slow and shrink the size of a forming blood clot. But in a dire situation it may not start working fast enough.

“If you inhale it the bioavailability is a couple of minutes and that can save a lot of lives” Calantzopolous said. He added that PMI’s goal is not to discover new treatments but find ways to accelerate therapeutic delivery of existing ones as inhalation is the second-fastest way for molecules to get into the bloodstream aside from injection.

Along with product development comes the campaigning and lobbying areas where Big Tobacco has a troubled history that keeps alive suspicion about the industry.

Earlier this year Ruth Malone a professor at the University of California San Francisco and editor in chief of the Tobacco Control journal wrote an op-ed in the British Medical Journal criticizing the tobacco industry’s embrace of harm reduction as a way to weaken tobacco control and take over the narrative about their products.

Gilchrist challenged the view several times on Twitter asking the BMJ to publish her response which pointed out that the vast majority of smokers don’t quit but still want better alternatives to cigarettes. The journal rejected her rebuttal as public relations and Gilchrist eventually published her response on open science forum Qeios instead.

Given how hard some smokers find it to quit some authorities like Public Health England are taking a more relaxed stance on new products saying they can be a tool to help people. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized IQOS to be marketed as a modified risk tobacco product meaning switching can reduce a person’s exposure to harmful chemicals.

Much of Philip Morris’s future lies in The Cube its research center on the shores of Lake Neuchatel in Switzerland. In one room dozens of machines test heated-tobacco sticks to ensure they last for the promised 14 drags during a six-minute window. In another a chamber full of IQOS puffs is measured for particles and toxicity. Some tests are done on what’s called “lung on a chip” reconstructed lung tissue used for laboratory testing.

Hundreds of experts have been hired from the medical pharmaceutical life sciences and electronics sectors as well as communications to develop these new products and present naysayers with statistics and scientific evidence.

The ease with which Philip Morris hires such new employees today contrasts to when Gilchrist first joined. Back then hiring from pharma was harder because the company kept a lid on its smoke-free plans and people were more hesitant about joining an industry linked with disease and premature death.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50L2JkYjVlOTMwLTY5YzUtNDBlZS1iNzkwLWUxNDY4ZGYzZjg3NtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Philip Morris to stop selling Marlboro cigarettes in UK within 10 years,"Try unlimited access Only MX$100 for 4 weeks

Those who want to continue smoking will be encouraged to switch to modern alternatives such as e-cigarettes or heated tobacco devices which are considered less harmful.

Tobacco giant Philip Morris International will stop selling cigarettes in Britain within the next ten years its boss has revealed

'I want to allow this company to leave smoking behind' Olczak said. 'I think in the UK ten years from now maximum you can completely solve the problem of smoking.'

Asked if that meant Philip Morris would stop selling traditional cigarettes in the UK within that time he replied: 'Absolutely.'

Olczak said the Marlboro brand will vanish from Britain. 'It will disappear. The first choice for consumers is they should quit smoking.

'But if they don't the second best choice is to let them switch to the better alternatives.'

The Government has laid out a blueprint for Britain to go 'smoke-free' by 2030 which includes a plan to reduce the prevalence of cigarette smoking among different age groups."

The broad-based index of energy agriculture industrial metals and precious metals rose the same amount as high-flying Bitcoin which pulled back after hitting its all-time high of more than $63000 on April 13.

Among the commodities we track West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil was the number one performer up nearly 52% on higher-than-expected demand and tight supply while precious metals lagged with silver down 1% and gold down more than 6%.

This represents a nearly complete reversal from the price action we saw in 2020. According to our Periodic Table of Commodity Returns precious metals were last year’s winners—silver surged close to 48% gold 25%—and oil was the big loser slipping as much as 20%.

But appetite for risk has changed now that huge segments of the economy are reopening. Demand for fuel has increased as Americans act on pent-up wanderlust: Earlier this month a greater number of people flew on commercial jets in the U.S. than on the same day in 2019 before the pandemic. And in the days leading up to the busy Fourth of July holiday weekend gas stations across the country were reportedly running out of gas.

After a Remarkable Turnaround Oil Demand Sets a New Record

The last six months were a profitable time to invest in the oilfield. The S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production Select Industry Index gained approximately 65%.

We participated with a number of companies including ConocoPhillips Valero Energy Phillips 66 and Halliburton among others. Earnings for the second quarter aren’t expected until next month but we believe investors will be pleased. In April Moody’s forecast that oil companies’ earnings may rise by a median rate of 50% compared to last year—though it’s worth noting that this is off a very low base.

Production companies should be well positioned going forward as long as they can maintain capital discipline and operating efficiency. Bloomberg reports that U.S. oil consumption hit a new record seasonally-adjusted high during the week ended July 2. “While gasoline and diesel demand have returned to pre-pandemic levels a surge in petroleum use for products such as plastic asphalt lubricants and other industrial needs is propelling the recovery” the article reads.

Gold Fundamentals Remain Solid

It’s no secret gold had a rough six months but a retrace of the bull market could be in the works due to strong fundamentals.

To me inflation is looking like a greater risk than Powell & Co. are admitting to publicly. Anyone who’s shopped for a new car in the past few months knows that prices are heading sharply up. The cost to eat out jumped 0.7% in June from the previous month the biggest such increase since January 1982. The producer price index (PPI) for final demand excluding volatile food and energy skyrocketed 5.6% compared to the same month last year representing the fastest pace since records began in 2011.

Investors seeking a haven may need to look elsewhere than government bonds. The 30-year Treasury yield currently trades below 2% even less when you factor in inflation meaning investors are effectively paying the U.S. government to hold its debt. As I said last month gold is the ultimate contrarian investment right now. The metal remains extremely undervalued compared to the S&P 500. The current climate definitely feels risk-on but I believe it’s only wise to hold around 10% in gold and gold mining stocks to help soften the impact of a worsening pandemic debt crisis or some other potential shock. I also recommend no more than a 1% to 2% allocation to Bitcoin and Ether as well as crypto mining stocks.

Here's What Will Happen Next,"PNC must go to work on integrating BBVA into the organization which includes achieving cost savings and hopefully finding revenue synergies.

The Pittsburgh-based regional bank PNC Financial Services Group (PNC -0.06%) made a splash last year when it sold its longtime stake in the world's largest asset manager BlackRock and said it would use the proceeds to look opportunistically for a large acquisition. In November PNC made good on that promise announcing that it would acquire the U.S. banking division of the Spanish lender BBVA which came with more than $100 billion in assets and a presence in attractive banking markets such as Florida Texas Arizona and California.

In June PNC formally closed on the $11.5 billion acquisition. Here's what to expect next.

Integrating BBVA into PNC

With regulatory approval secured and the acquisition formally closed PNC has cleared a major hurdle with the market. While most banking deals that are announced do go through shareholders will feel some relief to see that one of the larger acquisitions of recent years is moving forward.

With that said the real work is only just beginning. Now PNC must integrate BBVA into its operations. This involves the technical integration of bringing BBVA onto PNC's core operating systems and changing all of the branding and logos at all the branches. Then there is combining each bank's culture and getting everyone on the same page. Then there is the financial work which involves eliminating expenses that are no longer needed and taking advantage of revenue opportunities by cross-selling products and services from each bank to the other bank's customers.

You can actually track some of these stages through the bank's quarterly data. For instance we know that PNC expects to spend $980 million on merger and integration expenses which are one-time costs and non-recurring. These started to trickle into the company's expenses in the second quarter of the year.

As you can see in that little gray section at the top of the 2Q21 bar PNC had $181 million of its expenses related to significant items in the quarter of which $101 million went to integration costs. PNC's CFO Rob Reilly said to expect the majority of the $980 million in merger and integration expenses to come through this year so expenses may be elevated for the next few quarters. Also due to the low rate and challenging revenue environment mainly due to a lack of loan growth expect PNC's efficiency ratio (expenses expressed as a percentage of revenue so lower is better) to be elevated the rest of the year as well. PNC's 65% efficiency ratio in Q2 was the highest the bank has had over the last five quarters.

Further tracking acquisition progress

Following the integration and merger costs the bank also expects to eliminate $900 million of BBVA's annual non-interest expenses or roughly 35% in 2022. So while expenses and the efficiency ratio may be elevated this year they should start to abate in 2022 as the cost savings kick in. PNC has told us that earnings per share (EPS) in 2022 should be 21% higher with BBVA attached than what PNC was expected to generate on a stand-alone basis. And that's largely due to these cost savings so be sure to track merger and integrations costs cost savings and EPS to know the bank is staying on track.

Longer term you also want to look for the bank to grow revenue with BBVA. Revenue synergies are not modeled into the deal's financials but investors and the bank will definitely hope to see some once BBVA is fully integrated and the $900 million in annual costs are stripped out. The main opportunities are expanding PNC's national commercial and industrial lending model to BBVA markets as well as offering BBVA clients fee income products that BBVA couldn't previously offer.

PNC has a good track record of integrating and successfully enhancing shareholder value through acquisitions and the bank is off to a good start with all of its projected financials regarding the deal either on schedule or coming in better than expected as of June 30.

Keep watching

PNC is off to a good start following the closing of its acquisition of BBVA USA. But watch carefully to make sure that merger and integration costs don't exceed $980 million and that the bank achieves its full $900 million in cost savings and 21% EPS growth in 2022. These are all key to making the deal financially attractive to investors. Longer term investors will probably want to see some revenue growth start to materialize toward the end of 2022 and early in 2023. Most acquisitions look good when they are announced but can fall woefully short when everything is said and done which is why it's important for investors to pay close attention and hold the bank accountable.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vamFtYmFuZHMuY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMS8wNy8yNC9kYXZlLW1hdHRoZXdzLWJhbmQtcGxheS1maXJzdC1zaG93LW9mLXUtcy10b3VyLTIwMjEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dave Matthews Band Play First Show of U.S. Tour 2021,"Dave Matthews Band Play First Show of U.S. Tour 2021

Dave Matthews Band played their first show since the start of the pandemic at the Coastal Credit Union Music Park at Walnut Creek in Raleigh N.C. last night July 23. The show was broadcast live on SiriusXM Channel 30 (Dave Matthews Band Radio).

Dave Matthews Band opened with “41” a slow open track that builds upon itself to exhibit all the moving parts that make up the band. They then played break-out tracks “Granny” then “Grey Street” with its third verse for the first time since 2002. They also debuted their new song “Walk Around the Moon” for the first time live. “If we mess it up you won’t know it!” Matthews joked before beginning the song. Dave Matthews Band closed the set with “Stay (Wasting My Time).”

The band returned a five-song encore which began with a solo performance and live debut of “Singing From The Windows” from Matthews. They then “Pantala Naga Pampa” “Rapunzel” and “Kill the Preacher.” They closed the night completely with “Why I Am.”

Dave Matthews Band is partnered with the non-profit environmental organization REVERB which assists in calculating the carbon footprint in relation to fan travel to shows and helping bands neutralize these emissions by supporting carbon reduction projects.

Allegations of unfinished pools unpaid subcontractors and distributors and a long list of angry customers put Olympus in the spotlight and for all the wrong reasons.

In the past few months we have had numerous interactions with owner James Staten James Judge (a PR representative Staten hired to represent Olympus a few months ago) and Jordan Hidalgo a well known pool builder who had supposedly partnered with Olympus Pools to salvage the ongoing projects they had as well as the firms battered reputation.

In late May Olympus Pools had released a press release stating that Jordan Hidalgo a well respected figure in the pool and spa industry would be taking on co-ownership of Olympus Pools.

However this week after rumors began circulating about impending foreclosures on homeowners as well as another major blow due to unpaid workers compensation insurance causing a work shut down Hidalgo released this statement to the media.

“During our due diligence period it became apparent that the company was not in the same position as it appeared originally” Hidalgo said a statement on Tuesday. “As a result I have decided to cut my losses and am walking away from the opportunity. I am hoping the best for Olympus Pools and their customers.”

Olympus Pools currently has hundreds of ongoing pool construction projects in various stages of development. Potentially a hundred open holes in the ground with only rebar according to one source.

We reached out to Staten’s PR representative James Judge to get a comment to which he replied “We actually no longer represent Olympus Pools”. His leaving directly coincided with Hidalgo’s announcement.

James Staten responded to Hidalgo’s departure to investigative journalist Shannon Behnken in an email contradicting Hidalgo’s version of the story. Staten stated that Hidalgo was “never able to ‘buy’ even a portion of Olympus” and said that “there has been no ‘due diligence period’ and Mr. Hidalgo has failed to perform even his most basic obligations.”

We touched base with Hidalgo this week to get his side of the story to which he replied “That is an absolute lie. I tried to be classy about this entire thing but I can see he (Staten) is not going to let that happen. There is more information coming out in the media just wait.” To which Hidalgo eluded that this week there would be a major announcement coming.

Olympus Pools is Out of Business

This morning Olympus Pools officially announced that they will be shutting down operations after the Department of Business and Professional Regulation asked them to surrender their license. This effectively means that Olympus Pools will be unable to continue working on any current projects they have contracted for.

“Over the last several months at Olympus Pools we have endured constant negative media coverage encouraging viewers to file complaints with Florida’s Department of Business and Professional Regulation. As a result the DBPR has forced us to voluntarily relinquish our license. This means we are no longer allowed to continue working for any of our customers. We have fought hard and would have continued to do so for as long it took to complete every project.”

“Although we are greatly disappointed in the decision we understand the pressure that has been placed on the Department to act. We do not feel the decision is beneficial to our community or our customers however it was not our decision to make. If it were up to us we would continue working for our customers.”

“We have enjoyed servicing the Tampa Bay area for close to 10 years. We are proud of the thousands of projects we have built and the work we have done for our community in that time. We are grateful for all of the support the vast majority of our former customers employees friends family and neighbors have shown us during this time.”

Sources close to the organization disclosed to Pool Magazine that Olympus Pools currently has hundreds of ongoing pool construction projects and anywhere from 50-100 open holes in the ground.

It is expected that a variety of agencies will now descend to perform a collection of assets however the south showroom for Olympus Pools has been completely emptied out according to a source close to Pool Magazine. How this bodes for the unlucky homeowners who entrusted Olympus Pools with their swimming pool projects remains to be seen however already many have begun to receive lien and foreclosure notices on their homes.

You can see all of today’s research reports here >>>



Procter & Gamble’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry over the past year (+9.9% vs. +8.3%). The company has been gaining from robust pricing and a favorable mix along with strength across segments.



Procter & Gamble has been focused on productivity and cost-saving plans to boost margins. This led to bottom line beating the consensus mark for the seventh consecutive quarter in third-quarter fiscal 2024. Consequently PG has provided an optimistic fiscal 2024 view.



However the company has been witnessing supply-chain issues higher SG&A costs higher transportation costs and rising inflation. Its significant international presence exposes it to foreign currency risks which acts as a headwind.



(You can read the full research report on Procter & Gamble here >>>)



Shares Verizon of have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the past year (+12.8% vs. +11.7%). The company has reported modest first-quarter results with the bottom line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line missing the same. The deployment of a cloud-native container-based virtualized architecture has led to increased flexibility scalability and cost efficiency across its network.



Verizon is offering various mix and match pricing in both wireless and home broadband plans which has led to solid client additions. Focus on emerging growth services like cloud security and professional services will likely reap long-term benefits.



However lower wireline and wireless equipment revenues are major concerns. Huge promotional expenses and lucrative discounts to expand customer base are weighing on margins. High capital expenditure for continuous network upgrade and fiber deployment is a headwind. A muted guidance for 2024 is worrisome.



(You can read the full research report on Verizon here >>>)



Intuitive Surgical’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry over the past year (+25.7% vs. +4.0%). The company ended the first quarter on a positive note beating estimates on both counts. Revenues improved year over year. The strong performance is likely to continue in 2024 on the back of continued growth in the company’s da Vinci procedure volume coupled with strong Ion procedure growth.



ISRG’s initiative to increase the pricing of procedures should also continue to aid in sales growth in 2024.Improving procedure volume along with better system placements and services across all markets will drive top-line growth this year. Launch of da Vinci SP in Europe and da Vinci 5 in U.S. market should drive system placements higher.



However ongoing supply chain constraints although easing are likely to hurt the availability of devices. Labor shortage in hospitals will likely act as a headwind to procedure growth in 2024.

Mr. Biden’s decision this past week to name Jonathan Kanter to lead the Justice Department’s antitrust division is the latest sign of his willingness to clash with corporate America to promote more competition in the tech industry and across the economy. Mr. Kanter has spent years as a lawyer fighting behemoths like Facebook and Google on behalf of rival companies.

If confirmed by the Senate he will join Lina Khan who helped reframe the academic debate over antitrust and now leads the Federal Trade Commission and Tim Wu a longtime proponent of breaking up Facebook and other large companies who is now the special assistant to the president for technology and competition policy.

The appointments show both the Democratic Party’s renewed antitrust activism and the Biden administration’s growing concern that the concentration of power in technology as well as other industries like pharmaceuticals agriculture health care and finance has hurt consumers and workers and stunted economic growth.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5taWxpdGFyeS5jb20vZGFpbHktbmV3cy8yMDIxLzA3LzI1L3JpZmxlLWNvZmZlZS1kaXN0YW5jZXMtaXRzZWxmLWV4dHJlbWlzdHMtaW5jbHVkaW5nLXNvbWUtd2hvLWxvdmVkLXRoZWlyLWJyYW5kLmh0bWzSAYUBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWlsaXRhcnkuY29tL2RhaWx5LW5ld3MvMjAyMS8wNy8yNS9yaWZsZS1jb2ZmZWUtZGlzdGFuY2VzLWl0c2VsZi1leHRyZW1pc3RzLWluY2x1ZGluZy1zb21lLXdoby1sb3ZlZC10aGVpci1icmFuZC5odG1sP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Black Rifle Coffee Distances Itself from Extremists Including Some Who Loved Their Brand,"Evan Hafer just wants the vitriol to stop.

The founder and CEO of veteran-owned Black Rifle Coffee Company has received copious hate mail social media backlash and disparaging phone calls in the wake of a New York Times' article profiling the company which paints itself as an organization not only serving up a basic cup of joe but with an extra shot of patriotism delivered by military veterans.

Hafer and his colleagues hoped the article which ran July 14 would give them the opportunity to distance Black Rifle from right-wing fringe groups and individuals who've adopted its merchandise as their own. The piece would be the company's chance to denounce racism hatred bigotry and antisemitism from its brand once and for all arguing that the vitriol never aligned with the firm's mission.

That backfired.

Instead pundits and trolls alike immediately took Black Rifle's latest message to mean it was shutting out all conservative voices something Hafer says has been unreasonably conflated.

""You can taste the bigotry"" an unidentified man says exhaling with satisfaction after sipping from a supposed cup of Black Rifle Coffee in a fake commercial the company's IT department stumbled upon last week. In the mock advertisement which is seemingly intended to associate the brand more closely with the very people Hafer is publicly pushing away the man says that the coffee gets ""you in the right headspace before oppressing minorities.""

Now the seven-year-old organization which is ""pro-constitution pro-individuality"" is doing what it can to make sure its employees are taken care of since it expects the hostility to ramp up from angry fans and hecklers who aim to disparage or threaten Black Rifle and its patrons online and even at home.

""These aren't our customers"" Hafer said in an interview Wednesday. ""These are people that are making very illogical irrational statements about the company that are misleading"" he said referring to the relentless harassment and racist rhetoric he's seen cropping up on Twitter.

""I don't participate in the daily dialogue of what's happening you know in the fringe aspects of Twitter"" he added. ""I participate in real conversations with real people as I'm serving coffee at my coffee shop; those are the people I talk to people that I can put a face to a name.""

Hafer says he's not been one to engage in a culture war or political statements when promoting his coffee. Yet in a 2018 video Hafer and Mat Best the company's vice president team up to parody opposing political viewpoints. Dubbed ""Conservative Comes Out"" which has received 3.4 million views on YouTube Best and Hafer use extreme satire to depict a son ""coming out"" -- not as gay but as a supporter of the Second Amendment and other conservative causes. The depiction quickly turns into chaos when Hafer playing the role of Best's liberal father and the remaining members of the progressive family become hysterical slamming a cat to its death and pouring gasoline on one another in response to conservative viewpoints. One member even threatens to blow himself up with a suicide vest.

After years of hyping up a certain gun-toting unruffled machismo leaning heavily on the founders' military experience and veteran status to build its fan base -- a version of the ""tactical lifestyle"" that's hugely popular with paramilitary and ultranationalist groups -- did Black Rifle ultimately mislead the type of clientele they serve?

Hafer said he doesn't see it that way because at its core Black Rifle is about brewing good coffee and supporting veterans and first responders.

""We always do that with an eye toward inspiring educating and entertaining and we always take care of our community"" a company spokesperson said. ""It's what we've always done and will continue to do.""

""We're a group of guys that we've been working overseas the majority of our adult lives; we're veterans from the special operations community"" added Hafer a former Green Beret and contractor for the CIA who served in Afghanistan and Iraq.

""We just looked at what we were doing as 'This is the type of content that we want to see. It's funny it's irreverent'"" he said.

Hafer and his team don't connect to a single stereotype either. Hafer sees himself as the pro-vet pro-law enforcement pro-Second Amendment rights guy who also wears argyle socks and Birkenstocks and drives a Volvo.

""[Our message is] not meant to be like 'No you can't drink a vanilla latte if you're a Republican!' That's absurd"" Hafer said. ""If you think you have to conform to these humorous exaggerated stereotypes because that's how you think people actually live? Like wow how isolated and alone and miserable that person must be.""

He added ""We're not engaged in the war of words. We're more concerned with how funny our videos are -- whether or not they're making a political point.""

Not Just a Brouhaha over Brew

Despite the executive's assertions that Black Rifle is apolitical the company has waded into the political fray often at a time when politics and identity have become increasingly merged.

In 2017 for instance Black Rifle touted a ""Make Covfefe Great Again"" T-shirt which was a combination of then-President Donald Trump's popular ""Make America Great Again"" slogan and his viral ""covfefe"" tweet which looks a little like ""coffee"" -- a presumed typo made by the president that quickly became a meme.

Though the shirt has been removed from the company's website the spokesperson said it wasn't an endorsement of a political view just a play on the meme meant to be humorous.

It wasn't just merchandise. Soon enough Fox's Sean Hannity and Donald Trump Jr. were singing Black Rifle's praises giving the company more momentum with the MAGA crowd.

But then came a time when the company had to deliberately state what kind of followers wouldn't be tolerated: extremists.

In November 2020 Black Rifle publicly disavowed any support or sponsorship of Kyle Rittenhouse a 17-year-old Illinois resident who traveled to Kenosha Wisconsin where he shot and killed two people during a Black Lives Matter protest. In his post-jail photo Rittenhouse donned a shirt with Black Rifle's logo. ""We're not in the business of profiting from tragedy"" Hafer said in a video statement at the time.

Another instance was the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol attack. Black Rifle's branding made a splash when Eric Munchel first known as one of the ""zip-tie guys"" sported a company hat.

""Oh [expletive] here we go again"" Hafer told The New York Times describing his thinking upon seeing the photos of Munchel before he was formally identified.

In the Rittenhouse case Hafer drew a line in the sand to distance Black Rifle from extremist views. The company kept quiet in regard to Munchel but still got a heaping of backlash from the incident. Hafer made his position known again in the Times article specifically calling out racists and the Proud Boys a neo-fascist group of males who often show up to rallies gatherings or protests to oppose liberal or progressive groups.

""The misinformation that's being put out is that I have somehow connected those two groups with conservatives"" he told Military.com. Hafer who is Jewish has received antisemitic remarks too which he's openly condemned.

""I don't believe conservatives are either racist or anti-Semites I was merely stating these groups don't have a place in my company"" Hafer said. ""I don't know how you can actually interpret that from the story even as you're reading it but it's not [for] me to kind of weigh in on people's literacy levels.""

The company spokesperson said it's the third time that hate mail; doxxing or publishing private and identifying information on specific people; and trolling have come to rear their ugly heads. The spokesperson asked not to be identified because of the threats that company employees are facing.

In some cases staff members' official photos have been pulled into Reddit chat threads or on Twitter where trolls mock and make discriminatory remarks about their appearance or race. Other times employees receive the same cruel email hundreds of times in their inbox.

""A lot of focus right now is support for our internal team members who've been sifting through this stuff"" the spokesperson said. ""[That they] are taken care of have any resources they may need.""

The organization has yet to see evidence of coordinated online attacks -- but in an era of disinformation and misinformation Black Rifle isn't naive to groups concocting some type of scheme.

""Anything associated with any of these extremist groups that's just not who we are"" the spokesperson said.

Bauman Strikes Late to Win Port Royal Half-Mile

Whale takes points lead with third victory; Gauthier scores first win of 2021.

PORT ROYAL Penn. (July 24 2021) – Reigning Mission SuperTwins presented by S&S Cycle Champion Briar Bauman (No. 1 Indian Motorcycle/Progressive Insurance FTR750) denied Brandon Price (No. 92 Mission Roof Systems Indian FTR750) a first-career Progressive American Flat Track victory in a spectacular inaugural Port Royal Half-Mile presented by Appalachian Harley-Davidson at Port Royal Speedway in Port Royal Pennsylvania.

One day after dominating the pre-race test Price looked more than capable of doing the same in Saturday’s Main. The Mission Roof Systems pilot worked his way up from outside the top five and into the lead with apparent ease grabbing the lead just a minute-and-a-half into the contest.

It took the remaining eight-and-a-half minutes for Bauman to reel him back in frequently employing a very wide line that provided the requisite momentum when it came time for the decisive strike.

That ‘strike’ was actually ‘strikes’ as Bauman threw in a pair of hard passes over the race’s final two laps to put Price behind him and keep him there to the checkered flag.

After securing the 19th win of his career Californian-turned-Pennsylvanian Bauman said “I knew I needed to do it late. (Price) had been known today to not be afraid to kinda come up the inside and meet you at the exit. I knew if I was going to do it I had to run scared and get out quick. I got him once and then he was able to get back by me in 3 and 4. So I did it again.

“I love this stuff. I love this state and I love these types of tracks. It was kind of a bummer that I struggled for so long (throughout the day) but I don’t really get that fired up until the Main Event. I was happy to get fired up when it counted and make that one count.”

For Price the runner-up represented yet another near-miss. On the upside he also demonstrated both the speed and skill to push the world’s top dirt tracker to the brink.

“It’s a boost of confidence but I’m gutted at the same time” Price said. “I led pretty much the whole entire race. I felt him the last few laps but he made a good move going into Turn 1. I tried to get him back but the track is very technical out there and I just couldn’t get a drive off of Turn 4 to challenge him for the win.”

Jarod Vanderkooi (No. 20 Mission Roof Systems Indian FTR750) translated his first-ever Mission Challenge win into the early lead. However he ultimately found himself overhauled by Price Bauman and finally Jared Mees (No. 9 Indian Motorcycle/Progressive Insurance FTR750) who snatched away the final spot on the podium.

Fifth went to Davis Fisher (No. 67 BMC Racing/Dick Wall 60 Indian FTR750) by a scant 0.008-seconds over Bronson Bauman (No. 37 Indian Motorcycle of Oklahoma City FTR750) who came out of his Semi looking like a Main Event favorite.

Brandon Robinson (No. 44 Mission Roof Systems Indian FTR750) finished an uncharacteristic seventh. That off result allowed Bauman to rip open a rather significant championship lead as Bauman now heads the order by a full 25 points (164-139) over Robinson with Mees in third at 133.

AFT Singles

Max Whale (No. 18 Red Bull KTM Factory Racing 450 SX-FFE) took sole command of the AFT Singles championship by adding a third victory to his ‘21 title campaign.

The win didn’t come easily. To earn it the Australian was forced to go back and forth with a hard-charging Kody Kopp (No. 143 Smartop/Jones Honda/Latus Motors CRF450R) whose performance went a long way to fully justifying the rookie’s abundant preseason hype.

Kopp led several laps and squared up Whale on a number of occasions as part of an adrenaline-fueled ride to a maiden Progressive AFT podium. While his sights were set on the win Kopp was nearly displaced to third with high-line maestro Morgen Mischler (No. 13 Mission Roof Systems KTM 450 SX-F) ending a race-long charge 0.022-seconds short of the runner-up spot.

Trevor Brunner (No. 21 American Honda/Progressive Insurance CRF450R) and Trent Lowe (No. 48 WBR/Suzuki Motor of America RM-Z450) finished fourth and fifth respectively. The two followed in Mischler’s wake reeling in the leaders to put themselves in podium contention on a thrilling final lap that saw the top five finish within a second-and-a-half at the checkered flag.

Race winner Whale said “This track is really hard when you’re leading; I didn’t know what anybody was doing behind me. I had a good start but then I saw a red front fender come around the outside in (Turns) 1 and 2 and thought ‘Oh — I’m going to have to see what that is next lap.’

“Kody rode a great race with very minimal mistakes but I found a few lines in 3 and 4 and had a better run off 4 and ended up getting him. But he rode awesome.”

Whale’s big night was made that much bigger as a result of the relative struggles of defending class champion Dallas Daniels (No. 1 Estenson Racing Yamaha YZ450F) who finished ninth and rival Henry Wiles (No. 17 American Honda/Progressive Insurance CRF450R) who finished 15th.

Whale now leads Daniels by 15 points (151-136). When asked how that expanded margin impacts his strategy moving forward he said “Nothing changes. I’m just going to try to keep winning races. The bike is good and I’m enjoying it so I might as well keep trying.”

AFT Production Twins presented by Vance & Hines

2019 AFT Singles champion Dalton Gauthier (No. 79 D&D Cycles/Vance & Hines Harley-Davidson XG750R) earned his first AFT Production Twins presented by Vance & Hines victory of the season tonight with a large contingent of home-state fans cheering him on.

Gauthier shook free from 2018 AFT Singles king and fellow Pennsylvanian Dan Bromley (No. 62 Memphis Shades/Vinson Construction Yamaha MT-07) relatively early. He then went about building up his advantage en route to a blowout victory.

“It felt awesome winning in front of all the PA fans” Gauthier said. “That was a fun race track and I hope we come back next year. That helped my confidence so much. I’ve just been struggling so much this year. I’ve been trying my hardest but I feel like I shouldn’t be trying so hard. Tonight I just cruised out there. I can’t thank the Vance & Hines guys enough for giving me an awesome motorcycle.”

Title leader and holeshot expert Cory Texter (No. 65 G&G Racing/Yamaha Racing Yamaha MT-07) made Gauthier’s breakthrough a bit easier by stumbling off the start from pole. By the race’s midpoint Texter clawed his way into a three-way battle with Bromley and 2020 AFT Singles champ Dallas Daniels (No. 32 Estenson Racing Yamaha MT-07).

Despite taking part in his first-ever oval race aboard a twin-cylinder (he earlier won his class debut at the Atlanta Super TT) Daniels overcame the twin challenge presented by Texter and Bromley to lock down an most impressive runner-up finish.

As for Texter the fact that a seventh podium in eight races felt like a bit of a disappointment is a testament to the type of season he’s putting together. Despite Gauthier’s Saturday night triumph Texter walked away with a still-imposing 31-point lead in his favor.

Johnny Lewis (No. 10 Moto Anatomy X Powered by Royal Enfield Twins FT) fought his way forward throughout the Main ultimately putting the Royal Enfield ahead of Bromley’s Yamaha for fourth by 0.007 seconds.

The Port Royal Half-Mile presented by Appalachian Harley-Davidson will air on NBCSN on Sunday August 15 at 10:00 p.m. ET/7:00 p.m. PT featuring exclusive features and cutting-edge aerial drone and onboard footage.

Modern democracy arose because America’s radical founders renounced the divine right of kings and took up arms against England and George III. They created government of the people with no aristocracy.

Slavery ended because radical abolitionists hammered the entrenched institution until the horrible Civil War wiped it out.

Following the new knowledge given to humankind by Gandhi many more gains in human rights started to be made with nonviolent struggle instead of war.

Women gained the right to vote because radical suffragettes fought for decades against their inferior status.

Couples gained the right to birth control because radical feminists – especially Margaret Sanger – battled against prudes and the church.

Workers gained the right to organize unions because President Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal defeated corporate opposition and legalized it. And retirees gained Social Security pensions because the progressive New Deal created the safety net program.

Jobless people gained unemployment compensation – and those injured on the job gained worker’s compensation − because the New Deal created them too. Additionally it set the 40-hour work week banned child labor and set a minimum wage.

The poor gained welfare protection from the liberal New Deal also.

Censorship of sexy books magazines and movies was wiped out by progressive court cases. So were bluenose laws forcing stores to close on the Sabbath.

The historic civil rights movement and the progressive Supreme Court under Chief Justice Earl Warren struck down America’s cruel Jim Crow segregation. The Warren court also ended government-led prayer in schools. It wiped out state laws against birth control. Later liberal justices gave women and girls a right to choose to end pregnancies.

Taboos against lotteries liquor clubs and other “sins” fell away.

Strides toward universal health care as a human right for everyone included Medicare Medicaid Children’s Health Insurance Veterans’ care government employees coverage and finally Obamacare.

Conservatives tried to prevent teaching of evolution in public schools but they failed.

Conservatives tried to teach “creation” in public schools but they failed.

Conservatives tried to block sex education in public schools but they failed.

Puritanical right-wingers made racial intermarriage a crime but the liberal Warren court legalized it.

Puritanical right-wingers jailed gay lovers but progressives on the high court forced the government to get its nose out of the bedroom.

Fundamentalists fought same-sex marriage but Democratic state legislatures and ultimately the Supreme Court legalized it.

Humanism means helping people and secular means doing it without supernatural religion. Decade after decade century after century leftist reformers defeated conservatives to advance secular humanism. At the same time churches and their magical beliefs faded enormously from western democracies.

More recently international warfare has virtually disappeared.

Pioneer Unitarian minister Theodore Parker said the arc of history bends toward justice – and Martin Luther King Jr. who spent years as a young man attending a Unitarian church adopted the phrase masterfully.

The past shows a clear pattern of human progress – of civilization bending toward justice. Let’s hope it continues.

By contrast some entities related to the Holy See such as the IOR contributed more income to the Roman Curia in 2020. Overall expenses were reduced by $3.88 million.

Guerrero told Vatican News the Holy See comes “from a culture of secrecy but in economics we have learned that transparency protects us more than secrecy.”

He claimed the culture is changing and the institution is beginning to see itself as a caretaker not owner recognizing the accountability that calls for.

Releasing the 2020 balance “marks a turning point that can lead to greater credibility of the Holy See in economic matters” he said.

“First of all this process tells us about a past a recent past but a past” he underlined. “There can always be mistakes but today I do not see how the events of the past can repeat themselves.”

Galantino said that the activities APSA is carrying out go beyond “the serious consequences of the pandemic crisis.”

According to the bishop 14% of the properties managed by APSA are rented at market value while the remaining 86% those with institutional uses such as work places for Vatican employees and residences for retired cardinals charge no rent or are rented below market value.

APSA carried out a quantitative and qualitative update to the inventory of the buildings and land it administrates he said and found that many of the assets both those rented to tenants and those used for institutional purposes were in need of maintenance modernization and increased security.

He explained that APSA will also begin a renovation project on 100 apartments in January 2022 with a scheduled end date of sometime in spring 2023.

“Our energies are directed to a credible and reliable administration as well as effective and efficient allowing us to be guided by processes of rationalization transparency and professionalism also required by Pope Francis” he said.

According to Italian news agency ANSA the Secretariat for the Economy will begin implementing a new “pilot” review process of personnel in some offices.

ANSA reported that Guerrero had sent a letter to the heads of dicasteries saying the assessment of job performance is taking place in light of curial reform and “the need to make the most of deserving resources to provide new opportunities and to promote technical and professional training.”

With the release of the 2020 balance Guerrero told Vatican News that the economic secretariat wants “to ensure economic sustainability while also maintaining the pope’s correct decision not to fire anyone.”

He added that “to generate greater motivation in the staff it would be useful to make a plan with a long-term vision and to have a work policy with professional development programs and formation and particular attention to formation in the mission that is carried out in the Holy See. This would also save money in the long run.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjdHYxOC5jb20vZmluYW5jZS9pY2ljaS1iYW5rcy1iYWtoc2hpLWZvcmdvZXMtc2FsYXJ5LWluLWNvdmlkLXllYXItaGRmYy1iYW5rcy1wdXJpLXRvcC1lYXJuZXItYW1vbmctYmFua2Vycy1pbi1meTIxLTEwMTA1NDAxLmh0bdIBkwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjdHYxOC5jb20vZmluYW5jZS9pY2ljaS1iYW5rcy1iYWtoc2hpLWZvcmdvZXMtc2FsYXJ5LWluLWNvdmlkLXllYXItaGRmYy1iYW5rcy1wdXJpLXRvcC1lYXJuZXItYW1vbmctYmFua2Vycy1pbi1meTIxLTEwMTA1NDAxLmh0bS9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ICICI Bank's Bakhshi forgoes salary in COVID year HDFC Bank's Puri top earner among bankers in FY21,"HDFC Bank's Aditya Puri emerged as the highest grossing banker among the top three private sector lenders in his retirement year with total emoluments of Rs 13.82 crore.

Ninja Van aside from being backed by Facebook founder Eduardo Severin has seen growth in revenue and orders because of the eCommerce boom in its region. The Southeast Asia area has 400 million internet users. Chang Wen Lai who is a cofounder of the company said the company is “a year away” from an IPO while two people familiar with the company have said Ninja Van had begun approaching advisers about how to go about the process.

The U.S. they said would likely be the venue for the process.

Ninja Van has now been around for seven years and has 34000 employees and 1800 sorting stations.

The FT report says that the company is especially adept at delivering things to the thousands of more remote areas and villages in the region.

This according to the report has born fruit — the company has seen its daily shipments grow from 1 million in May 2020 to 1.7 million by July of this year even in spite of the COVID-19 pandemic and its ensuing lockdowns and complications.

In Southeast Asia sales have ballooned for eCommerce going up 63 percent in 2020 and now worth around $62 billion according to analyses from Google Singapore state-backed investor Temasek and consultancy Bain the report says. Companies in that region including ones like Gojek and Grab are getting more into logistics.

Ninja Van had a good 2020 raising $279 million PYMNTS reported in May 2020.

Ninja Van’s success came as the pandemic forced most people inside and made eCommerce the safest way to do business; companies in that field increasingly becoming darlings among investors.

Donald J. Trump the nation's 45th president is unique among U.S. presidents in his connections to the business world. Certainly there have been presidents before him who were businessmen: both George H.W. Bush and his son George W. were in the oil business. Herbert Hoover was in mining and Warren G. Harding was in the newspaper business.

The difference is that every president before Trump had held one or more government positions before taking the office or had served as a general in the military.

This means that Trump's business record and the performance of his companies were the public's only basis for measuring his professional performance before he became president.

We know considerably more now although there is still much to know. Here's what we know and don't know about Trump's business dealings his successes and failures and his financial health as he left the presidency.

Key Takeaways Trump's businesses generated at least $446.3 million in sales in 2019. That dropped about 40% to $278 million in 2020.

The Trump National Doral golf resort generated the most revenue of any of the former president's businesses in 2019 posting $77.2 million in sales. Its revenue plunged more than 40% in 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic year.

Trump's net worth slipped to about $2.3 billion during his presidency compared to about $3 billion before he took office according to Bloomberg. Separately Forbes estimates his current wealth at $2.1 billion.

Separately Forbes estimates his current wealth at $2.1 billion. Trump's personal income is unknown because he lists business revenue instead of profit on his financial disclosures.

Mixing Business and Politics

Trump's potential conflicts of interest were a prominent topic throughout his tenure from 2017 through 2020. As president the enormous power he had at his command made it more important than ever to understand his long list of businesses and how they could intersect with his public role as president.

These conflicts of interest did not pose a legal problem for Trump. The president and vice president are explicitly exempt from ethics regulations concerning conflicts of interest.

There were other issues though such as the emoluments clause which was written into the U.S. Constitution by the nation's founders. The clause prohibits the president from accepting things of value from foreign governments.

Many critics say the emoluments clause applies to Trump in several respects. But none of the many legal cases alleging violations by the former president have been concluded nor does it look like they will be in the near future.

The President's Trust

Most U.S. presidents for the past 40 years chose to put their investments into a blind trust to avoid real or perceived conflicts between the president's financial interests and the nation's best interests.

The owner of a blind trust has no knowledge or control over what assets are in the trust. Their use is a guard against accusations that the powers of the presidency are being used to benefit the office holder's financial interests.

One exception was President Barack Obama who did not use a blind trust because his only investments were in such vehicles as index funds and Treasury notes which were unlikely to pose conflicts of interest.

To create a blind trust it is first necessary to liquidate all of the trust owner's current assets so that new ones can be placed into the trust. Trump's assets were largely in highly illiquid real estate. They would have been costly and time-consuming or even impossible to liquidate. For example Trump can't sell his minority stakes in some office towers without the consent of the real-estate investment trust Vornado Realty Trust (VNO).

So Trump ignored this presidential norm instead of placing his assets in a trust that was managed by his two eldest sons. He was able to withdraw funds from the trust at any time for any reason without disclosing it.

In fact Eric Trump one of the trustees told Forbes in early 2017 that he planned to regularly update his father on the Trump family businesses.

This practice violates trust documents stating that trustees ""shall not provide any report to Donald J. Trump on the holdings and sources of income of the Trust.""

The result was that the president's businesses were held by a trust controlled by his sons and the ability of the trust to insulate the former president from conflicts of interest was questionable.

What We Know

The former president's business activities are largely opaque for several reasons. Trump's main company formally called the Trump Organization is a privately held business and is therefore not required to publish quarterly earnings releases like publicly traded companies do.

The former president has also notably refused to release his tax returns contrary to the recent practice of presidents.

Trump's annual financial disclosures to the U.S. Office of Government Ethics had become the primary avenue to assess what businesses the former president owned and how much they were making.

Every year the president is required to file a list of assets income sources positions held outside the U.S. government business transactions liabilities and gifts received. But in some instances critics say the former president had been reluctant to fully comply with these disclosure requests by delaying filing and going to unusual lengths to avoid providing clear answers to the public.

On Sept. 27 2020 The New York Times released two stories containing data from some 20 years of Trump's tax returns. The full records have not been released.

What We Don't Know

There are some caveats to keep in mind when assessing the data in the Trump Organization's financial disclosure forms.

First the data is unaudited self-reported data meaning that readers have to take the company's word that it's accurate.

Second many of the numbers listed as ""income"" from certain assets seem instead to be the revenue from those businesses. This was confirmed when data from Trump's tax returns were released by The New York Times showing that many of the businesses have been losing money including some of the largest revenue producers such as Trump National Doral golf resort.

That being the case the financial numbers don't show the amount of money that the former president actually took home as income. For example in Trump's 2017 disclosure he listed his income for the Trump National Doral golf resort as $75 million which matches the revenue number reported to Miami-Dade County. Net operating income for the resort for that year was dramatically smaller at $4.3 million.

Getting a clear picture of the former president's businesses is further complicated by the fact that income and asset values are listed in very wide ranges. For example Mar-a-Lago Club is listed as having a value of ""over $50000000."" The Trump National Golf Club in Charlotte is listed as worth between $5 million and $25 million.

Contradictions

Yet another complication is that the Trump Organization itself has contradicted its own numbers in disclosures. The Trump Organization contested Palm Beach County's $19.7 million valuation for the Trump International Golf Club in Jupiter Florida as being too high.

But the former president's government disclosure to the Office of Government Ethics valued the property at more than $50 million. This inflated the value of the former president's property to the public even as he was trying to deflate its value for tax purposes.

This lack of information means that any attempt to put a number on the former president's net worth is at best an educated guess and would require more information than has been disclosed.

Equally important: Because we do not know the expenses of the businesses listed it is impossible to figure out Trump's personal income from his own disclosures.

The Investigations

Public prosecutors are trying to answer these and similar questions. Trump and his company are being investigated by the New York State attorney general over how the Trump Organization values assets on financial statements used to obtain loans.

The Manhattan district attorney appears to be investigating similar claims of inflated asset values. The former president's former lawyer Michael Cohen has testified that Trump regularly inflated the value of company assets to get better loan terms.

On Feb. 22 2021 the U.S. Supreme Court allowed a subpoena by Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. for Donald Trump's tax returns as well as other financial records. Due to grand jury secrecy rules they were not made public.

All of these developments cast doubt on the value of unaudited self-reported financial data from the Trump Organization.

Trump's Current Wealth

Despite these obstacles valuable information can be gleaned from Trump's financial disclosures especially in concert with other information.

Forbes has used financial disclosures and a plethora of other sources to come up with an estimate of Trump's net worth after he left office. The publication currently pegs it at around $2.4 billion. This should be regarded as a rough estimate even though the publication did as thorough a job as possible given the dearth of information.

This $2.4 billion represents a significant drop having fallen from $3.1 billion since the end of 2019. This is largely due to the damage COVID-19 has done to the hotel and casino industries.

The second important financial number we can glean from these documents is that Trump and his businesses generated a minimum of $446.3 million in revenue in 2019 which is up 2.6% from $434.8 million the previous year.

Also available are specific revenue numbers for some of Trump's business interests. The numbers provide a general idea of which Trump businesses are the largest revenue generators and whether revenue is rising or declining.

The Real Sources of Wealth

The former president's businesses generally fall into five categories: hotels golf courses (or some combination of the two) condos residential and commercial real-estate rentals and payments for the licensing of Trump's name.

The New York Times articles unleashed a major new source of information besides confirming that Donald Trump's disclosed income numbers were actually revenue figures.

The numbers also show that companies owned by Trump were incredibly unprofitable for the period between 2000 and 2018. His real sources of income were a television show and some licensing deals.

Although certain enterprises such as Trump Tower have been profitable Trump businesses overall lost $174.5 million from 2000–2018. During the same period of time his net income from licensing and endorsement deals was $230 million his net income from The Apprentice television show was $197.3 million and his income from other investments in companies run by other people was $178.7 million.

Top 5 Businesses Owned by Donald Trump

The list below is limited to businesses for which a specific revenue amount was given. The numbers are the latest available from documents.

1. Trump National Doral

2019 Revenue: $77207936

2018 Revenue: $75962848

2019 Asset Value: Over $50000000

Business Type: Golf Resort

What is now the Trump National Doral golf resort was founded in 1962 in Doral near Miami. Trump bought the resort out of bankruptcy for $150 million in 2012.

The Doral was the source of considerable controversy in 2019 when the former president announced plans to hold the 2020 meeting of the G7 at Trump National Doral. He withdrew the proposal after accusations that this was an attempt to profit from his presidency.

2. Trump Old Post Office LLC

2019 Revenue: $40523041

2018 Revenue: $40842294

2019 Asset Value: Over $50000000

Business Type: Hotel

This business is a holding company for the Trump International Hotel in Washington D.C. which operates in the Old Post Office building a national landmark. Trump's company holds a long-term lease on the property owned by the U.S. government which could last nearly 100 years with extensions.

The hotel was at the center of a major emoluments case against the former president. A group of hotel and restaurant owners sued Trump for violating the emoluments clause alleging that he was unconstitutionally profiting from his office because his hotel gets the business of foreign officials staying there to curry his favor. The group argued that this gave the former president's hotel an unfair competitive advantage against their businesses.

Possibly as a result of lawsuits and public criticism the Trump Organization planned to sell its lease to the property. They were seeking a purchase price of more than $500 million one of the highest-priced hotel deals per room ever. The sale process was placed on hold due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

3. Trump Ruffin Tower LLC

2019 Revenue: $27677448 divided between $4414500 in condo sales and $23262948 in hotel revenue

2018 Revenue: $28558298 divided between $6002244 in condo sales and $22556054 in hotel revenue

2019 Asset Value: Over $50000000

Business Type: Hotel and Condominium Complex

Trump Ruffin Tower LLC manages the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Las Vegas. Constructed in 2008 the tower is a combination hotel and condominium development.

It struggled as the Great Recession hit when it opened more than a decade ago devastating the real estate market. Plans for a second tower were scrapped.

4. Trump Turnberry

2019 Revenue: 25691318

2018 Revenue: $23446634

2019 Asset Value: Over $50000000

Business Type: Golf Resort

Originally built in 1906 by Archibald Kennedy the third Marquess of Ailsa Trump Turnberry is one of two golf resorts the former president owns in Scotland.

Trump purchased the Turnberry resort from a Dubai-based company for an undisclosed sum.

5. Mar-a-Lago Club LLC

2019 Revenue: 21432344

2018 Revenue: $22692146

2019 Asset Value: Over $50000000

Business Type: Hotel and Resort

The Mar-a-Lago Club was built as a private mansion in 1927 by Marjorie Merriweather Post who inherited the Postum Cereal Company which later became the General Foods Corporation.

In 1968 she decided to donate Mar-a-Lago to the U.S. government to serve as a winter White House. When she died in 1973 the government refused the gift due to its high maintenance costs.

The estate was purchased by Trump in 1985 for a reported $8 million. He used it as a winter White House and continues to operate it as a private resort club.

2020 Challenges

The year 2020 was challenging for the former president's businesses because the COVID-19 pandemic hit the hospitality industry hard.

A study by the American Hotel & Lodging Association (AHLA) found that nearly nine in 10 hotels resorted to furloughs or layoffs in 2020. More than half of the hotel owners surveyed said they were in danger of losing their properties to foreclosure.

The Trump Organization laid off roughly 1500 employees due to COVID-19 as of the beginning of April 2020 including 560 at Trump National Doral.

Trump's largest business by revenue Trump National Doral had to close in March along with many of his other properties.

It reopened in June 2020 along with several other Trump hotels.

Trump's Failed Businesses

Trump's current businesses give only a partial picture of his record as a businessman. Over the course of his several decades as a real estate executive he has created a long list of companies that have been sold or dissolved or which have gone bankrupt.

Trump companies have filed for bankruptcy six separate times a fact Trump has bragged about saying he has ""used brilliantly the laws of the country.""

One Decade of Business Dealings

A useful snapshot is Trump's record during the 10 years before he won the presidency. From 2006–2016 The New York Times went through every business deal that the Trump Organization announced or that was reported.

The 60 deals reflected a highly uneven track record of business success: ""One-third of them never got off the ground or soon petered out. Another third delivered a measure of what was promised—buildings were built courses taught a product introduced—but they also encountered substantial problems like lawsuits government investigations partnership woes or market downturns...The remaining third while sometimes encountering strife generally met expectations"" according to The New York Times.

Any deeper examination of the former president's business record would be incomplete without looking at his series of high-profile bankruptcies and other failures. Below is a list of some of the highlights although it is by no means comprehensive.

Trump's Casinos

In the early 1990s Donald Trump faced personal bankruptcy due to large personal debts deteriorating finances and a trio of money-losing casinos in Atlantic City. His largest casino Trump Taj Mahal had already declared bankruptcy in 1991.

To deal with this Trump launched an initial public offering (IPO) of Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts. The public offering raised enough money for Trump to avoid personal bankruptcy and allowed him to offload his heavily indebted casinos to investors. Trump stepped down in 2009 as chairperson of the company whose name had been changed to Trump Entertainment Resorts in 2005.

By then the company had gone through bankruptcy twice and investors had lost ""well over 90 cents on the dollar"" according to billionaire Warren Buffett.

Trump Entertainment Resorts went back into bankruptcy in 2014 and was sold to Icahn Enterprises (IEP) in 2016 resulting in Trump losing his stake in the company. The Taj Mahal which Trump spent $1.2 billion to build in 1990 was later sold by Icahn Enterprises for $50 million or 4% of its cost to Hard Rock International in 2017.

Trump Model Management

Trump Model Management was a modeling agency Trump founded. The company is a natural extension of Trump's interest in beauty pageants with his production company formerly producing Miss USA pageants and a TV tie-in titled Pageant Place.

In April 2017 news that Trump Model Management would shut down surfaced after an email from the company's president leaked. Some speculate that the decision to shut down was due to the accusations from some foreign-born former models that they had been hired without the necessary work visas.

Trump Model Management denied using illegal labor practices. Trump himself held an 85% stake in the business before it dissolved.

The Trump Entrepreneur Initiative

The now-defunct Trump Entrepreneur Initiative was once known as Trump University. The for-profit education company offered courses in real estate asset management entrepreneurship and wealth creation.

The company was not an accredited school and did not offer high school or college credits.

The company was embroiled in an ongoing high-profile scandal during Trump's presidential campaign and it continued into his tenure as president.

The Trump Entrepreneur Initiative faced a lawsuit in 2013 alleging illegal business practices. The New York state attorney general filed a $40 million civil suit that alleged the corporation made false promises to its students.

A New York judge found Trump personally responsible. In late March 2017 when Trump was serving as president a judge approved a $25 million settlement for the defrauded students.

Trump Ice Natural Spring Water

Trump Ice was a bottled water brand. The winner of The Apprentice Season 2 Kelly Perdew served as executive vice president of the organization.

The company's website no longer exists and the product can no longer be found in national grocery chains or stores but some can still be found on eBay and other auction sites.

The company was used as a gimmick in the show's first season when contestants marketed and sold the product.

Trump Steaks

Launched in 2007 Trump Steaks was a line of beef products sold exclusively by The Sharper Image and QVC. Due to poor sales the products were removed from distribution after just two months.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRjZC5pZS9pbm5vdmF0aW9uL25ld3MtaXRlbXMvRGVjbGFuSVBQb2RjYXN0LnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,- Trinity Innovation,"

“Being a university that values and promotes academic entrepreneurship and innovation is incredibly important and we have that at Trinity”:

Dr Declan Weldon Head of the Office of Corporate Partnership and Knowledge Exchange (OCPKE) at Trinity College Dublin discusses opportunities for industry engagement

“OCPKE is an integrated team between industry consultancy and knowledge transfer a team that is professional and passionate.” Dr Declan Weldon leads this team which develops and supports relationships between industry and Trinity academics. Declan was recently invited to feature on the Tech Transfer IP Forum podcast which provides “in-depth analysis of intellectual property issues related to university and non-profit technology transfer.” The podcast is hosted by Lisa Mueller a thought leader on life science patent law and has previously featured primarily American speakers with Declan being the first contributor from Ireland invited to join. The conversation illuminated the achievements of the OCPKE team at Trinity College Dublin over the past five years and emphasises Ireland as key location for investors with Trinity as a hub for innovation and entrepreneurship.

Technology transfer can be thought of as the movement of information inventions materials or software from one organisation – in this case a university Trinity College Dublin – to another organisation often a company working on a project or developing an idea. It is related to “knowledge transfer” which encompasses the knowledge and scholarship from the Arts Humanities and Social Sciences in a university as well as science mathematics engineering and technology. At Trinity OCPKE puts the processes and structures in place to make such transference possible with highly beneficial results for both the university and the organisations involved.

The team’s mission according to Declan is “to promote Trinity as the partner of choice for industry in business to support access to Trinity intellectual property and to provide services to companies based on the wealth of knowledge and expertise available at the university.” The team has in place a “world-class infrastructure for industry collaboration whether that’s with global multinationals like Johnson and Johnson or with indigenous Irish companies and small to medium enterprises looking for assistance.”

Trinity has for example the latest MRI imaging equipment to develop medical device technology which many companies and organisations would find very valuable to access. Declan emphasises that as well as the equipment Trinity has “an academic community that is keen to work with industry and sees the distinct benefits of doing so and how that translates into more success in research funding and better teaching experiences for students.”



Declan has come “full circle” in returning to Trinity having completed his PhD in Chemistry at Trinity in the 1990s gone on to work for a company called Air Products & Chemicals in the U.S. Britain China and in Europe before returning to Trinity for this new role in technology and knowledge transfer. His team which are based within the larger team of Trinity Research and Innovation contains a wealth of experience and expertise from academic perspectives and backgrounds and also from the perspective of business industry engagement the protection and commercialisation of intellectual property (IP) and the legal necessities required for protected and structured relationships between industry and a university.

There are four managers on the team with expertise in specific areas to help academics at Trinity apply their research and IP to work with companies both in Ireland and internationally on a wide variety of projects. Dr Gordon Elliott looks after health sciences. Emma O’Neill works with academics from Life Sciences Biochemistry and Immunology. Dr Graham McMullin is responsible for Engineering Physics Chemistry and the Trinity centres AMBER and CONNECT. And Dr John Whelan works on Information and Communications Technology as well as the ADAPT and CONNECT centres.

They all work alongside the Licensing Manager Dr Sam Williams who is responsible for negotiating and finalising IP licence agreements across all disciplines as well as with paralegal officers Kate Toner and Lyn O’Reilly who look after legal agreements to cover confidential discussions and the sharing of data and materials. A key team member is Neil Gordon the Start-up Development Manager who is at the centre of relationship-building and advising Trinity academics who want to spin out their own company.

This team works together with the Industry Development Team spearheaded by Dr Chris Keely with the expertise of Audrey Crosbie and Dr Juan Valverde and soon to be joined by Tony O’Callaghan who is moving from Operations Executive into a leading new role in data analytics. Aoife Tierney is also leading in a new and exciting role in IP Development Management scoping out the IP landscape and identifying possibilities for progress.

Alongside this is the relatively newly-formed academic consultancy office CONSULT Trinity where Dr Joanne Conroy and Dr Kate Smyth support academics to apply their knowledge and expertise to various organisations including charities and Government departments.

Declan states that the team “really believes that there's great value for investors at Trinity College Dublin. We make it easy for our academic community industry partners and public service to work together. Our mission is to make it as open as possible for everyone to collaborate.” He says that “in the previous five years we've completed just over around 600 industry engagements with a wide variety of clients. One of our most important corporate relationships is with Intel Ireland who have repeatedly invested in fundamental research at Trinity which in turn then adds to Intel’s research roadmap.” So it can be very much a mutually beneficial relationship.

This work is supported by Enterprise Ireland which “offers a range of supports specifically aimed at developing research into commercialization potential at university. They are the primary source of funding for creating spin-outs from research in Ireland and typically a commercialization fund would be between 400 to 800000 Euros.” There is also European funding available from the European Research Council and from Horizon Europe which is “very much a gold standard in Europe” according to Declan. So he states “from the project in the lab to a commercialization stage there's a very healthy ecosystem here in Ireland to do that.” He also mentions the University Bridge Fund which was a fund “specifically aimed at spinouts from Irish universities.” It is a 60 million Euro fund built collectively by Irish universities and managed by Atlantic Bridge. The 25 companies involved in the previous five years “have raised 120 million Euro in equity and non-equity funding proving that the scheme is very successful.” Declan also mentions the support of Knowledge Transfer Ireland and its leader Allison Campbell who he says “has really been responsible for an uplift in knowledge transfer performance.”

He mentions the value of CONSULT Trinity as academic consultancy projects are often the “very first engagement the client will have with the university.” It allows for relationship-building and also provides opportunities to branch outside of traditional STEM sectors. CONSULT Trinity is branching out to offer support to academics from the Arts Humanities and Social Sciences (AHSS) to work with various organisations from SMEs to large multinationals to charities to Government departments. “Consultancy is a fantastic window into those Schools in AHSS to see what they're interested in doing and how they wish to work. And we're using that as a platform to expand activities into the Arts Humanities and Social Sciences.”

In the course of the conversation Declan discusses various new initiatives and activities that the team are working on and groups they’re collaborating with. One example is the Bush Institute in the Southern Methodist University in Dallas with whom the team is working to improve methods of measuring success and efficiency. Another major initiative is the Licensing Executives Society International. OCPKE Licensing Manager Sam Williams is the Ambassador for Britain & Ireland for the Women in Licensing Association (WILA) whose mission is to advance the growth of women in leadership through education mentoring and networking opportunities in the area of licensing. Improving gender equality in the field is a priority for the OCPKE team and for Trinity College Dublin more broadly with initiatives such as ATHENA SWAN ongoing which is “a recognition and reward system for positive gender practices in education.” Sam is a key leader in the successful licensing of IP and Declan states that “30% of our licensing repeat business and that's people saying we got value the first time.”

In the podcast Declan discusses significant successes in terms of Trinity campus companies such as Inflazome from Professor Luke O’Neill – now highly-regarded by the Irish public for his advice and expertise in relation to COVID-19 – and Matt Cooper from the University of Queensland. Their company was sold to Roche in 2020 “for an upfront payment of 380 million Euro” Declan states. This has significant benefits for the public because the company is “developing drugs that treat a whole range of chronic diseases all caused by inflammation so it’s really important that these drugs get to the market because tens of millions of people will benefit.”

Declan’s team are now looking at a new round of funding from the Technology Transfer Strengthening Initiative through Knowledge Transfer Ireland and are excited to see what possibilities lie ahead.

The tall white structure provided AT&T and T-Mobile customers with wireless reception during construction of The Jasper.

The recently completed upscale mixed-use building now houses a ""discreet"" replacement antenna on its roof ""to continue providing a reliable signal for the area"" according to Dan Doyle of The Beach Co. which built The Jasper on the site of the old Sergeant Jasper apartments.

The temp telecom tower went up in 2017 and it provided wireless service for the western half of Charleston’s lower peninsula ""that remained uninterrupted during the entire construction process"" Doyle said.

Its removal from the 2.3-acre corner lot signifies not only the completion of The Jasper but the start of The Beach Co.'s next construction venture in the area: The Charles a collection of luxury townhomes along Lockwood will overlook the Ashley River in the city’s Harleston Village neighborhood.

Plans show 19 four-story units ranging from 3550 square feet to 5000 square feet with private elevators in each.

The townhomes offer multiple floorplan options and 3½ to 4½ bathrooms. Prices start at $3.7 million for units that don't have water views according to the website.

However since the release of MIUI 12 there have been too many issues. The company had to release the MIUI 12.5 system which tackles most of the issues. However many users still believe that the MIUI 12.5 still does not live up to expectations. However as we know the Chinese manufacturer it is doing all it can to update the system.

Developer Prism Capital Partners said it has secured final site-plan approval from the city of Clifton New Jersey for a dual-branded Marriott AC/Element Hotel at ON3. The 266-room hospitality property will offer a rooftop bar and feature both limited-service and extended-stay options for patrons according to Prism which is headquartered on the ON3 campus. The seven-story structure will occupy a parcel that’s visible from state Route 3 along Metro Boulevard according to Prism.

The developer has transformed pharmaceutical giant Hoffmann-La Roche’s 116-acre former site which straddles Clifton and Nutley into a mixed-use site with an array of tenants. ON3 houses roughly 1.45 million square feet of existing office and lab research-and-development space that’s fully occupied or soon to be occupied by Japanese drugmaker Eisai Quest Diagnostics Ralph Lauren Modern Meadow Y-mAbs Therapeutics and Seton Hall University’s Graduate College of Nursing and School of Health and Medical Sciences.

Dual-branded hotels where two distinct hotel concepts are paired under one roof have been a trend in the hospitality industry but are fairly unusual in Northern New Jersey. They provide guests with a choice of different accommodations and price ranges for rooms at one location and allow hoteliers to save money by consolidating amenity space and “back-of-the-house” operations such as housekeeping and food and beverage service.

A dual-branded hotel a Hampton Inn & Suites and Homewood Suites two Hilton properties opened at the Glenpointe office complex in Teaneck New Jersey in 2018.

“The city of Clifton understands the immense benefits of a world-class mixed-use property; it has been a great partner in embracing our vision for ON3 and supporting the development needed to realize its full potential” Prism Principal Partner Eugene Diaz said in a statement. “The hotel and rooftop bar are long-missing amenities for this area and by securing the Marriott flag we continue to establish ON3 as a magnet for industry-leading brands.”

Late last year Clifton also approved a build-to-suit medical office building at the southeast corner of Metro Boulevard and Route 3 at ON3. The 80000-square-foot facility has been preleased to Hackensack Meridian Health which already occupies academic and R&D space at the campus including its School of Medicine and Center for Discovery and Innovation. The medical office building will include an ambulatory surgical center as well as additional multispecialty practice areas.

Prism said it expects that more than 5500 people will be employed at ON3 by the end of this year while the ongoing redevelopment also is creating hundreds of construction jobs.",,,,,,,,,

For a decade Tamara Ralph and Michael Russo were one of the most formidable couples in fashion with A-list clients including Gwyneth Paltrow Angelina Jolie and Kylie Minogue.

But explosive court documents seen by The Mail on Sunday claim their professional relationship disintegrated because Mr Russo bullied and harassed her after she attempted to stop him plundering vast sums from their company.

Earlier this month we revealed how both Ms Ralph and Mr Russo had been accused in legal documents of raiding millions of pounds from the renowned fashion label to bankroll their jet-set lifestyle.

For a decade Tamara Ralph (pictured) and Michael Russo were one of the most formidable couples in fashion with A-list clients including Gwyneth Paltrow Angelina Jolie and Kylie Minogue

We also reported allegations that Ralph & Russo's pension pot was raided before it plunged into administration in March and that £2.8 million was owed to the taxman. The Serious Fraud Office and Pensions Regulator have been alerted to allegations of financial wrongdoing.

Ms Ralph 39 who is being sued in the High Court by the company via its administrators for £20.8 million in damages has always denied the allegations. Now in extraordinary legal papers detailing her defence she claims:

Investigations discovered that Mr Russo spent company money in a casino in London's Mayfair and on renting a secret property in LA;

He used the label's money to fund a trip to Dubai where he booked adjoining penthouse hotel suites;

He went behind her back and bought a luxury Range Rover using company funds;

She attempted to block him from using the company's bank account;

Mr Russo launched a campaign of 'bullying harassment and abuse' against her;

The stress caused by Russo's conduct and from being sued by a company belonging to an investor caused Ms Ralph who was pregnant at the time to be hospitalised;

Mr Russo was sacked as the company's CEO last October due to his 'abusive conduct' towards her.

The glamorous designer of Meghan Markle's (pictured) £56000 engagement dress has accused her former business partner and boyfriend of stealing millions of pounds from their luxury fashion label Ralph & Russo contributing to its collapse

Australians Ms Ralph and Mr Russo founded their label in 2010. They won global acclaim in December 2017 after designing the black dress with beaded bodice worn by Meghan for her official engagement photos.

The court documents claim their romance ended in 2017 and their professional relationship 'steadily deteriorated from 2019 as a result of Mr Russo's discrimination abuse harassment and bullying of Ms Ralph'.

It is claimed that by late 2019 the company's chief financial officer had alerted Ms Ralph that 'large withdrawals of cash' were being made by Mr Russo 'which did not appear to be for business purposes'.

In February 2020 she was warned that the company was breaching an agreement that no more than £2.5 million could be paid out in so-called 'directors' loans'.

Ms Ralph says she told Mr Russo to stop withdrawing funds and 'repay the sums he owed'. But the documents claim she was ignored and that in March Mr Russo 'used company funds to book three first-class flights and interconnected penthouse hotel suites in Dubai'.

It is claimed that the following month Ms Ralph tried to stop Mr Russo's spending by insisting that both she and the company's chief financial officer approve any future payments but that he again refused to comply.

Ms Ralph says her attempts to challenge her business partner's conduct resulted in his 'campaign of bullying harassment and abuse' becoming increasingly hostile 'and escalated into repeated menacing statements that he wanted Ms Ralph to die'. She claims this caused her panic attacks.

In a further extraordinary twist Ms Ralph claims Mr Russo's alleged abusive conduct led to him being dismissed for gross misconduct on October 9 2020. The administrators last night claimed Mr Russo had already left the firm seven months earlier leaving Ms Ralph in 'sole charge' in the year before its collapse. A source close to Ms Ralph challenged this account however saying that Mr Russo and a new CEO served as directors during this period.

The administrators have accused Ms Ralph of spending thousands of pounds of the company's money on luxury hotels business-class flights lingerie yoga classes beauty treatments and hair appointments. But she denies stripping the company of its cash reserves and using its funds to bankroll an extravagant lifestyle. She says her use of the company's expense account was 'entirely transparent'.

Of the money she withdrew in so-called directors' loans she says she has repaid £316000 and intends to repay the outstanding £195000.

Explosive court documents seen by The Mail on Sunday claim their professional relationship disintegrated because Mr Russo (pictured) bullied and harassed her after she attempted to stop him plundering vast sums from their company

She blames her ex-partner for the millions that disappeared. 'Mr Russo abused his position as CEO and his access to the company's bank account and the associated bank card by misappropriating millions from the company and by taking steps to conceal these misappropriations' the legal papers say.

Ms Ralph who now lives in the South of France with her billionaire boyfriend Bhanu Choudhrie admits that the company bought a Rolls-Royce in 2017 but says that it was used for business purposes and she believed it would raise the company's profile. She claims Mr Russo used company funds to buy a Range Rover without her knowledge and then subjected her to 'serious abuse' when she objected.

Her legal papers also claim that Mr Russo used company funds to pay for two rental properties in London which appear to have been used by his girlfriend. And it is claimed the company was also paying for a rental property in Los Angeles that was falsely described as being located in Dubai where the label had opened a boutique.

Ms Ralph claims that earlier this year the administrators and property developer Nick Candy whose company Candy Ventures Sarl loaned the fashion house £17 million pressured her into continuing to work with Mr Russo who remained as a director despite being allegedly sacked as CEO. This pressure was applied despite 'detailed knowledge of Mr Russo's gross misconduct towards Ms Ralph' the defence document states.

The administrators Begbies Traynor Group and Quantuma Advisory Ltd said: 'Mr Russo exited the business in March 2020 (when he moved to Dubai) leaving Ms Ralph in sole charge from then onwards. As set out in the legal claim against her the abuse of pension money tax contributions and misuse of company funds took place on her watch from March 2020 until it went into administration on March 17 2021.'

Candy Ventures Sarl said: 'Over £70 million of investment has gone down the drain pension money has been stolen and the company accounts have been misrepresented. These are serious acts of financial misconduct and we look forward to the evidence being presented in the High Court.'

A former staff member said: 'I'm shocked by the legal claims against Tamara Ralph. It is unfathomable that company funds and pension contributions from hard-working staff could have been used to fund Tamara's extravagant lifestyle in the South of France when she should have been trying to save the company and save jobs.'

A spokesman for Mr Russo said the administrators were not taking legal action against him and he was not involved in any executive decision for almost a year before the company fell into administration.

He added: 'Mr Russo is both surprised and saddened that Tamara Ralph has chosen to make such serious misleading and false allegations against him as part of her defence to the claim against her from Ralph & Russo's administrators. Mr Russo worked tirelessly with Ms Ralph for more than a decade to build the company from zero into a global brand and has only the greatest respect and admiration for her.'

In a statement Tamara Ralph said: 'I will leave others to reflect on the irony of Ralph & Russo's female founder creative force and face of the brand being bullied unfairly blamed and targeted for financial mismanagement despite trying to prevent it. Furthermore to be victimized in a public smear campaign has been appalling.'",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vZ3VhcmRpYW4ubmcvc2F0dXJkYXktbWFnYXppbmUvcmFscGgtbGF1cmVuLXN0YXktYXdheS1mcm9tLXBlb3BsZS10aGF0LWJlbGl0dGxlLXlvdXItZHJlYW0v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ralph Lauren: Stay away from people that belittle your dream,"Mark Twain said: “Keep away from people who try to belittle your ambitions. Small people always do that but the really great make you feel that you too can become great. When you are seeking to bring big plans to fruition it is important with whom you regularly associate.” The fascinating rags-to-riches story of fashion mogul Ralph Lauren reveals a young aggressive kid starting his business with nothing but just a dream. With a net worth of US$ 7 billion (May 2021) it is hard to imagine that Ralph Lauren’s luxury label and privileged life style is a far cry from his modest upbringing.

Iconic fashion designer philanthropist and business executive Ralph Lauren was born Ralph Lifshitz in New York City on October 14 1939. Lauren worked in retail before developing a line of neckties. The brand he established Polo is now one part of an empire that includes fragrances home furnishings and luxury clothing.

Ralph’s love for elegant style and fine living was rivalled only by his drive for success. The determination to step away from his childhood misfortune was ever present from an early age. At the age of 12 he worked after school to find his extravagant taste in clothing and was known for selling hand-made ties to his fellow students at school. Little did he know this would become the driving force of his success as entrepreneur.

Lauren went to Baruch College where he studied business although he dropped out after two years. From 1962 to 1964 he served in the United States Army and left to work briefly for Brooks Brother as a sales assistant before leaving to become a salesman for a tie company. In 1966 when he was 26 he was inspired to design a wide European-style necktie but the idea was rejected by the company he worked for which dismissed it as not commercially viable.

As Ralph will later recall: “I went to my boss and I said ‘Sir I’d like to design these ties because I think they could be new.” His boss looked straight into his eyes with an eye of superiority and said: ‘The world isn’t ready for Lauren’. He never forgot that because he thought it was a compliment eventually he left to establish his own company. He took rags and turned them into ties selling them to small shops in New York. His major turning point was when he was approached by Neiman Marcus who bought 100 dozens. Drawing on his interests in sports Lauren named his first full line of menswear ‘Polo’ in 1968.

His motto ‘we don’t sell an item we sell a way of life’ certainly proved a point. The living legend stands for a dream-and it was a dream that certainly came true. In 2010 he was given one of the most celebrated national awards by French President Nicolas Sarkozy. He was declared Cheralier de la Legion d’honeur.

Life is undoubtedly full of amazing stories and for Lauren it is amazing how the depth of a man’s dream can miraculously transform him from a glove salesman to a multimillionaire. The man rose from nothing to become the 110th richest man in the world according to Forbes ranking in March 2021 with a net worth of $7.1billion. When all his contemporaries were struggling to be fashion designers he alone stood out as a passion designer! He once said: “I don’t like it when a woman looks like a fashion victim”.

Dare to dream big! Take a leap of faith and unleash your potentials. The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams. If you want to kill a big dream tell it to small-minded people. The most important thing after dreaming big is actually the people you tell it to. Small- minded people would make you settle for something lesser than your dream.

A small-minded person is unable to conceive a big future. A small mind will always strangulate a big dream. Never share your dreams with people who are incapable of seeing the big picture. Many dreams have been stifled and many latent potential have been perpetually buried just because some people planned their lives with people that lacked the ‘big picture’ view.

Stay around people that will stretch and inspire your thinking not those that will reduce your big dreams to their small thinking. The secret of great people is that they disciplined themselves to be far from small-minded people.

I want to inspire the youths not to only dream big but also take small steps towards achieving their dreams you are never too young to dream. Don’t ever give up on your dreams and when someone tells you “it can’t be done” it doesn’t mean you can’t do it it simply means you can’t do it with them. Don’t ever let somebody tell you “You can’t do something”. You have a dream to protect and the right to live your dream is in your hands. Albert Einstein once said: “I am thankful for all of those who said NO (it can’t be done) to me. It’s because of them I’m doing it myself.” Dream big; yes your dream needs to be big. It needs to be something that is seemingly beyond your capabilities. Never settle for less with your dream. Always ensure you upgrade your dream with respect to your inner conviction and not necessarily the present realities of things.",,,,,,,,,

On Friday the 43-year-old NFL star showed off his collection of championship rings after receiving one for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' Super Bowl LV victory earlier this year.

Brady unveiled his new bauble on social media accounts with his take on the popular ""How it started vs. How it's going"" meme posting a throwback photo taken from his early days playing for the New England Patriots juxtaposed with a snapshot of himself wearing the seven Super Bowl rings he's won in his career thus far.

""How it started vs How it's going"" he captioned the post.

Brady was drafted in 2000 and spent 19 years with the Patriots — during which he won six Super Bowls — before making his Buccaneers debut in 2020.

He nabbed his first championship win with the Buccaneers in February after beating out the Kansas City Chiefs 31-9.

According to the Buccaneers' website the team's Super Bowl ring features 319 diamonds to reflect the game's final score. It also includes a twist-off removable top with the word ""HISTORIC"" laser-etched in gold as well as a hand-engraved model of the Raymond James Stadium to commemorate the fact that the Buccaneers were the first team in NFL history to win a Super Bowl on their home turf.

After winning his latest Super Bowl Brady's wife Gisele Bündchen asked ""What more do you have to prove?""

When asked about that moment during an episode of The Late Late Show in late June Brady candidly admitted ""It's hard to walk away from something that you still feel like you can do and you wanna do. It's not about proving it to others what you can do it's more about proving it to yourself.""

""And I still feel like even though I'll be 44 for this year I still have a chance to still prove to myself that I can still do it at 44 because I really worked to a point where I can still do it at this age"" he told host James Corden.

While Brady now has more Super Bowl rings than any player in history he plans to continue playing football professionally until he's at least 45.

""Things change as you get older and there's a lot of different responsibilities I have in my life"" Brady explained on Wednesday's episode of SiriusXM Town Hall. ""My kids and my family is certainly very important and they made a lot of sacrifice over a long period of time to watch me play. So you know I owe it to them too.""

""I play because I love the game. I play because I love to compete"" he said. ""We shouldn't stop our life even though we love something because it's just someone puts an arbitrary timeline on that.""

""They were designed to be a trophy you wear on your finger"" Bucs quarterback Tom Brady said. (Tampa Bay Bucs )

TAMPA FL — When jewelry designers with Jason of Beverly Hills set out to create the Super Bowl LV championship rings for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers modesty wasn't a priority.

The rings were designed to make a statement. ""They were designed to be a trophy you wear on your finger"" Bucs quarterback Tom Brady said.

""The ring is amazing"" said Darcie Glazer Kassewitz of the Glazer family which owns the franchise. ""When you look at the ring you have no idea there's this special story inside.""

Kassewitz invited the players to help come up with the design.

""So we'd just won the Super Bowl. (Linebacker) Devin White came running up to me and said 'Darcie we've got to bling this (expletive) out"" Kassewitz said. ""There were a lot of decisions to be made"" said offensive guard Ali Marpet. ""I didn't even know how many decisions go into making a Super Bowl Ring.""



""One thing was clear to us - that the Glazer family wanted to have the best Super Bowl ring in history"" said Jason Arasheben owner of Jason of Beverly Hills. Details Of The LV Super Bowl Ring:

9 diamonds on the left represent the 9 points allowed in Super Bowl LV one of the fewest in NFL history. Tampa Bay Bucs 8 emerald-cut diamonds on each side represent eight straight wins the longest in franchise history that led to the Super Bowl LV win.

319 diamonds on the exterior top represent the 31-9 Super Bowl LV final score.

Each ring is personalized on one side with the player's name and jersey number. Beneath the jersey number are the words ""One Team One Cause"" the team's mantra under Coach Bruce Arians. Tampa Bay Bucs On the other side is the Super Bowl logo adorned with 4 diamonds representing the number of division winners defeated along with the team's name and Super Bowl score.

For the first time in NFL history the championship ring was designed with a removable top.

On the underside of the top is the word ""Historic"" commemorating the achievement of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers winning the Super Bowl at home in Raymond James Stadium on Feb. 7 2021.

Inside is a hand-engraved replica of Raymond James Stadium surrounded by the scores of the team's four playoff victories. The hand-engraved stadium celebrates the fact that the 2020 Buccaneers were the first team in NFL history to win the Super Bowl on their own field. The single diamond on the stadium field is placed on the spot where the Buccaneers ran out of the tunnel. Tampa Bay Bucs Engraved inside are the words ""Trust Loyalty and Respect."" ""Those are the characteristics you have to have on a championship team"" said wide receiver Mike Evans. How it started vs How it’s going pic.twitter.com/wbzeQNgjnX

Now it’s been confirmed that EVGA the GPU maker behind the cards that failed is going to replace all those 3090s ruined by the MMO.

PC Gamer was told directly by EVGA that it is planning to replace every single RTX 3090 card destroyed by New World. A spokesperson told PC Gamer matter of factly that “Yes all failed 3090’s are being replaced.”

The site also pointed out that YouTuber JayTwoCentz has reported that his contacts at EVGA say the cards should be shipping out already. According to him the company had a stock of RTX 3090s on hand for replacements.

New World is an MMORPG being developed and published by Amazon. Unlike Amazon’s other attempts at making video games this one seems to be popular and successful. (It might even survive longer than a year!) Currently Amazon is running a closed beta of the game. Earlier this week some unfortunate folks that jumped in to try the game out before its August 31 launch walked away with completely dead EVGA RTX 3090 GPUs. Luckily well for everyone else it seems that only EVGA cards were being destroyed by the New World beta.

Shortly after the beta started bricking cards that can cost upwards of $2000 (or more if bought on the secondary market) Amazon patched the game to fix the issue. I probably don’t have to tell you but these high-end GPUs ca n be nearly impossible to find these days leading to wild crowds and huge prices on sites like eBay.

After patching the game Amazon sent a statement to Kotaku that the beta was “safe to play.” I think a bunch of people with dead EVGA cards would probably disagree with that statement.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWdhbWVyLmNvbS9maW5hbC1mYW50YXN5LTEwLXJlbWFrZS00ay1ydHgtdHJhaWxlci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,4K RTX Final Fantasy 10 Remake Trailer Made By Fan,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWdhbWVyLmNvbS9maW5hbC1mYW50YXN5LTEwLXJlbWFrZS00ay1ydHgtdHJhaWxlci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pZ29yc2xhYi5kZS9lbi9ldmdhLWdlZm9yY2UtcnR4LTMwODAtcnR4LTMwOTAtYW5kLW5vdC1vbmx5LW5ldy13b3JsZC13aGVuLXRoZS1ncmFwaGljcy1jYXJkLWdvZXMtYW1vay1iZWNhdXNlLW9mLWRlc2lnbi1mYWlsdXJlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,EVGA GeForce RTX 3080 RTX 3090 and (not only) New World - when design flaws cause graphics cards to run amok ...,"1 - EVGA and a Design Flaw in their Fan Control 2 - General Issues with extra high FPS and a Conlusion

Disclaimer: The following article is machine translated from the original German and has not been edited or checked for errors. Thank you for understanding!

Thanks to a very large amount of reader feedback and targeted testing it was possible to reproduce the scenario in a largely plausible and reliable manner. This is also proven by the damage picture I already reported in my first article and it also shows that you have to be very careful with even too sweeping snapshots on the Internet even if it is of course always tempting and goes viral quickly especially on YouTube. That’s exactly why I have to put something here first also in the hope that at least this time it will be read.

Important preliminary remark – facts and symptoms

Do you still remember my three(!) articles about the capacitor problem (“POSCAP-Gate”) of the then freshly launched GeForce RTX 3080 and the instabilities that occurred? I had taken the trouble to provide all three articles with a special preface pointing out that one should not generalize the analyzed contents in a sweeping and detached way and that it all has to be seen in context. But it is always such a thing with appropriate quotations and in the end many media with a wide reach no matter whether YouTube or classic websites only picked out what promised the biggest quota.

However this not only distorts technical reality but also creates supposed facts that never existed in this form. Exactly the same thing is happening right now with all the media hubbub about Amazon’s “New World” and the dying EVGA cards. I don’t want to judge whether many reports were made out of technical incomprehension and / or pure click-haggling but I consistently miss the separation into a really existing design error (hardware) and the generally known fact that many of the current graphics cards reach their limit anyway at too high FPS numbers and thus also the area of the gripping protection circuits (software). Once again one has NOTHING to do with the other. Apples and oranges.

Moreover the greater the range the more people will be found who want to have experienced what has been described superficially and who will speak out. Except that a tripped protection circuit on a Radeon card is logically something completely different than a blown controller chip on a botched board design. The protection circuit is there exactly for such a thing only that with the fan one must question evenly. And at this point I get angry when one lumps everything together and celebrates the quota because the hardware problem at EVGA cards does not only affect “New World” but is of a general nature!

EVGA and the faulty fan controller

So let’s get back to EVGA and the misconstructed fan controller that’s really the harsh way to put it. Here my thanks go especially to a reader who was able to help me with analytical expertise and effort and also risked his hardware for the reproduction. The problem in the area of the fan control is also known to EVGA for months (!) but they have so far sat it out apparently inactive. The various messages in the EVGA forum or the mails to EVGA were ignored for whatever reason.

The statement of EVGA that they can’t reproduce the problem now after the patch of “New World” unfortunately no more is besides also contentwise completely wrong because one can it. And not just in the deliberate menu with the thousands of FPS but even in the game itself. I will produce a video on this topic in the near future which will also contain the recordings (“screen copy”) but I will use still images from these recordings for this article. The FPS rates are not limited and range between 50-70 FPS in the selected scene. Everything seems to run normally on the GeForce RTX 3080 FTW (10G-P5-3891-KR – EVGA 3080 FTW3 Ultra) for now:

But even now the fan controller periodically runs amok for a few seconds. The higher the FPS the more violent the fan whine and the frequency of these technical failures of the card. Under normal circumstances however the player will hardly notice it because the freak-outs are too short at FPS rates below 100 FPS to drive the sluggish fans to maximum performance. But even now it’s easy to log:

And EVGA doesn’t want to be able to reproduce that? It is exactly the conscious fan #1 that is the one above the GPU which is driven here completely senseless. So in general it doesn’t make a difference if the frames are limited by a limiter or natural load because it occurs at 60 as well as at 144+ FPS. What has always helped the reader so far was to lower the power limit from 100% to 50-60% at least on “New World”. Then again it was on.

What EVGA could have figured out even after the patch and what is really interesting in this context is that the card ignores any manual setting of the fan control in this situation. It does not matter if the fans are set to 50% RPM as a fixed value or if a manually created fan curve is stored. The ride into insanity always begins and the error pattern is always the same. But if there are already errors at 60 FPS what about at 6000 FPS++? That’s exactly what you don’t even want to think about anymore.

Also the VBIOS version did not play a role here so far. As proof the reader tested the “stock VBIOS” the “450 Watt OC version” and the “ResizeBAR” variant on his GeForce RTX 3080 FTW. In addition it makes no difference whether the BIOS switch is set to “Normal” or “OC” where the semi-passive mode is replaced by a fixed minimum speed of 1000 RPM at idle. It also makes no difference to the error.

It is NOT a special “New World” problem after all

Again we have to disagree with EVGA and many colleagues. It just suddenly became more noticeable because the FPS numbers were disproportionately high which also led to the aforementioned hardware damage in places. However we also have to add here that one of the bricked GeForce RTX 3090 additionally relied on a shunt mod. The fact that you’re undermining all of the GPU’s protections with it should be left aside because mods like this don’t do anyone any good unless you want to have the longest and risk damage.

I also have a second video where you can see the same thing happening here! If you open the menu or the tooltip on the bottom right in Anno 1800 the fans start to take on a very strange life of their own. In this case it is even clearly audible how fan #1 (because we just had) briefly starts up to 100% and immediately throttles back again. The third fan which is called the “EVGA iCX Right Fan” is not affected by this. The FPS were throttled to 60 in the game on purpose.

However it also happens in this game that the fans keep howling and you have to close the game immediately before a blackout and the well-known emergency shutdown happens shortly after. In this case the only thing that can be done is to disconnect the computer from the mains and wait a few seconds to be able to boot it again. This in turn indicates an emergency shutdown by the power supply which proves that the card must have demanded an abnormal amount of power in this situation.",,,,,,

As our society’s sense of common goals and shared values frays mainstream liberals in particular have been increasingly seduced by the idea that Big Brother should be called into action to monitor and squash thought crime wherever it may emerge.

It’s the perfect time then for the nuanced and forceful takedown of censorship at the heart of the new horror film “Censor.” The debut feature by director Prano Bailey-Bond is first and foremost a brilliant and mind-altering film a magnetic character study in the form of a nightmarish Lynchian hallucination. See it regardless of your interest in censorship as a social issue.

But what elevates it from a fun horror film to a piece of art is its exploration of the dangerous dance between trauma and repression for individuals and society as a whole. Those threads entwine through Enid the film’s main character (though certainly not its hero) who works as a censor in the bleak bureaucratic offices of the British Board of Film Classification. Niamh Algar brings an amazing and menacing subtlety to her depiction of Enid projecting a schoolmarmish uprightness while showing through tiny hints and hesitations that it’s all a delicate facade.

The film is set in the mid-1980s when the conservative Margaret Thatcher administration stoked a wave of paranoia over the danger of “video nasties”. These were mostly violent B-movies unleashed as the rise of video technology removed theaters’ gatekeeping powers – a striking parallel to the panic around social media today. In a bid to essentially fight the free flow of culture the U.K. government imposed state film censorship in 1984.

The film exaggerates and personalizes the video nasty moral panic masterfully in one of its two plotlines. When a murderer appears to have mimicked a violent film that Enid chose not to censor she becomes the target of a wave of misplaced harassment: The public blames her for the crime instead of the murderer. At the same time we are shown the economic and social decline that beset the U.K. in the 1970s and 1980s which the film suggests is the deeper cause of violence. Political commentators have argued that the Thatcherites were intentionally ginning up anti-video anger as a distraction from these material problems.

Story continues

Parallel to those events “Censor” reveals that not all is right with Enid herself. In a series of jittery oblique (that is very British) interactions with her aging parents we learn that Enid’s sister went missing long ago while the pair were out wandering the woods. Enid has seemingly erased her own memories of that day a kind of self-censorship that mirrors her work cutting violent scenes out of films.

And just as the ginned-up panic over video nasties misdirects anger from a bleak reality onto the media that reflects it Enid’s disconnection from reality takes her to some very dark places. I won’t spoil anything but this is a horror movie and Chekhov’s axe will inevitably come into play.

The return of the (financially) repressed

“Censor” is a movie with a message though one that’s messy and contradictory and ambiguous enough to avoid preachiness. The film wants you to walk away skeptical of the power of forgetting censorship and other forms of denial to control the evil in the world and in ourselves.

Pioneering psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud called this “the return of the repressed.” Freud believed that repression a kind of internal censorship of trauma or unpleasantness left negative experiences to fester and mutate in the shadows of our individual psyches manifesting as uncontrollable tics or psychosomatic disorders. Freud’s development of psychoanalysis the “talking cure” was based on the idea that by bringing buried truths to light people could be more integrated confident happy selves.

What if the same dynamics apply not just to the repression of memories or the censorship of videos but to the control of money? The ills of financial censorship are at the very heart of the cryptocurrency project from Satoshi’s emphasis on irreversibility in the Bitcoin white paper to the beautifully simple observation by Coin Center’s Jerry Brito that “Without cryptocurrency a cashless society is a surveillance society.”

We can clearly see these risks unfolding in real time through an idea that emerged in response to cryptocurrency – the central bank digital currency (CBDC) which has huge utility for financial monitoring and censorship. That’s why China has been most aggressive in pursuing the technology but clearly it’s appealing even in nominally democratic societies. Look no further than recent statements from Agustin Carstens head of the Bank for International Settlements who seemed to praise CBDCs for the “absolute control” they would give central banks.

You can certainly understand the motives of these aspiring financial censors. It sounds very convenient to be able to simply flip a switch and take away all the ill-gotten gains of violent drug cartels or cut off every donation to a terrorist group. It would be even better if we could cut off the elaborate money-laundering schemes pursued by the world’s most powerful and supposedly respectable people though you might suspect central banks controlled by elites aren’t the best tools for that job.

The killer is already in the house

But as with Enid’s censorious faith the belief that centralized financial control will lead to a crime-free utopia is a self-defeating delusion. And we’re living through an experiment that proves it.

Following 9/11 and the 2008 financial crisis new regulations were put into place that heightened scrutiny of everyday financial activity to fight money laundering. That pushed major banks in the developed world to drop a variety of relationships particularly with international correspondent banks international nonprofits and “money services businesses” which include many fintechs.

In essence they decided to take the same approach to anti-money-laundering (AML) measures that Enid’s boss tells her to take to film censorship: “If you have any doubts whatsoever reject the film.” Or in this case the customer.

In a 2015 report the charitable organization Oxfam chronicled the widespread fallout from this “de-risking” in the global financial system. The report argues that the impacts have been in some ways the exact opposite of regulators’ intent. On the one hand the developing world’s loss of access to global finance has worked against AML goals. De-risking has pushed greater portions of the global economy including perfectly legitimate commerce to smaller banks with less oversight or even into the underground or “informal” realm. That makes it more difficult for law enforcement to spot genuine criminal activity.

At the same time Oxfam found that banking censorship has created problems for economies reliant on international remittances and made it increasingly difficult for international charitable organizations to maintain financial relationships in trouble zones. This is where the vicious cycle of financial censorship can be seen most clearly.

The primary goal of bank controls after all is to limit tax evasion terrorist financing and illegal commerce in drugs and guns. The last two are the result of poverty and discontent which as Oxfam shows bank de-risking is making worse. Stricter AML measures surely have some impact on holding international crime in check but by strangling remittances to countries like Syria and Sudan bank de-risking has likely driven individuals towards drug-running arms dealing and terrorism because of a lack of options in the legitimate economy.

In other words efforts to reduce bank liability through tight AML controls may be increasing the risk of real crime on the ground. It is an act of repression and forgetting not a solution to the real problems.

The dreamlike blood-soaked climax of “Censor” shows the endgame of that sort of willful blindness. When Enid’s personal horror breaks through the repressive shields she relied on for sanity the outcome is far worse than if she had simply confronted the truth. We as a society are flirting with the same violent chaotic eruptions when we refuse to fully reckon with the human reality on the ground and instead simply try to push inconvenient truths further into the shadows.

The successful businesswoman is passionate to involve more women in the real estate sector through her new initiative Women in Real Estate Africa (WIRE) which will be launched soon. In this interview with IFEOMA OKEKE speaks on her vision to redefine the industry and how women and youths transform the industry. Excerpts:

You are focused on middle-income real estate and you are very passionate about middle-income earners owning their homes early enough in life. What fueled this passion?

My passion for middle-income ownership started when I was an employee. I was earning significantly well had a good official car could go on summer holidays with my kids lived well ate well and so on but I could not put together bulk monies to own my own house because all real estate adverts I saw required that I deposited a significant amount of funds upfront; which I did not have. The payment requirements were out of sync with my income pattern. So as much as I desired to own a home home ownership became a mirage. I didn’t get my first home until I started working for myself and could pull up bulk funds in business transactions. Fast-forward to the commencement of my real estate company we decided to focus on middle-income real estate and our passion is to consistently help middle-income earners achieve homeownership using strategies that are in tandem with the income/earnings pattern.

Aside from the fact that the real estate industry has become lucrative it seems to be more saturated; so how have you been able to be distinctive with your brand?

First the real estate industry in Nigeria is not saturated. The singular reason is this; if you put the number of houses built against the number of homes that should be built per annum to cover the over 20 million housing deficit in the country you will find out that we are not even scratching the surface of recovery numbers. However there needs to be a redistribution of clientele focus. We need more developers moving into the lower-middle-income housing and affordable housing spaces; which are where the large “housing deficit” numbers lie. Now we have been able to distinguish ourselves by providing home-purchase solutions that are tailored towards affordability for the average middle-income earner. This business strategy stands us out in a Blue Ocean and we have our target market; which requires this bespoke service. These are the average upwardly mobile professionals – mostly from Generations Y and Z.

You have not only become a successful realtor but a vision breeder especially for women in this industry. How do you intend to help women achieve more in the Nigerian Real estate sector?

I am currently working with my team for the official launch of WIRE Africa (Women in Real Estate Africa) in the 4th quarter of 2021. The main motivation for WIRE Africa is summarised in the statement of T.D. Jakes to the next generation beckoning on the players in the different industries to rise and take the bull by the horn and produce a template of success for successive generations still coming behind them. WIRE Africa is an association that seeks to build the next generation of formidably successful women in the real estate industry in Africa who would step on the foundation being laid by the women that have shown that success as a woman in the real estate space is possible. The focus would be on current young women operating businesses in the real estate value chain–real estate development real estate transaction advisory real estate legal advisory real estate marketing advisory architecture real estate marketing mortgage brokerage real estate valuation and real estate branding. The thrust is to create a platform that empowers educates and allows women to collaborate in the industry to foster a culture of success for women in real estate in Africa starting from Nigeria.

How have you been able to achieve your aim with your initiative Women in Real Estate (WIRE)?

The official launch was initially scheduled for November 2020 but the COVID-19 realities resulted in a delay in commencement. However plans are currently fully underway to ensure that this initiative kicks off effectively within the next few weeks. I urge women in real estate to watch out for details in the next quarter.

The economy of the country has not been friendly especially for stakeholders in this sector. What is the fate of realtors as the prices of building materials skyrocket?

Inflation in Nigeria at 17.93 percent (March 2021) coupled with the devaluation of the Naira presents a challenge for most industries and not just the real estate sector. However a major issue for real estate developers is the fact that many projects that had been sold at certain prices to off-takers have now been negatively impacted by the increased prices of building materials. This slims the expected profit margins and in some instances throws the projects into loss-making transactions. Some developers have therefore had to resort to sending upward price revision notices to their buyers; as that is the only way they would be able to cover costs and complete the projects successfully.

Ultimately whenever the prices of building materials increase prices of homes and commercial real estate go up in tandem. Therefore we expect to see prices of real estate escalate over the next 12 to 36 months and the market would self-regulate eventually.

Has the security challenges of the country posed any threat to the progress of the industry?

Security challenges in any clime adversely affect the performance and potential expansion of most industries within that jurisdiction. So in the instance of real estate the security challenges pose a threat to the growth of the real estate industry; especially in the places that are significantly affected by the insurgency. In addition to this the security challenges would negatively impact the potential for Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in the real estate sector in the country. This could further stunt the portion of the growth in the real estate sector that could otherwise have been fueled by the influx of offshore finance.

You are a medical doctor-turned-realtor how do you feel about the switch?

Rule No.1; pursue your constructive passions once you recognise them! However I still look forward to doing a lot of things that touch on my first-degree training as a doctor. Some of those include having niche projects related to the medical sector such as massive hospital constructions medical villages in which doctors would have home purchase discounts and so on. So yes I have switched careers but I still intend to switch on the cross-over hat as the years go by with these types of medically-linked projects.

Aside from your success in real estate and properties you are also a restaurateur and a motivational speaker. How have you been able to combine all these without clashes?

It is all about structure! I have put business structures in place that allow my businesses to run effectively without me having to be in them 24/7. This is my moment to give a shout-out to the members of my teams who work tirelessly to ensure that the organisations succeed. It is amazing how hard and smart they work; whether I am there or not. On this one the accolades go to my teams! They have been phenomenal. When I count my blessings I count them twice.

You are a workaholic; how do you define your leisure?

I need to do some more work on personal leisure! I need to remind myself that I need rest from time to time. However for now my best “relaxation strategy” is going to the spa for a good massage. I am literally a regular with regards to that. It calms my nerves. Aside from this my hobbies are singing to myself and reading.

You recently clocked 40 would you say you have achieved your dreams and what are your aspirations going forward?

I would say God has been faithful to me. As for aspirations the next decade is a focus on consolidation and a greater focus on maximising opportunities as I move towards 50. Also I would be heightening my focus on giving back to my world especially with a focus on younger women coming behind; by consciously demonstrating a template that they can also replicate as they move up the ladder of success. Above all as I have always done I have presented my written goals to God who has always been the Doer for His direction and help as I go on to execute the strategies He has placed in my heart.",,,,,,,,,

Bayfront Health Community Pillar Contribution

BROOKSVILLE Florida July 15 2021- Patients with rectal tumors now have a new treatment option that may significantly improve quality of life. Previously patients with rectal tumors that couldn’t be removed via colonoscopy required invasive surgery that often resulted in significant alterations to their anatomy.

However George Tsai M.D. FACS general surgeon with Bayfront Health Medical Group recently performed a trans-anal minimally invasive surgery (TAMIS) at Bayfront Health Brooksville. Dr. Tsai resected a tumor the size of a potato without complication.

“The modern surgery approach is to be less invasive without compromising the surgical outcomes of more invasive traditional procedures said Tsai. “With previous surgical options the balance of complete disease removal and quality of life had been hard to maintain. Complications frequently required a colostomy.”

As a result of this minimally invasive technique the Bayfront Health Brooksville patient was able to go home after overnight observation and resume all activity quickly.

A specialized TAMIS device is placed inside the anal canal to provide the surgeon access to the rectum which is inflated with carbon dioxide gas (similar to a colonoscopy) to offer the surgeon visibility and optimal working space. A high-definition camera and specialized laparoscopic instruments are placed through the TAMIS device allowing the surgeon to operate with precision. The tumor is removed and the rectum is repaired internally to allow the wall of the rectum to heal.

Dr. George Tsai attended medical school at Drexel University College of Medicine in Philadelphia. He performed his residency at Christiana Care Health System in Delaware. Having practiced as a general surgeon for more than 22 years Dr. joined Bayfront Health Medical Group in February of 2020. He received additional training from surgeons and gastroenterologists with a subspecialty focus on foregut motility.

Masks are no longer mandatory visitors are arriving from all over Canada and house parties can have up to 50 people.

But there are other signs that some Islanders aren't comfortable going back to the pre-COVID days just yet. A quick scroll through social media suggests the easing of restrictions is a divisive topic on P.E.I.

The government has said it is up to individual businesses if they want to continue with certain measures. That discretion has left some business owners reluctant to speak about how they would approach the easing of restrictions.

However there are some things people may have noticed that show life is getting back to normal.

The plastic separators customers use to make sure they don't get someone else's groceries are back in use at Sobeys. (Shane Ross/CBC)

You don't have to worry about going home with someone else's milk and eggs anymore. The little plastic bars customers place between their grocery orders on the checkout conveyor belts are back at some stores including Sobeys.

So are the hand-held grocery baskets for those who prefer not to use the big shopping carts.

Some stores have decided to keep the directional arrows that let customers know which way to walk down aisles. (Shane Ross/CBC)

People who crave order in their lives will be happy to know that some places including the Superstore and Sobeys are keeping arrows on the floor to remind customers which way to go down the aisles — at least for the time being.

Some other stores have removed them so enter those aisles at your own risk.

Gym members no longer need to bring their own water to GoodLife — the fountains are flowing again. (Shane Ross/CBC)

Water fountains are back in use at some gyms such as Good Life in Charlottetown. Towel service which was also suspended during COVID-19 is also back.

And the saunas have reopened at The Spa Total Fitness Centre with limited occupancy.

You no longer have to give out your name and number for contact tracing purposes at some stores though some restaurants have decided to keep it for now. Also expect the hand sanitizers at the door to remain in place.

The middle urinal is back in business in at least one public washroom in Charlottetown. (Shane Ross/CBC)

The middle urinal at a Charlottetown public restroom is no longer taped off. It's still proper etiquette to choose one on the end though.

Some dental offices no longer require you to call from the parking lot before getting your cavities filled.

Other businesses including some veterinarians are keeping the practice in place. And don't be surprised if you're still asked to put on a mask.

Baskets for clean and used pens remain at the entrance of St. Dunstan's Basilica in Charlottetown. (Shane Ross/CBC)

Masks are no longer required at church services but at St. Dunstan's Basilica communion bread will still be delivered with physical distancing in place. Visitors are still asked to sign in using a pen from the ""clean"" basket.

Golfers can no longer blame the pin for those missed putts. Some golf clubs are now allowing golfers to remove the pin when they're on the green but to limit contamination they ask that only one person in the group be the designated flag puller for the full 18 holes.

Some taxi drivers would still prefer their customers wear masks. (Shane Ross/CBC)

Some taxi drivers are still requesting passengers to mask up as well so it might be a good idea to carry one just in case — unless you plan to walk home.

Organized gatherings hosted by a business or organization can now have cohorts of 100 people indoors. For bingo halls that means the big plastic divider separating the old cohorts of 50-max can come down. It's always good to see the competition.

It's easy and will only take a moment.

Artist Sherril Fraser has immortalised local heroes during one of the most unforgettable periods in living memory.

UNSUNG heroes who continued to serve a Ross-shire community during the coronavirus pandemic have been immortalised by an artist keen to celebrate the work of ordinary people who quietly made a big difference during difficult times.

Sherril Fraser's key worker portraits – which are now on display at the Beachfront Gallery Portmahomack – capture likenesses of posties a long-serving firefighter and the owner of a local post office and stores.

Ms Fraser who was born in Portmahomack and returned to the village after growing up in Oxfordshire and time spent living in Edinburgh was inspired by artist Tom Croft. He painted NHS key worker portraits in an initiative which captured the public imagination and inspired other artists to join in producing a memorable body of work that reflected public gratitude to those putting their lives on the line every day.

She said: ""It was his way of saying thank you and celebrating the work of those in the front line in the fight against coronavirus.

""My portraits are not of NHS workers but still key workers who carried on providing a service to us throughout these difficult times.The subjects were nominated by local people because they had made a difference to the area and the community by continuing to provide a great service with a smile.""

Will Paterson volunteer firefighter for 46 years and founding member of BalintoreCommunity Response Unit.

These include William Paterson a volunteer firefighter who was a founding member of Balintore Community Response Unit (CRU) and is proud to be serving his community 46 years after the station began to operate.

Also featured are Portmahomack post office and store owner Vicky Taylor and Susan Judge a postwoman serving Rockfield and surrounding area. Michael Fox who also served as a postie is featured too.

Ms Fraser said: ""I wish I could have painted Vicky without the face mask to show her smile but the photo used as reference was the one posted by her to remind customers that a face mask would be mandatory on May 15 2020. For this reason it is and always will be a reminder of coronavirus and all that went with it. There are many other local people who have gone above and beyond in the last year aside from this group and who also deserve a thank you from us all.""

All the portraits have been created using pastel and charcoal on watercolour board and go up to 56cm x 65cm in size.

The portraits have been gifted to their subjects and loaned to the gallery for display until August 10.

The work was completed in pastel and charcoal on watercolour board.

The gallery is open Friday to Sunday 11:30am to 3:30pm and has lots of other local art on display.

Ms Fraser meantime is preparing for a 2022 exhibition of her work scheduled for the Alchemist gallery in Dingwall from July 7 to August 23 next year.

""What a s--- show of a job you have!"" comedian Josh Ocean Thomas said in response.

Thomas a San Diego native who moved to the Midwest to pursue comedy shared a clip of the exchange during his recent set at The Laugh Factory in Chicago on Instagram earlier this week where it has gone viral.

""You work for the Biden administration? Is your job to wake him up or what’s your job?"" Ocean asked ""Nick"" as the audience erupted into laughter.

BIDEN VOWS TO WITHHOLD WEAPONS FROM ISRAEL IF NETANYAHU GOES FORWARD WITH RAFAH INVASION

Miming a fictional Biden staffer trying to get the president’s attention he exclaimed ""Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! There’s a war! Hey!""

The bit continued with Thomas asking Nick what he really does for Biden. Before he could respond the comic remarked ""What a s--- show of a job you have. I can’t believe you admitted that in front of all these people.""

""You have the freedom to lie. You could have said you were a hooker and I would’ve been prouder of you"" he added.

The alleged Biden staffer started to tell Thomas that he travels to southern states before the comic interrupted with a burst of laughter.

""That’s crazy! You go to the south and try to sell ‘em on Biden? You’re f----- r------! What the f---? What are you talking about?"" he said. ""That’s your f----- job? Is to go ‘Hey listen I know you guys like Trump but Biden. I mean…’""

BIDEN WARNS NETANYAHU AGAINST RAFAH INVASION AS ISRAEL PREPARES FOR ACTION

The clip ended with one last joke as Thomas asked ""Wow. Are you ready to be unemployed? Or what’s your vibe?""

Thomas captioned the video writing ""This was my only option.""

Thomas wasn't the only comic to take aim at Biden this week.

Anti-Trump comedian Michael Rapaport torched the president in a video he shared to X on Thursday in which he officially declared he would not be supporting Biden’s re-election after the world leader told CNN he would not send weapons to Israel if it invades Rafah Hamas' last stronghold in Gaza.

Kennedy Jr.’s running mate complained on Thursday that she was “slandered” and had to “take a walk to shake it off.”

Shanahan who has been bankrolling RFK Jr.’s spoiler-ready campaign for president with the fortune she got in her divorce from Google founder Sergey Brin did not raise any specific objection to the story which she said she didn’t read until nearly a full day after it was published.

But she did go into detail about an almost cinematic encounter she had on her walk when she “pulled into a farmers market to say hello to the farmers.”

“I walked by a young man on the empty side of the parking lot who recognized me and said ‘Nicole Shanahan!’ and said he was a supporter of Bobby and watched my speech” she wrote on X.

“He said he studied the psychology of politics in college. I told him about the article and how I was trying to walk it off. He told me he had watched the ‘Who is Bobby Kennedy’ film which is specifically about how cruel and embarrassingly desperate the left-wing media can be.”

“He’s 23 years old. I looked up at the sky and then said to this young man ‘thank you you are just what I needed in this moment to keep going strong.’ His name is Alex. Thank you Alex.”

The Daily Beast reached out to the Kennedy campaign after her post but did not get an immediate response. The Daily Beast could not reach Alex because no last name was provided but he can contact us at tips@thedailybeast.com at any time.

The story that Shanahan appeared to be referring to detailed her meteoric rise from a turbulent childhood in Oakland California to the wife—and then ex-wife—of one of the richest men in the country as well as the running mate of a conspiracy theory-driven third-party presidential candidate who could hand the election to Donald Trump.

The Beast story the result of more than a dozen interviews and several weeks of work was highlighted by top tech journalist Kara Swisher on Threads on Thursday. In particular Swisher noted that a source who has spent significant time with Shanahan scoffed at Kennedy’s description of her as an artificial intelligence expert with the source saying that she “couldn’t differentiate ‘AI from a tennis ball.’”

Swisher then went on to add “And more: Unsuccessful entrepreneur losing lawyer bloviating nonsense on all manner of things she has no expertise in marriage incompetence and she’s just plainly a candidate for a thirsty wack job because she managed to get a pile of money from a tech billionaire who wanted her to go away.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMTAvYXJ0cy90ZWxldmlzaW9uL2Z1bGwtY291cnQtcHJlc3Mtd25iYS10di5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Caitlin Clark Hype Will Test the W.N.B.A.'s Television Limits,"The decision makers for the docuseries “Full Court Press” chose wisely when selecting which women’s college basketball players they would follow for an entire season.

They recruited Caitlin Clark whose long-distance shots at the University of Iowa made her a lucrative draw. Kamilla Cardoso a Brazilian attending the University of South Carolina could provide an international perspective. Kiki Rice from the University of California Los Angeles would be the talented but reserved young prospect.

Those selections proved fortuitous when each player advanced deep into the N.C.A.A. tournament. Clark and Cardoso competed in the most-watched women’s championship game in history before becoming two of the top three picks in the W.N.B.A. draft.

Biden’s team however argued in court that this ban violates the Second Amendment. They pointed to a recent Supreme Court decision New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen which constrained the government’s power to regulate gun ownership.

Judge Maryellen Noreika however was unpersuaded. Norieka who was appointed by then-President Donald Trump noted that while the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals found the drug-user ban to be unconstitutional in one situation — specifically as applied to a habitual marijuana user — that court explicitly emphasized that its decision was quite narrow. And she wrote that the “vast majority” of district courts who have reviewed the drug-user ban in the post-Bruen world have upheld it as constitutional.

She added that Biden can still challenge the constitutionality of the statute as it was applied to him once his trial is complete.

In a separate ruling also handed down on Thursday Noreika ruled against a motion Biden had filed seeking documents the Justice Department possesses involving communications between or among Donald Trump former Attorney General William Barr and other Trump-era senior department officials regarding the Biden case.

Earlier Thursday a three-judge panel on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against the president’s son on a separate group of motions. Biden had sought to have the charges against him dismissed for several other reasons arguing he was the victim of selective and vindictive prosecution and that a pretrial diversion agreement he and prosecutors both signed last summer bars the government from charging him.

The federal judges ruled that Biden cannot make those arguments until after his trial is completed. Abbe Lowell his lead defense lawyer said in a statement that the team will appeal the panel’s decision."

On Friday the S&P 500 index crossed the 4400-mark for the first time while the Dow Jones Industrial Average moved past 35000 and reached a new high. Meanwhile weekly jobless claims increased unexpectedly to around 419000 dampening hopes of labor market recovery.

Continuing its buyout spree Accenture bought two technology companies early this week — Toronto-based Oracle cloud service provider Cloudworks and workforce optimization consultancy Workforce Insight – and completed the previously announced acquisition of France-based cybersecurity firm Openminded.

In another tech deal Microsoft agreed to acquire security start-up CloudKnox. Meanwhile Visa clinched a deal to buy Currencycloud for about 700 million pounds.

The airline industry dominated the earnings scene this week with United Airlines reporting results on Tuesday and Southwest Airlines and American Airlines releasing their second-quarter statements on Thursday. Earlier IBM came out with positive numbers for its most recent quarter on Monday. The next day all eyes were on streaming giant Netflix which published mixed results in the after-hours.

Energy firm Kinder Morgan Seagate Technology Verizon soft drink major Coca-Cola and Johnson & Johnson stole the show on Wednesday. Thursday was as busy as usual with the major events being the second-quarter earnings releases of telecom firm AT&T fast-food chain Domino’s Pizza Biogen Abbott Laboratories Intel as well as social networking platforms Twitter and Snap. Schlumberger American Express and Kimberly-Clark reported Friday before the opening bell.

While Lockheed Martin is probably the only major company to report earnings on July 26 the market will be closely following the report of Alphabet on July 27. The Google parent will be joined by gadget giant Apple chipmaker AMD Starbucks and Microsoft in the after-hours. Before the opening bell aviation firm JetBlue and engineering behemoth General Electric are scheduled to report earnings.

The financial releases of Bristol-Myers Squibb aircraft builder Boeing and Ford Motor are the key events slated for July 28. The next day is going to be as hectic when the earnings announcements of e-commerce giant Amazon.com Altria Group Yum! Brands and Merck & Co. are on tap. Procter & Gamble oil giant ExxonMobil and Caterpillar are among the major companies preparing to report on July 30.

Yes here's why…,"This rendering of what Bedrock Real Estate intends to with the south concourse of Tower City Center’s The Avenue shopping mall in downtown Cleveland including a partnership with Chain Reaction to award three entrepreneurs 18 months of free rent at Tower City stores (Bedrock).

CLICK IMAGES TO ENLARGE THEM

Ten days ago news broke that Bedrock Real Estate would aggressively market its Tower City Center complex so it could exchange its cobwebs and echoes for business tenants and retail customers. NEOtrans opted to not respond to this press release.

Why? Because I was skeptical about how serious Bedrock was. Understandably shopping malls across the country were dying with some getting replaced by Amazon distribution centers. NEOtrans broke the news about several of them locally starting with the first one at Euclid Square Mall. And all of those mall deaths occurred before the pandemic got other malls sick too.

Bedrock has contributed to the loss of tenants at Tower City as much as the growth of e-commerce and the decline of downtown’s office workforce. But while downtown’s workforce dipped its residential population shot up and held strong through the pandemic. Residents are a more lucrative market for retail than workers who tend to make larger purchases nearer to where they live a recent study showed. But that study also said downtown niche retail can draw customers from far away.

Furthermore Bedrock has now owned the former Cleveland Union Terminal railroad station-turned-Tower City Center for five years and not been able to reactivate its 366000 square feet of retail and public spaces. The opposite has happened. It has entertained previous ideas and none of them panned out including CityBlock (NEOtrans broke the story on that one too). So why are they are suddenly serious about redeveloping the downtown mall into of all things a mall? I had my doubts.

That was until this past week when two events happened.

In 1989 Tower City Center was in the midst of its conversion from the Cleveland Union Terminal railroad station to a retail center office and hotel complex. But as more shopping and lifestyle centers like Crocker Park Legacy Village and Pinecrest opened in the suburbs fewer shoppers came downtown and Tower City (Cleveland Magazine).

The first event was a note I received from a Bedrock source. “I’m surprised that you haven’t commented on our plans for Tower City on your blog” the source wrote.

I expressed my skepticism and asked why I shouldn’t be skeptical.

“You can probably assume what you like from my having reached out to you” the source wrote. “Wish I could be more forthcoming. Keep up the good work. I know a lot of us have appreciated your blog. You seemed to know things about SW (Sherwin-Williams’ headquarters site search) before we did or before they did for that matter.”

The other event came two days ago from two Tower City tenants reporting to NEOtrans that they were contacted by Bedrock’s local staff. The inquiries went something like this: “We’d like to know what your intentions are about remaining at Tower City Center.” One was asked if it would be willing to make improvements to their retail space.

Those tenants are in a part of the mall that was unaffected by June’s flood. A sprinkler above The Avenue mall at Tower City broke and flooded the mall near the Public Square entrance. Bedrock began securing city permits this week to make significant repairs to the flood damage according to Building & Housing Department records.

An ill-fated redevelopment scheme for Tower City Center was Bernie Moreno’s CityBlock which would have turned the mall into an incubator for technology start-ups and other types of new businesses (Vocon).

If Bedrock is going to be courting retailers who might they be? Let’s consider the market which involves both timing and population. And let’s look at what is called “comps” in the real estate business or comparables.

A real estate source who does a lot of work in site selections locally was contacted by NEOtrans for his input. He said Bedrock’s initiative is mostly about the upcoming National Basketball Association’s (NBA) All Star Game to be held Feb. 20 2022 in Cleveland.

To a lesser extent the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and Museum’s induction ceremony on Oct. 30 will play a role. Both events will be held at the Rocket Mortgage Fieldhouse which is connected to Tower City by an underground walkway. Some pop-up retailers may be added by October but it will take longer for other retailers to come on board. That’s why the NBA All Star Game is a bigger deal the real estate source said.

Look for Bedrock to bring in athletic retailers like Nike Under Armour and Moosejaw plus streetwear shops along the lines of RSVP Gallery or Bodega. Bedrock founder and Cleveland Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert wants to put his best foot forward at the All Star Game. NBA stars start businesses. Others provide capital to them. And some are free agents looking for a new team and a new home with cool stores to flash the cash.

Mainstream retailers line downtown Detroit’s main street of Woodward Avenue thanks to Bedrock giving them low or no rent for an introductory period of time (Google).

For comps look no further than what Bedrock did to draw businesses to their properties along Woodward Avenue Detroit’s version of Euclid Avenue. They gave free or reduced rent to retailers that would draw business to benefit other nearby retailers. Finding the right mix of retailers is the key to any successful shopping area.

Along Woodward you’ll find all of the above-mentioned athletic retailers plus Bonobos H&M Warby Parker lululemon Le Labo Shinola Madewell American Cycle & Fitness UPS Store FedEx Office plus wine stores day spas drug stores bank branches and lots of restaurants and clubs.

Those businesses alone would certainly reactivate Tower City. But what’s equally intriguing is Bedrock’s stated desire to work with Chain Reaction a Cleveland-based economic development project business bootcamp and competition that helps groom the next generation of local entrepreneurs.

Chain Reaction is produced by Cleveland Neighborhood Progress the Greater Cleveland Partnership’s Council of Smaller Enterprises JumpStart and Cleveland Development Advisors. As a sponsor Bedrock says it will provide mentorship to participants throughout the program’s duration as well as prizes for the top three entrepreneurial finalists of their competition combined for 18 months of brick-and-mortar tenancy at Tower City Center.

A conceptual rendering of what Tower City Center’s Riverview phase between Huron Road and the Cuyahoga River could look like featuring greenspaces riverfront promenade plus office hotel and residential buildings (Vocon).

And as NEOtrans reported earlier this year look for Bedrock to develop the Riverview phase of Tower City in the coming months and years. It has considered developing this site for some time including for Sherwin-Williams HQ as alluded to earlier.

Now Gilbert has one of his own locally growing corporate office end-users that will be looking for a new building soon — Rocket Mortgage. Add to that a possible hotel and more apartments either in a new building and/or in Sherwin-Williams old HQ in the Tower City complex. They will need Tower City stores and other businesses to patronize.

Will Bedrock be able to attract the chain retailers even by offering free rent as pop-up retailers over the coming months? Will they stay after the pop-up period expires and they have to pay rent? And how will Tower City’s existing retailers who have stuck it out through some pretty dark times react to newcomers getting a free ride?

It will depend on how much new foot traffic the pop-up retailers attract to Tower City and the existing shops. There’s a lot for Bedrock Tower City and downtown retail in general to prove here. I no longer doubt Bedrock’s sincerity to try something here. But there are still a lot of questions that have yet to be answered. And they will be given time.

""That was our teenage years. Our entire lives focused around that mall"" Deirdre Wingell of Worcester said. ""You would go to the music store downstairs where your friends worked and you would buy music and videos and there was places to eat.""

Construction teams are expected to make work of demolishing the vacant mall in the coming months with demolition on schedule to finish by October. Crews have begun tearing up the mall's parking lot and setting up for work further down the line. The mall's structure remains intact as of Friday.

A spokesperson for Boston real estate developer and management company Finard Properties the owner of the mall property said the project is on schedule and systemic demolition of the building will commence over the coming months.

Redevelopment as Amazon facility

The site is now planned for redevelopment as a 121212-square-foot warehouse and distribution center for Amazon. The Amazon facility is projected to open by fall 2022.

The mall opened in 1987. Lenders foreclosed on the property in 2016 which was then owned by Simon Property Group of Indianapolis. Finard purchased the 22-acre mall property for $7.1 million in 2019. The developer initially planned to build a mixed housing and retail area on the property before saying the COVID-19 pandemic fundamentally changed capital markets.

Working at Lechmere other stores in mall

Wingell worked at the mall's Lechmere location in high school and her early college years. She began as a cashier before moving to the music and video rental department.

""All the high school kids had jobs. We could all work there"" Wingell said. ""It was just a fun place after school. They allowed you to be social. They still expected you to work but you knew people from the different areas.""

Wingell was the only girl in her work group and she compared her co-workers to ""four big brothers."" She recalled one time when her co-workers left her a can of soup while she was sick with mononucleosis.

On days when Wingell had to close the store she remembered times when music videos would be played as the staff did its final cleanup.

A moment that stuck with Wingell from her time as an employee was when a customer approached her in the music department and asked her for an audiotape with a fairly short duration that was not out on the counter. Having seen the specific tapes being stocked earlier Wingell said she found one in the back of the store for the customer.

After the purchase the customer left Wingell a very kind compliment and a silver pin with some significance to him. Wingell said she still has the pin to this day.

""I now make sure that if someone does a good job like that I make sure that I pass that on"" Wingell said. ""I make sure that their supervisors know.""

Councilor Mero-Carlson: Mall brought stores closer to North Worcester residents

Worcester City Councilor Candy Mero-Carlson whose district includes the Greendale Mall said the mall was convenient and had a large parking space. The mall brought several stores closer to North Worcester residents Mero-Carlson said.

""It was easy access I guess I would say"" Mero-Carlson said. ""At the time when it was built it had all of the unique stores that other malls had that we hadn't had here in Worcester. It was the place to go.""

Mero-Carlson said the mall's Designer Shoe Warehouse was a hit with residents and was the store that she often spent most of her time in.

Other stores that once had spots at the mall include Miltons Filene's Basement London Fog Nine West Outlet Jones New York Barneys New York Outlet Marshalls TJ Maxx and Benetton.

Mero-Carlson would often go to the Greendale Mall with her mother.

""We would go there and she always liked to go into Marshalls where I would be the one who wanted to go into DSW"" Mero-Carlson said. ""For me those are really special moments having the opportunity to go there with my mom.""

Mero-Carlson said the loss of the mall required Worcester residents to drive to the outskirts of the area to find large retail spaces.

""Everybody was driven to the outskirts. Whether it was to go to the Auburn Mall or the Solomon Pond Mall once that was built"" Mero-Carlson said. ""I do think that it was not a good day for us in Worcester to lose a big retail space where people could go shopping.""

Mero-Carlson said customers could at least still go to the Worcester TJ Maxx location at Lincoln Plaza.

While Mero-Carlson said she wished the initial mixed-use plan for the property had come to fruition she said she is hopeful for Amazon bringing jobs to Worcester and for the large corporation to be a good neighbor by working with the city and giving back to the nearby area.

The company which donated $100000 to United Way of Central Massachusetts for summer swim lessons has begun talking with the city Mero-Carlson said.

Burncoat Street resident: 'It always seemed a little out of place'

Bill O'Connor a Burncoat Street resident for 50 years will not miss the mall. He said he never felt like the mall fit in with the surrounding area and the design of the road around the mall was difficult to maneuver.

""It always seemed a little out of place. Getting out of the mall was always a chore because you couldn't get right onto West Boylston Street"" O'Connor said.

O'Connor welcomes something new coming to the spot on Neponset Street.

""Anything's better than leaving it just sitting there"" O'Connor said. ""I'm not opposed to an Amazon whatever they want to put there if they can figure out the traffic pattern.""

Former business owner in mall: Many vendors struggled during mall's final years

Sam Abdel-Hadi owner of Sam's Furniture & Liquidation Outlet in Leominster operated a shop called Greendale Furniture at the mall for six years before leaving in 2019.

Abdel-Hadi said he moved his store when he received word from the mall's owners that the property's use might eventually change.

In his six years as a vendor at the mall Abdel-Hadi said that the mall was in a downturn. While the mall's owners were kind and responsive Abdel-Hadi said many of the vendors struggled during the mall's final years.

""The residents didn't come so often to this mall especially after they closed Old Navy. They closed Marshalls a long time ago"" Abdel-Hadi said. ""That slowed down the business and the traffic inside the mall. I used to tell the security guards over there it would look nice during the business hours as a shooting range. Because there's no one over here.""

Abdel-Hadi said the word-of-mouth advertising his store helped it to attract a group of regular customers from around the New England region possibly more from outside the Worcester area than from Worcester many of whom he was able to bring with him when he moved to Leominster.

Indian Lake neighborhood resident laments loss of mall restaurants

Deb Van Batenburg a longtime resident of the nearby Indian Lake neighborhood said she considered the lights at the top of the mall to be a reminder that she was almost home while she was driving.

""When I came down the exit ramp. I always really liked that I knew I was almost home when I saw the white light on top of the mall and a row of windows"" Van Batenburg said. ""At that time when I moved here 34 years ago it was thriving and it was nice to have it here. Even through the demise of the mall there were two restaurants in that mall on the lower level that were very small Worcester businesses — the Chinese restaurant and the Hispanic restaurant. Both of which in this neighborhood you could run down there and grab yourself an affordable meal in five minutes.""

The displacement of those two restaurants is something that Van Batenburg laments about the closing of the mall.

Indian Lake Community Association critical of Amazon

Van Batenburg is vice president of the Indian Lake Community Association a group devoted to improving and beautifying the neighborhood. The group has also been critical of Amazon's outreach to the Indian Lake community and about potential downsides to Amazon entering Worcester.

""This whole organization is a vision of a family-friendly great neighborhood. Come to this neighborhood: it's diverse it's interesting it has things that other parts of the city don't have. And now we have a warehouse and a bunch of trucks running up and down our neighborhood"" Van Batenburg said. ""It's compromised a lot of what we want as our vision.""

Christopher Peña Indian Lake Community Association board member said he watched the mall deteriorate over time and did not have much interest in going to the mall during its downturn. He instead looks to activities by the city's bodies of water as key nostalgic moments.

""As a resident who has lived here I've been watching that mall go to decay"" Peña said. ""I wasn't really feeling inspired by going there and engaging. The true nostalgia comes back to our lifestyle around water. That's something that probably all have experiences with. Whether that's at a beach by a river or a creek a lake a pond. That's something that we can remember: going on the water learning our first time to swim learning how to canoe learning how to kayak or sail. The nostalgia of the community comes with the re-envisioning and the empowerment of the community to know that we can design a living ecosystem that fits our lifestyle.""

Peña said he is a little disturbed when seeing the preparations for the demolition of the mall adding that the mall once housed several local businesses and will now be used to service people who do not live nearby.

Simon Tricklebank and Brendon Connolly of TSR Electrical and Ian Parker of John Truslove.

GROWING demand for its work on high-end housing projects has seen contractor TSR Electrical looking for new recruits after a move to bigger premises aided by property agents John Truslove.

Company founder Simon Tricklebank is also expanding the design and installation services TSR can offer its clients moving into the field of home automation systems.

But this meant the firm needed bigger new premises.

A conversation with Ian Parker joint managing director at John Truslove gave the firm the opportunity to view a number of potential new homes.





Simon said: “Ian is great to work with and very friendly.

“We needed somewhere that was split 50-50 with offices for our growing technical and design side alongside our team of installers.

“When Ian showed us around the property at Washford in Redditch it was clear it would be ideal for our purposes.

“We were under time pressure as the lease on our previous premises was ending but Ian Ruth Banting and the team at John Truslove worked really hard for us so we could move in as quickly as possible.”

Ian Parker secured a five year lease for his landlord client with TSR Electrical for the 1666 sq ft Unit 77 on Heming Road.

Ian added: “TSR Electrical had very specific needs but we specialise in helping growing firms find new premises to take the next step securing excellent new tenants for our landlord clients.

“Despite the time pressures involved in this case we were able to secure a deal that works for both parties. It also means another ambitious growing business has chosen Redditch as its home.”",,,,,,,,,

Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck’s rekindled romance has single-handedly got most of us through the last few months and the lovebirds have finally made it Instagram official.

The singer 51 gave the people what they were asking for this weekend and shared a cute snap of her and Ben 48 sharing a kiss to her Instagram account.lopez

The couple who were engaged between 2002 and 2004 but cancelled their planned wedding in 2003 and splitting just months later got back together this year following Jennifer’s split from Alex Rodriguez 45.

It’s the first time Ben and Jennifer have confirmed their romance on their own social media accounts with Jen simply captioning the snaps: ‘5 2 … what it do …’

The pair have however been photographed kissing multiple times in recent weeks even heading on holiday to The Hamptons.

They were also pictured cuddling in a photo shared to pal Leah Remini’s account the day before sharing their kissing picture posing in a photo booth alongside Leah.

Their rekindled romance is said to be getting so serious that reports suggest they are planning to move in together ‘very soon’ and both want to be ‘involved’ in each other’s children’s lives.

A source told Us Weekly: ‘Ben and Jen are spending almost every night together when they’re not working. They plan on moving in together very soon.’

They added: ‘They’re fully committed to taking the next steps and spending the rest of their lives together… As far as they’re both concerned they’re just blessed to have found each other and discovered true love which most people can only ever dream about.’

Jen recently swerved questions about her new/old romance with Ben after Today’s Hoda Kotb asked: ‘You look happier. Look I just have to tell you every time I see a picture of you and Ben I’m like “She looks happier she looks happier”. Are we happier?’

Jennifer replied: ‘I’m always happy when I see you Hoda’ to which Hoda pressed: ‘Wait it’s me you’re talking to you know that.’

‘I know’ Jennifer replied adding: ‘You can call me. You have my number.’

ED AND COURTENEY BFFS

The Friends star and Shape of You singer Ed Sheeran have become firm if rather unlikely pals.

Unlikely because one lives a Hollywood life in a Los Angeles mansion and the other ferociously guards his privacy at his sprawling country estate in Framlington Suffolk where he grew up.

And there’s a 26-year age difference.

Ed 30 recently teamed up with Courteney 56 and Elton John to sing a spoof version of Elton’s Tiny Dancer.

The video starts with Ed dedicating the song to Friends star Lisa Kudrow whose character Phoebe once mistakenly thought the lyrics to the 1971 hit were ‘Hold me closer Tony Danza.’

Grammy winner Brandi Carlile joins in on guitar while Courteney plays piano. At the end they give a shout-out for actor Danza and Courteney gives Elton a hug.

Courteney called it “one of the greatest moments” of her life.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZW5ld3MuY29tLnBrL2xhdGVzdC84Njc5NTMtcGljdHVyZS1oYWxzZXktc2hhcmVzLWFkb3JhYmxlLW5ldy1zbmFwLW9mLXdlZWstb2xkLXNvbi1lbmRlctIBY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZW5ld3MuY29tLnBrL2FtcC84Njc5NTMtcGljdHVyZS1oYWxzZXktc2hhcmVzLWFkb3JhYmxlLW5ldy1zbmFwLW9mLXdlZWstb2xkLXNvbi1lbmRlcg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Picture: Halsey shares adorable new snap of week-old son Ender,"Picture: Halsey shares adorable new snap of week-old son Ender Halsey shares first ever snap of week-old son Ender

Stephanie Wickstrom who was married to lineman Eric Wickstrom of Redlands brought the complaint Thursday in Los Angeles Superior Court on behalf of herself and her twin sons against the Rosemead-based company seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages.

“SCE understood and knew that due to its flawed and dangerous safety culture unsafe acts will occur and accidents and serious injuries will happen when third-party contractors were working on its facilities” the suit states. “There had been a number of injuries and/or deaths caused by SCE’s flawed safety culture including at least three injuries in 2018 and one death in 2018.”

An SCE representative could not be immediately reached.

In 2020 SCE had a contract with Wickstrom’s employer Diversified Utility Services Inc. to maintain and repair distribution lines the suit states. Wickstrom and other Diversified workers assisted SCE’s repair crews by doing emergency repair work on poles damaged by vehicles the suit states.

SCE personnel oversaw and were in charge of the work done according to the suit.

On July 22 2020 Diversified sent a four-man crew including Wickstrom to repair a pole hit by a vehicle in San Bernardino the suit states. SCE instructed and assisted the Diversified crew by directly working on the damaged pole and providing the replacement pole according to the suit.

Wickstrom worked near an energized circuit which SCE knew created a dangerous and deadly condition the suit states.

The SCE supervisor and the other SCE personnel on scene put a loaded crossarm atop the buckets of both aerial lifts to be raised and installed on the new pole the suit states.

“It was SCE’s regular practice to assist encourage direct and participate with placing crossarms on top of buckets” the suit states. “One of the SCE employees at the scene said ‘That’s how we do it.”‘

While lifting the crossarm Wickstrom was pinned against the pole the suit states. Injured but still alive he was unable to operate the aerial lift controls located in his bucket according to the suit.

An SCE employee and/or a Diversified crew member assisted and attempted to use secondary controls to lower the bucket containing Wickstrom but the bucket ascended into energized power lines electrocuting Wickstrom the suit states.

Had SCE abided by its own policy it’s workers would have de-energized the circuit before Wickstrom’s work began and he would not have died the suit states. In addition the circuit on the pole was “dangerously outdated” the suit alleges.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vbW9kZXJuZmFybWVyLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA3L3JhbmNoZXItbWVhdC1jby1vcHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rancher Co-ops Offer Meat-Processing Solution For Small Farmers,"It’s processing day for San Juan Island farmer Lori-Ann David. For her livestock that means they’ll spend their morning as they typically would on the 100-acre Aurora Farms off the northern coast of Washington. And later that day their lives will end just steps away from where they were raised thanks to the mobile slaughter unit that comes to the farm about once a month.

For the people involved in making that happen—the farmers and employees of the producer-owned Island Grown Farmers Co-Op—it is less peaceful. Coordinating the logistics behind the process requires a certain amount of patience honed by island living. It involves moving a 32-foot goose-neck trailer containing the processing unit its two crew members and a USDA inspector required to ride in a separate vehicle onto a ferry (which isn’t always on time and can break down) from the mainland.

The unit then travels by road to David’s farm where it gets hooked up to water and power for the day. The unit which holds up to 50 carcasses depending on the size of the animal needs to be full for the co-op to operate efficiently. This means David who is one of only a few San Juan Island farmers with the capacity to host the truck coordinates with smaller farmers to bring their animals to the farm for processing.

“There’s a lot of phone calls a lot of texting [and] a lot of coordinating” says David who wouldn’t have it any other way. She says it fits her farming ethos of doing what’s best for the animals and the land which receives a nutrient-rich fertilizer from the offal or processing remains.

A lack of processing infrastructure has long plagued livestock farmers across the country stemming from a combination of issues that differ from region to region including consolidation a shortage of USDA inspectors and too large a financial and work-load burden for many small processors to take on. While Island Grown was the first in the country to start using a USDA-inspected mobile processing unit in 2002 a growing number of farmers are coming together to form these kinds of co-ops. Phil Shephard board president of Island Grown Farmer Co-Op estimates the number of mobile processing units now in use is in the thousands.

“The advantage is those animals live their lives [on the farm] and there’s no heat stroke from traveling for miles in a trailer to a processing facility” says Shephard who is also the owner of Blacktail Bass & Beef Farm on San Juan Island.

The processor boards the ferry once a week to one or two of the five islands that make up Puget Sound’s San Juan Islands and also travels across five mainland counties in the Skagit Valley. Once processed the meat travels to the co-op’s packing facility in Bow Washington.

This is all part of the dance that the 77-member co-op has done for almost 20 years. It began running the mobile processing unit to solve the problem of a lack of processing and market access for the island farmers. With funding from the Lopez Community Land Trust Island Grown was able to get up and running to meet the high demand for local humanely raised meats.

Even without the logistics of ferry crossing operating a farmer-owned co-operative is no easy task says Shephard. “Farmers are all independent-minded [and] we want to do our own thing” he says. “It’s a tricky business.”

Each member of the farmer-owned co-op sells their meat independently. But once the pandemic hit and restaurants closed many of the farmers suddenly had different customers which was when they decided to start marketing as a co-op. They are working on building a new 6000-foot facility that will include a retail shop.

The Bay Area Ranchers’ Cooperative (BAR-C) just had a ribbon cutting for its processing unit which is still waiting on a few pieces of equipment waylaid by COVID-19-related supply chain issues before it is operational which should be later this summer.

A lack of meat-processing facilities in California has been a problem for a long time says BAR-C board member Duskie Estes. But in late 2019 ranchers in northern California suddenly found themselves even worse off when the only USDA-inspected processing facility for miles around decided to stop processing meat unless it was sold under its brand and bought from the farmer at a rate they set. For the small farmers who had been using the facility as a processor and then selling to their own markets this wasn’t a viable option. The only other alternative was a 250-mile drive to the nearest facility in Eureka which stresses the livestock and takes farmers away from their farms.

The ranchers decided to take the problem into their own hands and in 2020 formed a co-operative which incorporated as BAR-C last July. After raising more than $1 million through investors for the project last November they purchased a mobile harvesting unit in a 36-foot drop-deck trailer with a 10-foot-high ceiling which arrived in June to the 38 members anxiously awaiting it.

While it is more financially feasible to park BAR-C’s unit instead of moving it from ranch to ranch it still means a significant reduction in travel time for its member ranchers most of whom farm about 10 to 20 miles away and a smaller carbon footprint. In a survey it conducted BAR-C estimated its 12 founding members have saved 19.6 tons of carbon reducing their total greenhouse gas emissions by 78 percent over an eight-month period.

In the Bay Area market buyers like Duskie Estes are eager to find sources for humane and locally raised meats. As a farm-to-table chef Estes trained all her cooks in head-to-tail butchering and watched the producers she worked with disappear over the last ten years.

Estes owner of Black Pig Meat Co. sources the meat for her slow-cooked bacon from Oregon because it is the nearest source of sustainable pasture-raised pigs with viable access to the USDA inspection needed for her to retail her product. But BAR-C’s processing facility could allow her to source more locally even from her own farm.

“Now it opens up a new business for me” says the celebrity chef. “I think we’ll see ranching grow here.”

Other livestock producer groups such as the Southern Wisconsin Meat Co-op have looked to BAR-C’s fundraising efforts as a model for their own. Southern Wisconsin Meat which incorporated this spring is working on purchasing a mobile processing unit. Unlike most other processing co-ops they are producer and butcher owned.

Southern Wisconsin Meat started as a 2017 grant-funded feasibility study which showed that 85 percent of the 80 regional producers surveyed could expand their production if they had access to more slaughter and meat-processing options.

All of the current and future members practice regenerative agriculture and the intent of the co-op is to continue that ethic in the nose-to-tail butchering of the animals. “We envision the meat co-op as the natural extension of the work done by the producer members” says Heidi Hoff a trained butcher who also raises Tunis/Gotland cross sheep and Alpine goats.

Hoff says that while the pandemic made the processing problem many small to medium-sized farmers face more visible to consumers it has been an issue in southern Wisconsin for at least five to 10 years a trend seen across the country.

The USDA has also taken note. It announced earlier this month an intention to invest $500 million in American Rescue Plan funds to expand meat and poultry processing capacity and increase competition accessibility and fairness according to a press release. Hoff is hopeful that this new funding could help groups such as Southern Wisconsin Meat but she says past funding has focused on processors already in operation rather than startups.

With or without government help the farmers in these types of co-ops are committed to them.

“This is done with so much concern and consciousness and heart not only for the animals but for the whole [supply chain]” says David. “We all take this very seriously—to grow food and get it to people in the cleanest way all around. We all know the alternative and it’s not good—we know we make a difference.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzA3LzI0L3NvdXRoZXJuLWVuZ2xhbmQtY2xvYmJlcmVkLWJ5LXN0b3Jtcy13aXRoLWxpZ2h0bmluZy1kZXN0cm95aW5nLWhvbWVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Southern England clobbered by storms with lightning destroying homes,"Floods and thunderstorms are slamming Southern England following a record heatwave according to reports.

The UK’s national weather service the Met Office issued a “yellow” warning across much of England and Wales. The agency warned that some communities might be cut off if roads flood. It also warned of power outages.

Farther north outside Manchester a fallen tree forced tram passengers to disembark and walk through the rain according to another report.

“We just had to walk. They didn’t tell us if the tram tracks were live; there was a thunderstorm and a tree was brought down onto the track and we were walking on the track” a passenger said. “How no one got injured is beyond me.”

The carrot recall occurred after the producer came to suspect the presence of Salmonella bacteria during an ""internal company test.""

Last Wednesday Grimmway Farms—a southern California company producing 65 carrot products that are available through retail and hospitality—announced they were recalling six of their carrot products after they reportedly detected Salmonella contamination.

The products recalled were Bunny Luv Organic Cut and Peeled Baby Carrots Bunny Luv Organic Premium Petite Carrots Cal-Organic Organic Petite Carrots Grimmway Farms Shredded Carrots O Organics Organic Peeled Baby-Cut Carrots and O Organics Organic Baby Rainbow Carrots. (Package sizes UPC codes and best-by dates for each recalled carrot product are indicated in the chart below published by the FDA.)

""The recall was initiated as a result of a routine internal company test"" Grimmway Farms President and CEO Jeff Huckaby stated. ""The health of our customers and the integrity of our products are our highest priorities and we will continue to monitor and communicate as additional information is available.""

They stated ""The products listed in the table below were shipped directly to retailers throughout the United States.""

Their press release adds that in addition to the recalled products listed on this chart ""the company recalled certain shredded carrots and chopped (chunk) carrots that were sold to food manufacturers and food service distributors. All affected food manufacturers food service distributors and retail customers have been notified with much of the product having been recaptured before being available for consumption.""

Grimmway Farms said they'd notified all customers who received the recalled carrots directly from the company and requested that they relay the information to their own customers.

For consumers the company said: ""Anyone who has the recalled product in their possession should not consume it and should destroy or discard it. Consumers with questions may contact our customer services desk at 1-800-301-3101 . . . or visit www.grimmway.com.""

A Bay Area family left a Southwest Airlines flight over a mask incident.

The family said they felt pressured to leave when their toddler could not keep his mask on.

They are vowing to never fly on Southwest Airlines again KRON4 reported.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

A California family said Southwest Airlines ""just wanted them off the plane"" when their 3-year-old son refused to keep his face mask on.

After the experience the family is vowing to never fly on the airline again.

Eric Hansen his wife and their toddler were all ready to fly from Las Vegas to San Jose on Friday 23 July KRON4 reported.

""They're a pretty big airline in the Bay Area but I am going to do all I can to not get another one of their flights and potentially go through another situation like this"" Hansen told KRON4.

Hansen said two flight attendants and a gate agent treated them like criminals. When they feared police were being called to arrest them they voluntarily stepped off the flight according to KRON4.

The family said they had to spend an extra night in Las Vegas without any of their checked baggage as a result.

""They should have given us more time maybe walked away and said we will give you five or 10 minutes but their flight was late so I think they were trying to make time. They just wanted us off the plane and they didn't give us any time to talk him through it and try to get him to put it on"" Hansen said.

Hansen complained to the airline which sent him an email apologizing for his experience on the flight. But it also stated that under the CDC's ""Federal mask mandate all customers (age 2 or over) are required to wear a mask. If the customer does not comply with crew member instructions we may refuse transportation.""

Southwest Airlines did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment

Hansen told KRON4 that the policy was inconsistent because his son was maskless on the inbound flight to Las Vegas and the rebooked Southwest flight back to San Jose the next day.

In a similar incident in April a family of three were booted off a Southwest Airlines flight after their 2-year-old could not keep his mask on.

In that case a passenger named Erik Harvey his wife Michelle and their toddler Jackson were all ready to fly from Denver to Austin on April 1 Fox News reported. However they were told to leave because Jackson was unmasked.

Though they grew to became the largest carrier of domestic passengers in the United States the early spirit does still come out. So it’s not surprising that a six year old wanted a Southwest Airlines-themed birthday party. The airline is certainly kid friendly (unless you’re a two year old with trouble wearing a mask).

Earlier this year a couple who met on board a Southwest flight got married in a ceremony officiated by a pastor who happened to be sitting in the middle seat between them at the time. They had an aviation-themed wedding with a Southwest photo booth. Also this year a Southwest pilot has his wedding on board a flight and all of the wedding guests simply bought tickets.

It turns out I was only 50 Rapid Rewards points short of booking a flight that would've cost upwards of $400 roundtrip in cash.

So close! Otherwise the trip was perfectly planned and I was about to cancel it over a flight I was only a few points away from being able to book for free.

I was just short of points on my award booking to Florida. (Screenshot courtesy of Southwest Airlines)

But I found a solution: Surveys. I signed up for Southwest's Rewards for Opinions and after taking two surveys I earned enough Rapid Rewards points to save my trip.

For more TPG news delivered each morning to your inbox sign up for our daily newsletter.

Southwest isn't the only airline that lets you do this: various other major airlines and hotel chains let you do these types of surveys so you likely can get points and miles for your preferred loyalty program through surveys.

Let's dive in and investigate more about surveys for points and miles.

Overview

Here's how surveys for points and miles work: companies ask your thoughts on various subjects and you get rewarded a fixed amount of points or miles after each survey.

Once you complete a survey your answers then get pooled with the answers of others and as a result businesses are able to see the general attitudes of people toward their products and policies.

Surveys for points and miles can be about anything: I have taken surveys on topics ranging from cars to electronics to delivery services. Each survey generally takes 10 to 30 minutes to complete which doesn't seem long — but this time can easily add up.

A few example surveys that I was offered to take for Alaska Mileage Plan miles. (Screenshot courtesy of The Opinion Terminal)

Here are some of the major airlines and hotel chains that offer surveys with the links to their respective survey websites:

Notably Delta Air Lines does not offer surveys for miles.

Many companies on this list also have partnerships with e-Rewards -- another survey site that allows you to transfer points and miles to various partners.

And chances are you likely have some points or miles for at least one of the airline or hotel programs above. Surveys could help you turn those points or miles into a reward booking. Although each survey takes some time to complete the time investment could be worth it in certain situations.

When are surveys for points and miles worth the time?

Here are three situations where surveys have proven to be especially helpful:

When you need a small sum of miles. I have personally found surveys quite useful when I am a few miles short of an award ticket such as in my earlier Southwest example.

Another example is when I was booking a United flight from Savannah Georgia (SAV) to Chicago O'Hare (ORD) earlier this year. The award ticket cost 5500 miles — but I only had about 5200 miles.

Taking surveys for miles helped me get enough miles to fly to Chicago. (Photo by Jacob Harrison/The Points Guy)

Again I was initially deflated that I was so close to an award ticket but couldn't book it — after all I'm a college student on a tight budget who would love to avoid spending money on a plane ticket. I don't own a United credit card and was not planning to earn miles before booking so there were seemingly no other ways to get the 300 miles I needed for the award.

But then I remembered that I could take a survey or two to reach my mileage goal so I signed up for Opinion Miles Club. It was my first time taking a survey for United miles so in addition to earning 50 miles for completing a survey I also earned a 300-mile sign-up bonus. This one survey alone with the sign-up bonus gave me enough miles to book the flight so I avoided having to pay for a revenue ticket.

When miles are about to expire. Each time miles from surveys are posted to your account they prevent your existing miles from expiring. This makes surveys a great non-credit card option to keep your existing points and miles — and to earn a few more too. Surveys are especially helpful if you have thousands of miles that you don't want to expire but don't have any near-term travel plans or the proper credit card.

Related: How to keep your points and miles from expiring

To take advantage of a sign-up bonus. Taking a survey to receive the sign-up bonus could be worth it especially if you're a few hundred points or miles away from an award booking.

Keep an eye out for promotions: Hilton recently offered 10000 HHonors points as a sign-up bonus for completing your first survey but this deal has since been dramatically lowered to 1250 HHonors points.

Sign-up bonuses for survey websites can be quite lucrative; I took advantage of the now-expired Guest Opinion Rewards offer that gave me 10000 HHonors points. (Screenshot courtesy of Hilton)

Here is a list of the current sign-up bonuses offered for various airline and hotel loyalty programs:

Should you spend your free time taking surveys for points and miles?

A common perception is that taking surveys for points and miles for long periods of time is not worth doing because of low mileage accrual after long surveys — but is this really the case?

To give that a closer look I took surveys for two hours with The Opinion Terminal — Alaska's survey partner — to see how many Mileage Plan miles I would receive. I chose the shortest surveys with the highest payouts to maximize my gains.

I ended up earning 391 Mileage Plan miles in the two hours of taking surveys — or 195.5 miles per hour. Based on TPG's latest valuations of the Mileage Plan program this is a mere $3.52 per hour worth of Alaska miles.

This was my first time doing a survey for Alaska so I also received a 400-mile sign-up bonus — worth about $7.20. However my total earnings including the sign-up bonus were still only 791 miles — or $14.24 worth of Mileage Plan miles — in the two hours of survey-taking.

Here are all of the Mileage Plan miles I earned in two hours. (Screenshot courtesy of The Opinion Terminal)

To get enough miles for the cheapest award ticket on Alaska which costs 5000 miles I would have to spend about another 17 hours doing surveys at the rate I was going — something I'm not willing to do.

As you can see it is likely not worth it to take these surveys for long periods of time. However if you enjoy taking surveys or are only a few hundred points or miles away from an award these surveys can be a great way for you to inch closer to your next award booking.

Things to consider when completing surveys for points and miles

Points and miles from surveys might not post instantly. Although I frequently receive points and miles almost immediately after finishing a survey the fine print says that it could take up to six weeks for miles to post.

For my Alaska Airlines example the miles were posted almost instantly to my Mileage Plan account after completing each survey; however when I took my first Hilton survey the HHonors points didn't post for a few weeks.

You will be bombarded with emails. I receive one to two emails per day from Opinion Miles Club alone offering me to take surveys; these frequent emails can be bothersome. And if you unsubscribe from the emails your account will be deactivated.

I unsubscribed from the Rewards for Opinions emails and inadvertently deactivated my account. (Screenshot Courtesy of Rewards for Opinions)

One workaround to the frequent emails is that you can automatically send the survey emails to a certain inbox that is separate from your main inbox. You could also give a secondary email when signing up on the survey website.

You might not qualify for every survey. When I was taking surveys for my Alaska Airlines example I was excited at an offer to take a 20-minute survey for 733 Mileage Plan miles — worth more than $13.

However as soon as I began the survey it abruptly ended. It turns out I was not eligible to complete the survey. As a result my 733 miles turned into a mere five miles — the sum given by The Opinion Terminal when you are deemed ineligible for a survey you already started.

So take note that you will not always qualify for every survey — and that can be a letdown when the mileage yield is high.

Bottom line

Although spending long periods of time taking these surveys is not always worth it they can be a great supplemental tool in earning enough miles for your next award trip — especially if you are only a few miles away from an award.

But with nearly 49% of the country fully vaccinated travel is making a big comeback — even with the fast-spreading delta variant.

If you're ready to travel The Points Guy (TPG) has released its annual report on the best U.S. airlines for 2021.

To determine the list the website ranked each airline in four categories using data from the Department of Transportation. Those factors include reliability (including timeliness cancellations and baggage); experience (cabin features lounges and customer complaints); cost (including bag and change fees) and loyalty (frequent flyer usage and award availability).

For the third straight year in a row TPG ranked Delta Air Lines No. 1 according to the report.

""The carrier wasn't a standout in any single category — it was fifth for mishandled baggage and fourth for customer complaints submitted to the DOT for example"" the report said. ""However Delta only hit the bottom spot in a single element (affordability) otherwise maintaining solid scores across the remaining data-backed criteria we analyzed. This consistency helped push it to the top spot.""

Here are the 10 best U.S. airlines according to TPG's report and their highest and lowest performing areas:

1. Delta Air Lines

Top-performing areas: involuntary bumps from flights lounges

Lowest-performing areas: affordability

2. Southwest Airlines

Top-performing areas: customer satisfaction bag/change fees award availability

Lowest-performing areas: lounges

(A Southwest spokesperson says it's honored to make the list during one of the toughest years in the airline's history and credits the Southwest employees for its success.)

3. United Airlines

Top-performing areas: route network frequent flyer

Lowest-performing areas: affordability

4. Alaska Airlines

Top-performing areas: lounges

Lowest-performing areas: bag/change fees

5. American Airlines

Top-performing areas: family route network

Lowest-performing areas: baggage

6. JetBlue Airways

Top-performing areas: cabin features award availability

Lowest-performing areas: bag change fees

7. Hawaiian Airlines

Top-performing areas: timeliness involuntary bumps

Lowest-performing areas: customer satisfaction route network

8. Spirit Airlines

Top-performing areas: cancellations affordability

Lowest-performing areas: wheelchairs scooters bag/change fees

(A spokesperson for Spirit says it's pleased to make the list and is ""looking forward to climbing higher in the years to come.""

9. Frontier

Lowest-performing areas: involuntary bumps bag/change fees award availability

10. Allegiant Airlines

Starbucks Japan releases a new Frappuccino every couple of weeks but they’ve really outdone themselves this summer by coming out with a whopping 47 new flavors at once! Why 47? Because that’s the number of prefectures in Japan and each new drink in the 47 Jimoto Frappuccino (jimoto meaning “local”) series is available exclusively in the prefecture it represents.

We’ve talked about a few of the region-specific flavors and even tried a couple for ourselves but we haven’t gone through the full lineup just yet. We’re fixing that problem today by looking at the complete list and at the same time we’ll be taking a look at their calorie counts. Not that that’ll stop us from drinking as many as we can of course just so that we can calculate how much time we want to spend in the gym to work off those delicious dessert drinks.

OK let’s get started starting at the lowest calorie Jimoto Frappuccino and working our way up (and by the way the number seen in each photo is simply the order in which the flavors were revealed not it’s calorie or deliciousness ranking).

47. Toyama Prefecture: Like a Whole Watermelon Frappuccino (211 calories)

46. Yamagata: We Love Ya Pears (294 calories)

45. Gunma: Yogurt Mango (295 calories)

44. Oita: Exciting Kabosu Citrus Tea (296 calories)

43. Saitama: Colorful Strawberry and Citrus (305 calories)

38. Fukushima: Colorful Fruits Bunch (343 calories)

37. Kagawa: Matcha with Wasanbon Fine-Grain Japanese Sugar (344 calories)

36. Miyazaki: Giant Shining Hyuganatsu Citrus (345 calories)

35. Tochigi: Lightning Tingle Chocolate (348 calories)

34. Nagasaki: Castella Coffee Cream (353 calories)

33. Kanagawa: Summer Blue Cream (364 calories)

32. Okayama: Awesome Fruit Sunshine (367 calories)

31. Nara: Hojicha White Chocolate (369 calories)

30. Shiga: Biwa Blue Citrus Cream (370 calories)

29. Chiba: Mitarashi Dango Dumpling Coffee Cream (372 calories)

28. Nagano: Smooth Butter Apple Caramel (373 calories)

27. Kumamoto: Crunchy Pie Biscuit and Chocolate (374 calories)

26. Tokushima: Juicy Sudachi Citrus (377 calories)

25. Kochi: Ginger Citrus (378 calories)

24. Tokyo: Olympic Coffee Jelly and Caramel (385 calories)

23. Hiroshima: Setouchi Lemon and Citrus (386 calories)

22. Fukuoka: Yamecha Green Tea (391 calories)

21. Gifu: Matcha Coffee Jelly (398 calories)

20. Yamanashi: Grape and White Chocolate Cream (403 calories)

18 (tie). Akita: Sweet and Salty Caramel (404 calories)

18 (tie). Okinawa: Chinsuko Cookie with Vanilla and Caramel (404 calories)

17. Kagoshima: Kuromitsu Cream (406 calories)

16. Mie: Isecha Green Tea and Citrus (407 calories)

15. Ishikawa: Stemmed Hojicha Tea (414 calories)

14. Kyoto: Matcha Kinako Roasted Soybean Powder (415 calories)

13. Osaka: Super Fruit Cream (419 calories)

12. Aomori: Apple Strawberry (423 calories)

10 (tie). Miyagi: Zunda Matcha (425 calories)

10 (tie). Fukui: Puffed Rice and Matcha (425 calories)

9. Niigata: Kakinotane Rice Crackers and Chocolate (430 calories)

8. Yamaguchi: Black Sesame (436 calories)

7. Shimane: Fortuitous Meeting of Creamy Matcha and Coffee (481 calories)

6. Tottori: Creamy Caramel (490 calories)

5. Hokkaido: Creamy Corn (499 calories)

4. Iwate: Matcha and Black Sesame (515 calories)

3. Aichi: Anko Sweet Red Bean and Coffee (547 calories)

2. Hyogo: Creamy Mature Chocolate Bar (600 calories)

1. Ibaraki: Creamy Melon (625 calories)

In the end it’s not chocolate but melon that packs the biggest calorie punch. At 625 calories Ibaraki’s Creamy Melon Jimoto Frappuccino has almost as many as a regular-size beef bowl at Yoshinoya which has 635. But hey Frappuccinos are essentially milkshakes with more ice so they’ve always been a bit of an indulgence and with this many delicious-sounding flavors we’re sure we can find room in our calorie budget for a few more before summer’s done.

What if the next time you order paintbrushes on Amazon you also invested in a mutual fund without even thinking about it or making any conscious efforts to do so?





And ultimately what if saving money became second nature to you so much so that you set aside a little every month to invest?





That was the goal Vikram Hirawat set out on in 2020 to achieve — helping people invest money every time they spent money to the point where it became a learned behaviour.

“When I started researching I realised that not a lot of people are in the habit of saving money. Investing was a totally different ball game..I wanted to build a platform that helps people save and invest whatever they could — even spare change that you usually don’t usually pay any heed to” he tells YourStory.

Roundups a micro-investing platform that invests users’ spare change every time they make a transaction was born in 2020 as a result of those efforts.





The app-only platform rounds up users’ expenditure to the nearest hundred and invests the spare change in a mutual fund which means if you bought a book off of Amazon for Rs 180 the app rounds it off to Rs 200 and invests the spare change i.e Rs 20.





Essentially every time people spend money on the Roundups app they also invest a little bit of it in an asset that yields returns and Vikram hopes this will bring about a change in the way people especially young adults think about money as “not just an instrument to buy things but also something that grows more money.”





Roundups launched 45 days ago has already seen 2000 organic downloads and around 10-15 daily transactions.





The startup’s founders -- Vikram Atishe Chordia the company’s CTO; and Babu Krishnamoorthy who’s also the startup’s investment advisor; are currently focussed on building a core team that can help scale the product as well as add more features.

Tiny drops of water make the mighty ocean

Saving and personal finance require a lot of behavioural change especially if they're not already learned skills people pick up in their childhood. Even when people do save money the Indian mentality is to tie it up either in fixed deposits or recurring deposits or leave it in a savings bank account where interest rates are not more than 3 percent.





""Financial apps that enable investing merely offer to help people by enabling them to invest in mutual funds and bonds that increase their returns. They’re meant for people who have financial discipline and set aside part of their incomes to put into an SIP or a mutual fund"" Vikram says.

Roundups’ aim is different — it hopes to change people’s behaviour when it comes to money which is especially important for young adults when they’re just starting out in their careers. The spare change-model cleverly circumvents any big deductions from people’s paychecks or bank balance so it doesn’t feel like you’re losing a whole lot to investment funds.

But slowly with enough spare change over a long period of time users can accrue a sizeable corpus and earn meaningful returns which Vikram hopes will help people see the advantage of investing.





Getting started on the app is easy — the usual KYC process that financial apps need and giving it the necessary permissions to access bank transaction information. The app auto-debits the spare change amount and puts it towards an investment fund.

Currently the app offers investment in only one mutual fund but will add more instruments soon Vikram says. It earns most of its money from the mutual fund issuer in the form of commission. Once it sees a little more traction Roundups hopes to launch a subscription model to charge for educational content around finance as well as investment advisory services.





The startup hopes to build a robo-advisor of sorts soon.





As for funding the startup says it has a good enough cash runway till December or January 2022 after which it will look for institutional investors. The company is incubated by doodleblue a digital strategy consulting firm where one of Roundups’ co-founders Atishe is the CEO.





Its competitors in India include ﻿Spenny﻿ which also works on a spare change model as well as DIY investing apps such as ﻿Zerodha﻿ ﻿Upstox﻿ ﻿Groww﻿ and ﻿Paytm Money﻿ among others that enable online investing.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNvdXRod2FsZXNhcmd1cy5jby51ay9uZXdzLzE5NDY2Njk2LnN0YXJidWNrcy1uZXdwb3J0LW1hZXNnbGFzLXRha2VzLXN0ZXAtZm9yd2FyZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Starbucks Newport Maesglas takes step forward,"Earlier this year the Argus reported that both Starbucks and Greggs would be opening at a retail development on Port Road next to the existing Maesglas Retail Park.

At the time it was reported that these retail offerings would be ready to open at the end of summer 2021.

Now it appears as though plans are moving forward – with a new planning application submitted to Newport City Council on behalf of Starbucks last week (Thursday July 22).

According to planning documents the American coffee chain has sought permission to install a large totem sign advertising the business along with illuminated menu boards and signage for the drive-thru aspect of the business.

If approved it will allow the unit to operate as a drive-thru in addition to a café/takeaway proving an extra option for customers.

It is not currently known when a decision is likely to be made by council planning officers.

Starbucks and Greggs development – what you need to know

In March 2021 it was revealed that specialist building company JW-G Construction has been appointed by Commercial Development Projects Ltd as the main contractor for a 27-week programme on a retail development site at Port Road off Docks Way Maesglas Newport.

The site is two miles to the east of Junction 25 of the M4 and 1.5 miles to the south of the city centre.

Though the nearby area is largely made up of warehouses it is also adjacent to the existing Maesglas Retail Park.

Indeed this latest planning application suggests that these new units may actually be considered an extension onto the existing park with the address for Starbucks listed as Unit 1 Port Road Maesglas Retail Park.

When news of the development was first announced JW-G Construction managing director John White said: “We are thrilled to be working on this project in collaboration with a trio of other Yorkshire firms.

""The project is a prime example of the type of business that can help an area further develop and grow with modern facilities in a prime location.”

The planning application can be viewed online here.

The long pole midfielder contributed 63 ground balls 16 goals and seven assists.

And it all has led to USA Lacrosse naming Jordan as its South Player of the Year.

More lacrosse:St. Andrew's boys take fifth state lacrosse title with 13-5 win over St. Edward's

Acknowledging the plethora of talent that can be found in the St. Andrew's lacrosse program the rising senior considers himself ""lucky"" to be the player who was selected.

""To be considered one of the top players in the south region is a great honor. This award means a lot because it helps me believe my hard work is paying off"" said Jordan a member of The Palm Beach Post All-County boys lacrosse team.

Jordan attributed the Player of the Year award to the way his teammates and coaches pushed him during practice.

""Sean Jordan is as nice a young man that you could ever meet and has the athletic ability to be recruited by every major D1 lacrosse program in the country and has the grades to go Ivy League"" said Tony Seaman St. Andrew's head coach.

Seaman continued saying the humble Jordan ""practices every day as if every practice was the championship game.""

And Jordan put the same work into the classroom as well making the decision to commit to Harvard University in his junior year.

Now Jordan is using his last year at St. Andrew's to show his future coaches that he's still improving. He also wants to reminisce on the success he's found with the Scots.

His favorite moment of last season?

The bus ride home from state calling it ""a peaceful time"" where Jordan reflected on the team's trials but realizing that ""every sprint rep and practice was all worth it"".

""We started out the year quite nervous"" Jordan said detailing a lackluster preseason tournament and the Scots' ""shaky"" first win against Oxbridge Academy.

Having realized the leadership lost from the graduation of the team's seniors he called the matchup a ""wake-up call. ... We had to find our own team's identity.""

And the team did just that thanks to the help of the coaching staff.

""During our playoff run Coach Seaman ran us to death"" Jordan noted. ""But for the first time no one seemed to complain. Everyone seemed to buy in.""

Then the team was there. At state. A goal that every lacrosse player talks about but few teams actually make.

""Against all odds of losing such talented seniors the year prior we had done it. For me it didn't hit until the bus ride home"" Jordan said of the team's 14-5 win over St. Edward's. ""When the game-ending whistle was blown I felt like we needed to win another game. I guess I had never thought I would win state like in the movies.""

But Seaman knows the perfect season and fifth state title couldn't have been accomplished without Jordan's athleticism and work ethic.

""Sean was the leader of a defense that gave up 3.9 goals a game over 16 games"" Seaman said. ""Sean was the best player on our team and we were a very good team.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vY2EubWlsZXNwbGl0LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy8zMDAzMDIvMjUtZ2lybHMtdGVhbXMtdG8td2F0Y2gtdGhpcy1mYWxsLXN0LWZyYW5jaXMtc2rSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,25 Girls Teams to Watch This Fall: St. Francis (SJ),"It's time to get fired up for cross country! Our traditional XC countdown is back although it will look a little different this time around - we just don't have as much quality data to approach it the way we have in the past. Instead we will look at 25 boys and girls teams that we think will have an impact this fall in their section in their division at the state meet or even nationally. Unlike past countdowns this year we're going to start with the clear contenders and then work toward some programs that might not be on your radar screen. As always if you catch an error or have updated information for us email editor Jeffrey Parenti (email at the bottom of every MileSplitCA page) and we'll make the corrections.













One of the few programs that seemed to at least try to get good value out of cross country this past semester St. Francis leads the state in the returning team 5K rankings. We've seen this coming for a while though: if you go back to 2019 and look at just freshmen and sophomores the Troubadours graded out 3rd in California for 5K and 4th for 3 miles. While they don't have eye-opening track results from the spring (more on that later) these returning rankings are more than enough indication of the deep talent pool that they have been developing for the past two years.

It all starts with rising senior Cate Joaquin who set a PR of 10:44 in the 3200 in March before shutting down for the year after only three total races. She is on the verge of stardom boasting PR's of 16:25.70 for 3 miles and 17:15.80 for 5K; she finished 4th in the D2 race at the 2019 state meet and also earned a trip to Foot Locker Nationals as a sophomore. That 3200 in the spring is a good indication that she was in great shape and hopefully her lack of racing was a deliberate choice for training purposes rather than forced by illness or injury. Assuming she is healthy she gives the Troubadours a potent #1 option up front.

Fellow Class of 2022 runners Tatiana Cornejo and Claire Silva provide strong support for Joaquin and also veteran leadership for the whole team. Cornejo has a 5K PR of 18:09 to go with a new best of 5:10 in the 1600 this spring and Silva seems to have closed the gap between them with her 5:17. St. Francis also boasts a strong rising sophomore class: Kayla Towne ran 5:10 and 2:18 in her first high school track season (indicating her potential to go well under 19 this fall) while Grace Dunham and Ryann Strawn both look like solid top 7 runners.

Depth is a concern for the Troubadours but in reality it's a concern for nearly everyone after the last 18 months through which we've collectively struggled. Given the traditional strength of this program however it's not difficult to imagine them filling in with solid varsity runners and returning to challenge for the D2 podium this fall.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdGxwci5vcmcvaGVhbHRoLXNjaWVuY2UtZW52aXJvbm1lbnQvMjAyMS0wNy0yNS9taXNzb3VyaS1oYXMtaHVuZHJlZHMtb2YtdGhvdXNhbmRzLW9mLWxlYWQtcGlwZXMtYW1vbmctdGhlLWhpZ2hlc3QtaW4tdGhlLXUtc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Missouri Has Hundreds Of Thousands Of Lead Pipes Among The Highest In The U.S.,"Missouri has some of the highest numbers of lead pipes in the U.S. according to a national report.

The Natural Resources Defense Council estimates there are at least 330000 lead pipes funneling tap water into Missouri homes and other buildings — the sixth-highest of any state in the nation.

The environmental advocacy nonprofit said the total is likely an underestimate given the challenges of surveying water systems and a lack of data. But a recent overhaul of federal regulations will force utilities to inventory lead water pipes nationwide in coming years shedding more light on a decades-old public health issue.

In Missouri and across the country drinking water is often flowing into homes through lead service lines said Erik D. Olson senior strategic director for health at NRDC. About the width of a garden hose these narrow pipes branch off the water main and are “basically lead straws going into your house” he said.

More durable and flexible than iron lead was often the material of choice for water pipes particularly in the early 1900s. Some cities like Chicago took it a step further and mandated the use of lead pipes in building codes.

Though the federal government banned lead pipes more than 30 years ago many water systems and utilities have yet to replace them.

Federal law requires water utilities cities and states to monitor water for lead and other contaminants. But because many lead service lines are on private property it can be difficult to control water quality at the tap — and homeowners are generally on the hook for the cost of replacing them.

“We often hear from water utilities “Well the water is safe when it's in our system’” Olson said. “What they mean is when it leaves the water treatment plant it doesn't have lead. But what happens is the lead is picked up in those narrower pipes that go from the water main in the street to your home.”

Lead is a powerful toxin with wide-ranging often insidious effects on human health. Even in small quantities it can cause heart and kidney disease fetal miscarriages and premature birth. In children lead exposure can permanently damage the brain and nervous system and lead to behavioral problems.

Many cities have adjusted their water pH or added special anti-corrosion chemicals to keep lead from leaching into the water. But changes in water chemistry or physical disturbances to pipes during construction can release lead in drinking water Olson said.

“As long as you have that lead pipe in the ground it's essentially a ticking time bomb; it's going to go off at some point” he said.

Tracking lead pipes state by state

For decades the Environmental Protection Agency has not required cities or states to track the number of lead service lines. Recently revised regulations will require all water systems nationwide to inventory lead pipes and share their data publicly — but not until 2024.

To estimate the current number of lead pipes in the U.S. NRDC requested estimates from all 50 states and the District of Columbia.

David Kovaluk / St. Louis Public Radio Many lead service lines are on private property making it difficult to test and control water quality at the tap.

Only ten states including Illinois provided statewide lead pipe estimates. Illinois had the highest number of lead pipes of any U.S. state with more than 679000. Another 782000 pipes of unknown material may be lead putting the potential statewide total in Illinois at 1.4 million.

Missouri officials did not share any data with NRDC.

In an email a representative from the Missouri Department of Natural Resources told NRDC that the department has “never collected [lead service line] data on a statewide basis” but it will begin receiving inventories from water systems in 2024 to remain in compliance with federal law.

The nonprofit relied on data from a 2016 water industry survey to estimate the number of lead pipes in Missouri which put the total at 330000 the sixth-highest in the U.S. On a per capita basis Missouri ranked fourth nationwide with 5362 lead lines per 100000 people.

There may be up to 12 million lead pipes in use nationwide the survey reported.

Daniel Giammar an environmental engineer at Washington University who studies water quality and was not involved in the study said the results are in the “same ballpark” as previous estimates.

Trying to catalog lead service lines can be very challenging Giammar added because many of these pipes were installed nearly a century ago.

“We’re talking about construction that was most likely done before 1940 or even 1930” he said. “Some places just weren’t keeping good records or nobody knows where they are.”

But that will change in the next several years as newly-revised federal regulations go into effect and water utilities are required to report information on lead service lines.

“Utilities are going to have to know where they have lead service lines and they’re going to have to have an easily searchable way for customers to look up the locations of these lines throughout their system” Giammar said. “That’s going to be huge. In three years we’re going to know so much more than we do right now.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpbmR5Y2l0eXRpbWVzLmNvbS9sZ2J0L1RoZS1BcnQtb2YtQmFua3N5LXRvLWRlYnV0LUF1Zy0xNC1hdC0zNjAtTi1TdGF0ZS1TdC83MDk4NS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'The Art of Banksy' to debut Aug. 14 at 360 N. State St.,"Banksy’s “Rude Copper.” Image courtesy of The Art of Banksy.

“The Art of Banksy”—the largest touring exhibition of authentic Banksy artworks in the world—will take place in Chicago on the fourth floor of 360 N. State St.: a 45000-square-foot space that was the home of other public exhibits a press release announced.

The public opening will be Saturday Aug. 14. The location is also home to the Museum of Broadcast Communications slated to reopen in August according to the Chicago Sun-Times.

This site is at least the third lined up for the exhibit. The exhibit was originally slated to open July 1 in a West Loop location. Those plans ultimately fell through and “Banksy” was moved to the Epiphany Center for the Arts 201 S. Ashland Ave. with an Aug. 7 opening date. Those plans fell through as well.

In true Banksy style “The Art of Banksy” is not authorized or curated in collaboration with the artist but rather sourced from private collections allowing the public to see works that would otherwise stay hidden in private homes or warehouses. Banksy whose identity is the art world’s biggest secret is a world-recognized activist. His graffiti-influenced stencil technique often combined with anti-establishment slogans is immediately recognizable.

Ticket prices start at $39.99 ($29.99 for children 16 or younger) with timed flexible and VIP ticket options available. Tickets are on sale for viewings from Aug. 14 through Oct. 31.

FORT INDIANTOWN GAP Pa. -- Spc. Jenifer Lilley recently completed training as a combat medic at age 44 and joined Headquarters and Headquarters Company 2nd Battalion 112th Infantry Regiment 56th Stryker Brigade Combat Team 28th Infantry Division Pennsylvania Army National Guard. Lilley originally from Pearl River Louisiana moved to Port Royal Pennsylvania 11 years ago and teaches eighth grade reading at Mifflin County Junior High.



Lilley who has several family members that have served in the military said “The reason why I was drawn to this was that I saw the camaraderie I saw the brotherhood I saw the discipline the loyalty.” She said she eventually wants to use her civilian teaching skills and experience to train other combat medics.



As her daughter graduated from college and her son graduated from high school Lilley was exploring enlistment options for her son and came across the Pennsylvania Army National Guard. Lilley said she believes her path to becoming a combat medic was influenced by her “servant’s heart” and desire to help people. Lilley’s situation during initial entry training was unique but her motivation allowed her to excel and graduate basic training with honors despite the age difference between her and her peers.



When asked why she joined the National Guard she said “I took an oath to defend the Constitution of the United States...I truly believe that I am serving this nation because I believe in what it was founded on and the American dream.” With the support of her family she was able to reach her goals she said.



“One of my big messages to everyone is that you need to live your life you need to seek out the things that bring you joy and happiness” Lilley said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

In this generation Intel adds more cores new instructions and more platform capabilities. In dual-socket servers this translates to an overall more capable server. Supermicro with its “Ultra” line which the SYS-120U-TNR is part of takes advantage of these new platform capabilities for a massive generational upgrade.

Supermicro SYS-120U-TNR Overview

As we have been doing recently we are going to split our review into the external overview followed by the internal overview section to aid in navigation around the platform.

Supermicro SYS-120U-TNR External Overview

The system itself is a 1U server that is 29.1″ or 739mm deep. This is slightly deeper than the Supermicro SYS-510P-WTR 1U 1P server we reviewed but one gains additional features.

Starting with the front of the system we get twelve 2.5″ hot-swap bays. The system itself can support NVMe SATA or SAS drives but one will need a few additional parts such as a SAS HBA/ RAID controller to allow the server to utilize SAS drives. These 2.5″ drive trays are not Supermicro’s legacy drive trays since they are thinner to allow for a full 12 drives in the 1U chassis. Even though they are different trays they retain the same tab color scheme as the previous generation and that is what we are showing above.

On the rear of the system we have a number of features. In the middle of the system we have a standard Supermicro “Ultra” I/O block including USB 3.0 serial VGA and an IPMI port. Like other Ultra servers and many competitive systems the onboard NIC is provided via a LOM in this case a riser which also makes it customizable.

The power supplies are 1.2kW 80Plus Titanium units. Supermicro was early adopting the 80Plus Titanium power supplies in its systems and the Ultra line tends to use these high-efficiency power supplies.

The far right (looking from the rear) I/O expansion slots are two PCIe Gen4 x16 full-height slots. Here is the riser powering those.

The middle slot is actually a change in this generation. While it is still a low-profile slot it is now a PCIe Gen4 x16 slot.

With the 64 PCIe Gen4 lanes per CPU Supermicro has enough PCIe expansion lanes to handle the shift to 12x PCIe Gen4 x4 links for the front drive panel (48 total) and 3x 16 lanes for these expansion slots (48 total) while still having more lanes left in the system.

While many may focus on how AMD EPYC can use 160x PCIe Gen4 lanes in a dual-socket system with current generation 2.5″ drives it is challenging to use that many lanes in a 1U system. We recently did a E1 and E3 EDSFF to Take Over from M.2 and 2.5 in SSDs piece where we showed how the next-generation EDSFF form factor will help allow for more PCIe devices in a system in the coming quarters. As of now the 128x PCIe lanes in a sub 800mm deep chassis is plentiful.

Next we are going to get to the internal overview where we will see what is inside and even how Supermicro is able to fit all of those expansion slots.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Hyderabad: American multinational investment bank financial services company Goldman Sachs is the newest Banking financial services and insurance (BFSI) player to set up operations in Hyderabad. It set up its Global Capabilities Centre (GCC) in Hyderabad in banking with a promise to recruit 2500 people by 2023.

Goldman Sachs is one of the many BFSI players that have made Hyderabad their second home. IT and ITEs apart Hyderabad is now in the reckoning for its strengths in banking financial services and insurance segment. The city already has 1.8 lakh professionals in the BFSI segment working.

“The policies of Telangana State to promote research and support the startups ecosystem access to trained manpower here and other factors swung the decision in favour of Hyderabad for our operations” Gunjan Samtani Head Goldman Sachs Services for India said.

IT Minister K T Rama Rao who launched the Goldman Sachs office in Hitec City earlier this week said the State was expecting entry of more players in the BFSI segment. “Goldman Sachs choosing Hyderabad tells about the city’s strengths. About 1.8 lakh people are already working this segment and that is a remarkable number” he said.

Hyderabad offers the best in class infrastructure progressive and friendly policies to accelerate the setup of these multinational companies. The city also has the greater eco-system of diversified businesses and diversified talent according to IT and Industries Principal Secretary Jayesh Ranjan.

Ecosystem players

Fortune 500 BFSI companies like HSBC Bank of America Wells Fargo JPMC Franklin Templeton Invesco Broadridge Berkadia Black Knight Financials Development Bank of Singapore Legato (Anthem Insurance) State Street Bank & Trust MassMutual Synchrony Financial (earlier GE Capital) have already set up their offices in Hyderabad.

In addition to the new entrants several major BFSI companies have expanded their presence significantly. These include Wells Fargo which leased 1.2 million sqft at the DivyaSree IT Park for an additional headcount of 10000. JP Morgan had leased one million sqft at the Salarpuria Sattva Knowledge Park. Synchrony BoA Broadridge ICICI and many others have expanded significantly in Hyderabad.

BFSI in Hyderabad is spread across domain like retail commercial wealth investment custodial services global markets securities fintech insurance e-commerce and digital payments among others Amarnath Reddy Atmakuri Chief Relations Officer ITE&C Dept (Government of Telangana) told Telangana Today.

Major global delivery companies like Infosys Tech Mahindra TCS Wipro have over 30 per cent workforce working to deliver services to the BFSI clients globally.

Insurance Regulatory Development Authority of India (IRDA) and Institute for Development and Research and Banking (IDRBT) two of the premier Central government institutes in the BFSI sector are headquartered in Hyderabad.

The city is also home to National Payments Corporation of India that has the largest data centre. With R&D support from IDRBT and NPCI Hyderabad is also seeing a lot of fintech startups and new digital payment innovations the official said.

Here’s who could need one when they are.,"The Biden administration now believes that fully vaccinated people who are older or immunocompromised may need a booster shot.

Though all three vaccines authorized for use in the United States — Pfizer/BioNTech Moderna and Johnson & Johnson — are highly effective in preventing Covid-19 infections recent data suggests that the efficacy of Pfizer’s two-dose vaccine can wane slightly four to six months after vaccination according to the New York Times.

However a booster shot could lift antibody levels even more substantially than the current two-dose regimen for the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines and could be especially beneficial for people 65 and older and those who are immunocompromised.

People who are immunocompromised may receive significantly less immune protection than the general population after two vaccine doses increasing the upside of a potential third shot.

According to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advisory committee which met earlier this week to discuss the potential need for booster shots about 2.7 percent of the US population is currently immunocompromised in some way whether due to ongoing medical treatment like chemotherapy their status as organ transplant recipients or another reason.

Immunocompromised people are also more likely to become severely ill from Covid-19 and they have a markedly higher chance of experiencing breakthrough infections despite being vaccinated — a concern magnified by a delta variant-fueled resurgence of Covid-19 cases in the US.

10. I am not clear if #ACIP & @CDCgov are legally able to recommend additional doses of #Covid vaccines while @US_FDA's EUAs stipulate the mRNA vaccines are 2-dose vaxes & J&J's is 1 dose. But CDC is making clear it isn't going to move on this till FDA alters the vaxes' status. pic.twitter.com/DMMIU0uKfZ — Helen Branswell (@HelenBranswell) July 22 2021

As things stand data from Pfizer indicates that its vaccine — the first to be authorized in the US and still the most common among US vaccine recipients — declines from 95 percent to 84 percent effectiveness against symptomatic infection after four to six months according to the Times’ Sharon LaFraniere.

Data from Israel where Covid cases are once again rising suggest that an even sharper decline in effectiveness against symptomatic infections is possible — but even then the vaccine remains “more than 90 percent effective in preventing severe disease” and the small sample size means there is still uncertainty about Israel’s findings.

“The goal of this vaccine is not to prevent mild or low moderate infectious disease” Dr. Paul Offit a member of the Food and Drug Administration’s outside advisory committee told the Times. “The goal is to prevent hospitalization to death. Right now this vaccine has held up to that.”

A booster shot administered at the six-month mark could increase antibody levels as much as tenfold according to data released earlier this year by both Pfizer and Moderna underscoring its potential value to older and immunocompromised people.

Israel is already offering a third Pfizer shot for immunocompromised residents — though millions of Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip have yet to be vaccinated — and Pfizer has previously suggested that a booster shot could be needed in the US.

Regulatory questions abound

Though the US currently has tens of millions of surplus Covid-19 vaccine doses on hand making a third Pfizer or Moderna shot available to millions of immunocompromised or elderly Americans likely won’t be a quick process.

Currently all three Covid-19 vaccines in use in the US are being administered under an emergency use authorization or EUA issued by the FDA which sets specific regimens for each vaccine: two doses several weeks apart for both Pfizer and Moderna and a single dose for Johnson & Johnson.

Changing that according to the Washington Post would require either full FDA approval for the vaccine or an amendment to the EUA. And until that happens the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices can’t go forward with recommending a third shot for vulnerable populations in the US.

According to the New York Times “doctors would have vastly more leeway to prescribe a booster for their patients” once the vaccine is fully approved by the FDA.

However there are some potential workarounds to get third shots in arms more quickly. According to Dr. Amanda Cohn chief medical officer for the CDC’s immunization and respiratory diseases center the US is “actively looking into ways ... to potentially provide access earlier than any potential change in regulatory decisions” — including through “a study or through an investigational new drug format.”

As the Washington Post reported after the advisory board meeting earlier this week that strategy could open up access to a third shot under the FDA’s compassionate use program which “would require enrolling individuals in a clinical study where additional doses can be given.”

President Joe Biden also struck an encouraging tone on the prospects for the FDA’s full vaccine approval in coming months at a recent town hall in Cincinnati Ohio.

“They’re [the FDA] not promising me any specific date but my expectation talking to the group of scientists we put together... plus others in the field is that sometime maybe in the beginning of the school year at the end of August beginning September October they’ll get a final approval” Biden told CNN’s Don Lemon on Wednesday.

Full FDA approval requires a massive amount of data including at least six months of vaccine efficacy data and it usually takes about 10 months for the agency to review license applications and reach a decision.

“When we were reviewing applications back when they were on paper there was so much it would not fit on the freight elevator” Norman Baylor the former head of the FDA’s Office of Vaccines Research and Review told CNN. “That’s how big the application is.”

However the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine has already been granted a priority review which shortens the potential timeline to six months and multiple officials have said approval will likely come even sooner potentially clearing the way for booster shots for older and immunocompromised people.

Moderna is currently “in the process of completing our rolling submission” to the FDA according to a Moderna spokesperson and approval for the Moderna vaccine will almost certainly take longer. The company told CNN this week that it has no specific timeline in place yet.

Full FDA approval could also have a number of other benefits in addition to opening up the possibility of booster shots for vulnerable groups. As NBC’s Shannon Pettypiece explained on Tuesday “the official regulatory signoff would remove a significant legal and public relations barrier for businesses and government agencies that want to require vaccinations for their employees and customers” and could also boost vaccine confidence.

Thus far the US has largely held back from imposing vaccine mandates though other countries such as France have embraced them to positive effect.

Emmanuel Macron announced on Monday that a proof of vaccination (or a negative test) would very soon be needed to access public events restaurants cinemas stations & airports…

The delta variant is spreading fast

As the Biden administration consensus coalesces behind the need for a booster shot for vulnerable groups the delta variant of Covid-19 is gaining ground quickly in the US fueling a sharp rise in new cases.

On Saturday the US reported a rolling seven-day average of nearly 50000 cases per day — the highest level since early May according to CNN’s Ryan Struyk and almost 39000 more cases than the same seven-day average in late June.

The United States is now reporting 49386 new coronavirus cases per day the highest seven-day average since May 3 according to data from @CNN and Johns Hopkins University. — Ryan Struyk (@ryanstruyk) July 24 2021

Additionally at a Thursday White House briefing on the pandemic CDC director Dr. Rochelle Walensky warned that the delta variant “now represents more than 83 percent of the virus circulating in the United States.”

CDC director Rochelle Walensky said that the infectious Delta variant of COVID-19 which was first found in India now comprises more than 83% of new cases nationwide https://t.co/77YcbvhKMG pic.twitter.com/dXK699zl6J — Reuters (@Reuters) July 22 2021

“Compared to the virus we had circulating initially in the United States at the start of the pandemic the delta variant is more aggressive and much more transmissible than previously circulating strains” Walensky said. “It is one of the most infectious respiratory viruses we know of and that I have seen in my 20-year career.”

As Vox’s Umair Irfan explained in late June when delta accounted for just 20 percent of new Covid cases in the US the CDC has identified delta as one of five “variants of concern.” Not only does it spread far faster than the original strain of Covid but it’s better at evading vaccine protections and as Irfan reports there’s some evidence that it can cause “more severe outcomes from Covid-19 compared to the original versions of the virus.”

Despite those breakthrough cases however the delta surge is overwhelmingly proving to be “a pandemic of the unvaccinated” as Walensky put it earlier this month. In the US more than 99 percent of recent deaths and about 97 percent of recent hospitalizations from Covid-19 have been among unvaccinated individuals.

As a result this latest virus outbreak has been especially bad in parts of the US with low vaccine uptake such as rural Missouri.

As The Atlantic’s Ed Yong reported from Missouri earlier this month “ICUs are also filling with younger patients in their 20s 30s and 40s including many with no underlying health problems.”

According to Yong

Almost every COVID-19 patient in Springfield’s hospitals is unvaccinated and the dozen or so exceptions are all either elderly or immunocompromised people. The vaccines are working as intended but the number of people who have refused to get their shots is crushing morale. Vaccines were meant to be the end of the pandemic. If people don’t get them the actual end will look more like Springfield’s present: a succession of COVID-19 waves that will break unevenly across the country until everyone has either been vaccinated or infected.

A swath of southern states including Louisiana and Florida are currently reporting more cases per 100000 people than anywhere else in the US with Florida alone contributing more than one-fifth of all new cases in the US.

“Folks [are] supposed to have common sense” Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey a Republican said this week. “But it’s time to start blaming the unvaccinated folks not the regular folks. It’s the unvaccinated folks that are letting us down.”

Currently only 34 percent of Alabamans are fully vaccinated — the worst vaccination rate of the any state in the US along with Mississippi.

Getting vaccinated protects individuals — and the whole community

As of Saturday about 57 percent of the vaccine-eligible population in the US — more than 162 million people — have been fully vaccinated according to data from the CDC. Another 15 million or so more have received at least one dose of the vaccine.

That level of widespread vaccination is unequivocally good news but with US Covid cases on the rise and the delta variant running rampant it invariably also means some of the new Covid cases in the US are “breakthrough infections” — fully vaccinated people nonetheless testing positive for Covid-19.

As Vox’s Umair Irfan explains

The CDC definition of a breakthrough infection is a laboratory-confirmed infection more than 14 days after the final dose of a Covid-19 vaccine as it can take a while for the full protection of a vaccine to spool up. This definition includes everything from infections that produce no symptoms at all to cases that result in death. “People often think about ‘infection’ and ‘disease’ as being the same thing and that is not the case” said Brianne Barker a virologist at Drew University. It’s only when a virus starts causing symptoms that an infected person is said to have disease so not all SARS-CoV-2 infections cause Covid-19. But as we’ve seen throughout the pandemic people can carry and transmit the virus without falling ill themselves creating a major route for the spread of Covid-19. That’s why tracking breakthrough cases is so important.

The good news about breakthrough infections though is that if you’re vaccinated and get sick with Covid-19 you’re far less likely to get severely ill than you would without a vaccine. With a vaccine the chance of hospitalization and death are both reduced compared to unvaccinated individuals according to Dr. Anthony Fauci the United States’ top infectious disease expert.

“If you look at the number of deaths about 99.2 percent of them are unvaccinated. About 0.8 percent are vaccinated” Fauci told NBC’s Chuck Todd on Meet the Press earlier this month. “No vaccine is perfect. But when you talk about the avoidability of hospitalization and death ... it’s really sad and tragic that most all of these are avoidable and preventable.”

Breakthrough infections shouldn't be taken to mean vaccines don’t work; but they SHOULD be taken as even more reason to get that shot in your arm. If everyone was vaccinated there would be far less reason for the virus to spread & fewer people for it to spread btwn. #velshi — Ali Velshi (@AliVelshi) July 24 2021

Currently the country is administering about 537000 doses per day on average down from more than a million per day on average at the start of July — and that dropoff could fuel a brutal self-reinforcing cycle.

Specifically according to Irfan “with vaccination rates slowing reports of people becoming infected after their immunizations could feed vaccine hesitancy which in turn can fuel more breakthrough cases.”

In reality however getting vaccinated actually heads off the risk of further breakthrough infections by making it harder for the virus to spread. And by the same token getting more people vaccinated will also go a long way toward protecting older and immunocompromised people who have already been vaccinated but may now need a booster shot.

“Each day hundreds of thousands of Americans are choosing to protect themselves their kids and their neighbors by getting their first shot” White House Covid czar Jeff Zients said this week. “These Americans are stepping up and doing their part. Each shot matters. Each additional person fully vaccinated is a step closer to putting this pandemic behind us.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vcXouY29tLzIwMzc2NjIvdGhlLXVzLWNhbnQtYmVhbS1pbnRlcm5ldC1pbnRvLWF1dGhvcml0YXJpYW4tc3RhdGVzLWxpa2UtY3ViYdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why the US can't just beam internet into authoritarian states like Cuba,"After an eruption of historic nationwide protests on July 11 the Cuban government is blocking its citizens’ access to major social media platforms to quash dissent. Now the US government says it’s looking for ways to beam uncensored internet access into Cuba.

On July 21 a State Department official confirmed that the Biden administration is “working with the private sector & Congress to identify ways to make the internet more accessible to the Cuban people.” A day earlier White House press secretary Jen Psaki told the South Florida local news station WPBF that restoring internet access in Cuba is a priority for president Joe Biden. “That isn’t easy” Psaki said. “But he’s going to look for ways working with his team to expand ways to do that or see what our options are.”

There are plenty of proposals from Cuban-American activists Florida politicians and members of the Federal Communications Commission for how the US might undermine Havana and connect Cubans to the web. The federal government could clear the regulatory hurdles that prevent Elon Musk from using his satellite network to beam broadband down from space. The government could muster decommissioned hot air balloons from Google’s Loon project to position floating cell towers in the stratosphere above Cuba. The US military could turn its naval base at Guantanamo Bay into a massive wifi hotspot.

Yet daunting technical roadblocks severely limit their potential to bring the free and open web to many Cubans.

For decades countries like the US ran programs like Radio Free Europe which broadcast news and entertainment to radio listeners living under the censorship of the Soviet Union. The US has run a similar program for Cuba under the name Radio Martí (named after Cuban independence hero José Martí) since 1985. The broadcasts—much like today’s proposals for a guerilla internet network in Cuba—aim to give citizens access to a broader range of information and empower them to challenge their rulers.

But the internet is not radio. It requires more advanced equipment and a stronger two-way connection between users and telecommunication networks. Transmitting web content isn’t as easy as firing off a pirate radio broadcast from a boat in international waters.

This helps illustrate why liberal democracies around the world won’t be able to just beam in uncensored internet every time an authoritarian regime cuts its citizens’ access to the web. If the US can’t pull it off in Cuba—a country 90 miles away which sits within range of some American telecommunications systems and hosts a major US military base—it’s hard to imagine any government or company doing the same in a harder-to-reach region like China’s Xinjiang province.

Google Loons deflated

Florida governor Ron DeSantis has been pushing the White House to consider using hot air balloons to connect Cuba to the web—and Biden has reportedly been considering DeSantis’s pitch. This plan borrows from Google’s now-defunct Loon project which for a decade used high-altitude weather balloons to float internet equipment into the stratosphere above areas with spotty web connections.

Loon successfully brought internet service to mountainous regions of Kenya and to Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria downed much of the country’s mobile network. But the balloons can’t provide internet service all by themselves—they can only extend the range of existing telecom networks into hard-to-reach areas. At some point they need to connect with terrestrial networks.

Cuba’s state-run ETECSA internet network obviously is unlikely to connect with the balloons. While American telecom networks in nearby South Florida could provide connectivity US mobile networks from companies like AT&T and Verizon aren’t compatible with the SIM cards in most Cubans’ phones which are configured for the ETECSA network.

Moreover the balloons need unfettered access to a range of radio frequencies to transmit web data down to people on the ground. The Cuban government could jam those radio signals to scramble any connections between its citizens and the balloons.

Could Starlink satellites send internet from space?

A second idea is to offer web access in Cuba from space using SpaceX’s satellite network Starlink. The satellites act as relays between people in remote locations and ground stations that are connected to the web via fiber optic cables. If you’re close enough to a web-connected ground station—and you have a satellite phone or a computer connected to a satellite dish—you could use Starlink to get online.

Fortunately much of Cuba’s landmass does appear to be within range of at least one Starlink station in Punta Gorda Florida. Unfortunately it’s exceedingly unlikely that many Cubans have a satellite phone or a Starlink satellite dish. The government tightly controls access to that sort of equipment and harshly punishes foreigners who attempt to smuggle it into the country.

There’s also a legal hurdle: Transmitting the internet into a country against the will of its government is a violation of international law. There’s not much the Cuban government could do to sanction SpaceX CEO Elon Musk if he ever did choose to start a pirate internet broadcast because he doesn’t do any business in Cuba. But in other countries like China authoritarian regimes have much more economic leverage over businessmen like Musk that might make them think twice before challenging the government’s internet censorship.

Guantanamo wifi hotspot

DeSantis also suggested that the US could take advantage of the territory it controls in Cuba—namely the US embassy in Havana and the military base at Guantanamo Bay—to create wifi hotspots. There are however some very sharp limitations on this idea. Wifi hotspots have a limited range that tops out around 50 yards so Cubans would have to physically cluster around the embassy or base to use the internet. Their physical presence as well as digital evidence that they’ve connected to the US wifi network would make it very easy for the government to figure out who is trying to evade censorship.

For now Cubans’ best hope of getting online is through the use of virtual private networks a key piece of technology that has allowed people living under repressive regimes all over the world to evade censorship online. Any heroics from the US at this point will mostly be performative.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vd2hhdC1pcy1odWF3ZWktbW9iaWxlLXNlcnZpY2VzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What Is Huawei Mobile Services?

When HMD revived Nokia in 2018 its debut lineup impressed us. Since then Nokia’s lower-end offerings have been solid choices for shoppers with tight budgets. Unfortunately the Nokia G10 ($149.99) fails to elicit the same level of enthusiasm as last year's similarly priced Nokia C5 Endi ($169.95). Though the G10 has incredible battery life a generous software upgrade policy and a lovely display for its price it's brought down by its lethargic processor meager storage and a body that feels cheaply made and breakable. If you absolutely cannot pay more than $150 the G10 will get you through the day but if you can scrape together another $20 the 2021 edition of the Motorola Moto G Play ($169.99) is a far better budget-phone buy.

Questionable Durability

The Nokia G10 is available in blue or purple and there's not much difference between the two; our test unit was purple but we found that in many lights it looked blue. At 6.5 by 3.0 by 0.4 inches (HWD) and 6.4 ounces it’s the perfect size to hold in one hand for an extended commute.

The phone’s backplate and chassis are plastic. The back has a textured matte finish that resists fingerprints and gives the phone a nice grippy texture. The plastic itself feels thin. Centered at the top of the backplate you’ll find a circular camera module. A prominent Nokia logo is etched in the center of the back panel.

The purple model of the Nokia G10 takes on a blue hue in bright light. (Photo: Steven Winkelman)

A headphone jack is on the top edge; a USB-C charging port and the speaker grille are on the bottom. On the left side there's a Google Assistant button and a dual SIM/microSD slot. A power button with an integrated fingerprint sensor makes its home on the right side along with a volume rocker. The hybrid fingerprint sensor is slow but accurate.

A 6.5-inch LCD with a teardrop notch for the camera dominates the front of the phone. Bezels are minimal save for the bottom edge where you’ll find a small Nokia logo. Despite the low 1600-by-720-pixel (269ppi pixel density) resolution the display is crisp. As with all the Nokia phones we’ve reviewed the displayed colors skew cool and the screen is not bright enough to use in direct sunlight.

A representative for Nokia told us the phone is splash resistant and has a strengthened-glass display. There’s a screen protector on the phone and a jelly case in the box but neither will do much to keep the screen from cracking if you drop the phone face-down on the pavement. However the plastic body should withstand minor drops without much damage.

Verizon Customers Need Not Apply

The Nokia G10 works on AT&T and T-Mobile's 4G (LTE) networks but not Verizon's. Overall band support is good but band 71 which is important for rural customers on T-Mobile’s network is missing.

We tested the phone on AT&T's LTE network in Chicago using a Cricket SIM and recorded average speeds of 6.4Mbps down and 4.1Mbps up. If you’re on a postpaid carrier you’ll likely notice better speeds since Cricket caps its customers’ speeds and prioritizes traffic for AT&T customers.

Call quality is good. Earpiece volume peaks at 84dB and is loud enough to enough to hear on a crowded train. Noise cancellation worked well on all our test calls.

Audio quality with the bottom-firing speaker is disappointing. The sound is brassy with mids pushed to the front and there’s noticeable distortion in the highs. With a peak volume of 88dB the speaker is loud enough to fill a room.

Dual-band Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 5.0 are supported. NFC is missing but it’s rare to see a $150 phone with that feature.

Sluggish Scrolling

The G10 is powered by a MediaTek Helio G25 mobile platform along with 3GB of RAM. There’s 32GB of storage with about 23GB available out of the box. You can add up to 512GB of external storage with a microSD card.

Even simple tasks are a struggle for the G10. There's noticeable lag when opening an app or scrolling through Twitter. The camera app is exceptionally slow taking several seconds to switch between the front and rear cameras. Although 3GB of RAM is the absolute minimum we’d recommend in 2021 a lack of RAM can't take all the blame for these issues; the Moto G Play performs much better with the same storage and RAM configuration.

Gaming was a complete loss. Genshin Impact crashed every time we tried to open it. Alto’s Odyssey worked but skipped frames and even a few app crashes punctuated our gameplay.

See How We Test PhonesSee How We Test Phones

On Geekbench 5 a synthetic benchmark that measures raw performance the G10 scored 143 single-core (SC) and 803 multi-core (MC). The Moto G Play scored a much more impressive 255 (SC) and 1269 (MC) on the same benchmark.

The power button has an integrated fingerprint sensor that's slow but accurate. (Photo: Steven Winkelman)

One bright spot is the G10's 5050mAh battery. Nokia claims it will get you through three days between charges; if you don't use your phone much that may be true. The G10 eked out 16 hours 8 minutes on our battery drain test in which we stream video over Wi-Fi at maximum brightness. That doesn’t quite live up to the Moto G Power’s 18 hours and 42 minutes but it's enough to let you skip a day between charges.

Selfies That Will Make You Shudder

Camera performance is another weak point for the G10. The rear stack packs a 13MP primary sensor a 2MP depth sensor and a 2MP macro lens.

In good light the G10’s primary sensor does a tolerable job. In our test shots in the default camera mode color accuracy and clarity were spot on. Depth of field was slightly shallow. When we switched to Wide-Angle mode we noticed some loss of clarity around the edges but the photos were fine for social media sharing.

The Nokia G10's cameras struggle in low light. (Photo: Steven Winkelman)

In low light things fall apart. Test photos were flat and muddy with extreme blooming. Foreground subjects were blurry and noise speckled out photos.

The macro lens is unsurprisingly poor. Our test photos were flat with significant fringing and blurring.

Selfie cameras typically do a good job with enough light but the G10’s 8MP sensor falls short. Our photos were crisp with excellent depth of field but there was noise around the edges. Our subject also appeared to have blemishes on their skin even though their complexion was smooth. Low-light test shots were a muddy mess with unnatural blurring in the foreground that can likely be attributed to over-aggressive noise cancellation.

A Simple OS Upgraded Often

A stock version of Android 11 ships on the G10. There’s no bloatware on the unlocked version and HMD doesn't even preinstall productivity apps. It’s rare and refreshing experience to use a budget phone without constant notifications popping up.

The bottom-firing speaker is loud but brassy. (Photo:Steven Winkelman)

The G10 is one of the few Android One phones sold in the US. That means you’ll get two years of prompt OS upgrades and an added year of security patches.

Missing the Mark

A year ago the Nokia G10's crisp display excellent battery life and multi-year OS upgrades would have been enough to excuse its sluggish processor paltry storage and mediocre build quality. But the budget phone market has changed a lot over the past 12 months and the G10 can’t keep pace with its competition. The Moto G Play comes in at just $20 more than the G10 and far surpasses it with superior build quality longer battery life and a more robust mobile chipset.

If you can spend a little more check out our Editors’ Choice winner for low-cost phones the Samsung Galaxy A32 5G ($279.99). It looks great it's more durable and it has a much more powerful chipset with good cameras and even 5G connectivity. With phones like the A32 5G on the market there's just no room for one that cuts as many corners as the G10.",,,

Atama Plus the Japanese startup offering AI-based learning materials for cram schools under the same name announced Wednesday that it has fundraised about 5 billion yen (about $46.4 million US) in a series B round. In addition to existing investors such as DCM Ventures and JAFCO Group participating investors include the Singapore Government-backed Temasek Holdings’ Pavilion Capital and US-based T. Rowe Price. This has brought the company’s funding sum to date up to about 8.2 billion yen (about $74.6 million).

The learning platform allows users to shorten the time to acquire basic academic skills. It can detect where students are likely to get stuck during learning so it can teach the teacher when they are likely to get stuck enabling precise and efficient coaching. It is being used in more than 2500 classrooms including Japanese notable cram school chains like the Sundai Group and the Z-kai Group as it is expected to have a high learning effect.

In July of last year the company began offering online mock exams and in December it launched a joint research group with Ritsumeikan University in Kyoto to link the company’s learning data to the university’s entrance exams. With the latest fund the company aims to expand its business by increasing employees from the current 160 to 250.

Overseas investors joined the round for the first time

It is rare for foreign funds such as Temasek and T. Rowe Price to invest in privately held Japanese companies but there have been a few cases in the past including Studyst and SuperStudio (both from Pavilion Capital) and Freee and Sansan (both from T. Rowe Price).

Global investments (mostly in the US) in the first half of 2021 totaled $288 billion up significantly from $110 billion in the same period last year. Among these investments Temasek has invested in 47 companies in the first half of 2021 alone. Temasek invested in 47 companies in the first half of 2021 alone while T. Rowe Price’s investments totaled $5 billion.

So why haven’t they paid more attention to Japanese startups so far? As I heard from a local investor typical overseas investors tend to evaluate deals based on market size. They simply evaluate companies based on their market cap so the upside is Apple as their market cap hit $2.4 trillion as of this writing.

Manwhile foreign investors are unlikely to invest in startups which cannot compete in the global arena. Conversely these investors recognized that Atama Plus CEO Inada and his team could compete globally. In fact Inada said that the reason for having foreign funds in this round is aiming for a global IPO.

Competing in the global market

According to Inada the global education market is estimated $3.8 trillion while $226 billion in Japan alone including $9 billion for cram and prep schools. The Yano Research Institute’s report (forecast as of 2019) says that the market of cram schools prep schools language learning and qualification courses is estimated to be about $25.3 billion with Benesse at the top of the industry with sales of about $4 billion while other businesses scattered across the country.

Meanwhile as shown in the list of unicorns Asian startups are making remarkable progress in the global education market. In particular India’s Byju’s (valued at $16.5 billion) and China’s Yuanfudao (valued at $15.5 billion) may be definite rivals for Atama Plus in the global competition because both of the startups were founded back in 2017 when Atama Plus was so. By the way Japanese largest education company Benesse is valued at about $2.4 billion (as of this writing).

Inada and his team’s idea wants to take a firm position as a top player by starting with cram and prep schools in Japan first (there about 50000 schools nationwide) while at the same time expanding the business beyond cram and prep school materials such as online mock exams and the joint project with Ritsumeikan. The platform used to have a problem taking a long time for onboarding but now it has been streamlined and the introduction to cram and prep schools has become smoother than before.

Inada thinks that the education market in China and India is still under development and the challenge there is offering better access to education rather than pursuing the quality of learning materials. The inflated valuations of education startups in these markets are much dependent on marketing-led growth but his company may have a better chance of winning the competition with the quality of products he says.

Merpay’s Aoyagi joined the board

Prior to the latest funding Merpay CEO Naoki Aoyagi joined the advisory board of Atama Plus. Inada’s intention having him on the board is to learn how to compete in the global market. In the past decade we haven’t seen that many tech entrepreneurs from Japan challenging the world.

Aoyagi is around Inada’s age and his experience having startups like Gree and Merpay grown up to giants will certainly be very beneficial for Inada’s team. Atama Plus uses the funds to expand to 250 employees and such a growth at a startups is the first-time experience for Inada even if he has worked at the education business unit at an enterprise like Mitsui & Co. Inada wants to property deal properly with growing pains that may occur in the future by learning from him in advance.

The company’s latest funding has a huge potential in terms of not only a rare case of funding for a Japanese startup from global institutional investors but also a case study of those looking at global expansion. We’ll keep our eyes on how they will fare from now on.

Apart from a Game Boy in the 1990s the first console I owned was a Nintendo Switch that I bought in early 2018 to play The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. I finally got around to buying a PlayStation 4 in the latter part of the same year. So it’s no surprise that when I first announced to a few experienced gamer friends and colleagues that I was going to play Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice most of them suggested I try another game first or maybe not bother playing it at all.

For those who have never played it 2019’s Sekiro is the downhill skiing of video games: it looks fairly easy and straightforward when you’re watching someone else play it in a video but it’s a whole other level of hard when you try it for yourself. Sekiro is a game that requires exquisitely timed sword attacks parries and deflections against an array of staggeringly powerful enemies. Everything happens much faster than you anticipate and even the tiniest errors have dire consequences.

“Sekiro is very hard” my friends warned me. “How hard can it be?” thought I. Today if someone were to ask me to rank Sekiro’s hardness factor on a scale of 1-10 I’d put it somewhere around 12.

This is the story of how I tried and failed then tried again and succeeded to beat this ridiculously hard infuriating frustrating exhilarating and utterly extraordinary video game that became my obsession.

Part I: Trial and Terror

On Saturday June 15 2019 at 7:42 p.m. EDT I downloaded Sekiro to my PS4 for the first time. Almost as soon as I started playing I understood exactly why I had been warned about the difficulty. I quickly became bogged down in the Ashina Outskirts area of the game having my ass handed to me repeatedly by minor foot soldiers who would floor me in just two or three hits. I had serious doubts that I would ever make it to the first miniboss let alone to the end of the game.

As frustrating as it was to be locked in this Groundhog Day-like loop of death it was more infuriating to know that it was entirely my own fault. Every time I was pummeled by a single stroke I knew exactly why: I had been too late with my deflection I had pushed the wrong button I had accidentally unlocked my target because I was squeezing the controller too tight. When I rushed or panicked I died. Every. Single. Time. There was no mystery to my failure.

There are no shortcuts to learning Sekiro; the game simply wouldn’t let me progress until I figured out exactly how to play

Yet it was only by going through this seemingly endless cycle of defeat that I began to understand why I was so bad. There are no shortcuts to learning Sekiro; the game simply wouldn’t let me progress until I figured out exactly how to play. Developer FromSoftware’s gameplay design forced me to put in the time to learn the mechanics and to fully embrace the fact that I was going to die. A lot.

I knew I’d have to really focus and concentrate. I spent time reading through Polygon’s guides and top tips practicing fighting with Hanbei the Undying (a character specifically designed to test and perfect your skills without the risk of losing gold or HP in the process) and playing the game as much as possible. I began to make some incremental progress. I worked my way through the Ashina Outskirts and defeated my first miniboss General Naomori Kawarada before getting completely stuck trying to take out the Chained Ogre. I would get through the first phase of the ogre fight only to be stomped or crushed or broken seemingly one or two swings away from victory. Even a lengthy side-slog through the Hirata Estate to pick up the Flame Vent prosthetic tool didn’t help.

My breakthrough came after a friend suggested I sneak up behind the ogre for a free death blow to shorten the fight. It had never occurred to me to try to sneak up on a boss which I assumed was just another way to get stomped. But it worked.

My takeaway from defeating the Chained Ogre and from working my way through the fights in the Hirata Estate was that my progression through Sekiro was just as dependent on learning when to fight as it was on learning how to fight. Rushing into any melee without a plan would result in my immediate demise. It paid to think first and attack second.

One of the hardest miniboss fights in the Ashina Outskirts section (or the entire game for that matter) is Seven Ashina Spears - Shikibu Toshikatsu Yamauchi. Not only is this one hell of a powerful miniboss but you have to wade through a veritable army of swordsmen riflemen spearmen and mallet- and club-wielding Taro soldiers just to reach him in the first place. Trying to sneak around these foot soldiers isn’t a wise option; they will simply join the fray if you attempt to take on Yamauchi without taking them out first. I spent valuable time working through these grunts only to fall to Yamauchi within a couple of blows and have to start over. It was the exact same scenario with Juzou the Drunkard in the Hirata Estate: I would take my time to get through the foot soldiers with minimal damage only to lose to the miniboss in an instant. It was beyond frustrating. I managed to beat both Yamauchi and the Drunkard eventually but it took me hours upon hours to do it.

After literally hundreds of hours of play I found myself facing two insurmountable obstacles where nothing I had learned seemed to work: Lady Butterfly and Genichiro Ashina. Lady Butterfly is a tricky two-phase boss in a burning cavernous hall at the end of the Hirata estate; Genichiro Ashina is an incredibly powerful three-phase boss you face atop Ashina Castle.

Try as I might I couldn’t get beyond even the first phase of either fight. I was hit by the realization that after almost five months playing Sekiro I had progressed through less than 10% of a very difficult game that was only ever going to get even harder. I had to accept the fact that I was done. Sekiro was simply too hard for me. It was time to cut my losses move on and play something else.

Part II: Run away and live to fight another day

Sekiro was still very much in my head even as I moved on to other games. I loved the game and it bothered me that I’d quit. No matter what else I played I found myself comparing it to Sekiro even if there wasn’t a logical comparison to be made.

Death Stranding was like wading through mud for no good reason: It wasn’t exactly hard just a rather annoying and pointless experience

In early November 2019 I started playing Death Stranding. I thought the game was a technical marvel and I loved the design and art direction but I found it unbelievably tedious to play. Death Stranding was like wading through mud for no good reason: It wasn’t exactly hard just a rather annoying and pointless experience. I decided that if I had to struggle with a game I would rather that game be Sekiro.

I started playing Sekiro once again to see if I still found it as hard as before. I did.

So I gave Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order a try. My first step was to remap my PS4 controller to match the button layout for Sekiro because seriously why would I have it set up any other way? I also set the game to its easiest difficulty level because again if I was going to put any time and effort into playing a hard game it definitely wasn’t going to be Fallen Order. I blasted through the game in a matter of weeks and found it an enjoyable romp but nothing special.

Control on the other hand was an extraordinary challenging and deeply atmospheric game. The design was exceptional with stunning art direction (I thoroughly recommend the limited-edition book featuring the concept art) and a decent story. I enjoyed Control so much that I began to think that maybe I’d been right to put Sekiro behind me.

Outer Wilds was another wonderful distraction. I thought Polygon’s 2019 game of the year was a creative breath of fresh air; a clever beautiful experience that was the “most not-at-all-like-Sekiro” game I had played in months.

In the fall of 2020 I started Ghost of Tsushima. I thought of it as Breath of the Wild Sekiro or Samurai Red Dead Redemption. Yes I wished it was possible to lock onto the target during a fight and yes the game was a little formulaic and repetitive. But the story wasn’t bad and the landscapes were stunning. Perhaps most importantly it was just difficult enough to be a challenge without being controller-throwing impossible like Sekiro. I beat Ghost of Tsushima on the game’s default settings and started a second run in the new game plus mode almost immediately.

As fall turned to winter I started (but didn’t finish) Assassin’s Creed Valhalla (very meh) and Hades (which is great if a little frantic). I also began to wonder whether it was the perfect time to pick Sekiro up again. I felt like I’d learned a lot playing these other games. Maybe Sekiro wouldn’t feel quite so hard this time?

On the second to last day of 2020 I booted up Sekiro for the first time in many months.

Part III: Shadows Play Twice

My save file had become corrupted and wouldn’t open. I’d lost over 200 hours of progress and was faced with no option but to start again from the very beginning.

Oddly enough what had first appeared to be a monumental disaster quickly morphed into a blessing of sorts. Starting the game fresh gave me the opportunity to play in a far more deliberate methodical manner than my first rather naïve fumbling attempt.

This time I really took my time planning my route through each section and giving careful consideration to the order in which I would fight each of the enemies. I learned to better manage my Vitality and Posture taking steps to conserve them both as much as possible to give me a better chance of winning difficult fights. I dove back into the guides and read them much more studiously. And I watched as many different boss fights on YouTube as possible. I even went back to looking through the Official Artworks book for inspiration (the book had cut me when I first opened it which I considered perfectly on-brand). Over time I became so deeply obsessed with the game that I found myself playing it my dreams and its visuals bled into my waking life.

I played as much as I could during the long dark winter evenings working my way through the Hirata Estate and the Ashina Outskirts and Ashina Castle. After taking out the minibosses I would run back through the different sections a number of times to farm the XP and gold I needed to upgrade my prosthetic tools and to speed my progress through the skills tree. I did this in order to prepare myself for the upcoming rematch boss fights with Lady Butterfly and Genichiro Ashina.

Even so both fights were still stupendously hard. I would hazard a guess that it took me at least 100 attempts to get through each of them maybe even more to beat Ashina — he did have three phases after all. But this time I knew exactly what to expect. I had prepared. My deflection timing was more precise I was better able to manage my Posture and I had a wider variety of Combat Arts to choose from. Most importantly I had fully embraced the reality that both fights were very difficult and that the only way for me to triumph was to try again and again and again. The elation of delivering those final death blows was extraordinary. I felt like a huge weight had been lifted like I had finally atoned for all my past failures.

The game now opened up for me. Over the following weeks and months I discovered new areas — including some like the Sunken Valley and the ludicrously well-protected Gun Fort — that I had completely missed on my first playthrough. I worked my way through the poison pools of the Ashina Depths I cleared the misty Hidden Forest and the creepy Mibu Village and I made it to the final area on the map: the Fountainhead Palace.

Each new area I discovered and every boss and miniboss I encountered only reinforced my earlier belief that Sekiro would only ever get harder

Each new area I discovered and every boss and miniboss I encountered only reinforced my earlier belief that Sekiro would only ever get harder. The game kept surprising me like adding Apparition enemies that required a completely new set of skills prosthetic tools and Combat Arts to defeat. But what I hadn’t previously considered was that I would get better at playing the game — and not just in terms of technique and increased stamina and attack power. As I learned more about how the game worked I found new ways to make it work for me.

For example once I had made it to the Fountainhead Palace I would regularly return to the Flower Viewing Stage Sculptor’s Idol to farm gold spirit emblems and XP since I could quickly collect so much more of them in this spot than in any other area of the game. Running back from the ruined bridge the two Palace Nobles would yield 530 XP each and the Okami Elite Lightning Naginata warrior an additional 1060 XP making it fairly easy to accrue cash and skill points.

After collecting the three pieces of the Dancing Dragon Mask I could use this process to upgrade my attack power too. It just took time. To gain one skill point I would have to complete the same 25-second (ish) run at least 24 times which meant completing at least 120 runs to gain the five skill points needed to increase my attack power by 1. The bonus was that I would also make well over 33000 sen and collect a ton of Spirit Emblems along the way. It was a tedious grind but well worth the time spent.

As I worked my way through the game’s major bosses I returned to the Sculptor’s Idol on at least four separate occasions. Though the increased attack power undoubtedly made a difference in the subsequent boss fights in reality the only tool that really helped me to beat them was lots and lots of practice.

Even so some boss fights were much easier (a relative term) than I had expected. The True Monk battle seemed to be over far more quickly than I anticipated which stood in stark contrast to my fight with the Guardian Ape which was a seemingly never-ending slog of epic proportions even though it only had two phases and some fairly predictable Perilous Attacks. But by far the hardest and least surprising fight of them all was the final boss battle of the game: Genichiro Way of Tomoe and Isshin the Sword Saint.

On May 27 with an attack power of 14 High Monk selected as my chosen Combat Art Suzaku’s Lotus Umbrella at the ready and the Tanto on hand to grant me those precious five extra Spirit Emblems I began the final boss fight in Sekiro.

Part IV: This is the end

On Friday June 25 2021 at approximately 6:55 p.m. EDT I finally beat Isshin the Sword Saint — and with it the game. Although my second playthrough of Sekiro had taken me a little over 127 hours to complete the reality is that it took me two years and 10 days.

Of course this wasn’t the end of the game just the story. I still had the Demon of Hatred (technically an optional boss) and the five Headless to beat. Before attempting the Demon of Hatred battle I went on a side quest to find the Malcontent Ring — a valuable upgrade for the Finger Whistle Prosthetic Tool — and stumbled completely by accident upon the Headless Ape and Mate. To my utter surprise I dispatched them both on my very first attempt the easiest (again a relative term) boss fight I had in the entire game.

The Demon of Hatred was not easy but I got through it. I then took my newfound confidence as a beater-of-Sekiro-bosses and worked my way quickly through all five Headless. It helped that my attack power was now at 19 but I also found that copious use of Phoenix’s Lilac Umbrella accompanied by the Projected Force skill came in very handy.

My two-year adventure playing Sekiro is finally at an end

And with that I am done. My two-year adventure playing Sekiro is finally at an end. It has been a long and at times emotional journey to get through what has undoubtedly been the hardest but most rewarding video game I have ever played.

For now I’m going to sit back and play some fun easy games for a while. I considered playing the Demon’s Souls remake but decided instead to take some time to prepare for the next FromSoftware challenge. Armed with all of my experience playing Sekiro I hereby declare that I am confident I will have beaten Elden Ring by mid-2024. Maybe early 2023 if I get really good.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmlnbi5jb20vd2lraXMvbWFzcy1lZmZlY3QtMy9HZW5lc2lzXzLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Genesis 2 - Mass Effect 3 Guide,"Mass Effect: Genesis 2 is an optional interactive DLC comic that is enabled after you finish setting up your Mass Effect 3 profile. It was introduced in 2012 for the Wii U port of Mass Effect 3 since that system never received Mass Effect 1 or 2. It was later made available for Xbox 360 PC and PlayStation 3 players as well and is included for free in the Legendary Edition.

Using Mass Effect: Genesis 2 the player gets an abridged summary of Mass Effect 1 and 2's plots detailing important story beats and allowing them to make the six most important choices in the game's story including who they Romance. Unlike the original Genesis however those importing a Mass Effect 2 profile will NOT see it to get a summary of their choices. This is because in Genesis 2 it's impossible to reflect the many permutations of which Squad Mates are alive and if they're Loyal or not.

In the original release of Mass Effect 3 Mass Effect: Genesis 2 activates automatically every time you start a new game. This includes New Game Plus so if you find this redundant or bothersome you should uninstall it before starting the story again.



In the Legendary Edition you're prompted for if you want to use Mass Effect: Genesis 2 (since it's included by default in that version) allowing you to skip it if you want.

All Mass Effect: Genesis 2 Choices

You get to make the twelve most major choices of Mass Effect 1 and Mass Effect 2's stories via the Mass Effect: Genesis 2 comic. While seven of them are normally tied to a specific Morality you don't earn any by doing them through the Genesis 2 comic.

In an exchange of public letters in 2019 they told Amnesty International and other activists that they would do “whatever is necessary” to ensure NSO’s weapons-grade software would only be used to fight crime and terrorism.

But the claim it now appears was hollow.

Unknown to the activists NSO would later hatch a deal that would help a longtime government client with an awful human rights record. Dubai a monarchy in the United Arab Emirates wanted NSO to give it permission to expand its potential use of the spyware so it could target mobile phones in the UK.

Quick Guide What is in the Pegasus project data? Show What is in the data leak? The data leak is a list of more than 50000 phone numbers that since 2016 are believed to have been selected as those of people of interest by government clients of NSO Group which sells surveillance software. The data also contains the time and date that numbers were selected or entered on to a system. Forbidden Stories a Paris-based nonprofit journalism organisation and Amnesty International initially had access to the list and shared access with 16 media organisations including the Guardian. More than 80 journalists have worked together over several months as part of the Pegasus project. Amnesty’s Security Lab a technical partner on the project did the forensic analyses. What does the leak indicate? The consortium believes the data indicates the potential targets NSO’s government clients identified in advance of possible surveillance. While the data is an indication of intent the presence of a number in the data does not reveal whether there was an attempt to infect the phone with spyware such as Pegasus the company’s signature surveillance tool or whether any attempt succeeded. The presence in the data of a very small number of landlines and US numbers which NSO says are “technically impossible” to access with its tools reveals some targets were selected by NSO clients even though they could not be infected with Pegasus. However forensic examinations of a small sample of mobile phones with numbers on the list found tight correlations between the time and date of a number in the data and the start of Pegasus activity – in some cases as little as a few seconds. What did forensic analysis reveal? Amnesty examined 67 smartphones where attacks were suspected. Of those 23 were successfully infected and 14 showed signs of attempted penetration. For the remaining 30 the tests were inconclusive in several cases because the handsets had been replaced. Fifteen of the phones were Android devices none of which showed evidence of successful infection. However unlike iPhones phones that use Android do not log the kinds of information required for Amnesty’s detective work. Three Android phones showed signs of targeting such as Pegasus-linked SMS messages. Amnesty shared “backup copies” of four iPhones with Citizen Lab a research group at the University of Toronto that specialises in studying Pegasus which confirmed that they showed signs of Pegasus infection. Citizen Lab also conducted a peer review of Amnesty’s forensic methods and found them to be sound. Which NSO clients were selecting numbers? While the data is organised into clusters indicative of individual NSO clients it does not say which NSO client was responsible for selecting any given number. NSO claims to sell its tools to 60 clients in 40 countries but refuses to identify them. By closely examining the pattern of targeting by individual clients in the leaked data media partners were able to identify 10 governments believed to be responsible for selecting the targets: Azerbaijan Bahrain Kazakhstan Mexico Morocco Rwanda Saudi Arabia Hungary India and the United Arab Emirates. Citizen Lab has also found evidence of all 10 being clients of NSO. What does NSO Group say? You can read NSO Group’s full statement here. The company has always said it does not have access to the data of its customers’ targets. Through its lawyers NSO said the consortium had made “incorrect assumptions” about which clients use the company’s technology. It said the 50000 number was “exaggerated” and that the list could not be a list of numbers “targeted by governments using Pegasus”. The lawyers said NSO had reason to believe the list accessed by the consortium “is not a list of numbers targeted by governments using Pegasus but instead may be part of a larger list of numbers that might have been used by NSO Group customers for other purposes”. They said it was a list of numbers that anyone could search on an open source system. After further questions the lawyers said the consortium was basing its findings “on misleading interpretation of leaked data from accessible and overt basic information such as HLR Lookup services which have no bearing on the list of the customers' targets of Pegasus or any other NSO products ... we still do not see any correlation of these lists to anything related to use of NSO Group technologies”. Following publication they explained that they considered a ""target"" to be a phone that was the subject of a successful or attempted (but failed) infection by Pegasus and reiterated that the list of 50000 phones was too large for it to represent ""targets"" of Pegasus. They said that the fact that a number appeared on the list was in no way indicative of whether it had been selected for surveillance using Pegasus. What is HLR lookup data? The term HLR or home location register refers to a database that is essential to operating mobile phone networks. Such registers keep records on the networks of phone users and their general locations along with other identifying information that is used routinely in routing calls and texts. Telecoms and surveillance experts say HLR data can sometimes be used in the early phase of a surveillance attempt when identifying whether it is possible to connect to a phone. The consortium understands NSO clients have the capability through an interface on the Pegasus system to conduct HLR lookup inquiries. It is unclear whether Pegasus operators are required to conduct HRL lookup inquiries via its interface to use its software; an NSO source stressed its clients may have different reasons – unrelated to Pegasus – for conducting HLR lookups via an NSO system.

It needed to do so it argued to track down drug dealers using foreign sim cards to evade surveillance.

Insiders at the company were hesitant a person familiar with the matter said. It was a risky proposition given the track record of customers such as the UAE. In 2016 it had tried to use NSO spyware to hack the phone of one of the most outspoken and respected Emirati human rights activists Ahmed Mansoor. He was imprisoned by Emirati authorities one year later and is still in jail.

But the Guardian has been told an NSO committee reviewing the deal agreed to Dubai’s request. Potentially it meant that authorities in Dubai would be able to bypass privacy and anti-hacking laws that would usually protect individuals living in democracies from being spied on without a warrant and having their phones hacked by a foreign government.

Some of the people in whom authorities showed a possible interest leaked records now indicate were not drug dealers at all. They were human rights activists and dissidents living in exile.

Using NSO’s signature software Pegasus Dubai’s rulers could seek to infiltrate any mobile phone they wanted in the UK eavesdrop on calls look at photos read text messages and even turn a phone’s microphone or camera on remotely. In most cases they could do it without leaving a digital fingerprint.

This is the power of NSO’s spyware – and why countries from Mexico to Saudi Arabia Rwanda and India appear to have been willing to pay a high price for its capabilities.

This week the Pegasus project a media collaboration that included the Guardian and was coordinated by the French media group Forbidden Stories revealed new allegations of abuse with leaked records showing the phone numbers of journalists dissidents and political activists.

Q&A What is the Pegasus project? Show The Pegasus project is a collaborative journalistic investigation into the NSO Group and its clients. The company sells surveillance technology to governments worldwide. Its flagship product is Pegasus spying software – or spyware – that targets iPhones and Android devices. Once a phone is infected a Pegasus operator can secretly extract chats photos emails and location data or activate microphones and cameras without a user knowing. Forbidden Stories a Paris-based nonprofit journalism organisation and Amnesty International had access to a leak of more than 50000 phone numbers selected as targets by clients of NSO since 2016. Access to the data was then shared with the Guardian and 16 other news organisations including the Washington Post Le Monde Die Zeit and Süddeutsche Zeitung. More than 80 journalists have worked collaboratively over several months on the investigation which was coordinated by Forbidden Stories. Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback.

The database which was the heart of the Pegasus project investigation included the phone details of 13 heads of state as well as diplomats military chiefs and senior politicians from 34 countries.

Others whose numbers appear on the leaked list include the French president most of his cabinet reporters in Hungary and Mexico 400 people in the UK including a member of the House of Lords two princesses – and a horse trainer.

Forensic analysis of a small sample from the database has shown some phones on the list were infected.

But the presence of a phone number in the data does not reveal whether a device was infected with Pegasus or subject to an attempted hack.

NSO has denied the database of numbers has anything to do with it or its customers. It says it has no visibility into its clients’ activities and said the reporting consortium had made “incorrect assumptions” about which clients used the company’s technology.

NSO said the fact that a number appeared on the leaked list was in no way indicative of whether a number was targeted for surveillance using Pegasus. NSO also says the database has “no relevance” to the company.

It said it may be part of a larger list of numbers that might have been used by NSO Group customers “for other purposes”.

No country has admitted being a customer of NSO’s technology.

Under surveillance: the company and its clients

From humble beginnings in 2010 NSO has become in effect a company that helps its clients spy on the world. This week the Pegasus projecthas raised new concerns about the scale and depth of the surveillance campaigns pursued by the company’s government clients – and more generally the lack of regulations around the many firms that now sell military-grade spyware.

Based in Herzliya NSO Group has come a long way in a short period. The name is derived from the initials of the men who launched it: the friends Niv Carmi Shalev Hulio and Omri Lavie.

Hulio who served in the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) has said the idea for the company came after he and Lavie received a phone call from a European intelligence service which had learned the pair had the know-how to access people’s phones.

“Why aren’t you using this to collect intelligence?” the agency is said to have asked.

The proliferation of smartphones and encrypted communications technology from Signal to WhatsApp and Telegram meant intelligence and law enforcement agencies had gone “dark” unable to monitor the activities of terrorists paedophiles and other criminals.

“They said we didn’t really understand that the situation was grave” Hulio recalled. So grave in fact that when NSO began selling its technology it quickly expanded and currently employs about 750 staff.

The company is the world leader in a niche market: providing states with “off the shelf” cyber capabilities that allow them to compete with the National Security Agency (NSA) in the US and the UK’s GCHQ.

From the start NSO cultivated an image as a cutting-edge crime fighter whose surveillance tools were used to stop terrorists. “This is really for the Bin Ladens of the world” Tami Mazel Shachar then a co-president of NSO Group told 60 Minutes in 2019.

The firm has also said it is the antithesis of a mass surveillance company with clients allegedly handling fewer than 100 targets at any given time. A source familiar with the matter said the average number of annual targets per customer was 112.

Incidents of abuse the company has suggested are rare and investigated by compliance officials. When allegations of abuse have emerged the company has said it cannot disclose the identities of its government clients. A person familiar with NSO operations who spoke on the condition of anonymity said that in the last year alone it had terminated contracts with Saudi Arabia and Dubai in the United Arab Emirates over human rights concerns.

‘Digital spy in your pocket’

The Pegasus project has raised new questions about this narrative. It has also highlighted the Israeli government’s close links to the company.

“The [company’s] regulations are a state secret” said one insider. But the group is ultimately guided by one golden rule: “There are three jurisdictions you don’t fuck with: the US Israel and the Russians.”

Its first client in 2011 was Mexico a country that remains a major importer of spyware.

Over an 18-month period in 2016-17 the numbers of more than 15000 people in Mexico appeared on the leaked database. They included the phone numbers of dozens of journalists editors and at least 50 people close to the country’s current president Andrés Manuel López Obrador .

This doesn’t mean they were subject to an attempted hack using Pegasus or were infected with it. It does suggest some government clients of NSO Group had a pool of Mexican people they were interested in.

Mexico has been accused before. In 2020 media reports began to emerge documenting serious abuses of NSO’s technology including the targeting of international experts who were examining the case of 43 students who disappeared after they were abducted by police.

Around the same time halfway across the world another client of NSO was sending Mansoor suspicious text messages on his iPhone. When he sent the links to researchers at Citizen Lab which is affiliated with the University of Toronto it found the link was infected with malware made by the Israeli company. Clicking it would have turned Mansoor’s phone into a “digital spy in his pocket” tracking his movements and listening to his calls.

Within a year of the discovery security forces raided Mansoor’s home and arrested him. A report by Human Rights Watch found Mansoor – a father of four who has been described as a poet and an engineer – spent years in an isolation cell following his arrest. His “crimes” included WhatsApp exchanges with human rights organisations.

In October 2018 NSO faced a barrage of criticism after Citizen Lab announced it had discovered that a device belonging to another dissident a Saudi named Omar Abdulaziz who was living in exile in Canada had been infected by malware.

It was only a few days later following the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul that the significance of Abdulaziz’s targeting would become evident.

Khashoggi and Abdulaziz had been in touch with each other. In interviews and in a court filing Abdulaziz said he believed the targeting had been a “crucial factor” in the killing of the Washington Post journalist and the harassment and imprisonment of his own family in the kingdom.

One former official told the Guardian the US uncovered signs that surveillance was a factor in the killing. “We did notice they [Saudi Arabia] had focused on him. We didn’t know that until after the murder but we did find intercepts of people talking about surveilling journalists. I don’t know if that was NSO” said Kirsten Fontenrose a senior official at the US National Security Council covering Saudi Arabia at the time.

Khashoggi’s fiancee Hatice Cengiz was hacked using Pegasus by an NSO client – believed to be Saudi Arabia – four days after the journalist was killed according to an examination of her phone by Amnesty International’s security lab. Other friends and associates of the journalist were also hacked or targeted by the company’s clients. Within months of the murder Saudi Arabia was cut off from NSO though its access would be reinstated within six months.

In a statement NSO said: “Our technology was not associated in any way with the heinous murder of Jamal Khashoggi. We can confirm that our technology was not used to listen monitor track or collect information regarding him or his family members mentioned in your inquiry.”

New owners new concerns

In 2019 the US-based private equity fund Francisco Partners decided to sell NSO Group to a new group of investors. The deal was led by a London-based firm called Novalpina Capital whose fund bought a majority stake of the company along with the founders of NSO in an acquisition valued at about $1bn.

At Novalpina Capital debate ensued internally about how the private equity firm should approach its new investment according to a person familiar with the matter. NSO was not a household name but despite its claims that its spyware was saving lives by preventing terrorist attacks human rights organisations were asking searching questions of the group.

In April Amnesty International among others signed a letter addressed to Novalpina demanding accountability for the targeting of “a wide swath of civil society” including two dozen human rights defenders in Mexico one of its own employees Abdulaziz Mansoor Ghanem Almasarir a London-based Saudi satirist and Yahya Assiri another Saudi activist.

Amnesty said: “These individuals and organisations appear to have been targeted solely as a result of their criticism of governments that utilised the spyware or because of their work bearing on human rights issues of political sensitivity to those governments. Thus this targeting is in violation of internationally recognised human rights.”

Stephen Peel a British financier and co-founder of Novalpina led an effort by the private equity firm to engage with the human rights groups and researchers who had been sounding alarms about its practices for years. In a lengthy exchange of letters with Amnesty signed by Novalpina Peel promised to tackle their concerns.

Within months of making that pledge two sources familiar with the matter said Dubai was allowed to expand its use of the spyware into the UK. In September 2019 the company also unveiled a new human rights policy and adopted “guiding principles” to protect vulnerable populations including journalists and activists. In the meantime allegations of abuse by NSO clients kept streaming in.

WhatsApp takes action

Then another technology giant entered the fray.

In October 2019 WhatsApp revealed that 1400 of its users had been targeted with Pegasus through a vulnerability in its app. Individuals who were affected by the attack and were alerted by WhatsApp included members of the clergy in Togo and dozens of journalists in India Rwanda and Morocco.

“The really big tectonic shift in our understanding of NSO’s capabilities happened around the WhatsApp attack when we just saw obviously a raft of zero-click attacks. And that’s just like another order of magnitude of sophistication” said John Scott-Railton a senior researcher at Citizen Lab.

In a continuing legal battle over the case NSO argued before a US court that it ought to be granted immunity in the case because the company’s software had been used on behalf of foreign government clients without its knowledge or approval.

Being a client of NSO said one person who previously served as a broker in the industry was a bit like gun ownership in the US.

“You are supposed to use a gun to protect yourself but who is to stop you from robbing a bank?” they said. “You ask me whether it was known by NSO that Pegasus would be used to go after journalists human rights activists I would tell you of course they knew. That is my opinion. Of course everyone understands that. But has it been said? Did they say ‘we will use it for regime opponents’? No they did not say that.”

The Guardian put a series of questions to NSO and Novalpina about its dealings with the UAE. They declined to comment.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvam9hbnZlcmRvbi8yMDIxLzA3LzI1L3N1c3RhaW5hYmxlLXNlbGxpbmctaG93LXBsYXN0aWNhbmQtcGFja2FnZS1mcmVlLWlzLXJlc2hhcGluZy1yZXRhaWwv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sustainable Selling: How Plastic- And Package-Free Stores Are Reshaping Retail,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/joanverdon/2021/07/25/sustainable-selling-how-plasticand-package-free-is-reshaping-retail/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvam9hbnZlcmRvbi8yMDIxLzA3LzI1L3N1c3RhaW5hYmxlLXNlbGxpbmctaG93LXBsYXN0aWNhbmQtcGFja2FnZS1mcmVlLWlzLXJlc2hhcGluZy1yZXRhaWwv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFya2Fuc2Fzb25saW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvanVsLzI1L2JhbmtpbmctZ2lhbnQtdGFrZXMtYS0xc3Qtc3RlcC1pbi1zdGF0ZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Banking giant takes a 1st step in state | Arkansas Democrat Gazette,"JPMorgan Chase & Co. is the biggest banking firm in the United States and one of the biggest in the world with $3.7 trillion in assets but until the past few years lacked the physical footprint on U.S. soil to match its financial heft.

That began to change in 2018 when the bank embarked on a quest to open 400 bank branches in new markets in the United States and become the first American bank to have a presence in every state but Alaska and Hawaii.

Chase the U.S. consumer and commercial banking business of JP Morgan Chase & Co. opened the first of its planned five branch locations in Central Arkansas earlier this month one of more than 60 branches the bank has opened around the nation this year.

Chase's presence in Arkansas was mostly limited to credit card services. In Arkansas Chase has 350000 credit card holders. It also has 14000 business accounts in the state.

""As a credit card company we've been servicing people across the country for 20 years or more"" said Dan Deegan who has led the national expansion effort for Chase.

Deegan was in town last week to help mark the formal opening of the Chase branch at 12900 Chenal Parkway. He and other bank executives were welcomed by Little Rock Mayor Frank Scott Jr.

""As a former banker I know how important banks are to a local economy"" Scott said at a ribbon-cutting ceremony. ""You are job creators You are job sustainers.""

Investing in new buildings may appear old school with the covid-19 pandemic accelerating the public's move to online banking and with many banks closing or limiting access to their lobbies.

But physical locations continue to play an important role in banking Deegan said.

""Through covid people have had to embrace technology even faster than they thought they would. We've certainly seen that"" he said. ""But people still like the idea [of being] face-to-face with someone and ask the questions that are sometimes more complicated: 'I want to get a mortgage I want to get an auto loan I want to get the right checking account.'""

Still technology killed the traffic at bank branches.

""They don't need to come as frequently as they did five or 10 years ago to the bank"" Deegan said. ""Direct deposit probably being the most impactful thing that has changed foot traffic. But we still have almost a million customers a day coming to our footprint of branches nationwide.""

Chase has 4960 locations in 44 states including the branch on Chenal Parkway according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

Still the concept of a branch has adapted to 21st Century sensibilities. There's no big lobby dominated by teller windows. Instead there are just two teller windows now called transaction windows.

The branch has six offices around the central lobby area. Associate bankers greet customers a tablet computer in their hands for setting appointments and other services.

The branch has a total of four automated teller machines commonly called ATMs. One is for drive-thru customers and another is for walk-up customers. Two more are inside a preference Chase has detected among its customers.

The ATM options ""make banking easy and convenient"" said Kyle Rhodes the branch manager. ""Do what you want when you want.""

But even Rhodes a banking industry veteran made a jarring discovery on his first day at the branch involving the big walk-in vault. The branch didn't have one.

""No big wheel or big lever to turn or needing two people to push the door"" he said.

Chase has four other branches -- three more in Little Rock and one in North Little Rock -- in various stages of development or construction.

All are in high traffic areas. The Chenal Parkway branch is situated next to a Target and Home Depot.

Chase is scheduled to open new branch banks at Cantrell Road and Southridge Drive one in Midtown in Little Rock and one on East McCain Boulevard in North Little Rock. The fifth branch will be at Chenal Parkway and Kirk Road.

""Locations are critical for us"" Deegan said. ""Three key things drive the selection. We want to be near where you live where you work where you shop.

""Clearly with Target and Home Depot here this is a convenient place where people are shopping. Ideally if we could hit all three of those buckets that will be convenient to our customers.""

Technology is a feature that limits the expansion.

""Years ago we might have built more because people relied exclusively on branches"" Deegan said. ""Now they do a combination of both.""

Chase plans to use the expanded branch footprint to develop new business with existing customers.

""What we have found surprisingly is our credit card customers consider themselves Chase customers already"" Deegan said. ""They just didn't have the opportunity to do branch banking.

""What we do is literally reach out to them whether it's by phone email or letter just to let them know 'Hey we now have a branch in Little Rock. If you'd like to learn about other ways Chase can help you feel free to come in.'

""So far over 10% of the accounts we've opened at all the other branches have come from credit-card-only customers that were there already and then we introduced them to the branch.""

Longtime Chase customer Caitlyn Schmidt a California native who moved to Hot Springs earlier this year made arrangements to continue her California work on the Upwork freelancing platform but she said ""when it came time to transfer funds I was denied the transfer due to name mismatch by Upwork"" because she didn't change her name on the Chase account when she married.

The only way to change the name on her account was to visit a bank branch. Before the Little Rock branch opened the closest one was 400 miles away she said.

Word that Chase opened a branch in Little Rock as a result left her ""overjoyed.""

""I was eventually able to complete the name change and only drove about an hour away"" Schmidt said in an email.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy8xMC1iZXN0LW1lZGljYWwtc3RvY2tzLXVuZGVyLTIyMjAzMzIwMy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,10 Best Medical Stocks Under $10,"In this article we will take a look at the 10 best medical stocks under $10.

Well if you have the same problem I and other people have it is not the heat pump making noise but one or both the water pumps of the cooling system. Also Tesla told you that the noise is ""normal"" compared to other Model Ys... be careful they tend to dismiss anything that is not related to safety or major technical issues so I wouldn't trust them on that. First of all: did they compare it to previous Model Ys? Or to recent model Ys?It is my understanding that those pumps should be running always to cool the whole system (batteries and computer included). I hear a very subtle buzzing sound running all the time on my Model 3 as well but it is so quiet you can barely hear it in the garage with no other sound around. And I had the same kind of buzzing with my previous Model S and Model X. So I think that's normal for those pumps to start running every time the car is ""engaged"" in some way. But they definitely shouldn't make that loud noise!If I were you I'd ask for clarifications from your SC. I'd go there personally asking for the technician who took care of your car and diagnosis and ask him to open the frunk and show you where the ""normal"" noise he's talking about is coming from. If it is coming from the heat pump you'll understand right away because the heat pump is located in the middle of the cooling system. If instead the noise is coming from the far left (if you look your car from the front) that's the water pumps!!Then I'd ask him what other production Model Y he has compared the noise to. And if he tells you it is one of the oldest ones ask him to do it again ""in your presence."" If instead he tells you that he compared it with another newer Model Y ask him to compare it with an older one (6-8 months at least) because the difference is between the new cars and the older ones.As I said earlier we all have to insist on all this.

In several articles this year my colleagues and I covered some of the problems with Tesla service and repair that lead to extreme repair bills for customers. After I discuss some of them I’m going to go over an industry-standard repair practice that Tesla could adopt and perhaps improve upon that would solve this problem.

The Problem

In my case I was test driving a Model Y when one of my passengers couldn’t hold lunch down resulting in Tesla’s employees telling me that the whole seat might need replaced. Tesla’s service centers don’t repair or replace small components in many cases so there was a chance I could be billed for the whole row of seats merely because a small amount of vomit went into one of the seatbelt clickers. In most other vehicles a seat belt clicker can be replaced for far under $100. For people raising a family puke and other messes are just about inevitable so big repair bills for a small mess isn’t a great thing.

I compared this to the Death Star in Star Wars Episode IV. In that film the protagonists exploit a weakness in a giant space station’s heat exhaust system allowing a small fighter-plane-like spacecraft to blow up a space station the size of a moon in just one shot.

I never heard back from Tesla about this nor has anyone made an insurance claim over the incident so they must have either figured out how to fix it or didn’t want any more bad publicity. The fact that I was threatened with a big bill over something that would normally cost around $30-50 to fix is still insane though.

My colleague Jo Borrás found an even bigger Death Star-type weakness when he discussed a $16000 repair bill a Tesla service center gave one Model 3 driver. The driver ran over some debris in the road like we all do sometimes when it can’t be avoided. Unfortunately the debris broke a plastic panel on the bottom of the vehicle and slammed into a coolant connection to the battery pack breaking it. At the Tesla service center they determined that it was part of the battery pack and that the entire pack would need replacement. Why? Because service centers don’t open battery packs and can only replace them.

This would have totaled the vehicle as the pack replacement cost exceeded half the cost of comparable replacement but the car’s owner decided to seek out a second opinion. He sought the help of Rich Benoit who runs the Rich Rebuilds Channel on YouTube. Benoit owns Electrified Garage an independent EV repair shop and despite the distance the owner had his car towed across states to get a better repair estimate from Rich.

It turned out that the battery pack’s thermal connection could be repaired for only $700. Electrified Garage figured out that they could repair the cracked tube using standard plumbing methods as the pressure in a Tesla’s coolant system isn’t very high. With the crack repaired and new coolant put back in the system the car ran just as if nothing ever happened.

Like Jo my colleague Steve Hanley went into detail about the wider issue of Right To Repair. Many manufacturers other than Tesla do what they can to get in the way of independent repair shops or the owners themselves servicing and repairing their products. This in turn has led to a whole movement against those practices with a quickening tempo of government action developing. Consumers in many cases simply want access to computer interfaces and the ability to get parts from somebody other than the original manufacturer as well as the ability to have independent mechanics and repair shops be as effective as possible.

Manufacturers are often resisting this making copyright and safety/integrity arguments against independent repairs and computing access. They’d have a point if their locked-down products weren’t causing real financial harm to consumers that’s entirely avoidable.

If you want to learn more about Tesla’s poor treatment of people who want to repair their cars independently I’d recommend you check out this video below at Rich Rebuilds. It’s pretty awful the way they’ve treated someone who was once a big enthusiast and supporter.

How Tesla Can Solve These Problems Increase Customer Satisfaction and Improve Its Image

Before we discuss the logistical changes needed to avoid high repair bills for relatively minor issues we need to talk about a philosophical shift that needs to happen at Tesla. The fundamental problem is that the company wants to control the vehicles when the company really should treat the vehicles more like something that the customer owns.

There are reasons that Tesla gives for not doing this but what it needs to understand is that cars simply are not software. They’re cars and people have been accustomed for generations to having control over their own cars. The idea of not having control is not only alien but offensive to most vehicle owners.

Tesla needs to get solidly behind the Right to Repair movement stop abusing the owners of salvage-titled Teslas and provide whatever independent shops owners and anyone else needs to perform their own repairs. Anyone can go to the parts counter at other manufacturers’ dealers and buy a part for a vehicle no questions asked and that’s an industry standard that Tesla should adopt.

I can see why Tesla would want to take a modular approach to vehicle repair and that’s something that it can continue to do. To have every service center digging deep into things like battery packs drive units and complex interior assemblies would add a lot of cost and complexity at the service center level and it makes a lot of sense to avoid that.

To keep repair costs from ballooning out to the costs of whole new assemblies Tesla can take another page out of the “legacy” auto playbook: refurbished and remanufactured parts.

For example when someone comes in with a damaged battery pack Tesla could order in a remanufactured pack instead of demanding the customer buy a new one. Then send that damaged pack to another location where it can have whatever minor internal repair it needs to be ready for the next customer who needs a pack. Instead of paying $16000 for a new pack a customer could pay only a fraction of that for a remanufactured assembly especially when you consider that they’re feeding the whole rest of their pack back into the remanufacturing effort.

The remanufacturing could happen at the factory at a dedicated facility or at a third party remanufacturing company that already does this kind of work and could even be a little profitable for whoever does it.

If Tesla can do all of this or even most of it that would make a huge difference to its customers. Hell I might even buy one!

The man has been in contact with the company but so far it's denying any responsibility.



The new feature is part of a subscription program that came out a little more than a week ago.



The 'smart summon' feature which acts as a personal valet is supposed to self-drive the car right to you from wherever it's parked.

[RELATED]

This was only David Alford's second time using the feature after purchasing the subscription on July 16th.

The car was backed into a parking spot and was supposed to pull forward on its own and veer to the right but instead it unexpectedly went left.

""If you press the button and hold it it’ll follow the blue line in the app and the car will drive out to you"" said Alford.



Alford was showing his 5-year-old son the new feature on Monday July 19th.

""When I pressed the button it told me that it was going to come out and go to the right to me"" said Alford.

But instead ""it ran into the pole on the left side"" said Alford ""It was supposed to go north and it went south.”

Alford is a huge Tesla fan and happens to be a software developer himself.

“I really support the company a lot"" said Alford ""This type of stuff intrigues me I really like it but I just don’t like their response I think they should be a little bit better about their customer service.”

[RELATED]

After the incident he drove straight to the Tesla Service Center in Fresno.

""I explain the situation and then he asked me if I was inside the car while it was operating"" said Alford ""I said no and he said 'well it’s a beta software so pretty much we can’t do anything about it we’re not going to do anything about it.'”

Alford even tried filing a service request.

“I got a response that was to look over driver responsibility in the owner's manual"" said Alford.

And his insurance said they would cover it but only as a collision.

""I don’t really want that on my insurance being that I wasn’t driving the car"" said Alford ""I feel a little helpless I mean it’s fun software you know it’s this new thing that’s happening but it’s too unpredictable to be giving to the public in that stage especially with a 2000-pound car.”

Alford is waiting on a response from Tesla’s legal team as well as an estimate on the damage before taking the matter any further.

He says he absolutely thinks Tesla should cover the cost of the damage and feels let down by a company he really looks up to.

He’s also warning drivers not to use the smart summon feature.

This is not an isolated incident. A quick google search will bring up a number of similar issues from other Tesla owners.

This begs the question is this “beta software"" safe? And should it be accessible to the public?

We have already achieved a number of important milestones and the next few months will feature a great amount of activity as our team prepares the Denali for its inaugural flight. Chris Hearne Senior Vice President Engineering

What are the Technological advances ?

The Denali is powered by GE Aviation’s new advanced Catalyst engine which has completed over 2300 hours of testing and prepping for a first flight on its Beechcraft King Air flying test bed. The Catalyst is a more environmentally friendly engine that burns less fuel than older turboprop technologies. The engine can also use sustainable aviation fuel which results in lower emissions.

The FADEC-equipped 1300 shaft horsepower (SHP)-rated turboprop engine eases pilot workload with its single-lever power and propeller control. The FADEC control of the engine provides trend monitoring which allows for on-condition maintenance with no mid-life Hot Section Inspection required.

The airplane is equipped with McCauley’s new 105-inch diameter composite 5-blade constant speed propeller which is full feathering with reversible pitch and ice protection. The propeller will undergo a series of certification tests and several are already underway.

The Denali cockpit features the Garmin G3000 intuitive avionics suite featuring high-resolution and touchscreen controllers. An integrated Garmin autothrottle is now a standard feature which interfaces with the Automatic Flight Control System (AFCS) and Flight Management System (FMS) to provide easy speed control throughout all regimes of flight from takeoff to touchdown.

Other G3000 features include a 10-inch weather radar Advanced Terrain Awareness Warning Systems (TAWS) and dual transponders with automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) capabilities which are compliant with the latest air traffic control requirements.

What do passengers get ?

The Beechcraft Denali’s flat floor cabin is designed to be the largest in its segment and offers the versatility to easily convert between passenger and cargo configurations. The Denali cabin features a standard seating configuration of six individual reclining seats and offers a nine-place high density seating option.

The aircraft boasts a digital pressurization system maintaining a 6000-foot cabin altitude at a service ceiling of 30000 feet. The Denali also offers passengers the convenience of adjusting the cabin temperature and airflow from a climate-control switch panel located on the cabin sidewall.

Passengers will also enjoy large cabin windows interior LED lighting a forward refreshment cabinet and an in-flight accessible baggage compartment. An optional externally serviceable belted lavatory with pocket door enclosure that is located in the rear of the cabin is also available.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1Z3VzdGFjaHJvbmljbGUuY29tL3N0b3J5L2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMjEvMDcvMjQvYml6LWJyaWVmcy1idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzLWFyb3VuZC1hdWd1c3RhLWFyZWEvODA0MzQ1NDAwMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Biz Briefs: Business news around the Augusta area,"Augusta Chronicle

Both are chemists by profession working as science researchers at UP Diliman.

Corazon Ericka Mae Itang was beyond surprised by her boyfriend’s efforts in asking for her hand last July 22 2021.

Jacob Noel Inguito made the proposal by making her run a synthetic peptide sample at work which later on resulted to a synthesized “MARRYME” peptide.

Peptides are short sequences of amino acids which are compounds that make up a protein. Each letter of the “MARRYME” peptide represents one amino acid:

M – methionine

A – alanine

R – arginine

R – arginine

Y – tyrosine

M – methionine

E – glutamic acid

“Last week one of my labmates (Chay Mendoza) gave me this sample to analyze. This is a normal occurrence in our lab so I had no suspicions whatsoever. Little did I know that this sample will change my life forever.

So I ran the sample in the mass spec and checked its spectrum against all known databases. Kaso wala talaga akong makuhang sequence match. So I did de novo sequencing instead.

(So I ran the sample in the mass spec and checked its spectrum against all known databases. However I could not get a sequence match. So I did de novo sequencing instead.)

Eh kaya naman pala… hahahaha. The sample was a synthetic MARRYME peptide!” she wrote in her post.

(So it’s because it was this…hahahaha. The sample was a synthetic MARRYME peptide!)

Her boyfriend contacted Thermo Fisher Scientific—a US company that makes peptides to synthesize the “MARRYME” sequence peptide.

After learning it was for a wedding proposal the company decided to synthesize the peptide for free.

“So after doing the analysis yesterday I messaged him and said of course I’ll marry you. Pero nasaan ang singsing? Hahaha. Sabi niya may part 2 pa daw ang proposal. So ang tanong ko ano na status namin? Haha” she went on.

(So after doing the analysis yesterday I messaged him and said of course I’ll marry you. But where is the ring? Hahaha. He told me that there is a part 2 to the proposal. So my question is what is our status now?)

Itang was set up to met her bestfriend at a restaurant in Quezon City where her boyfriend finally popped the question himself.

She told CDN Digital in an interview that it was indeed a unique way to propose.

Itang said they had not planned the date and venue of their wedding yet because they still had career plans to pursue.

“I was definitely surprised jud. Like I was just doing my usual routine at work and I didn’t realize nga I was holding a sample for a wedding proposal na diay haha. I agree nga it was a very unique way to propose jud” she said.

(I was really definitely surprised. Like I was just doing my usual routine at work and I didn’t realize that I was already holding a sample for a wedding proposal haha. I agree that it was a very unique way to really propose.)

The new V-1000 is almost 25% more powerful and delivers 33% higher airflow and 67% higher stand-by capacity than the equivalent diesel units offering large truck operators the benefits of advanced vehicle drive technology – low-cost control low weight and compact size.

The V-1000 uses a compressor exclusively developed for Thermo King which when driven by the truck engine produces performance previously unattainable in units of this type.

This positively impacts the total cost of operation when it comes to fuel consumption maintenance costs and productivity making the V-1000 a competitive investment compared to diesel powered unit with equivalent performance.

“Traditionally companies operating larger rigid trucks have looked at self-powered diesel units. This tradition is about to change” said Eneko Fernandez product leader Truck at Thermo King.

“We designed the V-1000 to deliver exceptional performance compete directly and sometimes outperform the self-powered units. High cooling capacity and high airflow of the V-1000 will protect our customers’ load under the most arduous conditions. And it will do so with a significantly lower environmental impact than the diesel-powered solutions – with no CO2 emissions from the unit and lower noise when in operation.”

To ensure voice of the customer was captured during the development of the new solution

Thermo King collaborated with several transport companies across Europe that tested the V-1000 units in real-life operations. One of these companies is Verny a grocery retail chain in Russia.

“For several months we have operated the Thermo King V-1000 units seven days a week delivering products across our different store locations” said Alexander Oleynik head of the transport department at Verny.

“We have been completely satisfied. With a set temperature range of +2 degrees Celsius the unit proved its great capacity to quickly pick up and reliably maintain the desired temperature – an important benefit for our delivery operations with multiple door openings. There were no failures or malfunctions in the unit’s operations.”

For flexible operations the profile of the Thermo King V-1000 makes it suitable for high cabs while the units are also compatible with multiple vehicle types including CNG LNG or Biodiesel. The V-1000 is available in both 12V or 24V options and can fit trucks that range from 3.5 to 25 tonnes to fit customer’s multiple application needs.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Amid several global crises including climate change and a pandemic billionaires are spending their cash on launching themselves into space for fun. When Amazon founder Jeff Bezos told reporters after his first space tourism trip on Tuesday that Amazon customers and employees had “paid” for his flight that only intensified that criticism.

But critics won’t deter Bezos and the other superrich. Space tourism is now a reality for the people who can afford it — and it will have repercussions for everyone on Earth.

In fact all signs indicate that the market for these trips is already big enough that they’ll keep happening. Jeff Bezos’s spaceflight company Blue Origin already has two more trips scheduled later this year while Virgin Galactic the space firm founded by billionaire Richard Branson has at least 600 people who have already paid around $250000 each for future tickets on its spaceplane.

Now as the commercial space tourism market (literally) gets off the ground there are big questions facing future space travelers — and everyone else on the planet. Here are answers to the six biggest ones.

1. What will people actually be able to see and experience on a space trip?

The biggest perk of traveling to space is the view. Just past the boundary between space and Earth passengers can catch a stunning glimpse of our planet juxtaposed against the wide unknown of space. If a passenger is riding on a Virgin Galactic flight they will get about 53 miles above sea level. Blue Origin riders will get a little bit higher about 62 miles above sea level and past the Kármán line the internationally recognized boundary between Earth and space. Overall the experience on both flights is pretty similar.

The view is meant to be awe-inducing and the experience even has its own name: the Overview Effect. “​​When you see Earth from that high up it changes your perspective on things and how interconnected we are and how we squander that here on Earth” Wendy Whitman Cobb a professor at the US Air Force’s School of Advanced Air and Space Studies told Recode.

Another perk of these trips is that space tourists will feel a few minutes of microgravity which is when gravity feels extremely weak. That will give them the chance to bounce around a spacecraft weightlessly before heading back to Earth.

But Blue Origin’s and Virgin Galactic’s flights are relatively brief — about 10 and 90 minutes long respectively. Other space tourism flights from SpaceX the space company founded by Elon Musk will have more to offer. This fall billionaire Jared Isaacman who founded the company Shift4 Payments will pilot SpaceX’s first all-civilian flight the Inspiration4 which will spend several days in orbit around Earth. In the coming years the company has also planned private missions to the International Space Station as well as a trip around the moon.

These trips are meant to be enjoyed by space nerds who longed to be astronauts. But there’s another reason rich people want to go to space: demonstrating exclusivity and conspicuous consumption. More than a few people can afford a trip to Venice or the Maldives. But how many people are privileged enough to take a trip to space?

“What a nice way of showing off these days than to post a picture on Instagram from space” Sridhar Tayur a Carnegie Mellon business professor told Recode.

2. Does commercial space travel have any scientific goals or is it really just a joyride?

Right now space tourism flights from Virgin Galactic and Blue Origin have only reached suborbital space which means that flights enter space but do not enter orbit around Earth. Scientifically that’s not a new frontier. Though these current flights use new technology suborbital flight with humans aboard was accomplished by NASA back in the early 1960s Matthew Hersch a historian of technology at Harvard told Recode.

Right now it’s not clear these trips will offer scientists major new insights but they might provide information that could be used in the future for space exploration. In fact these trips are also being marketed as potential opportunities for scientific experiments. For instance the most recent Virgin Galactic flight carried plants and tested how they responded to microgravity.

These private companies primarily see opportunities in their commercial vehicles that can be reused at scale which will allow the same rockets (or in Virgin Galactic’s case spaceplanes) to go to space again and again which lowers the overall cost of space tourism.

Billionaires and their private space companies also see the development of these rockets as an opportunity to prepare for flights that will do even more and go even farther into space. Bezos for instance has argued that New Shepard’s suborbital flights will help prepare the company’s future missions including its New Glenn rocket which is meant for orbital space.

“The fact of the matter is the architecture and the technology we have chosen is complete overkill for a suborbital tourism mission” Bezos said at Tuesday’s post-launch briefing. “We have chosen the vertical landing architecture. Why did we do that? Because it scales.”

Beyond potential scientific advancements in the future suborbital spaceflight might also create new ways to travel from one place on earth to another. SpaceX for instance has advertised that long-haul flights could be shortened to just 30 minutes by traveling through space.

3. Is it safe?

Right now it’s not entirely clear just how risky space tourism is.

One way space tourism companies are trying to keep travelers safe is by requiring training so that the people who are taking a brief sojourn off Earth are as prepared as possible.

On the flight people can experience intense altitude and G-forces. “This is sustained G-forces on your body upwards of what can be 6 G in one direction — which is six times your body weight for upwards of 20 or 30 seconds” Glenn King the chief operating officer of the Nastar Center — the aerospace physiology training center that prepared Richard Branson for his flights — told Recode. “That’s a long time when you have six people or your weight pressing down on you.”

There’s also the chance that space tourists will be exposed to radiation though that risk depends on how long you’re in space. “It’s a risk especially more for the orbital flight than sub-orbital” explains Whitman Cobb. “Going up in an airplane exposes you to a higher amount of radiation than you would get here on the ground.” She also warns that some tourists will likely barf on the ride.

There doesn’t seem to be an age limit on who can travel though. The most recent Blue Origin flight included both the youngest person to ever travel to space an 18-year-old Dutch teenager as well as the oldest: 82-year-old pilot Wally Funk.

4. How much will tickets cost?

The leaders in commercial space tourism already claim they have a market to support the industry. While Bezos hinted on Tuesday the price would eventually come down — as eventually happened with the high prices of the nascent airline industry — for now ticket prices are in the low hundreds of thousands at least for Virgin Galactic. That price point would keep spaceflight out of reach for most of humanity but there are enough interested rich people that space tourism seems to be economically feasible.

“If you bring it down to $250000 the wait times [to buy a ticket] will be very long” Tayur of Carnegie Mellon told Recode.

5. What impact will commercial space travel have on the environment?

The emissions of a flight to space can be worse than those of a typical airplane flight because just a few people hop aboard one of these flights so the emissions per passenger are much higher. That pollution could become much worse if space tourism becomes more popular. Virgin Galactic alone eventually aims to launch 400 of these flights annually.

“The carbon footprint of launching yourself into space in one of these rockets is incredibly high close to about 100 times higher than if you took a long-haul flight” Eloise Marais a physical geography professor at the University College London told Recode. “It’s incredibly problematic if we want to be environmentally conscious and consider our carbon footprint.”

These flights’ effects on the environment will differ depending on factors like the fuel they use the energy required to manufacture that fuel and where they’re headed — and all these factors make it difficult to model their environmental impact. For instance Jeff Bezos has argued that the liquid hydrogen and oxygen fuel Blue Origin uses is less damaging to the environment than the other space competitors (technically his flight didn’t release carbon dioxide) but experts told Recode it could still have significant environmental effects.

There are also other risks we need to keep studying including the release of soot that could hurt the stratosphere and the ozone. A study from 2010 found that the soot released by 1000 space tourism flights could warm Antarctica by nearly 1 degree Celsius. “There are some risks that are unknown” Paul Peeters a tourism sustainability professor at the Breda University of Applied Sciences told Recode. “We should do much more work to assess those risks and make sure that they do not occur or to alleviate them somehow — before you start this space tourism business.” Overall he thinks the environmental costs are reason enough not to take such a trip.

6. Who is regulating commercial space travel?

Right now the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has generally been given the job of overseeing the commercial space industry. But regulation of space is still relatively meager.

One of the biggest areas of concern is licensing launches and making sure that space flights don’t end up hitting all the other flying vehicles humans launch into the sky like planes and drones. Just this June a SpaceX flight was held up after a helicopter flew into the zone of the launch.

There’s a lot that still needs to be worked out especially as there are more of these launches. On Thursday the Senate hosted a hearing with leaders of the commercial space industry focused on overseeing the growing amount of civil space traffic.

At the same time the FAA is also overseeing a surging number of spaceports — essentially airports for spaceflight — and making sure there’s enough space for them to safely set up their launches.

But there are other areas where the government could step in. “I think the cybersecurity aspect will also play a very vital role so that people don’t get hacked” Tayur said. The FAA told Recode that the agency has participated in developing national principles for space cybersecurity but Congress hasn’t given it a specific role in looking at the cybersecurity of space.

At some point the government might also step in to regulate the environmental impact of these flights too but that’s not something the FAA currently has jurisdiction over.

In the meantime no government agency is currently vetting these companies when it comes to the safety of the human passengers aboard. An FAA official confirmed with Recode that while the agency is awarding licenses to companies to carry humans to space they’re not actually confirming that these trips are safe. That’s jurisdiction Congress won’t give the agency until 2023.

There doesn’t seem to be an abundance of travelers’ insurance policies for space. “Passengers basically sign that they’re waiving all their rights” Whitman Cobb said. “You’re acknowledging that risk and doing it yourself right now.”

So fair warning if you decide to shell out hundreds of thousands of dollars for a joyride to space: You’d likely have to accept all responsibility if you get hurt.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vbGVpc3VyZS10cmF2ZWwtY29taW5nLWJhY2stZXhwZXJ0cy1idXNpbmVzcy10cmF2ZWwtcmVjb3ZlcnkteWVhcnMtb3V0LTIwMjEtN9IBcGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vbGVpc3VyZS10cmF2ZWwtY29taW5nLWJhY2stZXhwZXJ0cy1idXNpbmVzcy10cmF2ZWwtcmVjb3ZlcnkteWVhcnMtb3V0LTIwMjEtNz9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Leisure travel coming back but experts say business travel recovery is years out,"A TSA officer wears a mask at Logan International Airport in Boston in March 2020.

It's not just airlines: The slow and steady increase in business travel is also impacting hotels.

From June 21 to June 24 (a Monday through Thursday when business travel typically happens) the revenue per available room for generic business travel hotels was down about 45% compared to the same time in 2019. Meanwhile mid-week stays at economy hotels – like Super 8 which primarily caters to leisure travelers – were up almost 10%.







Luckily the increasingly blurred line between business and leisure travel has ""helped cushion the blow"" Scholes said. But even this won't ""ever fully account for that Wednesday night business travel.""

A new McKinsey & Co. report Hainan’s 40 Billion Prize: The new battleground for global luxury predicts that the tropical destination’s duty-free retailing sector will continue to grow post-pandemic with 62 percent of surveyed Hainan travelers stating they are likely to return to the island even after overseas travel is normalized. The Hainan Provincial Government’s 14th Five-Year Plan estimates the island’s duty-free market will grow tenfold between 2020 and 2025 to 46.5 billion and become one of the world’s largest travel retail locations — thanks to favorable regulations increased investments from big local players and competitive price offerings.

The Jing Take

In 2020 beauty accounted for half of all Hainan’s duty-free sales; however as more brands have opened stores in the tax-free retail hub consumers have been diversifying their spending there. The report also states that one in three visitors intend to make a fashion purchase on their next trip. But is this good or bad news for global luxury brands? Admittedly Hainan’s duty-free destination can provide businesses ultra-efficient sales to high volume bargain shoppers but heritage houses may run the risk of damaging their brand equity hurting their price positioning and lastly harming their direct customer relationships.

Still Hainan offers a huge opportunity for luxury Maisons and very few can avoid the allure of its strong growth potential. However to prevent diluting brand values companies should review their merchandise allocation as well as avoid stocking an abundance of their signature pieces. They should also unify their Hainan Island and mainland consumer databases to enable local stores to retarget Hainan travelers after returning to their hometowns. Meanwhile the report held strong on the importance of Hainan’s beauty market stressing that brands should fully embrace this lucrative category without any fears of weakening their brand image.

Back in May SpaceX launched its Starship SN15 prototype to about the cruising altitude of a commercial airliner before landing it safely. The company claims future versions of the rocket will be able to take 100 passengers at a time to the moon and even Mars.

But while it's one thing to send a rocket to Mars it's another to send people there alive. And it's yet another thing to make sure the people can be as healthy as they were when they left Earth.

Besides packing enough fuel and air and water and food for the seven-month-long journey to Mars (and more for a return trip if you want a return ticket) there are other luxuries we enjoy here on Earth that the spaceship will have to provide if we want to stay healthy during the long flight.

Nasty sunburns and zero gravity

Earth's atmosphere and magnetic field protect us from harmful space radiation but passengers bound for Mars will lose that protection. So their spaceship would need to provide some kind of radiation shielding.

Depending on where radiation comes from it may be made of different particles and have different energies which would require different means of shielding and pose different levels of danger to our radiation-prone DNA. For example radiations from energetic particles ejected from the sun behave very differently than cosmic rays from outside our galaxy.

So how many times more radiation would a Mars-bound astronaut experience compared to what they would experience on Earth?

Enough to be of concern according to Athanasios Petridis a physicist from Drake University in Des Moines. According to calculations by his team high-end estimates for radiation exposure during a round trip to Mars are in the range of several Sieverts (Sv). For reference the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission has set 0.05 Sv/year as the dose limit for workers who are exposed to radiation at their jobs.

Solar weather also plays a role in the amount of radiation you would get in space. For instance the 11-year solar cycle affects the amount of radiation the sun emits. However due to the complicated interplay between sun-generated radiation and cosmic rays from outer space it may not be worth it to time the launch around these cycles.

""There are enough competing factors in radiation exposure that trying to plan around the solar cycle is like trying to time the stock market which usually results in losing"" said Kerry Lee a radiation analyst from NASA in Houston.

The lack of gravity can also wreak havoc on the human body given enough time. Astronauts aboard space stations have been shown to lose 1 to 1.5% of the mineral density in their weight-bearing bones every month. They also tend to lose muscle mass even when exercising as much as they do on Earth.

""There are plenty of risks associated with space flight. I don't think these are deal breakers for missions to Mars"" said Lee. ""[NASA has] had several crew members do missions approaching a year in space. Also there are countermeasures in place that have been proven to slow and stop the loss of muscle mass and bone density while in space.""

An undergraduate team of researchers from Drake University with the project name of Magneto-Ionization Spacecraft Shield for Interplanetary Travel or MISSFIT is trying to calculate the tradeoffs among different engineering solutions for radiation shielding and artificial gravity.

""Say if you want to create artificial gravity through rotation you may want to make the radius of the spacecraft as large as you can but the bigger the radius the bigger the magnetic field you will need for radiation shielding"" said Petridis the project leader for MISSFIT. ""There's always a tradeoff.""

The project aims to give undergraduate physics students valuable experience conducting original research. ""We try to make it a very exciting project and anything related to space travel is exciting"" Petridis said.

Carousel floors and radiation shields

Without any mind-blowing sci-fi level breakthroughs the only practical way to imitate gravity on a trip to Mars is by spinning the spacecraft and creating a centripetal force. (You could theoretically accelerate the spacecraft to mimic gravity but that would mean throttling the rocket to provide the G-force before braking once past the middle point -- a completely impractical approach given the fuel requirement.)

For the centripetal approach the larger the spin radius -- perhaps in the shape of a hoop -- the closer it would resemble the feel of the gravity on Earth. But it would also be more difficult to launch and may require assembly in space.

It will also be more difficult to provide enough radiation shielding for the larger structure.

""I mean you can wrap the whole spacecraft in lead if you want to but it's gonna be really heavy and completely impractical"" said Keegan Finger an undergraduate physics major from Drake University. ""That's why we are looking at magnetic shielding -- to try to save on weight.""

Finger and his classmates discussed their progress on the project at the April 2021 meeting of the American Physical Society held virtually this year due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

""We are working on calculating the energy requirements for the different kinds of magnetic shielding. We are also looking at different configurations of the magnetic field rather than the standard two dipole system"" said Petridis. The shape of the magnetic shield may be tailored to better suit the living quarter configuration aboard the spacecraft.

""We also need to consider what levels of radiation at what specific energies we need to shield from"" said Will Thomas another physics undergrad working for the project. For example what combination of physical shields bodysuits and magnetic field can best guard the astronauts from the different kinds of radiation in space.

The project is expanding to include biology majors to consider the effect of imitated gravity on the human body. The goal is to find a combination of strategies that can best minimize the overall health risk posed by deep space travel.

There can be subtle differences in the different ways of imitating gravity for instance regarding the intricate physics of our cardiovascular system.

""For example what effects do the gradient of gravity and the Coriolis force have on blood flow?"" said Petridis. ""Look we can handle the math and the computations but as physicists we have no idea how the cardiovascular system works so we need this to be an interdisciplinary collaboration. Because that's what real-world problems are they are interdisciplinary.""

But with nearly 49% of the country fully vaccinated travel is making a big comeback — even with the fast-spreading delta variant.

If you're ready to travel The Points Guy (TPG) has released its annual report on the best U.S. airlines for 2021.

To determine the list the website ranked each airline in four categories using data from the Department of Transportation. Those factors include reliability (including timeliness cancellations and baggage); experience (cabin features lounges and customer complaints); cost (including bag and change fees) and loyalty (frequent flyer usage and award availability).

For the third straight year in a row TPG ranked Delta Air Lines No. 1 according to the report.

""The carrier wasn't a standout in any single category — it was fifth for mishandled baggage and fourth for customer complaints submitted to the DOT for example"" the report said. ""However Delta only hit the bottom spot in a single element (affordability) otherwise maintaining solid scores across the remaining data-backed criteria we analyzed. This consistency helped push it to the top spot.""

Here are the 10 best U.S. airlines according to TPG's report and their highest and lowest performing areas:

1. Delta Air Lines

Top-performing areas: involuntary bumps from flights lounges

Lowest-performing areas: affordability

2. Southwest Airlines

Top-performing areas: customer satisfaction bag/change fees award availability

Lowest-performing areas: lounges

(A Southwest spokesperson says it's honored to make the list during one of the toughest years in the airline's history and credits the Southwest employees for its success.)

3. United Airlines

Photo by Grace Elletson/VTDigger

When Burlington residents received their new property reappraisals in the mail this past April many were shocked at how high their home values had climbed and immediately began worrying about sky-high property taxes.

They were met with reassurances by city officials — the city charter dictates that reappraisals have to be revenue-neutral meaning that the overall pot of money the city takes in from property taxes can’t grow much bigger when property values go up.

Burlington Mayor Miro Weinberger told residents that their tax bills would not be rising at the same rate as their home valuations — which had not been reappraised since 2005. “We’ll work hard throughout the process to ensure that people do feel fairly treated” he told VTDigger in April.

Now as tax bills are being delivered across the city some are seeing higher increases than they expected. While tax bills may not have shot up in proportion to their home value increases some residents say their bills have swelled thousands of dollars and are questioning how this could happen in a “revenue-neutral” reappraisal system. Some say they’re worried about the long-term affordability of the city they call home.

Burlington resident Todd DeLuca said his property taxes are going up about 20% adding thousands of dollars to his annual bill.

“I was shocked” DeLuca said. “Not only because I was going to have to pay so much more money but because so many of us have had a tough year financially.”

But taxes didn’t go up on every property in the city. Rather the tax burden shifted more onto properties whose value increased.

According to City Assessor John Vickery and a VTDigger analysis of the 2021 and 2022 property values in Burlington more of the tax burden has shifted onto homeowners as residential property values increased at a higher rate than for commercial properties. Single-family homeowners face an average increase of 11% in their tax bills while the bills for commercial properties dropped 4% on average.

The redistribution of taxes in part reflects valuations affected by the Covid-19 pandemic which forced mass business and office closures and drove home-buying through the roof as interest rates plummeted and the housing supply became even more scarce.

Tax burden redistributed to homeowners

In VTDigger’s analysis of the city’s 2022 and 2021 property grand lists out of about 10600 properties appraised in the city property taxes went up on 8000.

VTDigger found that tax increases averaged $1875 for properties whose bills went up. For properties whose tax bills decline the average decrease was $2125.

For the roughly 9040 single-family homes in the city property tax bills went up an average of $960. On average the value of a single-family home went up 56%. The median value — the midpoint on the list of property values — of a single-family home rose from $236000 in 2021 to $376000 in 2022 a 59% jump.

For the 767 commercial properties in the city value went up an average of about 30% but the tax bill declined by about 4%.

Property-tax bills for single-family homes — the largest class of properties in Burlington — went up about 11%.

Commercial properties in Burlington are taxed at a higher rate than residential properties. The appraised values of commercial properties are multiplied by a rate of 1.2 — a practice that Vickery said began in the 1980s to lift more of the tax burden off residents.

While the reappraisal boosted the total value of Burlington’s taxable property from about $3.8 billion to $5.5 billion Vickery said the city’s total property tax collections will be about the same as in the past because the city charter dictates that reappraisals remain revenue-neutral.

But though the total is the same “the burden is moving toward the single-family home” Vickery said.

“The purpose of the reappraisal is to reset the tax burden because over time some properties have advantage and others are subsidizing those that don’t” Vickery said.

The reappraisal attempts to equalize the tax burden he said. But to those whose bills rise Vickery said “It’s not fun.”

State law obligated Burlington to complete a citywide property reappraisal in 2019 when the project began. That’s because the city’s common level of appraisal fell below 80% of fair market value — the threshold the Vermont Department of Taxes uses to determine if a municipal reappraisal needs to be conducted.

Samantha Sheehan spokesperson for the mayor said in an email to VTDigger that the recent reappraisal is required by state law to make the city’s tax system more equitable. She said property owners who believe their assessment wasn’t fair are welcome to appeal.

“The mayor has long-believed that Burlingtonians pay too much in property taxes relative to residents of other cities and he has worked hard for a decade to keep the cumulative increase in the municipal tax rate well under the rate of inflation for that period even while he has made dramatic new infrastructure investments and expansions in city services” Sheehan said.

“These prudent efforts include keeping the municipal rate 3.5% below voter-authorized caps this year and deploying $6 million of federal [American Rescue Plan] investment in the general fund to balance the FY’22 budget instead of raising revenues through increased local fees and taxes.”

Residents cast doubt on fairness

DeLuca whose property taxes jumped about 20% questioned how middle-class residents will be able to afford the sudden increase in their tax bills.

“The public policy nerd in me is stunned that someone in city government thinks it’s a good idea to increase people’s taxes that much in one year” he said.

He also questioned the criteria that Tyler Technologies the company commissioned by the city to conduct the reappraisal used to ensure that its work was fair.

DeLuca noticed that a neighbor’s house was appraised for less than his yet has 2000 more square feet. That neighbor’s home was determined to be in “average” condition while DeLuca’s was determined to be in “very good” condition. He said he hadn’t received any explanation about why his house was labeled that way and has questions about the subjectivity of the criteria.

Another resident who spoke with VTDigger anonymously for the sake of financial privacy said the property tax bill was about $7800 last year but will jump nearly $3000 this year to about $10600.

“It was certainly concerning” they said of the increase. “Especially when you buy a home plan and budget everything out that kind of increase is not something that could be anticipated.”

They noticed that a large jump in value came from the land. Their house is in the New North End where a three-quarter-acre lot carries a good amount of value. But their land is primarily an unusable cliff side leading to the intervale — a key characteristic that they think Tyler Technology missed because most of the reappraisal process took place remotely without home visits due to the pandemic.

They appealed their property valuation with Tyler Technologies but received a letter a few weeks later with the same home value attached.

Vickery said that of the 10689 properties appraised by the city about 2000 or 18% were appealed. He said the city does not yet have exact figures on how many valuations changed after the appeal but as more cases are heading to the city’s board of tax appeals he estimates that 50% will change the valuations.

Vickery said Tyler Technologies used airplanes to take photos of Burlington properties drove cars up and down every city street to map the condition of homes and pulled permit histories to assess when and how much work had been done on a property which helped to inform whether a home would be designated as “fair” “average” or “good” condition.

He said there can be mistakes when factoring a property’s valuation which is why there’s an appeals process. The deadline to appeal a property valuation for this fiscal year is closed but he said homeowners have the opportunity to appeal next year.

For those worried about being able to pay their property taxes Vickery pointed to the state’s income-eligible property tax credit program which he said 70% of homeowners qualify for. If homeowners make under $138500 a year and their home qualifies as their primary residence they may be eligible for a property tax credit.

Vickery said he thought the reappraisal process was “as fair as it gets.” He said the assessor’s office has been double-checking Tyler Technology’s work and the state also audits a reappraisal after its completion to ensure that it was conducted fairly.

“I’m confident that overall” Vickery said “we meet measures of fairness and equity.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Then when she complained about the sexual harassment and assault officials at Tyson retaliated against her and fired her the lawsuit alleges.

The worker who lives in Wilkes County is seeking more than $5 million in compensatory and punitive damages. The Winston-Salem Journal typically does not identify alleged victims of sexual assault. No criminal charges have been filed in the case. The lawsuit alleges battery assault intentional infliction of emotional distress wrongful discharge from employment in violation of policy and several other claims.

Harvey and Harold Kennedy the attorneys representing the woman filed the lawsuit July 15 in Forsyth Superior Court. Named as defendants in the lawsuit are Tyson Foods Inc. James R. Cooper III of Winston-Salem Roosevelt Kelly and Christine Harris. Kelly and Harris live in Wilkes County according to the lawsuit.

Tyson Foods is one of the world’s largest food companies and has chicken-processing facilities in Wilkesboro where it employs about 3000 people.

Kelly Hellbusch a spokeswoman for Tyson Foods said in an email Monday afternoon that company officials do not comment on pending litigation. When reached Monday morning Harris said “I do not have any comment on that at this time.”

The Winston-Salem Journal called a phone number associated with Cooper’s address on Monday. Later that afternoon Cooper called a Winston-Salem Journal reporter confirming that he was the same Cooper who worked at Tyson’s Food. After learning about the allegations contained in the lawsuit Cooper hung up without any comment. Cooper called from an anonymous number.

Efforts to contact Kelly were unsuccessful.

According to the lawsuit the woman started working at Tyson Foods Inc. in December 2018. She worked at the company’s Fresh Plant in Wilkesboro in a department known as the 28 Degree Room. Cooper was the department’s manager.

The lawsuit alleges that Cooper constantly asked the woman to have sex with him sometimes two to three times on the night shift.

“His sexual propositioning of the Plaintiff occurred on the job inside of the company’s plant” the lawsuit said. “Plaintiff rebuffed his sexual advances. She would turn and walk away from him but he would follow her.”

In October 2020 the woman was working her shift when Cooper came over and asked her when she was going to have sex with him.

“Suddenly he pulled his penis out of his pants and completely exposed himself to (the woman)” the lawsuit said. The complaint alleges that Cooper grabbed the woman’s right hand and tried to force her to touch his penis. The woman told him to stop and she jerked away. Then the lawsuit said she walked quickly away.

After that incident the lawsuit said Cooper began yelling at her and verbally abusing her on a daily basis.

The woman reported the sexual assault and sexual harassment to Harris who was the plant’s human resources manager. Harris the lawsuit said retaliated against her. The lawsuit alleges that after the woman made her report Harris called for Kelly on the loudspeaker to come to her office. Afterward Kelly gave the woman a disciplinary write-up even though Kelly was not her manager.

When the woman confronted Harris the lawsuit said Harris acknowledged that she had ordered Kelly to write the woman up.

The lawsuit alleges that Cooper and Kelly a manager in another department were close friends and that Kelly also verbally abused the woman. After the alleged sexual assault by Cooper Kelly came to the 28 Degree Room to harass the woman it said.

She was fired on Oct. 28 2020 the lawsuit said.

After the firing Cooper met with employees under his supervision and told everyone that the woman had filed a complaint against him for sexual harassment and sexual assault and that “he expected every employee under his supervision to back him up in any company investigation.”

“This was an implicit threat to every employee under his supervision that they could be fired if they did not back him up” the lawsuit alleges.

The lawsuit said Tyson Foods Inc. had previously fired Cooper for sexual misconduct on the job with a female employee. Because of this prior termination the lawsuit argues that Cooper should never have been hired back at the company.

The lawsuit is seeking $5.35 million in compensatory and punitive damages. A trial date for the lawsuit has not been set.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVobi5vcmcvaGlzdG9yeS1vZi1wb2xsdXRpb24tMjY1MzkxMTkwMC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A toxic travelogue - EHN,"Tis' the season for summer travel — let's take a look at four U.S. stops steeped in history and lingering pollution.

Summitville gold The first gold rush in Summitville Colorado happened just after the Civil War when claim jumpers overran a mountainside that belonged by treaty (and history) to the Southern Utes. A new treaty in 1872 awarded the tribe $25000 a year in perpetuity for the land. Fast-forward to the 1980's when ""advanced"" mining techniques wrung millions more in gold out of the mountain. The advancements involve applying a cyanide solution to rocks to leach out flakes of gold and other metals. The runoff already naturally acidic became downright toxic with cadmium lead and other metals joining the flow. Summitville became unique even among Superfund sites even sporting a visitors' center for the cadmium-curious. The Rio Grande County government which is in the process of taking over the site with the state of Colorado from the Environmental Protection Agency has periodically sponsored public tours of the 1100 acre site. Treating Summitville's toxic runoff will cost $2 million a year probably for decades.

Ducktown and Copperhill Tennessee Ducktown Tennessee. (Credit: Jimmy Emerson DVM/flickr) If you're in need of a real-life parable for an Environmental Damage 101 class few places could beat Ducktown Copperhill and Tennessee's Copper Basin. Copper deposits were found there in the 1840's and by the Civil War the basin became an industrial powerhouse for the Confederacy. Surrounded by miles of hardwood forest in every direction the Copper Basin was the perfect kitchen for cooking an environmental disaster. The forests became fuel for purifying the copper ore burning off sulfur in a giant smelter. The sulfur burned into the denuded hillsides creating an acid rain nightmare made worse by the burning timber. The barren red hills looked like the surface of Mars. The last mine played out in 1987. The Copper Basin is just recovering today.

Hudson hobbled Fishing on the Hudson River. (Credit: John C. Chu/flickr) New York's rise to one of the world's great cities was largely due to one of the world's great rivers. The Hudson River and its estuary forms one of the world's great seaports. And in the 18th and 19th Centuries a great and growing city needed a convenient place to take out its trash and flush its metropolitan toilet: the Hudson was there. Before its most neglected days the Hudson was a beautiful example of fecundity – a dirty-sounding word that actually refers to abundance. Writers like Mark Kurlansky have written that Native Americans and early white settlers thrived on wildlife and sea life like oysters which had shells nearly a foot long. But the wildlife dwindled as the human population and its sewage and garbage grew the Hudson became an eyesore (and I suppose a nose-sore). So appalling were the Hudson and other urban waterways at the end of the 19th Century that Congress passed The Refuse Act in 1899 widely recognized as the nation's first anti-water pollution law. Subsequent laws tightened the regulatory net culminating in the Clean Water Act of 1972. President Richard Nixon is widely credited with signing the sweeping legislation. Except that he didn't. Nixon is profusely thanked for founding the EPA and NOAA and signing the Endangered Species Act the Clean Air Act and more but he actually vetoed the CWA as too costly. A Congress with bipartisan concern for environmental oversight overrode his veto. The Hudson has cleaned up relatively well. But nearly the entire riverbed is tainted with carcinogenic PCB's dumped for decades by two General Electric factories far upstream. Fines litigation and cleanup attempts have failed to cleanse the Hudson. Much of its still-formidable bounty is off limits for human consumption.

A Cold War birthplace A tour of Hanford's B Reactor control room. (Credit: Jeff Keyzer/flickr) In 1942 the U.S. was scrambling to beat Nazi Germany in developing nuclear weapons. Lt. Gen. Leslie Groves a fierce engineer scouted sites for the top-secret Manhattan Project. Washington State's High Desert was a prime choice for America's first plutonium factory. Two small farming towns White Bluffs and Hanford were bought out and the Hanford Works rose on 586 square miles along the Columbia River. Three small cities – Pasco Kennewick and Richland — were built from scratch to serve and house the complex. Hanford made the plutonium for tens of thousands of U.S. warheads and beneath the cloak of Cold War secrecy they made a colossal chemical and radioactive mess that went mostly unnoticed until the 1980's. The end of the Cold War made Hanford's original purpose obsolete but created a new mission: cleaning itself up. Hanford's Tri-Cities became the hottest real estate market in the country for a time in the mid-1990's. Cleanup costs will be in the low billions every year until at least the 2060's. And pending temporary COVID-19 closures the former Hanford site will soon re-open for tours as part of the Manhattan Project National Historic Park administered by the National Park Service.

In this post I'll explain why your FICO score is so important how it's calculated and how you can learn what it is by taking advantage of the rapidly expanding list of credit cards that will tell you your score for free.

Your FICO score is instrumental in how financial institutions view your creditworthiness.

What are the different kinds of credit scores?

While there was originally only one FICO score companies have developed different ways to measure your creditworthiness as time has passed. These include the FICO score 8 or 9 as well as the VantageScore 3.0 and 4.0.

There are several differences between the two methods. The FICO scores 8 and 9 offer slightly different scores for each of the three major credit bureaus while VantageScore offers a single number for all three bureaus. Other differences include importance given to bills sent to collection credit utilization and hard inquiries.

Importance of the FICO credit score

Your FICO score (a product of the Fair Isaac Corporation) is the foundation of most financial transactions you make. If you want a loan at competitive interest rates be approved for a credit card or pass a background check you need to have an acceptable FICO score. Knowing your score can help you anticipate what to expect from these kinds of transactions.

Your FICO score isn't static. It evolves with your finances and you can improve (or damage) it depending on your degree of fiscal responsibility. That's important because it means you can cultivate a high score over time with good financial habits even if you have bad credit (or no credit). Your FICO score allows you to track the state of your finances and can alert you to any problems such as a missed payment or identity theft.

Knowing your FICO score is helpful when it comes to travel rewards because it can give you a sense of which credit cards you're likely to be approved for allowing you to maximize your applications.

The FICO formula is kept private but we know the factors that affect your score. (Image courtesy of Shutterstock)

How your FICO score is determined

TPG has written previously about how your FICO score is compiled; here's a brief refresher:

35% payment history

30% amounts owed

15% length of credit history

10% new credit

10% types of credit

The factors that affect your score the most are late or missed payments and your credit utilization — also known as the ratio of how much credit you're using to how much credit is available to you.

Length of credit history also affects your score so it makes sense to keep your oldest accounts open unless you have a compelling reason to close them. Negative ""remarks"" (like a late payment or accounts in collections) stay on your credit report for seven years. That's a long time to pay for a mistake and have it be an obstacle to earning points and miles. Fortunately negative remarks affect your score less and less as they age.

Credit cards that show your score

The good news is that accessing your FICO score for free is now easier than ever thanks in large part to the FICO Score Open Access Program launched by the Fair Isaac Corporation. This program allows credit card issuers that have already purchased the FICO information to share it with customers at no additional charge.

The following credit card issuers now offer your FICO score for free either online or with your monthly statement.

For those that think their luck’s against them never say never. A Maryland Uber Eats driver and mother of five is sitting pretty after buying a scratch-off lottery ticket for $250000 a few weeks ago.

The winner going by “Grateful Mom” to remain anonymous was sitting in her car waiting for her next delivery when she realized she scratched off the winning ticket.

“Man I was sitting in that car going crazy!” the winner detailed to the Maryland Lottery. “I checked it with my app and saw it was for $250000.”

Within seconds of her realization the Uber Eats app buzzed.

“I said ‘I don’t want to do Uber Eats right now!’” she exclaimed.

‘Grateful Mom’ 47 won the prize through a single play of the “CASH” scratch-off game a $10 ticket with a top prize of $250000.

According to the story from the Maryland Lottery the Anne Arundel County resident is a frequent player of other scratch-offs but typically limits her ticket purchasing to two or three instant tickets in a row often playing in between Uber Eats deliveries.

In this particular case things were slightly different.

“Grateful Mom” made a stop at Quick Save Mart and used the Maryland Lottery app to see her chances of winning on other types of tickets – that’s when the $10 “CASH” game caught her eye. She used other low-dollar winning tickets to cash out and purchase the $250000 scratch-off.

That is the primary word every woman has in her head when she walks out of her front door every day.

How safe am I? How can my safety be endangered? Is anyone following me? How can I be safer?

Tragically Samantha Josephson will never be able to ask herself those questions again as the University of South Caroline student was murdered allegedly by the driver of a car she mistook for her Uber in the early hours of Friday March 29 2019.

The murder trial against a South Carolina man named Nathaniel David Rowland 27 began last week. He is accused of kidnapping and killing the college senior who accidentally got into his car  thinking it was her Uber.

What happened to Samantha Josephson?

Josephson was a 21-year-old political science major who was just a few weeks away from graduating from USC with a full scholarship to Drexel Law School when tragedy struck.

Her boyfriend Greg Corbishley testified that she had been out at a bar she regularly frequented with some friends to celebrate her law school admission.

“I told her to get her mind off of it to go out with her friends that she just worked so hard got into law school that she deserved to have a night to celebrate that” Corbishley said. “I just told her to go out and have fun that night.”

Surveillance video from that night shows a black 2017 Chevrolet Impala circling the block as Josephson waited for an Uber she'd called to take her home.

The USC student and New Jersey native did as many of us do something to help keep her safe while using the driving service; she shared her location with her boyfriend and roommate so they could make sure she got home safely.

Corbishley and Josephson's roommate say they both tracked her route home via her cellphone on the Find My Friends app they all shared. Sadly this did not save Josephson.

Her boyfriend told the court that he watched in real-time as the vehicle she was in headed ""in the complete opposite direction"" of her home. When he noticed this error he tried texting but got no read receipt. When he tried calling it went straight to voicemail.

Her location soon stopped being share with him which Corbishley said ""never happened before in our relationship.""

Thinking she'd maybe left her phone in the Uber he tried calling her roommates to see if she'd made it back safely. They also hadn't heard from her. He went to sleep at 5:00 am still not knowing what had happened to her.

The next day Josephson still hadn't been located and her roommate found an email on Josephon's computer saying the Uber ride had been cancelled.

Josephson was later found dead by hunters in a remote area approximately 65 miles away from where she had gotten into the black sedan and just two miles from Rowland's family home. She had been stabbed multiple times with as many ""as 100 stab wounds scratches and other wounds"" found on her body.

Rowland was arrested after his vehicle was spotted that Saturday. Body cam footage shows he ran from police as soon as the officer began explaining that his car matched the description of a vehicle they were looking for. He was detained a few blocks over by another officer.

Investigators found a large amount of Josephson’s blood as well as samples of her hair and fingerprints was found in the car’s trunk and passenger area.

The vehicle also contained her cell phone a container of liquid bleach germicidal wipes and window cleaner. Additionally the car's child safety locks were activated which police officers believe was intended to prevent her from escaping.

Prosecutors claim they have video evidence that shows Rowland trying to use Josephson’s debit card multiple times including an attempt to use it to withdraw money from her bank account as well trying to sell her phone.

Additionally Rowland's then-girlfriend testified that she saw blood in his car hours after Josephson disappeared adding that she also later saw him cleaning the car with bleach as well as cleaning a hunting knife.

Bed sheets clothing and ""a multitool with knife blades all containing blood"" were found in the trash bin outside of that woman's apartment shortly after Josephson was found dead.

Rowland has maintained that he is innocent with his defense attorney Alicia Goode noting that Rowland’s DNA wasn’t found under Josephson’s fingernails or on her body.

Goode also stated that ""an investigator photographed Rowland within 24 hours after his arrest and his skin showed no marks or cuts that would have been consistent with Josephson having fought him.""

However forensic scientist and DNA analyst Ryan Dewane testified this week that while his DNA was not found under Josephson's nails her DNA was ""almost definitely"" found under his.

Josephson’s parents Seymour and Marci Josephson have become activists for ride-share safety since losing their daughter.

Stories like Josephson's scare us bringing many questions back into our heads about we can stay safe using riding share services like Uber or Lyft.

To that end her parents started the Whats My Name Foundation the mission of which is to ""educate the world on ride share safety supporting charitable organizations and providing college scholarships to selected high school seniors.""

The What's My Name Foundation lays out a four-step safety plan named after Josephson: SAMI.

Stop: ""Plan ahead. Before you request a ride think about where you're headed and review the safety features in the app so you know how to use them.""

Advertisement

Ask: ""Ask your driver 'what's my name' to confirm they have booked a trip with you through the ride sharing app.""

Match: ""Match the make model and license plate of the car with the one displayed in the app.""

Inform: ""Share the details of your trip with a friend. Utilize the 'share status' function in your ride sharing app.""

They have also worked with lawmakers ""to advocate for policies that enhance safety for ride-share passengers"" with several laws having been enacted since their daughter's passing.

The Samantha L. Josephson Ridesharing Safety Act was signed into law in South Carolina on On June 5 2019.

The law requires ride-share vehicles to display license plate numbers on the front and subjects people who misrepresent themselves as authorized ride-share drivers to fines and potential incarceration.

New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy signed Sami's Law that same month.

Sami's Law requires additional identification be displayed on ride-share vehicles specifically placards which must be placed on the driver and passenger side back windows with the driver's name photo and license plate number among other protections.

The Passenger Protection Act was signed into law by the Governor of North Carolina in August 2019.

The act requires ride-share drivers to display a printed license plate number on the front of their vehicles and to have illuminated signs on their vehicles as well as creating a criminal penalty for impersonating a ride-share driver. It also provides funding for grants given to colleges for educating students about ride-share safety.

Additional legislation in this same area is pending on both the state and federal levels.

Rowland's trial is expected to last at least another week and is being live-streamed on YouTube by local News 19 WLTX.

If convicted Rowland faces up to life in prison without parole.

Sometimes you can't help but get into an Uber alone but if at any time you can travel with a buddy do it. There's a certain safety in numbers so whenever you can share an Uber with a friend do it.

And when you do be sure to ask the driver ""What's my name?""

As face masks come off many people are putting makeup back on.

Mask restrictions have lifted in many parts of the country though some places including Los Angeles County the most populated county in the USA are reinstating them because of a surge in COVID-19 cases.

Discarding masks in many settings is reason enough for some consumers to don colorful lipsticks and sparkly eyeshadow.

Available at Walmart. Prices range from $6 to $24.

Sharon Chuter is no stranger to forward thinking having founded Uoma Beauty and the Pull Up for Change campaign. Her next frontier? Accessibility which she’s aiming to address with a mass-market sister line to her first beauty brand. “My brand is currently hailed as inclusive but anyone who knows me knows I’m gonna call even my own bulls–t” Chuter said. “No beauty brand comes in every color every lifestyle or any budget….I really wanted to create a space where everybody could actually feel welcome.”

Chuter launched Uoma by Sharon C with six stock keeping units last month in a whopping 3365 Walmart doors. “They service 90 percent of America. It’s extremely democratic and people go there for many different reasons. Wide distribution was important to me” Chuter said.

The six debut skus units include the Go Awf! 2 In 1 Water-Activated Cleansing Wipes Go Awf! Au Natural Cleansing Oil Supa’Natural Glow Vitamin C Serum It’s Complicated Glossy Lip Tint & Oil Flawless IRL Foundation and Badder Boom Volumizing Mascara. Industry sources estimate the brand will reach $40 million in retail sales for its first year on the market.

Bubble

Available at Walmart. Prices range from $12 to $19.

When Shai Eisenman founded Bubble as a d-to-c skin care brand that catered to teenage and Gen Z skin concerns her first move was to turn to her consumer. “We’ve worked with over 6000 teens to create Bubble” Eisenman said.

To that end as part of the brand’s robust data collection among cohorts of young consumers she discovered 82 percent of teenagers prefer to purchase products in store and 41 percent of them go to Walmart at least several times monthly. When selecting Bubble’s retail partner the decision was obvious Eisenman said.

The brand debuted last week at Walmart with seven products from cleansers and toners to moisturizers and a mask. Eisenman prioritized keeping prices below $20 and the gender-inclusive skus have piqued Gen Z’s interest. Industry sources estimate the Bubble will hit $20 million in retail sales in 2022.

“This is specifically skin care for young skin. There’s always been a category for antiaging but teens aren’t looking for antiaging features they need products that will clear and balance their skin” Eisenman said.

Monday Haircare has launched at Walmart. Photo courtesy of Monday Haircare

Monday Haircare

Available at Walmart for $6.

When Monday Haircare launched in its native New Zealand it was given the nickname “liquid gold” for its precious appeal and scarcity driven by constant sell-outs. The brand which came Stateside at the beginning of 2021 has scaled up its business to enter the world’s largest retailer to keep up with the craze.

Although Monday Haircare initially launched at Target and Ulta Beauty Walmart helped the brand democratize premium hair care said founder Jaimee Lupton. “A lot of brands have an idea of an ideal customer and they put them in a bit of a box” Lupton said. “Because we’re available so widely and so affordably our brand is for absolutely everyone.

“We’ve proven that affordable hair care isn’t what it used to be — ours is an award-winning premium-quality product that just happens to be stocked at walmart.com” Lupton continued.

Consumers are responding well and industry sources expect the brand to hit $100 million at retail by year’s end.

Lupton herself a p.r. veteran also lauded the evolving assortment at Walmart. “Along with more premium traditional names such as Nars and Estée Lauder Walmart has really great positioning in carrying those more affordable but just-as-loved beauty brands” she said.

Health by Habit Photo courtesy of Health By Habit

Health by Habit

Available at Walmart for $8.88.

Bringing wellness to the masses may have been Health by Habit’s goal when it launched its ingestibles last year in New Zealand but when coming into Walmart as it expands into the U.S. the brand is eyeing Gen Z consumers.

“We thought if we target a niche — given the scale of Walmart and the U.S. as a whole — and double down to own that space there’s no other brand that’s going to be able to do that” said Liam Whittaker product and operations director at Health by Habit.

The brand which entered Walmart last month has centered its nine products on solutions for younger consumers as opposed to the single-ingredient supplements of the past.

“There’s a trend nowadays toward people moving away from individual vitamins and toward herbalist wellness solutions. We saw an opportunity to go and create a range of products which basically provided solutions to modern-day problems whether it’s lacking energy wanting an increase in immunity or better skin and nails” Whittaker said.

If early projections are any indication the brand’s play at younger consumers is a success. Industry sources think Health by Habit could hit $20 million in retail sales in its first year.

Luna Magic

Available at Walmart. Prices range from $8 to $20.

Luna Magic might have only launched two years ago but after an appearance on “Shark Tank” and receiving the Glossier grant for Black-owned businesses cofounders and sisters Mabel and Shaira Frías have proven the brand’s staying power.

Luna Magic’s full assortment 21 products spanning lashes eye shadows and pencils was made available last week in 405 Walmart doors. It is also merchandised on the retailer’s first bilingual endcap the sisters said.

“When we look at our brand and the content we put out it’s all about this dual world my sister and I live in” Mabel Frías said. “We are Latina but we are American because we have this flair and we identify with the Black diaspora. We are our consumer and we wanted to figure out a way to connect with her in two languages.”

Given Mabel Frías’ time as a director of digital merchandising at Savage x Fenty prior to cofounding the line she’s no stranger to driving decisions with data. “The 405 doors were a strategic bet on our end to make sure we’re looking at the data to see which stores are multicultural where Latina and African American women spend a lot of money on cosmetics” she said.

Industry sources estimate the brand’s retail sales will hit between $5 million and $10 million in 2022.

Dancing with Sheep Meadow Dance Theatre a New York City–based troupe helmed by choreographer Billy Blanken this was Pretto’s first time back onstage since retiring from Les Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo in October 2019. It was also Pretto’s first time performing as a trans woman—as Sabrina and not Alberto the name she was given at birth.

Pretto 35 grew up in Vicenza Italy and came to ballet at the relatively late age of 14. She trained at the Princess Grace Academy in Monte Carlo before joining the German company Stadttheater Koblenz. It was during her two years there that Pretto began to feel a sense of discomfort with what was being asked of her as a dancer.

“The roles were very set in stone and I had to do a lot of partnering and a lot of male parts” she remembers. “I felt weird and not in my place.”

In response to feeling “boxed in” Pretto turned to one of her earliest passions: pointework. Though she’d been taking some classes on pointe since her days as a young student in Italy she now started wearing pointe shoes regularly and rehearsing female variations on her own. One day while expressing her frustrations to the company’s director he recommended that Pretto look into the Trocks. And after a few rounds of auditions Pretto packed her bags and moved to New York. Pretto’s eight years with the Trocks were rich with opportunity and experience and she says her talents were nurtured. But as time went on Pretto began to feel like there were still parts of her gender expression that she was forced to tamp down. “When I had to represent the company I might be asked to wear something less feminine or appear in a different way” she says referring to open rehearsals or travel days on tour. In 2018 former Trocks dancer Chase Johnsey came forward with claims of harassment and discrimination by the company management alleging that he was told he could no longer perform with the company should he choose to undergo a gender transition a message Pretto says that she had also always understood. “It was never said in black and white but I knew that it would have caused problems” she says. (An independent investigation following Johnsey’s claims found no merit to the legal allegations.)

Pretto waited until she felt she’d gotten the most out of her time with the Trocks before leaving. “I do feel that it would be amazing if they understood that there is a bigger spectrum of gender identities” says Pretto. “Things are changing and if they don’t keep up with the times they’ll be left behind.” Pretto thinks of the past two years as her transition in every sense. At the same time as she made her career change she also began hormone therapy. Though she tried to continue her daily regimen of ballet class she found that the effects of the hormones made dancing at a high level nearly impossible during the first few months. “I felt very out of breath and was having palpitations when I was doing small jumps” says Pretto. Though she worked with her doctors to readjust her dosages she felt that her stamina was lacking. And then just as she was adjusting to dancing in her changing body COVID-19 hit. The pandemic forced her to take a break and the time off gave her the space to open up her eyes to what else she might be interested in pursuing. She applied for a slew of jobs eventually landing positions teaching ballet at New York City’s American Youth Dance Theater and as a makeup consultant at Ulta Beauty. She also runs a small-scale sewing business making dancewear and costumes for friends and select customers.

And now thanks to SMDT Pretto has been able to incorporate performing into her life once again. At first rehearsing for Sleeping Beauty felt hard both physically and emotionally. “It was a struggle of knowing your body used to be able to do things that it can’t do anymore but I sort of accepted it because there’s no use fighting and getting upset over that” says Pretto. She also faced anxieties about comparing herself to cisgender ballerinas feelings that dissolved once she was warmly welcomed by the rest of the cast. “I didn’t even realize honestly that I used to perform with drag makeup and wigs and in comparison this felt very natural it felt organic” says Pretto. Pretto’s decision to wait so long to transition was born of fear that she’d have to give up her dance career. She holds close the hope that the ballet world will continue to become more accessible to dancers of all stripes so others might not have to wait in the same way that she did. “I was always so afraid of not being able to fit into the mold of ‘ballerina'” she says. “But the human body’s beautiful. All different types of people can dance amazingly.”"

But which airline ranked the best from April 2020 to March 2021?

According to The Points Guy’s Best Airlines analysis Delta Air Lines yet again keeps the top spot for best overall experience for flyers for the third year in a row.

AIRLINES ARE REBOUNDING EVEN AS PRICES SURGE: ADOBE

""Once again Delta Air Lines rose to the top of TPG’s Best Airlines analysis"" says Nick Ewen Senior Editor at The Points Guy. ""The data showed that the carrier offers consistent high-quality performance — from its reliability to the in-flight experience to its SkyMiles loyalty program. As the travel industry continues to bounce back from the coronavirus pandemic Delta is well-positioned to capitalize on the rebound.""

Following Delta was Southwest Airlines which came in second place. Allegiant Air on the other hand ranked as the worst airline.

The study looked at the 10 major airline carriers across a variety of factors including reliability experience loyalty and costs and reach.

Delta didn’t necessarily stand out in any single category but its consistency across all objectives is what allowed it to keep the top spot versus the other airlines.

The carrier ranked number one in both reliability and travel experience which are two key indicators in judging airline quality. Its frequent flyer program also held good standing ranking second place overall.

Customer service was also included where Delta was part of a four-way tie for runner-up with fewer than 10 complaints per 100000 passengers.

Additionally Delta tied for the top spot for lounge access with Alaska Airlines and tied with Allegiant and Hawaiian for zero involuntary bumps during the 12th-month period.

Southwest Airlines which came in second place overall ranked number one in customer service with an average of just over three complaints per 100000 passengers. It also took the top spot in baggage and change fees which were about .31 cents per passenger and award availability where it offered the most availability at the best value compared to the other airlines’ programs. The area it lacked was lounges.

Allegiant which stood at last place ranked poorly in terms of timeliness cancellations and its no-frills experience which included no Wi-Fi entertainment or outlets. The low-cost carrier also requires its passengers to be co-branded credit card holders in order to earn miles which lead them to score near zero in loyalty.

On Friday the S&P 500 index crossed the 4400-mark for the first time while the Dow Jones Industrial Average moved past 35000 and reached a new high. Meanwhile weekly jobless claims increased unexpectedly to around 419000 dampening hopes of labor market recovery.

Continuing its buyout spree Accenture bought two technology companies early this week — Toronto-based Oracle cloud service provider Cloudworks and workforce optimization consultancy Workforce Insight – and completed the previously announced acquisition of France-based cybersecurity firm Openminded.

In another tech deal Microsoft agreed to acquire security start-up CloudKnox. Meanwhile Visa clinched a deal to buy Currencycloud for about 700 million pounds.

The airline industry dominated the earnings scene this week with United Airlines reporting results on Tuesday and Southwest Airlines and American Airlines releasing their second-quarter statements on Thursday. Earlier IBM came out with positive numbers for its most recent quarter on Monday. The next day all eyes were on streaming giant Netflix which published mixed results in the after-hours.

Energy firm Kinder Morgan Seagate Technology Verizon soft drink major Coca-Cola and Johnson & Johnson stole the show on Wednesday. Thursday was as busy as usual with the major events being the second-quarter earnings releases of telecom firm AT&T fast-food chain Domino’s Pizza Biogen Abbott Laboratories Intel as well as social networking platforms Twitter and Snap. Schlumberger American Express and Kimberly-Clark reported Friday before the opening bell.

While Lockheed Martin is probably the only major company to report earnings on July 26 the market will be closely following the report of Alphabet on July 27. The Google parent will be joined by gadget giant Apple chipmaker AMD Starbucks and Microsoft in the after-hours. Before the opening bell aviation firm JetBlue and engineering behemoth General Electric are scheduled to report earnings.

The financial releases of Bristol-Myers Squibb aircraft builder Boeing and Ford Motor are the key events slated for July 28. The next day is going to be as hectic when the earnings announcements of e-commerce giant Amazon.com Altria Group Yum! Brands and Merck & Co. are on tap. Procter & Gamble oil giant ExxonMobil and Caterpillar are among the major companies preparing to report on July 30.

Netflix's latest true crime docuseries Heist tells the story of three of the most unbelievable crimes in American history

Netflix Heist: The Unbelievable true stories behind new true crime series

Netflix's latest true crime series Heist tells the unbelievable real stories behind three crimes.

The six-part documentary series chronicles the biggest heists in modern American history – told by those who committed the crimes.

Emmy-nominated director and executive producer Derek Doneen said: ""We said from the very beginning that we wanted this to be a fun true-crime series with a lot of heart.

""We wanted to unpack what drives somebody to do this and to truly understand them you have to know about their lives up until that point.""

The synopsis explains: ""Viewers will see how the subjects select their targets the meticulous planning that goes into the job the sweet glory of success and the boneheaded errors that lead investigators straight to the truth.

""The perpetrators sit down for in-depth frequently emotional conversations alongside family members accomplices and the law enforcement officers who eventually brought them to justice.""

Three different heists are explained with two episodes each. Here we take a closer look at the shocking true stories behind each heist.

Sex Magick Money

The first two episodes of Heist are about American fugitive Heather Tallchief and her partner Roberto Solis.

Tallchief 21 met the 48-year-old convicted murderer in early 1993 – and went to fall in love with him.

But she also recalls being easily manipulated by him – especially through the use of hypnotism she said.

Under the instruction from Solis Tallchief took a job at armoured security company Loomis.

On October 1 1993 she drove a truck which was transporting $3.1million in cash to cash machines in Las Vegas to Solis who was waiting in a nearby industrial estate with a getaway car.

Together they unloaded the cash and went on the run before settling down in Amsterdam the Netherlands in 1994.

Tallchief who was on the run for 12 years ended up getting pregnant and giving birth to a son.

She turned herself in in 2005 and faced charges of embezzlement bank fraud bank robbery and using a firearm for a violent crime. She was sentenced to five years in prison in 2006 and was released in 2010.

The Money Plane

Image: © 2021 Netflix Inc.) © 2021 Netflix Inc.)

Episode three and four is about Karls Monzon who robbed $7.4million from a warehouse at Miami International Airport.

At the time of the robbery Monzon was a 32-year-old driver for a construction equipment company called United Rentals – and he had no criminal record.

Monzon and his wife Brandy had gone through several miscarriages and unsuccessful fertility treatments.

They were desperate to adopt a child – but it was an expensive process.

Monzon a self-confessed fan of crime shows knew that cash from Miami's Federal Reserve Bank was regularly left unguarded in an open warehouse at the airport.

After weeks of planning Monzon and a few friends and family members carried out the robbery by ordering airport employees to the ground and grabbing six bags of cash.

The group decided to lay low until attention died down but Monzon's brother-in-law flaunted his money – catching the attention of the FBI.

After the FBI offered a $150000 reward for information Monzon's friend face forward and provided a list of suspects.

In 2006 Karls was charged with armed robbery and pleaded guilty. He was sentenced to 11 years but served 10.

The Bourbon King

The final episodes of Heist is about The Bourbon King or the famous ""Pappygate"" heist.

In October 2014 $100000 worth of aged Pappy Van Winkle Bourbon went missing from Buffalo Trace distillery in Tennessee.

Former elite-league footballer Gilbert ""Toby"" Curtsinger was working at the distillery and had started smuggling the bottles and selling them.

However his money-making business ended in 2015 when investigators were tipped off about what was going on.

The anonymous tip-off claimed that he had barrels of stolen bourbon in his backyard.

Curtsinger was sentenced to 15 years in prison but was released on probation after one month because he was a ""first time offender who poses no threat to society"".

His parole supervision isn't due to end until 2023.",,,,,,,,,,,,

This marinated chicken dish hails from Negros (the island Gilbuena was born on) and stars ingredients like calamansi —a Filipino citrus fruit—and oil infused with annatto seeds which come from native trees. One Spanish-influenced dish she makes an exception for? Flan. ""I have a very fond memory of flan because my grandmother used to make me eat my vegetables by hiding them in it!"" Gilbuena laughs.

But she also considers her food to be an act of resistance and rebellion. When Spain colonized the Philippines in 1565 its influence settled over the islands like a ton of bricks. And although the country gained its independence in 1898 the rubble still remains today evident in everything from the religion and culture to the food. So Gilbuena makes a point to serve dishes that are as precolonial or Indigenous-inspired as possible.

Back to that D.C. pop-up. Gilbuena recalls telling the stubborn diner that he could eat with his hands—or he could leave and she'd refund his money. (He chose the former.) ""It was funny because he was Filipino!"" Gilbuena exclaims. ""I was like 'Dude that colonial mentality is buried in there really deep!'"" When Gilbuena's U.S. tour ended she barely caught her breath before bringing her pop-ups to cities across Canada then Colombia Mexico Australia and most recently in 2019 to Europe. Her travels are on pause due to the COVID-19 pandemic but the recipes included here will help you create a kamayan feast at home—no forks allowed.

How to Set Up a Kamayan-Style Meal

Cover your table with butcher paper or newspaper to protect it then top with banana leaves (look for them at Asian and Latin markets). Start at the outer edges of the table and work your way toward the center making sure to lay them down with the shiny ridged side up. Trim any overhanging banana leaves so the edges are flush with the table. Shape the rice along the middle of the table or put scoops of rice in the center. Arrange dishes on and in between the rice. Things you can easily pick up—like Chicken Inasal and Ensaladang Ubod— can go on top of and next to the rice. Others can be contained in a variety of ways. Scoop salads into hollowed-out pineapple halves coconut cups or large sturdy leaves like cabbage; you can also create ""dams"" for them with various fruits and vegetables. This should go without saying but have your guests wash their hands before coming to the table. Folks should serve themselves with their nondominant hand and eat with their dominant hand. If you want to take extra COVID precautions use the banana leaves like place mats and create individual kamayan-style spreads. To eat use a technique that Gilbuena calls ""Pick Pack and Push"": ""Pick"" up some rice and veggies or meat ""pack"" it into a bite-size ball with your fingers and then use your thumb to ""push"" it in your mouth.

Key Ingredients to a Kamayan-Style Meal

Atsuete oil: Also called annatto or achiote oil this red oil adds color and nutty flavor to recipes. To make your own steep 2 Tbsp. annatto seeds in 1/4 cup hot canola or coconut oil for 30 minutes. Strain and discard the seeds.

Calamansi juice: A tart and floral relative of the kumquat calamansi is the predominant citrus used in Filipino cooking. Look for the juice bottled or frozen. Lime or lemon juice can be substituted. (Try calamansi in Bistek Tagalog).

Coconut cream: Thicker and richer than coconut milk coconut cream is the solid part that rises to the top of canned coconut milk. It's also sold separately. Skip anything labeled cream of coconut which is sweetened and used to make things like cocktails.

Coconut vinegar: Made from the nectar of flowers from the coconut tree this mild vinegar has a slightly sweet coconutty aftertaste. It's a staple throughout Southeast Asia and parts of India. Use it in marinades and dressings or to make pickled vegetables.

Fish sauce: This is the ultimate umami sauce. Gilbuena recommends seeking out one made with just anchovy salt and water for the best flavor.

Ginisang bagoong: This fermented seafood paste part of a family of Filipino secret-weapon condiments gets its brown hue from sautéed garlic and onion. You can use fish sauce instead for a similar vibe.

Tamarind: Filipinos' go-to souring agent is tamarind. This tropical tree produces a sour-sweet fruit in a brown pod with edible pulp. It's often sold in concentrate or pulp form. You can make your own ""concentrate"" by mixing 1/4 cup pulp and 1 cup hot water in a medium bowl. Let stand for 20 minutes. Break up the paste and mix it with the water with a fork. Pass the mixture through a fine sieve set over a bowl pressing against the solids and scraping the underside of it to collect as much of the pulp as possible. Discard solids.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Modern democracy arose because America’s radical founders renounced the divine right of kings and took up arms against England and George III. They created government of the people with no aristocracy.

Slavery ended because radical abolitionists hammered the entrenched institution until the horrible Civil War wiped it out.

Following the new knowledge given to humankind by Gandhi many more gains in human rights started to be made with nonviolent struggle instead of war.

Women gained the right to vote because radical suffragettes fought for decades against their inferior status.

Couples gained the right to birth control because radical feminists – especially Margaret Sanger – battled against prudes and the church.

Workers gained the right to organize unions because President Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal defeated corporate opposition and legalized it. And retirees gained Social Security pensions because the progressive New Deal created the safety net program.

Jobless people gained unemployment compensation – and those injured on the job gained worker’s compensation − because the New Deal created them too. Additionally it set the 40-hour work week banned child labor and set a minimum wage.

The poor gained welfare protection from the liberal New Deal also.

Censorship of sexy books magazines and movies was wiped out by progressive court cases. So were bluenose laws forcing stores to close on the Sabbath.

The historic civil rights movement and the progressive Supreme Court under Chief Justice Earl Warren struck down America’s cruel Jim Crow segregation. The Warren court also ended government-led prayer in schools. It wiped out state laws against birth control. Later liberal justices gave women and girls a right to choose to end pregnancies.

Taboos against lotteries liquor clubs and other “sins” fell away.

Strides toward universal health care as a human right for everyone included Medicare Medicaid Children’s Health Insurance Veterans’ care government employees coverage and finally Obamacare.

Conservatives tried to prevent teaching of evolution in public schools but they failed.

Conservatives tried to teach “creation” in public schools but they failed.

Conservatives tried to block sex education in public schools but they failed.

Puritanical right-wingers made racial intermarriage a crime but the liberal Warren court legalized it.

Puritanical right-wingers jailed gay lovers but progressives on the high court forced the government to get its nose out of the bedroom.

Fundamentalists fought same-sex marriage but Democratic state legislatures and ultimately the Supreme Court legalized it.

Humanism means helping people and secular means doing it without supernatural religion. Decade after decade century after century leftist reformers defeated conservatives to advance secular humanism. At the same time churches and their magical beliefs faded enormously from western democracies.

More recently international warfare has virtually disappeared.

Pioneer Unitarian minister Theodore Parker said the arc of history bends toward justice – and Martin Luther King Jr. who spent years as a young man attending a Unitarian church adopted the phrase masterfully.

The past shows a clear pattern of human progress – of civilization bending toward justice. Let’s hope it continues.

I have been very pleased to see the new North Quadra Urgent and Primary Care Centre on Chatterton Way in Saanich.

Thanks to government for the new clinics

Re: “Downtown Victoria gets an urgent care centre” July 22.

I have been very pleased to see the new North Quadra Urgent and Primary Care Centre on Chatterton Way in Saanich.

I have had over my 15 years in Victoria a wonderful general practice physician with his own practice facilities in partnership with another doctor but I realize I am fortunate and among the few and might have needed access to general practice care without him.

Before these new UPCC clinics were opening I searched in frustration for walk-in clinics that would be available to two different friends who were either new to Victoria or whose doctor had retired — either the privately run clinics would not answer the telephone their website if in existence had little information and frequently said “closed” and on visiting several one had to stay outside and make a phone call [all this prior to COVID-19] to make an appointment.

What about someone without a car ­trying to settle on one of these clinics? Yes the Medimap service on the web helped but not all clinics were affiliated with it.

Then when seeing a long line of seniors standing outside a walk-in clinic in a nearby shopping centre one cold morning around 7:30 a clinic that did not seem to have a presence online I wrote to Health Minister Adrian Dix and was thankfully advised of the soon-to-open urgent and primary care clinics. And nurses and nurse practitioners are welcome surely for blood pressure and skin-care checks etc.

Thank you Government of B.C.

Regarding not always seeing the same doctor sometimes a second opinion is valuable.

Young doctors were not coming here to practice owing to costly real estate and staff as well as sky-high living costs.

The physician from one of the existing clinics not part of this new network who was described in the article as advocating government assistance to the older method of privately funded practices with continuing same-physician care could certainly practise in one of the UPCCs which are trying to provide that as well.

I don’t understand his criticism of the new service: When he retires what will happen to his patients? New young doctors couldn’t afford the real estate. And other privately held walk-in clinics are closing as well.

Saskatchewan recruits doctors vigorously for its remote areas including from other countries and supports their services with clinic space and staff.

A dismal failure of the medical system

I never thought that I would witness the demise of the family doctor. One more urgent and primary care centre in ­Victoria puts another nail in the coffin of the system of traditional doctor/patient ongoing care.

Each UPCC is geographically based. To even apply to become a patient two pieces of ID are required to prove residency within the established boundaries of each UPCC.

And if the Westshore UPCC is anything to go by this taxpayer-funded system is a dismal failure.

I needed an X-ray requisition and dutifully arrived at 7:15 a.m. and lined up with 20 other people to wait for the 8 a.m. opening only to be told at 8 a.m. that the facility was “at capacity” because only one doctor had shown up for work that day!

How can a sick person get the care they need when no one seems to care?

Provincial UPCCs are working well

Re. “Downtown Victoria gets an urgent care centre” July 22.

The province’s new urgent and primary care centres were created with the goals of reducing the number of British Columbians who don’t have a family doctor and lessening pressure on hospital emergency rooms. Once they become fully operational and statistical analysis is done we’ll learn whether the goals have been met. But I suspect that they will prove to be successful in these regards.

This article quotes an Oak Bay doctor who questions the nature of care provided by these centres and I am writing to set his mind at ease.

My wife and I have been “attached” to the James Bay UPCC since it opened almost two years ago and we can testify that we are receiving better health care now than we did previously from our family physician and our neighbourhood clinic.

Each of us has been assigned to a ­primary care doctor at the centre both of whom have taken a strong personal ­interest in our health.

They supervise our medication ­requisition recommended tests provide specialist referrals conduct periodic examinations and initiate calls to check up on us from time to time. They ­remember us individually and ­proactively monitor our well-being.

They are assisted by a range of ­supporting health practitioners on-site and if one of them is unavailable at a time when we need their help an alternative professional is present at the centre to fill in with equally capable care.

Our UPCC is well-staffed administratively and they respond promptly to our calls for appointments instructions and consultations with our doctors.

Wait times are minimal and our centre operates effectively as both a walk-in clinic and a longitudinal provider of individualized medical care.

The quoted doctor in Oak Bay may rest easy about the quality and consistency of care provided by B.C.’s new UPCCs and I encourage the government to ­proceed confidently with the expansion of this progressive response to the ­serious health-care delivery problems in our province.

Pay family doctors what they deserve

Family doctors have the hardest job yet are paid the least. They must have a working knowledge of changes in all areas of medicine.

So they have to do lots of reading. They work long hours. New graduates do not want to be GPs.

Being a specialist takes a few more years of education but it pays off in huge salaries and a narrow focus and shorter hours.

We need to pay GPs a lot more and help them with business expenses. If we do not we have an inferior medical system. And the problem has reached a crisis level.

COVID puts health-care dollars at risk

As a retired physician it has been ­obvious that our universal health care system has been a wonder but a constant fiscal struggle.

Health-care dollars are fixed by ­budgets themselves limited by the ­willingness of us all to pay taxes.

Wasting health care always takes away some other form of care ­delivery: ­surgeries public health outpatient ­clinics as examples.

Refusal to be vaccinated against COVID now widely available miraculously is an individual’s choice but that choice has real costs: Risks to self and others and in the end denial of all health care that could have been avoided.

Why do we put up with this?

I can imagine that it won’t be long until private health-care insurers in the United States will deny claims for COVID care for unvaccinated patients.

B.C. and all of Canada should consider this.

No COVID vaccine? Then no public activities

There should be no discussion as to the benefits of the COVID-19 vaccines!

In addition to being ignorant most of the people who are refusing to be ­vaccinated against the COVID-19 virus are irresponsible and selfish. Ninety-nine per cent of the population who have recently been infected by the Delta variant of this coronavirus have not had their vaccines. Those of us who have recieved our double vaccines are not becoming ill. Thus the greatest danger to our population is the unvaccinated population. These people are a danger to our defeating the pandemic.

Other than people who have valid health reasons for turning down the ­vaccines no one who has rejected the vaccines should be permitted to ­participate in any public activities. Nor should they be allowed to travel ­anywhere by mass transportation.

We are so fortunate in B.C. to have available vaccines for anybody who wishes to be protected against this deadly virus. There are so many countries who have barely started to vaccinate their populations. I expect that they would trade places with us in a flash.

Canada should be helping to donate vaccines to all the countries that cannot afford them.

West Virginia not a great example

Re: “Trepidation about those Americans” letters July 22.

I am curious as to why the writer chose West Virginia as his bogeyman. Since this is clearly a letter about the COVID-19 crisis and fears of infected travellers I should point out that West Virginia is doing better than the national average for cases per capita and deaths per capita.

True they are lagging behind in vaccination rates but they are certainly not the worst. There are several states in the South that are far behind West Virginia which is not part of the South.

So again I have to ask why reference a “Winnebago full of West Virginians”? Out of ignorance perhaps?

I am a dual citizen of Canada and the United States. I was born in West ­Virginia where most of my family still lives and where I still maintain a home in Canaan Valley.

I don’t appreciate the anti-American digs in general but especially dislike the singling out of West Virginians for an insult in his letter. Has he been to West Virginia know anyone from there?

No logical sense in border closures

Premier John Horgan was a bit out of touch with reality when he said that not many Canadians are interested in going to the United States by land at this time of year.

Of course Canadians (lots of them) cross the U.S. border during any time of year by the thousands. Just check the number of reservations on B.C. Ferries and the Coho ferry and you will find that those ferries are full of Canadian tourists heading south to Disneyland with kids.

Las Vegas shopping in Seattle ­baseball games in Seattle and so on. Although we can still fly to the U.S. many people prefer to drive that way pets can ­accompany them. Most motels nowadays accept pets.

The U.S. border not being open to us until August or later doesn’t make any logical sense to me because the rules at both borders are the same; everyone must be fully vaccinated for COVID so why have different crossing dates?

Reverend Al deserves thanks from us all

I remember this gentle man Rev. Al Tysick coming down to the welfare office to be sure people got their cheques on time. He worked quietly making sure he cared for them.

To think he worked quietly amongst us for 35 years and we as part of the rest of the community owe him our ­collected thanks. He really did the most ­remarkable job caring for everyone regardless of race colour or creed.

Getting to the truth takes too much time

Re: “Residential schools letter was racist and derisive” letter July 21.

As the writer of the original letter I would like to thank the contributor for proving my point exactly.

There is nothing racist in me. I work with First Nations and will not be shamed into becoming a liar to serve an agenda.

Nowhere in my letter did I deny what transpired at residential schools the point was to make ultra-liberals actually read the report instead of spewing sound bites taken as truth which clearly didn’t happen as you’ve gone straight back to the rhetoric without an ounce of seeing why I wrote the letter.

As for trying to be cruel toward ­survivors that is an assumption — and it is incorrect. It seems apparent that as with too many people today trying to hone in to get to the truth is just too much work so instead the letter has slandered my name and the editors.

Misappropriating text taken out of context is a common trait to conveniently misguide others to a chosen point of view.

Virtue signalling does not solve the problems with the First Nations it only prolongs and obfuscates it.

Too many ferries not enough trains

So B.C. Ferries is putting two ferries on the Quadra Island route (population 2400) and Gabriola Island (population 6000).

How about spending the equivalent money on the E&N Railway? Giving people on two tiny islands two ferries is a waste of everyone’s money and is not needed. Dumping tons of money into more buses is not the answer either.

Do the smart thing and put money into the railway.

MB July 2021 Special Report | A patient hospital



Irish researcher Michael O’Regan Bournemouth University (UK) published a paper last year on the current social situation in Macau (Post-Colonial Macau: hope and despair in a World Center of Tourism and Leisure).

His research included interviews of two dozen residents in Macau.

Mary 23 argued that “although the government offers many monetary benefits to citizens the soft benefits and compensation are not enough. The quality of medical treatment in Macau is so terrible that people must go to Hong Kong and China for treatment when they get ill. And even though you just have a cold you have spent too much time waiting for treatment in the public hospitals”. On the other side Chris 59 claims that “it is very difficult to consult a doctor as it takes a very long time even to book a date [to see a doctor].”

These two statements alone are not sufficient to conclude there is widespread dissatisfaction among residents over the health services provided by the Government but there are further elements we can add.

“Both civil society and the government speak for themselves but citizens’ sense of happiness in relation to health services cannot be reflected in public opinion which in fact warrants study and greater attention on the part of the Government and the health sector” lawmaker Chan Iek Lap the only doctor sitting on the Legislative Assembly believes.

Perhaps this is why the Policy Address for 2021 reveals that last year the Health Bureau launched an investigation into the circumstances in which residents turn to medical services and the level of health protection along with a feasibility study for the operating models of the Islands Medical Complex.



“Citizens’ sense of happiness in relation to health services cannot be reflected in public opinion which in fact warrants study and greater attention on the part of the Government and the health sector” – Chan Iek Lap

Ho Iat Seng revealed last year that the health care budget rose to MOP12 billion in 2020 (in the first years following the Handover Macau spent MOP1.1 billion on health care a figure that stood at MOP8 billion 15 years later). The Chief Executive also announced that with operation of the Islands Medical Complex medical expenses would increase by a factor of 1.5 to 2.

“The steady increase in health expenditures can be seen as a ‘big white elephant’ as citizens do not feel there have been significant improvements in access to health care the waiting time remains long in the case of particularly serious or urgent illnesses and the effects of treatment are not satisfactory prompting some citizens to leave Macau to seek out treatments and doctors and incurring heavy expenses” lawmaker Si Ka Lon said this year.

Even so Macau spends far less than the models it usually takes as reference: for example annual health care expenses in Macau account for about 10 per cent of total government expenditure whereas in Singapore that figure reaches 13 per cent in Hong Kong 16 per cent and in Taiwan 25 per cent (Taiwan has a comprehensive universal health protection system).

Healthcare Subsidy Scheme: “tremendous support”

The Healthcare Subsidy Scheme created in 2009 “has always deserved recognition from the general population as it has not only reduced both residents’ burdens and to some extent waiting times for consultation but has also promoted the general development of the private health sector” lawmaker Zheng Anting believes.

The legislator adds however that “as health care needs vary according to different age groups the Government is expected to make an appropriate adjustment to the health vouchers policy in line with the needs of residents.

“Many residents have told me that it is the elderly for the most part who suffer from chronic illnesses and have weak resistance to even the most frequent mild illnesses. Due to their age they are more likely to suffer from problems with their teeth and eyesight. But as private medical consultations are more expensive even if the elderly use their own health vouchers plus those of their family members it is not possible to cover all expenses and the health vouchers of the majority of the elderly are exhausted in the first months” Zheng Anting wrote to the Government.

“As the current amount of health vouchers is not enough to meet needs most elderly people opt for the public health system so waiting rooms are still full” Zheng Anting continues asking “the authorities to improve the health voucher plan.”

In 2009 when the Healthcare Subsidy Scheme was launched each permanent resident received health vouchers worth MOP500. In 2013 the value went up to MOP600.

The Health Bureau’s response to legislator Zheng states that since then “the program has been improved namely with the implementation of electronic health vouchers and the extension of the period of use to two years facilitating use by residents” adding that “since the implementation of this program there has been tremendous support from both residents and the sector and in general the program has been successful.”

President Rodrigo Duterte delivers his 5th State of the Nation Address at the House of Representatives Complex in Quezon City on July 27 2020.

MANILA Philippines (Talamitam.org) — From landmark Comprehensive Tax Reform Program to the controversial passage of the Anti-Terror Law Talamitam looks back on President Rodrigo Duterte’s legislative promises ahead of his final State of the Nation Address (SONA).

Duterte has so far signed 19 of his legislative priorities but 41 measures remain pending in both the Senate and the House of Representatives. This is despite the fact that the president’s allies constitute a supermajority in Congress which could fast track the passage of his priority bills.

Political experts suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic may have reshuffled Duterte’s legislative agenda prioritizing more essential bills like the Bayanihan laws over others. Internal rifts such as the one going on within Partido Demokratiko Pilipino-Lakas ng Bayan (PDP-Laban) only underscore the fragility of Duterte’s political coalition.

With less than a year in office what will be the president’s agenda for his final SONA?

Froilan Calilung a political science professor at the University of Santo Tomas (UST) said that this final state address would be a “reevaluation and recapitulation” of the Duterte administration’s work in the past years.

This includes the war on drugs attempts to dislodge the oligarchs and make huge tax evaders pay their taxes as well as the current diplomatic dealings with China he told Talamitam in an interview.

Legislative and policy consultant Michael Yusingco said he had “little expectations” for the final SONA but feared that Duterte would use it to announce his vice-presidential bid.

“I expect his listing of achievements and also really gripes about his opponents his critics but beyond that I have little expectations” he told Talamitam in an online interview.

“[P]ero sa totoo lang ang kinakatakutan ko (But the truth is I fear) that he will finally declare that he will run again as VP because that will certainly distract him in his last year instead of focusing on really getting the job done because he has a lot of backlogs and unfulfilled promises” he added.

Meanwhile Malacañang remains optimistic that Congress will pass Duterte’s remaining priority bills before his term ends and even with the upcoming national polls.

“Well kampante naman po kami dahil napakabuti po ng samahan ng presidente sa parehong kapulungan ng Kongreso na kung talagang urgent ang nature ng bill eh maipapasa naman po iyan (We are confident in the passage of these urgent bills because of the good relationship between the president and both houses in Congress)” presidential spokesman Harry Roque said during a Palace briefing.

“[K]inakailangan ipasa na [priority bills] sa lalong mabilis na panahon (they need to be passed immediately) kasi kapag pinaabot pa natin sa susunod na taon alam natin busy na sa pulitika ang lahat (Otherwise everyone will be busy with politics come next year). So the priority bills must be heard and hopefully passed within the year 2021” he added.

Talamitam assessed Duterte’s legislative scorecard and found that some priority measures have yet to be fulfilled while some after being signed into law need a review of their implementation.

Economy

Tax reforms easing economic restrictions — Pending

In his first SONA Duterte promised tax reforms geared toward a simpler “more equitable” tax system to bring in investments and create jobs. The Comprehensive Tax Reform Program (CTRP) was the Duterte administration’s response.

Four out of the eight CTRP packages have been signed into law including the Corporate Recovery and Tax Incentives for Enterprises (Create) Act enacted last March.

The Create Act boasts of the largest stimulus package in the country’s history cutting down the corporate income tax rate by five percentage points and granting different fiscal incentives to enterprises among others.

Tax reform packages passed earlier included the law increasing excise taxes on tobacco and alcohol products the Tax Amnesty Act and the Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion (Train) Law.

Meanwhile the remaining four packages are pending in Congress including the proposed real property reform and Passive Income Financial Intermediary Taxation Act.

With the 2022 national elections right around the corner Calilung said Congress would have little time acting on the remaining CTRP measures.

“We are actually in the homestretch. Once we start the filing of the candidacy come October everything else will be on the election” he said.

Lawmakers seeking reelection are likely to support the president’s remaining priority economic measures to gain favor from the public Marlon Villarin a political science instructor in UST said.

In his first SONA in 2016 Duterte vowed to ease economic restrictions in the country. He certified as urgent in April amendments to the Public Service Act the Foreign Investments Act and the Retail Trade Liberalization Act.

The president signed into law last February the Financial Institutions Strategic Transfer Act which will address financial institutions’ bad loans arising from the pandemic.

Coconut trust fund rice tariffication laws — Enacted

In the agri-economic sector the Coconut Farmers’ and Industry Trust Fund Act was finally passed in February—nearly five years after Duterte promised to sign such a law in his first 100 days in office.

Under this law the government will establish a trust fund for the tax levies stolen from the coconut industry and its farmers during the Marcos era.

The Rice Tariffication Law which liberalizes rice imports to ensure adequate supply of the staple was passed in February 2019.

Education

Alternative learning system law — Enacted

Though Duterte has been pithy when it comes to his plans for the education sector during his previous SONAs he was able to sign into law a measure institutionalizing the country’s Alternative Learning Systems (ALS) which will allow out-of-school youth and students in marginalized sectors to pursue a proper education. It will also help create more salaried teaching positions to bolster the ALS Teachers Program. The ALS Act was signed into law in January.

Universal access to tertiary education — Enacted

The Universal Access to Quality Tertiary Education Act signed into law in August 2017 ensured full government subsidy for the tuition and miscellaneous fees of students enrolled in state and local universities and colleges in the country. The Commission on Higher Education in May said that nearly 1.6 million students were benefiting from the program despite the prohibition of face-to-face classes due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The education sector is one of the most severely affected by the pandemic and its long lockdowns with schools closing down and students grappling with the new distance learning setup.

Calilung said many universities did not possess the infrastructure yet to acquire new technologies and facilities.

Yusingco said that the situation revealed the flaws of the country’s education system and called for reforms in existing laws.

“I think we need to review the current set of laws that form the framework of our public education system. What we do need is really more attention on improving our education system” he said.

Health

Universal health care — Enacted

One of the chief executive’s earliest promises was the passage of a Universal Health Care (UHC) Law which aims to provide the poor access to medical services.

“The government will also provide universal health insurance for all Filipinos benefits… Sali na lang natin sa PhilHealth” Duterte said in his first SONA five years ago. Three years later in February 2019 the bill was signed into law.

One of the UHC’s salient features is the establishment of the National Health Insurance Program which will automatically enroll Filipinos into the program’s array of health services from preventive care to rehabilitative care.

But despite the well-intended premise of the law its implementation has been dogged by a combination of internal problems and legal issues all of which have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.

The problems which were highlighted by the corruption controversies that hounded PhilHealth hindered Filipinos from benefiting from this landmark law.

“I think [the UHC Law] may actually be relegated to the background for a considerable degree of time until we merge out of the pandemic kasi nagkaroon ng problema with the [Implementing Rules and Regulations] and there is also the problem with the agencies themselves like the DOH and the PhilHealth” Calilung said.

Yusingco said that aside from potential improvements in the UHC Law there was also a lack of resolve from the Department of Health a major stakeholder to further implement it properly.

Expansion of Malasakit Centers — Enacted

Malasakit Centers were originally a pet project by long-time Duterte aide Sen. Bong Go to provide Filipinos especially the indigent population a so-called “one-stop shop” to avail themselves of medical or financial assistance offered by the national government.

In his 2019 SONA Duterte cited the expansion of Malasakit Centers as one of the projects he wanted to prioritize and later that year he signed the Malasakit Center Act.

However Yusingco pointed out that communities needed more wide-reaching health institutions instead of these “upgraded barangay health centers.”

“Yung Malasakit Centers they’re just really an upgrade to barangay health centers eh. What we need are health institutions or hospitals that can really serve the entire population or the entire community hindi yung mga intermediate services” he said.

Medical Reserves Corps Act — Pending

The creation of a Medical Reserve Corps (MRC) Act was one of Duterte’s priority bills in his penultimate SONA last year. It is pending at the Senate.

Once passed an MRC group under the DOH will be formed and will consist of medical student graduates and health professionals who will be called on times of crises to aid the national and local government.

Another provision in the proposed bill is the involvement of the Armed Forces of the Philippines who will provide expertise to the group for an “efficient swift and effective” deployment.

Calilung said the health sector was better left to experts in the field and that military involvement was unnecessary.

Creation of National Disease Prevention and Management Authority — Pending

Another legislative priority along with the MRC Act is the creation of a National Disease Prevention and Management Authority to prepare the country for any future health crises.

The proposal for such an agency is not new. Back in 2013 the late Sen. Miriam Defensor-Santiago filed Senate Bill 1573 or the “Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness” bill which had a similar premise.

Calilung noted that funding for infrastructure and facilities would be this bill’s greatest obstacle.

Printed copies of the measure were sent to members of Congress last July 14 as of this writing.

Advanced Nursing Education Act — Pending

Under this law higher education institutions will be required to have both basic and post-graduate education in the nursing programs. Both the Senate and House versions of the proposed law are currently being deliberated at the committee level.

The Advanced Nursing Education Act seeks to amend the Philippine Nursing Act of 2002 which only originally sought to provide a clear-cut and comprehensive definition of the nursing profession in the country.

Crime and national security

Revival of death penalty law — Pending

Since his campaign Duterte has been vocal about his interest in reviving the capital punishment for crimes related to drugs and corruption. He reiterated his call for its “swift passage” during his 2020 SONA.

However the proposition was met by contradicting opinions. The Catholic Bishop’s Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) and other religious organizations strongly opposed the re-imposition of the death penalty. The Commission on Human Rights (CHR) has also raised its concern in the issue saying that it could weaken the state’s “moral ground to plead for the lives of our OFWs (overseas Filipino workers) on death row.”

Senators like Manny Pacquiao and Ronald “Bato” Dela Rosa have been vocal on their support for the reinstatement of the death penalty. Pacquiao despite of religious background believes that death penalty would discourage individuals from committing heinous crimes.

Villarin said the reinstatement of death penalty was “not an easy legislation” despite Duterte having the support of a big majority in Congress.

“Filipinos remain conservative about death penalty” he said.

Calilung said Duterte’s remaining year as chief executive would not be sufficient for the administration to pass such a law.

“We cannot railroad it especially in a very short span of time especially all eyes and ears are geared toward the next election not to mention that we have the pandemic to contend with” he said.

Back in 2017 a bill reinstating the death penalty withstood the scrutiny of the lower chamber of the legislative but was turned down in the Senate.

Easing of Bank Secrecy Law — Pending

Duterte has yet to relax the country’s Bank Secrecy Law which is considered being among the strictest in the world and a safeguard for corrupt officials as it restricts public access to their bank accounts. Amendments are still at the committee level.

Yusingco said amending the provision would prove difficult as it would directly affect lawmakers and their self-interest.

Moreover he also cited an overall “lack of political will” from Duterte who had refused to publicize his Statement of Assets and Liabilities and Net Worth.

“The anti-corruption measures that we need are not successfully being pushed because lukewarm lang yung pag-promote nu’ng mga measure na ganun [the promotion of these measures]” Yusingco stressed.

Earlier this year Transparency International an independent organization that monitors corruption across the world placed the Philippines at the 118th spot out of 180 nations in the Corruption Perception Index. According to the study corruption in the Philippines worsened as the country was ranked at 99th the previous year due to the “stagnant” efforts to end corruption.

Anti-Terror Law — Enacted

More than a year ago now Duterte signed into law the controversial Anti-Terrorism Act which immediately received backlash from rights groups. More than 30 petitions against it have been filed before the Supreme Court.

The law would allow designated authorities to detain suspected terrorists for up to 24 days even without a warrant. The law was interpreted negatively by some lawmakers human-rights activists and legal experts citing that this could be used as a state weapon to suppress opposing ideas.

Yusingco said an anti-terrorism measure would only work if the community supported it — the opposite of what happened in the Anti-Terror Law.

“They should have gotten the public’s support first instead of fast-tracking it” he said.

Villarin believes that the provisions of the law were “generally good.” But the Constitution needs to align the country’s national security with the international standards of combating terrorism he said.

What’s next?

A focus on the remaining priority measures is what Duterte ultimately needs to convey in his final SONA political analysts said.

“[T]he SONA should actually have a special and exalted place wherein the president should only focus on the priority measures as well as in the case of this last SONA—how he will cement his legacy for the past six years” Calilung said.

“Political bickerings and small talk on politics particularly with his political opponents should not have a place anymore in his last SONA” he added.

Villarin said Duterte should also address all the allegations hurled against the administration to end his term “honorably.”

“Kailangan masagot yung mga tanong bumabalot sa kanyang administrasyon ([President Duterte] should answer the questions against his administration) particularly the accountability in the war on drugs” Villarin said citing for example the funds used in the drug-busting operations.

He said allegations of corruption and the West Philippine Sea dispute should also be addressed in his final speech.

As for Yusingco Duterte should give final directives on what the country would do to move forward from COVID-19.

“For [Duterte’s] last year we need him to focus on enacting the laws in his priority list. And the second thing is actually we need a president who will lay the foundation for the country moving forward from this pandemic” he said.

“Kailangan naka-focus ‘yung pangulo natin du’n sa aspeto na development natin (The president needs to focus on the aspect of our development). We need to move forward from this pandemic and a president who is engaged in politics will not be able to do that.”

MANILA – The Duterte administration is banking on key policy measures and reforms including those aimed at placing the Philippines in a strong position to weather the impact of the pandemic to boost recovery to achieve an upper middle-income country status by next year.

The Development Budget Coordination Committee (DBCC) retained its growth targets of 6 percent to 7 percent this year and 7 percent to 9 percent in 2022.

The Philippine economy shrank a record 9.5 percent in 2020 and posted a smaller contraction of 4.2 percent in the first quarter of 2021 but was expected to stage a strong recovery before the end of the year with the rollout of vaccines against coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19).

“This is a strong signal for the return to pre-pandemic or 2019 output levels by 2022. Growth will be driven by the government’s three-pillar strategy to accelerate economic recovery” Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Karl Kendrick Chua said in a reply to questions from the Philippine News Agency.

Chua said the three pillars that will govern economic recovery include the safe re-opening of the economy the implementation of the recovery program and the timely implementation of the government’s vaccine deployment program.

“Once the present spike is over the government will implement quarantine relaxations in a phased approach to boost our recovery this year. Over the near term the government will work towards moving NCR (National Capital Region) to MGCQ (modified general community quarantine) or better allow families and children to participate in the economy and restart face-to-face schooling” he said.

As of July 22 some 5560029 Filipinos have been fully vaccinated against coronavirus while 10866238 doses have been given as the first dose according to the National Task Force Against Covid-19.

Chua said the recovery program includes the PHP4.5-trillion fiscal year 2021 General Appropriations Act (GAA) the extended validity of the 2020 GAA and the implementation of the Corporate Recovery and Tax Incentives (CREATE) and Financial Institutions Strategic Transfer (FIST) laws.

The 2021 GAA aims to address the Covid-19 pandemic through health-related response programs and accelerate infrastructure development through the “Build Build Build” (BBB) infrastructure program.

“We are investing in a wide range of infrastructure projects. They are not only roads or airports but also health facilities also digital infrastructure --one of them is the National ID (identification). All of these are needed during this pandemic and our move to the new normal” Chua earlier said in a media briefing.

The National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) said seven projects amounting to PHP39.9 billion that were part of the infrastructure flagship project (IFP) list approved in 2017 2019 and 2020 have been completed.

On the current list of 112 IFPs that was confirmed by the NEDA Board last May 12 there are 17 projects amounting to PHP154.8 billion that are expected to be completed by June 2022 when Duterte’s term ends.

Key policy measures

Duterte last March 26 signed into law the CREATE Act that aims to attract more investments and maintain fiscal prudence and stability by introducing reforms to the corporate tax and incentives system.

The law ensures that the grant of tax incentives is performance-based targeted time-bound and transparent. It also reduces the corporate income tax rate by 5 to 10 percent for micro small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and other corporations.

Chua who is also NEDA chief said amid the global contraction of FDIs due to the Covid-19 pandemic CREATE will put the country in a better position to compete for investments. However the gains from CREATE will be limited if the government does not relax restrictions on foreign investments.

“To maximize the benefits from the enactment of CREATE we urge Congress to urgently pass the amendments to the Public Service Act the Foreign Investment Act and the Retail Trade Liberalization Act this year. These bills will complement CREATE by easing restrictions on foreign investments” he earlier said.

On the other hand the FIST Act enacted as Republic Act No. 11523 on February 16 this year seeks to encourage financial institutions to dispose of non-performing loans and assets to asset management companies by granting tax exemptions reduced registration and transfer fees.

The country also implemented the first and second Covid-19 response packages --the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act or Bayanihan I and Bayanihan to Recover as One Act (Bayanihan 2).

As of April 15 this year the Department of Budget and Management released a total of PHP646.97 billion to support the various projects activities and programs in response to the Covid-19 pandemic under the Bayanihan laws.

The government also released this year PHP22.9 billion for financial assistance to qualified beneficiaries in the NCR Plus placed under strictest enhanced community quarantine (ECQ).

Other reforms

Chua said other reforms have been enacted while some started implementation just before the pandemic hit.

“These proved to be useful in facilitating the transition to the new normal or in mitigating the adverse impacts of the quarantine restrictions implemented” he said.

These include the Ease of Doing Business and Efficient Government Service Delivery Act that aims to improve administrative efficiency in the public sector and a major reform in the agriculture sector which is the Rice Tariffication Law (RTL).

“By reducing processing time for government transactions this is expected to attract foreign and Filipino investors and entrepreneurs to start a business in the country” Chua said.

A long overdue reform that is designed to open the market for rice trade the RTL instead replaces the quantitative restrictions on imported rice with tariffs of 35 to 40 percent.

The law also establishes the Rice Competitiveness Enhancement Fund (RCEF) from the tariff revenues with an annual appropriation of PHP10 billion for six years to fund programs on farm mechanization seed development propagation and promotion credit assistance and extension services.

These will help improve the productivity of rice farmers reduce production costs and provide better linkages in the value chain.

The NEDA said the impact on consumers was evident as the retail price of rice went down by about 9 percent from 2018 to 2020.

The palay sub-sector meanwhile grew by 7.2 percent during the second quarter of 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019 amid the stringent quarantine restrictions.

Other reforms implemented are the Universal Health Care Act that aims to provide health care coverage to all Filipinos by reducing their financial burden and the Social Security Act of 2018 strengthening the Social Security System.

The latter also provides economic support to workers who have been involuntarily displaced.

The proposed economic liberalization bills such as the amendments to the Public Service Act Retail Trade Liberalization Act and Foreign Investment Act will also allow the country to better attract FDI and new technologies.

“It can create a more competitive environment to help ensure more affordable and reliable goods and services in the country. This is also expected to accelerate the digital transformation of the country” Chua said.

Meanwhile Chua said the Philippine Identification System (PhilSys) or the National ID program is on track to meet its target of 50 to 70 million registrations by the end of 2021 as over 38 million Filipinos have completed the initial step.

As of July 16 over 38.2 million individuals have finished Step 1 registration (collection of demographic data) and more than 19.3 million have finished Step 2 registration (biometric data collection). Over 524000 have already received their physical ID.

“Our objective here is to have 100-percent financial inclusion at the family level by the end of the year. So next year when we need to provide subsidies it will only (be) through bank accounts” Chua said adding that financial inclusion is among the priority use cases for the PhilSys.

Signed into law by President Rodrigo Duterte in August 2018 Republic Act 11055 or the PhilSys Act aims to establish a single national ID for all Filipinos and resident aliens.

The national ID shall be a valid proof of identity that shall be a means of simplifying public and private transactions enrollment in schools and the opening of bank accounts.

It will also boost efficiency especially in dealing with government services where people will only need to present one ID during transactions.

Upper middle-income country status

Chua said in a past briefing the country had targeted in 2022 the achievement of two important economic milestones --achieving an upper middle-income country (UMIC) status and lifting some six million Filipinos out of poverty.

Prior to Covid-19 the Philippines was expected to become a UMIC in 2020.

However the NEDA estimates that the Philippines may graduate to UMIC status around 2022 due to the pandemic.

As of July 1 2021 the World Bank defines upper middle-income economies as those with gross national income (GNI) per capita between USD4096 and USD12695. These thresholds are updated annually at the beginning of the Bank's fiscal year.

The Philippine GNI per capita reached USD3850 in 2019. (PNA)"

The broad-based index of energy agriculture industrial metals and precious metals rose the same amount as high-flying Bitcoin which pulled back after hitting its all-time high of more than $63000 on April 13.

Among the commodities we track West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil was the number one performer up nearly 52% on higher-than-expected demand and tight supply while precious metals lagged with silver down 1% and gold down more than 6%.

This represents a nearly complete reversal from the price action we saw in 2020. According to our Periodic Table of Commodity Returns precious metals were last year’s winners—silver surged close to 48% gold 25%—and oil was the big loser slipping as much as 20%.

But appetite for risk has changed now that huge segments of the economy are reopening. Demand for fuel has increased as Americans act on pent-up wanderlust: Earlier this month a greater number of people flew on commercial jets in the U.S. than on the same day in 2019 before the pandemic. And in the days leading up to the busy Fourth of July holiday weekend gas stations across the country were reportedly running out of gas.

After a Remarkable Turnaround Oil Demand Sets a New Record

The last six months were a profitable time to invest in the oilfield. The S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production Select Industry Index gained approximately 65%.

We participated with a number of companies including ConocoPhillips Valero Energy Phillips 66 and Halliburton among others. Earnings for the second quarter aren’t expected until next month but we believe investors will be pleased. In April Moody’s forecast that oil companies’ earnings may rise by a median rate of 50% compared to last year—though it’s worth noting that this is off a very low base.

Production companies should be well positioned going forward as long as they can maintain capital discipline and operating efficiency. Bloomberg reports that U.S. oil consumption hit a new record seasonally-adjusted high during the week ended July 2. “While gasoline and diesel demand have returned to pre-pandemic levels a surge in petroleum use for products such as plastic asphalt lubricants and other industrial needs is propelling the recovery” the article reads.

Gold Fundamentals Remain Solid

It’s no secret gold had a rough six months but a retrace of the bull market could be in the works due to strong fundamentals.

To me inflation is looking like a greater risk than Powell & Co. are admitting to publicly. Anyone who’s shopped for a new car in the past few months knows that prices are heading sharply up. The cost to eat out jumped 0.7% in June from the previous month the biggest such increase since January 1982. The producer price index (PPI) for final demand excluding volatile food and energy skyrocketed 5.6% compared to the same month last year representing the fastest pace since records began in 2011.

Investors seeking a haven may need to look elsewhere than government bonds. The 30-year Treasury yield currently trades below 2% even less when you factor in inflation meaning investors are effectively paying the U.S. government to hold its debt. As I said last month gold is the ultimate contrarian investment right now. The metal remains extremely undervalued compared to the S&P 500. The current climate definitely feels risk-on but I believe it’s only wise to hold around 10% in gold and gold mining stocks to help soften the impact of a worsening pandemic debt crisis or some other potential shock. I also recommend no more than a 1% to 2% allocation to Bitcoin and Ether as well as crypto mining stocks.

In step with the cancellation Plains All American Pipeline has requested state and federal agencies to revoke necessary permits for the Byhalia Connection — what would have been a 49-mile route connecting a refinery in Memphis to an oil terminal in northern Mississippi running through a series of majority-Black neighborhoods in Tennessee. The pipeline was a joint venture between Plains and Valero Energy Corporation.

As MLK50 reported shortly after the announcement developers have said that community members who received compensation can keep it. But as with the canceled Keystone XL and Atlantic Coast pipelines developers still retain indefinite rights to access parts of privately owned land along the canceled route.

Justin J. Pearson co-founder of Memphis Community Against the Pipeline (MCAP) told Truthout that having an out-of-state company continue to own land access is exploitative. “That’s another injustice on top of the injustice of having someone knock on your door and tell you if you don’t sell your land we’re going to sue you” he said referring to developers’ use of eminent domain in obtaining easements in low-wealth communities. “It’s violence upon people’s bodies and people’s souls having to be treated this way.”Anti-pipeline organizers around the country concur noting that the retaining of indefinite rights leaves the possibility of future disenfranchisement wide open.

“It’s a one-time payment for a lifetime of risk” Nebraska organizer Jane Kleeb told Truthout. Kleeb is the founding director of Bold Nebraska which helped lead opposition to the Keystone XL Pipeline. “There’s no reason why a pipeline company needs a forever-agreement” she said.

George Nolan a lawyer with the Southern Environmental Law Center who has represented MCAP and other community partners told Truthout a lawyer representing the cancelled project said they would consider requests to return easements to Memphis landowners who pay the company back on a “case-by-case” basis noting that it remained to be seen how the company planned to handle their control of easements in Mississippi.

“A problem with that approach by the pipeline company is that this happened during a pandemic and I’m presuming that many folks just may no longer have the money” Nolan said adding that in some cases compensation from the company may have gone to paying back taxes.

Representatives of Plains All American did not respond to Truthout’s requests for comment.

More Pipes More People Power

Fossil fuel interests have hurried to lay pipelines across the continent since 2015 when Congress lifted a 40-year export ban on oil. Sites of resistance to the ensuing construction have become physical and symbolic climate battlegrounds.

The victory by grassroots groups in Memphis opposing the Byhalia Pipeline on the grounds of environmental racism comes weeks after developers canceled the Keystone XL oil pipeline while the Biden administration continues to support the Line 3 pipeline in Minnesota. According to the Giniw Collective an Indigenous women and two-spirit-led anti-pipeline group on the frontlines of Line 3 resistance nearly 600 people have been arrested for civil disobedience in the fight against Line 3. Arrestees include seven Water Protectors who peacefully faced off against law enforcement to stop Enbridge from drawing water from the Shell River on July 19.

Opposition to the pipeline in Memphis began in early 2020 at a small gathering in a chapel full of mostly seniors who raised questions about the project because the proposed route ran through community members’ land. Residents worried the pipeline would threaten property values and the health of residents in historically Black neighborhoods along its route. Members of the Sierra Club and the local nonprofit Protect Our Aquifer also questioned the company’s process early on extensively researching which permits the company was pursuing and the degree to which the project threatened the Memphis Sand Aquifer a geologic formation near the most seismically active area east of the Rocky Mountains that provides drinking water to Memphis-area residents.

But it wasn’t until a younger generation of activists organized a community meeting at which MCAP was formed that the movement against the pipeline gained momentum drawing in Black landowners and allies from across the city and out of state.

Deb Carington a geologist from northern Mississippi who attended early Byhalia Pipeline-sponsored open houses on behalf of Protect Our Aquifer told Truthout that the formation of MCAP helped draw legal support including from the Southern Environmental Law Center and elevate the project to the national level. “[MCAP] brought tremendous energy and optimism that was huge for raising public awareness” Carrington said.

Pearson said as he and other activists learned about the permitting process they found it appalling that although there were environmental regulations protecting wetlands and bats in mating season there were none protecting the people living along a proposed route nor the groundwater from which they drink. Bedrock environmental laws like the Endangered Species Act require environmental assessments to be conducted if a proposed project stands to impact a specific set of endangered species. But regulators in charge of issuing permits the company pursued including a representative of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers explained in a letter to Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tennessee) that they did not have authority to deny the permit due to concerns over environmental justice or groundwater.

“Those regulatory gaps have real world implications on our lives” Pearson said noting that both of his grandmothers died of cancer in their sixties. “In the absence of any care about environmental racism or legacy pollution having no point where they get addressed is a perfect example of government-institutionalized racism.” The cancer rate in southwest Memphis is four times the U.S. average according to research by University of Memphis public health professor Chunrong Jia.

In April a coalition of environmental groups including MCAP sued the Army Corps for not properly evaluating the project’s impact on the environment when issuing a Nationwide 12 streamlined water-crossing permit as MLK50 reported. The case is pending in district court.

Closing Loopholes

Pearson and other members of the anti-pipeline coalition say they plan to reach out to and fundraise for residents who want their land rights back but may not be in a position to pay the company back particularly given economic hardship related to the ongoing pandemic. They’re also rallying support for a set of local ordinances that would prevent future underground infrastructure projects from encroaching on the city’s drinking water source and disproportionately threatening the health of Black migrant and low-income residents. The ordinances would fill what organizers describe as major loopholes in existing local state and federal permitting processes that were not designed to take environmental justice concerns into account.

One of the ordinances would create an underground infrastructure advisory board composed of city officials water experts and a community member with environmental justice expertise selected by the Memphis mayor and prohibit developers from building new infrastructure to transport hazardous liquids including oil without first obtaining a new permit from city council upon which the advisory board would issue a recommendation.

Approval of the permit would be contingent upon the project meeting a host of conditions such as environmental analysis of adverse impacts on groundwater distance from wells and the degree to which it might harm “minority populations low-income populations or neighborhoods historically burdened by environmental pollution.” The ordinance essentially aims to plug gaps in local state and federal permitting processes organizers say.

“You gotta do your due diligence that’s what we’re asking” Protect Our Aquifer Executive Director Sarah Houston said at a July 20 rally during which community members marched from the Civil Rights Museum to City Hall. The Memphis City Council voted swiftly to pass the ordinance after its first reading later that day. Two additional readings and votes are required before the ordinance becomes law; they are likely to be scheduled for later this summer or early fall.

But community members are wary of ongoing meddling by company interests. On July 5 just days after announcing the cancellation Cory Thornton a lawyer for Plains All American showed up at a city council meeting to oppose changes to city regulations as the Commercial Appeal reported. “In light of the cancellation of our project and the lack of logical technical or legal reasons to suggest that there is an existing danger to residents or to drinking water we urge the City Council not to pass the ordinance or setbacks. Even with modifications these ordinances will hurt the greater Memphis economy and area.”

A link on the Byhalia Connection website connects to another page Protect Memphis Jobs focused on opposing a second community-proposed ordinance that would require future pipelines to be set back 1500 feet at minimum from homes or places of worship. The site deems the ordinance “legally flawed” and lists the American Petroleum Institute Consumer Energy Alliance and the Tennessee Chamber of Commerce along with Plains All American and Byhalia Pipeline as sponsors of the campaign.

Memphis organizers also expressed concerns that developers may be planning an alternate route and say they’ll continue to build “people power” across state lines in Arkansas and Mississippi.

“The culture has its eyes on Memphis and will take note whether the city council will act to protect Black lives or aid in their demise” Rev. Lennox Yearwood Jr. founder of the Hip Hop Caucus co-wrote in the Commercial Appeal. “As we move forward in Memphis and prepare for future battles that will eventually come we call on city leaders to fill regulatory gaps and pass ordinances now that would prevent similar pipeline projects from threatening the city’s water supply and most vulnerable communities.

The anti-pipeline movement nationwide is ultimately about pushing to avert the climate emergency.

Meanwhile Kleeb of Bold Nebraska said she’s concerned about a relatively new threat — that TC Energy may later use or sell the easements they still own along the canceled Keystone XL route to build compressed carbon pipelines as part of a future carbon-capture network. Nebraska lawmakers recently passed a bill that encourages the development of technology including pipelines to capture emissions from industrial sites and whisk them away to be stored below ground. She worries the use of eminent domain for carbon capture infrastructure could replicate historic injustices while allowing polluting industries to continue to profit. While there’s no indication of such plans in Memphis Kleeb notes that these systems are likely to be further incentivized by funds allotted for carbon capture in the hotly debated infrastructure bill. “Now we have to get laws in place to protect future landowners and fix the wrongs of the current situation” she said. Kleeb is working to pass legislation at the state and federal level that would require developers to return easements to landowners in the event that a project is canceled.

Amid the backdrop of this summer’s record temperatures fatal floods and mammoth fires Pearson noted that the anti-pipeline movement nationwide is ultimately about pushing to avert the climate emergency which is generating conditions for a sixth mass extinction  by eliminating projects that exploit communities with fewer resources and lead to the release of greenhouse gases. At the end of the day according to Pearson “Racist policies and a capitalistic system is what’s really fueling climate change.”

Former President Donald Trump arrived at the Arizona Federal Theatre on Saturday as the state Senate continues a months-long review of the 2020 Maricopa County ballots.

Most of the Republicans competing in the 2022 Arizona gubernatorial and U.S. Senate primary races were in attendance at the theater on Saturday.

The event hosted by Turning Point Action a Phoenix-based political organization headed by conservative Charlie Kirk gave Republicans an opportunity to pitch their candidacies.

But many of those in attendance wanted to know if Trump will run for president in 2024.

Trump headlined the event with a ""Rally to Protect Our Elections.""

Follow coverage of the Trump rally by Republic reporters here.

6:30 p.m.: Trump supporters: We’re not what people say we are

Martel Salas 19 traveled to Phoenix from California to attend the rally with his brother and had been at the theatre since 7:30 a.m.

For him this was a fun event.

Salas said he’s always been a big fan of Charlie Kirk and that seeing him was the highlight of the rally in addition to Trump.

Salas said Kari Lake was his favorite Arizona candidate because she “gave everyone such good energy.”

“All Trump supporters aren’t like what people say they are never have been. And they’re not all only white people” Salas said.

Jessica Valero 22 and Elizabeth Valero 26 attended the rally with their mom and younger brother. The sisters said they came to the event from east Mesa to see Trump speak and enjoyed the rally.

Trump’s speech “was great” Jessica Valero said adding that she was also exhausted.

The sisters said they support Trump because they do not want the U.S. to become a communist country.

“I want to keep my rights” said Elizabeth Valero. “I don’t want anything getting in the way of that because little by little it will be communist … America is the land of opportunity.”

The former president wrapped up his remarks with his signature closing: ""We will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again.""

5:45 p.m.: Protester speaks out against Trump voting restrictions

Keith Edmonson 60 a Gilbert resident walked around the Arizona Federal Theatre with a GoPro wearing a shirt that read “My black life and vote matters” and “U can’t dismiss killing unarmed black men"" as Trump addressed the crowd in the venue.

Edmonson said he wanted to film himself outside the venue in protest of Trump and the election audit in Maricopa County.

“I want people to see the American experience” he said. “We all can have our dislikes we can have our grievances but this is America — the right to come and demonstrate the right to support your candidate no matter how failed he may be but it’s your right to do that.”

Edmonson said he wants to leave his “grievance” against Trump who Edmonson believes has done “so much harm against America” and “against Black America"" at the venue.

""This man this state is disenfranchising disqualifying and invalidating my vote right now” he said. “What they’re saying is that I don’t count.

“Even if I can’t get in the fact that I’m able to just say what I need to say about him out loud in the air I’m still able to leave my complaint” he said.

5 p.m.: Trump repeats false Arizona audit claims

Donald Trump repeated many of the claims the state Senate’s auditors made last week about the Maricopa County 2020 election which he lost.

Among them was the claim that ""74000 mail-in ballots were counted with no clear record of them being sent” he said. “Nobody knows where the hell they are.”

But county elections officials have said the claim is rooted in misinformation.

They say the Cyber Ninjas the Senate’s auditors did not understand the way early ballots are tracked. The county keeps two files that must record returned ballots at different points in time. These votes are later are combined into one “voted file” document. Anyone looking at just one of those files would not get the full picture.

For example people who voted early after Oct. 23 are listed in one file; that includes voters who cast a provisional ballot on election day. Another file tracks people who brought their early ballot back to the polls on election day. When they are combined they add up to 74000.

3:53 p.m.: Trump takes the stage attacks Gov. Ducey

After a short introduction by Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk Donald Trump walked onstage with Lee Greenwood's ""God Bless the U.S.A."" playing.

Trump immediately nodded to the ongoing Maricopa County ballot review and hailed several Republican Arizona senators while taking shots at Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey and U.S. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell R-Ky.

“We’re gathered here in Phoenix to show our support for election integrity and for the brave and unyielding conservative warriors in the Arizona State Senate – thank you” Trump said. “They’ve created a movement all over the country.”

Trump said he has heard that even Texas now wants to do an election audit which he said he supports despite having carried the state.

Trump lavished praise on several state senators including Arizona Senate President Karen Fann Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Warren Petersen and Sens. J.D. Mesnard Kelly Townsend Nancy Barto Sonny Borrelli Vince Leach and Wendy Rogers.

“She's been brave. She’s been strong” Trump said of Fann. “And I predict when the votes come in … I think they are going to be so horrible that she’s going to go three steps further than she ever thought she’d have to. Because they will be in my opinion and again I’m not involved they’re involved this is the Arizona State Senate I think the results are going to be so outrageous … that they are going to go many steps further than they would have.”

Trump also hailed as having “tremendous courage” Arizona Republican Party chair Kelli Ward a close ally of Trump’s in the state.

“She’s really a fighter and she fights your governor who doesn’t do a damn thing” Trump said in a slam of Ducey who Trump has been relentlessly critical of since last year’s election.

“They came to see me they said ‘Sir would you like him to run for the Senate?’ And I said he’s not getting my endorsement I can tell you” Trump said.

Trump likewise heaped scorn on McConnell whom he called “the Old Crow.”

3:30 p.m.: The warm-up: Governor candidates talk

Toward the beginning of the hours-long rally Republican candidates for governor made their pitches.

Former TV newscaster Kari Lake was the hands-down favorite; the crowd cheered as she approached the podium and chanted “Kari Kari” before she even started speaking.

Lake called herself an “unapologetic Trump Republican” and raised a cheer for MAGA country.

“The pendulum is swinging and is going to come back as a wrecking ball” Lake said predicting a reversal of GOP fortunes in the 2022 election.

She then ran through a list of red-meat issues urging the crowd to ignore traditional media — “Turn it off” — she said and bashing COVID-19 restrictions.

“They’re about to push more COVID restrictions on us” she warned. “We’re not going to fall for it. Pastors don’t shut your churches down. Mothers don’t let them make us mask our children again.”

Lake’s speech was preceded by State Treasurer Kimberly Yee who promised fair elections and touted her anti-abortion stance as a state lawmaker.

“I am running for governor because I am pro-life” she said.

She closed her talk by asking the crowd to donate not to her campaign but to donaldjtrump.com to “save America.”

Businessman Steve Gaynor suggested election trickery denied him a win in the 2018 race for Arizona Secretary of State noting he was leading on election night but two weeks later after all the ballots were counted Democrat Katie Hobbs had won. There has been no evidence that there were irregularities in that race.

After that race Gaynor said he told the “Arizona swamp” that election reform was needed but no one listened. Now he said “There are 1 million Republicans in our state who believe the 2020 election was rigged.”

He supported the ongoing audit of the 2020 Maricopa County election noting that audits are routinely done of businesses and by the IRS but no one calls those exercises “fraudits.”

Matt Salmon echoed support for the audit in his speech as the final GOP gubernatorial candidate.

He punctuated his speech with loud almost growling cheers for freedom and calling Arizona “Trump country.”

He touted his role as the founder of the congressional Freedom Caucus when he served as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives.

Carmen Stacy a Scottsdale resident of six years waited in line several blocks away from the entrance of the venue at about noon. He said he came to the rally to “support the guy who called out all the fake news all the fake hypocrisy with everything.”

“Anybody that has a brain” would want Trump to run for president in 2024 Stacy said.

He was hoping to see Charlie Kirk in addition to Trump he said. This is the second Trump rally in Phoenix that Stacy said he has tried to attend.

As they waited in line close to the entrance Mardi and Mickey Keilman said they’re big supporters of Trump and Arizona gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake.

“We like both of their policies” Mardi Keilman said. “We’re in desperate need to secure our borders. What are we supposed to do with all these people?” Stopping the border wall censorship “big tech” and drug issues are some of the topics the Keilmans said they care about the most.

“We feel our country has gone to hell since Biden has become president” Mardi Keilman said.

Both Mardi and Mickey Keilman said people should also “stop listening to the fake news” and mainstream media. “I don’t care if they say something bad about conservatives and Trump but make it accurate” Mickey Keilman said.

Doug Everett 57 and Scott Barrett 33 said they traveled from Tucson to be at the Trump rally.

The two friends said they want “justice to be served” for the election being stolen.

“The thing about the election is there were legitimate concerns” Barrett said. “Trump did say ‘We did what we could’ and he was right. Biden got in there on a fraudulent election.”

Both Everett and Barrett said they want to see Trump run for president in 2024. Barrett also said it may even be “crucial for one of his sons or daughter to run.”

Everett and Barrett also said that they support the election audit of the Maricopa County ballots. Arizona has the best chance to “overturn a fraudulent claim” Barrett said.

Countless red Make America Great Again hats bobbed up and down in a sea of bodies as the line of supporters hoping to get in wrapped around the building.

The crowd displayed shirts signs and flags denouncing a stolen election and vaccine hoax that have become conservative talking points since Biden took office.

About 15 to 20 vendors of pro-Trump merchandise were in the area hoping to make a sale.

John Williams drove 31 hours from North Carolina to sell Trump merchandise including shirts hats and flags outside of the rally. He said today was pretty slow for his table near the end of the line with most people already having their Trump gear in hand.

Closer to the entrance Franklin Hughes was having better success selling his inventory. Hughes has been working Trump events since 2016 and has traveled to 48 states in the last year selling his merchandise he said.

Since the election his business has slowed but “sales are picking back up” Hughes said.

State Sen. Michelle Ugenti-Rita was booed off the stage as she started to make her pitch for Arizona secretary of state. “Listen up!” she said as the crowd noise began to rise.

They didn’t. As she tried to plow through her stump speech the cries of disapproval continued. She finally gave up leaving the stage after telling the crowd that she will win the race.

Ugenti-Rita is one of three Republicans who is running for secretary of state and all were given time to speak at the Rally to Protect Our Elections.

State Rep. Shawnna Bolick said she is running to depoliticize the office and raced through a list of election-related legislation that passed this year. Those bills passed with only Republican votes with all Democrats opposed.

The third candidate Rep. Mark Finchem R-Oro Valley was not present. Moderator Justin Olson said Finchem was in Michigan “fighting for election integrity measures.”

Republican Beau Lane is also running for the GOP nomination for secretary of state but he apparently was not invited to speak at the rally.

Three of the four Republicans hoping to challenge Sen. Mark Kelly D-Ariz. took turns jabbing the former astronaut and praising former President Donald Trump.

The nearly 5000 in attendance didn’t show any clear preference for any of the three all of whom are political newcomers.

Michael ""Mick"" McGuire the retired adjutant general of the Arizona National Guard said President Joe Biden has been “derelict in his duty” to protect the border.

He said Trump doesn’t get credit for the expedited development of vaccines for the coronavirus and called for a return to prioritizing construction of a wall along the border with Mexico.

McGuire said the “Big Lie” in America is that the nation’s election system works properly.

Solar power company executive Jim Lamon said he plans to send Kelly back to his summer home in Beijing.

Lamon described his business as a billion-dollar enterprise with 1600 workers many of whom are veterans.

He promised to be an America-first senator.

Lamon said he was a Trump elector for Arizona last year and supports the ongoing ballot review and has “since Day One.”

Lamon promised that if elected to the Senate he wouldn’t take a salary or a pension.

Blake Masters the financial aide to billionaire Peter Thiel attacked Democrats as a party trying to bring about socialism drawing howls from some that they are “Communists.”

Masters warned that the technology giants are a threat to democracy and said he would seek to break up Google and Facebook.

He also called for a ban on what is known as critical race theory the idea that racism is systemic.

Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich did not attend citing a family commitment. Trump has blasted Brnovich for not supporting the ballot review to his liking.

A small group of protesters was creating a scene Saturday afternoon toward the front of the line as Trump supporters periodically engaged in arguments.

The Phoenix police department’s community engagement bureau was monitoring the crowd and was keeping the peace between animated people.

Doors to the venue closed at 1 p.m. The remaining people in line about 200 to 300 were notified the building was at capacity and started spreading out around the venue.

— Lacey Latch

Doors opened at the Arizona Federal Theatre at around 9:30 a.m. for about 1000 people donning MAGA hats and red white and blue waiting in line according to volunteer organizers.

By noon a few hundred people continued to wait in line in hopes of attending the rally. By 12:30 p.m. people continued filling the venue.

Food vendors and booths selling merchandise like Trump 2024 hats lined the corners of intersections around the venue.

Organizers said people started camping to wait in line on Friday night.

Police blocked several streets near the venue and officers stood next to police vehicles as people waited in line.

There didn’t appear to be any protesters at or near the event on Saturday afternoon.

A series of tweets Saturday morning suggested Michelle Witthoeft the mother of the woman shot to death by police as she climbed through a barricaded door during the U.S. Capitol riot will be speaking at the rally.

Rep. Paul Gosar R-Ariz. has repeatedly suggested the woman Ashli Babbitt was “murdered” by the police officer and has sought to identify the man who shot her.

In a tweet from his personal account Gosar on Saturday said he looked forward to meeting Witthoeft and noted “God bless you. God bless Ashli.”

It was in response to a tweet from an account with Witthoeft’s name on it. On Friday Witthoeft’s account noted that “I have been invited by congressman Gosar to speak at the Trump rally tomorrow.”

Witthoeft’s account prominently asks “Who killed my child?”

Gosar who was a leading voice in Congress promoting the false narrative of a stolen election also has been prominent in the effort to recast the deadly Jan. 6 riot as a peaceful protest.

Cellphone footage from those near Babbitt showed her climbing through the opening in a glass window of a door that was locked and barricaded. With dozens of rioters behind her Babbitt continued even as police instructed the crowd to stop.

The events of Jan. 6 have become another flashpoint of partisan division.

A Capitol police officer who had been involved in the violent struggle to turn back the mob died the day after the riot and his death was immediately blamed on the attack. An autopsy revealed that he had suffered two strokes and died of natural causes.

The shifting account contributed to what some conservatives viewed as an overblown effort to blame them for the attack.

Democrats sought a bipartisan commission to investigate what led to the effort to press Congress not to certify the results of the 2020 presidential election. That failed because of Republican resistance in the Senate.

Some Republicans said any inquiry should also look at the role of social unrest last year after the death of George Floyd.

Instead Democrats in the House are now leading a panel filled mostly with Democrats to examine the causes of the Jan. 6 riot.

Four Republican contenders for the governor's race were expected to participate in the candidate forum before former President Donald Trump takes the stage.

They are: businessman Steve Gaynor; former local TV news anchor Kari Lake; former U.S. Rep. Matt Salmon; and state Treasurer Kimberly Yee.

Republican U.S. Reps. Andy Biggs Paul Gosar and Debbie Lesko were expected to speak as well.

The counting of Maricopa County ballots from November was expected to continue Saturday the day after water leaks during an afternoon thunderstorm caused workers to scramble to protect them.

Workers quickly moved ballot boxes away from the leaks inside the Wesley Bolin Building as the rain poured outside.

Randy Pullen representing the Arizona Senate Republicans who ordered the election review said no ballots were damaged and they are protected from the leaks. Workers covered boxes with tarps to protect them he said.

""No ballots are at risk"" he said.

The Bolin building is a non-air conditioned exhibit hall at the south side of the fairgrounds property near the cattle barns. It is normally used for trade shows.

The months-long review of the election began on April 23 in the Arizona Veterans Memorial Coliseum.

In advance of his scheduled Phoenix rally on Saturday Donald Trump took aim at an Arizona senator who has been critical of the election audit that Trump inspired.

The former president issued a news release on Thursday criticizing Sen. Paul Boyer R-Glendale for doing ""everything in his power to hold up the damning forensic audit of Maricopa County.""

To which Boyer tweeted a reply noting Trump's failure to build the border wall and his role in instigating the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.

Boyer told The Arizona Republic he had no idea what inspired the former president's comments.

Boyer is not holding up the audit as Trump charged. The effort at the state fairgrounds is entering its fourth month and the initial hand count of nearly 2.1 million Maricopa County ballots has been completed by the Senate's contractor the Cyber Ninjas.

Boyer said the audit is playing out as a misdirected partisan effort.

“I’ve always been a supporter of a legitimate audit"" he told The Republic. ""This is illegitimate.”

Por medio de un decreto presidencial el país andino dio luz verde a las ventas externas de este insumo y a la expansión de las ventas de medicamentos a base de cannabis como un paso más para desarrollar esta incipiente industria.

Colombia ha sido pionera en la regulación de la posesión producción y distribución de derivados del cannabis como por ejemplo sustancias como aceites o cremas. Pero los inversionistas se han quejado por años del tortuoso proceso de aprobación de exportaciones.

El presidente de Colombia Iván Duque firmó este viernes 23 de julio un decreto que autoriza la exportación de la flor seca de cannabis con fines medicinales para brindar más incentivos a la industria farmacéutica y garantizar el acceso de medicamentos derivados de la planta.

Queremos que la industria de cannabis medicinal se convierta en uno de los motores de desarrollo exportador de nuestro país y es por eso que gracias al arduo trabajo en equipo hoy podemos decir que Colombia tiene la mejor regulación de América Latina y el Caribe de este sector pic.twitter.com/r8Ukbcrsjn — Iván Duque 🇨🇴 (@IvanDuque) July 23 2021

El decreto también permite la expansión de las ventas de medicamentos a base de cannabis y agiliza los procedimientos regulatorios.

""Esto significa que Colombia puede entrar a jugar un papel importante en el mercado internacional"" aseveró Duque luego de firmar el decreto agregando que las nuevas reglas permitirían a la industria colombiana del cannabis expandirse en sectores como cosméticos alimentos y bebidas entre otros.

Según el Gobierno colombiano este es un mercado que ""para el año 2024 estará en alrededor de los 6.200 millones de dólares"" por lo que autorizar la exportación de la flor seca de cannabis ""permitirá crecer las inversiones que han llegado al país y que superan los 250 millones de dólares"".

En países donde la industria del cannabis medicinal tiene una regulación más madura como Estados Unidos Reino Unido Alemania e Israel entre otros el cannabis seco es el sector más desarrollado del mercado representando más del 50% de todas las ventas.

“Te puedo decir nuestras ventas si han bajado considerablemente a un 50% esto se ha dado ha raíz de toda esta situación de emergencia sanitaria las restricciones en los aforos una situación económica bastante mala y más que nada las clases en línea nos están afectando mucho. Lo que más se vendía antes era por la cuestión de los niños pero más que nada las escuelas con sus clases presenciales la escuela es la que hace que tengamos mayores ventas en el negocio”.

Municipios Servicio ""sólo para llevar"" reduce ventas en puesto de birria

A pesar de los esfuerzos para continuar con los protocolos nuevas restricciones sanitizar los negocios de manera continua mucha gente ha dejado de acudir a muchos de los negocios ubicados en zona Centro ante el miedo a los posibles contagios: “Mucha gente siento yo que todavía se reserva para venir al Centro ahora con lo de los altos contagios aún más. De repente se llevan juegos de mesa pero ya no llevan tanto como antes para las tareas escolares y es debido a eso también la falta de las escuelas abiertas”.

“No es lo mismo que las clases sean en los salones de clases de manera presencial tampoco hubo los vales de útiles escolares ni nada de eso. También horita mucha gente no tiene ni trabajo menos va a tener para comprar cosas de la escuela de manera virtual. Yo ya tengo 29 años trabajando en el negocio pero este negocio tiene 66 años desde que inicio fue una de las primeras mercerías de aquel tiempo también era otra situación las ventas si eran muy buenas en ese tiempo”.

Este tipo de negocios eran necesarios ante la demanda de productos necesarios para los trabajos dentro de las escuelas. “Ha durado el negocio son artículos que realmente la gente necesitaba como la papelería la mercería o detallitos a pesar de las empresas grandes aquí seguimos trabajando”.

En los últimos ocho años el club alemán ha ingresado 5437 millones por ellos. Unas cifras que indican que el Dortmund tiene un ojo clínico para detectar a jugadores jóvenes en su mayoría desconocidos y hacer de ellos unas auténticas estrellas mundiales que terminan siendo el objeto de deseo de los grandes clubes del fútbol europeo.

El Dortmund se ha vuelto a hacer de oro en este mercado de fichajes. La venta de Sancho al United por 85 millones supone el fichaje más caro en lo que va del mercado estival y también la segunda venta más alta en la historia de la Bundesliga según los datos que maneja la web especializada en fichajes Transfermarkt. En los últimos ocho años el club alemán ha sabido rentabilizar a la perfección el gran rendimiento ofrecido por los puntales de su equipo. Jugador desconocido que fichan jugador que pulen hasta convertirlo en uno de renombre para luego sacar la mayor tajada económica a los clubes compradores.

El punto culminante del trabajo realizado por el área deportiva del Signal Iduna Park estos años llegó con la venta de Ousmane Dembélé al Barcelona en 2017 por una cifra récord: 135 millones cuando el extremo francés apenas le costó al Dortmund en su día 35 millones. Tras Dembélé la segunda mejor venta es la de Sancho. Pulisic (64 millones) Aubameyang (637 millones) y Mkhitaryan (42 millones) completan el top 5 de las mejores ventas realizadas por el Dortmund. Les sigue el canterano más rentable de la historia de la entidad Mario Götze que marchó al Bayern de Múnich en 2013 por 37 millones. Por último cierran la lista Matt Hummels (35 millones) el joven Abdou Diallo (32 millones) Ikai Gündogan (27 millones) y Paco Alcácer (23 millones). Por si fuera poco el Dortmund tiene en un futuro la oportunidad de consolidarse como el rey del mercado ya que Haaland junto con Mbappé es el jugador que toda Europa se rifa en estos momentos.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovL2RlcG9yLmNvbS9mdXRib2wtaW50ZXJuYWNpb25hbC9hbGVtYW5pYS9maWNoYWplcy1ib3J1c3NpYS1kb3J0bXVuZC1jb24tamFkb24tc2FuY2hvLWxhcy0yMC12ZW50YXMtbWFzLWNhcmFzLWRlLXN1LWhpc3RvcmlhLWZvdG9zLW5vdGljaWEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Una 'máquina' de hacer dinero: con Sancho las 20 ventas más caras en la historia del Dortmund [FOTOS],Una ‘máquina’ de hacer dinero: con Sancho las 20 ventas más caras en la historia del Dortmund [FOTOS]

“Hearst Magazines and Verizon Media may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.”

If you’ve been watching Disney+’s latest Marvel series Loki you probably noticed the imposing modern architecture of the fictional Time Variance Authority Building wherein Loki is held following an arrest for altering the set timelines of the universe (as one does). As it turns out you can actually visit and stay at the TVA Building in real life as it’s actually a Marriott hotel located in Atlanta Georgia.

Outside of the Marvel Universe  this 50-story building is known as the Atlanta Marriott Marquis a 4-star hotel that happens to be the 14th tallest skyscraper in all of the Big Peach. And if it looks familiar you may have also seen it in The Hunger Games: Catching Fire and The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1 in which it acted as the Capitol’s tribute center. It even made an appearance in Spider-Man: Homecoming another Marvel production.

Designed by Atlanta architect John C. Portman Jr.—who designed numerous hotels for Marriott Hyatt and Westin throughout his career—the Atlanta Marriott Marquis is sometimes referred to as the “Coca Cola Building” and the “Pregnant Building” because of its protruding base. When this building’s construction was completed in 1985 its 470 foot-high atrium was the largest in the world as it expands to the highest point of the building. It held this title until the 1990s when the Burj Al Arab—a luxury hotel in Dubai—was completed.

If that wasn’t impressive enough this 1663-room hotel cost $150 million to construct and it boasts numerous restaurants and bars including the Sear Restaurant High Velocity Pulse a pool bar and a Starbucks. Additionally the Atlanta Marriott Marquis will host the annual Dragon Con this September—as it typically does—which is the largest multi-media convention in existence with a focus on comics gaming science fiction art music literature and film.

The airline industry dominated the earnings scene this week with United Airlines reporting results on Tuesday and Southwest Airlines and American Airlines releasing their second-quarter statements on Thursday. Earlier IBM came out with positive numbers for its most recent quarter on Monday. The next day all eyes were on streaming giant Netflix which published mixed results in the after-hours.

Energy firm Kinder Morgan Seagate Technology Verizon soft drink major Coca-Cola and Johnson & Johnson stole the show on Wednesday. Thursday was as busy as usual with the major events being the second-quarter earnings releases of telecom firm AT&T fast-food chain Domino’s Pizza Biogen Abbott Laboratories Intel as well as social networking platforms Twitter and Snap. Schlumberger American Express and Kimberly-Clark reported Friday before the opening bell.

While Lockheed Martin is probably the only major company to report earnings on July 26 the market will be closely following the report of Alphabet on July 27. The Google parent will be joined by gadget giant Apple chipmaker AMD Starbucks and Microsoft in the after-hours. Before the opening bell aviation firm JetBlue and engineering behemoth General Electric are scheduled to report earnings.

The financial releases of Bristol-Myers Squibb aircraft builder Boeing and Ford Motor are the key events slated for July 28. The next day is going to be as hectic when the earnings announcements of e-commerce giant Amazon.com Altria Group Yum! Brands and Merck & Co. are on tap.

Now the US government says it’s looking for ways to beam uncensored internet access into Cuba.

On July 21 a State Department official confirmed that the Biden administration is “working with the private sector & Congress to identify ways to make the internet more accessible to the Cuban people.” A day earlier White House press secretary Jen Psaki told the South Florida local news station WPBF that restoring internet access in Cuba is a priority for president Joe Biden. “That isn’t easy” Psaki said. “But he’s going to look for ways working with his team to expand ways to do that or see what our options are.”

There are plenty of proposals from Cuban-American activists Florida politicians and members of the Federal Communications Commission for how the US might undermine Havana and connect Cubans to the web. The federal government could clear the regulatory hurdles that prevent Elon Musk from using his satellite network to beam broadband down from space. The government could muster decommissioned hot air balloons from Google’s Loon project to position floating cell towers in the stratosphere above Cuba. The US military could turn its naval base at Guantanamo Bay into a massive wifi hotspot.

Yet daunting technical roadblocks severely limit their potential to bring the free and open web to many Cubans.

For decades countries like the US ran programs like Radio Free Europe which broadcast news and entertainment to radio listeners living under the censorship of the Soviet Union. The US has run a similar program for Cuba under the name Radio Martí (named after Cuban independence hero José Martí) since 1985. The broadcasts—much like today’s proposals for a guerilla internet network in Cuba—aim to give citizens access to a broader range of information and empower them to challenge their rulers.

But the internet is not radio. It requires more advanced equipment and a stronger two-way connection between users and telecommunication networks. Transmitting web content isn’t as easy as firing off a pirate radio broadcast from a boat in international waters.

This helps illustrate why liberal democracies around the world won’t be able to just beam in uncensored internet every time an authoritarian regime cuts its citizens’ access to the web. If the US can’t pull it off in Cuba—a country 90 miles away which sits within range of some American telecommunications systems and hosts a major US military base—it’s hard to imagine any government or company doing the same in a harder-to-reach region like China’s Xinjiang province.

Google Loons deflated

Florida governor Ron DeSantis has been pushing the White House to consider using hot air balloons to connect Cuba to the web—and Biden has reportedly been considering DeSantis’s pitch. This plan borrows from Google’s now-defunct Loon project which for a decade used high-altitude weather balloons to float internet equipment into the stratosphere above areas with spotty web connections.

Loon successfully brought internet service to mountainous regions of Kenya and to Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria downed much of the country’s mobile network. But the balloons can’t provide internet service all by themselves—they can only extend the range of existing telecom networks into hard-to-reach areas. At some point they need to connect with terrestrial networks.

Cuba’s state-run ETECSA internet network obviously is unlikely to connect with the balloons. While American telecom networks in nearby South Florida could provide connectivity US mobile networks from companies like AT&T and Verizon aren’t compatible with the SIM cards in most Cubans’ phones which are configured for the ETECSA network.

Moreover the balloons need unfettered access to a range of radio frequencies to transmit web data down to people on the ground. The Cuban government could jam those radio signals to scramble any connections between its citizens and the balloons.

Could Starlink satellites send internet from space?

A second idea is to offer web access in Cuba from space using SpaceX’s satellite network Starlink. The satellites act as relays between people in remote locations and ground stations that are connected to the web via fiber optic cables. If you’re close enough to a web-connected ground station—and you have a satellite phone or a computer connected to a satellite dish—you could use Starlink to get online.

Fortunately much of Cuba’s landmass does appear to be within range of at least one Starlink station in Punta Gorda Florida. Unfortunately it’s exceedingly unlikely that many Cubans have a satellite phone or a Starlink satellite dish. The government tightly controls access to that sort of equipment and harshly punishes foreigners who attempt to smuggle it into the country.

There’s also a legal hurdle: Transmitting the internet into a country against the will of its government is a violation of international law. There’s not much the Cuban government could do to sanction SpaceX CEO Elon Musk if he ever did choose to start a pirate internet broadcast because he doesn’t do any business in Cuba. But in other countries like China authoritarian regimes have much more economic leverage over businessmen like Musk that might make them think twice before challenging the government’s internet censorship.

Guantanamo wifi hotspot

DeSantis also suggested that the US could take advantage of the territory it controls in Cuba—namely the US embassy in Havana and the military base at Guantanamo Bay—to create wifi hotspots. There are however some very sharp limitations on this idea. Wifi hotspots have a limited range that tops out around 50 yards so Cubans would have to physically cluster around the embassy or base to use the internet.

Wilnis a kickboxing veteran who holds a controversial unanimous decision win over Israel Adesanya from January 2017 put on the MMA gloves for his first professional bout on Sunday and all went well.

Headlining Levels Fight League 2 in Amsterdam Wilnis made relatively easy work of Erhan Okuroglu for a first-round knockout. After thwarting a number of takedown attempts Wilnis slid a strong right hand though Okuroglu’s guard that put him in trouble setting up a left hook that dropped him to the mat. It was stopped moments thereafter at the 4:08 mark of Round 1.

Check out the replay of Wilnis’ win below (via Twitter):

Although it didn’t come against particularly proven competition Wilnis’ performance was a good start. The 30-year-old Dutchman told MMA Junkie pre-fight that he’s wholly committed to making a run in the sport and after gaining experience hopes to land in the UFC or Bellator.

Despite having faced and beaten Adesanya under the GLORY banner Wilnis said he’s not trying to use the kickboxing victory as a shortcut to success in MMA. He would like nothing more than to face Adesanya against in a cage but won’t be chasing it.

“I’ve seen his rise through the UFC and I would be lying if I didn’t say that was somewhat of a motivation for me” Wilnis said of Adesanya. “But my thoughts on MMA started before him. If I get to the UFC and our paths cross I would fight him again for sure. However I am on my own journey and I would not say fighting him is a particular goal of mine.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5hbHBoYXN0cmVldC5jb20vZWFybmluZ3MtY2FsZW5kYXItZm9yLXRoZS13ZWVrLW9mLWp1bHktMjYv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Earnings calendar for the week of July 26,"After showing weakness at the beginning of the week benchmark stock indexes made steady gains even as economic recovery gathered steam. On Friday the S&P 500 index crossed the 4400-mark for the first time while the Dow Jones Industrial Average moved past 35000 and reached a new high. Meanwhile weekly jobless claims increased unexpectedly to around 419000 dampening hopes of labor market recovery.

Continuing its buyout spree Accenture bought two technology companies early this week — Toronto-based Oracle cloud service provider Cloudworks and workforce optimization consultancy Workforce Insight – and completed the previously announced acquisition of France-based cybersecurity firm Openminded.

In another tech deal Microsoft agreed to acquire security start-up CloudKnox. Meanwhile Visa clinched a deal to buy Currencycloud for about 700 million pounds.

The airline industry dominated the earnings scene this week with United Airlines reporting results on Tuesday and Southwest Airlines and American Airlines releasing their second-quarter statements on Thursday. Earlier IBM came out with positive numbers for its most recent quarter on Monday. The next day all eyes were on streaming giant Netflix which published mixed results in the after-hours.

Energy firm Kinder Morgan Seagate Technology Verizon soft drink major Coca-Cola and Johnson & Johnson stole the show on Wednesday. Thursday was as busy as usual with the major events being the second-quarter earnings releases of telecom firm AT&T fast-food chain Domino’s Pizza Biogen Abbott Laboratories Intel as well as social networking platforms Twitter and Snap. Schlumberger American Express and Kimberly-Clark reported Friday before the opening bell.

While Lockheed Martin is probably the only major company to report earnings on July 26 the market will be closely following the report of Alphabet on July 27. The Google parent will be joined by gadget giant Apple chipmaker AMD Starbucks and Microsoft in the after-hours. Before the opening bell aviation firm JetBlue and engineering behemoth General Electric are scheduled to report earnings.

The financial releases of Bristol-Myers Squibb aircraft builder Boeing and Ford Motor are the key events slated for July 28. The next day is going to be as hectic when the earnings announcements of e-commerce giant Amazon.com Altria Group Yum! Brands and Merck & Co. are on tap. Procter & Gamble oil giant ExxonMobil and Caterpillar are among the major companies preparing to report on July 30.

The company has had local presence in Malta since 2013 when it began operating under the trading name acquiring.com. The company is licensed and regulated by the MFSA and is Principal Member of both Visa and Mastercard.

Ryan Cachia Chief Financial Officer joined the firm in 2017 and currently sits on the Group Executive Team. He reflects: “Trust Payments was established in Malta in 2013 so we are no newcomers to the industry. As a financial institution we have continued to grow and diversify our portfolio year after year to tailor our product and service offering to client needs and market requirements. 2020 has been a record year for the company doubling our overall processing volumes and achieving a 65 per cent revenue growth year on year across the company with local growth in Malta being a key component of our success story.”

The company has indeed grown exponentially in Malta now with more than 120 employees and double the office space compared to last year. Ryan added “When looking at our overall success our biggest asset are our employees.” This ethos is one of the main reasons why Trust Payments was recently voted one of the UK’s best companies to work for in a poll.

David Falzon is the local Head of Sales who has been helping to spearhead the introduction of point of sale card terminals locally. As a payment specialist who has been working in banking and acquiring for the past 22 years he understands the importance of focusing on relationships. “When I first joined the company I found an exciting opportunity to introduce something new to the market” explained David. “I have always believed that there is an opportunity to offer a simpler way of doing business based on solid relationships and giving merchants exactly what they need to grow their businesses.”

From left: David Falzon local Head of Sales and Ryan Cachia Chief Financial Officer at Trust Payments.

And the strategy works. More and more local businesses are choosing Trust Payments terminals and like mushrooms after rain they are popping up everywhere all over Malta and Gozo. The ease of onboarding free technical support and settlement offered to any local or European bank account tick many boxes for local business owners. Malta’s strong close-knit business community means that Trust Payments had to make sure that they got it right from the beginning. David elaborated: “Business owners don’t need to wait weeks to know if their account will be accepted. The set-up process is highly efficient and enables merchants to start accepting card or digital payments and boosting their revenues within a matter of 48 hours in some cases. Our biggest pride is that most of our new merchants come via recommendations.”

For us it was business as usual from day one. Rather than being distracted by getting logistics in place for home working we were able to concentrate on what our merchants needed to survive the pandemic

The pandemic has of course changed the way consumers pay. As a technology company Trust Payments already had the capabilities for everyone to work remotely when the pandemic hit managing to switch all employees to full capacity home working rapidly. As Ryan explains “For us it was business as usual from day one. Rather than being distracted by getting logistics in place for home working we were able to concentrate on what our merchants needed to survive the pandemic.” Such needs included contactless portable terminals especially useful for shops and restaurants forced to suddenly make home deliveries.

Merchants also required the ability to send a payment link for their customer to make online payments as well as integrate a new payment option to their website quickly and easily. David added: “During the first few months the demand for these products soared and we worked around the clock to ensure that both our current merchants and new merchants got the help they needed. I think that our focus on merchant’s needs and our ability to deliver quickly helped in putting Trust Payments on the map as the acquirer of choice for local merchants.”

Trust Payments is only just getting started. The company plans to hire another 40 people by end of the year to support its growth and continue adding value added services to its product suite. As well as ‘pandemic-friendly’ payment services the company has also been working hard to prepare merchants for a flood of tourists. “Merchants are seeing an influx of foreign payments” explained David. “Tourists want to pay using different methods. Contactless and wearable devices are becoming very common. We partnered with American Express to offer cards acceptance of this prestigious card on our terminals. We just launched Dynamic Currency Conversion allowing customers to choose to pay in their home currency at the point of sale.”

The world of payments is transforming at incredible speed and there seems to be a new payment method or trend to keep up with almost every week. Looking more widely in Europe ‘buy now pay later’ where the customer can pay in installments is a big current trend as are payments via digital wallets where a physical plastic card is not needed. Is this the case in Malta?

Ryan’s opinion is clear: “During the pandemic we experienced a phenomenal increase in digital payments even from merchants that were traditionally only using cash. Digital payments are already the future and cash payments are on the decline. Countries like Denmark Sweden and Norway are leading the way when it comes to popularity of use of digital wallets or mobile payments and Italy is not far behind. Trust Payments is working very hard on new products which will enable merchants both in Malta and globally to ensure that they are prepared for this new reality.”

DeCicco

Correspondent/Taunton Daily Gazette

BERKLEY — Ashley Fullen responded to her neighbors' negative reaction to her family's plan to use their South Main Street farm as a recreational rental space with a full-on frontal assault.

Fullen and her husband Tom Fullen's proposal for their farm at 115R S. Main St. could include catered events educational workshops and open-air acoustic concerts.

Ashley Fullen brought the results of her research into what noise levels their plan will create to the selectmen's July 21 continued public hearing for EnVision Farm's special permit request.

She said she polled the neighbors and invited them to an ""open house"" on July 18 that included the type of outdoor music the couple is proposing.

She said she researched residential noise ordinances sound levels and how sound travels.

She reached out to the neighbors and concluded ""15 out of 32 neighbors (44%) fully support"" the couple's permit request and ""three out of the 32 neighbors (10%) are 'somewhat in support' and would 'appreciate' more limitations.""

More:Berkley farm wants to host movie nights and concerts. Neighbors are not happy.

Using a Map GEO map she showed that only one dwelling in the neighborhood measured under 400 feet (323 feet) away from the closest point of sound.

Another sheet in the packet she handed out to attendees at the July 21 hearing contained a graph on how sound reduces its decibel level the farther it travels. For every doubling of distance the sound level reduces by six decibels. The house 323 feet away from the source of their music location would be 70 decibels of a sound that started at 90 decibels.

The Fullens suggested their own permit limitations to include limiting attendance to events to 50 people and 40 cars and not to exceed three events per month and music events volume levels will be no more than 90 decibels and speakers no closer than 300 feet from any neighboring dwelling ""which would decrease the ambient noise to 70 decibels for our closest neighbor and under that for all other neighbors.""

But neighbors at the hearing focused their concerns on traffic not noise.

Residents expressed worries that turning back any vehicle beyond the 40 vehicles would cause traffic jams on South Main Street.

The Fullens responded that they will have traffic details present and will cap attendance by having ticketed events.

The selectmen continued the hearing again saying they will make a permit decision on Aug. 4 but not before commending the Fullens for working hard to address their neighbors' concerns.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm91dGRvb3JsaWZlLmNvbS9maXNoaW5nL25ldy1zd2ltYmFpdHMtZ2xpZGUtYmFpdHMtYW5kLWplcmstYmFpdHMtZnJvbS1pY2FzdC0yMDIxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New Swimbaits at ICAST 2021,"ICAST 2021 featured the latest and greatest fishing products and some of the most exciting new products were in the swimbait category. A swimbait even won Best of Show. Here’s a look at some of the most innovative swimbaits glide baits and jerk baits from ICAST.

Berkley PowerBait Gilly – ICAST 2021 Best Freshwater Soft Lure and Best of Show

The Gilly is an ultra-realistic bluegill swimbait that looks and swims like the real thing—designed in collaboration with Mike Iaconelli with fish-catching features like Berkley’s HD bait technology that gives the Gilly its stunning realism. It has a soft hollow head that allows for solid hookups and it makes the bait neutrally buoyant bait with a lower center of gravity. The lower center of gravity keeps the bait upright and creates a natural fall when you pause your retrieve. The bait’s articulated tail creates a lifelike swimming action. There are also stabilizing fins to further promote a realistic swimming action. You can rig the Gilly in many ways but the most common way is with an EWG hook through the side of the body. Iaconelli’s Instagram is a great resource for information on how to rig the Gilly. This swimbait will be available fall 2021 they’ll cost $7.49 per pack and come in three sizes.

A swimbait made from environmentally friendly hemp. Scott Einsmann Scott Einsmann

Jenko Groovy Glide Hemp

The Jenko Groovy Glide is a swimbait that you can glide wake or straight retrieve. It’s made from 100 percent US-sourced hemp which is environmentally friendly plant material that when processed can be thermoformed just like a typical plastic bait. According to Jenko it will last as long as a plastic bait for normal fishing applications. But if you lose the bait it will biodegrade within six months leaving only the metal components. The biodegrading process begins when the bait’s paint is scratched off which is why it won’t degrade in normal fishing. The bait is 5.5 inches and 1.4 ounces. You can purchase the plastic Groovy Glide right away but the hemp version won’t be available until the fall and will cost around $40.

The Jackall Bounty Fish 158 is a weedless walk-the-dog bait. Scott Einsmann

Jackall Bounty Fish

The Bounty Fish is for anglers that want to fish thick cover with big swimbaits. It’s a weedless bait that can be rigged with a 5/0 or 6/0 EWG hook. It has an irresistible walk the dog action that keeps the bait in the strike zone longer. When you look at the Bounty Fish you’ll notice the ribs that slow its acceleration and the tail articulation made from a unique netting that gives the Bounty Fish its signature kick. You can pick up a pack in late August for $9.99.

The World Minnow features flash boost technology.

Shimano World Minnow and World Diver

Shimano’s Flash Boost technology has been a secret weapon for tuna captains and saltwater anglers. That same fish-catching technology is in the new World Minnow aimed at the bass market. To fully appreciate Flash Boost’s ability to emit flash you need to watch the above video. For added visual appeal and realism the World Minnow has a holographic pattern with individual scales. The jerk bait also has Jet Boost which adds feet to the end of your cast. They retail for $19.99 and will be available early in fall 2021.

Nikko Winnow 95

Nikko didn’t forget to put the California Prop 65 warning on their packages. The Nikko Winnow 95 is made from medical-grade plastic that’s non-toxic and environmentally friendly. That means if a fish swims off with a piece of your bait in its stomach it won’t swell and cause issues. On top of the plastic being non-toxic it’s also extremely durable and the baits come in a wide range of awesome colors. The best part is you can buy the Winnow 95 right away for $14.99.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpbmVtYWJsZW5kLmNvbS90ZWxldmlzaW9uLzI1NzA5MDAvdGlmZmFuaS10aGllc3Nlbi10aHJvd2JhY2stc2F2ZWQtYnktdGhlLWJlbGwtcGljLWFsbC10aGUtaGF0c9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tiffani Thiessen Posts Throwback Saved By The Bell Pic And I Can't Stop Looking At All The Hats,"When looking back at teen sitcoms from the 1990s Saved By the Bell may be known as much for its fashion choices as its silly (if not problematic) hijinks. From headbands to Zack’s sweaters to Slater’s colorful tanks to Jessie’s vest obsession SBTB fashion could be a little all over the place. But it gave each character a singular identity. That’s why SBTB alum Tiffani Thiessen had fans reminiscing over the show’s fashion with a throwback photo from the sitcom.

The Saved by the Bell alum took to her Instagram to give SBTB devotees all the feels. Tiffani Thiessen pulled on more fans’ heartstrings by giving a Hot Sundae nod in her caption. But the real takeaway was the hats Thiessen along with co-stars Elizabeth Berkley and Lark Voorhies were sporting. Let’s just say they captured the 1980s and early 1990s fashion (which can be good or bad depending on your perspective). To see how each lady captured her personality check out the actress’s throwback post below:

A photo posted by on

Like many teenagers Tiffani Thiessen Elizabeth Berkley and Lark Voorhies managed to match their hats with their outfits. Floral prints and accents and varying textures are true to early 1990s fashion especially on Saved By the Bell. Like many teen-oriented shows in the 1990s Saved By the Bell was no stranger to reflecting the good the bad and the questionable in teen fashion. But this throwback photo made me think of some hat fashion sported on the classic sitcom.

Of course resident fashion queen Lisa Turtle was known for accessorizing her ensembles from head to toe. That meant hats (or scrunchies) had to be incorporated in some way. Even though she was Bayside High’s fashionista her choices ranged from fun and cute to obtuse. Each accessory matched Lisa’s outfit and mood to mixed results. This hat from Season 4 two-parter ""Wicked Stepbrother"" was one of her better looks. But no matter what Lark Voorhies was able to pull those looks off every single time.

In the Season 2 episode “Dancing to the Max” the rivalry between Zack Morris and A.C. Slater for Kelly Kapowski’s affections intensified in a dance battle. While Lisa and Screech eventually won it was someone else who really stole the show. In a “blink-and-you’ll-miss-it” moment Max (owner of The Max) wore the hat above to “cheer on” the contestants. The applause mechanism in that hat alone is a showstopper for distinct reasons.

Looking back now some of the SBTB fashions were even questionable for their time. But in a bizarre twist some of those styles are now back in fashion. So if all-denim ensembles and colorful tanks can make a comeback why not coordinated hats and quirky baseball caps? Unfortunately those fashions haven’t crept into the Save By the Bell reboot outside of Lisa Turtle’s cameo in Season 1.

While the hats were everything you can’t leave without acknowledging Tiffani Thiessen’s Hot Sundae reference. So here’s the “Got For It” music video.

For some Camborne is one of the most deprived towns in Cornwall. For others it's ""a place with real heart full of great people and businesses"".

During its glory days the town was one of the richest tin mining towns in the world.

More recently it has been struggling. There are high levels of unemployment and children living in poverty across the town.

In 2020 a map released by The House of Commons Library showed that the Cornish constituency with the most deprived neighbourhoods was Camborne and Redruth.

Camborne Treslothan Camborne Treswithian Camborne Trelowarren Pengegon were all part of the 10% most deprived places in the UK.

Despite the shape it may be in now Camborne was once home to many successful companies and venues even being recognised as the home of mining in the 19th and 20th century.

The town saw many booming businesses ranging from manufacturing companies to leisure businesses for the young people that lived in the town and its surrounding areas.

It would seem that people do miss the glory days of the town.

The Facebook page ‘Nostalgic Camborne’ created by Cheryl Houghton has gathered over 15000 members.

Cheryl’s motivations behind creating the page came from “a love for nostalgia and such very fond memories of growing up in Camborne.”

“I knew that people would have some great photos and stories to share"" she said. ""It’s always been a fantastic town and community.

“I still think it’s a place with real heart and character. It’s still got lots of great people businesses and places of interest.”

The recent government announcement about the Towns Fund Deal however gives Camborne an even more promising glimmer into what could be a fresh start for the more deprived areas.

The Towns Fund Deal is a government investment that intends to help provide struggling towns strengthen their local economy through bursaries.

Camborne is set to receive a £23.7m fund which is the largest amount that has been awarded in Cornwall.

Cheryl said she is hoping that the funding could see a return of the many attractions the town once had.

“If new funding streams help some viable opportunities for new attractions for Camborne that would be fantastic in my opinion"" she said.

The building has since been replaced by a bingo hall which has seen many transfers of ownership but the new plans propose that a theatre could be returning to the mining town included in the Buzz Station a new creative hub that can be found near where the current bus station stands.

The John Francis Basset was once home to a multitude of entertainment centres from a fish and chip shop to a cinema and arcade and latterly nightclubs.

The building’s majority shareholder was the Bartle family and it was their son Viv Bartle who introduced many of the entertainment venues into the John Francis Basset.

With rock and roll taking off in the late 50s and early 60s the snack bar put in a jukebox that gave local kids a place to hang out gaining popularity as the local meeting spot to chat and listen to music.

As the skating craze rolled in if you’ll pardon the pun the skating rink gained popularity welcoming skaters on Saturday nights to listen to the latest rock and beat hits.

Viv who was an avid music fan decided that it would be good to put on dances at the rink and its purpose built stage became an opportunity for local bands to play for the Thursday night dances.

With the dances becoming so popular Viv decided it would be best to make use of the Majestic Ballroom and while the capacity was smaller it allowed for the opportunity of both the ballroom and the rink to be available on a Saturday night.

The Bartle’s sold their shares in 1979 and the rink became The Berkley Centre with the ballroom being converted into office space.

It was in the early 2010s that the party life of the building had its last hoorah with the building remaining boarded up and closed until 2012 where the John Francis Basset now functions as a Wetherspoon pub and hotel. Clubbers from all over west Cornwall flocked to Camborne when it was The Corn Exchange.

Holmans

Camborne was one of the leading pioneers of mining in the world with the Holman Brothers being just one of the many notable names behind it all.

The Holman Brothers John Henry and James Miners Holman founded Holmans factories which manufactured mining machinery during Cornwall’s mining peak becoming a leading international company.

The company became Camborne’s major employer employing around 3500 people and when copper and tin deposits were found overseas in the 1870s Camborne fought back founding Camborne School of Mines.

While the school taught miners of the latest and most efficient mining techniques the Holman Brothers were developing the power of compressed air using it to drive rock drills.

After the First World War the company took it even further using their newly founded compressed air techniques to make equipment for mining and civil engineering projects all over the world.

There were three primary buildings in Camborne: the first was the works and office building located at the top of the town the second was ‘the boiler works’ located in North Roskear and the third which still stands today is found just next to the train station.

In 2003 after Holmans 1968 merge to become CompAir Holman the company announced they were moving operations to Germany.

Where the works and office building once stood is now a Tesco known locally as ‘little Tesco’ in reference to the Tesco Extra in Pool.

Locals still talk about Holmans as though it has only just left the town and it’s safe to say that the brothers left a lasting legacy in the small mining town.

The projects that could give Camborne a fresh start

The Buzz Station

This is the flagship project in Camborne's plans and involves the redevelopment of the Camborne Bus Station site to create a “vibrant and bustling hub at the heart of the town”.

The space is proposed as being architecturally iconic and will welcome locals to work live play and care in the bars restaurants and work spaces. The venue could also finally see the return of a theatre.

The total cost of the project is £21.9m - the original ask was for £17m to come from the Town Deal funding with another £4.8m in match funding.

Fibre Park

Employment and training are a key part of the proposals in the Camborne Town Deal proposals and this £3.8m project to be led by local software company Headforwards would help with that.

The Fibre Park would create almost 7000m2 of workspace on former Cornwall College and SWEB sites.

This would have “the world class digital connectivity required to meet the needs of one of the fastest growing tech clusters in the UK”.

Life Cycle Camborne

Cornwall Council is leading this health and wellbeing project which aims to create a network of cycleways and pathways around Camborne.

The £2m project is described as being part of aims towards a “carbon-neutral Camborne” around “car-free living and working”.

Project-A-Void

This scheme led by Camborne Business Improvement District (BID) aims to match local businesses with empty properties and would be the second phase of the scheme. With a total cost of £758000 it will look to bring 10 abandoned or dilapidated fronts in the town back into use.

In context to the heydays of Camborne this project has the potential to revive the high street.

Renovating the Recreation Ground

A £1.26m project this would see work to improve the Recreation Ground led by Camborne Rugby Football Club.

In a lawsuit filed earlier this month Crocs asserted that the footwear – first conceptualized during a sailing trip and originally presented as a boating shoe – has been “intentionally and frequently copied” by various companies.

The lawsuit was filed in various U.S. District Courts and seeks monetary damages.

""It is essential that we protect Crocs' iconic DNA and we will not tolerate the infringement of our rights or those who try to freeride on the investments we have made in our brand” Crocs Executive Vice President and Chief Legal and Risk Officer Daniel Hart said in a statement last week.

The footwear reportedly went ""back in style"" in recent months. Crocs reported record quarterly revenue of $640.8 million in the second quarter up 93% compared to the same period the year prior.

The July lawsuit filing builds upon a complaint filed with the United States International Trade Commission last month which asks for an investigation of shoes unlawfully imported into the country in violation of Crocs’ registered trademarks.

The ITC last week agreed to initiate an investigation into more than 20 companies that are selling products that inference with the company's trademarks.

""We pride ourselves in creating iconic products that are distinctly Crocs and this decisive action further demonstrates our commitment to protecting our brand our trademarks and other intellectual property"" Crocs CEO Andrew Rees said in a June statement. ""By blocking the importation and sale of trademark-infringing footwear we can ensure with confidence that our product DNA is fully protected while continuing to provide an authentically Crocs experience to our customers and consumers.""

There were some big adjustments as the parks started back up – some good some bad some still bad. As we move towards more ‘normal’ capacity crowds and into the two most popular seasons Halloween and the Holidays let’s take a look at what Disney got right what they didn’t and what we can live with… for now.

The Good

Cavalcades

When Magic Kingdom reopened it was without parades. What replaced them are the Character Cavalcades. Think of it as a one float/vehicle parade. While they started as “various times” throughout the day you can now find the times in the My Disney Experience App. The best part? Each park has its own version! While I can’t wait to see the parades return I hope they can keep some version of these cavalcades. Remember pre-closure Magic Kingdom was the only park to host a parade Festival of Fantasy!

Character Encounters

Character Encounters have replaced Character Meet and Greets. While there isn’t any hugging or autographs you can take photos with the characters at various locations throughout the parks. This is something my son Johnny has enjoyed much more than Meet and Greets. There is some great interaction to be had even from a distance. And the best part is not waiting in line. Each location has multiple areas where you can stand for pictures and the characters rotate through. While I patiently wait for the day I can give Mickey a big hug (I may actually cry when that happens) these Character Encounters are great engagement for those who don’t want to wait in line or for kids who are afraid to get too close.

Table Service Walk-up List Option

While table service dining options have increased and improved since reopening there are still hurdles to overcome (check out our thoughts below). A new option in the My Disney Experience app is the Walk-up List option. You can see which table service restaurants are open for walk-ups and add your name to the list. The only downfall is that you do need to be near the restaurant.

PhotoPass

PhotoPass has really taken a step in the right direction. In addition to the character Magic Shots there are also tiny world and super zoom Magic Shots. They also just recently brought back photo props!

The Bad

Mobile Ordering

Mobile Ordering has been around since 2017 and was a great convenience to pre-order without standing in line to wait. When the parks reopened it became required for most Quick Service dining options and still remains the preferred method of ordering. The result was that there were hour-long waits for time slots for ordering. While there have been improvements to the system the necessity to plan further in advance is definitely a disadvantage. With Mobile Order still being the primary way to order you would think that once you ask your order to be prepared it would be pretty timely. But we have found that is not always the case and it can still take upwards of 30 minutes to receive your food.

Resort Transportation

Quickly after the reopening Disney recognized the need for more resort transportation buses. With reduced capacity there simply weren’t enough to fulfill their needs. They brought on buses from a private company to alleviate the need. However there are still issues with available buses that continue.

The Slow Return of Entertainment Offerings

Hollywood Studios has been hit hard by the slow return of entertainment offerings. Indiana Jones Little Mermaid Beauty & the Beast Fantasmic do not currently have return dates. With few attractions (two of those being brand new) brings high guest demand to the park.

Streetmosphere really added to the uniquely immersive experience that is part of going to Walt Disney World. Which may be why Character Sightings/Encounters are popular now (think Anastasia/Druzella at Princess Fairytale Hall)? Sadly there were already so few park Streetmosphere acts just before closing last year. Are the Citizens of Hollywood now gone forever? The GF Society Orchestra was let go with no promise of returning. There also seem to be fewer Dapper Dan performances than ever… It seems Disney is using this timely opportunity to reset a lot of their parks’ offerings.

The In-between

Character Dining

Character dining has been available since the parks reopened. However the experience has been modified. Instead of interacting with the characters they parade around and stop briefly for photos. The close encounter is missing. While that’s understandable the value of the dining experience has gone down and hopefully soon we will see some increased interactions.

Dining Reservations

Gone are the 180-day dining reservations. When the parks reopened Walt Disney World moved to a more palatable 60-day dining window. This is great news for those that don’t want to plan where they want to eat 6 months in advance much less their vacations. Unfortunately over the last year dining reservations have been very difficult to get. With more restaurants opening and increased capacity in the restaurants this problem will hopefully work itself out.

FastPass

At the parks reopening it was announced that the FastPass system would not be returning. Last year there was no need for the FastPass system. Rumors and speculations are swirling after the announcement of the new paid Disney Premier Access at Disneyland Paris. I’m hoping for a system similar to the MaxPass that Disneyland offered. But as we are seeing the return to normal crowd levels it’s time to do something about the long lines.

Park Reservations

In addition to park tickets park reservations are also the new norm. Three reservation options are depending on the type of ticket you have. Theme Park Tickets for those guests not staying on property. Select Resort Hotels for most Disney resort packages or hotel stays and Annual Passes. On any given day your ticket may be blocked from one or all parks. While Theme Park Tickets and Select Resort Hotels can book up to 10 days (the max length of a multi-day ticket) Annual Passholders can only book 3 days at a time. While most days are currently available through the end of the year last-minute planners may be at a loss.

Park Hopping

Hopping became available again in January 2021. Currently park hopping isn’t available until 2:00 pm each day. It is great to have the option to park hop again. However you are required to scan into the park where you have your reservation before hopping. So if you really want to visit a park you can’t get a reservation for you can hop but stop by your assigned park first. The 2:00pm time is presumably due to the Rise Of Resistance Virtual Queue second access at 1:00pm each day. This allows those with reservations for Hollywood Studios to be the only ones able to get into the queue which is a good thing.

Delayed Construction and its effects on the 50th Anniversary Celebration

Understandably construction has been delayed. But to what cost? With the undetermined delay to Tron there is no new attraction coming to Magic Kingdom for the 50th Celebration.

Over at Epcot Ratatouille was set to open in May of 2019 now scheduled for October 1. There is no opening date announced for the Guardians of the Galaxy ride. Future World continues to be a maze of construction walls with little known on the fate of what’s to come. The Mary Poppins United Kingdom overlay ended up getting the ax. Space 220 is showing signs of opening sooner than later. The replacement of MouseGears Creations Shop is to open this summer along with the return of Club Cool. But looking at the construction they have a long way to go.

Let’s Hear From You

Overall there have been some great positive changes that came with the reopening of Walt Disney World. I hope many of the updates continue (or are evolved). But there are new difficulties with the park experience which must be fixed (transportation mobile order lack of entertainment in particular). What new procedures would you like to see stay in the parks? What do you want back that hasn’t returned yet?

However there’s one massive now-old school Disney IP that has plans for full theme park lands sitting in storage never having met the light of day.

This is a story of what might have been if Roger Rabbit lands had come to Disneyland and Walt Disney World.

Who Framed Roger Rabbit?

Our story begins in 1988 when Who Framed Roger Rabbit a loose adaption of the 1981 novel Who Censored Roger Rabbit? stormed into theaters. While today — for reasons we’ll get into in a bit — the movie may be a bit of a historical footnote at the time of its release it was a pop culture phenomenon.

The live action/animation hybrid film from director Robert Zemeckis was a co-production of Disney (under the Touchstone Pictures banner) and Steven Spielberg’s Amblin Entertainment and featured unprecedented cooperation between numerous animation studios including characters from Disney and Warner Brothers.

These never before seen interactions as well as popular original characters including Roger Rabbit Jessica Rabbit and Baby Herman made the film immensely popular amongst critics and viewers alike.

Who Framed Roger Rabbit? was a massive financial success becoming the second highest-grossing film of 1988 helping kickstart the Disney Animation Renaissance in the process. Almost immediately Disney’s Imagineers began brainstorming on how to include the hot new property in the company’s theme parks beginning with Walt Disney World’s then-new third gate.

Roger Rabbit at Disney MGM Studios

When the Disney MGM Studios theme park opened in 1989 Roger Rabbit was one of the new park’s focal point characters. A Roger character was heavily featured in promotional photos as well as meet and greets. In addition several references to Roger and his world were included in the park.

These included several billboards advertising new in-universe films starring the character the facade of Detective Eddie Valiant’s office – including a Roger-shaped hole through the window – in the park’s Echo Lake area and several props and photo-ops (including Judge Doom’s dip mobile) as part of the Studio Tour attraction. In addition a large-scale neon Jessica Rabbit was featured at Pleasure Island.

These references were initially meant to simply whet guests’ appetite for something much larger: an entire Roger Rabbit Land.

Roger Rabbit Land

As initially planned by Imagineers Roger Rabbit’s Hollywood would have been part of MGM’s early 90’s Sunset Boulevard expansion. Planned to be located roughly where the Rock ‘N’ Roller Coaster Starring Aerosmith stands today the land would have been themed to the film’s Maroon Cartoon Studios setting.

Roger Rabbit’s Hollywood was planned to include three attractions:

The Toontown Trolley: A “whacky” simulator ride through Toontown piloted by Roger Rabbit himself.

Baby Herman’s Runaway Baby Buggy: A dark ride attraction that would see guests ride in “giant baby carriages” themed to the Roger Rabbit short Tummy Trouble .

The Benny the Cab Ride: A dark ride themed to the film that would have seen guests ride in vehicles designed to look like the anthropomorphic character Benny. This attraction would eventually evolve into one built thousands of miles away.

In addition to the attractions Roger Rabbit’s Hollywood was scheduled to include numerous meet and greets and restaurants similar to the IP-based themed lands built today.

In addition to MGM Studios Roger Rabbit was also scheduled to play a major part in an a version of HollywoodLand that was scheduled to be built at Disneyland in the mid-1990s. The expansion was planned to be thematically similar to the MGM Studios area featuring at least the Benny the Cab dark ride.

Suffice to say these bicoastal plans would have made Roger Rabbit one of the most represented characters in Disney’s entire theme park library. So what happened? Well the answer to that is two-fold.

Who Cancelled Roger Rabbit Land?

First off both Roger Rabbit’s Hollywood in Florida and Disneyland’s HollywoodLand had been announced as part of the ambitious slate of projects that’s come to be known as the “Disney Decade.” However the initial financial failure of EuroDisneyland led to a majority of the “Disney Decade’s” projects being outright cancelled and the few that were eventually built were scaled down considerably.

Beyond the EuroDisney financial debacle Disney also ran into legal issues regarding Roger Rabbit. Specifically Disney and Amblin had numerous battles over usage of the characters in both animated shorts and merchandising. This animosity ended production on the shorts after only three were produced halted work on a potential sequel film and led to Disney dialing back Roger’s presence in the parks. However one major attraction starring the character did manage to get built.

In 1993 Disneyland saw the opening of Mickey’s Toontown. While the land’s name did harken back to the area seen in Who Framed Roger Rabbit? the area’s architecture was inspired by the design of Mickey’s Birthdayland at the Magic Kingdom and was centered around Mickey Minnie Goofy Donald and Chip & Dale.

However the area did feature Roger Rabbit’s Car Toon Spin a heavily-themed Roger Rabbit dark ride that evolved from the aforementioned Benny the Cab attraction scheduled for Roger Rabbit’s Hollywood and Hollywoodland. Toontown including Roger Rabbit’s Car Toon was duped to Tokyo Disneyland in 1996.

In the near 30 years since Roger Rabbit’s Car Toon Spin opened at Disneyland Roger Rabbit’s presence in the parks has only lessened. In fact outside of some niche merchandise (and even that’s dwindling) there are few remnants of the characters remaining outside of Car Toon Spin a statue at Walt Disney World’s Pop Century resort and the MGM – now Hollywood — Studios billboards which still stand… for now.

Chances don’t seem high for the long-awaited Roger Rabbit sequel either. In a 2018 interview Zemeckis said “The current corporate Disney culture has no interest in Roger and they certainly don’t like Jessica at all.”

Do you wish Roger Rabbit had a larger presence in the parks? Is it a loss that neither Roger Rabbit’s Hollywood or Hollywoodland were built? Let us know in the comments below.

The sequel to 1997’s Space Jam is packed with references from the studio’s vast library of franchises including Harry Potter DC comics and Game of Thrones.

Space Jam: A New Legacy may have bothered critics for leaning into the branding of it all but come on seeing the Looney Tunes play basketball on the Warner Bros ServerVerse was a ton of fun too. Let’s talk about the wildest movie references from WB movies that surprised us over the course of the movie:

LeBron Being Sorted As A Hufflepuff

The Harry Potter movies had a major presence in A New Legacy as the Wizarding World was seen with an entire planet devoted to it in the Warner Bros ServerVerse. Considering how big the franchise is to the studio this isn’t wild in and of itself but seeing a cartoon LeBron James being sorted into Hufflepuff certainly was. Come on the basketball legend is either a Gryffindor or Slytherin. You cannot convince me James is a Hufflepuff especially after Al-G pointed out how much he’s switched teams over the years to his movie son.

Of course if Warner Bros is going to show off their IPs DC Comics had to make their way into the movie but one way the filmmakers decided to do it is especially clever. Cartoon LeBron James is placed in a Robin costume in the sidecar to Bugs Bunny’s Batman in a funny nod to basketball fans often calling a team’s star the Batman and their co-star Robin. Space Jam is Bugs Bunny’s show and by the end it is clear the Looney Tune is the movie’s MVP. Sorry LeBron!

Lola Bunny Being Recruited By Themyscira

Another fun DC reference came in the form of the reintroduction of Lola Bunny who is seen hanging out in Themyscira with Wonder Woman and about to complete a challenge with her Amazons. It’s a far cry from the original Lola Bunny who gets Bugs all flustered when she stops at the court to join the Tune Squad. All the focus is more on Lola’s appearance in the ‘90s version where A New Legacy has the character being recognized more for her skills.

Foghorn Leghorn As Game Of Thrones’ Daenerys

As Space Jam: A New Legacy goes along the Looney Tunes fill a number of famous roles from Warner Bros franchises and the filmmakers definitely went for the unexpected. For example I would not have thought of Foghorn Leghorn first to dress up and say “Winter is Coming” as the Queen of Dragons Daenerys Targaryen but here we are.

Granny And Speedy Dodging Bullets Matrix Style

Space Jam: A New Legacy did an inspired job at bringing Granny into modern times with some seriously kick-ass moments. Between downing a martini at halftime and dressing in Matrix gear with Speedy to get us nostalgic about the 1999 science fiction film she was stealing the spotlight a lot in the movie. The Granny-Matrix crossover is just purely wild the more we think about it and definitely a hilarious highlight among A New Legacy’s WB references.

Rick And Morty Dropping Off The Tazmanian Devil

Alright so we expected some popular Warner Bros movies to pop up throughout Space Jam: A New Legacy but Rick & Morty? Now that was a shocker. The animated series is an Adult Swim show but that network is owned by Warner Media making it an off color cameo but very much another WB reference. The adventurers were seen dropping off Tazmanian Devil to Bugs Bunny as the Tune Squad forms.

The Droogs From A Clockwork Orange Standing Court-side

A New Legacy didn’t forget to mention some of the studio’s classics either with The Wizard of Oz and Casablanca among the movies being referenced. But in an especially odd choice in the film A Clockwork Orange’s Droogs can be seen in the audience of the big basketball game cheering on the Goon Squad during the movie. The characters in Stanley Kubrick’s movie are violent fellows who sexually assault a woman in front of her decapitated husband in the 1971 movie. The characters’ inclusion has in fact caused some backlash especially after Pepe Le Pew was cut from an appearance.

Elmer Fudd As Austin Powers’ Mini-Me

Another perhaps dated reference Warner Bros decided to include in Space Jam perhaps for its adult viewers is a segment where we venture into the world of Austin Powers. During the short sequence Elmer Fudd replaces Verne Troyer to appear as Mini-Me in a bit of a deepcut Warner Bros IP moment in the movie. It’s another funny gag we just didn’t see coming.

Al-G Quoting A Denzel Washington Line From Training Day

Yet another one for the parents and adults in the crowd came when Don Cheadle’s villain Al G. Rhythm dropped a famous line from 2001’s Training Day. In the final quarter of the basketball game when LeBron’s movie son switches over to the Tune Squad Al-G joins the game with a more advanced character for them to beat. He references the line “King Kong ain’t got shit on me” which Denzel Washington’s character says in the Warner Bros crime drama. It’s funny because King Kong is literally in the audience watching the game during the moment.

Wile E. Coyote As A War Boy In The Mad Max Scene

The Looney Tunes in Mad Max attire too? Yeah that happened! Bugs Bunny and LeBron James find Wile E. Coyote and his pal Road Runner in the setting of Fury Road with Coyote as a full on War Boy during the sequence.

All in all there’s so many easter eggs to beloved movies in Space Jam to count. Next time you watch the movie in theaters or HBO Max really pay attention to the audience during the big game because it’s flooded with more we didn’t get to.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vbmF0aW9uYWxpbnRlcmVzdC5vcmcvYmxvZy90ZWNobGFuZC9yZXBlYXQtYWZ0ZXItbWUtZGlyZWN0di1keWluZy1zbG93LWFuZC1wYWluZnVsLWRlYXRoLTE5MDQ1N9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Repeat After Me: DirecTV Is Dying a Slow And Painful Death,"It’s been known for many years that DirecTV has been bleeding subscribers even more than most pay-TV outlets.

It’s been known for many years that DirecTV has been bleeding subscribers even more than most pay-TV outlets. It got to the point where parent company AT&T has announced plans to spin off the satellite broadcaster.

According to an SEC filing by AT&T as cited by Yahoo Finance AT&T lost 2.3 million video subscribers year over year ending up with 15.412 million representing a 13 percent drop. AT&T’s video division consists of DirecTV as well as AT&T TV and AT&T U-verse

That said the loss in the second quarter was lower than the last several quarters-the lowest in fact since late in 2018. AT&T lost 473000 subscribers but it had lost 887000 in the second quarter of 2020 at the height of the pandemic.

The filing came ahead of AT&T’s planned release of quarterly earnings on July 22.

Multiple Spinoffs

AT&T’s long process of seeking to sell off a stake in DirecTV finally came to fruition in February when AT&T agreed to spin off DirecTV into a separate company with private equity giant TPG owning a stake. AT&T will control 70 percent of the new company with TPG owning the other 30 percent.

The deal is expected to close later this year.

“This agreement aligns with our investment and operational focus on connectivity and content and the strategic businesses that are key to growing our customer relationships across 5G wireless fiber and HBO Max. And it supports our deliberate capital allocation commitment to invest in growth areas sustain the dividend at current levels focus on debt reduction and restructure or monetize non-core assets” AT&T CEO John Stankey said when the TPG agreement was announced.

A couple of months later in a deal that came together much more quickly AT&T announced another spinoff announcing that WarnerMedia would be combined with Discovery Networks and spun off into a separate company. According to The Verge the new company will be called Warner Bros. Discovery.

Discovery President & CEO David Zaslav will lead the combined company AT&T and Discovery said in the release back in May although executives from both companies will remain involved.

“With a library of cherished IP dynamite management teams and global expertise in every market in the world we believe everyone wins...consumers with more diverse choices talent and storytellers with more resources and compelling pathways to larger audiences and shareholders with a globally scaled growth company committed to a strong balance sheet that is better positioned to compete with the world’s largest streamers” Zaslav said in a statement at the time of the merger.

With all strong performances during day one qualifiers how did day two of dressage qualifiers at the Tokyo Equestrian Park pan out?

Team GB Day Two Dressage

In the day two dressage qualifiers at Tokyo only Charlotte Dujardin was left to ride for Team GB. Taking Olympic debut ride Gio into the Olympic arena all eyes were on the two-time Olympic champion and her new partner.

Charlotte Dujardin and Gio

A very different Olympic Games was ahead of Charlotte this year. Usually accompanied her experienced multi-medalled partner Valegro this year the rider took to the stage with Gio.

A horse who caught Charlotte’s eye in 2016 the pair have gone from strength to strength. Seemling thriving under pressure in their first international Grand Prix together they not only posted their best score but won the class. However before heading to the Olympic the gelding only had three international Grand Prix stars under his belt.

Under the Olympic lights the pair proved themselves once again. Leaving the arena with a score of 80.963% the pair not only achieved a personal best together but Gio’s first score over 80% at international Grand Prix level.

After the qualifier Charlotte commented;

I couldn’t ask any more from him tonight he went in and he tried his absolute heart out” gushed Charlotte. “He’s just unbelievable. He gives me everything he’s got even though he needs to get stronger and a bit more confident. I can’t ask anymore of him.” “I felt so emotional on the last centre line because when you have a ride like that it doesn’t matter if you win or lose. He’s absolutely lived up to expectations.” “To me this was as good as winning tonight because I know he couldn’t have done any more for where he is right now in his training and with how few competitions he’s done. That’s like a gold medal one of those really special moments that I’ll remember for forever and a day.”

Charlotte and Gio finished second in their group meaning that they qualify for the individual finals. They finished just behind one of their top competitors Team Germany’s Isabel Werth.

Meanwhile early anticipating the day’s results Carl Hester was awaiting confirmation for his qualification for the individual final. Placing 4th in his group Carl needed his score with En Vogue to remain in the top eight. By the end of the day the duo placed 16th in the qualifying rankings.

Other Day Two Dressage Highlights

The world No.1 ranked rider Isabell Werth of Germany took the top score for the day two dressage qualifers. Isabell posted a score of 82.500% on board 17-year-old Westphalian mare Bella Rose. With beautiful self-carriage in the passage and scoring 9s and 10s from the seven international judges the duo will advance to the Individual Finals on Wednesday (July 28). However fellow German Jessica von Bredow-Werndl has the highest score heading into the final after her brilliant display during day one qualifiers with TSF Dalera.

But what happens after the flush? At Buffalo Point Campground human waste is treated at one of two wastewater treatment plants. Incoming wastewater first passes through a bar screen to remove objects like rags and sticks. It's eventually pumped into an aeration tank where microbes--tiny living organisms--break down ammonia into nitrates (NO) and nitrites (NO). The microbes use up the oxygen in these compounds and the leftover nitrogen gas is stored in their cell walls. When the microbes are reintroduced to oxygen they release the stored nitrogen gas which makes its way into the atmosphere. Once these nutrients are removed the water is disinfected with chlorine and then dechlorinated. The treated water using Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ) standards is then released back into the environment in accordance with permits issued by the State.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZlZGVyYWx3YXltaXJyb3IuY29tL25ld3Mvd2FzdGUtbWFuYWdlbWVudC1pbnRlcm5zLWhlbHAtZmVkZXJhbC13YXktd2l0aC13YXN0ZS1yZWR1Y3Rpb24tcmVjeWNsaW5nL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Waste Management interns help Federal Way with waste reduction recycling,"The WM Recycle Corps internship program for college students is the only one of its kind in the recycling industry across North America.

You might see them putting new decals on recycling dumpsters handing out reusable utensils at a local festival or helping unload items at community recycling events.

The Waste Management (WM) team of highly trained interns i back on the beat moving the needle on waste reduction and recycling in Federal Way.

The WM Recycle Corps interns have recently completed an extensive recycling boot camp and are now ready to assist the community. Much of their summer will focus on helping property managers and residents improve recycling programs at apartment and condominium communities.

WM interns will also be tagging recycling carts for residential customers who need reminders about what’s acceptable in Federal way’s curbside recycling program. Research shows that messaging residents just before they pt items in carts can greatly improve sorting accuracy according to WM.

Initiated by WM in 2010 the WM Recycle Corps is an award-winning program in the Puget Sound. The annual cohort internship for college students is the only one of its kind in the recycling industry across North America.

That's the goal promoters of the Mogagreen programme hope to achieve over the next 10 years.

At a meeting at the offices of the association Be Green Mogagreen described its plans to lay the foundations for better recyclable waste management in Morocco and perhaps even throughout the continent.

Mogagreen is just the start; it's a pilot scheme with scale-up potential.

""We believe that the waste management industry hasn't even got into gear yet. We want to use technology and digitalisation to create an alternative model with a potentially major impact on the circular economy and urban sustainability"" Youssef Chaqor told Middle East Eye.

Chaqor is founder of Inveko-Environnement one of the original companies behind the project and one already specialised in the valorisation of - or getting better value out of - used cooking oils.

Officially launched at the end of May and due to go live at the end of July the project now has the support of various other private entities and provincial and community stakeholders.

At present the traditional model prevails: collection then burial in designated but overflowing landfill sites.

By bringing the entire sector into Mogagreen's reach and digitising the process the project leaders hope to reduce the quantity of recyclable matter going to landfill including the portion of recyclables that are irrecoverable due to soiling by organic waste in bins.

Awareness campaign to win support

The Moroccan association Zero Zbel experts in the field estimate the volume of this rubbish to be 18000 tonnes per day.

'We want to create a real community and inspire it to build a sustainable project for the future' - Youssef Chaqor co-founder of Mogagreen

The first link in the chain: 20000 households 300 companies and 20 schools in Essaouira will be able to download an app or use WhatsApp to indicate their location to waste collectors or alternatively deliver their waste to designated drop-off points.

Mogagreen is counting on this multi-channel approach and on a major awareness-building campaign to win support.

""The awareness-building and educational campaigns account for 1.7 million dirhams [$190000] out of a global budget of 5.5 million"" said Marouane Malek project manager at Inveko-Environnement.

Another driver is rewards. Users will be able to earn points based on the quantity of waste sorted which they can convert into rewards such as phone top-ups.

The goal is to create a real community and to ""make that community want to collaborate with us and build a sustainable project that will last well into the future"" said Chaqor.

The second link in the chain is the rubbish collectors. The collecting and primary sorting process still falls to individuals in the informal sector: trash pickers known as bouaara in the local Moroccan dialect.

The minister for the environment estimates their number at some 100000 nationwide. According to Zbel the actual figure is around three times greater.

Morocco is going green and the rest of the world should take note Read More »

On top of the 50 or so green jobs created Mogagreen hopes to get local bouaara ""on side"" by granting them self-employed status together with the associated benefits (health insurance access to the banking and telephone systems and so forth).

This aspect is particularly close to Tarek Ouamira's heart. Arriving in Morocco six years ago this former senior transport and logistics technician chose the Atlantic coast ""Windy City"" of Essaouira to build up his own business of collecting and pre-sorting rubbish from restaurants and hotels. His very human self-financed efforts served as something of a dry run for Mogagreen.

Ouamira currently collaborates with three collectors on a formal basis on their own account. ""These people are really committed. There's a profound desire on the part of the collectors to gain self-employed status"" he told MEE.

""On the technical side it's a bit more complex. Training is needed for example to learn the different categories of plastic. Essentially for them this work is about survival.""

This future community of ""happy collectors"" wearing the Mogagreen colours will also have their own mobile app to allow them to organise and facilitate collections.

The third and final link is constituted by the companies or business groupings that at the other end of the chain are responsible for putting a financial or energy value on the waste.

""Our aim is to construct an extensive ecosystem. Parties may participate either as co-investors in the [secondary sorting] platform or recovering materials"" said Chaqor.

At the outset only plastic cardboard glass and frying fats will be valorised. Ultimately textiles and old bread may be brought in to the process along with other fermentable waste that can be made into biomass.

Drawing on collective intelligence

Besides the technological aspect for the founders of Mogagreen the method has its own inherent form of innovation: collective intelligence.

Preliminary discussions are already underway as part of the Essaouira Territory Innovation Lab initiative led by the association O'TED.

The Essaouiri ""lab"" has been operative since the end of 2018 and has inspired further labs to open in Sidi Ifni and Rahman with Fes due to follow shortly.

In his small business Tarek Ouamira collects and pre-processes waste to send it to the various existing recovery channels (MEE / Tarik Ouamira)

Ouamira runs a small business in Essaouira collecting and pre-treating waste before sending it on through the various existing valorisation channels.

""The aim of these regional innovation laboratories is to harness collective intelligence in the service of the common good"" said Zineb Belaabid volunteer and founding member of O'TED.

""We help operators at district level (associations public authorities businesses individuals etc) to identify shared problematics and co-construct solutions. We serve as a catalyst.""

In Essaouira waste management among other environmental matters has rapidly garnered interest attracting more than 70 volunteers among them Ouamira and Chaqor.

Morocco goes to war on the plastic bag but imports waste from Italy Read More »

A crucial connection is helping to drive Mogagreen's emergence. ""The point of collective intelligence is that everyone sees what is happening and works together towards a better life"" said Ouamira.

Also an integral part of the process the local province has managed to locate synergies within its own regional project.

Essaouira Province Governor Adil El Maliki is keen to draw attention to a project for the installation of recycling bins that form part of rehabilitation plans for Essaouira's ancient medina and the creation of an ecovillage at Sidi Kaouki.

""Mogagreen has every chance and opportunity to succeed and for its success to be shared and replicated in other regions throughout the kingdom"" he said at the official launch.

Even with so much goodwill and potential behind it the challenge Mogagreen faces is no small one.

First of all the financing needs to be finalised which will depend principally on the participation of the major food industry brands as well as on a national strategy already falling short on expectations.

Morocco produces an annual 6.9 million tonnes of waste. Although the National Plan for Household Waste Management (PND) is scheduled to recycle 20% of it by 2022 last year it only achieved a figure of 7 percent. Plastics recycling amounted to 11 percent with the remainder often ending up in the countryside.

The trick will be to keep all stakeholders on board and committed to building an effective and sustainable model.

By John Heinis/Hudson County View

“Residents have explained to us that they are being way overcharged on what was supposed to be a nominal fee for their waste collection after these services were acquired by the MUA” Fulop said in a statement.

“In response I’m asking people not to pay their bills specific to the solid waste collection fees until the MUA rectifies the issue and for those who have already paid we will make sure you get a credit for future payments.”

This afternoon Suez put out an alert advising their customers not to pay the solid waste fee on their monthly bill for service. The MUA could not be reached for comment on Saturday.

Historically the city provided waste disposal services through an outside vendor until January of this year when the MUA officially accepted the assignment of the solid waste contract.

Their board approved the measure back in September at the same meeting where they approved a $133 million budget with a nine percent hike on water and sewer rates.

During the pilot episode of Hudson Media Group’s “Meeting with the Mayor” this Wednesday a question and answer session that this reporter participated in Fulop defended the solid waste collection fee as a way for tax-abated properties to pay their fair share.

” … We go into the year every year with trying to figure out tens of millions of dollars in added costs from the previous year not because we’ve spent additional money just because of the structure and cost of running anything has increased – it’s a big challenge” he said during the hour-long program.

” … What you know about tax abatements is they don’t participate in that added cost of government at all because they have a fixed payment that they make regardless what happens to the taxes of regular residents like you and I. So something like garbage collection – which goes u exponentially every single contract and is a big challenge for the city – those tax abatement building don’t participate in it which isn’t fair.”

Fulop also argued the fee isn’t a back door tax since while the average homeowner’s tax bill went up $300 due to the MUA it also went down nearly a $1000 on the city’s end due to a 20 percent municipal tax decrease made possible due to American Rescue Plan funds.

Nevertheless Councilman-at-Large Rolando Lavarro today continued to refer to it as such and also asserted that it was never about tax fairness.

“The original intention of this backdoor tax had always been to hide a potential tax increase before the American Rescue Plan literally came in and rescued our city budget” he said in his own statement.

“Mayor Fulop and his Council allies only acknowledged the backdoor tax when media attention finally brought it to light and when the public was practically standing outside City Hall with virtual pitchforks and torches.“

And as recently as the July 9th Department of Public Works Budget Hearing Lavarro called for records and answers as to the assignment of the trash collection contract from the City of Jersey City to the Jersey City MUA.

Additionally Ward E Councilman James Solomon an outspoken critic of this measure thanked the administration for finally taking action as well as the residents who helped make this happen by voicing their concerns.

“I’m going to file this under ‘better late than never.’ We’ve been sounding the alarm on this backdoor regressive $300 flat tax on low income families since February. I’m not sure why it took the administration this long to figure it out. I’m just glad they did” he stated.

“I appreciate the work done by Jersey City residents who have made their voices heard on this issue. We’re going to remain vigilant to make sure real action is taken to eliminate this unfair tax.”

The solid waste fee had drawn scrutiny in recent weeks with an online petition to repeal the measure collecting 871 signatures.

Later this afternoon declared mayoral challenger Lewis Spears said this is a prime example of why residents should be allowed to weigh in on city policies like this one before it is implemented.

“Jersey City residents were negatively impacted by the consequences of a policy that seemed to be rushed into place. They demanded to be heard and now we essentially have a reversal of course” he noted.

“I believe that giving residents a chance to weigh in on policy—especially policy that directly impacts their pockets—before it is implemented could go a long way towards identifying and mitigating both the risks and the consequences.”

Hammett vice president of the offshore-drilling company Sedco Inc. in an edition of New Scientist published on December 9 1982.

Hammett was referring to delays in plans to mine metal-rich rocks from the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. At the time Sedco and other companies were hoping to launch a deep-sea mining industry but by that point they had been held back by more than a decade of negotiations at the United Nations over the question of who owns the seabed.

Nearly 40 years later deep-sea mining still hasn’t begun. But an announcement late last month by Lionel Aingimea president of the small Pacific-island state of Nauru carried a similar sentiment to Hammett’s charmless threat and it could bully the industry into existence—fast.

The government of Nauru working with its seabed-mining contractor Nauru Ocean Resources Inc. a subsidiary of the Metals Company (T.M.C.) has triggered a contentious provision in international law that could force seabed mining to begin in distant waters of the Pacific within two years.

This decision would go against the advice and warnings of scientists NGOs and sustainability-minded politicians. It forestalls years of multi-national negotiations over how to manage and protect the seabed.

It also coincides with a series of damning reports released in recent weeks about T.M.C. a public company founded earlier this year through the merger of DeepGreen and Sustainable Opportunities Acquisition Corporation and its C.E.O. Gerard Barron that raises troubling questions about his professed commitment to protecting the planet—and his dominance over the nascent deep-sea-mining industry.

Changing Tides

The deep ocean is the single biggest interconnected habitat on earth. Averaging two and a half miles deep and reaching nearly seven miles at its greatest depth it contains a vast storehouse of biodiversity from corals that live for millennia to intricate jelly creatures much of which remains unexplored. It supports vital planetary functions such as the cascade of carbon whereby tens of billions of tons are removed each year from the atmosphere and sunk into deep seabed stores.

The Metals Company insists that deep-sea metals are essential for a transition to a global green economy specifically electric vehicles. Volvo and BMW disagree.

For now the deep is relatively unspoiled. But it’s also uniquely sensitive to human impacts. Seabed mining would impose a colossal new footprint one from which the ocean is unlikely to recover within human timescales. It would erase biodiversity and create noise and light pollution and sedimentation threatening life well beyond the boundaries of the mines themselves (fisheries fed by deep-derived nutrients for instance not to mention a livable climate).

Gerard Barron’s branding team have been crafting a story of green redemption that holds immense influence over the global narrative of seabed mining. T.M.C. refers to it as “harvesting” even though the rocky nodules they wish to exploit have not been sown by human hands and are not renewable—it takes 10 million years for a nodule to grow from the size of a pea to that of a golf ball.

T.M.C.’s is ostensibly a worthy cause: the metals they plan to produce from polymetallic rocks would be used to power electric vehicles. But that doesn’t mean that the process itself is green in any way.

Barron told me he considers himself an environmentalist. He is likely one of the only self-professed environmentalists who have made a good deal of money from the deep-sea-mining industry. He invested in Nautilus Minerals when it was planning to open the world’s first deep-sea mine targeting hydrothermal vents off Papua New Guinea. Barron reportedly turned a $226000 investment into $31 million cashing out a good while before the company went bankrupt in 2019.



Barron has referred to the seafloor he wishes to mine as a marine desert contrary to mounting scientific studies which suggest it is more similar to species-rich aquatic prairies. He insists that deep-sea metals such as nickel and cobalt are essential for a transition to a global green economy in particular for the building of a billion electric-vehicle batteries—this despite recent actions by Samsung SDI Volvo and BMW to support a mining moratorium and exclude seabed metals from their supply chain.

A recent report in The Wall Street Journal revealed that Barron’s grand efforts to paint his company green have paid off. New investors eager to back environmental initiatives are throwing their money behind T.M.C. Currently valued at $2.9 billion the company is reportedly set to receive another $600 million in investor cash in the coming months.

The Metals Company C.E.O. Gerard Barron discusses plans for Nauru marking the world’s first foray into deep-sea mining.

This is part of a larger trend. With BlackRock’s Larry Fink favoring environmental social and corporate-governance (E.S.G.) funds the pressure is on for wealthy investors to manage their money with an eye toward protecting the planet. For a lot of people as long as it sounds good it works for them.

Wishful Thinking

Back in December of 1982 the day after Hammett’s statement in New Scientist the U.N.’s Law of the Sea Convention designated the seabed in the high seas more than 200 nautical miles from any nation’s shores as the “common heritage of mankind.” Any benefits gleaned from this enormous area must be shared among all of humanity.

Decades later this idea of common heritage feels Utopian. T.M.C. has signaled its good intentions—or just flashed its shrewd marketing muscle—by working closely with small impoverished states such as the South Pacific’s Tonga Kiribati and Nauru. These countries gain a cut of mining revenues in return for applying to the International Seabed Authority for permits.

Barron says he considers himself an environmentalist.

In order to mine the seabed private companies must be sponsored by a state. It transpires that while the Nauru government is prepared to help T.M.C. by triggering the mining loophole and securing the permits they have also put themselves at risk by signing deals with the company.

Documents revealed last month show that should any accidents or disasters occur during mining operations Nauru and the other South Pacific island states could be liable for the cleanup.

The deals also leave those nations virtually powerless over T.M.C. and how they operate. And as demonstrated during recent field trials by another company—when a scaled-down prototype mining robot became disconnected from its mother ship—accidents will almost certainly happen with heavy machinery operating several miles beneath the surface of the ocean.

The first wave of deep-sea mining was abandoned in the 1980s because corporations decided it wasn’t worth the effort and expense. Today in addition to those burdens we know much more about its negative effects on the environment making this second wave all the more alarming.

T.M.C. is just one of 22 corporations that want to mine the deep sea but it’s the only one planning to go public soon. It’s raking in funds and is deeply involved in Nauru’s demands for the world’s first high-seas mining permit.

Green investors must demand answers about where their money is going. And member states to the International Seabed Authority especially the quiet ones need to step up to their official remit of protecting the deep ocean from harm and vote to withhold mining permits for at least the 10-year moratorium proposed by hundreds of expert scientists—the ones who really know what’s going on down there.

In this post I'll explain why your FICO score is so important how it's calculated and how you can learn what it is by taking advantage of the rapidly expanding list of credit cards that will tell you your score for free.

Your FICO score is instrumental in how financial institutions view your creditworthiness.

What are the different kinds of credit scores?

While there was originally only one FICO score companies have developed different ways to measure your creditworthiness as time has passed. These include the FICO score 8 or 9 as well as the VantageScore 3.0 and 4.0.

There are several differences between the two methods. The FICO scores 8 and 9 offer slightly different scores for each of the three major credit bureaus while VantageScore offers a single number for all three bureaus. Other differences include importance given to bills sent to collection credit utilization and hard inquiries.

Importance of the FICO credit score

Your FICO score (a product of the Fair Isaac Corporation) is the foundation of most financial transactions you make. If you want a loan at competitive interest rates be approved for a credit card or pass a background check you need to have an acceptable FICO score. Knowing your score can help you anticipate what to expect from these kinds of transactions.

Your FICO score isn't static. It evolves with your finances and you can improve (or damage) it depending on your degree of fiscal responsibility. That's important because it means you can cultivate a high score over time with good financial habits even if you have bad credit (or no credit). Your FICO score allows you to track the state of your finances and can alert you to any problems such as a missed payment or identity theft.

Knowing your FICO score is helpful when it comes to travel rewards because it can give you a sense of which credit cards you're likely to be approved for allowing you to maximize your applications.

How your FICO score is determined

TPG has written previously about how your FICO score is compiled; here's a brief refresher:

35% payment history

30% amounts owed

15% length of credit history

10% new credit

10% types of credit

The factors that affect your score the most are late or missed payments and your credit utilization — also known as the ratio of how much credit you're using to how much credit is available to you.

Length of credit history also affects your score so it makes sense to keep your oldest accounts open unless you have a compelling reason to close them. Negative ""remarks"" (like a late payment or accounts in collections) stay on your credit report for seven years. That's a long time to pay for a mistake and have it be an obstacle to earning points and miles. Fortunately negative remarks affect your score less and less as they age.

Credit cards that show your score

The good news is that accessing your FICO score for free is now easier than ever thanks in large part to the FICO Score Open Access Program launched by the Fair Isaac Corporation. This program allows credit card issuers that have already purchased the FICO information to share it with customers at no additional charge.

The following credit card issuers now offer your FICO score for free either online or with your monthly statement.

American Express provides its cardholders with not only an educational FICO score but also their Fico Score 8. The latter number is the credit score the issuer uses to manage cardmembers' accounts and is based on data from a major credit-rating agency Experian.

The corridor is in the midst of a $32 billion public and private investment spree according to Weitzman Associates an investment and development advisory firm — likely the most of any 17-block stretch in town.



More than $13 billion in public infrastructure work has been completed or soon will be of which the lion’s share is $11.2 billion for the MTA’s East Side Access — the underground eight-track terminal that will bring the Long Island Rail Road into Grand Central Terminal for the first time.



Nearly $19 billion is committed to ongoing or planned commercial development including the rising JP Morgan Chase tower at 270 Park Ave. ($4.04 billion) recently completed One Vanderbilt at 42nd Street ($3.32 billion) and the biggest of all — the proposed Project Commodore at 175 Park Ave. a 2.5 million-square-foot office and hotel skyscraper on a site that includes the now-closed Grand Hyatt Hotel.



“There have been more fashionable destinations over the years such as Flatiron. But at the end of the day Park Avenue is the central spine of East Midtown” said Weitzman principal and managing director Peter Bazeli. The firm has worked with several avenue office landlords over the years and is currently advising owner Dajia Insurance Group on its Waldorf-Astoria redevelopment project to be completed in 2023.



The landmarked Waldorf “occupying a whole city block will be “the focal point of Park Avenue glamor” when it reopens Bazeli added.



Park Avenue office tenants enjoy easy access to Grand Central’s Metro-North lines to the affluent northern suburbs and multiple subway lines and soon to the LIRR as well.

“With continued economic growth will come more demand for transit-oriented workspace Bazeli said. He noted that One Vanderbilt for example was “predicated on easy transit access” which developer SL Green enhanced with $220 million in new public entrances corridors and lobbies.



“If any segment of the Manhattan market is going to be resilient this is the location” Bazeli said.

Park Avenue seemed to be losing some luster to Sixth Avenue and downtown a few years ago especially when Wells Fargo left 250000 square feet at RFR’s 375 Park Ave. (the Seagram Building) for Hudson Yards. But Raymond James’ lease for 160000 square feet at Mutual of America’s 320 Park Ave. last summer lifted spirits.



The avenue’s renaissance is spurred in part by East Midtown’s rezoning which allows much larger buildings than previously permitted in exchange for developers’ commitment to pay for public streetscape and transit upgrades.



A stroll on the avenue today — still relatively quiet as office towers await the return of most employees — reveals only part of what’s happening. Obvious changes include the JPMorgan Chase tower’s rising steel and just-completed Foster + Partners-designed 425 Park Ave. Developed by L&L Holding Co. it will be home to Ken Griffin’s powerhouse financial firm Citadel.



Major auction house Phillips boasts a new much more visible home in the white-glass cube of 432 Park Avenue. Phillips CEO Edward Doman said “Thanks to studioMDA’s brilliant design our building marries the interior exterior and the piazza creating a sense of community in a bustling metropolis and engaging the millions of international passersby from the street level.”



Less obvious but equally important are significant upgrades in progress behind temporary plywood at avenue-straddling 230 Park Ave. (the one-time Helmsley Building) Fisher Brothers’ 299 Park and the Stahl Organization’s 277 Park.

Meanwhile Rudin Management and Vornado are weighing a possible combined redevelopment of Vornado’s 350 Park Ave. and Rudin’s 40 E. 52nd St. behind it.

RXR Realty owns 4 million square feet at 230 Park Ave. and 237 Park Ave. and at three nearby addresses — 450 Lexington Ave. 340 Madison Ave. and 530 Fifth Ave. It’s also slated to be the lead developer of 175 Park Ave.



RXR chairman and CEO Scott Rechler said the 175 Park project is awaiting city approval under the Uniform Land Use Review Procedure which he said could be completed by year’s end. The mega-tower would have 2 million square feet of offices. Could there really be a market for it given today’s highly uncertain conditions?



“We’re having conversations today with anchor tenants” Rechler said. “When you think about large companies growing in the city when you want to be right on top of public transit where do you find it on a scale like this?”



He said that the post-COVID market will see “a flight to quality” among space-seekers.

3 Auction house Phillips’ new location at 432 Park Ave. was designed to offer a “sense of community in a bustling metropolis.” Brett Beyer.

“People returning to the workplace need a reason to return to the workplace — an energized neighborhood clustered around nodes of activity and transit” Rechler said. “Look at One Vanderbilt. It continued to lease up throughout the pandemic and is now 90 percent occupied. Each thing helps the overall market.”



Now all Park Avenue needs is for employees to return to their desks.

School supplies were given out to the students from the various vendors and the Michael D. Johnson Foundation.

Local residents praised Johnson who played in the NFL from 2009 to 2018.

“I love the fact Michael Johnson came back to give to the community” said Renee Harris of Rural Health Services.

McGuire said he was honored to participate in the Michael D. Johnson event.

“It’s truly a blessing to part of an event that someone consistently producing for the community” McGuire said. “We always want to be part of that.”

The Flyers got even more salary relief and shook up their offense swapping veteran fan favorite Jakub Voracek for Blue Jackets right winger Cam Atkinson.

Atkisnson averaged .64 points per game over 10 seasons in Columbus eclipsing 20 goals six times including 41 goals scored in 2018-19. He carries with him four more seasons under contract at a hair under $6 million per in cap hit.

Voracek's full $7.5 million now comes off the books as the Flyers shed he and his recent struggles. Though he was an asset machine he scored just 21 combined goals over the last two truncated seasons. He also was more or less invisible during the postseason.

We'll see if there are even more moves to come as this eventful offseason continues.

The big-hitting Basque became a father in 2021 before losing out on a near-certain title triumph due to a positive Covid test and then claiming his first major at the US Open. He was all set to head to the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 golf tournament as world number one after his top-three finish at the Open Championship. But his year took another turn on Sunday (25 July) when the Spanish Olympic Committee announced that he would miss the event after testing positive again for Covid. European Tour player Adri Arnaus was selected alongside Rahm for the men's competition at the Kasumigaseki Country Club with Rio 2016 Olympians Sergio Garcia and Rafa Cabrera Bello opting to skip Tokyo. Garcia is focusing on making Europe's Ryder Cup team with Cabrera citing personal reasons. Santiago Tarrio is the first alternate for Spain but time is against the national finding a replacement with the first round starting on Thursday (29 July).

'Rahmbo' denied tilt at more history It's been a year to remember for Jon Rahm in more ways than one. After a string of solid performances he became a father in April with wife Kelley giving birth to son Kepa. Days later he was teeing it up in the Masters and finished tied for fifth at Augusta. A fortnight after his first missed cut of the year in the Wells Fargo Championship the 26-year-old took a share of eighth in the PGA Championship won by his friend and fellow former Arizona State University star Phil Mickelson. That inspired 'Rahmbo' who made a superb start to the defence of his Memorial Tournament crown. A hole-in-one helped him into a two-stroke lead after two rounds and a third-round 64 left him six clear of the field. But after rolling in his putt at the 18th he was informed that he had tested positive for Covid and was forced to withdraw from the event. Two negative tests on consecutive days cleared him to take part in the US Open and he grabbed the opportunity with both hands. As he moved into contention in the final round at Torrey Pines Mickelson did his bit to make life easier for Kelley and Kepa. The golfers met when Rahm was at college and 'Lefty' was so impressed he told his friends - and made bets - that the Spaniard would one day reach the world's top 10.

Rahm once had a reputation for hotheadedness but showed admirable calm as he holed long putts for two closing birdies to become Spain's first US Open champion. He dedicated his triumph to the country's golfing pioneer five-time major winner Seve Ballesteros who died in 2011. The Athletic Bilbao football fanatic told Golf Channel ""I have a hard time explaining what just happened because I can't even believe I made the last two putts. ""This was definitely for Seve. I know he tried a lot and usually we think a lot about him in the Masters but I know he wanted to win this one most of all.""

A disappointing opening round at Royal St George's wrecked his hopes of back-to-back majors at the Open but four consecutive birdies on the back nine saw him take a share of third four strokes behind winner Collin Morikawa. The pair were set to meet again in Tokyo with Morikawa needing a win to take over as world number one. Rahm's absence means he will remain top of the rankings regardless of what happens in Tokyo. The event will be without the last two US Open champions after Bryson DeChambeau also tested positive for Covid. Rio 2016 Olympian Patrick Reed will replace DeChambeau for Team USA after Patrick Cantlay and Brooks Koepka declined invitations having been next in line.

Why does Jon Rahm have a short swing? Rahm is one of the biggest hitters on the PGA Tour despite having a shorter swing than most of his peers. He revealed why in a press conference before the Open hitting back at those who claimed he had ""tight hips"". ""I was born with a club foot on my right leg. My foot was 90 degrees turned inside and basically upside down. When I was born they pretty much broke every bone in the ankle and I was casted within 20 minutes of being born from the knee down. ""Every week I had to go back to the hospital to get recasted so from the knee down my leg didn't grow at the same rate. So I have very limited ankle mobility on my right leg. It's a centimetre and a half shorter as well. ""I can't take a full swing because my ankle doesn't have the mobility or the stability to take it. So I learned at a very young age that I'm going to be more efficient at creating power and be consistent from a short swing."" As well as his ankle issues Rahm has wrists which are almost inflexible outwards but hypermobile inwards enabling him to 'bow' his wrists and generate power in the downswing. ""Let your body dictate how you can swing. Simple as that."" - Jon Rahm

Arnaus ""pumped up"" for Olympic chance Like Rahm Adri Arnaus played golf at college in the United States. The Barcelona native went to Texas A&M University from 2012 to 2016 before taking the Spanish amateur title the following year. That success persuaded him to turn pro and follow the trail blazed by Ballesteros."

The company was established by scientist Acharya P.C. Ray and industrialist Manab Mitra in the year 1901 .

Aiming to make India self-reliant ('Atmanirbhar') when it came to chemicals and pharmaceutical products the company has seen many ups and downs since coming about. A recent Rs 400 crore revival package led to the company being profitable in the past couple of years with the number hitting Rs 130.7 crores in FY 2020. Since 2016 the company has been making regular profits now said Mrinal Roy Choudhury general secretary of the CITU-affilated Bengal Chemicals Workers' & Employees Union.

BCPL’s products — Bengal Chemical Pheneol naphthalene balls Cantharidine hair oil Kalmegh and Aqua Ptychotis —still command a market share through the company’s own retail outlets opened recently modern trade and on e-commerce sites. It was also among the first Indian manufacturers of anti-snake venom.

'Atmanirbhar Bharat' -- A 'Frivolous' Campaign

The company which began its journey on April 12 1901 from Maniktala in Kolkata now has factories and sales units in Kanpur Mumbai and most of the bigger cities. Various life saving drugs and Sulfuric acid an important chemical for the industry are important products made by Bengal Chemicals. Choudhury said that the ""self-reliance"" that the PM speaks about is not in action as the Centre was ""trying to hive off the prestigious industry"" despite it being a profit-making concern with heritage value. ""The attempt to sell the concern shows the hollowness of the PM's 'Atmanirbhar Bharat' campaign"" Choudhury told Newsclick.

Present Position

Post-2016 the Central Government had embarked on the goal of a strategic sale of the concern. With this aim it tried to hive off 25 acres of land that belonged to the factory at Panihati which is expected to fetch over Rs 1000 crore. Till 2011 the Left Front Government ensured that BCPL was not harmed. However since 2011 the TMC run state government has shown little interest in putting pressure on the Centre. However the unions wrote to the PM on multiple occasions to not hive off BCPL. A protest note was also sent to the PMO on behalf of the workers and employees of the concern .

Litigation Won

At the same time a case was filed in the Calutta High Court seeking its intervention in the matter. In February 2018 a verdict was delivered by a single-judge bench of Calcutta High Court striking down the strategic sale of BCPL. High court judge Debangsu Basak had ruled that Bengal Chemicals should not have been classified as a low priority public enterprise. The Centre in April 2018 had moved the division bench challenging the verdict. The proceedings are still being continued in Calcutta HC.

West Bengal Governments Role

The present government in Bengal does not seem too keen on BCPL with urban local bodies and corporations not buying its products. The company and the union had approached the state Government in this regard with its product quality said to be superior in comparison to what competitors produce.

The Standing Committee on Chemicals & Fertilizers in its latest report has strongly advocated that BCPL continues making its products since they were profitable concerns even during COVID-19 times. It has urged the Centre to rethink its moves but insiders say that the Niti Aayog is opposed to it.

Government Strategy Now

Though at the moment the Government has been unable to sell the concern due to it being mired in litigation. However with no Managing Director in place and due to ""half-hearted"" management the concern may die a natutral death.

The company revealed details of their WD_BLACK SN750 special edition bundle which comes with a Battlefield 2042 PC game code. Gamers in select countries can preorder their bundle now from the Western Digital Store and at select retailers with a $114.99 MSRP (500GB bundle) and $179.99 MSRP (1TB bundle) in the United States.

The limited-edition bundle includes:

1x Battlefield 2042-themed WD_BLACK SN750 SE NVMe SSD drive

1x Full Battlefield 2042 Standard Edition PC Game Code (redeemable with the game’s release on October 22 2021)

Access to preorder benefits including in-game content when using the PC game code before game availability

“The WD_BLACK brand’s reputation as a leader in gaming storage solutions along with its commitment to providing players the best gaming experience through its high-quality line of performance SSDs led us to team up with Western Digital as the official Gaming Storage Partner for Battlefield 2042” said Kabir Kumar Sr. Brand Director at EA.

“EA and DICE are committed to ensuring Battlefield players have the best gaming experience— a mission which drives our WD_BLACK brand” said Susan Park vice president of Product Marketing Western Digital. “Battlefield 2042 brings a vast new world full of immersive maps and dynamic gameplay to the FPS genre and we’re excited to be a part of this bold new chapter.”

It’s puzzling that Western Digital decided to go with the SN750 model rather than its newer SN850 but you’re still getting a fast drive that will surely cut down on game launch times. The special edition drive even features a Battlefield 2042 logo on it – just for that little bit extra level of branding.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvcmVhbC1lc3RhdGUvc3R1ZGlvLWNpdHktdG93bmhvdXNlcy1kaWdpdGFsLWNyZWF0b3JzLTEyMzQ5ODQ4Nzkv0gFvaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaG9sbHl3b29kcmVwb3J0ZXIuY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9yZWFsLWVzdGF0ZS9zdHVkaW8tY2l0eS10b3duaG91c2VzLWRpZ2l0YWwtY3JlYXRvcnMtMTIzNDk4NDg3OS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New Studio City Townhouses Draw Digital Creators Thanks to Hybrid Zoning,"An interior at Thirty Four Fifty West listed with The Agency

The next evolution in creator houses is here — and legal: Thirty Four Fifty West is a collection of townhouses starting at $1.015 million where the light-filled multifloor units all have rare-for-Los-Angeles live/work zoning approval.

Located at the edge of Studio City across from Universal Studios Thirty Four Fifty West has hybrid zoning that permits people to have a full professional office or creative studio with industrial grade electrical and the like in spaces where they can also live in luxury. The technical zoning designation is C2-1-VL which means the base zoning is general commercial with the 1-VL classification permitting a live-work use.

According to Hana Cha at The Agency Development Group 12 units have sold in 12 weeks to buyers including TikTok and YouTube creators. (Three more are in escrow.)

“We’ve had a tremendous response from creatives who are responding to the location and flexibility of the live-work setup” says Guy Penini principal at BLDG Partners the company that developed and owns the building. “The residences are self-contained studios where buyers can shoot edit and produce work without leaving their home base [and] with tons of privacy and great light.” Most buyers use the first and second stories as creative office areas reserving the third floor as private residential.

Internet personality Andrew “King Bach” Bachelor is among the buyers at the project. “The convenient location … is what attracted me to the space” he says. “I immediately fell in love with the functionalities of the unit. It is the perfect space to create relax and get business done.”

For residents Malika and Zac Lim Eubank co-founders of content studio Hyper Rabbit Media the ability to have a state-of-the-art studio was a strong draw. “Having four floors facilitates work-life balance and aids in keeping up with the demands of social media and live-streaming” says Malika. “The commercial build of the location allowed us the amount of electrical power we needed to power all our production hardware including our LED video wall.”

Artist Lyle Owerko at work in his unit. “Everyone who works here finds it … an amazing environment to work at every day” he says. “It’s been both an investment in lifestyle and community.” Jason Speth

Western Poland on Fuji Fujicolor C200 in a $20 Fed-5B + Industar 61-L/D 55mm f/2.8,"My first roll really was a first roll. I’m an amateur photographer now but at the time I had no previous experience with photography in either digital OR film. It all started from a Reddit Christmas gift exchange I signed up for in 2014. It entailed pairing random strangers from across the globe with each other and required both parties to buy gifts based on the other’s interests.

My gift partner listed many interests and hobbies one of which intrigued me – analog photography. How strange? Armed with a budget of only $20 I fired up eBay to look for something “analog photography” related. This is when I discovered the magical world of second-hand cameras such a wide selection and for so cheap! I purchased an old Soviet Fed-5B rangefinder camera and proud of my fantastic gift I sent it off in the mail.

A part of me felt unsettled though I became so deeply curious as to if such a camera would even function and what the images might look like that I immediately bought a second one for myself. Being a broke student at the time and having just spent $40 I was insistent on buying the cheapest film I could get my hands on – which at the time was Fuji’s Fujicolor C200 in 24 exposure rolls for about $3 a roll. So while I waited for my camera and film to arrive I watched some Youtube tutorials on how to load film into my particular camera as well as some basics. I learned about ISO F-stop shutter speed the Sunny 16 rule and minimum shutter speed to avoid camera shake.

Now the images I include here are genuinely my very first images from that first shorty roll of Fuji C200 from which I got 20 images. The pictures were taken over a rainy weekend in my town in western Poland. My only intention when setting out for the first time was to get to the centre of the old town and take some pictures of the beautiful old architecture found there. Now one of the quirks of the Fed-5B is that you need to cock the shutter before changing the shutter speed in order to avoid horribly damaging the fragile Soviet internal mechanism.

Other interesting reads





















As a result I remember the disappointment I felt when I accidentally bumped my camera and fired off a blurry shot while waiting to cross the street. I loved learning how to use this tool squinting through the dark and tiny viewfinder to see the split image motivated me to take more photographs. I remember wanting to test what different settings were like so I took a few double shots in this roll – preserving the same exposure but shooting at different f-stops.

I do this at the river after which I walk past a literal “bread-line” of people queuing at a bakery (above) so I snap a quick shot on my way to the local bazaar. I make my way to the “love-lock bridge” where I took my first step into the buttery land of bokeh by taking two more shots at f/2.8 and f/4 (below). These at the time were the best and most pleasing images I had taken and fully cemented my commitment to photography.





















Nowadays I still used rangefinders mostly a Leica M6 — is a far cry from my humble eyeball-straining beginnings with the Fed-5B — although I still wholeheartedly recommend that camera to any new photographers wanting a cheap fun and satisfying first taste at film rangefinder photography. Sadly I no longer have my original Fed-5B and I now have to live with the deep searing guilt of having sold my trusty steed. Still $20 is $20.

Now Justin Laboy has provided an update. In a post shared to social media the internet personality announces that the rapper’s tenth studio album has been pushed back a couple of weeks and is set to arrive on August 6.

“Kanye West will move the release date of Donda to August 6th” he writes. “Thanks for your patience he wants to give his fans the best possible product without rushing anything. He loves yall with all of his heart. God bless #Donda.”

While there’s no official confirmation from Kanye himself (and clearly any date should be taken with a pinch of salt) Laboy does appear to have some amount of insight into the project. Alongside basketball player Kevin Durant he was treated to a play-through of the album last week ahead of the public event in Atlanta.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpLmNvbS9zb2NjZXIvMjAyMS8wNy8yNS9rYW55ZS13ZXN0LWF0bGFudGEtdW5pdGVkLWZjLWdhbWUtbmV3LWFsYnVtLWRvbmRh0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kanye West joins Atlanta United fans at Mercedes-Benz Stadium,"Kanye West fans were likely disappointed when July 23—the reported release date for West's new album ""DONDA""—came and went with no such album. Two days after hosting a live listening party at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta West returned to the venue on Saturday for a different reason: to take in a soccer game.

West was in the stands as Atlanta United FC took on the Columbus Crew wearing what appeared to be the same outfit he donned during Thursday's event. He even got an up close and personal view of the home club's support group the Terminus Legion.

West is reportedly finishing up the album in a studio built in the arena according to ESPN's Jeff Carlisle so depending on how long it takes him to finish this might not the last time he gets to see Atlanta United FC in person. The listening party for ""DONDA"" was announced in an ad featuring U.S. track and field star Sha'Carri Richardson.

Despite some A-list support on hand Atlanta was defeated by Columbus 1-0.

Good-Loop founded by ad agency exec Amy Williams and software engineer and tech consultant Daniel Winterstein in 2016 is building up an impressive client base with companies such as Nestlé Nike and Unilever. The core product of Good-Loop is a platform that works by rewarding viewers of video ads by allowing them to donate 50% of the media spend of the ad to a charity provided they watch part of the ad.

The benefit to advertisers is not only that they get to support a charity of their choice – and since launch more than £2m has been raised for charities – but Good-Loop also claims the ethical aspect means consumers are more engaged as they watch.

Recently the company has turned its attention to the sustainability space launching its “green ad tag” which lets advertisers monitor and offset the carbon cost of their digital campaigns in real time and the offer of a carbon calculator to help brands and agencies work out the footprint of their online ads.

Last year the company closed a $1.4m seed-funding round with investors including You & Mr Jones and is running at 200% year-on-year growth for the first two quarters of 2021.

Freshed out

Williams (pictured below) who has only just turned 30 started out as a graduate at Ogilvy and for a while that was fine.

“For the first few years of my career I was just exactly where I wanted to be and I was building brands and learning as much as I could. When you're straight out of uni you just want to make friends go to the glitzy office bar and have a good time” she says.

dir=""ltr"">

But she became interested in sustainability while working on the Unilever account at a time that coincided with the FMCG giant ramping up its ethical credentials. It was however a lengthy internal workshop that triggered an epiphany.

“We had a three-day workshop on the importance of freshness and by the end of day three I was like this doesn't seem important” Williams says. Instead she was more interested in Unilever’s work around reducing water usage for clothes washing.

So she quit Ogilvy and worked in a pub to allow her to focus on developing her concept which was based on the idea of “doing good at scale”.

It was fair from plain sailing; Williams admits to “existential angst” about whether she had done the right thing by throwing her career away.

“I had a couple of failed attempts at finding business partners and then at the very last attempt 10 months into this year of nothing I posted on a forum called ‘Work in startups’ and Daniel read my posts and he got in touch” she recalls.

The pair met up and hit it off immediately. After three months they had gone into business together. “I came from this very commercial world I understood purpose as a proposition and I knew how to talk to brands about it but he knew how to build [the platform] as he had been building white-label adtech for other companies” Williams says.

The turning point for the pair came when she persuaded street-food operation Kerb to become Good-Loop’s first client. After that Williams was able to take a live case study to Unilever; it bought into the vision and it took off from there.

New alliances

Good-Loop is now a business that employs 21 people and has offices in Edinburgh and London.

Brands that have worked with the startup include Nike PepsiCo and Nestlé the latter through its Cheerios cereal brand on both sides of the Atlantic. Recently the company has also worked with Adidas on a campaign around its Stan Smith sustainable sneakers.

Williams says that about half of the brands to have used its platform have deployed creative linked to their values in some way.

“We actually did a test recently with a brand in the US they had two pieces of creative with one that was explicitly purposeful. Their purpose is all around protecting and preserving national parks and then they had one that was more product-focused. The results were really interesting.The product-focus creative actually had higher ad recall. But the purposeful piece had higher affinity and loyalty higher likeliness to recommend to a friend” Williams says.

One unexpected challenge has been the matchmaking process with charities. Some clients such as Dove have had very clear ideas about whom they wish to support (UN Women or the Dove Self-Esteem Project) but for others it has been left to Good-Loop to make the connections.

“One of the first things I learned is that giving free money to charities isn't as easy as you think. There's a lot of nuance – and rightly so as charities need to protect their brand and they need to make sure that they're partnering with businesses that they truly believe in and reinforce what they stand for.”

She gives the example of WWF one of Good-Loop’s biggest charitable partners. As a “fully vegetarian” charity it has turned down the opportunity to work with sustainable meat businesses who wanted to partner it.

“It’s right that WWF protects that integrity and we can help make sure that their brand finds an alternative that is a better fit” she says.

After being reliant on Williams tapping up brand-side contacts to bring in new business in the past few years Good-Loop has made inroads into media agencies which she says were wary of “this warm fuzzy charity thing when they have performance metrics to hit”.

Williams tells how after winning a competition to work on a KitKat campaign with Zenith Good-Loop was able to build a deeper relationship with the agency. Zenith was recently reappointed to the Nestlé business.

“Really the true prize of that achievement was that it got us into Zenith and it proved to them that we knew our shit and we deliver good results.” Now the agency is one of Good-Loop’s biggest customers and has used its platform for its other clients besides Nestlé.

On a journey

Good-Loop now has its eye on US growth. It plans to set up an office there in 2022 with US business accounting for 48% of its revenue.

The other priority Williams says is looking at the area of sustainable adtech. This push includes products such as the green ad tag and the carbon calculator and making sure brands' efforts on diversity and inclusion are reflected in their ad buying and not accidentally preventing their media spend from supporting LGBTQ+ content through block lists.

But while there is a busy pipeline of innovations in the offing the core product is still key.

Williams concludes: “At the very heart of this is this simple ad format that helps consumers use their eyeballs and their attention to do a little bit of good in collaboration with advertisers and that will never change.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiczE3LmNvbS9uZXdzL25vcnRoLWNhcm9saW5hLW5ld3MvMi1kZWFkLTEtaW5qdXJlZC1pbi1zaG9vdGluZy1hdC1uYy1jb2FzdGFsLWhvbWUtb2YtY29vLW9mLXRydS1jb2xvcnMtYnJld2luZy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2 dead 1 injured in shooting at Wilmington home of TRU Colors Brewing executive,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://www.cbs17.com/news/north-carolina-news/2-dead-1-injured-in-shooting-at-nc-coastal-home-of-coo-of-tru-colors-brewing/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiczE3LmNvbS9uZXdzL25vcnRoLWNhcm9saW5hLW5ld3MvMi1kZWFkLTEtaW5qdXJlZC1pbi1zaG9vdGluZy1hdC1uYy1jb2FzdGFsLWhvbWUtb2YtY29vLW9mLXRydS1jb2xvcnMtYnJld2luZy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRjZC5pZS9pbm5vdmF0aW9uL25ld3MtaXRlbXMvRGVjbGFuSVBQb2RjYXN0LnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,- Trinity Innovation,"

“Being a university that values and promotes academic entrepreneurship and innovation is incredibly important and we have that at Trinity”:

Dr Declan Weldon Head of the Office of Corporate Partnership and Knowledge Exchange (OCPKE) at Trinity College Dublin discusses opportunities for industry engagement

“OCPKE is an integrated team between industry consultancy and knowledge transfer a team that is professional and passionate.” Dr Declan Weldon leads this team which develops and supports relationships between industry and Trinity academics. Declan was recently invited to feature on the Tech Transfer IP Forum podcast which provides “in-depth analysis of intellectual property issues related to university and non-profit technology transfer.” The podcast is hosted by Lisa Mueller a thought leader on life science patent law and has previously featured primarily American speakers with Declan being the first contributor from Ireland invited to join. The conversation illuminated the achievements of the OCPKE team at Trinity College Dublin over the past five years and emphasises Ireland as key location for investors with Trinity as a hub for innovation and entrepreneurship.

Technology transfer can be thought of as the movement of information inventions materials or software from one organisation – in this case a university Trinity College Dublin – to another organisation often a company working on a project or developing an idea. It is related to “knowledge transfer” which encompasses the knowledge and scholarship from the Arts Humanities and Social Sciences in a university as well as science mathematics engineering and technology. At Trinity OCPKE puts the processes and structures in place to make such transference possible with highly beneficial results for both the university and the organisations involved.

The team’s mission according to Declan is “to promote Trinity as the partner of choice for industry in business to support access to Trinity intellectual property and to provide services to companies based on the wealth of knowledge and expertise available at the university.” The team has in place a “world-class infrastructure for industry collaboration whether that’s with global multinationals like Johnson and Johnson or with indigenous Irish companies and small to medium enterprises looking for assistance.”

Trinity has for example the latest MRI imaging equipment to develop medical device technology which many companies and organisations would find very valuable to access. Declan emphasises that as well as the equipment Trinity has “an academic community that is keen to work with industry and sees the distinct benefits of doing so and how that translates into more success in research funding and better teaching experiences for students.”



Declan has come “full circle” in returning to Trinity having completed his PhD in Chemistry at Trinity in the 1990s gone on to work for a company called Air Products & Chemicals in the U.S. Britain China and in Europe before returning to Trinity for this new role in technology and knowledge transfer. His team which are based within the larger team of Trinity Research and Innovation contains a wealth of experience and expertise from academic perspectives and backgrounds and also from the perspective of business industry engagement the protection and commercialisation of intellectual property (IP) and the legal necessities required for protected and structured relationships between industry and a university.

There are four managers on the team with expertise in specific areas to help academics at Trinity apply their research and IP to work with companies both in Ireland and internationally on a wide variety of projects. Dr Gordon Elliott looks after health sciences. Emma O’Neill works with academics from Life Sciences Biochemistry and Immunology. Dr Graham McMullin is responsible for Engineering Physics Chemistry and the Trinity centres AMBER and CONNECT. And Dr John Whelan works on Information and Communications Technology as well as the ADAPT and CONNECT centres.

They all work alongside the Licensing Manager Dr Sam Williams who is responsible for negotiating and finalising IP licence agreements across all disciplines as well as with paralegal officers Kate Toner and Lyn O’Reilly who look after legal agreements to cover confidential discussions and the sharing of data and materials. A key team member is Neil Gordon the Start-up Development Manager who is at the centre of relationship-building and advising Trinity academics who want to spin out their own company.

This team works together with the Industry Development Team spearheaded by Dr Chris Keely with the expertise of Audrey Crosbie and Dr Juan Valverde and soon to be joined by Tony O’Callaghan who is moving from Operations Executive into a leading new role in data analytics. Aoife Tierney is also leading in a new and exciting role in IP Development Management scoping out the IP landscape and identifying possibilities for progress.

Alongside this is the relatively newly-formed academic consultancy office CONSULT Trinity where Dr Joanne Conroy and Dr Kate Smyth support academics to apply their knowledge and expertise to various organisations including charities and Government departments.

Declan states that the team “really believes that there's great value for investors at Trinity College Dublin. We make it easy for our academic community industry partners and public service to work together. Our mission is to make it as open as possible for everyone to collaborate.” He says that “in the previous five years we've completed just over around 600 industry engagements with a wide variety of clients. One of our most important corporate relationships is with Intel Ireland who have repeatedly invested in fundamental research at Trinity which in turn then adds to Intel’s research roadmap.” So it can be very much a mutually beneficial relationship.

This work is supported by Enterprise Ireland which “offers a range of supports specifically aimed at developing research into commercialization potential at university. They are the primary source of funding for creating spin-outs from research in Ireland and typically a commercialization fund would be between 400 to 800000 Euros.” There is also European funding available from the European Research Council and from Horizon Europe which is “very much a gold standard in Europe” according to Declan. So he states “from the project in the lab to a commercialization stage there's a very healthy ecosystem here in Ireland to do that.” He also mentions the University Bridge Fund which was a fund “specifically aimed at spinouts from Irish universities.” It is a 60 million Euro fund built collectively by Irish universities and managed by Atlantic Bridge. The 25 companies involved in the previous five years “have raised 120 million Euro in equity and non-equity funding proving that the scheme is very successful.” Declan also mentions the support of Knowledge Transfer Ireland and its leader Allison Campbell who he says “has really been responsible for an uplift in knowledge transfer performance.”

He mentions the value of CONSULT Trinity as academic consultancy projects are often the “very first engagement the client will have with the university.” It allows for relationship-building and also provides opportunities to branch outside of traditional STEM sectors. CONSULT Trinity is branching out to offer support to academics from the Arts Humanities and Social Sciences (AHSS) to work with various organisations from SMEs to large multinationals to charities to Government departments. “Consultancy is a fantastic window into those Schools in AHSS to see what they're interested in doing and how they wish to work. And we're using that as a platform to expand activities into the Arts Humanities and Social Sciences.”

In the course of the conversation Declan discusses various new initiatives and activities that the team are working on and groups they’re collaborating with. One example is the Bush Institute in the Southern Methodist University in Dallas with whom the team is working to improve methods of measuring success and efficiency. Another major initiative is the Licensing Executives Society International. OCPKE Licensing Manager Sam Williams is the Ambassador for Britain & Ireland for the Women in Licensing Association (WILA) whose mission is to advance the growth of women in leadership through education mentoring and networking opportunities in the area of licensing. Improving gender equality in the field is a priority for the OCPKE team and for Trinity College Dublin more broadly with initiatives such as ATHENA SWAN ongoing which is “a recognition and reward system for positive gender practices in education.” Sam is a key leader in the successful licensing of IP and Declan states that “30% of our licensing repeat business and that's people saying we got value the first time.”

In the podcast Declan discusses significant successes in terms of Trinity campus companies such as Inflazome from Professor Luke O’Neill – now highly-regarded by the Irish public for his advice and expertise in relation to COVID-19 – and Matt Cooper from the University of Queensland. Their company was sold to Roche in 2020 “for an upfront payment of 380 million Euro” Declan states. This has significant benefits for the public because the company is “developing drugs that treat a whole range of chronic diseases all caused by inflammation so it’s really important that these drugs get to the market because tens of millions of people will benefit.”

Declan’s team are now looking at a new round of funding from the Technology Transfer Strengthening Initiative through Knowledge Transfer Ireland and are excited to see what possibilities lie ahead.

The Morgan County Sheriff’s Office said Sunday in its morning update that “all operations to this coal fire emergency have been turned over to Xcel Energy Savage Industries and their contracted Emergency Response Team.” Savage Industries is the contractor that deals with electrical equipment and controls for the coal handling operations at the Xcel Energy power plant.

The announcement followed an evacuation of most of the plant’s employees on Friday as the fire which reportedly started July 14 intensified despite ongoing efforts by the Brush Volunteer Fire Department and other agencies to suppress the blaze.

The power plant was shut down Friday due to the fire Xcel Energy spokeswoman Michelle Aguayo confirmed. In an emailed statement Aguayo said the plant would remain out of service pending further assessment but that the shutdown should not result in any disruption of electrical service.

BVFD Assistant Chief Ray Uhrick told The Fort Morgan Times last week that they had been notified of the fire on July 19. According to Uhrick there were 23000 tons of coal in the storage facility and the conveyor belt needed to move the coal outside the building was inoperable and awaiting a part for repair. Vacuum trucks had been deployed to try to move the coal.

On Saturday the MCSO’s morning update said the fire which is contained within the storage facility “has surpassed traditional suppression efforts” and those efforts were being suspended “due to life safety factor.”

“The coal fire is contained to the live storage facility but is not controlled” the MCSO update read

The update also stated that air monitoring stations had been requested and would be set up in Brush and Fort Morgan.

In Sunday’s update the MCSO noted that they along with Brush fire crews would continue to be available to respond to the power plant if asked. The Colorado Division of Fire Prevention and Control was standing down assisting agencies but also will be available.

Road closures related to the fire on Morgan County Road 24 and MCR Q have been lifted the MCSO stated.

“Xcel Energy reiterates that they feel there is no immediate risk to the general public” the update reads.

The sheriff’s office said it did not plan to release any further updates on the fire; any future released would come from Xcel Energy.

According to a document on the Colorado Legislature’s website the Pawnee Station is a “coal-fired steam-electric generation station” that began commercial operation in 1981. In 1994 a baghouse that vacuums particulate emissions from the flue gas was installed and new controls to further reduce emissions of nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide were installed in 2014.

Xcel Energy in March announced plans to convert the power plant from coal to natural gas fuel by 2028 as part of its Clean Energy Plan to retire all coal use in Colorado by 2040.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmt2cnIuY29tLzIwMjEvMDcvMjQvZm9yY2VzLWphY2stcGVhcnQtYW5kLXRyaXN0YW4tYnJvei10YWtlbi1pbi1uaGwtZHJhZnQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Force's Jack Peart And Tristan Broz Taken In NHL Draft,"Force’s Jack Peart And Tristan Broz Taken In NHL Draft

Both players were selected in the 2nd round on Saturday afternoon

FARGO ND (KVRR) – Fargo Force’s Jack Peart grew up in Minnesota played hockey in the FM area and is committed to Saint Cloud State. After that he’ll have the opportunity to continue playing in his home state. The defensemen was taken 54th overall by the Wild in the 2nd round of the 2021 NHL Entry Draft making him the 15th Minnesota native to be selected by the club and the first in seventeen years. It comes after the Saint Cloud State commit tallied seven points this past postseason tied for the most. Xcel Energy Center is where he’s always wanted to be.

“I mean you kind of black out when it happens” Peart said. “It didn’t feel real honestly. It’s always been a dream of mine to play for the Minnesota Wild for sure. That’s the NHL team I watched growing up and just for me to get drafted by them and have a chance to play for them it’s been really special for sure.”

He’s not the only former Force to hear his name called. Minnesota commit Tristan Broz was selected by the Pittsburgh Penguins in the 2nd round (58th overall). The 6’0 forward finished with 51 points last season the 12th most across the USHL. He had eleven more in the playoffs good for the second most. Broz is a Minnesota guy so the natural assumption would be he’s a Wild fan right? Not so fast.

“It’s been pretty hard to describe honestly” Broz said. “Its been such a whirlwind of emotions the entire day. I’m just really thankful for the Penguins organization drafting me. It’s pretty funny actually a lot of people might say this but I truly have since I was a little kid been a big penguins fan. I always loved Crosby when I was younger so it kind of feels a little full circle.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvc3RidWxsZXRpbi5jb20vc3BvcnRzL2Zyb20tYnlyb24tdG8tdGhlLW5obC1kb2RnZS1jb3VudHlzLWJyb2R5LWxhbWItZHJhZnRlZC1pbi00dGgtcm91bmQtYnktbmV3LXlvcmstcmFuZ2Vyc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,From Byron to the NHL: Dodge County's Brody Lamb drafted in 4th round by New York Rangers,"Brody Lamb was sitting in the living room of his family’s house just outside of Byron on Saturday afternoon watching the live feed of the 2021 NHL Draft. His parents Jeff and Melissa were there too as were close to a dozen of his Dodge County boys hockey teammates.

Then Brody’s phone buzzed with a text message from one of his teammates with the USHL’s Green Bay Gamblers.

Lamb wasn’t sure if he should believe the message or not. After all he hadn’t yet received a phone call confirming that he had been drafted. Then just seconds later his name flashed up on his TV screen: Round 4 Pick No. 8 by the New York Rangers.

“We live out in the country and our wifi can be spotty” Jeff Lamb said with a laugh. “We were halfway panicking that we were going to have to go out and bang on the box.”

Instead of panic there were high-fives and hugs dozens more text messages and a congratulatory phone call from Rangers’ Director of Player Development Jed Ortmeyer. New York had just made Brody the first-ever NHL Draft pick from the Dodge County program.

Dodge County head coach Nick Worden heard the news as he was driving with his family to northern Minnesota for a vacation. Based on conversations he had with NHL scouts during the high school season Worden said he thought the Rangers as well as Los Angeles Philadelphia and Winnipeg might be the best bets to select the 6-foot 165-pound Lamb a forward who is still just 17. He’ll turn 18 on Aug. 30.

“I was probably getting (calls from) five or six (NHL) teams a week during our season and for two months after the season and frequent calls from four or five teams who were really interested” Worden said. “The scouts all loved his skill level and they realized how young he is. I talked a lot to them that Brody’s just a different creature. I’ve had the opportunity to be around a lot of hockey players in my life and I haven’t met too many kids like him.”

Lamb who will be a high school senior this fall will play junior hockey for Green Bay of the USHL in the 2021-22 season. He is committed to play Division I college hockey at the University of Minnesota though his arrival date in Minneapolis is not yet certain.

Lamb was named the Minnesota Associated Press Boys Hockey Player of the Year as a junior for the 2020-21 season after he led the state in goals scored (52) and points (87).

Lamb likely cemented that honor with his performance at the Class A state tournament when he led Dodge County to the state championship game where it fell to Gentry Academy. Lamb finished the three-game state tournament run with 10 goals including an eye-popping six goals in a 7-3 state quarterfinals victory against Hermantown. He added a hat trick in a 4-1 semifinals win against Little Falls and he scored the Wildcats’ lone goal in the state title game loss to powerful Gentry Academy.

“He’s only 17 hasn’t really fully come into his body yet” Worden said. “His upside is tremendous. That’s the most exciting part. His hockey IQ is high that’s a hard thing to teach. It’s something he has and has worked hard to improve.”

In two high school seasons Lamb recorded 101 goals and 58 assists for 159 points. He helped the Wildcats go 19-4-1 in the pandemic-shortened 2020-21 season leading them to their first ever Section 1A championship and first-ever state tournament appearance.

Lamb scored at least one goal in 23 of Dodge County’s 24 games. He had 16 multi-goal games including seven hat tricks. His six goals in the state-tournament opener against Hermantown were his season high and he had a five-goal game at St. Cloud Cathedral during the regular season.

The 2021 EliteProspects.com NHL Draft Guide offered this scouting report on Lamb:

“The core of Lamb’s effectiveness is his shooting ability and passing skill. He explodes through his shot transferring his weight over the puck before rolling his wrists through the release. Although he looks to shoot more than pass he’s an efficient playmaker who finds teammates on the weak side draws in pressure and uses hook and slip passes to connect.”

Another Lamb drafted

Jeff Lamb said everyone gathered at their house Saturday were unsure as to when Brody’s name might get called.

“We had been told by Brody’s advisor and had a pretty good indication that several teams were very interested” Jeff Lamb said. “Brody had talked to probably 20-24 teams and we were expecting that he was going to get drafted in the later rounds. We were told anywhere between the third and fifth rounds at one point. It could’ve easily been the sixth or seventh.

“You just never know. It’s the first time we’ve been through this. We were hopeful but weren’t really expecting anything.”

While Brody became the first-ever Dodge County player to be drafted he also became the second member of his immediate family to be drafted. Jeff Lamb was selected in the 1986 NHL Supplemental Draft (which was held during the season) by the Pittsburgh Penguins which was a much different experience than what his son had on Saturday afternoon.

“I was in college at the time I slipped through the underage draft” Jeff Lamb said. “I don’t think anyone knew who I was when I was 18. I was a late bloomer came together with my game in my early 20s. I was a junior in college when they had this supplement draft — they only had it for a few years.

“We’d heard rumblings about the (supplemental) draft and it was the first year they’d had it. I came off the ice from practice one day and my coach (at Denver University) Ralph Backstrom told me ‘hey you just got drafted by the Pittsburgh Penguins.’”

A fun time-consuming process

Brody Lamb his coaches and parents had conversations with scouts or personnel directors from nearly 75 percent of the teams in the NHL leading up to the draft.

Among the conversations Jeff Lamb had in the months prior to Saturday were talks with Rangers head European scout Nick Bobrov and the team’s Director of Player Personnel Gordie Clark who had coached Jeff during his days as a player for the Maine Mariners of the American Hockey League in the late 1980s.

In other words it wasn’t a complete surprise that the Rangers made the move to draft Brody before others could.

“I had talked to Nick Bobrov about a month and a half ago … and he was really high on Brody. He told me they’d like to get him if they could” Jeff Lamb said. “Gordie I hadn’t talked to him in 30 years but he called one day (last spring) when Melissa and I were driving to Green Bay. We talked to him for 45 minutes and he had a lot of good things to say too.

“We had a good feeling about New York but you never know. It’s not totally a surprise but some teams talked to Brody a lot more.”

Much like the college recruiting process Jeff Lamb said Brody enjoyed the process of talking with NHL teams in advance of the draft though it became time consuming at times. The process in some cases included lengthy interviews with various members of teams’ front offices as well as psychological testing.

“Some of those psychological tests would take an hour or more” Jeff said. “He’d have to answer questions like ‘would you rather be a cat or a dog and why?’ And there were a lot of character questions about what he’s like in school and what he’s like off the ice.

“It was very fun very time-consuming but Brody didn’t complain.”

Worden said he is equally happy for Lamb’s teammates his classmates who’ll be seniors for Dodge County this winter and who were right there with Lamb through PeeWees and a Bantam state tournament.

“I’m excited for our program” Worden said. “I don’t care what it does for me as a coach if anything. I’m just excited for the program and all of his buddies those 10-12 kids who were at his house today with him. All those kids who are going to be seniors this year and were on that Bantam team and who grew up with Brody.

“They deserve to enjoy this as much as Brody is. They’ve pushed him along and encouraged him. Today is for all those guys too.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnR3aW5jaXRpZXMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDcvMjQvd2lsZC1zZWxlY3QtbWlubmVzb3RhLW1yLWhvY2tleS13aW5uZXItamFjay1wZWFydC1pbi1zZWNvbmQtcm91bmQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wild select Minnesota Mr. Hockey winner Jack Peart in second round of NHL draft,"To place an obituary please include the information from the obituary checklist below in an email to obits@pioneerpress.com.

Earlier IBM came out with positive numbers for its most recent quarter on Monday. The next day all eyes were on streaming giant Netflix which published mixed results in the after-hours.

Energy firm Kinder Morgan Seagate Technology Verizon soft drink major Coca-Cola and Johnson & Johnson stole the show on Wednesday. Thursday was as busy as usual with the major events being the second-quarter earnings releases of telecom firm AT&T fast-food chain Domino’s Pizza Biogen Abbott Laboratories Intel as well as social networking platforms Twitter and Snap. Schlumberger American Express and Kimberly-Clark reported Friday before the opening bell.

While Lockheed Martin is probably the only major company to report earnings on July 26 the market will be closely following the report of Alphabet on July 27. The Google parent will be joined by gadget giant Apple chipmaker AMD Starbucks and Microsoft in the after-hours. Before the opening bell aviation firm JetBlue and engineering behemoth General Electric are scheduled to report earnings.

The financial releases of Bristol-Myers Squibb aircraft builder Boeing and Ford Motor are the key events slated for July 28. The next day is going to be as hectic when the earnings announcements of e-commerce giant Amazon.com Altria Group Yum! Brands and Merck & Co. are on tap.

The implications of higher inflation and COVID-19 infection rates for the food industry

A recent Food Institute study found that among G20 economies countries with higher COVID-19 infection rates are experiencing higher inflation. With that what are the implications for the food industry? Let’s take a closer look.

Higher inflation and COVID-19 infection rates

The Federal Reserve acknowledged that inflation has increased “notably” and COVID-19 still poses risks to the recovery. At the center of the current inflation debate is the question of when will the pandemic be contained to the degree that the economy can return to “normalcy.” Waves of the pandemic especially the surging Delta variant created uncertainties for the economy. And these uncertainties exacerbated the mismatch between supply and demand which in turn sparked inflation growth.

In The Food Institute study we found that among G20 economies countries that have been more affected by the pandemic are experiencing higher rates of inflation. In the initial study we divided the countries into two groups by the number of COVID-19 cases as well as the infection rate (number of COVID-19 cases / number of tests). Then computed the average inflation rate for each group based on each country’s latest CPI or similar measure. In further analysis we excluded outliers (countries that had extremely high or low inflation prior to the pandemic). In other words their high/low rate of inflation is not necessarily a result of the pandemic.

After excluding outliers the first group (high COVID-19 cases) had an average inflation rate of 5.31% and the second group (low cases) had an average inflation rate of 1.68%. In other words consumer price increases among high-infection countries were more than triple those of low-infection countries. Moreover when compared to 2019 (i.e. pre-pandemic) the first group experienced an increase in inflation by 1.52% while the second group experienced a decrease in inflation by 0.28%.

Public health policy changes and implications for the food industry

The recent surge of Delta variant cases suggests that the U.S. has entered a fourth wave of the pandemic. Pending FDA’s full approval businesses and government agencies will likely require vaccinations for their employees and customers.

In the U.K. the government will launch daily COVID testing of food sector workers to tackle its ‘pingdemic.”

In France the government requires “vaccine passport” for anyone who wants to enter a theater museum theme park cultural center shopping mall train bus restaurant bar or cafe.

In China the government partnered with McDonald’s to offer free ice cream to boost its vaccination efforts.

A number of food-related companies are stepping up ahead of government mandates:

ALDI Chobani Darden Restaurants McDonald’s Starbucks Target and Trader Joe’s are providing paid time off for vaccinations.

Amazon Lidl Bolthouse Farms Instacart JBS USA Pilgrim’s and Kroger are giving employees cash bonuses to get vaccinated.

Amazon is also providing on-site vaccination for its U.S. front-line employees. Bolthouse Farms and Houston’s Legacy Restaurants hosted vaccine “pop-ups.”

Michelin-starred restaurant Eleven Madison Park requires all workers to be vaccinated.

Safety and Mobility are keys to return to normalcy

In a recent update of the “Anticipated Vaccine Adoption & Impact on the CPG Industry” report IRI pointed out that consumers’ willingness to restore normal work and shopping patterns will depend on vaccine adoption. Understanding the evolution of social mobility is key to assess demand and supply in the foreseeable future. In the framework of a “new normal” IRI’s current forecast of resuming “normal” mobility is summer 2022.

Projecting future inflation is a more difficult task. “I think trying to predict where inflation is going to be in a few years is a mug’s game” said Kristin Forbes an economist at M.I.T. and a former official at the United States Treasury and the Bank of England. “Policymakers need to be ready for different scenarios…If things recover faster than expected we know how to deal with that. If things don’t recover that’s a harder situation.” The longer and to a greater degree that the pandemic can’t be contained the more challenging it will be for both consumers and businesses.

A three-story addition currently under construction on the east side of the plant at 601 W. Cornhusker Highway will house space for production as well as research and development for monoclonal antibody drugs.

Monoclonal antibodies which are proteins made in a laboratory that mimic the body's immune response came into the spotlight last year as a potential treatment for COVID-19 infections but they've been used for years for treating cancer and autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis.

Zoetis currently makes two monoclonal antibody drugs for dogs in Lincoln — Cytopoint a skin treatment and Librela a treatment for arthritis.

Cytopoint has been licensed for use in the U.S. since 2016 and the company mentioned its importance in driving a 36% year-over-year increase in first-quarter sales in its companion animal segment.

Librela is a much newer drug that was approved for use in Europe just last fall. Approval in the U.S. is still pending.

""The company's making the investment to be able to make more"" of those products said Chris Rasmussen who has been general manager of the Lincoln Zoetis plant since January.

Rasmussen declined to give the size or cost of the expansion citing competitive reasons but said it should be completed sometime in 2023.

He said this will be the fifth expansion of the plant in the past six years a sign of how important the Lincoln site is to Zoetis' ongoing plans.

Zoetis which was spun off as a separate company from Pfizer in 2013 has spent more than $100 million to add space at the Lincoln plant for the production of both livestock and companion animal vaccines. In fact a 2016 expansion on the west side of the plant facilitated the initial production of Cytopoint.

Those physical expansions have brought with them the need for more workers too. When it was spun off as its own company eight years ago Zoetis had about 550 employees in Lincoln. Rasmussen said that number is now more than 700 and the latest expansion will result in the addition of another 20 to 40 positions.

""I'm really excited about it"" he said.

The oldest zoo in America and New Jersey-based pharmaceutical company Zoetis are awaiting approval from the state to vaccinate animals with a COVID-19 vaccine after it received authorization from the United States Department of Agriculture for experimental use.

Dr. Keith Hinshaw veterinarian and Director of Animal Health at the Philadelphia Zoo said they’re excited to have their animals vaccinated though they haven’t seen any cases of COVID-19 from any of its animals.

“It adds a level of comfort that we can provide some extra protection to our animals even though we do a lot of other things to protect them” Dr. Hinshaw said.",,,,,,,,,
