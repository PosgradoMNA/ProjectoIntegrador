BURNLEY are ready to test the water with a bid for Sunderland’s midfield dynamo Dan Neil.

Clarets’ chief scout Martin Hodge watched the 20-year-old in action at Arsenal in the League Cup and the home-grown youngster impressed.

The Turf Moor outfit’s American owners are willing to invest in some rising stars with future value and Neil is in their sights as an ideal target.

League One Black Cats may sell if the price is right and Burnley have done rigorous background tests in the last few days ahead of an opening offer.

Burnley may try their luck at around £3million for the England Under-20 cap — and possibly even do a deal to buy him and return him to Wearside on loan for the promotion campaign.

Meanwhile Thomas Frank's Brentford could go to £14million in their bid to land Nottingham Forest wideman Brennan Johnson.

However that might still not be enough to do a deal.

The Bees have been buzzing round Johnson 20 for months.

His form has tempted the Prem new boys to reignite their interest and come up with a better offer.

Arsenal Tottenham and newly-rich Newcastle have all been linked with the Wales international.

But Forest are keen to get promotion this season from the Championship.

They are happy to risk it even if it means Johnson running down his contract and entering the final year.

And sources close to the deal also reveal Johnson would rather wait to see if an even bigger team came in for him amid reported interest from Arsenal and Tottenham.

Kent County Council (KCC) is planning to allocate £3million to ""temporarily"" enlarge three sites so extra pupils can be taken from next September 2022 and the following year.

Westlands School Sittingbourne (53877913)

The schools are Westlands in Westlands Avenue The Sittingbourne School in Swanstree Avenue and Fulston Manor in Brenchley Road.

KCC has identified the need for extra secondary places across Swale which includes Sheppey and Faversham because new housing developments are boosting the borough's population. Parents on the Isle of Sheppey are also sending their children to the mainland.

Education chiefs stressed the need for swift action as they fear a shortfall of 176 spaces for Year 7 starters in September 2023.

A KCC report warns: ""To help meet the predicted pressure on places in Sittingbourne the proposal is to temporarily expand Westlands The Sittingbourne School and Fulston Manor for September 2022 and September 2023.""

It adds: ""There is a need to secure a permanent solution to the secondary place pressures from September 2024 onwards and options are being investigated.""

An additional 30 Year 7 places would be provided at Westlands another 30 at The Sittingbourne School and 15 at Fulston Manor.

More than 4600 pupils are currently studying at the three sites.

The report says: ""Proposals to meet the shorter term pressures are being brought forward after discussion with the local secondary schools.""

In its budget KCC has allocated around £1m for each of the school expansions.

Meanwhile developers have put forward a proposal to create a new primary and secondary school off Quinton Road Kemsley by September 2028.

There are two confirmed cases of Covid-19 at The Sittingbourne School in Swanstree Avenue. Picture: Google (53878081)

But concerns have been raised because the start date for supporting housing to pay for the new schools has been put back by developers putting pressure on existing schools.

Additional pressure on Sittingbourne's non-selective schools is coming from Sheppey parents who opt to send their children off the Island instead of to Oasis Academy Isle of Sheppey.

Every day more than 1200 pupils are ferried to Sittingbourne on a fleet of buses.

KCC's education committee is to discuss the matter on January 11.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN1bi5jby51ay93ZWItc3Rvcmllcy90aGUtZ3JhbmRlc3QtZ3JhbmQtZGVzaWducy1ob21lcy_SAUZodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVzdW4uY28udWsvd2ViLXN0b3JpZXMvdGhlLWdyYW5kZXN0LWdyYW5kLWRlc2lnbnMtaG9tZXMv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,THE GRANDEST GRAND DESIGNS HOMES,Bram and Lisa V's house in the Isle of Wight ended up being £2million over budget and required them to take out 11 loans to fund their architectural dreams.

But Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has other plans (to build a wall). And apparently Biden also has other plans (to build some more wall).This week Abbott debuted a section of the border wall in Starr County a whopping 900 feet’s worth. The Republican governor announced his plans to finish Trump’s wall as part of a large-scale effort to crack down on the number of migrants crossing the frontier.“We’re going to spend as much as it takes to build as much wall as we possibly can ” Abbott said as reported by the. The governor has reportedly set aside $1 billion for the barrier but details are still murky theadded. Those funds are mostly taxpayer cash but some of it comes from private donations.Meanwhile President Biden paused the border wall axed contracts with builders and started giving back land to private owners early on during his presidency.But this week the Department of Defense announced that it would be embarking on a big construction project on the U.S.-Mexico border. To that end the department will reinforce some parts of the Trump wall and close “small gaps that remain open from prior construction activities and remediating incomplete gates.”The gaps to be filled in are in areas including San Diego El Centro Yuma Tucson El Paso and Del Rio. The administration says they will not build any new sections of the wall however.In other words the Biden administration will be building “another foot” — or several — of border wall. Earlier this year the Department of Defense denied that it was building additional wall on the border after activists sounded the alarm over new construction in the Rio Grande Valley But hey maybe filling in gaps in an existing border wall doesn’t mean the same thing as building more wall in the Biden administration’s eyes. Who knows?In the meantime Gov. Abbott says more than 730 miles of the Texas-Mexico border could need a barrier theadded. To get that done property owners — most of the Texas borderlands are privately owned — will have to decide if they care more about their property rights or the long shot that a wall will actually keep anyone out.For Abbott’s sake he better hope they’re willing to give up land. Otherwise how would the governor keep out all the South Africans who aren’t in fact crossing the border ? (Of course apprehensions on the border are spiking  but the uptick started when Trump was still president.),https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN1bmpvdXJuYWwuY29tLzIwMjEvMTIvMjQvYW5lbW9pYWMtcmVjb2xsZWN0aW9ucy1vZi1mYXJtaW5ndG9ucy1wYXN0LW5pZ2h0LXRoYXQta2lsbGVkLXRoZS1hYmJvdHQtc2Nob29sL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Anemoiac Recollections of Farmington's past: Night that killed the Abbott School,"Merry Christmas everyone! As folks gather around the fire with their families this Christmas remember that periodic chimney maintenance is incredibly important. If your chimney is full of soot and creosote it can cause a dangerous chimney fire. This is precisely what happened at the Abbott School Dormitory on one cold December night in 1917. Old South Congregational Church Reverend Paul Gordon Favor (you may remember him as the pastor who got lost up on Mount Blue with a bunch of youngsters in September of that year) gave a detailed account of the fire. So this month we will join Rev. Favor on that fateful night. Let us go back…

It is the night of December 6 1917. The Great War is raging in Europe and just earlier today the city of Halifax Nova Scotia experienced an explosion that was the result of the collision of two ships with over 1500 people dead (this was one of the largest non-nuclear explosions in history). Sometime between 9:30 and 10 two blasts of the fire alarm are heard in the vicinity of the Abbott School for Boys. Rev. Favor puts on his boots and a jacket and books it in the direction of the school.

Arriving before the fire department Favor meets up with Abbott School Athletic Director Ralph W. Roberts. The dormitory of the school is on fire with flames escaping from a chimney. Upon meeting Coach Roberts the two men traverse the burning building reaching a ladder leading to a skylight on the roof. Several of the stronger Abbott Boys are also there carrying extra fire extinguishers. The coach and the reverend climb up the ladder and onto the roof.

Now on the roof of the burning building Favor and Roberts go through about a dozen fire extinguishers while fighting the blaze tossing them to the ground when they are depleted. At first the snow on the roof keeps the fire somewhat manageable. Once the snow has melted however the blaze soon burns out of control. Soon both men are enveloped in thick smoke. In a hasty retreat Roberts instructs Favor to crawl backwards on the ridge-line of the roof back to the skylight.

The reverend goes too far and misses the skylight while Coach tumbles down the fiery opening singeing his hair and eyebrows. At this point Favor needs to make a decision: stay up on the roof and succumb to the flames and smoke or jump into the fiery hole to escape. Roberts calls up to Favor “Come on Favor! You must man. You must. Quick or too late!” The reverend hears the voice of God telling him to jump and he does. At the bottom of the ladder Coach Roberts catches Rev. Favor. In the coach’s arms Favor looks over and remarks “Thank you old man you saved me.” The two men then evacuate the burning building.

Fortunately nobody was injured or killed in the burning of the Abbott School Dormitory. Roberts and Favor’s effort helped save half of the building while the back half was gutted. The fire department did arrive but as the temperatures were near zero the water lines were frozen. Most of the boys lost their belongings in the fire and some furniture was damaged from trying to move it out of the building. Headmaster Church sent the young men of Abbott home for Christmas early.

It’s important to note that this was the night that killed the Abbott School. With a burned dormitory (which the United States Government would not allow to be renovated to the extent that the headmaster wanted due to war rationing of materials) along with most male teachers being away in the war Headmaster Church had to close the school at the end of the 1917-1918 school year. While the Abbott School eventually did reopen in the early 1920s it wasn’t as successful as it had been under the leadership of George Dudley Church. The school closed permanently around 1930 after an unsuccessful rebranding as the “Abbott Junior College” in 1928 and as an effect of the Great Depression (Story sourced from the Lewiston Daily Sun 1917).

Layne Nason is a Farmington historian specializing in the history of the Abbott School for Boys and Farmington during the era of the Great War.

The Fortress) in Dalworthington Gardens Texas. Check out the one-and-a-half-minute video below.

Back in February 2015 as part of Guitar World's coverage of the tenth anniversary of the guitarist's tragic death the magazine was invited into Dimebag's home and recording studio — and they got to bring their cameras. Guitar World's exclusive video tour which can also be found below offered a private look at Dimebag's impressive guitar collection not to mention his home memorabilia kitchen bathrooms and a lot more.

Abbott one of the most beloved and respected musicians in hard rock was shot onstage during a DAMAGEPLAN concert on December 8 2004 at the Alrosa Villa club in Columbus Ohio by a 25-year-old ex-Marine named Nathan Gale. Gale murdered a total of four people and wounded three others before being killed himself by police officer James D. Niggemeyer who arrived on the scene minutes after Gale began his rampage.

According to The Pulse Of Radio Gale seemed to deliberately target Abbott leading to speculation that the young man who had a history of mental illness held a grudge against Abbott and his brother drummer Vinnie Paul for the break-up of PANTERA in 2002. Columbus police closed their investigation in October of 2005 without establishing a motive for the shootings.

Abbott and Paul formed PANTERA in the mid-Eighties in Texas. The band recorded four independent albums before their 1990 major label debut ""Cowboys From Hell"" introduced a heavier sound and made them a favorite with metal fans. 1994's ""Far Beyond Driven"" debuted at No. 1 on The Billboard 200 without benefit of a commercial hit single.

The group splintered in 2002 following the departure of volatile lead singer Philip Anselmo. Dime and Vinnie as they were known to their fans regrouped with DAMAGEPLAN releasing the band's debut album ""New Found Power"" in February of 2004. The group was touring in support of the record at the time of the shootings.

Abbott's death was a devastating blow to the close-knit hard rock and metal community. He was known to his fellow musicians for his hospitality friendship and partying spirit and was a legend among fans and peers for his powerful innovative and unmistakable playing style.

Vinnie Paul died in June 2018 at the age of 54 in his sleep at his home in Las Vegas. The official cause of death was dilated cardiomyopathy an enlarged heart as well as severe coronary artery disease. He was buried next to his brother and their mother Carolyn at Moore Memorial Gardens cemetery in Arlington Texas.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm91dHNpZGV0aGViZWx0d2F5LmNvbS9hYmJvdHQtYW5kLXRoZS1ib3JkZXItd2FsbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Abbott and the Border Wall – Outside the Beltway,"Abbott and the Border Wall

The governor of Texas vows to finish what Trump started.

Steven L. Taylor · · 22 comments

The Texas Tribune reports: Gov. Greg Abbott has touted the state’s efforts to build a border wall but many details remain a mystery

On Saturday Gov. Greg Abbott unveiled nearly 900 feet of newly constructed border barrier on state-owned land near the Rio Grande in Starr County six months after he promised to finish what President Donald Trump started. It was the first section of what’s expected to be a nearly 2-mile stretch of wall and it followed a series of smaller-scale state attempts to block immigrants with chain-link fences a row of shipping containers and even a boat blockade on the river. But after the Trump administration managed to build just 21 miles of new border barrier on the 1254-mile Texas-Mexico border over four years (and also replaced 34 miles of older barrier) the state hasn’t publicly disclosed some basic information about Abbott’s wall-building plans.

Several questions persist in my mind on this topic:

Is this worth the expense? Is this in any way feasible? Is this even efficacious policy? What about property rights? Who benefits the most from this?

Let’s start with questions #1 and #2 and stipulate for the moment (before getting to #3) that as the phrase goes walls work. What will this cost?

The barrier being erected in Starr County offers the first insights into how the state will carry out Abbott’s wall project. In November the Facilities Commission awarded a $162 million contract to New York-based Posillico Civil Inc. to build 8 miles of border barrier including the 1.7-mile stretch in Starr County that the Facilities Commission said will cost $34.5 million. That’s just over $20 million a mile. By comparison border wall construction under the Trump administration ranged from $6 million to $34 million per mile according to a Texas Tribune analysis. Abbott has said that 733 miles of the Texas-Mexico border may need some type of barrier. Roughly 1000 miles have no barrier. With the $1.05 billion the state has for construction — most of it taxpayer money but it includes $54 million in private donations as of Dec. 13 — Texas could build just over 52 miles of border barrier at that price per mile.

At $20 million a mile 733 miles would cost $16.7 billion (and that does not include maintenance nor the fact that the price of steel is currently going up up up). Using what is likely the most expensive estimate of the cost of illegal immigration to the state of Texas it would take almost twenty years to recoup those saving assuming 100% efficacy (and somehow magic deportations). That is using AG Paxton’s estimate that illegal immigrants cost Texas $850 million per year in state services. So $16.9 billion divided by $850 million gives us 19.83 years of spending to equalize assuming perfection. But of course the wall would not mean a perfect stoppage of illegal immigration (first a huge chunk–roughly half–of it is via overstayers not people crossing the Rio Grande in the dead of night and second there are ways to thwart a wall). Further one has to know what economic benefits are being generated by these folks (such as tax revenue and general economic activity) if one is going to come up with a real cost figure.

In sum: if a fantasy scenario (zero maintenance costs perfect execution an assumed zero benefit from immigrants and magic deportations at some point) means the wall doesn’t pay for itself in two decades then there is no reality in which building a wall is a good investment if the goal is actually about stopping/slowing illegal border crossings because immigrants cost citizens too much.

Please also note for whatever it might the worth that the story talks about the unveiling of 900 new feet of a projected 2-mile new section with a contract for 8 miles.

Of course there are the broader questions of whether there aren’t better uses for those funds beyond this narrow topic.

Further in regards to question #2 since the Trump administration managed all of 21 new miles of fencing is there any conceivable circumstance wherein 733 miles get built along the Texas border by the state?

Even if cost and feasibility are somehow dealt with what about question #3: how efficacious will it be? The answer is not anywhere near the level promised. Again as noted above roughly half of the undocumented are people who entered legally and then stayed longer than they should have under the law. A perfect wall will not change any of that.

And of course walls aren’t perfect. We know that people can go over them under them and even through them. Sometimes the wind takes them out.

The numbers show (see this post from 2018) that a major driver for the wave of migrants has been the various crises in Central America. A well won’t change those desperate conditions nor will they stop desperate people from attempting desperate actions.

All of this is fantasy regardless of one’s views of immigration. I would submit that even the most diehard anti-immigration proponent should oppose the wall on efficacy and cost grounds. If one wants to stop illegal immigration there are far better ways to spend the dollars. Or if one is a true limited government conservative this ought to spark some concern (especially with question #4 about private property–how much land seizure will this require?).

Texas will need a large amount of private land to build Abbott’s wall. The governor has said state officials are in talks with private property owners along the border who are willing to donate their land so the state can build barriers on their property. The state manages 497075 acres of land within 25 miles of the border said Matt Atwood a spokesperson for Texas Land Commissioner George P. Bush who has sued the Biden administration for halting construction of the border wall in South Texas. In Starr County Posillico Civil plans to build an additional 1.2 miles on private property next to the 1.7-mile stretch but no agreement has been reached with nearby landowners said Francoise Luca a Facilities Commission spokesperson. The location of the remaining 5.1 miles outlined in the Posillico contract has not been determined Luca said.

Is it too snarky to note that these distances are essentially irrelevant? Let’s say I have made the trip from San Salvador to the doorstep of Starr County Texas. I have traveled almost 1500 miles. Are another 1.2 miles or even 5.1 miles going to deter me?

By the way some US citizens are finding themselves on the wrong side of the fence which seems like a weird policy design if you ask me. It certainly isn’t pro-citizen.

I am trying to mainly provide bare facts and not get overly normative but the sheer imbecility of this policy is overwhelming (as I have noted more than once).

But wait you say what about stopping drugs? A Fox News piece noted the following from Abbott:

He also raised the fentanyl crisis saying that state authorities have seized “enough fentanyl to kill every man woman and child in Texas California New York Illinois and Florida combined.”

Sure but first this is a non sequitur. That lots of drugs have been seized does not mean that a wall would stop them. Most likely those drugs were seized mostly at established crossings (which is where most drugs enter). Moreover drugs are easier to get over under or through walls/fences than are people. Bringing up drugs is just scare tactics/a bait-and-switch.

All of the comes down to #5 (who benefits?) and the answer is clearly Abbott. In the short term he is seeking re-election and fear-mongering over the border sells to enough voters to make it worth his while. He may also have other ambitions (every governor especially of large states at least fleetingly think of running for president). Most people are not going to spend even a few minutes doing the math (let alone on Christmas Eve!*) but rather those inclined to like this sort of thing will simply see action (and promises kept even if they are performative in nature).

It would seem that performative xenophobia trumps efficacy. Again even if one is a diehard on limiting illegal immigration this is not the best way to accomplish the goal. This all about symbolism and the perception of “doing something” rather than anything else. It is a cartoon version of immigration policy.

It also shows how a silly slogan “build the wall” can take on a life of its own (like much of Trumpism has done). See this Forbes piece: Where The Idea For Donald Trump’s Wall Came From for more on the origins of the notion.

The governor of Texas is directing nearly $40m in additional public funds for projects related to his desire to finish former president Donald Trump’s aborted wall along the US-Mexico border.

Governor Greg Abbott on Friday said the Lone Star State has begun construction on roughly $38m worth of state-funded sections of border barriers built on state-owned land. The barriers which are built by the same materials and methods as Mr Trump’s border barrier using the same contractor purportedly fill in gaps in the barriers constructed on federal land during the Trump administration.

In September Mr Abbott signed legislation allocating nearly $2bn towards various purported border security projects with $750m going to barrier construction in addition to a quarter-billion approved last summer as part of another $1.05bn border appropriations bill.

Mr Abbott and other Republicans frequently claim President Joe Biden has enacted an “open border” policy because he stopped construction of the border barrier — a pet project of Mr Trump and his hardline immigration adviser Stephen Miller — and has tried to reverse Trump-era policies meant to make it more difficult for nonwhite migrants from South and Central America to claim asylum in the United States a right guaranteed under both US and international law.

On Friday Mr Abbott retweeted a Fox News reporter’s tweet sharing photos of the state-funded barrier along with the comment: “Biden allows open border policies and refuses to enforce laws passed by Congress to secure the border and enforce immigration laws”.

“Texas is stepping up to do the federal government’s job” he added.

In reality neither Mr Biden nor his administration advocate for an “open borders” policy but the term has long been used by Republicans to describe any immigration policy under which nonwhite immigrants are permitted to claim asylum after reaching American territory.

Mr Abbott has also enacted other policies which purport to enforce federal immigration law —something he as a state official has no jurisdiction over — including using state law enforcement to arrest asylum seekers for trespassing so they can be jailed.

In July the Department of Justice sued Mr Abbott and the state of Texas after he signed an order directing the Texas Department of Public Safety to stop vehicles suspected of carrying migrants and turn them back towards the US-Mexico border.

Earlier this month more than 100 immigrant and civil rights groups filed a 50-page complaint asking Attorney General Merrick Garland to intervene to end Mr Abbott’s migrant trespassing arrest policy by cutting off a significant portion of Texas’ federal funds.

Led by the American Civil Liberties Union the groups have accused Texas of creating “what is in reality a system of state immigration enforcement that targets Black and Brown– primarily Latinx– individuals for prosecution and enhanced punishment”.

“Texas has created a separate criminal prosecution and detention system for these individuals with separate criminal dockets separate public defender assignments separate jails (converted state prisons) and even a separate “criminal migrant processing facility” for booking. This separate system is riddled with civil rights violations including failure to appoint counsel failure to timely file charges and even the unilateral replacement of judges” they wrote."

The holidays are one of the busiest times on Australian roads – and it’s not only cars that are out and about. NRMA Insurance’s new campaign via The Monkeys part of Accenture Interactive is a reminder to look out for kids taking their new wheels for a spin this Christmas.

‘New Wheels’ follows young Australians waking up on Christmas morning and heading onto their neighbourhood roads to test out their first bike first set of rollerblades or first skateboard.

NRMA Insurance’s ‘New Wheels’ goes to air on Christmas Day and will run across broadcast television cinema and online. The campaign film is directed by Leilani Croucher of Revolver.

Says Sally Kiernan executive manager direct brands NRMA Insurance: “Sadly Australia has seen a significant increase in child road deaths this year. We hope people will enjoy the nostalgic joy of this film but more importantly we hope it reminds drivers to be safe these holidays and to keep an eye out for those heading – or wobbling – onto the road on their new wheels.”

Says Tara Ford chief creative officer The Monkeys: “To spread the message of driving safely during the holiday season we show the joyous transformation of an Australian neighbourhood on Christmas morning. With the streets becoming the testing ground for new wheels and new freedoms so too comes new reasons to drive safely.”

Stephanie Spitere from The Lough and David (Dave) Lee first met 11 years ago at a 21st birthday party in Sully’s pub in Dave’s native Donoughmore. “We met at the bar getting a drink and hit it off straight away” said Stephanie.

Seven years later Dave whisked Stephanie to Paris.

“He had organised for a photographer to meet us at the Eiffel Tower on the night of November 11 2017 but when we got there it was lashing rain” said Stephanie.

Not knowing that Dave had a marriage proposal in mind Stephanie flagged a taxi. “He had arranged with the hotel to have our room decorated for when we came back — so he had to get down on one knee and pop the question as I was opening the bedroom door” she said.

Stephanie Spitere and David Lee had their wedding reception at Garryvoe Hotel

Like many couples planning their wedding in pandemic times they had to rearrange the date several times. “We bought a house in Kerry Pike together in July as we had to postpone our wedding three times — so we decided to buy a house instead while we waited” said Stephanie.

“Our original date was May 9 2020 and thank God it all went ahead on October 7 2021 and the day was amazing! There was a storm called Sam [Hurricane Sam] on the day but the rain didn't make any difference to us” said the bride.

Stephanie Spitere and David Lee were married at Lough Church by Father John Paul Hegarty

They exchanged vows in the Lough Church where Father John Paul Hegarty led the Mass and they celebrated with a reception in the Garryvoe Hotel.

Photographers Laura and Benny Benson of Laura and Benny Photography www.lauraandbennyphotography.com were behind the lens. “Laura and Benny just made our day so magical and it was full of laughter because of them” said Stephanie. “Our videographer was Gordon Falvey from WedFilms and he was amazing!” Family and friends at the wedding of Stephanie Spitere and David Lee

The bride’s grandmother Breda Spitere turned 91 the week before the big day: “She didn’t stop dancing from the drinks reception when the singer Conor O’Sullivan The Lounge Man performed to the meal when the singing waiter Dickie from Singers Secreto performed to the band and DJ (Electric Circus and Patrick Ahern)! She is so young at heart and is such an amazing woman.""

“We were extremely lucky to get live music back before our date which just made our day. Our church singer was Julie O’Sullivan whose singing was the highlight of the occasion.”

Also sending her good wishes was Dave’s grandmother Birdie who was unable to attend due to illness that week.

Toasting to their future happiness were the bride’s parents Patricia and Noel Spitere and the groom’s mother and father Philomena and Eddie Lee.

Stephanie’s friend Lucy Keohane was her maid of honour; and her friends Mairead Barry and Ciara O’Rahilly were her bridesmaids. Dave’s friend Gary Fagan was his best man; and his brother Darren Lee and friend Philip Foley were by his side as groomsmen.

Stephanie Spitere wore a Pronovias dress from Say I Do in Midleton and David Lee is in a Louis Copeland suit

Stephanie looked stunning in a Pronovias dress sourced in Say I Do in Midleton while Dave was dapper in a Louis Copeland suit.

The bridal hairstyling was by Kim Moynihan (Hair by Kim) and the makeup was by Susan Casey (Crazydolls Makeup Artists).

The florist was Elizabeth Cott (Wonderous Weddings) while To Have and To Hold decorated the church and reception venue.

The newlyweds had booked a honeymoon in South Africa Mauritius and Dubai but it was cancelled due to Covid. “We went on a road trip around Italy for two weeks. We then had five days in Paris (our favourite place) including three days in Disneyland as I am a huge Disney fan” said Stephanie.

The bride is a dental nurse in the Cork Dental Hospital’s orthodontic department and Dave is a senior manager with Accenture.

We speak to Ashaita Mahajan one of the co-founders to understand their work with people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDDs).

It has been seven odd years since Mumbai-based Aarti Nagarkar (35) moved back to India from the States but ask her about her favourite things in life and she says without hesitation �Chipotle Mexican Grill and relaxing while watching The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon!�

While Aarti�s workplace is barely a five-minute walk from her residence in Juhu she takes a secluded route on the insides of the upmarket neighbourhood to avoid its regular commotion. As a person with autism she abides by three golden rules � no to fireworks barking dogs and loud crowds.

She is among the 18 full-time employees at Caf� Arpan a one-of-its-kind establishment where all servers kitchen and counter assistants have some kind of intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDDs). The Caf� was set up in 2018 by the Yash Charitable Trust (YCT) a city-based NGO that has been providing skill development and livelihood opportunities to adults with IDDs since 2014.

It was heavily inspired by one Puzzle Caf� in Manila Philippines opened by a couple to offer a safe working environment for their autistic son says Ashaita Mahajan Aarti�s cousin and co-founder of Caf� Arpan.

�Aarti and I were born six days apart and share an extremely special bond. Soon after she moved back to Mumbai her mother Sushama founded the YCT on the pillars of acceptance empowerment and inclusion. I quit my job in the culture sector to come on board as an active trustee in 2017. A year later my aunt and I opened the Caf� to offer a live demonstration of what is possible if PwIDDs are provided with the opportunity to lead a dignified life� Ashaita tells The Better India.

It is estimated that 3 per cent of India�s population or 31 million individuals live with IDDs as per a ResearchGate report. Covering a wide spectrum of conditions such as autism Asperger’s syndrome down syndrome and cerebral palsy IDDs often present at birth and distinctively impact an individual�s physical intellectual emotional and/or social skills.

�There are so many organisations that exclusively work towards providing interventional support to children with disabilities. But the reality is they all grow up to be adults who can�t be expected to continue functioning within [the safety of] special schools. Yes there are some people on the autism spectrum who are high-functioning and capable of going to college eventually leading fairly �normal� lives. But others like Aarti wouldn�t be able to get a job in the open market easily� she notes. �At the same time they have so many strengths and all they need is a boost of confidence and a platform that allows them to showcase their skills.�

From a �Dabba� Service to a City Hub

Located across the SNDT Women’s University�s Juhu campus in Santacruz West Caf� Arpan plays host to dozens of customers every day who wander in for its inhouse focaccia bread sandwiches methi puri chaat nachni wraps hummus and falafel among other small bites and hot & cold beverages.

�We also offer plenty of gluten-free vegan and Jain options. The Caf� has a lovely aroma of coffee at all times thanks to our star beverage-maker Anand who measures all ingredients to the �t�. We�ve been told several times that his cold coffee is the best our customers have had in the city� says Ashaita.

�Our head chef Aaron who is autistic has the memory of an elephant. He remembers all our recipes by heart but we mostly approach him to remind us of everyone�s birthdays� she adds with a laugh.

Customers at Caf� Arpan are usually greeted and seated by Aarti who works as a server. Occasionally however she also sings to customers she hits it off with. �I take classes in opera western and Hindustani classical music and also play the piano. Someday I�m going to be a superstar singer� she grins.

Meanwhile a bulk of the orders and the Caf�s regular earnings are handled by Nikhil Sharma (40) one of the two counter assistants at Caf� Arpan who has Asperger’s syndrome. �Sometimes I get angry and anxious when I think of the past but I calm down when I remember [the coping mechanisms taught to me by] my father. It makes me happy to be a working man. I pay close attention to how the manager works and eventually I could also become one� he says.

Even as Caf� Arpan now enjoys an excellent reputation in the neighbourhood its humble beginnings are to be traced to a dabba (tiffin) service launched by YCT in 2015 with a team of only four members including Aarti.

�We had decided to convert a family-owned garage in Juhu to a small kitchen and collaborated with a home chef starting with catering to her existing customers. Before we knew it we had gone viral on WhatsApp. By 2017 we had about 15 members and the kitchen was starting to become crowded. That�s when we first started conceptualising Caf� Arpan� says Ashaita adding that the tiffin service was later rebranded to Arpan Food Services.

�Another key element that was missing was that team members couldn�t interact with our customers for too long. We knew that they looked forward to making the deliveries because they used to fight about it. Now at Caf� Arpan they�ve emerged as social butterflies � so many of our customers specifically enquire about particular members� shifts just so they can come in to meet them� she adds.

Even as the YCT primarily relied on the family�s personal network for monetary support the trustees launched a fundraising campaign on ImpactGuru to raise additional money for setting up Caf� Arpan. Within the first two weeks they had raised Rs 5 lakh.

�The response was overwhelmingly positive. By the end of five months we had managed to raise Rs 12 lakh and we were extremely cautious on how to spend the money. We faced some discrimination in terms of procuring the location as some landlords were not willing to rent a space to an NGO working with differently-abled adults. As luck would have it we found the perfect space next to our garage which could operate as a back-end kitchen until the Caf�s construction was completed� she says.

While Ashaita�s sister-in-law undertook the designing of the Caf�s interiors a friend took care of its branding Meanwhile a fellow YCT trustee�s son-in-law designed the initial menu. On 2 August 2018 the establishment was inaugurated by noted filmmaker Kiran Rao � all thanks to Aarti.

�Back in April (2018) Aarti was invited to be a panellist at an independent documentary festival in Colaba and she happened to sit next to Kiran Rao who was a moderator at the event. Charmed by her words Kiran later invited us to her dressing room and Aarti spontaneously invited her to the inauguration. We kept in touch and months later she showed up� recalls Ashaita.

With the YCT being fortunate enough to receive ample media attention and support from individuals Ashaita says that several families gradually started approaching them to seek employment opportunities for their adult sons and daughters with IDDs.

�So in 2019 we decided to launch a skill development centre. Presently we have about four trainers leading enrichment therapies by way of music dance art and craft yoga and other physical fitness activities. Of the 32 PwIDDs associated with us 18 are salaried employees who work rotating shifts to split their time between the Arpan Food Services and the Caf�. We�re also training two women to become trainers so that it might help in possible expansions in the future� she adds.

The only requisites they look for she says is that candidates must have a disability certificate and be able to independently use the washroom. At the skill centre they are given lessons on both interpersonal communication and industry practices.

�We recently had two team members from the skill centre graduate to working for the Arpan Food Services. Given the right guidance and support PwIDDs can function perfectly fine. We don�t want their families and society to see them as a burden or have them waste away a shot at a meaningful life� she says.

The Way Ahead

Owing to growing disability inclusion at Indian workplaces in recent times Caf� Arpan has also been approached by other food-based organisations to hire PwIDDs.

�We�ve been very lucky to place a team member at a restaurant who has been included in their workplace beautifully; his team members absolutely adore him. On the other hand another young man was not only denied adequate opportunities but was exposed to pornographic material. But you wouldn�t be able to tell this if you met him now; he has so much potential and does wonderful work for the community. It�s heartbreaking to come across these negative instances but all the more important to highlight the positive ones� she notes.

Last year Ashaita says that Caf� Arpan got a glimpse of what they hope is in store for them in the future. The establishment was approached by the Vikhroli office of Accenture in January 2020 to run an in-house Caf� for over 3000 of their employees.

�It was one of the best experiences we�ve had in the history of YCT. Not only was a corporation bringing us on board on an equal footing they were also providing us free space bearing transportation costs and a steady stream of customers. We had the opportunity to work for them for about three months until the COVID-19 outbreak hit India. They haven�t resumed physical hours at full capacity yet but we�ve been told we�ll get a chance to resume our services once they do� she says.

�People keep asking me when we�re opening more outlets of Caf� Arpan. I tell them I�d be happy to open a pop-up in every corner of the country so long as they sponsor us� she laughs.

Retouching using artificial intelligence is not new but it’s definitely an area that was still waiting for major improvements before it could begin to compete with the skills of an experienced retoucher. Dinda has put together a comparison that shows the potential of three new Photoshop plugins and is blown away by the results. Right now the three plugins will cost you around $320.

Artificial intelligence will continue to change photography and like Dinda I’m also slightly critical of Adobe’s odd approach to implementing it into their software presenting half-complete solutions that seem more like novelty items rather than useful tools that fit seamlessly into one of the most important professional-level software packages ever created. For example a few weeks ago I asked why photo-editing software hasn’t been developed to automatically remove sensor dirt when ingesting images. If deep learning can be taught to differentiate between noise and detail surely it can be taught to differentiate between sky and dust. While Adobe is busy making people look old and adding weird smiles Luminar Neo looks to be ahead of the game.

Will you check out the plugins from Retouch4me?

After defrosting cooked turkey meat you should eat the leftovers within 24 hours. The NHS says: “Never refreeze raw meat (including poultry) or fish that has been defrosted.

“You can cook frozen meat and fish once defrosted and then refreeze them. You can refreeze cooked meat and fish once as long as they have been cooled before going into the freeze.

“If in doubt do not refreeze.”

What other Christmas foods can you freeze?

You might be surprised to find out there are loads of your holiday leftovers that will keep well in the freezer. Classic Christmas dinner vegetables like potatoes carrots parsnips and Brussels sprouts that have been cooked can all be frozen.

If you have leftover vegetables that weren’t cooked you can blanch items like carrots parsnips and Brussels sprouts in boiling water for a few minutes before placing them in ice water cooled and then frozen.

Brussels sprouts can be divisive at Christmas - but just because they haven’t been eaten doesn’t mean you have to throw them away (Photo: Shutterstock)

Leftover Christmas pudding doesn’t have to go to waste - wrap your Christmas pudding in two layers of either plastic wrap or foil and you can freeze for up to a year.

Other items that are suitable for freezing includes:

Yoghurt

Cheese

Milk

Eggs including boiled eggs

Avocado

Nuts and seeds

Tomatoes

Wine

Bread

If you’re not sure if something can be frozen check out the Love Food Hate Waste site  which has a handy A-Z list of food items and if you can freeze them. When freezing your leftovers it’s recommended that you portion them out first so that you can easily defrost just what you need rather than defrosting everything and then having to throw away what you haven’t managed to use.

AMD plans to buy around $2.1 billion of silicon wafers from GlobalFoundries from 2022 through 2025.

Chipmaker GlobalFoundries was spun off from AMD in 2009 and soon expanded with the acquisition of Chartered Semiconductor and most of IBM's fab business in 2015 (with the latter deal part of an ongoing lawsuit).

In 2018 GlobalFoundries said that it would cut back on less profitable fabs and abandon cutting-edge and prohibitively expensive 7nm and 10nm chips.

This has proved successful for the company with its larger node chips proving popular and profitable in the mobile IoT defense and automotive sectors.

AMD uses the chipmaker for early-generation Ryzen products and the I/O dies for AMD’s current-generation Ryzen and Epyc CPUs.

For below 12nm products AMD uses rival foundry Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.

However with the ongoing chip shortage limiting foundry supply AMD may be looking elsewhere.

For the upcoming TSMC process node Apple is thought to have secured a large chunk of TSMC's supply and receives special treatment.

In November Taiwanese tech publication Digitimes claimed that this has led to AMD now considering turning to Samsung for 3nm chip manufacturing.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9iZXRoZW5ueS1mcmFua2VsLXNob3dzLWhlci1uby0xNDI4MzAxOTUuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bethenny Frankel Shows Her 'No Botox Wrinkled Forehead' and Says She Hasn't Had 'Any Surgery',"bethenny frankel / instagram

Bethenny Frankel's been honest about getting a little Botox before. But now she's decided to embrace aging the natural way.

The Real Housewives of New York City alum 51 shared some candid barefaced selfies on Instagram to give a close-up view at her unretouched fine lines that she hasn't smoothed out with cosmetic surgery or Botox.

""When we need a wake up no makeup selfie …. #nofilter. I'll post these for you periodically to remind you that no makeup and natural is as real as we can be"" Frankel said.

""I haven't seen any surgery or products that can compete with a good night's sleep"" the Skinnygirl mogul added.

Though Frankel said she may decide to get plastic surgery one day (and will consult her fans first!) right now she's happy with how she looks. ""There may come a day that I'll ask you if it's time to get some work done but for today I'm happy just the way I am. #thisisme"" the star said. ""PS. For the haters I gave you a no Botox wrinkled forehead pic as well …. just to avoid any confusion.""

Fans praised Frankel in the comment section for her honesty. ""You inspire me to age gracefully. I've watched you since a young age. Thank you for setting the example! 👏"" one person said. Someone else wrote: ""You are a natural beauty. Thanks for being real. ❤️""

Frankel's friend and former RHONY castmate Sonja Morgan said ""You [are] beautiful 😍.""

Frankel has often used her social media platform to encourage body positivity among women of all ages.

""If I were a 'filterer' I would have gotten rid of my lines and my dark circles but this is me at 50. #zeroglam #zerofilter"" she captioned a mirror selfie as she posed in Skinnygirl shapewear.

""Why do I mention this all the time? Because I think it's important for young women to know that being flawed is truthful and real and that filtering yourself into someone fictitious is actually damaging to girls' and women's self esteem"" Frankel continued. ""It's courageous and beautiful to be real at any age.""

Frankel has also previously noted that she isn't opposed to trying some cosmetic procedures when the time is right.

""I've had a breast lift. Filler is scary but I believe in Botox because it decreased the size of my jaw. I grind my teeth so it relaxes the muscle"" she told PEOPLE in April 2021.

She added: ""I don't use it as often as I should. I should set a calendar to look in the mirror. If I look like a Shar-Pei that's when I know I need it next.""",,,,,,,,,

He was born in 1940 in Philadelphia to Willard Detweiler Moyer Sr and Augusta Moyer (McAlevy). He was one of seven children preceded in death by his brother John and sisters Martha Glackin Beverly Bartholomew and Barbara Moyer.

Bill was an Air Force veteran and graduate of Pennsylvania State University where he met his wife Susan with whom he shared 57 years of marriage. He was employed by Air Products & Chemicals Inc for over 30 years and spent much of that time working internationally. Bill and Sue lived in Lancaster Ohio and Johannesburg South Africa before finally residing locally. Although he loved to see the world he always felt most at home when his feet were planted on Pennsylvania soil. After retiring from Air Products Bill was a partner in RMW Solutions. He was interested in history and proud to be a descendant of General William McAlevy who served in the Revolutionary War.

Bill was stoic honest and devoted to his family. Although he spent much of his time dedicated to his work he enjoyed relaxing outdoors and looking after the family menagerie of animals. Life is full of hardships but Bill proved to everyone that laughter is truly the best medicine - and there’s nothing that can’t be improved with a slice of chocolate cake and a scalding cup of coffee. He had a dry quick sense of humor that applied to any situation and was happy to share it with his family and friends.

Bill is survived by: his wife Susan his daughter Jennifer granddaughter Natalie great-granddaughter Lilith sisters Margaret wife of Charles Weisel of Coopersburg and Nancy wife of Donald Bowman of Mifflinburg brother-in-law John Buttery of Allentown many nieces and nephews and cats Sassy and Sweetiepie.

How To Do So Is Still Up in the Air,"Governments are taking steps to rein in plastic waste.

But none of what’s been done so far has been up to the challenge of a growing plastics industry fed by consumer demand for more plastic products resulting in a deepening global plastic waste crisis.

As a result there is now an intensifying focus on the possibility of a global treaty to control plastic pollution.

The next milestone in a diplomatic process that began in 2014 could come in February in Nairobi Kenya when the U.N. Environmental Assembly meets to decide if it will endorse the beginning of official negotiations over a plastics treaty.

Those efforts may have received a boost in late November when Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced the Biden administration would join the talks. Blinken reversing a position from the Trump administration said the U.S. goal is to “create a tool that we can use to protect our oceans and all of the life that they sustain from growing global harms of plastic pollution.”

The chemical industry and environmental groups alike have welcomed U.S. engagement in formal treaty talks with environmental groups like Greenpeace citing the need for global solutions to a global problem and the chemical industry expressing hope that a treaty could help advance its vision of eliminating plastic waste. Separately the industry has opposed suggestions that there be a cap placed on plastic production.

In backing the treaty process Erin Simon head of plastic waste and business for World Wildlife Fund a conservation group that operates in 100 countries cited a 2020 Pew Charitable Trusts report that said without “immediate ambitious and concerted actions” the world by 2040 would see the annual flow of plastic into the ocean triple to about 29 million metric tons per year the equivalent of 2500 single-use plastic bottles for every meter of ocean beach.

“That would continue to obviously create huge impacts on species through entanglement ingestion and just messing up the ecosystems” Simon said. “It would continue to create issues for coastal communities and local fisheries” placing a significant toll on “public health and vulnerable communities in general who are already disproportionately impacted.”

Devil in the Details

Cities states and entire countries have banned single use plastics like grocery bags and straws. Some 187 nations though not the United States have agreed to restrict international trade in plastic scrap and waste. And Congress in November authorized $350 million for recycling and management of plastic waste including the first funding for the 2020 Save Our Seas 2.0 Act to boost research international cooperation ocean cleanup and waste management.

With a treaty the devil will be in the details and the hard work of getting enough countries to agree on the scope and provisions. Observers say the process could take years.

Conceptually the countries supporting a new plastic treaty seem to be dividing into two schools of thought said Björn Beeler the international coordinator for the International Pollutants Elimination Network (IPEN) comprised of more than 600 public interest nongovernmental organizations in 128 countries working to eliminate toxic pollutants.

One school of thought focuses on a “lifecycle” approach that would take into account the impacts of plastics from production to their use and disposal or recycling. It’s led by Rwanda and Peru with support from the European Union and could limit virgin plastic production and control the use of toxic chemicals that are added into plastic products Beeler said.

The other takes a “waste management” approach and would focus more narrowly on strategies to control plastic waste. This orientation has been defined under a draft resolution from Japan he said.

Environmentalists are pushing for restrictions on single use plastics like bags cutlery and straws making plastic producers responsible for plastic waste and enforceable national limits on the flow of plastics into the ocean.

Representatives of the pollutants elimination network said that to be effective any treaty also needs to ban toxic chemical additives in plastics. On Dec. 14 IPEN and another environmental organization seeking to fight plastics pollution International Pellet Watch released two reports that detailed the presence of chemicals found in plastic pellets spilled on beaches and recycled plastic pellets purchased from recycling facilities globally. The groups are working with partner organizations in 35 countries.

Health effects associated with the chemicals include cancer and hormonal effects that can lead to reproductive growth and cognitive impairment according to the reports.

“When you add chemicals to plastics they are not strongly attached” said Sara Brosché an IPEN science advisor and lead author of one of the reports. “So they can leach out. They will slowly move into the household dust” she said. When children put toys in their mouths she added “these chemicals can move out of plastic material” and dissolve in their saliva.

‘Bound up in the Health of Our Oceans’

It’s unclear what specifically the Biden administration wants out of a plastics treaty. But in making his announcement in November Blinken said countries will need to “develop and enforce strong national action plans to address this problem at its source. We recognize that different actors will have different capacities to act but every nation every community and indeed every individual has a role to play.”

He also said “the private sector in particular will need to do more.”

Human health and survival is “bound up in the health of our oceans” Blinken said adding that plastic is sickening and killing ocean animals. “And because plastics absorb toxins when we eat seafood we’re not only consuming microplastics but toxins as well” he said.

IPEN however is concerned that the United States one of the leading plastic producing nations in the world will side with an industry that emphasizes waste management and so-called “advanced” or “chemical” recycling. A National Academies of Sciences Engineering and Medicine report in November concluded that so far chemical or advanced recycling is limited to energy intensive processes used to make fuel or other chemical products rather than new plastics.

“If a treaty promotes waste management and subsidizes chemical recycling which is basically plastic fuels waste-to-energy or building up waste management facilities then you begin to subsidize with public funds the responsibility of the private sector that’s making this product” Beeler said.

Industry’s Nod

In the United States the plastics and chemical industries have fought state local and Congressional efforts to ban plastics or cap plastic production. But the American Chemistry Council a major lobbying arm of the chemical industry and one that Beeler described as a “powerful actor in this whole conversation” has given a nod to Blinken’s announcement that the United States would back efforts to work on a global treaty.

“We are supportive of a global agreement among nations that will accelerate a transition to a more circular economy by expanding systems and infrastructure to collect and repurpose plastic resources” said Joshua Baca the American Chemistry Council’s vice president of plastics in a written statement.

Baca said U.S. plastic makers the International Council of Chemical Associations and the World Plastics Council support a treaty framework with principles that include having all nations agree to eliminating plastic waste while providing flexibility to meet the needs of individual nations. They also want widespread access to waste collection along with “recognizing the role plastics play in a lower-carbon future.”

The industry argues that plastics actually reduce emissions blamed for causing global warming for example by making products lighter and easier to transport and because plastic packaging better keeps food fresh longer reducing food waste and methane emissions. For a more sustainable future the Plastics Industry Association says “we need more plastic not less”

The industry’s position on plastics and global warming however runs counter to recent studies that show plastics production and disposal from production to disposal are adding to global greenhouse gas emissions and will only get worse.

The Center for International Environmental Law working with the Environmental Integrity Project FracTracker Alliance and others in 2019 concluded that the plastics’ and petrochemical industries’ worldwide growth plans could make it impossible to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius the most challenging benchmark established under the 2015 Paris climate agreement.

The industry’s lifecycle emissions from natural gas extraction to plastics production and disposal was projected to rise to 1.34 billion metric tons per year by 2030 equivalent to the emissions from nearly 300 coal-fired power plants sized at 500-megawatts each the study found.

In October the group Beyond Plastics led by former regional EPA administrator Judith Enck published “The New Coal Plastics and Climate Change” which found that as coal plants close and petrochemical infrastructure expands in the United States the plastics industry’s contribution to climate change will exceed that of coal by 2030.

When the diplomats get together in February those from the United States may also find backing for strong action in the National Academies report which concluded that the United States the largest producer of plastic waste needs a comprehensive strategy by the end of 2022 to curb its devastating impacts on ocean health and marine wildlife. It offered several overarching recommendations including a national cap on the production of virgin plastic.

A Call for the Treaty

A mix of businesses some of which have been under withering pressure because of their use of single-use plastic packaging or bottles are joining the call for a treaty.

The World Wildlife Fund with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation and Boston Consulting Group in 2020 published a “Business Case for a UN Treaty on Plastic Pollution.” The report observed that “many companies are facing increased reputational risks” from their use of plastics threatening their customer bases as well as their ability to attract employees. The report also noted that it was “no longer a question of whether regulation is coming but what regulation is coming.”

Regulations already on the books vary so much from jurisdiction to jurisdiction—including bans against plastic bans—that it has become “increasingly difficult for businesses to navigate the maze of heterogeneous regulations at global national and even subnational levels” according to the report.

The three organizations have a “manifesto” now backed by dozens of businesses acknowledging that plastic “plays an important role in our lives and brings many benefits” but that “mounting evidence shows this problem will continue to grow unless we fundamentally rethink the way we produce use reuse and dispose of plastic.” So far about 90 companies have signed on including financial institutions producers retailers and brand owners such as Fidelity International Sodexo Coca Cola and Procter & Gamble.

There has also been a series of summits this year about a plastics treaty between activists and industry representatives organized by The Ocean Plastics Leadership Network a 90-member group assisted by World Wildlife Fund and Greenpeace that is working “not to achieve consensus but understanding and hopefully new ideas and collaborations” according to its website.

While a treaty could be years away Simon with the World Wildlife Fund said she expects there could be progress along the way in part because the process will further reveal the problems with plastic waste and potential solutions.

Because urgent action is needed she said “I’m going to be less caught up in how long it’s going to take and more about if the right topics are being discussed to signal the actions I need to see.”

Chemicals in artificial Christmas trees may pose health and environmental risks.

Font Size: A A A

Opting for an artificial Christmas tree this year?

Chances are the answer is “yes.” Over 80 percent of U.S. households that put up a Christmas tree will choose an artificial tree over the natural pine-needle alternative.

Many consumers cite safety as a major reason for going the artificial route. Real Christmas trees catch fire at approximately three times the rate of artificial trees while most artificial Christmas trees are made of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) a widely used fire-retardant chemical.

Artificial Christmas trees also are known for their soft-to-the-touch pine needles. This kid-friendly texture comes from the high number of phthalates mixed in with PVC during the manufacturing process. Phthalates are a broad class of chemicals that give PVC its plasticity.

Despite the promise of reduced fire risk and a softer touch some consumer and environmental rights advocates insist that artificial Christmas trees are not a truly safe risk-proof option. They warn that artificial Christmas trees pose health risks for consumers because of the chemicals added to PVC during production.

So far U.S. regulators do not yet agree.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has recognized that “high exposure” to phthalates may raise health concerns. In recent years some researchers have begun to link high degrees of phthalate exposure to lowered fertility certain cancers and testosterone reduction.

In 2017 with these risks in mind the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission banned many phthalates from use in manufacturing toys for small children. China—where approximately 80 percent of U.S. artificial Christmas trees are imported from—has imposed similar restrictions.

Some epidemiologists are calling for phthalate bans across all consumer products. But for now phthalate regulations only reach the toys under the tree not the tree itself.

In addition to concerns about phthalates in artificial Christmas trees some consumer advocates allege that these trees’ production and disposal increase global pollution. For example artificial trees tend to last only ten years on average. Since PVC is not recyclable disposed trees either waste away in landfills or are incinerated. Environmental experts note that carcinogenic dioxins are emitted into the air when products with PVC are burned.

Dioxins released into the air through incineration as well as in the production of artificial trees pose substantial health risks for workers and residents in surrounding communities. And experts note that low-income residents and communities of color tend to bear the brunt of health risks associated with PVC emissions as these groups are disproportionately more likely to live near both PVC factories and incinerators.

In 2012 EPA issued a rule mandating emission caps for U.S. factories producing PVC. The rule aimed to reduce hazardous waste pollutants—including dioxins—by over 260 tons per year. Since then environmental advocates have continued to push for more comprehensive regulation. In December 2020 environmentalists won a partial victory. EPA issued a proposed rule that would decrease hazardous air pollutants by an additional 34 tons per year.

These EPA rules would limit the release of dioxins during the production of the small proportion of artificial trees manufactured in the United States but much less agency attention has been paid to emissions released during artificial tree disposal. In May 2021 the Center for Biological Diversity sued EPA under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act requesting that the agency classify discarded PVC as hazardous waste and regulate it accordingly.

No such regulations have yet been issued.

In addition to dioxin pollution some consumer groups argue that artificial Christmas trees present risks of lead exposure—but the validity of these claims remains uncertain.

Lead exposure even in small amounts threatens health. But the U.S. Food and Drug Administration notes that “most intentional uses of lead are now banned in the United States.” Since 1976 lead use in paint dust soil air and water has been regulated by the Toxic Substances Control Act.

Notably federal lead regulations do not extend to plastics. And similar to phthalates additives small amounts of lead have historically been added to PVC during production.

The American Christmas Tree Association a non-profit dedicated to providing the public with information on Christmas tree purchasing options has reportedly said that “leaded PVC is no longer used at all in its members’ products.” The National Tree Company a tree importer and wholesaler agrees that lead exposure should not worry potential buyers. Yet in California Proposition 65 still requires warning labels on imported artificial Christmas trees.

Over the last thirty years consumer exposure to lead has significantly declined. But it remains unclear whether existing regulatory controls are truly enough to curb all lead additives in plastics.

Despite these safety considerations the sale of artificial Christmas trees continues this December. Although these trees will bring much joy this holiday season some advocates suggest that they may be worthy of greater regulation for Christmases to come.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vYXNpYS5uaWtrZWkuY29tL0J1c2luZXNzL01hcmtldHMvQ29tbW9kaXRpZXMvSW5kb25lc2lhbi1jb2FsLW1pbmVyLUFkYXJvLXRvLWJ1aWxkLTcyOG0tYWx1bWludW0tc21lbHRlctIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Indonesian coal miner Adaro to build $728m aluminum smelter,"JAKARTA -- Major Indonesian coal miner Adaro Energy on Thursday announced a plan to invest $728 million to build an aluminum smelter and a separate initiative to develop a ""new energy battery factory"" in the company's first major moves to diversify away from coal.

Under the bill local governments would be prohibited from creating rules that bar renting a residential dwelling to a short-term guest rentals advertised on popular sites such as Airbnb and Vrbo.

The bill was pre-filed in November for possible consideration in the upcoming legislative session and sponsored by Rep. Lee Hewitt R-Murrells Inlet; Rep. Melissa Oremus R-Aiken; and Lin Bennett R-Charleston.

Local governments that violate the rules would be unable to collect property tax at the higher 6 percent commercial rate for short-term rental properties and ineligible to receive money from the state's Local Government Fund and other state aid.

Property owners kept from operating a short-term rental would only be subject to the 4 percent property tax rate for a primary residence even if the property was used as a second home or long-term rental Hewitt said.

""You've taken away some property rights from that person then they need to be compensated and need to be treated just as the other properties are"" Hewitt said.

While more cities have considered and adopted regulations for short-term rentals none in South Carolina are known to have outright banned the practice said Scott Slatton director of advocacy and communications for the Municipal Association of South Carolina. The nonprofit organization that lobbies lawmakers on behalf of the state's cities and towns doesn't oppose the bill as written Slatton said. That could change if the bill were rewritten to prevent regulating the rentals Slatton noted.

""This is just one of many many bills that seek to preempt local authority and on principle those are things that we generally we're going to oppose because local officials know best how to address issues in their communities"" Slatton said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5ZG90LmNvbS9pcmwvYWlyYm5iLWRhbWFnZXMtZnJpZW5kLXVzZXMtbmFtZS10by1ib29rLXRpa3Rvay_SAVBodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseWRvdC5jb20vaXJsL2FpcmJuYi1kYW1hZ2VzLWZyaWVuZC11c2VzLW5hbWUtdG8tYm9vay10aWt0b2svP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Your host is requesting $6864 in damages’: TikToker gets ‘insane’ Airbnb bill after her ‘friend’ uses her name to book,"A viral TikToker says she was charged what viewers are describing as an “insane” fee for damages after booking an Airbnb for her friend. After this her friend might not be her friend anymore.

User @egooorls69 shared a screenshot of the extra bill which totaled a whopping $6864 “for damages potentially caused during your stay.”

The TikTok garnered about 1.4 million views and nearly 50000 likes as of Friday. Viewers were just as shocked as the TikTok creator.

“This is why I don’t help anyone” one viewer commented on the video.

“This is why I will never do it again lol” the creator responded to the comment.

Unrecorded

One viewer said the TikTok creator should make her so-called friend pay the damages: “Girl if you don’t make them pay for it.”

But according to the creator the friend might be in jail now.

Several viewers questioned what the friend could have possibly done to rack up nearly $7000 in damage fees so the creator shared a series of pictures sent to her by the Airbnb owner.

Apparently the friend staying in the Airbnb threw one of the couch cushions into the fire leaving a large burnt hole in the corner of it. They also got ash everywhere and let their dog do its business anywhere. On top of that they signed the TikTok creator’s name on the guest list.

“Yeah so it’s pretty good times” the TikToker said dryly.

On the small bright side the Airbnb owner was “very kind” about the whole thing the TikToker said.

“She kinda understood that I rented it for someone else and I hadn’t done it” she said. “But still super shitty situation.”

Based on the pictures the TikToker shared viewers didn’t understand how the damages could realistically total $6864.

“That’s not 7k worth damage maybe 1k” one viewer commented.

Another user said “Baby that couch is from 1985 it’s worth $75.”

But a few viewers pointed out that even if the actual damage wouldn’t cost that much to replace the Airbnb owner still had to make up for the lost revenue while they fix or replace the damaged items.

“Damage fees may be higher bc she’s going to lose bookings while it has to be fixed” one person wrote.

Regardless other TikTok viewers insisted that the damage fees were still too high adding that that’s why landlords get insurance.

“Girl this is why the host has an insurance policy. I work in insurance and we write for Airbnb rentals all the time. Fight this” one commented.

Neither TikTok user @egooorls69 nor Airbnb responded to the Daily Dot’s request for comment.

The publication Confused.com recently came out with a roll call of the wackiest and weirdest listings on the site as rounded up by the New York Post. The collection spans the United States and beyond and emphasizes one-of-a-kind offerings.

“There’s a lot more interest from holidaymakers in finding a unique stay” Confused.com’s Jessica Willock told the Post.

Topping the publication’s rankings is the Campera Hotel in Mexico also known as the Bubble Suite. Travelers can stay in the bubble-like shelters for $215 per night enjoying a semi-outdoor experience akin to glamping–each of the dozen bubbles has a private bathroom and full-sized bed.

The runner-up position belongs to the Dreamy Tropical Tree House in Hawaii. The treehouse has a 360-degree view of the surrounding tropical jungle and won’t break the bank at $300 per night. Unfortunately only the most thorough planners will be able to stay at the treehouse as there are no bookings available until January … 2023.

Another treehouse cracks the list as the most expensive property included. The Treehouse Blue Mountains in Australia can set guests back as much as $1685 per night (though bookings are currently going for half that). For the price guests will be surrounded by 600 acres of private wilderness including the Blue Mountains rainforest.

On the opposite end of the pricing spectrum is Cabana Floripa in Brazil. The unique listing has walls built from recycled bottles and guests can rest on repurposed furniture. The eco-friendly listing can be booked for as little as $21 per night.

As travelers try to escape from their own homes the rise of unique listings on Airbnb is only likely to grow.

“Weird is the word for holiday hunters in 2021 with demand increasing across many of the biggest countries” Confused.com wrote in its report. “After seeing the same four walls for much of 2020 it looks like people are keener than ever to say somewhere strange.”

(AP) — If you're planning to rent a home in central Florida over New Year's Eve you may be out of luck.

Airbnb says potential guests without a history of positive reviews will be unable to make one-night reservations in Orlando and Kissimmee over New Year's Eve in an effort to crack down on disruptive parties.

Some people also will be unable to make last-minute two-or-three-night reservations over the New Year's holiday in central Florida if they don't have any positive reviews as determined by the company's algorithms. Users with a history of positive reviews don't have to worry about those restrictions.

The New Year's Eve restrictions in central Florida are part of a larger worldwide effort by Airbnb to crack down on disruptive parties held at the short-term rental homes.

Last New Year's Eve was the first time the company tried the initiative. It blocked 1200 rentals in Orlando and 750 rentals in Kissimmee. Around the world 243000 rentals were blocked.

How does the operator know if the AI is wrong that it made a mistake that it didn’t behave as intended?

Answers to questions like that come from a technical discipline known as Responsible AI (RAI). It’s the subject of a report issued by the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) in mid-November called Responsible AI Guidelines in Practice which addresses a requirement in the FY21 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) to ensure that the DoD has “the ability requisite resourcing and sufficient expertise to ensure that any artificial intelligence technology…is ethically and reasonably developed.”

DIU’s RAI guidelines provide a framework for AI companies DOD stakeholders and program managers that can help to ensure that AI programs are built with the principles of fairness accountability and transparency at each step in the development cycle of an AI system according to Jared Dunnmon technical director of the artificial intelligence/machine learning portfolio at DIU.

This framework is designed to achieve four goals said Dunnmon:

Clarify end goals align expectations and acknowledge risks and tradeoffs in order to speed development;

Employ fairness accountability and transparency in the development testing and vetting of AI systems in order to avoid things like bias in facial recognition systems for example;

Improve evaluation selection prototyping and adoption in order to avoid potential bad outcomes; and

Foment constructive questions and conversations that can help imbue AI projects with better success.

Trust in the AI is foremost

Just like Isaac Asimov’s Three Laws of Robotics describes ethical behavior for robots the DIU’s guidelines offer five ethical principles for development and use of artificial intelligence.

Responsible : DoD personnel will exercise appropriate levels of judgment and care while remaining responsible for the development deployment and use of AI capabilities. That means that human beings maintain responsibility for the development and use of AI. Equitable : The DoD will take deliberate steps to minimize unintended bias in AI capabilities. That requires reducing bias through testing selection of adequate training sets and diverse engineering teams. Traceable : The Defense Department’s AI capabilities will be developed and deployed in such a manner that relevant personnel possess an understanding of the technology development processes and operational methods including transparent and auditable methodologies data sources and design procedure and documentation. Reliable : The DoD’s AI capabilities will have explicit well-defined mission use cases and the safety security and effectiveness of such capabilities will be subject to testing and assurance within those defined uses across their entire life cycles. Governable : DoD will design and engineer AI capabilities to fulfill their intended functions while possessing the ability to detect and avoid unintended consequences and have the ability to disengage or deactivate deployed systems that demonstrate unintended behavior.

It’s that fifth principle governable that addresses the questions asked at the top about letting the operator know when the AI is wrong. Operators need to establish trust in the AI systems or they simply won’t be used. That’s not an option for something as complex as the Joint All Domain Command and Control concept of operations.

“Governable AI systems allow for graceful termination and human intervention when algorithms do not behave as intended” said Dr. Amanda Muller Consulting AI Systems Engineer and Technical Fellow who is the Responsible AI Lead for Northrop Grumman which is one of the few companies with such a position. “At that point the human operator can either take over or make adjustments to the inputs to the algorithm or whatever needs to be done. But the human always maintains the ability to govern that AI algorithm.”

Northrop Grumman’s adoption of these RAI principles builds justified confidence in the AI systems being created because the human can understand and interpret what the AI is doing determine if it’s operating correctly through verification and validation and take actions if it is not.

The importance of doing so is clear for the future of AI in the military. If AI systems do not work as designed or are unpredictable “leaders will not adopt them operators will not use them Congress will not fund them and the American people will not support them” states the Final Report from the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence (NSCAI). This commission was a temporary independent federal entity created by Congress in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019. The commission was led by former Google CEO Eric Schmidt and former Deputy Secretary of Defense Robert Work and delivered its 756-page Final Report in March 2021 disbanding in October.

“The power of AI is its ability to learn and adapt to changing situations” said Muller. “The battlefield is a dynamic environment and the side that adapts fastest gains the advantage. Like with all systems though AI is vulnerable to attack and failure. To truly harness the power of AI technology developers must align with the ethical principles adopted by the DoD.”

The complexity of all-domain operations will demand AI

The DoD’s pledge to develop and implement only Responsible Artificial Intelligence will underpin development of systems for JADC2. An OODA (Observe Orient Decide Act) loop stretching from space to air and ground and to sea and cyber will only be possible through the ability of an AI system to control the JADC2 infrastructure.

“The AI could perceive and reason on the best ways to move information across different platforms nodes and decision makers” explained Vern Boyle Vice President of Advanced Processing Solutions for Northrop Grumman’s Networked Information Solutions division. “And it could optimize the movement of that information and the configuration of the network because it’ll be very complex.

“We’ll be operating in contested environments where it will be difficult for a human to react and understand how to keep the network and the comm links functioning. The use of AI to control the communication and networking infrastructure is going to be one big application area.”

At the same time RAI will serve as a counterweight to America’s Great Power competitors China and Russia who certainly won’t engage in ethical AI as they push for power. As part of its strategic plan China has declared it will be the global leader in AI by 2030 and its investments in dual-use technologies like advanced processing cyber security and AI are threats to U.S. technical and cognitive dominance.

“The key difference is that China is applying AI technologies broadly throughout the country” said Boyle. “They are using AI for surveillance and tracking their citizens students and visitors. They use AI to monitor online behaviors social interactions and biometrics.

“China has no concern about privacy rights or ethical application of the data that AI is able to gather and share. All data is collected and used by both industry and the Chinese government to advance their goal of global technical dominance by 2030.”

Fundamental to the U.S response to China’s actions is assuring that the Defense Department’s use of AI reflects democratic values according to Boyle.

“It is critical that we move rapidly to set the global standard for responsible and ethical AI use and to stay ahead of China and Russia’s advances toward the lowest common denominator. The U.S. our ally partners and all democratic-minded nations must work together to lead the development of global standards around AI and talent development.”

Northrop Grumman systems to close the connectivity/networking gap

Doing so will help to close one of the most significant capability gaps facing armed forces right now which is basic connectivity and networking. The platforms and sensors needed to support JADC2—satellites unmanned air and ground systems and guided missile destroyers to name a few—aren’t necessarily able to connect and move information effectively because of legacy communications and networking systems.

That reality will dampen the DoD’s ambitions for AI and machine learning for tactical operations.

“It’s both a gap and a challenge” observed Boyle. “Let’s assume though that everyone’s connected. Now there’s an information problem. Not everybody shares their information. It’s not described in a standard way. Having the ability to understand and reason on information presumes that you’re able to understand it. Those capabilities aren’t necessarily mature yet either.”

There are also challenges with respect to multi-level security and the ability to share and distribute information at different classification levels. That adds a level of complexity that’s not typically present in the commercial sector.

The severity of this issue and the need to solve it in the name of all-domain operations is driving Northrop Grumman to prioritize the successful application of AI to communications and networking.

The company has numerous capabilities deployed now on important platforms such as Global Hawk and is working with customers to leverage gateway systems in service now for data relay while developing new capabilities to address gaps in communications and networking.

Northrop Grumman’s portfolio already contains enabling technologies needed to connect joint forces including advanced networking AI/ML space command and control systems autonomous systems powered by collaborative autonomy and advanced resiliency features needed to protect against emerging threats. And it is developing AI that acts as the connective tissue for military platforms sensors and systems to communicate with one another—enabling them to pass information and data using secure open systems similar to how we use the Internet and 5G in our day-to-day lives.

“The DoD has stated that it must have an AI-enabled force by 2025 because speed will be the differentiator in future battles” said Boyle “That means speed to understand the battle space; speed to determine the best course of action to take in a very complex and dynamic battle space; and speed to be able to take appropriate actions. Together they will let the DoD more quickly execute the OODA Loop (Observe Orient Decide Act).

“AI and advanced specialized processing at the tactical edge will provide a strategic information advantage. AI and edge computing are the core enabling technologies for JADC2.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN1bi5jby51ay90ZWNoL3NjaWVuY2UvMTcxMzU1ODYvbmV3c3ByZXNzX3F1ZXVlZF9yZXZpc2lvbl9jaHJpc3RtYXMtY29uanVuY3Rpb24tc2l4LXBsYW5ldHMtbmlnaHQtc2t5XzAv0gF7aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlc3VuLmNvLnVrL3RlY2gvc2NpZW5jZS8xNzEzNTU4Ni9uZXdzcHJlc3NfcXVldWVkX3JldmlzaW9uX2NocmlzdG1hcy1jb25qdW5jdGlvbi1zaXgtcGxhbmV0cy1uaWdodC1za3lfMC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Christmas conjunction – How to see SIX planets align in the night sky in rare celestial event...,"WORLDS ALIGNED Christmas conjunction – How to see SIX planets align in the night sky in rare celestial event

STARGAZERS are in for a festive treat this holiday season as six planets light up the night sky at once over the UK.

Jupiter Saturn and Venus are visible throughout December and they'll be joined by Mercury Neptune and Uranus next week.

2 Six planets will appear in the night sky in one evening over the Christmas period

The best time to see all six in one evening will be from December 28 to January 3 roughly half an hour after sunset.

According to the BBC's Sky at Night Magazine the planetary parade offers a ""great astronomical event"" for both amateur and seasoned astronomers.

That's because the celestial light show will be visible through binoculars or a small telescope with many of the planets viewable with the naked eye.

""This will be a great astronomical event for beginners for young astronomers and children"" the magazine said.

""Because these events happen close to sunset it’s worth remembering to wait until the Sun has completely set before observing.

""Catching the Sun with the naked eye or through binoculars or a telescope could seriously damage your eyesight.""

To view the alignment yourself head outside 30 minutes after sunset – around 4:30 p.m. UK time or 5:00 p.m. ET – and look southwest.

Venus Saturn and Jupiter will be lined up in the twilight sky just north of the Sagittarius and south of the Aquarius constellations.

Venus will be the brightest lowest planet with Jupiter the second brightest but highest. Saturn in the middle will be a little darker.

On December 28 an additional trio of planets will make their appearance.

Mercury will lie close to Venus above a flat southwest horizon around 40 minutes after sunset.

You'll need a low flat horizon and likely a pair of binoculars to see it. Make sure you wait until the Sun has fully set to avoid damaging your eyes.

Neptune and Uranus will appear a little later once true darkness has set at around 6:00 p.m. UK time.

To spot them look south of the Aries constellation and north of Sagittarius.

If you're having trouble spotting them you can always use a smartphone app to locate constellations and planets in the night sky.

Top stargazing apps for Android and iPhone include SkyView Lite Star Tracker and Star Walk 2.

Make sure you give your eyes a break from your phone afterwards though as stargazing is best when your eyes have adjusted to the dark.

As of this month the Verbio North America plant in Nevada Iowa has been converting chopped cornstalks into natural gas that enters an Alliant Energy pipeline that traverses central Iowa.

Using anaerobic digestion eight large digesters combine the corn stover with the bacteria of livestock manure which results in the conversion of corn residue into biomethane gas that is equivalent to the natural gas found in fossil fuels.

The plant known as Verbio Nevada Biorefinery is in its beginning stages with plans to expand in the coming months with a goal of providing enough renewable natural gas or RNG to heat 5000 homes. Eight additional digesters are being built with plans to build an additional eight as the company begins to produce corn-based ethanol.

""Stover is basically above-ground plant material of the crop other than the grain"" Kapil Arora field agricultural engineer with Iowa State University Extension and Outreach says. ""It can be chopped into different sizes depending on the needs of the plant and it can easily be made into bales.""

Iowa is the nation's leader in corn production – with over 13 million acres and over 2 billion bushels harvested annually. After the corn is harvested the stover is what's left behind to decompose on the ground.

Also called corn fodder or crop residue the stover is nutrient rich but also poses a challenge for farmers when they go to plant the following year's crop.

""Farmers here in Iowa as the yields have gone up are faced with additional stover left on the field and many do additional tillage just to get that stover to decompose and degrade"" Arora says. ""There has been a need to do something with that stover for many many years.""

Arora and ISU Extension and Outreach have been involved with Verbio from the start providing technical support hosting farmer meetings and conducting research.

The Process

After the corn is harvested Verbio employees condense the stover on contracted fields into large square bales that are easy to move and stack. Verbio typically removes about 50% of the corn stover which reduces the need for tillage and allows some farmers to pursue no-till planting by reducing the amount of residue left on the surface.

Farmers are paid $8 per bale and the equipment and labor are supplied by Verbio. The company contracted about 6000 acres this year and hopes to expand to 30000 acres in 2022.

The end result is a renewable source of energy with multiple environmental benefits.

""We're taking the carbon degradation that would go up into the atmosphere we're capturing that we're scrubbing it and we're allowing you to heat your home with it locally"" Ron DeJongh president of Verbio Agriculture says.

The bales go through a hammer mill and are chopped to less than ¼-inch size to create the most surface area possible before being fed into digesters that are full of manure and bacteria that decompose the stover and create biomethane gas.

Gas coming off the digesters is scrubbed and concentrated to almost 99.9% biomethane before being pressurized and pushed into an Alliant Energy pipeline in front of the plant. The plant plans to eventually become energy sufficient burning its own gas to run various plant operations.

The process is fairly simple. But perfecting it and making it economical has taken time.

Background

Verbio bought the plant from DuPont about two years ago. Original plans were to produce ethanol from the stover but those plans did not come to fruition.

The new owners hope to continue the progress that was made and have plans to decommission the stacks of old bales of corn stover left behind by the previous owner.

Working with ISU Extension and Outreach Verbio is improving its process and plans for growth.

According to Arora who has studied corn stover for many years Iowa has the potential to support additional corn-stover plants across the state. He predicts more plants will be built across the Midwest as well.

""Traditionally we have taken energy from fossil fuels which are buried deep in the soil underneath the earth's crust. But this methodology basically takes carbon on the surface of the earth and cycles it into a fuel and eventually we will be going down this path more and more"" Arora says.

Looking Ahead

Arora is helping the company study logistics and engage with Iowa farmers and the public. Farmer meetings were held during the summer of 2021 and more will likely be held next year.

He also sees opportunities for student researchers who may complete field research related to corn stover or possibly work for Verbio as an intern or employee.

""There's a big long-term relationship getting started here and I envision that as they grow into this space we will continue to have a significant role to play with Verbio"" Arora says.

When fully operational the Nevada plant plans to process about 100000 tons of corn stover a year.

In addition to natural gas – the primary product – the process yields a nutrient-rich by-product called humus which serves as a soil amendment and organic fertilizer.",,,,,,,,,,,,

As No. 8 Ole Miss prepares to take on No. 7 Baylor in the Allstate Sugar Bowl The Grove Report examined the Rebels' bowl game history on Thursday.

Now it takes a look at Ole Miss' New Year's Six bowl appearances since the turn of the century. The Rebels will appear in their sixth New Year's Six bowl since the 2004 Cotton Bowl on Jan. 1.

2004 SBC Cotton Bowl Classic

No. 21 Oklahoma State vs. No. 16 Ole Miss

Final Score: Ole Miss 31 Oklahoma State 28

In what was Eli Manning's last hurrah in an Ole Miss uniform he led the Rebels to their first access bowl win since the 1971 Peach Bowl. Counting the win in the Cotton Bowl the 2003 season saw Ole Miss finish with an overall record of 10-3. Manning went 22-for-31 through the air for 259 yards two touchdowns and an interception in the game.

2009 AT&T Cotton Bowl Classic

No. 25 Ole Miss vs. No. 7 Texas Tech

Final Score: Ole Miss 47 Texas Tech 34

Ole Miss' first bowl berth since Eli Manning's senior year in Oxford was also in the Cotton Bowl Classic and this was the last installment of the game to be played in the self-named Cotton Bowl stadium in Dallas Texas.

This version of the Cotton Bowl featured the dueling of quarterbacks Jevan Snead (MISS) and Graham Harrell (TTU). Snead threw for 292 yards and three touchdowns in the win and Harrell tossed four scores behind 364 yards. This Texas Tech team was coached by Mike Leach current head coach at Mississippi State.

2010 AT&T Cotton Bowl Classic

No. 19 Oklahoma State vs. Ole Miss

Final Score: Ole Miss 21 Oklahoma State 7

Ole Miss also played in the first Cotton Bowl Classic to be played in its current location of Cowboys Stadium (now known as AT&T Stadium) in Arlington. This relatively-low-scoring affair was dominated by Dexter McCluster of Ole Miss who ran for 184 yards and two touchdowns in the win. Jevan Snead threw three interceptions in the game but Oklahoma State quarterback Zac Robinson threw four.

2014 Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl

No. 9 Ole Miss vs. No. 6 TCU

Final Score: TCU 42 Ole Miss 3

Ole Miss met with a TCU team that had recently been snubbed from the College Football Playoff in 2014 and that motivation from the Horned Frogs showed in Atlanta.

The 2014 season was up-and-down for the Rebels as the team knocked off Alabama at home and found themselves in the inaugural installment of the College Football Playoff Rankings but losses to Auburn LSU and Arkansas killed any hopes of Ole Miss competing for an SEC title. An Ole Miss win in the Egg Bowl kept Mississippi State out of the College Football Playoff but the Rebels were unable to secure a bowl win in the season.

2016 Allstate Sugar Bowl

No. 16 Oklahoma State vs. No. 12 Ole Miss

Final Score: Ole Miss 48 Oklahoma State 20

In what was the pinnacle of the Hugh Freeze era in Oxford Ole Miss took home a win in the Sugar Bowl following the 2015 regular season. The Rebels finished this season 10-3 after its win over Oklahoma State and Ole Miss quarterback Chad Kelly threw for 302 yards on 21 completions and four touchdowns. Kelly was also the leading rusher for the Rebels with 73 yards. Eight different Rebel receivers caught a pass in the win.

This was Ole Miss' first appearance in the Sugar Bowl since the 1969 season.

Ole Miss will return to the Sugar Bowl on Jan. 1 when it takes on Baylor. Kickoff between the Rebels and the Bears is set for 7:45 p.m. on ESPN.

Welcome to our WrestlingINC.com Live WWE SmackDown Viewing Party. Tonight's show comes from the Allstate Arena near Chicago IL.

- The Christmas Eve edition of WWE SmackDown on FOX opens up with a look back at how WWE Universal Champion Roman Reigns fired Paul Heyman last week and was then attacked by Brock Lesnar.

- A somewhat disheveled Paul Heyman is backstage with Kayla Braxton now in an interview that is billed as recorded earlier today. Kayla says it's been one week since Heyman was fired publicly by WWE Universal Champion Roman Reigns She asks him what happened.

Heyman says what happened was he told the truth to Reigns a truth Reigns didn't want to hear publicly. He was fired publicly because he told the truth. Smashed in the face publicly. Heyman goes on and says he paid a price for telling the truth. Kayla asks if he regrets telling the truth. Heyman thinks about it and says no because his role as special counsel was to tell Reigns these uncomfortable truths to not just protect Reigns as a personality or IP but as champion.

Heyman says when he came back from the ring he had to explain this to Reigns but all his suits bags and belongings were tossed from Reigns' locker room suite into the hallway like he's some rookie. Heyman says his role was to protect the title and make no mistake about it Reigns is the greatest Universal Champion of all-time but he needs to be protected from Brock Lesnar.

Kayla asks Heyman what's next. He takes a sip of water and says he doesn't know. What does he do now? Go to WWE NXT scout a top talent and start all over again? Not at this stage. He put every bit of his heart soul and spirit into being Reigns' special counsel because he believes in Reigns and without that maybe it's time for Heyman to acknowledge that his career is most likely over.

Moscow has increased pressure on Big Tech this year in a campaign that critics characterise as an attempt by the Russian authorities to exert tighter control over the internet something they say threatens individual and corporate freedom.

Google said in an email it would study the court ruling on Friday before deciding on further steps.

Later on Friday the court fined Meta Platforms $27.15m on the same grounds. Russia’s communication watchdog Roskomnadzor said that Facebook and Instagram failed to remove 2000 pieces that violate Russian laws whereas Google keeps 2600 pieces of banned content.

Meta Platforms did not immediately respond to request for comment.

Russia has imposed small fines on foreign technology companies throughout this year but Friday’s penalties mark the first time it has exacted a percentage of a company’s annual Russian turnover greatly increasing the sum of the fine.

It did not specify the percentage although calculations by the Reuters news agency show Google’s fine equates to just over 8 percent.

Russia has ordered companies to delete posts promoting drug abuse and dangerous pastimes information about homemade weapons and explosives as well as ones by groups it designates as extremist or “terrorist”.

Google which has paid more than $434560 in fines over content violations this year is at odds with Moscow on a number of issues.

Russia has demanded it restore access to state-backed broadcaster RT’s German-language channels.

Last week a sanctioned Russian businessman claimed victory over Google in a court case that could see the tech giant hit with another heavy fine.

Moscow has also demanded that 13 foreign and mostly US technology companies which include Google and Meta Platforms be set up on Russian soil by January 1 or face possible restrictions or outright bans.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmR3LmNvbS9lbi9ydXNzaWFuLWNvdXJ0LWZpbmVzLWdvb2dsZS1mYWNlYm9vay1vdmVyLWJhbm5lZC1jb250ZW50L2EtNjAyNTA1NTHSAVhodHRwczovL2FtcC5kdy5jb20vZW4vcnVzc2lhbi1jb3VydC1maW5lcy1nb29nbGUtZmFjZWJvb2stb3Zlci1iYW5uZWQtY29udGVudC9hLTYwMjUwNTUx?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Russia fines Google Facebook over banned content,"Moscow has accused Google and Facebook's parent company Meta of failing to remove illegal content from their platforms. It's the latest blow against tech giants in the Eastern European country.

A Moscow court on Friday ordered Google's Alphabet Inc. to pay a 7.2 billion ruble ($98 million/€87 million) fine for failing to remove content Russia deemed illegal.

The US company had previously been fined in Russia for the same reason but Friday's penalty is the biggest so far.

Russian news agency Interfax reported that the fine was calculated from a percentage of Google's annual earnings.

Google said it would study the Moscow court decision before taking any further action.

Later Friday Facebook parent company Meta received a 1.9 billion ruble ($27 million) court fine again for failing to remove banned content.

Twitter was also issued a fine of 3 million rubles ($40000) on Thursday for not removing banned content.

Russia cracking down on US tech giants

The rulings are the latest blow to US tech companies doing business in the region.

Moscow urged foreign tech giants in November to set up physical operations in Russia by the end of the year. The demand was aimed at not only Google but also Meta Twitter and TikTok.

Russia has warned these companies that additional restrictions or an outright ban would occur if they fail to comply with the order.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has previously railed against US big tech companies and their pervasive influence.

""These are not just economic giants in some areas they are de facto competing with states"" Putin said during the virtual Davos economic summit in January.

Google warned it could be blocked

Russia's State Duma deputy Alexander Khinshtein said in remarks quoted by Russian news agencies that the fine ""does not in any way interfere with the further work of Google.""

""But I must remind you that the legislation provides for other forms of response and so-called methods of coercion which include slowing down traffic and complete blocking in Russia'' he added.

Russia has demanded big tech platforms take down ""extremist"" content. Critics have said the Russian government is using extremism as a pretext to censor content critical of the Kremlin such as photos or information about anti-government protests.

The tech giant announced the news via its Chromium Bug tracker the codebase for Chrome and a solution to the issue is currently nowhere in sight.

It’s currently unclear what websites – and how many – are due to be affected by the problem.

Many of those that are will not likely know they’re affected until it’s already too late experts say.

Users of Chrome should brace themselves for disruption or find another browser to use until the issue is resolved a Forbes report said.

“Based on Google’s current release rate Chrome Canary users could be facing this decision as soon as next month while the billions of users running the browser’s stable version are looking at a 3-6 month countdown” the report forecasted.

NO SOLUTION IN SIGHT

According to the outlet the source of the issue comes down to version numbers of Chrome’s software.

The official version of Chrome is currently on version 96 while ‘Chrome Canary’ — the early access developer build — is already on version 99.

When the version reaches 100 websites affected by the glitch will apparently stop loading.

“The reason for this is these sites check the version of Chrome visiting the site but website design software like Duda only checks the first two digits” the report by Gordon Kelly reads.

So far there is no fix for the bug that could break websites worldwide. Getty

“The check is for security reasons to stop older unsupported versions of Chrome from visiting (version 40 and older is a common cut-off point) and Chrome 100 will be read as ‘Chrome 10’ and blocked.”

Google has been launching new versions of its Chrome software at a startling speed in recent months.

For instance Chrome 95 was only just released by the company in October.

GOOGLE UNDER FIRE

Google is reportedly experimenting with a hack to stem the effects of the glitch.

That hack reportedly involves altering how its version numbers are displayed to ensure “99” is displayed in the first two digits in the version 100 update.

It remains unclear whether the hack will be successful or how long it would take to implement if it was.

Chrome has been under sustained scrutiny for the last 12 months amid data leaks privacy concerns and other issues.

Just this week billions of Chrome users were urged to update certain settings to stop Google from tracking their every move.

Moscow has increased pressure on Big Tech this year in a campaign that critics characterise as an attempt by the Russian authorities to exert tighter control over the internet something they say threatens individual and corporate freedom.

Google said in an email it would study the court ruling on Friday before deciding on further steps.

Later on Friday the court fined Meta Platforms $27.15m on the same grounds. Russia’s communication watchdog Roskomnadzor said that Facebook and Instagram failed to remove 2000 pieces that violate Russian laws whereas Google keeps 2600 pieces of banned content.

Meta Platforms did not immediately respond to request for comment.

Russia has imposed small fines on foreign technology companies throughout this year but Friday’s penalties mark the first time it has exacted a percentage of a company’s annual Russian turnover greatly increasing the sum of the fine.

It did not specify the percentage although calculations by the Reuters news agency show Google’s fine equates to just over 8 percent.

Russia has ordered companies to delete posts promoting drug abuse and dangerous pastimes information about homemade weapons and explosives as well as ones by groups it designates as extremist or “terrorist”.

Google which has paid more than $434560 in fines over content violations this year is at odds with Moscow on a number of issues.

Russia has demanded it restore access to state-backed broadcaster RT’s German-language channels.

Last week a sanctioned Russian businessman claimed victory over Google in a court case that could see the tech giant hit with another heavy fine.

Moscow has also demanded that 13 foreign and mostly US technology companies which include Google and Meta Platforms be set up on Russian soil by January 1 or face possible restrictions or outright bans.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmR3LmNvbS9lbi9ydXNzaWFuLWNvdXJ0LWZpbmVzLWdvb2dsZS1mYWNlYm9vay1vdmVyLWJhbm5lZC1jb250ZW50L2EtNjAyNTA1NTHSAVhodHRwczovL2FtcC5kdy5jb20vZW4vcnVzc2lhbi1jb3VydC1maW5lcy1nb29nbGUtZmFjZWJvb2stb3Zlci1iYW5uZWQtY29udGVudC9hLTYwMjUwNTUx?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Russia fines Google Facebook over banned content,"Moscow has accused Google and Facebook's parent company Meta of failing to remove illegal content from their platforms. It's the latest blow against tech giants in the Eastern European country.

A Moscow court on Friday ordered Google's Alphabet Inc. to pay a 7.2 billion ruble ($98 million/€87 million) fine for failing to remove content Russia deemed illegal.

The US company had previously been fined in Russia for the same reason but Friday's penalty is the biggest so far.

Russian news agency Interfax reported that the fine was calculated from a percentage of Google's annual earnings.

Google said it would study the Moscow court decision before taking any further action.

Later Friday Facebook parent company Meta received a 1.9 billion ruble ($27 million) court fine again for failing to remove banned content.

Twitter was also issued a fine of 3 million rubles ($40000) on Thursday for not removing banned content.

Russia cracking down on US tech giants

The rulings are the latest blow to US tech companies doing business in the region.

Moscow urged foreign tech giants in November to set up physical operations in Russia by the end of the year. The demand was aimed at not only Google but also Meta Twitter and TikTok.

Russia has warned these companies that additional restrictions or an outright ban would occur if they fail to comply with the order.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has previously railed against US big tech companies and their pervasive influence.

""These are not just economic giants in some areas they are de facto competing with states"" Putin said during the virtual Davos economic summit in January.

Google warned it could be blocked

Russia's State Duma deputy Alexander Khinshtein said in remarks quoted by Russian news agencies that the fine ""does not in any way interfere with the further work of Google.""

""But I must remind you that the legislation provides for other forms of response and so-called methods of coercion which include slowing down traffic and complete blocking in Russia'' he added.

Russia has demanded big tech platforms take down ""extremist"" content. Critics have said the Russian government is using extremism as a pretext to censor content critical of the Kremlin such as photos or information about anti-government protests.

(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp said on Friday it will not participate in person at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2022 in Las Vegas joining a list of companies opting not to have a physical presence at next month's event on concerns over the rapid spread of the Omicron COVID-19 variant.

The U.S. software giant added that it will continue to participate at CES remotely according to an emailed statement. The Verge was the first to report on Friday that Microsoft will not participate physically AT CES.

Several other companies including U.S. automaker General Motors Co Alphabet Inc.'s Google and its self-driving auto-technology company Waymo Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc Twitter Inc Lenovo Group AT&T Inc and Amazon.com Inc dropped in-person attendance plans earlier this week.

CES officials on Thursday said the event will still be held in person Jan. 5-8 with ""strong safety measures in place"" which include vaccination requirements masking and availability of COVID-19 tests.

The tech giant announced the news via its Chromium Bug tracker the codebase for Chrome and a solution to the issue is currently nowhere in sight.

It’s currently unclear what websites – and how many – are due to be affected by the problem.

Many of those that are will not likely know they’re affected until it’s already too late experts say.

Users of Chrome should brace themselves for disruption or find another browser to use until the issue is resolved a Forbes report said.

“Based on Google’s current release rate Chrome Canary users could be facing this decision as soon as next month while the billions of users running the browser’s stable version are looking at a 3-6 month countdown” the report forecasted.

NO SOLUTION IN SIGHT

According to the outlet the source of the issue comes down to version numbers of Chrome’s software.

The official version of Chrome is currently on version 96 while ‘Chrome Canary’ — the early access developer build — is already on version 99.

When the version reaches 100 websites affected by the glitch will apparently stop loading.

“The reason for this is these sites check the version of Chrome visiting the site but website design software like Duda only checks the first two digits” the report by Gordon Kelly reads.

So far there is no fix for the bug that could break websites worldwide. Getty

“The check is for security reasons to stop older unsupported versions of Chrome from visiting (version 40 and older is a common cut-off point) and Chrome 100 will be read as ‘Chrome 10’ and blocked.”

Google has been launching new versions of its Chrome software at a startling speed in recent months.

For instance Chrome 95 was only just released by the company in October.

Google is reportedly experimenting with a hack to stem the effects of the glitch.

That hack reportedly involves altering how its version numbers are displayed to ensure “99” is displayed in the first two digits in the version 100 update.

In the video Mackinac Island Mayor Margaret Doud explains how vital the service is to residents especially during a pandemic.

""We're an island so we can't always jump in our car and go and shop"" Doud said. ""When we enforced a lockdown on all our city buildings at points I wondered how we were going to get through it.""

""It's delivered right directly to your door just like it would be in a city but it's on a flatbed dray and a horse"" said Sara Chambers head of dray delivery operations.

Amazon has been heavily expanding into areas that the government designates for special tax incentives according to a new analysis that comes amid growing regulatory scrutiny of the e-commerce giant.

The company has located delivery stations fulfillment centers and even an air hub in ""opportunity zones"" regions across the country where investors can qualify for capital gains tax breaks under a 2017 law.

The initiative had bipartisan backing and was intended to incentivize investment in some of the most economically distressed regions of the country. But critics of the program have raised concerns that such programs further enrich wealthy investors and corporations for projects that would have happened without government assistance. And because there aren’t requirements that investors and corporations publicly report how they are using the tax breaks it’s difficult to measure impact. Experts say it’s impossible to know if the program is having the intended effect of creating jobs and affordable housing — or simply exacerbating economic divides.

Amazon has opened 153 facilities in these zones since 2018 accounting for more than 15% of the warehouses that it has opened in that time period according to the analysis from Good Jobs First a policy resource center working with subsidy data shared exclusively with The Washington Post. And 18 more facilities are scheduled to open in these areas in 2022 and 2023.

The findings underscore one of the potential ways that Amazon could take advantage of federal tax subsidies as it rapidly expands its delivery network. The company's relatively low tax bills have been at the center of a political firestorm. The Good Jobs First researchers say the company has received at least $650 million in government subsidies this year but that the expansion into opportunity zones highlights how the company could be receiving other tax breaks that are opaque to the public and difficult to track.

""More sunshine"" is needed to better track the opportunity zone program said Greg LeRoy executive director of Good Jobs First.

Amazon spokeswoman Julia Lawless said the company hasn't used the benefit in any of the 171 sites identified in the Good Jobs First analysis. (Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)

""We may use the [opportunity zone] benefit on future acquired sites as Congress intended it to help jump-start local economies in the types of areas we are investing in and creating jobs"" she said.

She added that the company ""does not actively seek out"" locations in the zones.

""If we locate in one of these areas it's because of our site selection criteria - from available land to access to talent - aligns with tracts that governments across all levels have previously identified for economic development; not because we utilized the [opportunity zone] benefit"" she said.

Opportunity zones could be a boon to big companies like Amazon that buy and sell many assets leading to capital gains. Companies can invest those gains into projects in opportunity zones allowing them to defer tax payments.

LeRoy says Amazon has been particularly aggressive in ""garnering available tax breaks."" The Good Jobs First report argues the expansion into opportunity zones is part of a much broader pattern where Amazon's rapid growth has been bolstered through government subsidies. This push into potentially advantageous markets comes as federal policymakers are applying increasing scrutiny to the company. Lawmakers have introduced legislation that takes aim at Amazon's alleged anticompetitive behavior and President Joe Biden has elevated some of the company's most prominent critics including Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan to key regulatory roles.

Amazon has rapidly expanded amid an e-commerce boom in part accelerated by the coronavirus pandemic. Good Jobs First estimates that Amazon has received $4.2 billion in U.S. subsidies through property tax abatements corporate income tax credits and even sales tax exemptions on building materials.

""You've got two functions of government fighting each other right now"" LeRoy said. ""You've got state and local governments fueling this monopolistic grab in the retail space accelerating the decline of brick-and-mortar retail. And you've got Uncle Sam finally smelling the coffee and realizing that maybe they have to look at the company through that lens.""

Amazon has a high-profile and controversial history of seeking government subsidies to expand its corporate footprint. In 2017 the company launched a nationwide search for its second headquarters. Faced with the promise of 50000 high-paying jobs cities aggressively competed to offer the company tax breaks and other incentives to attract the office. But after the company in 2018 announced it would split the new headquarters between Virginia and New York City it faced broad blowback from liberal politicians unions and community activists who argued taxpayer dollars should not be used to further enrich a tech giant and that the project would exacerbate income inequality in the city. The company ultimately dropped its plans to open the New York campus amid the criticism that the tax incentives would take government resources away from other key programs but pushed forward in Virginia.

However unlike the high-profile headquarters search the subsidies and incentives that Amazon receives for smaller local projects like warehouses data centers and offices often fly under the radar.

The role of opportunity zones in fueling corporate growth is especially opaque said David Wessel a senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution. The tax law does not mandate public disclosure of who is using the opportunity zone program and whether their projects are resulting in jobs or affordable housing. There have been some media reports about how individual investors have benefited from them but less attention on how large corporations have used them.

Lawmakers including Rep. Bill Pascrell Jr. D-N.J. have been calling for more robust reporting requirements around opportunity zones especially in the wake of a Government Accountability Office report that found the IRS does not have the necessary data to evaluate the efficacy of the program. Pascrell also criticized the fact that there is no cap on the amount that investors can receive through the program.

""Nationwide there is concern that the benefits are mostly flowing to those zones that were already ripe for development and could provide certain returns on investments"" Pascrell said at a recent hearing.

Darn no gift receipt.

How do I get rid of it?

What time will stores open Sunday?

Is there anyone I can regift this to?

Sometimes a gift doesn’t fit in more ways than one. However instead of settling for a duplicate gift or the ugly sweater you'll never wear you can return exchange or sell your unwanted holiday gifts.

The annual return-a-thon kicks off Sunday as retailers start after-Christmas sales aiming to unload more merchandise. But because of the pandemic and supply chain challenges there are fewer holiday items to discount.

►Happier returns?:Retailers in race to solve holidays' environmental logistics nightmare

According to its 18th annual return policy survey ConsumerWorld.org said prominent retailers continue to offer expanded return windows to give shoppers more time to return unwanted purchases.

Reverse logistics company Optoro predicts that $120 billion of goods will be returned this holiday season with a large percentage of those returns ending up in landfills.

Amazon holiday returns deadline is Jan. 31

Amazon says all return-eligible items weighing under 50 pounds have at least one free return option but some exclusions apply. Returns generally need to be completed 30 days after purchase but for the holiday season most Amazon purchases between Oct. 1 and Dec. 31 can be returned through Jan. 31 2022.

Start the Amazon return process on your account or Amazon.com/returns to select the purchase that needs to be returned. At the site you can also enter the order number of a gift if you have it.

The Amazon return process is different for gifts. Learn more about how to return gifts here.

Kohl's accepts Amazon returns and that can mean free Kohl's Cash

Kohl's accepts Amazon returns and there's no need to box up the return or print out a return label. As an added perk consumers bringing in these returns often get a coupon such as $5 Kohl's Cash or another discount to use at the department store chain. (Kohl's Cash is a coupon currency that can only be used at Kohl's. The Amazon return offers are listed as in-store only.)

If you have one return or a dozen you'll typically get just one Kohl's coupon. Some stores accept Amazon returns at customer service and others have separate designated areas for returns.

Pro Amazon return tip: Be prepared and logged into your Amazon account. Taking screenshots of the QR codes from Amazon can make the process easier. You can also flag emails with the return codes.

Box-free returns are also accepted at UPS Store locations Amazon Books Amazon 4-star Fresh Grocery and Whole Foods Market stores.

Tips for easier Christmas returns

Follow these tips and skip the post-holiday-gift-return headache:

Know the policies deadlines: Read policies at store websites on store signs or on the back of receipts.

Avoid the crowds: Early mornings and late evenings can be less chaotic times to make a return but immediately after Christmas you should expect long lines. It might be best to wait a few days.

Receipts: Having an original or gift receipt usually makes the return process go more smoothly and improves your chances of getting a full refund. At Target a gift receipt will get you a merchandise return card which – unlike a regular gift card – only can be used in-store.

No receipt: Returns without a receipt usually result in merchandise credit for the lowest recent sale price or possibly no refund or exchange at all depending on the store's policy.

Exchange it: Like the gift but want it in another color or size? Look for the item or ask for assistance and if it’s not in stock ask a store associate if it’s available online or at another store location.

Mystery gift: Not sure where a gift came from? If it has a barcode try scanning it with store apps like Amazon Walmart Target and other retailers. Also try typing the barcode numbers on Google.

Bring your ID: Even if you have a receipt some stores require a government-issued ID.

Extra fees: If you are returning electronics or an item that has been opened be prepared to pay a restocking fee of up to 15%.

Talk to a manager: If you have a problem returning a gift contact the store manager or the retailer's customer service department.

Be nice: Some returns are granted on a case-by-case basis so patience and kindness may go a long way.

Sell or donate it: If you can't return or exchange gifts consider selling them on eBay or similar apps and websites. Or donate them.

Indigenous women in Brazil have traditionally been excluded from taking on leadership roles that were often filled by tribal patriarchs. But those roles shifted in recent years as threats against their land rights and natural resources escalated.

Women are breaking down barriers speaking out and joining the frontlines of the battle against rampant deforestation extractive activities and the worsening climate catastrophe.

O-é Kaiapó Paiakan a member of the Mebêngôkre people in the Kayapó tribe of Brazil is one of those women. After her father the iconic Kayapó leader Paulinho Paiakan passed away from Covid-19 in June 2020 the 38-year-old took the reins as chief and is carrying her father’s legacy as one of the greatest pioneers of Brazil’s Indigenous environmental movement.

Fires burn in September along the Trans-Amazonian Highway near the Aripuanã National Forest in the state of Amazonas in Brazil. Deforestation continues at an extraordinary rate in the Amazon led by land clearing for meat producers and cattle ranchers along with illegal mining. The most common means of deforestation is by fire when ranchers burn the land in order to create farms to raise and graze cattle. Lynsey Addario

Paiakan said Indigenous women have always been powerful. But as climate and environmental threats worsen they are stepping out of the confines of their homes to attend college and find their voices in spaces traditionally dominated by men.

“Kayapó women have always been fighting” she said. “From us resistance is born. From us come men children life. The woman completes herself with nature and we have always been part of the resistance along with the men.”

""I feel saddress when I enter this land. This is land that our ancestors gave us"" Tejubi said. ""It's hard to express how I feel."" Lynsey Addario

Since becoming village chief Paiakan has been working hard to understand the legalities of protecting Indigenous territories and how to confront structures of power who are challenging their rights. She also created an educational space for tribal women to get involved and learn more about politics and the environmental threats they face.

“Women build the culture; the elder women have a very important role in keeping oral histories alive which they pass on to the children so we don’t lose our language and culture” Paiakan said. “Women today have been meeting to talk about these issues and they are taking space from the chiefs taking decisions along with them to coordinate their communities and be part of the political space where these issues are discussed.”

While environmental threats are not new in the Amazon the rise of the right-wing government under President Jair Bolsonaro allowed an explosion of industrial development from oil and gas exploration logging and mining. These activities have pushed deeper into the region razing trees on Indigenous land in search of profits.

The Bolsonaro administration and Brazil’s congress have aligned with the agribusiness mining and timber sectors to recently bring into law what’s known as “Marco Temporal” — a rule that says Indigenous peoples’ right to land will only be recognized if they can prove they occupied it in 1988 when the latest Brazilian constitution was adopted.

""From us resistance is born. From us come men children life. The woman completes herself with nature and we have always been part of the resistance along with the men."" Lynsey Addario

As Brazil’s supreme court considers arguments against the law Francisco Cali Tzay UN Special Rapporteur on the rights of Indigenous peoples said in August that its acceptance would “result in significant denial of justice.”

“If the Supreme Court accepts the so-called Marco Temporal (“time frame” argument) in its ruling on land demarcation later this month it could legitimize violence against indigenous peoples and inflame conflicts in the Amazon rainforest and other areas” Tzay said in a statement.

Paiakan says the law is a “reversal of Indigenous rights” which essentially opens avenues for the Brazilian government to gain the right to enter “our territory without our permission.”

“It’s as if we don’t exist in our territory; it’s as if we don’t exist for the state” she said. “They are doing all this to have access to our territory. But we are constantly aware and mobilizing following everything going on with Marco Temporal.”

Alessandra Korap 37 and a member of the Munduruku tribe in Brazil said Indigenous people are slowly losing their territory and with nowhere left to fish and harvest palm fronds she wanted to do something. As a woman however she said joining the male-dominated tribal meetings was frowned upon. Even her mother warned her against it.

But in 2015 Korap said she broke from tradition joined the chiefs and spoke about her concerns about public officials and businesses. She says she participated in meetings outside her village and protested against the demarcation of their land as well as infrastructure they deem hazardous to their territories.

The price of gold and other precious metals have soared during the Coronavirus pandemic which has led to an increase in illegal mining and deforestation in the Amazon. Lynsey Addario

“When I speak many people don’t like it because my voice reaches far” Korap said. “I don’t only speak for me or those close to me I speak for those beyond. Many people see this as a threat and want to get rid of me eliminate me because I begin to speak but I can’t be afraid.”

Threats surround her — a friend’s house was burned down as reports of other environmental defenders being attacked increased. Then she says she became a target herself. After days of protesting logging and mining activities in Brazil she said she and her husband came home with her children and found her home had been broken into. The thieves she said took their cellphones and flash drives from her camera.

“I perceived my voice was making someone uncomfortable” she said. “But I could not stop I need to help more as long as I have a voice I’m going to fight.”

According to a recent report by the environmental and human rights watchdog Global Witness Brazil — which includes a large part of the Amazon — was among the deadliest countries for environmental defenders with 20 activists killed in 2020 alone.

More than 70% of the attacks were on people defending forests — one of the planet’s natural carbon sinks — from further deforestation and industrial development the report said. And despite making up only 5% of the world’s population more than 30% of all the fatal attacks targeted Indigenous people in 2020.

Tejubi Uru eu Wau Wau’s uncle was one of those killed last year. Tejubi 21 and a member of the Uru-eu-Wau-Wau tribe in the state of Rondônia said her uncle had long been an environmental defender patroling Indigenous territories and protecting it against illegal logging as well as deforestation.

More than a year later Tejubi said they still don’t know how her uncle died but said she and the rest of the tribe blame his death on extractive industries.

“We were sad; we try to take care of everything” she said. “Only a week had gone by after my uncle passed my grandfather went into the forest to sing for his death and he found new invaders two White people hunting. They don’t respect us.”

Tejubi said deforestation continues to spread deeper into the forests and into their territories. In the late summer she joined protests against Marco Temporal and was met with pepper spray and smoke bombs she said. Still she plans to continue to fight for her tribe after she graduates.

“A lot of people think maybe I can’t handle it because I am a woman; I have to deal with a lot of machismo” she said. “Women make more of a difference because we work harder solve things and we are not afraid to speak our mind.”

A UN report released in March found that on average forests within Indigenous land in Latin America and the Carribean have been much better conserved than other forests in the region.

But these cultural tribal practices are constantly under threat from the effects of climate change as well as incursions by industry including fossil fuel production cattle ranching soy and palm oil extraction mining and logging. This industrial need for resources have increased road construction in the forests to make the region more accessible.

It’s what brought Txai Suruí a member of the Suruí tribe to the UN climate summit in Glasgow Scotland in November. The 24-year-old climate activist spoke to global leaders at the conference and drew attention to the devastating ecological and climate disasters that plague her land.

“Climate change and its consequences is something nature has been trying to warn us about for a long time but we never listened” she said in an interview before the climate summit. “Nature is saying ‘we don’t have any more time we don’t have time to slow down we have to stop.’ Nature is begging for help.”

Brazil went to the summit with ambitious climate promises including slashing emissions by 50% and it also joined other nations in agreeing to end illegal deforestation entirely by 2030 as well as achieving carbon neutrality by 2050.

But many questioned the credibility of the country’s promises given its recent track record. An analysis shows that deforestation in the Amazon increased by 33% in the first ten months of 2021 compared to the first ten months of 2020. In October a group of climate lawyers urged the International Criminal Court to investigate Bolsonaro for his alleged attacks on the Amazon forests which they describe as “crimes against humanity.”

For now the women intend to keep fighting to defend their land and forests the lungs of the planet from climate change and more industrial activities.

“The forest is our pharmacy the supermarket it is our way of life” Paiakan said. “Nature is part of us and hurting nature hurts us.”

“This is a story from our ancestors which is part of us. We lived here a long time” she said. “For a White man they don’t see value. They value devastation to plant soy and big plantations. To us nature is a natural wealth it is capital wealth.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5vdXJxdWFkY2l0aWVzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvYW1hem9uLWxvb2tzLXRvLW9wZW4tZGF2ZW5wb3J0LWNlbnRlci1pbi1zcHJpbmctb24tdG9wLW9mLXNwZW5kaW5nLTI1MG0taW4taW93YS1zaW5jZS0yMDEwL9IBjQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5vdXJxdWFkY2l0aWVzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvYW1hem9uLWxvb2tzLXRvLW9wZW4tZGF2ZW5wb3J0LWNlbnRlci1pbi1zcHJpbmctb24tdG9wLW9mLXNwZW5kaW5nLTI1MG0taW4taW93YS1zaW5jZS0yMDEwL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazon looks to open Davenport center in spring on top of spending $250M in Iowa since 2010,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://www.ourquadcities.com/news/local-news/amazon-looks-to-open-davenport-center-in-spring-on-top-of-spending-250m-in-iowa-since-2010/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5vdXJxdWFkY2l0aWVzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvYW1hem9uLWxvb2tzLXRvLW9wZW4tZGF2ZW5wb3J0LWNlbnRlci1pbi1zcHJpbmctb24tdG9wLW9mLXNwZW5kaW5nLTI1MG0taW4taW93YS1zaW5jZS0yMDEwL9IBjQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5vdXJxdWFkY2l0aWVzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvYW1hem9uLWxvb2tzLXRvLW9wZW4tZGF2ZW5wb3J0LWNlbnRlci1pbi1zcHJpbmctb24tdG9wLW9mLXNwZW5kaW5nLTI1MG0taW4taW93YS1zaW5jZS0yMDEwL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

As of Saturday afternoon Delta Airlines United Airlines JetBlue Airways and American Airlines had canceled a combined 950 Saturday flights.

Delta Air Lines canceled 308 flights on Christmas Day and has already canceled 69 flights scheduled for Sunday.

Saturday's cancellations come after United Delta and JetBlue canceled 454 Christmas Eve flights.

Delta Air Lines canceled 173 flights for Christmas Eve. The airline says the ""flight cancellations are due to a combination of issues including but not limited to potential inclement weather in some areas and the impact of the omicron variant.""

""Delta teams have exhausted all options and resources -- including rerouting and substitutions of aircraft and crews to cover scheduled flying -- before canceling around 90 flights for Friday"" Delta said in a Friday statement to ABC News. ""We apologize to our customers for the delay in their holiday travel plans. Delta people are working hard to get them to where they need to be as quickly and as safely as possible on the next available flight.""

And it's not just Delta that's feeling the impact of the variant on crews.

As of Saturday afternoon United had canceled 240 Christmas Day flights and 85 flights scheduled for Sunday. It had canceled 201 flights on Christmas Eve.

""The nationwide spike in omicron cases this week has had a direct impact on our flight crews and the people who run our operation"" United said in a statement on Friday. ""As a result we've unfortunately had to cancel some flights and are notifying impacted customers in advance of them coming to the airport.""

""We're sorry for the disruption and are working hard to rebook as many people as possible and get them on their way for the holidays"" the airline added.

JetBlue has canceled 123 Christmas Day flights due to COVID issues. It had canceled 80 flights Christmas Eve.

""Like many businesses and organizations we have seen an increasing number of sick calls from Omicron"" JetBlue said in a statement Friday. ""We entered the holiday season with the highest staffing levels we've had since the pandemic began and are using all resources available to us to cover our staffing needs. Despite our best efforts we've had to cancel a number of flights and additional flight cancellations and other delays remain a possibility as we see more Omicron community spread.""

Alaska Airlines has resorted to offering extra pay to their healthy employees who can work added shifts into this upcoming Christmas weekend.

The airline says they have had to cancel 10 Christmas Eve flights due to some of their employees quarantining after reporting that they may have been exposed to COVID-19.

American Airlines canceled 88 flights on Christmas Day.

""Our operation has been running smoothly and unfortunately a number of COVID-related sick calls led us to make the difficult decision to precancel some flights scheduled for today"" a representative for American Airlines said in a statement to ABC News on Saturday. ""We proactively notified affected customers yesterday and are working hard to rebook them quickly. We never want to disappoint our customers and apologize for any disruptions to their holiday travel plans.""

Airlines for America the group that lobbies on behalf of all major U.S. airlines is calling on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to shorten the quarantine time for fully vaccinated individuals saying the omicron surge may create ""significant"" disruptions.

""The omicron surge may exacerbate personnel shortages and create significant disruptions to our workforce and operations"" Nick Calio A4A's CEO said in a letter on Thursday to CDC Director Rochelle Walensky.

Calio proposed the isolation period to be shortened to five days from symptom onset for breakthrough infections.

""In turn those individuals would be able to end isolation with an appropriate testing protocol"" Calio wrote.

The letter comes after Delta Air Lines and JetBlue Airways both A4A members also asked for isolation periods for fully vaccinated individuals to be shortened.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcnBvcnQtdGVjaG5vbG9neS5jb20vbmV3cy9pbmRpZ28ta2xtLWFpci1mcmFuY2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Indigo signs codeshare pact with KLM and Air France,"A code sharing agreement allows airline companies to sell seats on a flight operated by another company.

India’s low-cost airline IndiGo has reportedly entered into a codeshare alliance with Air France and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines the respective countries’ national carriers.

Subject to the nod of the Government of India the agreement is expected to become effective in February next year.

A code sharing agreement allows airline companies to sell seats on a flight operated by another company.

The agreement also enables airline companies to market the same flight under their own airline designator and flight number.

As per the agreement IndiGo customers will have access to Air France and KLM global network which covers more than 250 destinations across the globe.

The Air France and KLM network comprise 120 destinations in Europe and about 50 in the America.

As of Dec. 14 there have been 1030 such incidents investigated by the Federal Aviation Administration this year up from 183 investigations in 2020 according to data available on the FAA’s website.

Crew members on flights to and from Colorado have dealt with their share of incidents from passengers refusing to wear masks to the physical assault of flight attendants. In January President Joe Biden announced a federal mask mandate for passengers using public transportation and has since extended the mandate through March.

Landon Perry Grier of Cañon City was charged with interfering with a flight crew on a flight from Seattle to Denver in March. Grier refused to put on a mask after being asked “eight to ten times” and after he ignored the flight attendant he struck her arm according to a statement from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Colorado. Later passengers notified a different flight attendant that Grier was urinating in his seat.

Grier said he was returning from Alaska where he had been working in a gold mine and that prior to leaving Alaska he had one beer and then had “three to four beers and a ‘couple of shots’” prior to boarding the plane in Seattle according to an FBI affidavit. He told an FBI airport liaison agent that he took an over-the-counter pain reliever because he had body aches from working.

Grier was found guilty of assault by striking and was sentenced to three years of probation according to court documents filed last month.

Alaska Airlines has seen a 25% increase in disruptive behavior this year compared to 2020 according to Cailee Olson the media relations manager for Alaska Airlines.

The behavior

Last month Brain Hsu of California was charged with interference with flight crew and assault stemming from an October incident on a flight bound to California from New York which was diverted to Denver.

Denver police officers who spoke to the flight crew heard that Hsu assaulted a female flight attendant and saw the flight attendant bleeding “from or around her nose” according to a criminal complaint. She was taken to a hospital by ambulance.

Hsu told authorities that he was flying home from New York after receiving brain surgery in Rhode Island.

The FAA proposed a $15000 fine for a passenger flying to Denver in December 2020 who allegedly drank alcohol that the airline did not serve to him in front of flight attendants who were telling him it was against the law to drink alcohol he brought on the plane.

The FAA “proposes” fines because passengers have the right to due process Ian Gregor public affairs specialist for the FAA wrote in an email. There are several options for a passenger who faces a civil penalty for unruly behavior.

The FAA recommended a $9000 fine against a passenger on a separate Alaska Airlines flight in February. The passenger who was flying from Denver to Seattle allegedly interfered with crew members after he refused to wear a mask hid a flight attendant’s jacket under his seat and punched a window and tray table according to an FAA statement.

This passenger was banned from flying Alaska and Horizon immediately after the incident and will remain on the list indefinitely Olson wrote in an email. The flight attendant has since returned to work.

Passengers have a month to respond after receiving an enforcement letter from the FAA.

The FAA proposed a $9000 fine against a passenger on a January flight from Denver to Arizona who interfered with crew members after he refused to comply with the mask mandate.

The FAA recommended over $20000 in fines for an American Airlines passenger who allegedly verbally abused flight attendants after she realized her seat would not recline struck a flight attendant and refused to comply with the mask policy during her flight to Aspen in March according to a statement last month.

An American Airlines spokesperson declined Newsline’s request for an interview and wrote “we have nothing to add” when asked if they want to respond about this incident.

The FAA proposed a $7500 fine for a passenger who allegedly would not comply with the mask requirement on a February flight from Denver to California. The passenger refused to get off the plane so the airline deboarded the other passengers and as a result the flight was delayed by almost 40 minutes.

The FAA also proposed a $7500 fine for a passenger on a February flight from Florida to Denver who allegedly refused to comply with the mask requirement.

Robert Vincent Allen of Pennsylvania pleaded guilty to the attempted destruction of an aircraft after starting a fire on a flight last year causing the pilot to divert the plane into Denver. Allen was sentenced to three years of probation and over $10000 in fines according to court documents.

Increase in unruly behavior

There was a rate of over five unruly-passenger incidents per 10000 flights in the last week in November and the first week of December according to data available on the FAA’s website.

The FAA investigates all unruly passenger reports that they receive from airlines to determine if there was a violation of federal aviation regulations or laws Gregor wrote. If the FAA determines that a violation occurred they initiate an enforcement action.

“We are referring egregious unruly passenger cases to the FBI for criminal prosecution review” Gregor wrote. Between Dec. 7 and 14 there were over 100 unruly passenger reports and over 20 enforcement cases initiated.

Alaska Airlines has seen a 25% increase in disruptive behavior in 2021 over 2020 which was 50% more than seen in 2019. “We’re also seeing many more instances of more severe incidents where passengers threatened employees or interfered with flight crew duties"" Olson added.



Last month Attorney General Merrick Garland directed U.S. Attorneys to prioritize the prosecution of federal crimes that occur on commercial flights that endanger the safety of passengers and flight crews.

Previously the FAA closed unruly incident cases with warning notices civil penalties or other measures according to the FAA's website but that's changed: “Under our current zero-tolerance policy toward unruly passengers we are not addressing cases with warning notices or counseling.”

Airlines for America an industry trade group joined other organizations in sending a June letter to Garland asking that more be done to “deter egregious behavior” on flights.

“Specifically the federal government should send a strong and consistent message through criminal enforcement that compliance with federal law and upholding aviation safety are of paramount importance” the letter said.

At the same time saying that despite the efforts of the FAA and airlines incidents continue and some are intensifying.

“Unfortunately we continue to see onboard behavior deteriorating into heinous acts including assaults threats and intimidation of crewmembers that directly interfere with the performance of crewmember duties and jeopardize the safety and security of everyone onboard the aircraft” Airlines for America president Nicholas Calio wrote in a separate letter to FAA administrator Steve Dickson.

The causes

Though there are a number of contributing factors including alcohol much of the spike in unruly behavior has been linked with passengers who refuse to comply with the federal face mask requirement.

“There is no one root cause of the increase in disruptive behavior but masks are a catalyst in more than 75% of incidents” Olson wrote. Alaska Airlines has enhanced de-escalation training for their customer-facing employees to identify and defuse situations.

Nico Harrison was on a United Airlines flight to Denver from Montana last month and was seated next to a man who was wearing a mask at the start of the flight but removed it shortly after boarding. “Even though they announced at the start of the flight that masks were required the stewardess clearly saw that this man was not obeying this rule and did not say a word to him” Harrison wrote in an email.

Harrison of Montana complained via the United app but did not get a response so he complained to the Department of Transportation who forwarded his complaint to the airline.

United wrote to Harrison that the safety of passengers and the crew are “of the utmost importance” and that they expect every team member to uphold and enforce the mask policy according to an email shared by Harrison with Newsline. The airline representative wrote that she will share Harrison’s experience with the inflight management team so they can follow-up internally.

Luke DiMarco was on a flight from Denver to Toronto in September when a passenger was removed from the plane for not wearing a mask DiMarco wrote in a Twitter message. After the man was escorted off the plane by two crew members the captain made an announcement that the passenger had been removed. DiMarco wrote that the incident was pretty well received by the passengers: “I think most were just in disbelief that someone would come all this way to refuse to wear a mask and miss his flight.”

Zero-tolerance policy

In January the FAA announced its zero-tolerance policy towards unruly and dangerous behavior. Passengers who break violations or laws are now issued fines rather than compliance or administrative actions pursuant to an order signed by Dickson.

“The FAA has recently observed a proliferation of such conduct including conduct stemming from the failure to wear masks in response to the COVID-19 pandemic-related health measures in place on board aircraft or conduct following the January 6 2021 violence at the U.S. Capitol” the order says.

Several Coloradans have been charged in connection to the insurrection on Jan. 6. The attack occurred during a Joint Session of the U.S. Congress which was in the process of confirming the results from the 2020 presidential election.

The FAA created a “zero tolerance for unruly and dangerous behavior toolkit” which includes signs for airports to display and social media memes.

A spokesperson for Denver International Airport declined an interview request saying that the airport has been “fortunate to not have encountered issues” like those that have been widely reported.

The FAA announced in September that since the zero-tolerance policy began unruly behavior incidents have dropped almost in half but still remain more than twice as high as at the end of 2020.

Under a new partnership between the FAA and the Transportation Security Administration the FAA announced on Tuesday that they will share with the TSA the information and names of passengers who have been charged with unruly behavior. The TSA may then remove the passenger from TSA PreCheck screening eligibility.

“This partnership with FAA will help ensure the safety and security of all passengers and hold those who violate federal regulations accountable for their actions” TSA Administrator David Pekoske said in the statement.

The Mount Hermon area resident said the frequency of outages has become worse the last year or so and she has had to purchase a generator.

“What really bothers me is how often these are happening” Abbott said Tuesday. “It almost never happened in the past unless there was a big storm or something. Now it’s happening on pleasant days with nothing that might be causing it due to weather.”

When she was contacted Tuesday morning by the Danville Register & Bee Abbott’s power had just come back on after being out for 45 minutes.

“I was at my mailbox and heard a crackle in the line over my head...” she said of the moment when her power went out. “This was the third time in about a month.”

Abbott’s outage that morning came just three days after another that occurred while American Electric Power was performing maintenance on its system. Danville Utilities stopped receiving power from one of its delivery points from AEP and several substations went offline for nearly 30 minutes as a result.

“It certainly did affect a lot of people” said Danville Utilities Director Jason Grey.

The city’s West Fork delivery point project will help prevent situations like the one that arose Dec. 18 Grey said. Danville Utilities’ fourth Appalachian Power delivery point will be constructed in Brosville and should be complete in 2023.

“That delivery point has been in conceptual design” Grey said. “We’re looking at buying property for it. If we had that project up and running we would have had another delivery point that would have prevented what happened [Dec. 18].”

Danville City Council voted in July to buy 42.85 acres next to the West Fork electric substation for $180000 to expand the substation’s footprint in Brosville and add a fourth Appalachian Power delivery point.

The purchase would allow a new Appalachian Power transmission line and substation at the property.

The West Fork substation sits on about five acres on Long Circle off U.S. 58.

Danville Utilities’ existing delivery points for Appalachian Power are off Kentuck Road at Riverside Drive and Arnett Boulevard and at the Danville Utilities location at Monument Street.

Danville Utilities distributes electricity to about 42000 customer locations in a 500-square-mile service territory covering Danville the southern third of Pittsylvania County and small portions of Henry and Halifax counties. It also provides natural gas water wastewater and telecommunications services in Danville.

Appalachian Power’s transmission line would be a 138-kilovolt line and the substation would include a control building several breakers and metering equipment.

Danville Utilities operates 17 substations.

The recent delivery point issue occurred at the Riverside substation at Riverside Drive and Arnett Boulevard.

Riverside substation is a vital part of Danville Utilities that serves about a quarter of the city’s customers.

One of the current three delivery points for the city’s system it provides power to almost 10000 customers on both sides of the Dan River.

The Riverside substation sends power to customers in neighborhoods bounded by Guilford Street to the north the Old West End neighborhood to the south Piney Forest Road to the west and the King Memorial Bridge to the east.

It also feeds substations areas of the county including those in Brosville Whitmell and Mount Hermon.

The substation was upgraded in the summer of 2020. The project cost about $6 million and involved the replacement of all of the substation’s three transformers switches circuit breakers and other aging equipment. Before the improvements a lot of the equipment dated back to substation’s construction in the 1960s.

The outages

As for power outages Westover Drive area resident Cindi Fisher has experienced power outages at her Fox Hollow home five times recently.

“Power outages seem to have increased over the time I have lived in this part of the city” Fisher said adding that she has resided in Fox Hollow for more than 10 years.

Some of her neighbors have bought standby generators she said.

In addition to the loss of electricity that occurred Dec. 18 three short outages happened at Fisher’s home on the morning of Dec. 12 she said.

“In total it was not out that long but it caused a power surge in my house that killed my modem” Fisher said.

She called her internet provider and had her modem replaced at the city’s expense she said.

Fisher also lost electricity the first week of this month while she was at work.

“Power outages are not new to the Westover area but there are no weather-related events that caused any of the outages at my house this month” she said.

Before the outages became more common for Fisher’s neighborhood she felt like she and her neighbors were lucky to be spared when most of the Westover area was without power. But that has changed.

“Now I find it more of a nuisance” she said.

Isolated problems

Grey said the city has had more isolated outages because of fallen trees or animals such as squirrels or birds making contact with power lines.

“Not all outages are caused by us” Grey said. “They’re caused by Mother Nature. We’re here to react to that and do what we can to prevent them going forward.”

The city has performed a lot of right-of-way maintenance — such as tree-trimming — over the past several years to reduce incidents but birds and squirrels can still climb and fly onto poles and lines Grey said.

Car wrecks also have caused outages when poles are struck including one that occurred Wednesday morning and shut down power in part of Danville Utilities’ service area Grey said.

“That seems to happen a lot more than I think it should” he said. “A lot of customers don’t realize how many vehicle accidents we have.”

Substations

As for new substations projects were completed at Kentuck in October and at Whitmell last week Grey said.

Crews have now moved on to building new substations at Westover off Woodlawn Drive and at Southside near Danville Community College Grey said.

Westover and Southside serve about 5600 and 3400 customers respectively.

The Westover substation serves a vast area including Dry Fork the Berry Hill Road area and parts of Danville.

Southside covers the area from West Main Street and at Averett University in Danville heading south in the Grove Park area Southwyck Druid Hills and Stratford Place to the North Carolina line.

The Westover substation was built in 1975 and Southside’s substation was built in 1972.

Those projects are expected to be complete by next summer Grey said.

Newer equipment and increasing redundancy having dual transformers at a substation improves reliability he said. Dual transformers will be at Westover and Southside substations as part of their projects enabling the electrical load to be evenly split among the transformers and moved from one transformer to another whenever there is an issue.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGlsbC5jb20vY2hhbmdpbmctYW1lcmljYS9zdXN0YWluYWJpbGl0eS9lbnZpcm9ubWVudC81ODcxNTItbHVtYmVyLWNvbXBhbnktcmV0dXJucy13YXRlcmZyb250LXByb3BlcnR5LXRvL9IBeWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGlsbC5jb20vY2hhbmdpbmctYW1lcmljYS9zdXN0YWluYWJpbGl0eS9lbnZpcm9ubWVudC81ODcxNTItbHVtYmVyLWNvbXBhbnktcmV0dXJucy13YXRlcmZyb250LXByb3BlcnR5LXRvL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lumber company returns waterfront property to Native American tribe in Washington state at no cost,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://thehill.com/changing-america/sustainability/environment/587152-lumber-company-returns-waterfront-property-to/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGlsbC5jb20vY2hhbmdpbmctYW1lcmljYS9zdXN0YWluYWJpbGl0eS9lbnZpcm9ubWVudC81ODcxNTItbHVtYmVyLWNvbXBhbnktcmV0dXJucy13YXRlcmZyb250LXByb3BlcnR5LXRvL9IBeWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGlsbC5jb20vY2hhbmdpbmctYW1lcmljYS9zdXN0YWluYWJpbGl0eS9lbnZpcm9ubWVudC81ODcxNTItbHVtYmVyLWNvbXBhbnktcmV0dXJucy13YXRlcmZyb250LXByb3BlcnR5LXRvL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhdmV1ci5jb20vZm9vZC90aGUtY2hpcHBlZC1wbHVnLWluLXJvYXN0ZXItdGhhdC1hbmNob3JzLW15LWhvbGlkYXlzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Chipped Plug-In Roaster That Anchors My Holidays,"That time of year has arrived when I haul my vintage 1940s electric roaster out of storage and crank it on for the annual holiday turkey roast. The generations of home cooks in my family who did so before me are long gone but that old Nesco Roastryte keeps going re-anchoring me to this season from which I’ve occasionally disconnected when loss or upheaval intervened. Each time its red light blinks on I’m a little more grateful.

“Years and years of turkeys in that roaster” my father-in-law Kevin Hennessy recently recalled. “I don’t think we ever had to repair it.”

The Milwaukee-based National Enameling and Stamping Company released the first iteration of its portable electric roaster oven in 1931—which was then toted around rural parts of the state by the Wisconsin Electrical Company to promote the use of electricity in homes which until then relied on wood-burning stoves. (Today the snappier-named Nesco makes all manner of slow cookers and pressure cookers meat grinders and dehydrators and a sleek line of porcelain-walled roasters that scarcely resemble those early models.)

My family’s Roastryte—a hulking enameled-steel cooker whose manufacture date we unscientifically placed sometime in the 1940s—has endured through four generations and counting. My husband Sean’s late grandmother a no-nonsense Irish American named Pat Hennessy probably inherited the roaster from her mother Margaret McGuire. Pat in turn passed down the roaster to her son Kevin and his wife Betsy (my husband’s parents) when they took up the mantle of hosting Thanksgiving at their suburban Chicago home with scarcely enough oven space for Betsy’s legendary pies. She would therefore balance the cooker on a card table in the den amidst baskets heaped with her knitting supplies and stacks of Kevin’s historical-nonfiction reads that spilled over from the bookcase. Sometimes when living-room space was scarce the roaster was relegated to the basement—the bird’s delicious muted aromas wafting up the rickety staircase.

The first time I laid eyes on the Roastryte I’d brought my parents and sister over to my future in-laws’ home for our first Thanksgiving together. Sweating anxiously through my collared polyester dress I perched on the couch opposite the roaster its windowed lid beading with condensation while a 20-pound turkey sizzled away inside. Though the living room was furnished with reminders that this was not a place for cooking this disembodied oven with its chipped facade industriously subverted that order. Something about that heartened me. I’d later come to associate that image with the roaster’s genially subversive then-owner Betsy whose snowman turtleneck and sweater-vest sets belied a deceptively progressive core.

A few years later barely three weeks after Thanksgiving in 2009 Betsy died of ovarian cancer and Sean and I inherited the Roastryte somewhere in an unending fog of grief. We shoved it into a storage locker while trying to survive a holiday season that for us held only pain and loss.

In 2012 after Kevin remarried and Sean and I bought our first place on Chicago’s northwest side it was our turn to host a newly knitted-together family for Thanksgiving dinner served on Betsy’s toile-patterned china. Oven space was scant owing to my overwrought lineup of appetizers and sides so we hauled out the Roastryte and set it on a wooden end table in the office its edges looming precariously above the newly re-carpeted floor.

When I cracked the appliance’s lid to check the turkey’s temperature an hour later Betsy materialized in my mind amid the rush of steam to hover approvingly over my shoulder in her favorite frilly apron. She cheerfully recounted one year when the baster misfired and sprayed the carpet instead of the turkey.

Unsure if that story was real or imagined I felt comforted all the same my shoulders relaxing a few inches—new carpet be damned! The cooker belonged wherever it was roasting the centerpiece of a holiday feast. And in the end the bird came out flawlessly—the skin golden and crackly the meat miraculously moist. The rest of the dinner however flopped spectacularly. Someone didn’t like the wine; someone else had too much and decided to bring up politics. Or was it religion?

The following year Sean and I flew to Palm Springs for a steakhouse Thanksgiving of prime rib and ice-cold martinis. For a few more seasons the roaster lay dormant as we spent holidays away from home—skipping one Christmas gifts and all to fly to Austria with my sister and brother-in-law; driving up to Taos New Mexico another Thanksgiving to grill stuffed chickens. But inevitably Sean and I would return from these trips with a hankering for a stuffed holiday turkey and plug in the roaster for a late-January feast. Its light would kick on to register its approval at another year of burnt turkey fat decorating its already well-seasoned interior.

On the Roastryte’s lustrous gold temperature panel is a whole host of suggested temperatures for the many dishes one might cook in the appliance: 275 degrees Fahrenheit for baked beans; 325 for poultry custard; 375 for onions cakes and fish (my favorite tier); 400 for cookies and apples. Each year that we bring the roaster out I announce that this time I will cook something other than turkey in it. But I never do.

When I asked Kevin if previous Roastryte owners ever used it for say a pork roast or cobbler he replied decisively: “Roaster was used only for turkeys. It had a turkey funk in it.”

As another holiday season descends the roaster again hibernates in a storage unit some 1500 miles away from its longtime Chicago home along with the rest of the life that Sean and I uprooted to Southern New Mexico this past fall. We’ll haul it out just in time for Christmas but our new high-desert home buried in boxes isn’t quite up to hosting yet.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL3dvcmxkL2FzaWEtcGFjaWZpYy9rYXdhc2FraS1oZWF2eS1zYXlzLWxpcXVlZmllZC1oeWRyb2dlbi1jYXJyaWVyLWRlcGFydHMtamFwYW4tYXVzdHJhbGlhLTIwMjEtMTItMjQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kawasaki Heavy says liquefied hydrogen carrier departs Japan for Australia,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/kawasaki-heavy-says-liquefied-hydrogen-carrier-departs-japan-australia-2021-12-24/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL3dvcmxkL2FzaWEtcGFjaWZpYy9rYXdhc2FraS1oZWF2eS1zYXlzLWxpcXVlZmllZC1oeWRyb2dlbi1jYXJyaWVyLWRlcGFydHMtamFwYW4tYXVzdHJhbGlhLTIwMjEtMTItMjQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Statement credits are typically received within a few days however it may take 90 days after an eligible prepaid hotel booking is charged to the Card Account. American Express relies on the merchant’s processing of transactions to determine the transaction date. The transaction date may differ from the date you made the purchase if for example there is a delay in the merchant submitting the transaction to us or if the merchant uses another date as the transaction date. This means that in some cases your purchase may not earn the statement credit benefit for the benefit period in which you made the purchase. For example if an eligible purchase is made on December 31st but the merchant processes the transaction such that it is identified to us as occurring on January 1st then the statement credit available in the next calendar year will be applied. Statement credits may not be received or may be reversed if the booking is cancelled or modified. If the Card Account is canceled or past due it may not qualify to receive a statement credit. If American Express does not receive information that identifies your transaction as eligible you will not receive the statement credits. For example your transaction will not be eligible if it is a booking: (i) made with a property not included in the Fine Hotels + Resorts or The Hotel Collection programs (ii) not made through American Express Travel or (iii) not made with an eligible Card. Participating properties and their availability are subject to change. If American Express in its sole discretion determines that you have engaged in or intend to engage in any manner of abuse misuse or gaming in connection with this benefit American Express will not have an obligation to provide and may reverse any statement credits provided to you. If a charge for an eligible purchase is included in a Pay Over Time balance on your Card Account the statement credit associated with that charge may not be applied to that Pay Over Time balance.

To get your free massage you'll need to present your same-day boarding pass along with your Priority Pass Select membership card. The benefit is restricted to one visit per cardholder at all locations — except for the DTW spa near Gate A18 which allows cardholders to bring along one guest.

Unfortunately American Express has eliminated restaurant access and other non-lounge activities from its Priority Pass offering. So if you have a card such as The Platinum Card® from American Express (enrollment required) or the Marriott Bonvoy Brilliant® American Express® Card that comes with Priority Pass you won't be eligible for a free massage (or a visit to any of the participating Priority Pass restaurant locations).

The good news is that other premium credit cards through other issuers such as Capital One Chase and Citi are eligible for this benefit. Below we've listed some of the top cards that offer Priority Pass Select membership:

Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card: $395 annual fee.

Chase Sapphire Reserve: $550 annual fee.

The Ritz-Carlton Credit Card (no longer available to new applicants) : $450 annual fee.

Citi Prestige® Card (no longer available to new applicants): $450 annual fee.

Bottom line

If the lounge is overcrowded I know I'll be beelining straight to the Be Relax spas for my free massage. Not only that but I'm excited that this is the first Priority Pass benefit at JFK's Terminal 5 JetBlue's terminal that currently only has one airport lounge.

Disney Coca-Cola American Express Bank of America Lowe's and Pfizer faced accusations that they trained employees on certain ""woke"" ideas such as putting ""marginalized"" staff above ""privileged"" staff learning to ""decolonize"" their minds"" and combating aspects of an alleged ""White supremacy culture"" such as perfectionism individualism and objectivity.

These ideas trace back to critical race theory (CRT) — a framework that involves deconstructing aspects of society to discover systemic racism beneath the surface. Current and former employees at American Express told Fox News that the change began after the police-involved killing of George Floyd in May 2020 but the ""woke"" trainings came to light in 2021.

AMERICAN EXPRESS CRT TRAINING URGED STAFF TO ADOPT A HIERARCHY PUTTING ‘MARGINALIZED’ ABOVE ‘PRIVILEGED’

In February a whistleblower at Coca-Cola claimed that the company forced employees to take a seminar teaching them to ""be less white."" The whistleblower posted photos of a seminar giving tips to ""be less white"" including ""be less arrogant be less certain be less defensive be more humble listen believe break with apathy"" and ""break with white solidarity."" The materials claimed that White people in the United States and other western nations are ""socialized to feel that they are inherently superior because they are white.""

Yet Coca-Cola told Fox Business that the slides ""are not part of the company's learning curriculum.""

Coca-Cola President Alfredo Rivera apologized for the situation in March.

""Recently we learned that content accessible through our company training platform did not align with"" being ""respectful for all"" he said.

While this material was not part of the training curriculum Rivera said ""We apologize to those who were offended by this content. We would never encourage anyone to be any less of themselves.""

In March Manhattan Institute Senior Fellow Chris Rufo revealed whistleblower documents from the Walt Disney Company's diversity and inclusion program ""Reimagine Tomorrow."" The program includes multiple training modules on ""antiracism.""

The modules tell employees that they must ""take ownership of educating [themselves] about structural anti-Black racism."" The modules claim that the U.S. has a ""long history of systemic racism and transphobia"" and that White employees must ""work through feelings of guilt shame and defensiveness to understand what is beneath them and what needs to be healed."" Another module encourages employees to reject ""equality"" focusing on ""equal treatment and access to opportunities"" and instead strive for ""equity"" focusing on ""the equality of outcome.""

PFIZER SETS RACE-BASED HIRING GOALS IN THE NAME OF FIGHTING ‘SYSTEMIC RACISM’ ‘GENDER EQUITY CHALLENGES’

Disney did not deny the training but insisted that whistleblowers took it out of context.

Ticker Security Last Change Change % DIS THE WALT DISNEY CO. 105.80 +0.02 +0.02%

""These internal documents are being deliberately distorted as reflective of company policy when in fact their purpose was to allow diversity of thought and discussion on the incredibly complex and challenging issues of race and discrimination that we as a society and companies nationwide are facing"" the company said in a statement.

In August Rufo published internal documents showing that American Express subjected its employees to a series of critical race theory training sessions that encouraged staff to rank themselves on a hierarchy of ""privilege"" and apply that hierarchy in the workplace with the more ""privileged"" employees deferring to staff from ""marginalized groups.""

In the trainings the outside consulting firm Paradigm urged Amex employees to construct their own intersectional identities mapping their ""race sexual orientation body type religion disability status age gender identity [and] citizenship"" on an official company worksheet. Employees could then determine whether they have ""privilege"" or are members of a ""marginalized group."" Whites males heterosexual people Christians able-bodied people and citizens would presumably count as ""privileged.""

The training sessions also warned White employees to avoid certain phrases such as ""I don't see color"" ""We are all human beings"" and ""Everyone can succeed in this society if they work hard enough"" as ""microaggressions.""

In a high-profile ""anti-racism"" event Amex executives invited Khalil Muhammad a great-grandson of Nation of Islam founder Elijah Muhammad to speak on ""race in corporate America."" He argued that capitalism was founded on racism and that ""racist logics and forms of domination"" have shaped Western society since at least the Industrial Revolution. He even argued that the credit card company should reduce standards for Black customers and sacrifice profits in the interest of race-based reparations.

""If American Express cares about racial justice in the world it can’t simply say the market’s going to define how we price certain customers who happen to come from low-income communities"" he said. ""If you want to do good then you’re going to have to set up products and [product] lines that don’t maximize profit.""

AMERICAN EXPRESS ENGAGES IN ‘REVERSE DISCRIMINATION’ AGAINST WHITE PEOPLE CURRENT AND FORMER EMPLOYEES SAY

In September five current and former AmEx employees — speaking on condition of anonymity — told FOX Business that the company singles out Black people for promotion in a practice that former employees described as reverse discrimination against White people. The employees did not present internal documents to demonstrate an official policy but they said they witnessed a worrisome trend that raises questions about racial discrimination in promotion. One former employee said they quit because the critical race theory trainings and the apparent promotion of employees due to skin color sent the message that White employees could not expect to even be considered for promotion.

American Express denied this accusation in a statement.

""We have a high-achieving culture and we are proud of our dedicated and highly engaged colleagues"" an American Express spokesperson told FOX Business. ""Advancement within our company is based solely on individual business and leadership performance. Any characterization of our company and culture to the contrary is just plain wrong.""

The statement also claimed that the company's ""diversity equity and inclusion programs"" focus on upholding a commitment to ""a diverse and inclusive culture where all colleagues feel welcome and heard and have equal opportunities to thrive regardless of their gender race ethnicity age religion sexual orientation and nationality."" The programs ""are not based on any specific theory nor are they directed to a specific group of employees.""

In August Rufo revealed documents showing that Bank of America Lowe's and Truist Financial Corporation sponsored a United Way critical race theory ""Racial Equity 21-Day Challenge"" claiming that America is systemically and institutionally racist encouraging participants to ""decolonize"" their minds and get ""woke at work"" and urging white people to ""cede power to people of color.""

The Racial Equity 21-Day Challenge included a document with responses to potential objections. Should participants ask about reverse discrimination the guide claims that there is no such thing. The document also claims that people of color cannot be racist: ""Racism is used to justify the position of the dominant group White people in this case and to uphold White supremacy and superiority. Everyone can be biased and engage in bigoted and belittling behavior that is intolerant of other perspectives. But racism is by definition a form of oppression exercised by the dominant racial group (Whites).""

BANK OF AMERICA LOWE'S SPONSORED CRT TRAINING URGING WHITES TO ‘CEDE POWER TO PEOPLE OF COLOR’

Bank of America spokesman Bill Haldin told FOX Business that his company does not endorse these ideas and that it does not run its own employee trainings along these lines.

""This was not our program and not our training materials"" he said. ""The United Way ran this program independent of Bank of America and it is not part of our training material.""

Lowe's and Truist Financial did not respond to FOX Business' request for comment.

The pharmaceutical company Pfizer has set goals to fill a percentage of leadership positions with Black and Hispanic candidates by the year 2025 in the name of fighting ""systemic racism."" In September FOX Business reported on an Environmental Social & Governance (ESG) Report 2020  published in March 2021 in which Pfizer set ""opportunity parity goals"" for 2025. Those goals include ""increasing our minority representation from 19% to 32% and doubling the underrepresented population of African Americans/Blacks and Hispanics/Latinos.""

The report includes a letter from Albert Bourla Pfizer's chairman and CEO in which Bourla says he is ""proud"" of having ""set concrete goals to address systemic racism and gender equity challenges by reviewing and augmenting our plans to increase diversity and opportunity parity by 2025 particularly focusing on increasing female and U.S. minority representation at leadership levels.""

""We now have quotas basically in hiring and promotions"" explained a current Pfizer employee who spoke with FOX Business on condition of anonymity. The employee said the company hosted events with Ibram X. Kendi and encouraged employees to read books written by Robin DiAngelo two prominent CRT proponents.

At this time of year we traditionally reflect upon our blessings and forgive those who have trespassed against us. But we’ve been trying that for millennia and the results have been unsatisfactory. So let’s discard the accumulated wisdom of all humanity’s spiritual traditions and focus our mental energy instead on how much we dislike various awful people around us. Merry Christmas.

1. Manchinema

Sens. Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema of West Virginia and Arizona can be combined into one entry Manchinema both to save time and because it sounds like an obscure disease. “I’m afraid you have Manchinema” says the doctor looking grave “and it is eating away the lining of your small intestine.”

Manchinema were seemingly grown in a lab to cause the most mental anguish possible to America’s progressives. They both adore the filibuster which makes the anti-democratic Senate even less democratic. Why do they feel this way? Because they say they love democracy. It’s like supporting Mohammed bin Salman because you love Jamal Khashoggi.

2. Joe Biden

Biden would be on this list no matter what because he is president of the United States. All presidents are ex officio members of any group of terrible Americans.

But Biden has also worked hard to earn his place here. “With Donald Trump out of the White House” Biden predicted back in 2019 “you will see an epiphany occur among many of my Republican friends.” Biden appears to still believe this even as his Republicans friends openly plot to kill and eat him.

Probably Biden’s worst action has been to help establish a kind of global vaccine apartheid under which (according to a recent estimate) rich countries have vaccinated 65 percent of their population against Covid-19 while poor countries have only been able to vaccinate 3 percent.

This has the twin virtues of being both mind-numbingly cruel and unbelievably stupid. The omicron variant is the fruit of leaving huge swaths of humanity unvaccinated and available to host mutations. Omicron may turn out knock on wood to be less deadly than previous variants. But until most everyone on the planet has lasting immunity to Covid-19 we will continue to be rolling the dice over and over and over again.

On the other hand this policy does have some enormous upsides such as [INAUDIBLE].

3. Elon Musk

It’s easy to criticize Elon Musk America’s wealthiest man so let’s do it. He’s engaged in union busting built a gigantic fortune on government subsidies and government research made preposterous predictions about the self-driving capacity of Tesla cars and potentially undermined the safety of Tesla owners and those around them.

But let’s concentrate here on his more picayune claims. Musk has said that he was “selling almost all physical possessions” and living in a $50000 home in Texas rented from his company SpaceX. But according to the Wall Street Journal Musk has in fact also been living in a billionaire friend’s 8000-foot Austin home. The Journal additionally found that Musk has been shopping for his own Austin-area mansion. The ultra-powerful often engage in this kind of peculiar self-mythologizing; Kim Jong Il was not satisfied with merely being dictator of North Korea — he also had to tell the world he shot a 38-under round of golf and was born under a double rainbow.

Finally let’s not forget Musk’s gravest crime: violating a core commandment of the Church of the SubGenius which is “Don’t Try to Be Funny If You’re Not.”

Oh yeah Klip Einstein pseudojournalist & douche-about-town — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 3 2020

4. Jonathan F. Mitchell

Former Texas Solicitor General Jonathan Mitchell crafted the legal concept behind Texas’s S.B. 8 law which bans abortion after as early as six weeks from conception. The Supreme Court has ruled that governments can’t interfere with a woman’s right to obtain an abortion before fetal viability so under normal circumstances Texas officials would be sued and the law would be thrown out. But Mitchell came up with the idea of making S.B. 8 only enforceable by private citizens granting them the right to sue into penury anyone who “aids or abets the performance or inducement of an abortion.”

Needless to say this is completely bonkers. If it endures it will literally be the end of constitutional rights in the United States. States can just hand individual citizens the ability to punish anyone engaging in constitutionally protected activities and that’s that.

Societies can’t survive if lawyers are continually trying to find preposterous loopholes in everything. Yes I signed a contract to pay you $300000 for your house but my lawyer figured out that it never specified they had to be American dollars. So here are 300000 Jamaican dollars worth about $2000 in U.S. currency. Now get out.

Mitchell’s bad faith is the kind of thing that makes people give a standing ovation to the famous line from “Henry VI” “Let’s kill all the lawyers.” We don’t need to go that far but we definitely have to kill Mitchell’s pernicious sophistry.

5. Rupert Murdoch

Murdoch has been around so long — he’s about to turn 91 — that it’s easy to forget what an extraordinarily bad person he is. He’s generated a cult that now comprises perhaps 25 percent of Americans who are lost in a fantasy world in which there are no such things as global warming evolution or any trustworthy figures outside the cult. Most shockingly he’s sent out his minions like Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson to discourage the cult from getting vaccinations for Covid-19. It’s like the People’s Temple in Guyana except Jim Jones doesn’t kill himself but — after everyone else has drunk the Flavor Aid — jumps on a helicopter shouts “So long suckers!” and flies away.

6. Donald Trump

There’s no need to enumerate the downsides of Trump. Everyone is capable of doing that themselves.

7. You

You were Time Person of the Year in 2006 but don’t let that go to your head; Hitler and Stalin received that honor too. For 2021 in particular we’re all condemning you for having a body that can turn into a virus factory at any moment. Even in normal times there are an estimated 380 trillion viruses living on and in you. This is obviously too many; please get your act together.

8. Covid-19 Profiteers

The pandemic has turned nine pharma executives and investors into billionaires. They now have a combined wealth of almost $20 billion. But there’s more: Eight other pharma investors who were already billionaires pre-Covid have increased their wealth by another $32 billion.

This has only been possible thanks to a massive government intervention in the market via monopoly patent protection — for vaccines that were largely developed via government funding. In other words regular people have paid for this on both ends. We haven’t checked but surely America’s free market champions are out in force condemning this.

9. Stephen Breyer

Remember when Ruth Bader Ginsberg was diagnosed with both colon cancer and pancreatic cancer but refused to retire during Barack Obama’s presidency? What a girlboss! Then she died while Trump was president cementing control of the Supreme Court to the ultra-right for the next 30 years.

Stephen Breyer has seen this example right in front of him and apparently decided to emulate it. Breyer now 83 years old is one of the three remaining justices appointed by a Democratic president. At any moment a Democratic senator could die plausibly handing control of the chamber to the GOP and eliminating any opportunity for Biden to replace Breyer. But Breyer is going to take his time planning to retire sometime between now and 2056. It’s all very exciting as long as your primary concern is Breyer’s ego and not whether American democracy is obliterated.

10. My Secret Enemy

I would like to identify my secret enemy but then they wouldn’t be secret. Also everyone who wasn’t my secret enemy would feel they were off the hook and be tempted to misbehave. Please try to stay on the straight and narrow so you are not unmasked and identified in the coming list of all the worst people of 2022. (Note that it is plausible that my secret enemy is me.)",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vSW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC9tZWx0aW5nLWFyY3RpYy1pY2UtY2F0YXN0cm9waGljLWVmZmVjdHMtd29ybGQtZXhwZXJ0cy9zdG9yeT9pZD04MTU4ODMzM9IBcGh0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vYW1wL0ludGVybmF0aW9uYWwvbWVsdGluZy1hcmN0aWMtaWNlLWNhdGFzdHJvcGhpYy1lZmZlY3RzLXdvcmxkLWV4cGVydHMvc3Rvcnk_aWQ9ODE1ODgzMzM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Melting Arctic ice will have catastrophic effects on the world experts say. Here's how.,"The Arctic is the ""frontline"" for climate change scientists said.

Melting Arctic ice will have catastrophic effects on the world experts say. Here's how.

If there is any doubt about climate change look no further than the coldest regions of the planet for proof that the planet is warming at unprecedented rates experts say.

The Arctic is heating up twice as fast as the rest of the world according to this year's Arctic Report Card released last week by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The phenomenon known as Arctic amplification occurs when the sea ice which is white thins or disappears allowing dark ocean or land surfaces to absorb more heat from the sun and release that energy back into the atmosphere.

Widely considered by polar scientists as Earth's refrigerator due to its role in regulating global temperatures the mass melting of sea ice permafrost and ice caps in the Arctic is hard evidence of global warming according to experts.

""The Arctic is the frontline for climate change"" climate scientist Jessica Moerman vice president of science and policy at the Evangelical Environmental Network a faith-based environmental group told ABC News. ""We should be paying careful attention to what is happening in the Arctic. It may seem like it's far away but the impacts come knocking on our front door.""

Here is how melting in the Arctic could have detrimental effects around the globe according to experts:

Coastal communities will eventually need to move inland

The biggest long-term effect of warming in the Arctic will be sea level rise Oscar Schofield a professor of biological oceanography at Rutgers University told ABC News.

Melting from he Arctic -- and the Greenland ice sheet in particular -- is the largest contributor to sea level rise in the world. Although the contribution from the Greenland ice sheet is less than a millimeter per year of rising sea level those small increments add up to between 6 inches to a foot since the Industrial Revolution -- sea levels that infrastructure near oceans was not built to withstand Schofield said.

A bit ""counterintuitively"" the loss from the Greenland ice sheet will have its greatest impact on places far away from the Arctic in low latitudes such as South America due to changes in the global ocean currents Twila Moon an Arctic scientist with the National Snow and Ice Data Center and one of the authors of the Arctic Report Card told ABC News.

Sea level rise from melting and continued climate change will exacerbate coastal erosion flood areas that had previously never seen flooding and even increase inland flooding as the salty ocean waters change groundwater tables and inundate freshwater resources Moon said.

""If you look at where humanity lives a great proportion of humanity lives right at the coastlines around the world"" he said. ""And if you look at where most of the big mega cities are they're right along coastlines: New York Los Angeles San Francisco.""

Global weather systems will shift drastically

The environmental conditions in the Arctic affect weather systems across the world. The North and South poles act as the ""freezers of the global system"" helping to circulate ocean waters around the planet in a way that helps to maintain the climates felt on land Moon said.

""What happens in the Arctic doesn't stay in the Arctic"" Moerman said.

The jet stream a band of strong winds moving west to east created by cold air meeting warmer air helps to regulate weather around the globe. In the continental U.S. the jet stream forms where generally colder and drier Arctic air meets warmer and more humid air from the Gulf.

But as temperatures in the Arctic warm the jet stream which is fueled by the temperature differences weakens Moerman said. Rather than a steady stream of winds the jet stream has become more ""wavy"" allowing very warm temperatures to extend usually far into the Arctic and very cold temperatures further south than usual Moon said.

""These cold air outbreaks are really severe"" Moerman said.

The variability in the climate in the Arctic specifically the weakening of the polar vortex which keeps cold air closer to the poles likely led to the Texas freeze in February that led to millions without power and hundreds of deaths a study published in Science in September found.

The study cited an ""increasingly frequent number of episodes of extremely cold winter weather over the past four decades"" in the U.S. despite temperatures rising overall.

Icebergs and the edge of the ice sheet are seen at the west coast close to Tasiilaq Greenland Sept. 17 2021. Hannibal Hanschke/Reuters FILE

Scientists are also looking into whether the phenomenon of atmospheric blocking is potentially linked with extreme summer or winter weather that occurs when the jet stream ebbs and causes weather patterns to stagnate over a period of time Moon said.

That stagnation was likely the cause of the extreme flooding that occurred in 2017 in Houston when the system from Hurricane Harvey remained over the region for days dumping more than 50 inches of rain and the multiple heatwaves that blanketed much of the Pacific Northwest this past summer Moerman added.

""These have real-world impacts whenever extreme cold air leaks out of the Arctic because of that weakening polar vortex"" Moerman said. ""And it goes into areas that are not prepared for that extreme weather.""

However despite the existing evidence more research needs to be done to further establish the link between the weakening polar vortex and extreme weather Moerman said.

Shipping lanes will open

Melting sea ice in the Arctic is opening up lanes in the ocean for the global trade route -- lanes that were previously blocked.

In the near future the melting will have a big impacts on major shipping laws Schofield said.

""They're no longer going to be sending ships all the way down to the Panama Canal"" he said. ""They're going to go directly through the Arctic. And so it's going to change commerce and have very large economic impacts.""

But access has the potential to become a ""hotbed for new conflict"" as nations fight for control over the newly emerged routes Moerman said.

""There's a lot of effort by countries to really try to claim as much territory as they can right now because there's likely going to be a huge host of economic incentives to go to this new area and harvest what you can"" Schofield said.

Some national security implications could occur as a result of the warming as well as ice melts and opens up previously blocked landmasses Moerman added. The U.S. Department of Defense will likely need to restructure its defense profile in the Arctic when there is no longer an ice cap for much of the year Schofield said.

The pristine ecosystem will likely be ruined

As the woes from a stalled supply chain continue the ability for shipping containers to utilize more routes in the absence of ice could appear to be beneficial for the world economy.

But it would spell disaster for the regional environment.

Right now the ecosystem in the Arctic is pristine and untouched and there are several unique species and ecosystems that have acclimated to the presence of ice Schofield said.

But as more ships come in and out of the region the chances that large-scale environmental degradation will occur is high Moerman said.

""We're definitely seeing changes in animal populations"" Moon said. ""Certainly animals that depend on sea ice as a primary habitat as we've lost the vast majority of our thicker sea ice.""

The ""poster child"" for the effects of the loss of sea ice on species is the polar bear Schofield said. Polar bear populations have dwindled so low and the habitats have become so fragmented that the animals are inbreeding which could have disastrous effects on the survival of the species within generations.

In Alaska the number of beaver ponds has doubled since 2000 likely due to the warming trend that has resulted in widespread greening in what was previously tundra the Arctic Report Card found. The rapid acidification of the warming ocean waters is likely affecting the marine food chain Moon said. And the increased marine traffic for both fishing and shipping is also likely affecting stress levels and behavior of species including how they communicate Moon added.

In addition to an increased chance of oil spills from increased commercial activity is the possibility of new oil and gas fields opening up in Russian territory could further amplify global warming as those natural gases are extracted Moerman said.

""The question is is can we get those policies and strategies set up now before there's this massive sort of gold rush on the Arctic Ocean?"" Schofield said.

Melting permafrost in the Arctic also poses natural environmental risks Moon said. The majority of the ground in the Arctic is frozen and as it thaws microbes and other living organisms within the organic carbon in the permafrost begin to wake up releasing carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere.

Temperatures need to be below 0 degrees Celsius to grow and maintain ice Schofield said. But we will likely never regain that ice as it took thousands of years of snow layers accumulating on top of each other to create the massive ice sheet which is several miles thick.

""At some point we're likely to cross the line where you know there'll be almost no winter to speak up"" Schofield said. ""And we see these kinds of effects in these polar regions like the Arctic and the Antarctic.""",,,,,,,,,

Most historic buildings in Minnesota were built decades after the area had already become a state. But one structure has remained standing for two centuries since the earliest days of white settlement in the region.

Ellen Orzoff of Bloomington sought answers about the state's oldest surviving building from Curious Minnesota the Star Tribune's reader-powered reporting project. Curious Minnesota podcast listeners voted it among their favorite questions submitted at the State Fair.

""I'm just very much into architecture and historical monuments"" said Orzoff a 17-year-old student.

The state's oldest building is a located at ""perhaps the most significant landmark in the entire history of Minnesota"" Russell W. Fridley then director of the Minnesota Historical Society wrote in 1956.

The Round Tower center at the Fort Snelling Historic Site.

That landmark is Fort Snelling. The earliest surviving structure at the fort known as the Round Tower was built in 1820. Originally a defensive structure the tower served many roles over its history — including a stint as a hair salon. And it also played a role in one of the most significant U.S. Supreme Court cases in American history.

The U.S. Army built Fort Snelling (initially called Fort St. Anthony) to defend against the British with whom the United States had recently been at war said Kevin Maijala the historical society's senior director of learning initiatives.

It was erected at a sacred site for the Dakota at the confluence of the Minnesota and Mississippi rivers known as Bdote. The Dakota origin story states that the tribe's first man and woman were created there. The United States took control of the land in a controversial 1805 agreement between military officer Zebulon Pike and local tribal members.

This 1823 map illustrates the boundaries of Fort Snelling then called Fort St. Anthony. The Round Tower is on the left-hand side.

The tower had limestone walls more than 25 feet high with musket slits that faced both outside and inside the fort so guns could point toward an enemy inside and outside the fort's walls. But the fort was never attacked according to MNopedia the historical society's online encyclopedia about Minnesota.

""Really Fort Snelling was established in the 1820s as a way for Americans to exert control over the fur trade"" Maijala said. Fur was a lucrative business at the time and the fort was built at the confluence of two rivers that Maijala dubbed ""the highways of that period.""

Troops at the fort — numbering as high as 500 at times — were also responsible for enforcing boundaries between Dakota and Ojibwe land as well as keeping European American immigrants from settling on Native American land according to Maijala.

""Sometimes early settlers came to the region before settlement was really allowed"" Maijala said.

Slavery was illegal in the area but between 15 and 30 enslaved people lived at the fort during the 1820s and 1830s — held by army officers government officials and fur traders.

Notable among them were Dred Scott and his wife Harriet who were married in the Round Tower in 1837. Scott would later sue for his freedom based on his time living at the fort and in Illinois which were free jurisdictions spurring a Supreme Court case that is considered an impetus of the U.S. Civil War.

Minnesota became a territory in 1849 and two 1851 treaties opened the area to settlement Maijala said.

The Round Tower in 1863.

During the Civil War the fort was reactivated as a place for training troops. ""About 25000 Minnesotans who fought in Minnesota units during the Civil War trained there"" he said. In 1862 the fort was a launching point for soldiers sent to fight in the U.S. war against the Dakota. Many Native people were subsequently imprisoned near the facility.

The tower required restoration after being damaged by fire in 1869. In the late 19th century the Army used the tower for various purposes including a washhouse a prison room and a coal storage room according to MNopedia.

The original stone walls of the tower were covered with a coat of cement as part of a rehab project at the fort in 1904 — prompting a backlash. ""Newspapers of the northwest took up the cry that the old fort's appearance should not be disturbed"" the Minneapolis Journal reported in 1905. The U.S. War Department ultimately ordered the coating be removed.

The Round Tower in 1904 after it was covered in a coat of cement.

After World War I the tower became home to an electrician and his wife who ran a hair salon in the building.

""It's kind of a weird building to have a hair salon in but it really is a pretty amazing adaptive reuse story"" Maijala said.

In 1941 the Minnesota Historical Society with assistance from the Works Progress Administration turned the tower into a museum. The interior walls featured a cyclorama a round mural that depicted scenes of American occupation in the region. The museum closed in 1946 and the tower was not in use for a couple of decades Maijala said.

In 1956 the Minnesota Highway Department proposed building a highway through a part of the old fort site that would have cut off access to the tower. Amid public opposition the department backed down and rerouted the highway.

The entrance to the Round Tower in 1954. The sign above the door states it is the oldest building in Minnesota.

In the mid-1960s a team of archaeologists excavated around the tower and restored it to its 1820s appearance. The fort was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1969 and has since served as a historic site operated by the Minnesota Historical Society.

While the Round Tower is the state's oldest building the oldest residence is the 1836 Henry Sibley House — located several miles away in Mendota. Sibley was the regional manager of the American Fur Company and the state's first governor. It is also maintained by the Historical Society.

The oldest structures constructed by humans in the state are Native American burial mounds. Some of the mounds such as those at the Grand Mound Historic Site in northern Minnesota are about 2000 years old.

When global pharma majors like Glaxo Smith Kline Bristol Myers Squibb Amgen or Baxter need a reliable partner to co-innovate today they turn to Syngene.

Jonathan Hunt MD & CEO of Syngene spoke to BusinessLine on what sets the company apart in the competitive CRAMS space and the road ahead. Excerpts:

Recently Amgen renewed its research collaboration contract for five more years. You seem to have sticky customers who work with you for longer periods instead of the traditional industry norm. What is different?

That is because of our business model. What we do including how we operate doesn’t have a lot of precedents in India. Some tend to look at us as just another derivative of the Indian generics industry but we are not. We are a services business focussed on science and innovation.

Inside our campus is the mindset is that we are a People’s Republic of the United States FDA (Food & Drug Administration). We operate in a highly regulated industry that has controls checks and balances apart from governance and rigour. We operate to a single standard of global science driven by excellence and a high compliance regulatory mindset. Whether it’s the US FDA European or Indian regulators we meet and exceed their standards every day. It is one of the things that reassures our global clients.

We don’t do much with Indian partners because the Indian life sciences industry is not yet fully focused on innovation. Our global partners range from companies in Australia to Japan Europe and of course North America. What they’re looking for is intellectual collaboration and added value.

Twenty years ago one would come to a company like Syngene for something scientifically simple but done well. However today they’re coming to Syngene because we can intellectually match their thoughts and innovation debate with them add value collaborate and drive science along with them.

Haven’t CRAMS or even CDMO (contract diagnostic and manufacturing) services been offered earlier by a number of players including the likes of Divi’s and Cadila?

Not really. Unfortunately the nomenclature doesn’t help. It’s like alphabet spaghetti in some ways with CRAM’s CDMO or R&D discovery services.

Our focus as a company is more towards the research innovation piece the front end. So think of us predominantly as scientists in labs doing innovative experiments. If you look at some of the companies you mentioned for instance Divi’s I think they’re a really good company. However they are downstream of that into the manufacturing. And they do that well but it is different from innovating up the value chain. So we’re a little bit further upstream.

Predominantly where we overlap is manufacturing. If you look over recent years some capital investments and expansion that we’ve put in place has gone into increasing our development organisation. We run on four different divisions — Discovery Services the traditional heartland and by value and volume the biggest today; Dedicated Centres a specialised form of discovery research for the likes of Amgen; Development Services the scientists in the lab working out formulations and processes; and Manufacturing where we work out how you do things at scale.

Divi’s for example is particularly strong at manufacturing. In the pharma industry the average timeline from having an idea to getting a product to the market would be 10 to 12 years. We do a lot of work in years 1/2/3 even into year 4. Some of the organisations that you describe are more active in years 7/8/9/10.

Does such co-innovating reflect in your margins?

On a global basis across our Chinese European Indian or other competitors our margin structure is above average and often upper quartile. It might vary slightly depending on what we’re doing on the capex side. We’ve been a high-growth business for a decade or more and we’re constantly scaling and growing. So some margins are compressed by that sort of investment.

The more you are seen as a scientific equal and a source of good ideas and problem-solving solutions the stickier clients are and longer the contracts will be. We’ve created a culture a workforce and a set of processes that add value and we want to ring-fence and protect it. So we have worked on becoming a platform for integrative drug discovery that allows us to sit not just with big clients but with players of all sizes. Today we count among our clients eight of the top 10 and 18 of the top 25 biopharma companies in the world.

We offer a good fit for innovative start-up biotechs. We are (nearly) a 30-year-old company of real scale breadth depth and experience who they can collaborate with. Because they’re small organisations they don’t have masses of departments to manage contracts relationships and outsourcing. They want to meet as scientific collaborators and for us to really contribute to their growth.

You have more than 400 clients. Beyond the pharma sector what other segments are witnessing growth?

The animal health segment is growing well. Six of the top 10 animal health companies have their antecedents in being divisions within pharma companies. We also have clients in the nutraceutical and cosmetics business. They are a good adjunct to our core business.. But actually the core business is human health whether it’s pharma or biotech mega-cap corporations or innovative start-ups.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm15aGVhbHRoeWNsaWNrLmNvbS9mZGEtYXBwcm92ZXMtdGV6c3BpcmUtdGV6ZXBlbHVtYWItZWtrby1mb3ItcGVvcGxlLXdpdGgtc2V2ZXJlLWFzdGhtYS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,FDA Approves Tezspire (Tezepelumab-Ekko) For People with Severe Asthma – Myhealthyclick.com,"Here’s some good news for people with severe asthma.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Tezspire (tezepelumab-ekko) an injectable drug that helps control severe asthma according to Drugs.com.

The drug developed by AstraZeneca and Amgen would be given once every four weeks under the supervision of a medical professional.

Tezspire is considered an add-on treatment meant to control severe asthma in people who fail to respond to current medications. Those who are advised the drug would continue to use other asthma treatments.

Tezspire is a unique drug because it is not limited to a specific type of severe asthma. It has been found to target only one type of molecule involved in airway inflammation.

Pulmonologist Dr. Len Horovitz of Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City said “There are several monoclonal antibody treatments for asthma mediated by eosinophils. Tezspire attacks a different molecule so acts on a different pathway. It may have utility in a wide variety of asthmatics.”

The FDA’s approval is based on the findings of two clinical trials that demonstrated the drug was safe and effective in controlling severe asthma.

In the trials participants received either Tezspire or the placebo every four weeks for a year. It was found that people who used the drug had fewer asthma attacks including fewer attacks that led to ER visits and/or hospitalization.

It is important to note that patients who are prescribed Tezspire should not stop using their inhaled or systemic corticosteroid asthma treatments. The FDA said “Any reductions should be gradual and under the direct supervision of a health care professional.”

The agency also said that people with preexisting helminth (parasitic) infections should be treated before starting Tezspire. Those who start taking this drug should not have live vaccines including measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) smallpox and rotavirus vaccines.

Tezspire should not be used to treat short-term asthma symptoms or attacks.

In the United States about 5% to 10% of people with asthma have severe asthma – a respiratory disease that affects the airways in the lungs.

In asthma the airways become swollen or inflamed due to certain triggers such as allergens irritants dust or viral infections. Symptoms of asthma include breathlessness wheezing coughing and chest tightness. A severe attack of asthma could be intense and life-threatening.",,,,,,,,,

Land Rover Defender downgraded

Aussie buyers asked to accept lower-specified SUVs or cancel order due to semi-conductor crisis

Australian buyers who have ordered a new Land Rover Defender are being asked to accept a downgraded version of the model they intended to purchase due to the ongoing global semi-conductor shortage that has severely disrupted car manufacturing worldwide. Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) Australia managing director Mark Cameron flagged earlier this year that such a move might be necessary due to the combined effects of the microchip shortage and orders flooding in from global markets that are recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic. This has made it difficult for the Australian operation to secure enough supply leading to long waiting times for owners and the likelihood that the high content of semi-conductors in the new Land Rover Defender – both the 110 and the short-wheelbase 90 – would require certain features to be removed.

One local buyer who ordered a Land Rover Defender 110 recently received an email from the car-maker saying that “certain options and standard features that were previously available have been removed from production until further notice”. As a result the vehicle in question which was said to have been “in the final stages of build” has had its 12.3-inch interactive driver display (digital instrument panel) replaced with a regular cluster with analogue dials and a TFT display. That means a smaller 7.0-inch screen no ability to hide the dials from view or configurate the instrument panel to provide a more personalised layout. Matrix LED headlights also specified on the customer’s car were replaced with less sophisticated but still “premium” LED headlights that include high beam assist.

How would you characterise the health of the captive insurance market in Bermuda?

If you ask a panel of captive insurance experts for their views on the industry in Bermuda you are likely to get different responses. But when they come together a clearer picture emerges.

Half a dozen Bermuda captive industry experts were polled by Bermuda Finance 2021/2022 Magazine.

These are a couple of the magazine’s questions and the answers provided by the panel.

The six industry experts are Paul Bailie head of offshore Americas Insurance Management Willis Towers Watson; Matt Carr partner Appleby; David Gibbons partner PwC Bermuda; Séadna Kirwan risk advisory director Aon; Michael Parrish senior vice-president and client services leader Marsh; and Brian Quinn chief executive officer Granite Management.

They were asked how they would characterise the health of the captives market in Bermuda.

Brian Quinn: “Granite Management is a small independent captive manager but our real focus is employee benefit consulting.

“We’ve seen a big uptick in interest in bringing employee benefits into captives over the past 18 months to the point where we’ve nearly doubled the amount of premium under management for our captive insurance clients.”

Michael Parrish: “I’m head of the client service group for Marsh Bermuda across captives commercials long-term sector and ILS. We have been very busy both with existing clients increasing the use of captives and with new business.

“We’ve added four new captives this year. There’s a lot of interest but that doesn’t always translate into new captives. But there’s certainly a lot more being done by captives already here. The market is good it’s busy. Bermuda is still doing well. The BMA has been very responsive through the pandemic.

“I don’t think the island has really suffered too much in this segment. Obviously there’s a bit of economic uncertainty on the island generally but that relates more to hospitality not so much international business which is very strong. It’s business as usual. I don’t think there’s been too much change.”

Paul Bailie: “Things are pretty busy at the moment. The wider commercial insurance markets have been difficult with rates increasing and we’re seeing increased activity in the captives segment as a result. In particular some of our existing clients are doing more than they were say two years ago but we are seeing new captives as well.”

What are the forces driving new formations?

Paul Bailie: “In terms of people coming to Bermuda I’m not sure the dynamics have changed massively. Our regulatory environment remains the attraction. We’re still a good home for larger more complex captives. In terms of the expertise on the island we’re probably ahead of some of our competitors.

“The bigger more complex accounts that want international programmes tend to come here. Perhaps companies that write purely domestic business in the US are more onshore now and there’s a lot of competition for that type of business.

“But we are still seeing growth in the complex and the global and in areas that are maybe a little newer where people are doing more innovative things for example around climate change and cyber as well as lines where there have been perennial challenges such as directors and officers liability.

“Hard market conditions in the wider markets have probably driven interest and people are being a little more aggressive about how they approach the particular barriers to form a captive programme. The numbers of start-ups isn’t massively overwhelming but we are also seeing segregated account companies – cells. That’s definitely an area where there is growth driven by hard market conditions.

“Some companies are taking a more holistic view to their use of capital to help them better manage capital and risk financing. Perhaps previously they have not used their captive as extensively as they might.”

Michael Parrish: “There are clear challenges in market conditions. Marsh Global Placement gives a summary of the growth in composite insurance pricing quarter on quarter. Interestingly it looks like increases in rates peaked in quarter four 2020 at 22 per cent.

“Throughout all of 2020 it rose 14 per cent 19 per cent 20 per cent and 22 per cent respectively. This year prices increased in the first quarter 18 per cent and in the second quarter 15 per cent.

“So while prices are still going up and the market is still very challenging it does look like the peak of the market was last year and that it’s starting to stabilise. These are averages across all lines. In certain cases such as cyber and D&O and professional lines the increases would have been vastly more.

“It is clear there are certain lines of business which have been very challenging for buyers and in those cases they tend to look at captives.

“The number of captives managing cyber-risk in some form increased 54 per cent over the same period. Medical stop-loss increased 81 per cent.

“These are risks captives really weren’t involved in a decade ago. There are a lot of new programmes being written by captives as a result of challenging market conditions. When the commercial market is difficult expensive companies will look at alternatives and the most common alternative is a captive.

“The gross written premium in captives under our management went up in 2020. Again that occurs as the market hardens as the market becomes more challenging. That is evidence that market conditions impact captive growth not necessarily in terms of new formations but certainly in terms of the increased usage of captives.”

Séadna Kirwan: “The hard market definitely prompted a broader look at what captives could be used for; in a number of cases they had no choice. The mindset within organisations was when the market was very soft some felt that they never chased rates right to the very bottom and they had some loyalty to their carriers. But they didn’t feel that loyalty was rewarded when the hard market came.

“In some cases the long-term relationships that they have historically had with carriers have been severely and potentially irreparably damaged.

“They are looking into the captive now thinking we actually have control of this over the long term. It’s a much more holistic strategic look at the captive trying to remove that reliance on the external market so that they don’t have to follow those peaks and troughs.

“People are setting budgets for the next 12 months and getting a 20 per cent premium next June that’s not in their budget is very hard to manage.

“That is changing the underlying behaviour of captive owners and of the large corporates utilising them.”

MattCarr: “We hear from our clients that they’re expecting to see some continued hardening of rates for the foreseeable future.

“That may be a driver for continued activity in the Bermuda captive insurance market and we are seeing further conversations and discussions many around emerging risk areas for example digital asset risks and cyber.

“These are exciting discussions for us as practitioners but also for Bermuda as a leading captive insurance domicile.”

Brian Quinn: “Our main focus is on employee benefits outsourced underwriting and management for captives in multiple domiciles including Bermuda and we have doubled our premium under management in the last year.

“A lot of the reasons for the increased interest in captives have been covered already but once companies start assessing they are looking at how to use their captives in other ways because they’ve been forced to reconsider their captive strategy due to the hardening market.

“I have many discussions with clients and potential clients asking me about using their captive to cover multiple different risks. This is not our focus but there’s a lot of interest because the market has made them reconsider. I have seen a lot more interest in setting up captives but also using cell captives structures to facilitate easy access to a captive solution.

“There is obviously an appetite for new captives out there and people are expanding those captives. In the soft market we had for probably well over a decade people weren’t using their captives as efficiently as they should have and now they’re refocusing.

David Gibbons: “A lot of companies are more focused on risk than they have been before. The chief risk officer’s voice around the C-suite is being heard more. Therefore you find people looking at their captive and the best ways to utilise it to mitigate risk.

“It’s not only the pricing component it’s also the impact of culture and the way people are looking at risk now.

“Further as business environments and risks change supply chain management and business interruption are more of an issue in the new dynamic of the world.

“That is where we’re seeing a lot of discussion on how you can change what your captive is doing and cover not just the pricing and limits but the new way we’re working in this environment.”

Bahrain all set to launch first stage of health insurance for expats

TDT | Manama

The Daily Tribune – www.newsofbahrain.com

Bahrain is all set to boost ahead to a more advanced phase of its ambitious health care project designed to provide mandatory health insurance for expatriates in the Kingdom.

The project dubbed Mandatory Private Cooperative Health Insurance Programme (PCHIP) for Expatriates is nearing the launch of its first stage.

This development is as per a tender launched by the Supreme Council for Health seeking a supplier to “perform specific tasks” during the first stage. According to the tender board the tender attracted two companies.

Aon Bahrain quoted BHD 210000.000 and Marsh (Bahrain) Company quoted BHD 5287586.000 for taking up the work. A successful vendor SCH says should provide administrative and brokerage services for the first stage of the programme concerning mandatory health insurance for residents.

Tender Board however says that the company quoting the lowest amount may not necessarily award the tender as price becomes a principal concern only after fulfilling technical and other criteria set.

National Health Plan

As per Health Insurance Law No. 23 of 2018 health insurance is mandatory for all citizens residents and visitors. The decision is also part of the National Health Plan (2016- 2025) that paves the way forward for the health industry in Bahrain.

One of the main objectives of the Plan is the adoption of the Social Health Insurance Programme (SEHATI) to develop the quality of the current health system and ensure sustainability.

Sehati on way

Recent reports say that the National Health Insurance Programme Sehati will be implemented early next year by launching a self-management project at health centres and government hospitals on a trial basis. The scheme is expected to cover expatriates in the second quarter of next year and nationals early 2023.

How does autonomy for primary healthcare centres works?

Under the new system each individual will get paired with a family physician.

The family physician will provide therapeutic and preventative services: such as vaccinations and early detection of diseases such as cancer diabetes and others. If specialist care is needed the patient will get it through a secondary healthcare hospital.

Like a heat mirage shimmering over the road ahead Apple's much-awaited contribution to the electric car market has been teasing us from the horizon since rumours of its development first emerged back in late 2014.

Despite having the potential to be the California-based firm's biggest project yet both figuratively and literally precious little has been officially revealed about the plans for the Apple Car.

Nevertheless signs of development are abound from the firm's apparent ongoing tests of self-driving software around Cupertino via a fleet of sensor-laden Lexus SUVs to the filing of an assortment of suggestive patents.

Based on these experts have anticipated what the Apple Car could look like and the revolutionary features it might sport from a customisable touchscreen dashboard to a Siri-like 'intelligent automated assistant'.

Brought to life by artists with the UK car leasing firm Vanarama the gorgeous mock-up has the sleek minimalist lines that make Apple's tech offerings so distinctive down to the glowing Apple logo on the radiator grille.

Vanarama experts have anticipated what the Apple Car could look like (pictured) and the features it might sport — from a customisable touchscreen dashboard to a Siri-like 'intelligent automated assistant' — based on real-life patent filings

APPLE CAR TIMELINE While little is known about the development and progress of the Apple Car rumours have long abound: 2008 — Then-Apple CEO Steve Jobs first expresses an interest in an Apple Car in the wake of both the launch of the original iPhone and the release of Tesla Motor's first car according to iPod inventor Tony Fadell and Apple board member Mickey Drexler. 2014 — An electric car project codenamed 'Titan' is allegedly given the go-ahead by Apple CEO Tim Cook. 2015 — Apple is said to have hired new employees for the project alongside meeting with self-driving car experts and GoMentum Station a California-based testing ground for autonomous vehicles. The firm hires Daimler Trucks subsidiary Torc to fit sensors to two Lexus SUVs in a project known internally as 'Baja'. 2016 — Bloomberg reports that Apple has decided to switch its priority over to developing software to power self-driving solutions. However sources suggest that the firm is still looking to ultimately create a car of its own. 2017 — Tim Cook acknowledges that Apple is working on self-driving technologies. Rumours arise that the firm will be testing autonomous cars on California roads. 2018 — Apple registers 27 self-driving cars with California's Department of Motor Vehicles. The firm enters a rumoured partnership with Volkswagen to produce an autonomous electric shuttle bus. The FBI charge a former Apple employee for stealing trade secrets relating to project Titan. In August an Apple self-driving car is rear-ended during road testing. 2019 — Drive.ai an autonomous vehicle start-up is acquired by Apple. 2020 — Reuters reports that Apple is working towards a possible Apple Car launch in 2024. 2021 — Industry scuttlebutt has it that Apple is in talks with Hyundai and Kia to jointly produce self-driving electric cars but the vehicle manufacturers deny this. More rumours emerge of a 2024 launch goal — this time in collaboration with Toyota and its Korean partners. Advertisement

'Rumours of a car created by Apple started as early as 2014 and have gained momentum since' said Vanarama CEO Andy Alderson.

'It has become a big deal in the car industry and beyond and here at Vanarama we were eager to see what the Apple Car could look like.

'To give us an idea we searched for official patents filed by Apple itself and combined them with the design cues and aesthetics we've come to expect from the tech company. The result is our vision of the Apple car.

'Although there is virtually no way of knowing what the finished product will look like these patents are perhaps the best indication as to the direction Apple is taking.'

The stand-out patented concept that seems most likely to be realised in the Apple Car is a sleek touchscreen interface — one which Vanarama has imagined sweeping across the totality of the vehicle's dashboard.

According to the patent the interface will offer tactile feedback and will be both 'stylistically attractive' and fully 'customizable by the user'.

The 'Reconfigurable Tactile Control Display' as Apple has called it 'is also thought to be lower in cost than most conventional instrument panels and may have applications in other fields such as military vehicles control systems home automation systems CAD or Graphics terminals and the like.'

To match Apple's design sensibilities the mock-up car imagines the display without any clear edges or boundaries with Vanarama proposing that the dashboard might detect occupants' phones or smartwatches to load custom interface layouts suggest likely destinations via satnav-based maps and even pull up custom music playlists for the journey.

A number of other patents meanwhile hint at the potential for the Apple Car to have an unusual car body structure with no central door pillars and rear coach doors — such as seen on some Lincoln Continentals and the modern Rolls-Royce Ghost — allowing for easier passenger entry via a 'continuous opening'.

The vehicle's forward seating meanwhile is imagined as being able to swivel fully round to face the passengers in the rear of the car who in turn are separated by a sleek table-like divider.

This internal flexibility could facilitate a more social travelling experience when the car is in self-driving mode while still allowing the occupant of the driver's seat to turn around and retake control when required.

Alongside the expectations of an autonomous mode for the Apple Car another patent hints at a Siri-like 'intelligent automated assistant' that — alongside responding to direct commands and requests — would also be able to monitor the vehicle's environment and either react or offer recommendations to the driver accordingly.

Vanarama designed the radiator grill on the front of its mock-up to mirror the 'cheese grater' ventilation holes on the case of the Mac Pro workstations and servers.

The centre of the grill meanwhile is bedecked with a backlit Apple logo — as long adorned the lids of many MacBook models — a motif replicated on the steering column leather headrests rear lights and wheel hubs.

Vanarama's imagining of the Apple Car can be explored in 3D via a 'virtual product reveal' on its website.

The government had to intervene after the employees protested and complained about the poor quality of food at work and the hostels resulting in several workers getting admitted to different hospitals.

In 2020 Foxconn had pledged to invest over Rs 7000 crore in expanding facilities including to assemble premium products such as Apple’s iPhones.

The communication sent by the additional Chief Secretary in-charge of Industries S Krishnan and the additional director general of Police P Thamarai Kannan to the company management on December 23 listed out a number of suggestions including efforts required to improve the quality of employees’ rooms washrooms water and other basic amenities at the hostel. The communication also specified that the rooms of employees should be properly ventilated.

Obtaining necessary permission from the district collector for the employees’ hostels and taking steps to cook the food served to employees within the place of their accommodation were among the government’s suggestions.

It also advised the company to ensure granting of emergency leaves for employees when it is required and suggested an alternative arrangement to ensure the required strength of employees through a manpower agency when a section of employees goes on leave.

A government statement issued in this regard said Foxconn assured that it will urge their contractors to provide quality food for all 15000 employees working for the company and promised that they will expand their facility and operations providing employment for more people soon.

Meanwhile the government-run State Industries Promotion Corporation (SIPCOT) is building an integrated hostel complex at a cost of Rs 570 crore near Kanchipuram a region near Chennai city where most of the major industrial units are located. The government statement said the structure is being built on 20 acre of land area and will have eight blocks with 11 floors each. The government statement said the building project will be completed in 18 months and it will be able to accommodate as many as 18750 persons."

Ph.D. student Imran Deen and Professor Federico Rosei of the Institut National de la Recherche Scientifique (INRS) have been developing a coating that simulates bone tissue.

Traditional metal ceramic or polymer implants have limited bioactive properties. The healing process can be lengthy and have a higher risk of rejection. Developing a new generation of implant materials that promote compatibility and integration is crucial. Federico Rosei Professor INRS

Bioactive Materials

Using three bioactive materials the researchers have been developing an advanced coating. Chitosan which is found in shrimp shells exhibits antimicrobial properties. Cells migrate and grow more easily in the presence of collagen which is one of the organic components found in bones. Copper-doped phosphate glass induces the formation of blood vessels and the reconstruction of bones.

The ability to deposit such coatings allows for the potential to make implants with tailored biological properties. It holds promise for biomedical applications as these coatings can provide better implant-host interactions. Imran Deen Ph.D. Student INRS

Electrophoretic Deposition Method

To create the coating the researchers used electrophoretic deposition. The implant serves as an electrode onto which particles of bioactive material are deposited thereby forming a layer.

However this method does not affect the structure and properties of the bioactive materials. In contrast to other deposition methods used at present the new method can be applied to complex shapes at standard room temperature and pressure without costly equipment.

Deposition can also be easily tailored to specific applications as the new method is versatile. The technique can for instance be applied to chemically and biologically inert coatings antimicrobial and hydrophilic coatings or bone surface reconstructions. In addition to producing coronary or venous stents this product could also be used in bone transplants and medical environments to inhibit bacterial transmission. This would prevent biological infections.

It is now necessary to perform more studies to verify the proof of principle behind the new method specifically in biological terms. To use this kind of coating in clinical applications it is vital to measure cell proliferation at the coating surface and in vivo tissue adhesion.

Ltd.

Arthaland has also consolidated its interest in Cebu Lavana Land Corp. (CLLC) a subsidiary that owns two parcels of adjacent land in Cebu City where office property complex Cebu Exchange was built on.

Arthaland sold a 40-percent stake in Bhavana Properties Inc. and Bhavya Properties Inc. to Singapore-based Narra Investment Properties Pte. Ltd. which is managed by Arch Capital.

The investment agreements have been executed on Friday giving Narra two board seats each in the five-man boards of Bhavana and Bhavya. Arthaland retained ownership of 60 percent of both firms.

Bhavya was incorporated in 2019 as the investment vehicle of Arthaland to acquire First Capital Condominium located at 119 Rada Street Legaspi Village in Makati City with the objective of developing therein a high-end residential condominium.

Bhavana also incorporated in 2019 is the investment vehicle used by Arthaland to purchase a parcel of land with a total area of around 2245 square meters located in Corner Samar Loop Road and Ayala Hipodromo Cebu City which will be the site of its next project in the Visayas.

Arch Capital meanwhile is bowing out of CLLC.

Arthaland thus approved the acquisition of 40-percent additional shares in CLLC for P113.16 million. Arthaland also bought the rights title and interest accrued on shareholder advances for P762.34 million.

The seller was Rock and Salt B.V. a Netherlands-based foreign private limited liability company managed by Arch Capital.

The agreement was also signed and executed on Friday giving Arthaland 100-percent control of CLLC.

Gallagher's Recent Short Interest - Arthur J. Gallagher (NYSE:AJG),"Loading... Loading...

Arthur J. Gallagher's AJG short percent of float has risen 5.71% since its last report. The company recently reported that it has 2.11 million shares sold short which is 1.11% of all regular shares that are available for trading. Based on its trading volume it would take traders 2.65 days to cover their short positions on average.

Why Short Interest Matters

Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.

Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.

Gallagher (AJG) Ahead of Earnings?,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. AJG may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.

That is because Arthur J. Gallagher is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for AJG in this report.

In fact the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently higher than the broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.40 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for AJG giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.14% heading into earnings season.

Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. Price and EPS Surprise

Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. price-eps-surprise | Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. Quote

Why is this Important?

A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).

Given that AJG has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

Clearly recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Arthur J. Gallagher and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.

Les accusatrices avaient affirmé que le comédien hollywoodien avait abusé de son pouvoir pour répéter des scènes de nu contraintes. «Il faisait toujours ressentir à tout le monde qu'il pouvait y avoir des rôles en jeu si on était prêtes à jouer des actes sexuels ou à enlever notre haut» avait assuré une plaignante dans une enquête publiée en 2018 dans le «Los Angeles Times».

«Je n'aurais pas dû»

Cette semaine dix mois après que James Franco a signé un accord à plus de 2 millions de dollars avec deux de ses accusatrices Sarah Tither-Kaplan et Toni Gaal l'acteur de 43 ans a donné une interview à la radio démentant notamment avoir eu des relations contraintes avec des élèves inscrites à un cours intitulé «scènes de sexe» et assurant n'avoir eu que des relations sexuelles «consenties» avec certaines d'entre elles. «Ce n'était pas un plan machiavélique de ma part (...) mais oui il y a eu des cas où j'ai eu quelque chose de consenti avec des étudiantes et je n'aurais pas dû» a-t-il dit dans une sorte de «mea culpa». Pour sa défense James Franco a évoqué ses addictions aux drogues et à l'alcool lorsqu'il était adolescent estimant les avoir remplacées à l'âge adulte par une addiction au sexe et à sa propre célébrité. «Je suppose qu'à l'époque je pensais ""si c'est consenti c'est OK""» avait-il ajouté reconnaissant ensuite que «ce n'est probablement pas cool».

La nouvelle Constitution proposée par le président guinéen Alpha Condé a recueilli plus de 90% de ""oui"" lors du référendum du 22 mars boycotté par l'opposition qui y voit un stratagème du chef de l'Etat pour se maintenir au pouvoir a indiqué vendredi la commission électorale.

La proposition a recueilli 9159% de ""oui"" et 841% de ""non"" pour un taux de participation estimé à 61% a dit aux journalistes le président de la commission Amadou Salifou Kébé.

Le projet prêté au président Condé de briguer à 82 ans un troisième mandat fin 2020 et la nouvelle Constitution qui doit l'y aider selon l'opposition sont au coeur d'une crise politique qui a fait des dizaines de morts depuis mi-octobre.

Le référendum constitutionnel a lui-même été entaché de violences qui ont fait des dizaines de morts le jour de sa tenue dimanche dernier et les jours suivants à Conakry et en province selon l'opposition.

Un référendum et des victimes

Les autorités reconnaissent quelques morts tout en assurant que la consultation s'est déroulée sereinement.

Le mouvement d’Eric Zemmour Reconquête ! en Gironde a dénoncé vendredi dans un communiqué « la bassesse de la mairie de Bordeaux » assurant que mercredi matin « des agents (municipaux) ont pénétré dans la cathédrale (Saint-André) afin de le retirer ».

""C'est honteux et très bas d'instrumentaliser Noël pour servir la propagande électorale haineuse d'Eric Zemmour"" a réagi Laurent Guillemin l'adjoint au maire notamment en charge du culte. Contacté par l'AFP le diocèse de Bordeaux explique que le sapin a effectivement été retiré de l'entrée de la cathédrale mais d'un ""commun accord"" avec la municipalité après avoir compris que son installation quelques jours plus tôt sur la place Pey-Berland était le fait d'un ""groupe politisé"".

""On évite que des éléments très politisés soient présents dans des lieux de culte pour des raisons de neutralité"" a justifié l'abbé Samuel Volta vicaire général du diocèse.

Samedi dernier Génération Z le mouvement des jeunes partisans du candidat à l’élection présidentielle Eric Zemmour s’était vanté sur les réseaux sociaux de l’installation d’un sapin de Noël haut de 3 m sur la place de la cathédrale. Soit à quelques mètres du sapin de verre de la municipalité de Pierre Hurmic vertement critiqué il y a un an pour son refus d’installer « un arbre mort » à Noël. « L’idéologie écolo en péril face à l’éternité de nos traditions françaises » avait tweeté Génération Z.

Face à cette occupation « sans autorisation » la municipalité avait demandé que l’arbre soit déplacé. « Un groupe de jeunes a proposé au sacristain de le récupérer et ne sachant pas de qui il s’agissait il a accepté comme on accepte aussi des fleurs on reçoit souvent des dons » a relaté l’abbé Samuel Volta. Par la suite l’Église a « jugé bon de ne pas garder le sapin ». « Il nous semblait mieux de ne pas jeter de l’huile sur le feu » a souligné le vicaire qui ne souhaitait pas non plus voir l’arbre « gaspillé ».

As the cream of female film talent including Hollywood’s Meryl Streep and Britain’s Andrea Arnold prepare to receive significant career awards a dark cloud is threatening. It is expected that new allegations of the abuse of women in the European entertainment industry will be made public which may overshadow the sparkle of a feminist Croisette.

Streep’s screen achievements will be celebrated with an honorary Palme d’Or at the opening ceremony while a day later Arnold the acclaimed British film director will receive the prestigious Carosse d’Or from the French director’s guild. And on Sunday another influential British film personality will be saluted when diversity champion Dame Donna Langley the chairman and chief content officer at NBCUniversal is to be honoured with the Women in Motion Award at a lavish dinner. All this comes in a year that also sees the American director Greta Gerwig best known for last summer’s Barbie presiding over a jury that features the campaigning stars Eva Green and Lily Gladstone. But the story of the 77th festival will not be all positive for women.

In the run-up to the annual gathering on the Côte d’Azur rumours have been widespread in France of the existence of a secret list of 10 men in the industry including leading actors and directors who have been abusive to women. The names described as “explosive” are believed to have been sent anonymously to the National Centre for Cinema in Paris along with other leading film finance companies in France.

According to reports in Le Figaro and the satirical magazine Le Canard enchaîné festival organisers have set up a crisis management team to respond to the accusations. Films might have to be dropped from the screening timetable if they involve implicated names.

The impending revelations may prove an apt curtain-raiser for the Wednesday premiere of a short French film Moi Aussi about abuse in the industry. The film which was added to the festival’s Un Certain Regard programme at the last minute is predicted to prove just as incendiary as the list owing to its emotive content.

Made by actor Judith Godrèche dubbed the “ambassador of #MeToo” in France it draws on the words of many female contributors and takes the form of a choral piece uniting different personal accounts. “Suddenly before me was a crowd of victims a reality that also represented France so many stories from all social backgrounds and generations” Godrèche has explained. “Then the question was what I was going to do with them? What do you do when you’re overwhelmed by what you hear by the sheer volume of testimonies?”

The 52-year-old actor first shook up French cinema in February when she accused the directors Jacques Doillon and Benoît Jacquot of having raped her in the 1980s when she was a teenager. Jacquot 77 Godrèche said had a relationship with her when she was under the age of consent. He denies committing any offences and has said that he was “under her spell”. She claims Doillon 80 forced her to take part in a gratuitous sex scene on his 1989 film La Fille de 15 ans (The 15-year-old Girl). He says she agreed to take part in the scene in which he also acted and he denies rape or assault. Godrèche followed up her accusations a month later with a speech at France’s high-profile Cesar awards in which she claimed the film industry had been a cover for exploiting underaged actors.

The effect of new abuse allegations and all the honours being heaped on influential women will certainly mean the opening of the 2024 festival is in strong contrast to last year. Last May demonstrators on the Croisette opposed Johnny Depp’s appearance in the opening film Jeanne du Barry. They were angry about recent abuse allegations against him involving his ex-wife Amber Heard that led to his defeat in a British libel trial although a month later he won a similar libel trial in an American court.

A more progressive tone should be set by Streep’s opening honour made in recognition of “countless masterpieces” over 50 years of cinema. “To stand in the shadow of those who have previously been honoured is humbling and thrilling in equal part” said Streep on hearing of the award.

London-born Langley a “trailblazing” studio chief is also being rewarded next weekend for fostering “a more inclusive industry” over two decades with films that “provide a platform for women”. Away from film sets Langley has also campaigned as a board member of Vital Voices and is a founder of the Hollywood Reporter’s Women in Film mentorship programme. Previous winners of the Women In Motion award include Jane Fonda Salma Hayek Viola Davis and last year Michelle Yeoh.

Arnold whose new film Bird is showing in the main competition this year will receive her award after a Wednesday screening of her 2006 film Red Road. Set in Glasgow it tells of a false accusation of rape made vengefully by a female CCTV operator.

Jury-member Green is one of the more prominent actors to have accused Harvey Weinstein of making inappropriate advances. In 2017 the actor said she had to push away the disgraced producer during a business meeting in Paris. “I got away without it going further but the experience left me shocked and disgusted” she said.

The reaction to the #MeToo movement in France has been slower and more nuanced than in America. The legendary actor Catherine Deneuve was among those to initially play down the importance of prosecuting the bad behaviour of men defending their so-called “right to pester”. But last week French legislators agreed to a government inquiry into sexual and gender-based violence across the country’s performing arts and fashion sectors. And in the autumn French actor Gérard Depardieu stands trial on charges of sexually assaulting two women on the set of The Green Shutters. He faces rape charges in another case and is under investigation over allegations of assault. He denies all charges.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMTEvYXJ0cy9qZWFubmllLWVwcGVyLWRlYWQuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jeannie Epper Groundbreaking Stunt Double on ‘Wonder Woman’ Dies at 83,"Jeannie Epper had at least 100 screen roles maybe even 150 — no one is quite sure. But because she was a stunt double galloping on horseback crashing cars and kicking down doors for the stars of films and television shows hers was not a household name.

In her heyday however Ms. Epper was ubiquitous. She hurtled through the air most weeks as Lynda Carter’s stunt double on the hit television series “Wonder Woman” and mimed Ms. Carter’s leggy lope. She tumbled through a scrum of mud and rocks as Kathleen Turner’s double in the 1984 comedy-adventure film “Romancing the Stone” which also starred Michael Douglas. She threw punches for Linda Evans in one of her many ballyhooed cat fights with Joan Collins on the frothy long-running 1980s nighttime soap opera “Dynasty.”

And in what she often said was her favorite stunt — or gag to use the industry term — Ms. Epper skidded a Corvette into a 180-degree turn as Shirley MacLaine’s character in “Terms of Endearment” (1983) neatly hurling Jack Nicholson’s double into the Gulf of Mexico.

Ms. Epper whose bruising career spanned 70 years died on Sunday at her home in Simi Valley Calif. She was 83.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jby51ay9uZXdzL3dvcmxkLWF1c3RyYWxpYS02ODg3MTg2OdIBN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jby51ay9uZXdzL3dvcmxkLWF1c3RyYWxpYS02ODg3MTg2OS5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sydney's tree wars: Greed and harbour views fuel vandalism,According to the New South Wales Land and Environment Court 90 cases of unlawful clearing have been prosecuted in the state over the past five years.

Friday’s solar storm pushed the northern lights also known as the aurora borealis much further south than normal.

What are the northern lights and where are they usually seen?

The northern lights occur when gaseous particles in the Earth’s atmosphere collide with charged particles from the sun’s atmosphere.

In the northern hemisphere the lights are visible above the Earth’s geomagnetic North Pole. They’re usually more visible during the winter months when the nights are longer and the skies are less hazy according to National Weather Service website.

Why are they so far south?

An unusually strong solar storm hit Earth. The sun has produced strong solar flares since Wednesday resulting in at least seven outbursts of plasma. Each eruption — known as a coronal mass ejection — can contain billions of tons of plasma and magnetic field from the sun’s outer atmosphere or corona. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to issued a rare severe geomagnetic storm warning when a solar outburst reached Earth on Friday afternoon. The effects were due to last through the weekend and possibly into next week.

According to NOAA it’s all part of the solar activity that’s ramping up as the sun approaches the peak of its 11-year cycle.

Did the solar storm disrupt power and communications?

It caused what appeared to be only minor disruptions to the electric power grid communications and satellite positioning systems.

NOAA said the solar storm will persist throughout the weekend offering another chance for many to catch the Northern Lights on Saturday night.

How to see the northern lights? I’m in Texas.

It helps to have solid darkness a clear sky and of course location matters.

Will we be able to see them in Dallas Fort Worth or anywhere in Texas? According to NOAA it’s hard to predict who might get the visual treat. Some media outlets in the Houston area reported that folks there were able to see them overnight Friday. To capture them experts recommended taking a photo because cameras capture light better than the naked eye.

Experts also said it would not be the dramatic curtains of color normally associated with the northern lights but more like splashes of greenish hues.

The Miami office of the National Weather Service confirmed sightings in the Fort Lauderdale and Fort Myers Florida areas. Meteorologist Nick Carr said another forecaster who lives near Fort Lauderdale photographed the lights and was familiar with them because he previously lived in Alaska.

People in Kansas Nebraska Iowa Michigan Minnesota and other Midwestern states were able to capture photos of bright colors along the horizon.

This Christmas the coach and the team rode from Starkville to Memphis on a bus.

For that brief moment Saturday evening Leach thought back on a Christmas long ago when he was a fourth-grader growing up in Wyoming.

Leach was a fan of ""Daniel Boone"" a television series that aired for seven seasons until 1970 depicting the famous pioneer’s encounters with Native Americans. So that Christmas Leach received a Daniel Boone musket from Santa.

“Back then kids and dogs ran all over the neighborhood” Leach said. “It came in extremely handy when you went out in the backyard with your friends and played Daniel Boone.”

All these years later Leach still has a penchant for replica guns. He might not run around the neighborhood to play Daniel Boone any longer but the 60-year-old coach has long admired key figures from previous generations.

Leach and Buddy Levy wrote a book - “Geronimo: Leadership Strategies of an American Warrior” - that was released in 2014 following the life of the Apache leader.

So this Christmas amid all the preparations for facing Texas Tech (6-6) on Tuesday (5:45 p.m. ESPN) Leach unwrapped a replica of Geronimo’s .45 Colt rifle.

“I’m still debating whether to shoot it or not” Leach said. “They say you’re not supposed to shoot those commemorative ones but I haven’t ruled that one out yet.”

That will come after Mississippi State (7-5) plays at the Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium to close out the season.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Dec. 25 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Ball Aerospace is celebrating today's launch of NASA's James Webb Space Telescope (Webb) from French Guiana. The Colorado-based company designed and built the advanced optical technology and lightweight mirror system that will enable Webb to detect light from the first stars and galaxies.

Ball Aerospace designed and built the advanced optical technology and lightweight mirror system for NASA's James Webb Space Telescope that launched Dec. 25.

""It is truly an honor to be such an integral part of the next great space observatory"" said Dr. Makenzie Lystrup vice president and general manager Civil Space Ball Aerospace. ""Today's launch is the culmination of a lot of hard work by a closely integrated team that spanned across multiple mission partners and NASA. We are tremendously eager to see the science the new observatory captures.""

Announced as the Next Generation Space Telescope in 1996 and renamed James Webb Space Telescope in 2002 the space science observatory represents the largest and most complex ever built. Once on orbit Webb will capture faint light from the very first objects that illuminated the universe after the Big Bang.

To make this possible Ball Aerospace worked with NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center and Northrop Grumman the prime industry partner to innovate the 25 square-meter (~269 square feet) mirror system consisting of 18 beryllium mirror segments working together as one mirror. It will be the largest mirror and the first segmented telescope ever deployed in space operating at the extremely cold space temperature of -406⁰ F (30K) necessary for infrared imaging of distant stars and galaxies.

Ball also developed the cryogenic actuators mounted on each segment to control individual mirror positioning and curvature radius within one ten-thousandth the width of a human hair. To align the mirror segments Ball also designed the 22 electronic flight control boxes to operate in a deep-freeze space environment to individually control each of the 132 actuators that keep the telescope segments properly aligned on orbit.

To innovate validate and demonstrate technologies used to develop Webb's pioneering optical system Ball Aerospace drew on its in-depth experience with space hardware designed for all four of NASA's Great Observatories (Hubble Space Telescope Compton Gamma Ray Observatory Chandra X-Ray Observatory and Spitzer Space Telescope).

Ball is also playing critical roles in other upcoming space observation missions. It is partnering with Goddard to develop the Wide Field Instrument for the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope and providing the spacecraft bus and telescope for the Spectro-Photometer for the History of the Universe Epoch of Reionization and Ices Explorer (SPHEREx). Earlier this month the Ball-built Imaging X-Ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) launched from Kennedy Space Center on its mission to uncover the inner workings of some of the most exotic astronomical objects in our universe such as neutron stars and black holes.

Chase bank does in fact observe New Year's Day as a bank holiday and will be closed.

Bank of America and Wells Fargo both also respectively observe New Year's Day as bank holidays and will be closed.

Customers should expect most banks to be closed on federal holidays but always be sure to check your local bank's hours with them.

Are banks open on New Year's Eve?

Although New Year's Day is considered to be a federal holiday the same cannot be said for New Year's Eve.

New Year's Eve although widely celebrated is not listed as a federal holiday on the Federal Reserve's website.

Most banks like Chase Bank of America and Wells Fargo are likely to be open.

Disney Coca-Cola American Express Bank of America Lowe's and Pfizer faced accusations that they trained employees on certain ""woke"" ideas such as putting ""marginalized"" staff above ""privileged"" staff learning to ""decolonize"" their minds"" and combating aspects of an alleged ""White supremacy culture"" such as perfectionism individualism and objectivity.

These ideas trace back to critical race theory (CRT) — a framework that involves deconstructing aspects of society to discover systemic racism beneath the surface. Current and former employees at American Express told Fox News that the change began after the police-involved killing of George Floyd in May 2020 but the ""woke"" trainings came to light in 2021.

AMERICAN EXPRESS CRT TRAINING URGED STAFF TO ADOPT A HIERARCHY PUTTING ‘MARGINALIZED’ ABOVE ‘PRIVILEGED’

In February a whistleblower at Coca-Cola claimed that the company forced employees to take a seminar teaching them to ""be less white."" The whistleblower posted photos of a seminar giving tips to ""be less white"" including ""be less arrogant be less certain be less defensive be more humble listen believe break with apathy"" and ""break with white solidarity."" The materials claimed that White people in the United States and other western nations are ""socialized to feel that they are inherently superior because they are white.""

Yet Coca-Cola told Fox Business that the slides ""are not part of the company's learning curriculum.""

Coca-Cola President Alfredo Rivera apologized for the situation in March.

""Recently we learned that content accessible through our company training platform did not align with"" being ""respectful for all"" he said.

While this material was not part of the training curriculum Rivera said ""We apologize to those who were offended by this content. We would never encourage anyone to be any less of themselves.""

In March Manhattan Institute Senior Fellow Chris Rufo revealed whistleblower documents from the Walt Disney Company's diversity and inclusion program ""Reimagine Tomorrow."" The program includes multiple training modules on ""antiracism.""

The modules tell employees that they must ""take ownership of educating [themselves] about structural anti-Black racism."" The modules claim that the U.S. has a ""long history of systemic racism and transphobia"" and that White employees must ""work through feelings of guilt shame and defensiveness to understand what is beneath them and what needs to be healed."" Another module encourages employees to reject ""equality"" focusing on ""equal treatment and access to opportunities"" and instead strive for ""equity"" focusing on ""the equality of outcome.""

PFIZER SETS RACE-BASED HIRING GOALS IN THE NAME OF FIGHTING ‘SYSTEMIC RACISM’ ‘GENDER EQUITY CHALLENGES’

Disney did not deny the training but insisted that whistleblowers took it out of context.

Ticker Security Last Change Change % DIS THE WALT DISNEY CO. 105.80 +0.02 +0.02%

""These internal documents are being deliberately distorted as reflective of company policy when in fact their purpose was to allow diversity of thought and discussion on the incredibly complex and challenging issues of race and discrimination that we as a society and companies nationwide are facing"" the company said in a statement.

In August Rufo published internal documents showing that American Express subjected its employees to a series of critical race theory training sessions that encouraged staff to rank themselves on a hierarchy of ""privilege"" and apply that hierarchy in the workplace with the more ""privileged"" employees deferring to staff from ""marginalized groups.""

In the trainings the outside consulting firm Paradigm urged Amex employees to construct their own intersectional identities mapping their ""race sexual orientation body type religion disability status age gender identity [and] citizenship"" on an official company worksheet. Employees could then determine whether they have ""privilege"" or are members of a ""marginalized group."" Whites males heterosexual people Christians able-bodied people and citizens would presumably count as ""privileged.""

The training sessions also warned White employees to avoid certain phrases such as ""I don't see color"" ""We are all human beings"" and ""Everyone can succeed in this society if they work hard enough"" as ""microaggressions.""

In a high-profile ""anti-racism"" event Amex executives invited Khalil Muhammad a great-grandson of Nation of Islam founder Elijah Muhammad to speak on ""race in corporate America."" He argued that capitalism was founded on racism and that ""racist logics and forms of domination"" have shaped Western society since at least the Industrial Revolution. He even argued that the credit card company should reduce standards for Black customers and sacrifice profits in the interest of race-based reparations.

""If American Express cares about racial justice in the world it can’t simply say the market’s going to define how we price certain customers who happen to come from low-income communities"" he said. ""If you want to do good then you’re going to have to set up products and [product] lines that don’t maximize profit.""

AMERICAN EXPRESS ENGAGES IN ‘REVERSE DISCRIMINATION’ AGAINST WHITE PEOPLE CURRENT AND FORMER EMPLOYEES SAY

In September five current and former AmEx employees — speaking on condition of anonymity — told FOX Business that the company singles out Black people for promotion in a practice that former employees described as reverse discrimination against White people. The employees did not present internal documents to demonstrate an official policy but they said they witnessed a worrisome trend that raises questions about racial discrimination in promotion. One former employee said they quit because the critical race theory trainings and the apparent promotion of employees due to skin color sent the message that White employees could not expect to even be considered for promotion.

American Express denied this accusation in a statement.

""We have a high-achieving culture and we are proud of our dedicated and highly engaged colleagues"" an American Express spokesperson told FOX Business. ""Advancement within our company is based solely on individual business and leadership performance. Any characterization of our company and culture to the contrary is just plain wrong.""

The statement also claimed that the company's ""diversity equity and inclusion programs"" focus on upholding a commitment to ""a diverse and inclusive culture where all colleagues feel welcome and heard and have equal opportunities to thrive regardless of their gender race ethnicity age religion sexual orientation and nationality."" The programs ""are not based on any specific theory nor are they directed to a specific group of employees.""

In August Rufo revealed documents showing that Bank of America Lowe's and Truist Financial Corporation sponsored a United Way critical race theory ""Racial Equity 21-Day Challenge"" claiming that America is systemically and institutionally racist encouraging participants to ""decolonize"" their minds and get ""woke at work"" and urging white people to ""cede power to people of color.""

The Racial Equity 21-Day Challenge included a document with responses to potential objections. Should participants ask about reverse discrimination the guide claims that there is no such thing. The document also claims that people of color cannot be racist: ""Racism is used to justify the position of the dominant group White people in this case and to uphold White supremacy and superiority. Everyone can be biased and engage in bigoted and belittling behavior that is intolerant of other perspectives. But racism is by definition a form of oppression exercised by the dominant racial group (Whites).""

BANK OF AMERICA LOWE'S SPONSORED CRT TRAINING URGING WHITES TO ‘CEDE POWER TO PEOPLE OF COLOR’

Bank of America spokesman Bill Haldin told FOX Business that his company does not endorse these ideas and that it does not run its own employee trainings along these lines.

""This was not our program and not our training materials"" he said. ""The United Way ran this program independent of Bank of America and it is not part of our training material.""

Lowe's and Truist Financial did not respond to FOX Business' request for comment.

The pharmaceutical company Pfizer has set goals to fill a percentage of leadership positions with Black and Hispanic candidates by the year 2025 in the name of fighting ""systemic racism."" In September FOX Business reported on an Environmental Social & Governance (ESG) Report 2020  published in March 2021 in which Pfizer set ""opportunity parity goals"" for 2025. Those goals include ""increasing our minority representation from 19% to 32% and doubling the underrepresented population of African Americans/Blacks and Hispanics/Latinos.""

The report includes a letter from Albert Bourla Pfizer's chairman and CEO in which Bourla says he is ""proud"" of having ""set concrete goals to address systemic racism and gender equity challenges by reviewing and augmenting our plans to increase diversity and opportunity parity by 2025 particularly focusing on increasing female and U.S. minority representation at leadership levels.""

""We now have quotas basically in hiring and promotions"" explained a current Pfizer employee who spoke with FOX Business on condition of anonymity. The employee said the company hosted events with Ibram X. Kendi and encouraged employees to read books written by Robin DiAngelo two prominent CRT proponents.

""We don’t have quotas as part of our hiring process"" a Pfizer spokesperson told FOX Business. ""We stand by our Diversity Equity and Inclusion efforts as it relates to our human capital.

It was the year when we began to see the light at the end of the tunnel thanks to vaccines and there was also some economic euphoria after seeing a rebound in global growth but the social personal health systems and much of the economic activity continued to tip the balance towards crisis side.

Economic growth in Latin America and the Caribbean in 2021 stood at 6.3% of GDP a very positive figure after the sharp recession of 2020. But experts predict that maintaining these levels of growth will be difficult in the coming years. Thus countries in the region will have to reinforce their social protection systems invest more and better in infrastructure and work on increasing productivity and competitiveness.

In any case 2021 leaves us with some noteworthy development milestones in Latin America and the Caribbean:

Progress of vaccination in Latin America and the Caribbean

While the West and China advanced their vaccination plans at a frantic pace developing regions struggled to access vaccines in part due to the absence of drugs and poor infrastructure. Currently 57% of the world’s population is vaccinated.



But Latin America and the Caribbean was lagging in 2021 picking up pace towards the end of the year to close at 56% of the population. In the US and the EU around 61.5% of people have been vaccinated and about 80% in China. The differences within the region are also remarkable with countries such as Chile and Cuba with vaccination rates greater than 80% others with also high numbers such as Argentina (69%) Brazil (66%) and Uruguay (76%) and other still lagging with less than 40%. Despite the initial drawbacks all countries have ambitious vaccination plans to achieve herd immunity in the coming months which is a sign of the region’s responsiveness.

Economic upturn

The region is expected to grow by 6.3% in 2021 a necessary rebound after last year’s recession which helped prop up some industries and enhance others such as e-commerce or streaming. Despite the good news the major structural challenges of Latin America and the Caribbean remain more relevant than ever after the pandemic. One of them is the low potential growth dropping since 2015 which slowed the poverty reduction rate and inequality since the previous decade. Between 2015 and 2020 poverty rose by about 6 percentage points from the low of 27.8% in 2014. Half of that occurred with the collapse of economic activity and unemployment caused by the pandemic in 2020.





Latin America and the Caribbean leading climate action

More than 40000 international climate experts met in Glasgow for COP26 a global summit that was set to raise ambitions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and thereby achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.



For Latin America and the Caribbean it was a step forward in positioning itself as a relevant and necessary player in the fight against global warming thanks mainly to its rich biodiversity. The region also made strides in expanding financing for adaptation and mitigation initiatives and in its commitment to nature-based solutions. During COP26 CAF announced that it will allocate USD 25 billion over the next five years to promote green growth in the region expanding green operations from the current 24% to 40% by 2026.

Digitalization at the heart of countries’ agendas

The pandemic accelerated to varying degrees the digitalization of business commerce education and government at the global level. The region has an opportunity to consolidate digital transformation with greater investment in connectivity infrastructure foster the productive use of digital technologies close access gaps in households and workers and improve guarantees for data privacy. The regional scale can also be used to promote a regional digital market that can facilitate connectivity and digital entrepreneurship.

Time for multilateralism

The crisis has also exposed the need to reach new consensus and unite different stakeholders in promoting solutions. In this sense the role of development banks has been strategic in mobilizing funds to the region serving as a transmission belt for extra-regional capital and innovating in financial products to strengthen sectors that promote sustainable development create jobs and help reduce poverty.



In this connection CAF’s board of directors approved by consensus in early December a USD 7 billion capitalization thus doubling the portfolio by 2030 with a focus on a green bank and economic revival strategy to help lay the foundation for a more prosperous inclusive and environmentally friendly region.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBhbnRoZXJzLmNvbS9uZXdzLzUtdGhpbmdzLXRvLXdhdGNoLXlldHVyLWdyb3NzLW1hdG9zLWdyb3dpbmctaW50by1yb2xl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,5 Things To Watch: Yetur Gross-Matos growing into role,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3RvcGNsYXNzYWN0aW9ucy5jb20vbGF3c3VpdC1zZXR0bGVtZW50cy9tb25leS9iYW5raW5nLW5ld3MvYWxseS1jbGFzcy1hY3Rpb24tYWxsZWdlcy1iYW5rLWRlbmllcy1hY2NvdW50cy10by1ub24tdXMtY2l0aXplbnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ally Class Action Alleges Bank Denies Accounts to Non-US Citizens,"Top Class Actions’s website and social media posts use affiliate links.

Ally Bank Account Denial Class Action Lawsuit Overview:

Who: A woman who was brought to the United States as a child and is allowed to work under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program is suing Ally Bank.

Why: The woman says the bank denied her an account because she is not a U.S. citizen or legal permanent resident in violation of the law.

Where: The class action lawsuit was filed in a California federal court.

Ally Bank illegally denies non-United States residents access to bank accounts even if they are legally allowed to work in the country a new class action lawsuit alleges.

Plaintiff Mariela Aguilar Velazquez filed the class action complaint against Ally Bank Dec. 20 in a California federal court alleging violations of the Civil Rights Act and California Civil Code.

Aguilar is a recipient of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.

DACA is a policy that allows immigrants who were brought to the United States as children to receive a renewable two-year period of deferred action from deportation and become eligible for a work permit in the U.S.

Aguilar has had authorization to work in the United States and a Social Security Number since 2012. However in Nov. 2020 she says when she went to open a checking and savings account with Ally Bank she was unlawfully denied.

“Plaintiff Aguilar received a phone call from an Ally Bank representative informing Plaintiff Aguilar that she is ineligible to open a checking and savings account with Ally Bank because she is not a U.S. citizen or an Legal Permanent Resident” the lawsuit says. “Plaintiff Aguilar asked the representative whether this denial was allowed by law. The representative answered that it is Ally Bank’s policy to deny anyone who is not a U.S. citizen or permanent resident.”

Plaintiff Claims No Other Bank Denied Her An Account Because Of Immigration Status

Aguilar is alleging unlawful discrimination on the basis of alienage in violation of the Civil Rights Act and the Unruh Civil Rights Act as codified at California Civil Code. She said no other bank has denied her a bank account because of her immigration status.

“Plaintiff Aguilar suffered harm as a result of Ally Bank’s denial of her checking and savings account application because of her alienage” the lawsuit states. “Ally Bank’s denial of her application caused Plaintiff Aguilar to suffer emotional distress.”

She’s seeking to represent anyone in the United States who was denied a bank account from Ally Bank on the basis of alienage plus a California class.

She’s seeking certification of the class action an injunction damages fees costs and a jury trial.

In 2020 Wells Fargo agreed to pay a $20 million settlement to DACA recipients whose loan applications were denied by Wells Fargo.

The plaintiffs are represented by Deylin O. Thrift-Viveros of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund.

In January 2023 it had about 117.3 million shares outstanding worth about $3.35 each; by April it had 739.1 million worth about $0.30 each. Then it went bankrupt and now the shares are worth zero though you can find contrarian views.

These stock sales always struck me as extraordinarily cynical: Bed Bath pretty much knew that it would be filing for bankruptcy with no recovery for shareholders but it went out and raised a few hundred million dollars from meme-stock retail investors to hand directly to creditors.

Prop Du Toit scooped the ball up before forcing his way over with Finn Russell adding the conversion.

Nine minutes later Bath scored again but this time it needed checking. Du Toit fell short of the line but the ball found Spencer. The officials looked to see if there was a knock-on in the build-up but the try stood and was converted from close range.

Bath looked to be running away with it when Cokanasiga powered over in the right corner on 28 minutes before another Russell conversion.

The Falcons got on the board when Blamire forced himself over the line following a superb maul near the corner but Brett Connon's conversion fell just short.

Gallagher scythed through the Newcastle defence on 38 minutes and secured a bonus point with another converted try.

Blamire responded to end the half with his second following another driving maul. Again Connon failed to convert.

The frenetic pace to the match did not cease after the break; Newcastle were not letting go of the slim chance of a first victory in over a year and their scrum which had been dominant all night maintained their foothold in the game.

Stuart's try came after another strong drive as Newcastle made their superior territory and possession count.

Text description provided by the architects. Jocheon is a small village on the northeastern coast of Jeju. It is a seaside village known as a great place to see the sunrise every day. To the north is the blue sea of Jocheon and freshwater springs from the ground near the beach. Jocheon has been a clean and abundant village with clean spring water which was used by the people for washing and drinking before the waterworks were installed. This plot of land silently watching over the sea is about 18 square meters in size and is on the boundary between the beach of Jocheon and the freshwater springs.

This was a place for the travelers to begin and end their day. So what did it have to offer? We focused on the element of ‘water’ as harbored by the beach of Jocheon. We wanted the most daily element to give the most non-daily experience in this space. ‘Taking a bath’ is a very simple and daily action yet a powerful ritual of rearranging one’s mind and relieving the physical and mental fatigue. The Chinese character for bath is 浴 (Yok).

It represents the pouring water and means to clean the wastes with the force of water flowing downwards. We planned this space to be a place for relaxing and recharging focusing on the acts of washing and wiping in a space filled with various forms of water such as pouring water gushing water still water gazing water and steam.

The Jocheon Yokjang is a small bath place consisting of 3 floors that are about 15 square meters each. The building was designed to be within 50 square meters without a parking area so that the yard can be used more widely and it is a private space for only 2 people. The 3rd floor is a bathing space with an ocean view and various washing experiences. The 2nd floor is the bedroom and the 1st floor is the kitchen. The vertical concrete building is only open on the sides that come in contact with nature.

Only the surfaces that accept the ocean view and light are open and all other surfaces are completely shut from the outer world. The concrete walls have wood grain patterns that hold the movement of light. Along the basalt wall is the entrance path that opens into the garden and through the garden is the inside of the house. The entrance path is long enough to heighten the immersion in the space and the unpredictable changes of the space diversify the experience."

Warren Buffett's daughter-in-law couldn't think of a good Christmas gift for him so she showed him her company's finances.

Mary Buffett was married to the famed investor's son Peter from 1980 to 1993. The pair owned a music business together which played to her strengths as a former Columbia Records executive who had also managed the music-publishing companies of Playboy's late founder Hugh Hefner.

""The first year we were married I realized 'Warren is very rich'"" Mary told ThinkAdvisor in 2019. ""'Therefore he doesn't want anything.'""

""I didn't know what to get him so I put together our music company's balance sheet to show him that we were making money"" she said.

Unlike most people who walk Warren Buffett through their assets and liabilities Mary Buffett wasn't seeking an investment.

""I just wanted to show him 'Look we're doing good'"" she told ThinkAdvisor.

She also described more broadly what Christmas with the Buffetts was like: lots of food famous faces and debates about intrinsic value.

""When the family got together in Laguna over Christmastime all the titans of industry would be there"" she said in the interview. ""We'd have lunches and dinners and they'd all talk about companies. Investing was the only thing Warren ever talked about!""

Since divorcing Peter Buffett Mary Buffett has worked as a consultant and speaker founded an online school and taught business and finance to university students. She has also written nine books about Buffett according to her website.

Earlier this year Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway invested $500 million in a Brazilian fintech start-up called Nubank. This development is noteworthy because Warren Buffett seldom invests in start-ups preferring to stick to his “circle of competence”. Back in 2018 his company had surprised the business community when it had placed a rare bet in start-ups by investing $300 million in India’s Paytm. Paytm was listed last month and Nubank this month.

MIDAS has seen a 50% increase in the number of creative and digital sector investments into the region confirmed this year whilst professional services brought in over £99m GVA alone.

But Greater Manchester continued to show its resilience and tireless drive for growth collaboration new thinking and the development of exceptional talent and world class facilities – which is a compelling proposition for businesses looking to invest in the UK.

“Greater Manchester’s specialisms across digital and innovation sectors have shone – and we have secured the highest annual number of new jobs on record with further major inward investment relationships being built as we head towards 2022.

“We have strengthened our position as one of the world’s leading tech cities and a growing innovation hub – welcoming new global businesses to Greater Manchester as well as nurturing our startup and scaleup economy and strong links between business academia and the public sector.”

MIDAS recently supported a move to Manchester by international digital transformation and green coding specialist – GFT which supports global financial services businesses. There has been growth across the wider financial services sector including Warren Buffett-backed insurance market disrupter Berkshire Hathaway which opened its second UK HQ in Manchester to service all UK clients outside the M25.

Other projects MIDAS has supported this year include Tokyo University spinout Exergy Power Systems ultrafast grocery delivery pioneer Getir’s electric vehicle network and healthtech company SafeSteps as well as growth in the cyber sector with the arrival of Roke and Sophos."

Check out the hot scams of the week and see how many of them you’ve spotted!

Christmas Giveaway Scams

With Christmas being the season of giving most brands and companies hold giveaway campaigns and sales. However scammers impersonate these brands and send you fake messages with phishing links trying to trick you into clicking on them to claim gifts that don’t even exist.



The phishing links lead to fake online survey pages that state you can claim a gift by completing an online questionnaire. After you fill out the survey you are prompted to enter personal information such as credit card numbers before your “gift” can be delivered.



The scammers’ ultimate goal is to steal your information — they will record sensitive information you enter on these fake pages and use the data to commit cybercrimes: e.g. hack into your bank account withdraw money or steal your identity. Don’t let them!



This week we’ve found 3 Christmas giveaway scams:

1. Amazon – iPhone 11 Scam

We’ve seen Amazon anniversary scams and giveaway scams before and now a new Christmas version has been circulating via WhatsApp:

Source: Twitter

The link leads to a fake Amazon survey page. After you fill it out you are asked to share the link to your WhatsApp contacts and submit personal information. (Don’t do it!)

Source: Twitter

2. Best Buy – iPhone 13 Scam

Fake Best Buy iPhone 13 text messages have been popular for weeks but now scammers have added some extra bits to them to make them Christmassy:

Your cell carrier’s saying MERRY CHRlSTMAS with an earIy compIimentary upgr@de to the lphone13 <URL>

Again the attached link will lead you to a fake online survey page and you could eventually have your personal information exposed. Be careful!

3. Sam’s Club – iPad Pro Scam

Last week we reported on Sam’s Club email scams and we recently spotted a text message version that says Sam’s Club is giving away $250 and that you need to click a link to activate it:

CHRlSTMAS lS HERE! Sams C|ub’s giving you a (1) year membership & $25O. Must be ACTlVATED by 12/18 <URL>

Note: Please don’t submit any credentials here! You will never receive the promised iPad and scammers will have all your credit card details and use them for their own good.

NHS COVID Pass Phishing Scam

As the impact of COVID-19 is on the rise again scams about the COVID-19 vaccine PCR tests and health passports are back and circulating widely. Last week many people have received fake text messages from the National Health Service (NHS) that falsely claim you can apply for a COVID-19 vaccination passport online through the phishing link they provide:

NHS: You’re now eligible to get your NHS COVID pass. You could be fined if you don’t apply. Please visit nhs[.]digital-get-pass[.]com to apply for your pass.

Source: Reddit and Twitter

The link will take you to a fake NHS login page where you are required to enter your name as well as other personal information to apply for your (fake) COVID vaccination passport. Guess what? Scammers can record your credentials and use them for identity theft. Don’t fall for it!



Gift Card / Rewards Survey Scams via Email

Besides text messages scammers also use emails to spread fake survey campaigns. They guarantee you gift cards or rewards or ask you to check shipment details luring you to click on phishing links that lead to fake online survey pages where you could end up exposing your sensitive credentials.

1. PayPal Christmas Gift Card Scams

“Congratulations! Win a $750 PayPal Prepaid Card Christmas Survey.” Did you receive this email from “PayPal”? Don’t click on anything!

2. DHL Shipment Phishing Email

“Your package is waiting!🚚” Posing as DHL scammers try to trick you into thinking that your shipment has arrived so they can get you to click on the embedded button in the email — again that will take you to a fake login page. Don’t submit your account information!

USPS Lottery Scam

Who wants a Samsung Galaxy ZFold for Christmas? Well if you do please be extra careful and don’t fall for this fake USPS lottery email! Scammers falsely claim that you can get a prize if you fill out the survey. Sound familiar? We know what will happen if you click on the button — scammers will steal your personal information!

How to protect yourself

Double-check the sender’s mobile number/email address.

Free gifts or prizes are always a major red flag.

Where to go to safely check card balances,"Did Santa bring you a gift card this Christmas?

Year after year gift cards have been one of the most popular holiday gifts and 2021 was not an exception.

According to the National Retail Federation's annual holiday survey gift cards were the second most popular gift of the holiday season with 46% of shoppers planning to buy an average of three or four cards this year. Holiday spending on gift cards was expected to total $28.1 billion the highest since $29.9 billion in 2018.

And with supply chain challenges shipping delays and shortages more cards were expected to be placed in stockings than in past years.

►What's open Christmas Day 2021?:CVS Starbucks McDonald's and 7-Eleven but Walmart Costco closed

►Gift card deals:The best gift cards on sale that make perfect last-minute gifts: Adidas Amazon Disney+ and more

But when consumers will redeem the plastic cards or digital codes is another matter. According to a Bankrate.com poll from July 51% of U.S. adults have more than $15.3 billion in unused gift cards vouchers and store credit. This adds up to an average of $116 per person in gift cards.

Use your Christmas gift cards ASAP

The rule of thumb with a gift card? Use it before you lose it.

The Federal Trade Commission recommends using the card as soon as you can. It also advises treating gift cards like cash and using them early to get full value.

Another good reason to use the cards sooner rather than later: the risk that the retailer or restaurant goes out of business.

While gift cards are often accepted after businesses file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in many cases they quickly become worthless. Sometimes there's little or no warning before a business closes.

“I generally tell people if they have gift cards in their wallet use them yesterday"" Melissa Jacoby a bankruptcy law professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill previously told USA TODAY.

The Bankrate poll found 29% of adults have let at least one gift card expire 27% have lost at least one and 21% lost out because a business closed permanently before they used at least one card.

Check gift card balances (carefully)

It's important to go to the actual retailer or card website and to confirm you are at the right place before entering any information. If you're not careful you can wind up at a website that appears to be legitimate but could steal your gift card balance making it worthless.

USA TODAY has rounded up the sites to check the most popular store restaurant and credit card gift cards. This list is current as of Dec. 24. Another way to check balances is with store apps and some retailers like Target allow you to add gift cards to app wallets.

Amazon gift card balance

Amazon says you can view your gift card balance in your account. Also when you apply a gift card to an order or add one to ""Your Account"" for future purchases the balance will be stored. After you go to your account select ""Gift cards"" and view the balance on your gift cards.

Tips for using gift cards

If you received a gift card here are some tips to get the most out of them:

The fine print: Read the card's terms and conditions. Pay close attention to whether the card is redeemable only at a certain store or location.

Fees: Some state laws bar service fees and expiration dates on store gift cards but the rules on cards branded with the name of a credit card company are stricter. These cards cannot expire for at least five years and cannot have a service fee deducted unless it has not been used in 12 months.

Play these 5 games first,"Have you just unwrapped a Nintendo Switch for Christmas? If so then lucky you – and you'll likely be wondering which top Switch games you should play first. Fortunately we're here to help.

The Nintendo Switch has a library filled to the brim with excellent Switch games for you to choose from from third-party blockbusters to first-party exclusives. But with so much choice it can be difficult to know which games are worth jumping into right off the bat – and that's where we come in.

Below we've put together a list of five quintessential Nintendo Switch games that we think should be your first ports of call. We've tried to include a mixture of games that will dazzle and delight both adults and children so whether you've got the original Nintendo Switch the handheld Switch Lite or the upgraded Nintendo Switch OLED there should be something on this list to suit your tastes (though the Switch Lite isn't compatible with all these titles).

And if there's nothing in this roundup that takes your fancy you can always check out our best Switch games guide for a comprehensive list of top titles.

Animal Crossing: New Horizons (Image credit: Nintendo)

First up is the Switch game that everyone seemed to be playing upon its release: Animal Crossing: New Horizons.

New Horizons is the first new entry in the mainline Animal Crossing series for almost eight years and the first entry to be playable on the Nintendo Switch – and it was definitely worth the wait.

New Horizons whisks you off to a deserted island courtesy of an exclusive Nook Inc package holiday. Your job is to turn the island into a top resort attracting new islanders by sprucing things up and making your island a tropical paradise.

Animal Crossing: New Horizons is packed with charm and the perfect game for those who want to kick back and just take things at their own pace. It’s familiar and fresh deftly combining all the enjoyable elements of the series with some much-needed improvements and far greater depth than we’ve seen before. It just keeps giving too with regular seasonal updates keeping things fresh throughout the year.

Mario Kart 8 Deluxe (Image credit: Nintendo)

Wanting to share the Switch fun with family and friends? Then Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is just the ticket.

If you've played Mario Kart before then you probably know what to expect from this zany racer: Nintendo characters going pedal to the metal on a range of exciting themed race tracks.

Mario Kart 8 on the Wii U was already one of the best entries in the franchise and the enhanced Nintendo Switch version is no different – in fact it's even better. At its core the game offers the same excellent racing as the Wii U original but there are also a number of new additions for this version of the arcade racer.

Mario Kart 8 Deluxe includes a battle mode new characters all the previously released DLC tracks and the ability to hold two special items at a time to add an extra layer of strategy to your racing.

You can choose to play Mario Kart 8 Deluxe solo but we find multiplayer much more fun. You can play online in split-screen with up to four players or via wireless multiplayer (allowing up to eight players to connect multiple Switch consoles).

It's worth noting that due to the handheld nature of the Switch Lite this Switch game is more suited to the hybrid Nintendo Switch or Switch OLED. Mario Kart is compatible with the Lite but to play with more than one player you will need Joy-Cons.

Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is a versatile release and well worth picking up for anyone who missed out on Mario Kart 8 the first time around.

Super Mario Odyssey (Image credit: Nintendo) (Image credit: Nintendo)

Super Mario Odyssey was Mario's first real outing on the Nintendo Switch and it remains one of the best games on the console.

Odyssey is a 3D sandbox adventure that sees Mario travel between a wide range of worlds to save Princess Peach from the nefarious and maritally-minded Bowser. Giving the old formula a bit of a refresh this game sees the traditional Power Ups replaced with a new companion for Mario called Cappy. This sentient hat is Mario's weapon and friend and he can be used to possess enemies and objects in order to solve puzzles and defeat foes.

While Odyssey is primarily a single-player game you can also play two-player couch-co-op – with one player taking on the role of the iconic plumber and the other playing as Cappy (though Switch Lite players will need Joy-Cons for this).

If you loved Super Mario 64 or Super Mario Sunshine then you'll probably love Super Mario Odyssey too.

Super Smash Bros. Ultimate (Image credit: Nintendo) (Image credit: Nintendo)

Super Smash Bros. Ultimate The ultimate brawler Today's Best Deals $40 at Amazon $44.98 at Walmart $59.99 at Best Buy Reasons to buy + Exciting and inclusive roster + A mode for every occasion + Great fun to play solo or with others Reasons to avoid - Online play can stumble

Want to play a Nintendo Switch game that packs a punch? Then Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is probably for you – it's got plenty.

The fifth entry in the Smash Bros. series Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is a crossover fighting game that sees you playing as a variety of Nintendo and third-party characters with choices including the likes of Link Mario and Mega Man and attempting to knock your opponents out of an arena.

Super Smash Bros. Ultimate packs in more fighters more stages more gameplay modes and more tactical elements than any game in the franchise. It is to all intents and purposes the definitive Super Smash Bros. with everything that entails – and plenty of juicy Smash Bros DLC (Joker! Piranha Plant! Banjo-Kazooie!) to keep you occupied after you've unlocked the main roster of fighters.

Like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Super Smash Bros. Ultimate can be played solo but it's much more fun in multiplayer. You can play online in split-screen with up to four players or via wireless multiplayer (allowing up to eight players to connect multiple Switch consoles). Also like Mario Kart Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is great to play solo on the Switch Lite but multiplayer is more suited to the Nintendo Switch or Switch OLED.

The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (Image credit: Nintendo) (Image credit: Nintendo)

Last but certainly not least is The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild which is not only considered one of the best Switch games of all time but one of the best games full stop.

Set at the end of the Zelda timeline Breath of the Wild sees protagonist Link awaking from a hundred-year slumber to embark on a mission to defeat the evil Calamity Ganon and restore the ravaged kingdom of Hyrule.

While past Zelda games have stuck pretty closely to the formula established by Ocarina of Time (the series' 3D debut) Breath of the Wild throws much of the established wisdom away offering more RPG elements than other games in the franchise.

The entire map is opened up to you almost immediately allowing you to approach the game in whatever order you see fit. You can spend hours just climbing trees and brewing elixirs or you can even head straight to the game’s final boss battle if you're feeling a little more confident. Breath of the Wild's puzzles too are less rigid than other games in the series implementing physics-based problem-solving that often means there are multiple solutions to each challenge depending on how you combine your various skills.

The result is a game that feels incredibly broad in scope with so many little touches to discover that it’s hard not to fall in love with this long-running series all over again – and if you haven't played a Zelda game before it could be love at first sight.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpbmVtYWJsZW5kLmNvbS9zdHJlYW1pbmctbmV3cy9ncmVhdC1hbGZyZWQtbW9saW5hLW1vdmllcy1hbmQtaG93LXRvLXdhdGNoLXRoZW0tb25saW5l0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,10 Great Alfred Molina Movies And How To Watch Them Online,"Throughout his career Alfred Molina has played historical figures like Diego Rivera and iconic comic book characters like Dr. Otto Octavius. With those characters and dozens of others Molina is able to get the most out of each of his roles and make them feel human even with those who are detestable to say the very least. We see it all the time and chances are we’ll continue to see as he career marches on.

If you watched Spider-Man: No Way Home and want to revisit some of Alfred Molina’s best movies or perhaps take a journey through his catalogue of work for the first time you have come to the right place. Below are 10 of his best film offerings plus a little bonus item at the end.

Spider-Man 2 (2004)

The second installment in Sam Raimi’s trilogy Spider-Man 2 follows Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) as he comes face-to-face with one of his deadliest enemies Doc Ock (Alfred Molina) after a failed experiment turns the ambitious Dr. Otto Octavius into man driven mad by his own shortcomings and trapped in his own machine.

The strength of the movie lies in Molina’s portrayal of a man tortured by failure and guilt when his attempt to make the world a better place blows up in his face and takes everything he’s ever loved. Molina didn’t need to be this good in order for Spider-Man 2 to work but we’re all better off because of his dedication to the role.

Frida (2002)

Julie Taymor’s 2002 Academy Award-winning biopic Frida focuses on the life of famed Mexican artist Frida Kahlo (Salma Hayek) from the accident that left her with lifelong injuries up to the opening of her first solo exhibition in her home country. Along the way Kahlo meets and falls in love with Diego Rivera (Alfred Molina) a talented artist with problematic political affiliations.

Objectively Diego Rivera is not a great person throughout Frida. He is stubborn unfaithful to his wife and difficult. Despite that Alfred Molina finds the humanity in the man and his art and in turn creates a transfixing portrayal of the complicated artist.

Boogie Nights (1997)

Paul Thomas Anderson's Boogie Nights centers on the seedy world that was the San Fernando Valley in 1977 largely told through the eyes of busboy-turned-pornstar Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg) aka Dirk Diggler. This movie like most of PTA’s work has a large ensemble cast that tells a cautionary tale of fame excess and infamy with some of his best characters.

Alfred Molina shows up near the end of the movie as Rahad Jackson a drug dealer Todd Parker (Thomas Jane) attempts to rip off much to the chagrin of Dirk Diggler and Reed Rothchild (John C. Reilly). Molina’s appearance demeanor and manic behavior make it to where you can’t stop watching even though something bad is waiting right around the corner.

Magnolia (1999)

Paul Thomas Anderson’s epic psychological drama Magnolia follows an assortment of characters whose lives are connected in one way or another. One of the main focuses of the movie is on Donnie Smith (William H. Macy) who won a quiz show as a kid but never amounted to anything in adulthood. Just before reaching his breaking point Donnie is fired from his job during a comical yet intense scene with his employer Solomon Solomon (Alfred Molina).

This is another Alfred Molina performance where he gets so much out of so little and provides one of the best scenes of the movie. When you watch or rewatch this scene just focus on Molina’s facial expressions (specifically his eyebrows) and pick up the story they tell. You could even watch it on mute and still pick up exactly what he’s thinking and feeling.

Prick Up Your Ears (1987)

Directed by Stephen Frears the 1987 biographical drama Prick Up Your Ears tells the story of British playwright Joe Orton (Gary Oldman) and his companion Kenneth Halliwell (Alfred Molina) as they go from drama school classmates to friends and eventually lovers. But all is not well with the relationship and the pair begin to drift in two different directions when Orton finds professional successes triggering something in his lover.

This is not to take anything away from Gary Oldman’s performance in Prick Up Your Ears but Alfred Molina steals the show whenever he’s on screen here. The way in which he captures the fear hurt and disgust of his character is truly something to behold and takes the movie to a higher level.

An Education (2009)

Lone Scherfig’s 2009 coming-of-age drama An Education follows Jenny Mellor (Carey Mulligan) a teenager with dreams of attending Oxford University who is swept off her feet by an older sophisticated man named David Goldman (Peter Sarsgaard). The fast and furious romance seems like the real deal and even Jenny’s parents Jack (Alfred Molina) and Marjorie (Cara Seymour) are impressed by the dashing man but all is not as it appears.

There are a few standout moments by Alfred Molina throughout An Education with the most heartbreaking of the bunch coming in a pivotal scene in which Jack attempts to apologize to his daughter after a terrible revelation. Though the apology is far from perfect Molina is able to capture the pain and misgivings of a father who thought he was doing the right thing.

Chocolat (2000)

Lasse Hallström’s 2002 drama Chocolat tells the story of Vianne Rocher (Juliette Binoche) a free-flowing chocolatier who arrives in a modest and rather strict French village and impacts the lives of the townspeople by opening their eyes to new experiences. Vianne finds success with with a chocolate shop and with strong relationships with several people in town but finds resistance with its mayor Comte de Reynaud (Alfred Molina) which leads to a series of complications.

The character of Comte de Reynaud could have been just your standard authority figure who resists change but Alfred Molina’s portrayal makes the town leader seem all the more complicated and realistic. This isn’t to say he’s a great person but he is far from evil or immune to redemption.

Love Is Strange (2014)

Love is Strange a 2014 romantic drama film directed by Ira Sachs follows Ben Hull (John Lithgow) and George Garea (Alfred Molina) a same-sex couple who decide to tie the knot after nearly 40 years a couple. But when this news is discovered by George’s employer the Archdiocese of New York he is fired and the couple is forced to live in separate apartments with friends and family until they can find a home they can afford together.

No surprise here but Alfred Molina and John Lithgow are astonishing in Love is Strange and have this chemistry that makes them seem like much more than characters on the screen. Both are at the top of their game here and make it a movie that you have to watch.

The Front Runner (2018)

Jason Reitman’s 2018 political drama The Front Runner explores how Gary Hart (Hugh Jackman) went from Democratic presidential nominee in 1988 to another political figure haunted by past relationships. Over the course of the hectic episode multiple people enter the fray looking for blood including journalists at The Washington Post including edited Ben Bradlee (Alfred Molina) who is facing crises of his own with the changing media landscape.

Alfred Molina’s Ben Bradlee is neither hero nor villain in The Front Runner but instead a complicated man somewhere in the middle. His decisions in covering of the Gary Hart scandal weigh heavily on him throughout the movie and that wear and tear of his psyche is portrayed beautifully by the actor.

The Normal Heart (2014)

Ryan Murphy’s 2014 HBO original film The Normal Heart follows Alexander “Ned” Weeks (Mark Ruffalo) as he leads a crusade alongside other gay men across the country to expose the truth behind the AIDS crisis and to raise awareness for treatment before it’s too late. In addition to convincing the public of the grave situation Ned must also win over his older and more conservative brother Ben Weeks (Alfred Molina).

One of the biggest threads throughout The Normal Heart is the brotherly relationship shared by Ned and Ben Weeks which is made all the better by Mark Ruffalo and Alfred Molina. The way they play off one another looks and feels less like two actors on a soundstage and more like two brothers trying to understand one another.

BONUS: Raiders Of The Lost Ark (1981)

Before he was sitting atop the box office with one of the biggest Marvel Phase 4 movies Alfred Molina made his feature film debut as the double-crossing guide Satipo who betrayed Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) in Raiders of the Lost Ark.

Here she gives some advice for managing anxiety stress and worries.

–The C in CBT is “cognitive” – the way that we think and take in information. It’s about how we interpret events influenced by the beliefs that we hold about ourselves and the world. For example if you’re a person who feels inadequate criticism will mean a lot more to you than to someone who’s confident.

–The B is the behavioural bit how we respond to our distress. If you feel really scared of something your instinct might be to avoid it or to do something to give yourself a sense of safety. However this can reinforce your fears or negative thinking.

Cognitive behaviour therapist Catriona Larkin thinks we all need to go to comedy clubs more; we release so much pent-up stress with a good belly laugh

–The story of how we feel and think about ourselves starts on day one and as we grow up we develop strategies rules to survive and get our needs met in the world. However all too often those rules are rigid: “I must make sure I’m nice to everybody or I’m a horrible person;” or “I must do everything perfectly or I’m a failure.”

READ MORE

–We all have a unique story about how we feel the way we do but our thoughts and beliefs are not facts. Everyone has a “not good enough belief” at some strength. You need to remember that many core beliefs about yourself were formed in childhood. And the child who believed they weren’t good enough also believed other things that weren’t true like who put presents under the Christmas tree.

–The key is understanding why we might feel think and even physically react a certain way and then to challenge our interpretations. For example if I’m thinking “I’m not good enough because my boss said I did something the wrong way” that’s an inaccurate distorted interpretation because everybody does things wrong.

–Accept the way you are. Most of us don’t. We are the way we are through a combination of genes and experiences – experiences we have little control over. We don’t choose our parents or where we grow up or the pool of people to find friends from and so on. And yet we’re so judgmental about ourselves. Practicing acceptance doesn’t mean we don’t try to change or work on things but we do it kindly and non-judgmentally.

–Start by normalising feelings. A lot of people think that you should feel happy all the time but nobody does. Feelings are crucial for human survival. Emotions act as signals when things are not okay and need our attention. The problem is when they get stuck which happens when we think and behave in unhelpful ways particularly with anxiety.

–Anxiety is about perceived threat. If we feel anxious and fearful our caveman brain is basically signalling “danger”. Despite evolution our brains still only know how to deal with danger by getting ready to fight or freeze or flee. However there’s no one to punch or it’s not appropriate to run away. It’s really helpful to identify why you’re anxious what your brain is interpreting as dangerous. For a person with social anxiety it might be about being judged negatively. For someone with OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder) it might be having to prevent harm coming to other people. Someone with health anxiety may fear there’s something wrong with them.

–Once you understand why you are anxious examine the accuracy of the threat. People tend to overestimate the chances and extent of bad things happening; and to minimise their ability to cope.

Responding to thoughts

–How you respond to your thoughts is really important. If somebody with social anxiety never speaks in public then that keeps the problem going forever. Or somebody who’s depressed may withdraw from people because they think nobody cares about what they have to say but that reinforces their belief and they spiral down and down. It’s about breaking the cycle so you can think more realistically. It’s not about positive thinking. It’s not about replacing your negative thoughts. It’s about realistic thinking.

–Don’t believe everything you think. As Shakespeare’s Hamlet said: “...there is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so”.

–Humans have many typical thinking errors. They include catastrophising/overestimating the chances of disaster. With rigid black and white thinking things are either good or bad; there’s no middle ground. One I come across often is jumping to conclusions where people presume they know what’s going to happen as if they have a crystal ball or mind-reading assuming they know what someone else is thinking: “I know they don’t like me.” Another big distortion is where people have a list of “shoulds”: “I should be nice to everyone” or “I should be able to do this.” A simple tip is to change “shoulds” to “coulds” for example “I could be able to do this.”

–To escape those thinking patterns first catch and name what you’re doing. We often already know the answers to correcting these errors because it is exactly the stuff we’d say to our friends or to people we love who were being really negative about themselves or “mind-reading”.

–Separating problems from worries is really helpful. A problem has to be currently happening or within your control versus a hypothetical worry which is not currently happening and not within your control. If you’re going on holiday in the morning and you haven’t packed that’s an actual problem; versus sitting worrying there might be a pile-up on the M50 or the plane might crash. We have to let worries like these go. That can be very hard for some people. But we need to tolerate the stuff we don’t have control over. We have to accept that the world is uncertain.

Time to worry

–Try postponing worries. I use the analogy of putting worries into a rucksack. You carry it and sometimes you forget it’s there. Then you can sort through what’s in the rucksack at an allocated worry time.

–Set aside time to problem solve. We go around all day with things spinning in our heads; we’re not constructively thinking things through or deciding on a healthy response.

–Ruminating and worry are both kinds of overthinking but worrying is about stuff that hasn’t happened yet and ruminating is about stuff that has. You’re not going to gain or change anything by going over and over some mistake you’ve made. It just makes you feel worse. Work on bringing your attention back to the present to what’s in front of you.

–One important technique we all need to learn is pressing the pause button before we act or blurt things out. It doesn’t usually end well when we act in emotion. Mindfulness is all based on this idea that we don’t just react that we choose a behaviour. The key is that pause button.

–So whether you’re being criticised at work angry with another driver or stressed getting the kids out to school pause and reflect. If you don’t you’ll react in emotion and probably shout at the kids. Name what you are feeling. And then be curious: “What’s going on that has me feeling this?” If it’s something you’re anxious about then you’re obviously perceiving danger. If it’s something you’re sad about you’re probably perceiving loss. If you’re angry you’re perceiving injustice. The feelings are the hints about what’s going on in your mind. Once you have an awareness you can evaluate and choose a behaviour based on logic rather than emotion – one less likely to get you fired or to lose sleep over. It’s hard to do but so useful when we get the hang of it.

–Our minds are like Velcro for negative information but like Teflon for the positive. Many people keep gratitude logs but try a positive data log. Every day you reflect on the things that you did well and the positive things that happened and what that must mean about you as a person. For example “A friend texted. That means I’m likeable.” It’s not about positive thinking. It’s about allowing the positive information in.

Weighing up stress

–Stress is when your demands outweigh your resources. It’s like a weighing scales. Everything you have to do: getting up on time commuting talking to people parenting caring… all that stuff is on one side. When that’s really heavy you have to balance it with resources everything from your health to getting exercise and enough sleep to having a laugh. Laughing is underrated. Fun is underrated. We release so much pent-up stress with a good belly laugh. We all need to go to comedy clubs more.

–If the scales are tipping you've got to notice and bring it back to balance or you will end up getting anxious or low or whatever health-related issues comes with that. Look at your life and the things weighing you down. Ask which actually matter to you? Pick off those that don't or else you've got to add to your resources to cope. It could be a walk an hour or two of Netflix when the kids are in bed or listening to music in the car but it's the time when you allow yourself to breathe and don't think about all the ""shoulds"" you should be doing."

The private-equity giant has held a significant ownership stake in 10 companies that went public on the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq this year including one business that got sold to a so-called SPAC or special-purpose acquisition company.

Half of those companies — including the Bumble dating app and the Oatly oat drink brand — are now trading well below their offering prices. Indeed four of them have fallen more than 30 percent over the past 90 days including Oatly whose stock has plunged 50 percent to $8.14 from $16.30 while Bumble has dropped 35 percent during that same period to $34.87 from $53.50.

That’s in sharp contrast to the S&P 500 which is up 24 percent on the year and the Nasdaq which rose 19 percent.

To be sure the IPO aftermarket has been a disappointment this year across the board. While nearly 1000 companies went public in 2021 — an unprecedented crop of deals that raised a record $300 billion in proceeds — their stocks were down 20 percent this year versus the S&P 500 according to University of Florida Professor Jay Ritter who is known as “Mr. IPO” for his work on initial public offerings.

Many newly listed companies especially in tech and health care have not grown quickly enough to justify their lofty trailing revenue trading multiples some of which exceeded 20 times earnings Ritter said. The Renaissance IPO exchange-traded fund which tracks recent IPOs is off 9 percent this year.

“Investors were buying IPOs on a lot of optimistic assumptions” Ritter told The Post.

Still Blackstone has left itself open to criticism especially when listing companies it has invested in through its growth fund.

Oatly which listed its shares in May missed earnings forecasts in its most recent quarter. Last month Oatly revealed in a securities filing that it was forced to conduct a limited recall related to “loose metal items” found in its milk-processing equipment.

Meanwhile Bumble — founded by tech entrepreneur Whitney Wolfe — posted a decline in overall user growth in its third quarter with analysts fretting that its pandemic-driven user growth isn’t sustainable. Total paying users dropping to 2.87 million in the three months through September down from 2.93 million in the prior quarter.

Shortly after its February IPO Bumble traded as high as $84.80 a share. On Thursday the dating app closed at $34.87.

Sema4 Holdings a genetic-testing business spun out of Mount Sinai Health Systems merged with a blank-check company and started trading in July. Sema4 lost $89 million in operating profit last quarter on $43 million of revenue and also loses money at the gross margin level. Some investors fret that the company may not be able to renew big contracts it won during the pandemic.

“The interesting thing is the root cause of the poor stock price performance in all of these appears to be operational execution missteps and poor business models and not market changes” one IPO investor remarked. “Why are some of these companies public? ”

Sema4 shares in the last 90 days have fallen by more than 40 percent to $4.67.

Blackstone told The Post its 2021 IPOs have delivered “exceptional absolute and relative performance” — calculating that they are up 32 percent on average from when they went public.

That stat however includes auto technology company Sona Comstar which listed its shares on the National Stock Exchange of India.

Elsewhere Blackstone’s biggest winners include Texas-based business process outsourcing company TaskUs which since its June IPO is up 115 percent. Health company Apria is up 53 percent year to date and Imago Biosciences is up 45 percent on the year and is still rising.

“Many of these IPOs are high-growth technology and life-sciences businesses — with those sectors and many other IPOs seeing similar retracement in the fourth quarter nearly across the board” a Blackstone spokesman said.

“We also believe these companies are well positioned for long-term success and continue to be substantial stockholders in alignment with their public shareholders.”

More broadly Blackstone pointed to its “strong track record of helping build many highly successful public companies for the long-term” citing Hilton whose IPO investors it said have tripled their money. Blackstone-backed Tradeweb is trading at nearly 4 times its IPO price and Invitation Homes has more than doubled according to the Blackstone spokesman.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGVsbWFuYWdlbWVudC1uZXR3b3JrLmNvbS9uZXdzL2JsYWNrc3RvbmUtZXhwbG9yZXMtc2FsZS1vZi1nNi1ob3NwaXRhbGl0eS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Blackstone explores sale of G6 Hospitality,"Budget hotel brands have reportedly performed better in the lodging industry during most of the pandemic period.

New York-based Blackstone’s real estate unit is considering the divestment of G6 Hospitality that could take the valuation of the owner of budget hotel brands to over $1bn.

G6 Hospitality owns hotel brands Motel 6 and Studio 6.

The private equity firm is working with advisers according to an exclusive report of Bloomberg which cited people familiar with the matter.

It is the initial stages of seeking interest from potential buyers in G6 Hospitality.

A Blackstone representative declined to comment said the media outlet.

In 2012 these brands were acquired by Blackstone from France-based Accor as part of a $1.9bn deal which included more than 1000 hotels.

Since then the firm has divested most of the real estate.

As per the filing out of the around 1200 Motel 6 locations in the US at the end of 2020 over 1050 were owned by franchisees.

Texas US-based G6 Hospitality is led by CEO Rob Palleschi.

While Motel 6 which opened its first location in California in 1962 is a budget hotel brand Studio 6 is an extended-stay chain.

In 1999 a Motel 6 hotel was transformed to first Studio 6 in El Paso Texas. Currently Studio 6 has over 100 properties.

Blackstone had teamed up with Starwood Capital Group to acquire mid-priced lodging brand Extended Stay and a real estate investment trust ESH Hospitality for around $6bn earlier this year.

Budget hotel brands have performed better in the lodging industry during most of the pandemic period.

This is the first-ever officially-licensed Boeing piece of hardware. Inspired by the Boeing 787 this is a 1:1 scale replica of the yoke with full pendular movement replicating the sensation when moving the yoke back and forth. The internals is made from 100% metal construction and designed with detailed sensors to ensure durability after sustained use.

Across the yoke you will find a large number of buttons controls switches and even a headphone jack to make your experience as accessible as possible. In total there are 35 action buttons across both the yoke and throttle quadrant. Furthermore a slot on top of the yoke allows you to dock your tablet or mobile device.

In addition to the yoke a quadrant is included in the pack that allows you to swap out throttles for speed brake or flap levers (4 of which are included). On the quadrant you also have access to a number of other buttons that allow you to control the aircraft’s altitude speed and heading.

In our review we described the TCA Yoke Pack Boeing Edition as being “really awesome!” thanks to the Pendul_R™ system adjustable springs for the tension a mini control stick for the camera and a headphone jack.

My biggest takeaway from this review is that the yoke really is awesome! The feel of the Pendul_R™ system adjustable springs for the tension a mini control stick for the camera and a headphone jack were all new features I didn’t know I wanted until I had them in front of me. The throttle is nice for what it is. I liked the size of the handles and it was very comfortable to use but it wasn’t really anything special in my opinion. Especially as a single unit. It really needed that 4th axis along with the reverse thrust arms to impress me further. Patrick FSElite Review

The Thrustmaster TCA Yoke Pack Boeing Edition is compatible with all key simulator platforms but has been designed to automatically register with Microsoft Flight Simulator. In addition you can plug the controls into either a PC or into your Xbox console.

Numerous retailers have the Thrustmaster TCA Yoke Pack Boeing Edition in stock right now for $499 USD / £449.00. You can order from Aerosoft Amazon Thrustmaster Microsoft and FlightSimWebShop. Some retailers may only have backorders at the time of writing.

After Airbus and the peeling paint headaches of its composite A350 it now seems that Boeing may have a similar issue with its composite 787.

Composite materials bring substantial advantages in aircraft manufacturing and design. Aluminium has plenty of merits and it can be built into incredibly light structures too. But materials like carbon fibre have more elasticity which brings new benefits. The 787’s unusually “bendy” high aspect ratio wings are one of them.

But new materials come with new challenges. And it seems that after Airbus Boeing has its own peeling paint issues with its 787. To be clear Boeing maintains that the nature of this problem is different from that of Airbus’ A350. But it still relates to painting and composites. In this case the problem is in the wings of an unspecified number of 787s belonging to Air New Zealand.

Boeing Peeling Paint and Composites

The aluminium-alloy wings of previous aircraft designs usually have little or no paint on them. But planes like the Boeing 787 the Airbus A350 the smaller A220 and UAC’s MC-21 need paint (hopefully not peeling) on their composite wings. Like the fuselage in the A350 the 787’s wings also have a copper layer to help create a Faraday cage. This is to help guard against lightning strikes. But we don’t know if this peeling paint issue has to do with the way Boeing implemented this layer.

In the case of the fuselage of the A350 the paint the carbon fibre fuselage and the copper mesh between them have to stick together as the aircraft pressurizes and depressurizes expanding and contracting accordingly. This expansion is not an issue with a wing. But the wing bends up and down as it takes the plane’s weight. And the Boeing 787’s wing bends a lot – which makes it more challenging to keep the paint from peeling.

In this case it appears that Boeing believes the issue relates to UV light which degrades the paint. Like Airbus Boeing is adamant that this peeling paint is not a safety of flight issue. It’s also not an urgent issue to repair. According to reports Air New Zealand’s 787s will fly to the US next May to get new paint. They will also get a new protective layer against UV light to keep the issue from reoccurring.

Options for Fixes

This is a long-term solution. Boeing also offers shorter-term fixes like local touch-ups to take care of the peeling paint. The manufacturer states that it is working closely with its customers (plural) to address this cosmetic issue. So we can assume that more airlines have such issues with Boeing accommodating their needs to offer the right fix.

As we have seen Qatar and Airbus have now gone the legal route with regards to the A350’s paint issues. We also know that Qatar has a sizeable fleet of 787s: 30 787-8s and 7 operational 787-9s with more on order. Its aircraft are a bit older on average than those of Air New Zealand.

Like Boeing Airbus has offered to solve the peeling paint issues of its A350 customers. Qatar wasn’t happy with this solution however. It will be interesting to see how prevalent the issue is with the world’s 787 fleet. But unlike Airbus and the A350 Boeing and the 787 has more pressing issues these days.

Chelsea F.C. owner Roman Abramovich already owns an $80 million private jet that comes with gold fittings a banquet hall an anti-missile system and more. He is also the proud owner of a $610 million megayacht Solaris that comprises 48 cabins across eight decks and is secure as the Air Force One. Ordinarily one would stop at these huge splurges (maintenance must be another ballgame). Still the billionaire has recently shopped for a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner jet expanding his $1.2 billion superyacht collection and $22 million worth of cars. His newest toy is the world’s most expensive private jet as the 50-seater aircraft boasts a base cost of $300 million.





If rumor mills are to be believed an additional $102 million of equipment as per the taste of the very wealthy owner of Millhouse are outfitted in the giant aircraft. The plane comes with its history; it was built seven years ago for PrivatAir a Swiss airline operator. Unfortunately the company filed for bankruptcy in 2018 leaving it open for the grasp of Roman Abramovich. It is believed to be one of only two privately owned aircraft globally—the rest amount to 250 among all airlines put together.



This aircraft accommodates nearly 50 passengers including ten seats dedicated to security personnel ten staff and thirty guests. Buying the entire aircraft isn’t everyone’s cup of tea but many millionaires would like to charter the plane on occasion. To book an hour of flying on what is undoubtedly the most luxurious Boeing 787 in the world one needs a minimum of $74000 (an eight-hour flight from London to New York could cost around $600000).



Basing our assumptions on the private Boeing 787 Dreamline which is similar to the one made for Roman Abramovich the aircraft will flaunt a master suite fit for the king that he is. It will be outfitted with a walk-in closet a television and in Abramovich’s model there will be many more stunning additions. A few large cabins for guests a lavish dining area and a separate lounge area are a given. According to Daily Mail Boeing 787 Drealiner’s en-suite bathroom is spread across 2300-square-foot of space. This may be Abramovich’s second private jet after his Boeing 767-33AER but the gorgeous machine is said to be Russia’s first!

Designed by Kohn Pedersen Fox and developed by Boston Properties the 55-story structure will rise from a 25000-square-foot rectangular site between East 44th and 45th Streets that is currently occupied by a 15-story building that formerly housed the Metropolitan Transportation Authority headquarters. The new tower will yield 832613 square feet of office space 5357 square feet of retail space and 5357 square feet of subterranean circulation paths to Grand Central Terminal and the future East Side Access project. Rezoning plans for 343 Madison Avenue were approved by the City Council in mid November.

Not much change is outwardly visible since our last update in September. The entire building remains covered in black netting and metal scaffolding. We should really start to see momentum pick up next year as the old structure is dismantled level by level.

Current renderings of 343 Madison Avenue give us a street-level perspective looking down Madison Avenue with the double-height lobby space and a corner entrance leading to the Long Island Railroad.

The most prominent architectural feature of the design is the series of large multi-story trusses spanning the setbacks in the building massing. These sections are shown to be highlighted with bronze-colored walls and lined with landscaped terraces overlooking the Midtown skyline. The structure culminates in a rectangular glass volume housing a green wall tucked underneath a flat roof parapet.

The following renderings below give us a sense of the scale and presence of 343 Madison Avenue among the Midtown skyline. One of the main highlights that distinguishes the design from the surrounding towers is its series of large-scale diagonal trusses in front of bronze-colored walls. Above these sections appear to be multiple outdoor terraces populated with tall trees and amenity spaces stretching as high as the top level. The building is capped with a multi-story space with a soaring ceiling heights and a green wall enclosed in glass on all sides. Floodlights will illuminate the vegetation and act as the focal point of the crown for 343 Madison Avenue.

The rendering below is oriented looking north at the top of the eastern and southern elevations where the elevator core extends above the roof parapet. This rectilinear part of the superstructure would be enclosed with metal panels interspersed with thin vertical strips of glass that expose parts of the egress staircases.

YIMBY last reported that excavation for 343 Madison Avenue is expected to begin sometime next year and construction is anticipated to be completed by 2026.

Are you one of those people who waits to get their Christmas tree until December 23 every year? And then promises next year you’ll start decorating sooner only for it never to happen? Well next year could actually be your year if you buy this one-of-a-kind farm with over 3000 Christmas trees.

Evergreens aren’t the only thing Brook Pond Wood Meadow Farm has to offer. This Sherborn estate’s current owner Harley Kaplan says this farm is the “most unique” in Massachusetts. And he may be right: This 17-acre property comes with thousands of Christmas trees an orchard horse stalls and four buildings that offer a total of 9660 square feet of living space. The four-bedroom main house comes with a sun room a home office and plenty of charming features including cathedral ceilings and a wood-burning stove.

The farm itself is self-sustaining—only some cutting and pruning required Kaplan says. Throughout the grounds which stretch an entire block you’ll find running biking hiking snowshoeing and cross country skiing trails. Between that and the conservation land bordering the property you can wander for hours without encountering another soul. But at the same time you’re still within commuting distance of Boston for whenever you decide you need a bit of human company.

Kaplan is only the second owner of the property in 85 years with the first being a pair of doctors from Natick who owned the place as their summer home. Having completely redesigned the space on his own and raised his family here he’s picky about who will own it next. Kaplan says he’s already turned down five offers (including several from developers) on this one-of-a-kind estate to make sure it ends up in the right hands.

“I’m really looking for the right person to buy the house” he says. “It’s that unique. Right now in the pandemic there’s nowhere else in the world you want to be.”

The retired Philadelphia Eagles center bizarrely accused Secretariat the horse that won the Triple Crown in 1973 of cheating during the latest episode his his New Heights podcast with brother Travis Kelce.

'Secretariat was juiced to the gills' Kelce claimed on the podcast. 'Secretariat just so happens to be right in the heart of the steroid era.

'(In) 1973 every NFL player every baseball player they were juicing them to the gills. You don't think Secretariat was f–king juiced to the rafters? Of course it's the fastest horse of all-time.'

His comments sparked backlash on social media ultimately forcing Kelce into apologizing with one user claiming that the legendary center must have CTE - the brain disease many NFL stars have been diagnosed with post-mortem especially veterans playing late into their careers.

Jason Kelce admitted he believes he has CTE following his dazzling 13-year career in the NFL

The Philadelphia Eagles legend claimed he can almost guarantee he suffers with the disease

Kelce's bold claims came after he suggested racehorse Secretariat cheated

'[Y]ou know who else makes unsubstantiated claims not backed up by facts. People suffering from CTE. I'll admit I don't know whether @JasonKelce suffers from CTE or not it's impossible to know' they posted.

Kelce surprisingly responded to the dig by suggesting that he more than likely does suffer with the brain disease.

'I mean I can virtually guarantee that I have CTE all the research would suggest I have some degree of it' he replied. 'I think it is entirely reasonable to assume I have some degree of that pathology.'

The social media user later insisted he didn't mean to cause any offense but an unbothered Kelce brushed it off saying it was just the reality he faces.

'I understand I don't take offense at all. what I’m saying is that it’s completely reasonable to think I have CTE' he added.

'Even though there is no test to see if I currently have CTE The evidence suggests I probably do. Just like the reality that a lot if not most of the high level horses of the 70s and 80s were doping because adequate tests were not available.

'But it really doesn’t accomplish anything to bring this up I don’t know why I started Secretariat was still a fantastic horse and legendary specimen.'

An unbothered Kelce brushed it off saying it was just the reality he faces

Former NFL wide receiver Antonio Brown unsurprisingly had a less-than-sensitive response to Kelce's admission.

Brown who has become an internet provocateur attacking the likes of Tom Brady and Caitlin Clark online has repeatedly joked about having CTE on X.

The controversial former NFL star has even created a social media page known as CTESPN in order to mock the original ESPN network

Brown quote-tweeted a post reporting Kelce's claim writing: 'First step is admitting it. #CTESPN.'

Kelce was also concerned over the impact of CTE towards the end of his career the Philadelphia Inquirer's Marcus Hayes reported following the end of the Eagles' 2023 season and just weeks before the veteran announced his retirement.

He reportedly struggled to remember the date of a teammate's injury and quipped that it was 'the CTE creeping in'.

Antonio Brown unsurprisingly had a less-than-sensitive response to Kelce's admission

The former NFL wide receiver has repeatedly joked about having CTE on social media

Kelce previously expressed his concerns about the impacts of CTE during his Amazon Prime documentary last year.

'There have been little things that are not big things yet but are going to turn into big things the longer I play' he said.

'Not to dress like an elephant in the NFL room but I am fearful about what the impacts of playing football are going to mean long-term. I have two girls and ... some people end up getting CTE and some guys live long healthy lives.

'I have no idea what's going to happen with that because I've thought about this' he said thinking of the amount of physical impacts in the game and if 'it might come back to bite me.'",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL3NhbmZyYW5jaXNjby9uZXdzL3N0YXJ2aW5nLWJyb3duLXBlbGljYW5zLW92ZXJ3aGVsbS1iaXJkLXJlc2N1ZS1mYWNpbGl0eS1mYWlyZmllbGQv0gFvaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2JzbmV3cy5jb20vYW1wL3NhbmZyYW5jaXNjby9uZXdzL3N0YXJ2aW5nLWJyb3duLXBlbGljYW5zLW92ZXJ3aGVsbS1iaXJkLXJlc2N1ZS1mYWNpbGl0eS1mYWlyZmllbGQv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Starving brown pelicans overwhelm bird rescue facility in Fairfield,"FAIRFIELD -- A wildlife crisis is playing out in the Bay Area and along the California coast. Thousands of brown pelicans are starving to death and scientists don't seem to know why. Now one local rescue center is desperately appealing to the public for help.

On Saturday a public open house at the International Bird Rescue Center in Fairfield almost didn't happen but they decided to go through with it anyway because they thought it was important for the public to understand the crisis they're dealing with. The rescue center is accustomed to dealing with injured or sick birds but what began slowly in April has suddenly become overwhelming.

""We were all going back and forth like 'Is this a thing is this not a thing?' And then in the last four or five days things have just cratered"" said the center's fevelopment director Alex Domeyko. ""The number of pelicans we've taken in in the last week or so has doubled.""

""For the first time in ten years this is the most pelicans I've ever seen here so it's quite unusual"" said wildlife center manager Kelly Beffa.

Brown pelicans are the birds you see at the beach skimming over the water in formation like a squadron of fighter planes. Lately they've been found wandering in unusual places unable to fly away from people.

""One bird that we actually have in care right now came in from Santa Cruz and it tried to walk into a bar right near the boardwalk. So these birds are disoriented"" said spokesperson Russ Curtis.

They're not sick they're starving. For some reason that remains a mystery the birds cannot find the fish they need to survive. They eat the same diet as other birds but it is only the pelicans that are being brought in by the dozens.

""One of the things that we'll be relying on is ocean scientists and avian folks to figure out why this fishing stock is eluding them"" Curtis said.

""Some of them are coming in less than half of the body weight that they're supposed to be"" said Beffa as she examined a new arrival. ""So imagine a human going through that. You're supposed to weigh 150 pounds you're coming in at 75 pounds. You're going to be having some severe problems.""

The rescue center currently has 120 pelicans and is expecting another 30 to 40 in a few days. As a result the operation is facing a crisis of its own.

""Right now we're going through 500 pounds of fish a day"" said Curtis. ""That's about $1000 a day so you can start to multiply that out.""

The birds respond well to the food and vitamins they're getting but they can't be released into the wild until there is a food supply for them. It's putting a major drain on the center's finances so they're asking for help -- donations to help pay for food and volunteers to help care for so many patients.

""I mean especially for crises like this where we take in this many birds we need as many hands on deck as we can get"" Domeyko said. ""And volunteers are the backbone of this organization.""

No one knows for sure why this is happening or when it might end. Pelicans burn a lot of calories and can die within days with no food. The fear is for each of the birds that have been captured and saved many more have already perished in the wild.

The center says any pelican found acting strangely should be reported immediately to local animal control.

The shades you choose may determine how you apply your balm but Brown cleared the air by saying you can really put it wherever you want. For a natural full-face routine however you can use one from each category—a tint to start a blush on the cheeks and lips and a highlight on cheekbones. If you have oily skin Brown recommended putting your balms of choice over a light veil of loose powder. On the flip side they float effortlessly over and hydrate dry mature skin. “I’m in my mid-60s I don’t know what I would do without this product” she said."

The brand owned by beverage giant Brown-Forman (Jack Daniel’s Old Forester) was created in the 1990s and is well-regarded for its bourbon in particular but also rye wheat and malt whiskeys. Master distiller Chris Morris and assistant master distiller Elizabeth McCall take great pride in these expressions touting the “five sources of flavor” that go into the Woodford profile. But they also like to spread their creative wings a bit and the Master’s Collection offers that opportunity. The brand-new Five-Malt Stouted Mash is the 17th release in the series and requires some explanation.

The inspiration for this malt whiskey came from two things according to the brand. First there’s Woodford’s peripheral Irish ties namely that the original distillery on the site was made by Irish stonemasons back in the early 1800s and the fact that the whiskey is distilled onsite in triple pot stills like Irish whiskey (whiskey is also distilled in column stills at Brown-Forman’s Shively location). Second American whiskey is made from what is known as distiller’s beer which is the mash of fermented grains that is subsequently distilled into a spirit and then aged in barrels. So this all brings us to this singular new release that has more in common with other beer-adjacent craft whiskies than anything you’ve tried from Woodford before.

The nose is full of dark fruits espresso and chocolate notes with an underlying maltiness. Take a sip and the palate expands into rich toasted nut and cocoa notes with some caramel banana and as expected from the name rich dark stout beer flavors. This comes from the five malts used in the mash bill for this whiskey—Distillers Malt Wheat Malt Pale Chocolate Malt Carafa 1 Malt and Kiln Coffee Malt. While the proportions are not revealed Woodford reps say the percentages of these malts range from 70 percent to just over one percent in the mash bill depending on impact on the flavor (“For some of the malts used a little goes a long way”).

WATCH

The result is a remarkably stout-like whiskey but minus the hoppy notes you’ll find in some others of this ilk. This is a whiskey for the nerds the fans who really want to break out of the mold and explore different flavor profiles. At 90.4 proof just like the original bourbon there is a touch of heat but it’s subtle not aggressive. This is a sipper not a mixer and may take some time getting comfortable with but it’s definitely worth a taste if you can find a bottle. It looks like it’s already going for well above its $130 asking price but give it a spin and see what you think. You won’t be reaching for this every time you want to wet your whistle but it’s a nice choice when you feel like branching out.

Shirley Caesar's music is beloved by many and she considers it a cornerstone of her ministry. So when a portion of her ""Hold My Mule"" performance went viral back in 2016 she was happy to reach millennials with her message of faith.

While her mention in the song of ""beans greens potatoes tomatoes"" and more menu items for Thanksgiving sparked a popular meme she told us at the time ""I didn't understand it. And still don't understand it. I have not been able to wrap my mind about what's going on. It is so huge!""

Now it's about to really blow up thanks to a creative IT expert's light show in Texas. On the day we shared it with her at her home she said ""God has given me a brand new audience from this 'beans and greens.' So I have little children just twirling and shaking and stuff!""

She was aware that hundreds of versions featuring a remix of her words are posted on Instagram including ""What's the guy's name? Snoop Dogg! He did something. Some of the others did it. Thank you thank you thank you!""

Then she watched the Christmas light show created by Frankie Toong that decorates his Houston home and includes not just the sound but the actual words spelled out for passersby to enjoy. She was not aware of that one before we showed her and giggled as she checked it out on an iPhone.

""Wow! That's phenomenal! I think it's awesome"" she said laughing.

Toong reached in Houston via Zoom didn't know she had seen his creativity ""And the hilarious comments that come from it like 'Oh that's just what I'm bringing to your house!' And 'I need those lights but I also need those sides!' So it's been a real hit.""

Now after watching her reaction to his work on Instagram where he's posting as @htown_frankie he said ""Just seeing her bob her head to her own music and my Christmas lights and enjoying the video that's exactly the response I'm looking to get. That's outstanding! I hope she can utilize that in any capacity that she wishes and if she has any requests I'd be willing to take whatever else she'd like me to do. Maybe I can help her out to spread some more cheer!""

Linked online this year without ever meeting face to face they both appreciate how the virtual merging of their talents helps to make this year's Christmas season brighter.

""When it became viral I said wow. I didn't know what was going on"" she said. ""But God! That's about it really!""

I was four years old it was 1996 and my parents had just driven myself my brother and my grandma (Magaw as we called her) from the Texas panhandle to the Las Vegas Strip to celebrate Christmas in style.

We weren't staying at The Mirage.

In fact we were on the far end of the Strip at the MGM Grand but I can still remember if just for a fleeting second how magical it felt to enter that larger-than-life space. Above me the glass atrium felt like a spaceship people from all walks of life floated by in every direction slot machines were dinging and rattling coins were jingling in large plastic buckets and as far as the pictures show — I was enthralled.

But the thing I remember the most were the fish a giant wall of them full of more shapes colors and designs than any little boy from rural cotton-growing ""Friday Night Lights"" West Texas had ever seen. That was the moment when I fell in love with The Mirage — and hotels as a whole.

Now flash forward a quarter of a century and my love for The Mirage hasn't changed. Though I may have ditched my stroller and OshKosh B'gosh overalls every time I visit Las Vegas it's essential for me to walk under that big glass dome and say hi to those fish though now it's usually while I'm in line to check in to the hotel instead of gawking from a distance.

When The Mirage opened its doors for the first time back in 1989 three years before I came into existence it changed the world — at least the hotel world.

Set on 77 acres Las Vegas mogul Steve Wynn set out to build a megaresort. And he did. At the time it was the largest hotel on the planet and it redefined what a resort could with its sprawling size seemingly endless dining options toned down but visible theme (technically Polynesian in case you were wondering) and overall sense of luxury.

It also opened up Las Vegas as a family-friendly destination thanks to its over-the-top erupting volcano Siegfried & Roy's magic show featuring white tigers and the chance to temporarily escape the mundaneness of everyday life to feel like you and your family entered a tropical paradise hidden in the middle of the Nevada desert. A mirage if you will.

Since that first trip to Las Vegas back when my wallet (also OshKosh) only held a library card I've returned countless times. And in a way over the years it feels like I've grown up with The Mirage which became an MGM property in 2000 and was just acquired by Hard Rock International.

On those earlier trips (mostly work trips my parents let me tag along on) we'd slip into The Mirage for a buffet free-for-all or step out on the Strip to watch the volcano. My parents would usually let me pick out a slot machine that ""felt right"" and one would play $5 while the other stood back with me on the kid-designated carpet.

The summer before my senior year of high school my relationship with The Mirage ascended to a whole new level. My mom booked a massive suite to stay in for a work trip and let me invite a friend. Over the course of a long weekend we lounged in the dry summer heat by the pool drank Dr Pepper from champagne glasses saw ""The Beatles LOVE"" by Cirque du Soleil and generally acted like we owned the place. It was a great story to tell our friends back in the sleepy town of Levelland Texas.

Before I knew it I was 21 and my wallet — now Coach maybe American Eagle — had my driver's license my college ID and an MGM player's card. Then I was drinking Champagne from a champagne glass and feeling too scared to sit down at a blackjack table. I'd spend hours playing penny slots with my dad my mom anchored down at a craps table.

It was at The Mirage the first time I won big — $800 on an Ellen-themed slot machine. And it was Howie Mandle's voice at the Deal or No Deal machine tucked away between the bathroom and the ticket office that frequently convinced me to say ""no deal"" sometimes for better and sometimes for worse.

For Christmas of 2019 my family shared a suite at The Mirage the last time we'd see each other for more than 15 months due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It was the silly memories of 2 a.m. steak and eggs me still trying to learn to play craps from my mom and everyone recounting their antics the next morning that held me through that long separation.

And then just this month we evolved again. Celebrating my best friend's 30th birthday 15 friends gathered yet again in a two-bedroom suite on top of The Mirage. This time I saw my favorite casino through the blurry lens of old college friends celebrating the privilege of getting older.

We danced with cowboys in the sportsbook to a live country band; we scouted out the machines that ""felt right"" just like my parents taught me; and we had a moment when we looked around and realized how weird it was that we'd all ""grown up.""

Mostly we talked about how annoying it was that I knew every nook and cranny across the resort's 77 acres.

Soon we'll say goodbye to The Mirage and hello to the Hard Rock Las Vegas. The volcano will have one more triumphant explosion and then be paved over to build a larger-than-life building in the shape of a guitar.

After that who knows what next? I don't even know what's next for me. We've aged and we've changed — and we'll change again. But what won't change and I'm certain of it are the memories I made over the years in the hotel that will always feel like my hotel.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3N0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvZGVjLzI0L2hvbGlkYXktc25vdy1jb21lcy1mb3Itb25lLWNhcGl0YWwtY2l0eS1mYW1pbHkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Holiday snow comes for one Capital City family,"Christmas came early for one Jefferson City family.

Jefferson City Parks Recreation and Forestry staff transported a dump truck full of snow to the Volmert family home.

Every year the department selects one winner to receive a “Guaranteed White Christmas.” Crews deliver a truck full of shavings from the Washington Park Ice Arena in the days leading up to Christmas.

Sydney Volmert entered for her younger brother Jesse who was selected as the winner Wednesday.

Their mom Kelly Volmert said she met with parks staff Wednesday to talk about where would be best to empty the truck.

Also when the family found out she said they started calling friends to come play in the snow too.

Come Thursday morning a gaggle of adults and children gathered outside the family home. They waited with coats and gloves on snow shovels and sleds at the ready until the truck dumped its load and moved out of the way.

Then Sydney and Jesse along with several of their friends hopped right into a snowball fight.

“It’s been tons of fun” Kelly said. “The kids are out of school this week … so they haven’t gotten to see their friends much. This was a great opportunity for us to call up some friends and say ‘Hey you want to come over and play in the snow when no one else is?’ I think they’re having a great time.”

Phil Stiles program manager of special events for Parks said the tradition started about 30 years ago as a way to promote the ice arena.

The winner also gets a private rental session at the ice arena with catered lunch.

""It seems like everybody that comes from here knows how to blow a duck call"" the 48-year-old call maker said.

Stephens is a world duck calling champion who grew up on a rice farm near Stuttgart long known as the ""Rice and Duck Capital of the World.""

A town of about 10000 residents Stuttgart is a six-hour drive from Oklahoma City and is hallowed ground to duck hunters. Mallards have been flocking to the rice fields and bottomland forests around Stuttgart for many many years.

That plus the maze of rivers bayous sloughs and oxbow lakes make Stuttgart located 45 miles southeast of Little Rock a magnet for ducks.

""We have a lot of hardwood bottoms around here that flood naturally"" Stephens said. ""It's just kind of a natural funnel where ducks come for wintering grounds.""

And it's wintering grounds for duck hunters from across the country.

A mecca for duck hunting

The flooded timber of the Bayou Meto Wildlife Management Area about 15 miles southwest of Stuttgart is considered the crown jewel of public lands for waterfowl hunting.

The opening days of waterfowl season can get crowded at Bayou Meto even with its 33832 acres.

Between 1500 to 2000 hunters use the area each day in the early days of duck season and about 350 hunters use the area daily the rest of the season.

Thirty-five miles southeast of Stuttgart is the White River National Wildlife Refuge home to the largest concentration of wintering mallard ducks in the Mississippi Flyway.

Across the Delta region of southeast Arkansas near the confluence of the White Arkansas and Mississippi rivers there are duck hunting opportunities galore when there is adequate rainfall to flood the public hunting areas along the river bottoms.

""This is a very dry year for us and we don't have quite the public land available because it's not flooded"" Stephens said. ""But on a normal year that's what I think brings a lot of people here. You can just put a boat in and go somewhere and hunt.""

Last weekend Stephens met duck hunters from Florida Maine North Carolina Montana Oklahoma and Texas in Stuttgart. In addition to mallards hunting speckled-belly geese has become extremely popular in recent years he said.

""There's a lot of good hunting in Stuttgart for sure"" Stephens said.

Stuttgart is Ducktown

The town of Stuttgart embraces all things duck and duck hunting during and outside of waterfowl season.

""That's one of the cool things about Stuttgart"" Stephens said. ""It's kind of duck season 365 days a year. Everything is just centered around the rice harvest and the fall migration of ducks""

There are numerous of duck hunting guides operating in Stuttgart. It is home to the world duck calling championships each Thanksgiving weekend.

Mack's Prairie Wings which advertises itself as America's Premier Waterfowl Outfitter calls Stuttgart home.

Down the road from Mack's is Rich-N-Tone Calls (also called RNT Calls) one of the largest duck call manufacturers in the world. Stephens is RNT's president and chief executive officer.

And his journey to the top of the call making world began when he was a young boy in Stuttgart.

A community of call makers

Stephens first went duck hunting with his dad at age 5.

""I don't remember a whole lot about it but I remember when I got to be the age of 6 or 7 they gave me a duck call to blow when we were sitting out in a blind"" he said. ""I was just making a bunch of racket really.""

A duck flew in and the hunters shot it. Stephens said there is no way that duck could have been responding to the noise he was making but it hooked him on duck calling.

In Stuttgart there was a community of call makers and a young Stephens would be a frequent visitor to watch them work and pick their brains.

""There were probably a dozen call makers in this town"" Stephens said.

One of the best was a local craftsman named Butch Richenback who won a world duck calling championship in 1972 and was the 1975 Champion of Champions caller.

In 1976 Richenback started Rich-N-Tone duck calls. In the beginning making duck calls was more of a hobby and not a full-time job for Richenback Stephens said.

""I grew up going over to his little shop in his garage learning how to blow a duck call"" Stephens said. ""And that is where I got interested in making calls.""

More than 20 years later when Richenback began having health issues he began looking to sell the company. Richenback could have sold Rich-N-Tone to a larger company but he asked Stephens whom he had mentored as a boy to buy it.

Stephens was working as a landscape architect at the time and was reluctant about taking over for a legend but he bought the company in 1999.

The Flying Duck tap room

Today Rich-N-Tone is one of the top sellers of duck calls in the world and the company has its own duck hunting show on the Sportsman Channel. Stephens is one of three co-hosts.

Rich-N-Tone calls are machine-built then finished by hand and tuned but Stephens also has his own brand of custom-made calls that he still makes by hand. The Rich-N-Tone calls sell from $65 to $200 while Stephens' custom calls start around $500.

Visitors to Rich-N-Tone's headquarters in Stuttgart can view how the calls are made. They can also see a collection of vintage duck calls.

In addition to being a call maker Stephens is a call collector. He displays old duck calls from different collectors around the country at his store and manufacturing facility in Stuttgart.""Right now we have a duck call collection from Tennessee"" he said. ""It's over 200 calls dating back from 1880 to 1950. We get a lot of people that come through to see the calls and get a beer.""

That's because three years ago Stephens also added a tap room for craft beer at Rich-N-Tone. The company's flagship beer is the ""Flying Duck.""

Rich-N-Tone partnered with Flyway Brewing in Little Rock to make the ""Flying Duck"" beer which is sold in Harps Food Stores and liquor stores across Arkansas and Oklahoma.

The Flying Duck tap room gets crowded during duck season.

""During duck season we are packed"" Stephens said of the tap room. ""It's cool because you don't go to too many places where the whole place is filled with duck hunters.""

""This is a vaccinated cruise and all guests were also tested before embarkation"" Carnival told FOX Business in a statement on Friday. ""Unfortunately Bonaire and Aruba authorities did not permit the ship to call in those ports but we have confirmed a visit to Amber Cove [Dominican Republic] today.""

For its vaccinated cruises Carnival requires guests to have received their final dose of a coronavirus vaccine at least 14 days prior to sailing and to provide proof of vaccination. Under CDC guidelines all vaccinated guests age two and over must also present a negative COVID-19 test taken within two days of boarding.

WHAT TO KNOW WHEN TAKING A CRUISE AS COVID-19 CASES RISE

Despite the change in course the cruise line said the Carnival Freedom is still expected to arrive in Miami Sunday as planned.

Carnival did not disclose how many people onboard the Carnival Freedom tested positive but competitor Royal Caribbean had two coronavirus outbreaks on ships out of South Florida over the past week.

On Thursday Royal Caribbean's Odyssey of the Seas was denied entry at the ports of Curacao and Aruba after 55 fully-vaccinated passengers and crew tested positive for the virus representing 1.1% of the people on the ship.

On Saturday Royal Caribbean's Symphony of the Seas ship had at least 48 passengers and crew — out of a passenger and crew load of more than 6000 — test positive for COVID-19 when it returned to dock in Miami.

Royal Caribbean requires all passengers age 12 and older to be fully vaccinated two weeks prior to sailing and encourages but does not require boosters. The cruise line's entire cruise ship staff is fully vaccinated and undergoes weekly testing.

FOX Business' Lucas Manfredi and Daniella Genovese contributed to this report.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vdHJhdmVsL2FydGljbGUvY2Fybml2YWwtZnJlZWRvbS1jcnVpc2Utc2hpcC1jb3ZpZC9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFJaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vdHJhdmVsL2FydGljbGUvY2Fybml2YWwtZnJlZWRvbS1jcnVpc2Utc2hpcC1jb3ZpZA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Carnival cruise ship with ‘small number’ of Covid-19 cases books a new port after being denied entry to 2,"CNN —

A Carnival cruise ship that departed Miami has “a small number” of people aboard who have tested positive for Covid-19 and it has been denied entry to ports at two Caribbean islands the cruise line said.

However the Carnival Freedom ship was granted access to visit Amber Cove in the Dominican Republic company spokesperson AnneMarie Mathews said in a prepared statement.

“Carnival Freedom is following all protocols and has a small number on board who are in isolation due to a positive Covid test” Mathews’ statement reads.

“Our protocols anticipate this possibility and we implement them as necessary to protect the health and safety of our guests and crew. This is a vaccinated cruise and all guests were also tested before embarkation” the statement reads.

The Carnival Freedom departed Miami on December 18 and stopped in Curacao on Tuesday. Its planned stops at the Caribbean islands of Bonaire on Wednesday and Aruba on Thursday were canceled.

Those stops were replaced by Friday’s stop in the Dominican Republic and the ship will return to Miami as planned on Sunday the cruise line said.

The ship’s entry into Curacao was also delayed due to the Covid-19 cases detected onboard.

Dr. Izzy Gerstenbluth the national epidemiologist for Curacao told CNN that he was alerted by the ship prior to its docking that it had crew members who tested positive for Covid-19.

Gerstenbluth wanted to assess the situation once the ship docked but he said he was delayed due to an emergency on the island. Once Gerstenbluth arrived on the cruise ship he determined the cases were contained among the crew he explained. Curacao allowed the ship’s passengers to leave the ship but the crew remained onboard he said.

Ashley Peterson a passenger aboard on the cruise told CNN the cruise line refused to inform her why the ship was delayed entry into Curacao. Later that day she learned from a news report the delay was triggered by Covid-19 infections she said.

Peterson said it wasn’t until the next day when the ship was denied entry into Bonaire that passengers were officially informed of the Covid-19 cases and said she may have taken a flight back to North Carolina if she knew of the positive cases.

When asked by CNN Carnival Cruise Line did not address specific claims by Peterson.

Carnival and many other cruise lines require passengers to be fully vaccinated against Covid-19 with some exceptions for children.

The cruise line is working closely with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and local health authorities at the destination it visits according to the statement.

“The rapid spread of the Omicron variant may shape how some destination authorities view even a small number of cases even when they are being managed with our vigorous protocols” Mathews’ statement reads. “Some destinations have limited medical resources and are focused on managing their own local response to the variant.

“Should it be necessary to cancel a port we will do our best to find an alternative destination.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vY3J1aXNlcmFkaW8ubmV0L2Nhcm5pdmFscy1uZXh0LW1lZ2EtY3J1aXNlLXNoaXAtcmVjZWl2ZXMtZnVubmVsLXBob3Rvcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Carnival's Next Mega Cruise Ship Receives Funnel [PHOTOS],"Construction on Carnival Cruise Line’s second Excel-class ship Carnival Celebration is well underway.

Over the weekend Carnival’s brand ambassador John Heald posted photos on Facebook of the vessel’s “whale tail” funnel being lowered onto the ship’s top deck. “Carnival Celebration getting her whale tail. Big fun coming next year” he wrote.

Carnival Celebration is the sister-ship to Carnival Cruise Line’s largest ship to date — Mardi Gras. After a number of delays Mardi Gras set sail on her first passenger cruise in July 2021.

Carnival Celebration is set to debut in November 2022 in Miami. Her first cruise will be from the UK to Miami in early November 2022.

Carnival Celebration will feature most of the same amenities and activities that can be found on Mardi Gras such as the top-deck BOLT roller coaster the Serenity adults-only retreat WaterWorks aqua park the two-story RedFrog Tiki Bar and the Cloud 9 Spa with a thermal suite.

Dining onboard will include Guy’s Pig & Anchor Smokehouse | Brewhouse Seafood Shack Bonsai Teppanyaki Chibang! Fahrenheit 555 Steakhouse BlueIguana Cantina and Guy’s Burger Joint.

The vessels in Carnival’s new Excel-class have all been named after previous Carnival ships.

Mardi Gras’ namesake was Carnival’s very first ship which entered into service with Carnival in 1972. She was built in 1961 and sailed for Canadian Pacific Steamships Ltd. as the Empress of Canada until she was bought by Carnival and renamed Mardi Gras.

Carnival Celebration is named after Carnival’s 1987-built Celebration which was the final vessel in the line’s Holiday-class. Carnival sold Celebration in 2008 and the ship continued to sail until the global pandemic shut down cruising in March 2020. She has since been scrapped.

A third Excel-class vessel set to debut in 2023 Carnival Jubilee has been named after the 1986-built Jubilee which sailed with Carnival until 2004.

With the growing concern of Omicron on cruises and at ports Carnival Cruise Line has started to send a pre-cruise update to guests letting them know all the latest changes and the current situation. It comes as some cruise ships including the Carnival Freedom recently refused entry to some Caribbean ports due to positive cases on board.

Carnival reminds guests of the updated mask policy currently in effect with masks required indoors at all times except when drinking and eating and when in the stateroom. Masks are also required outdoors when social distancing is not possible and when in large gatherings.

Even though there was an update to the mask policy on December 17 there was another update on December 23. Carnival also advises guests to have higher graded masks such as the surgical or KN95.

Warning on On Board Cases and Denied at Ports

The cruise line warns guests that it’s now possible there could be COVID cases on board despite having protocols in place due to the Omicron variant.

The letter says “But even with these measures and other stringent COVID-19 protocols we have in place it is possible we will have some positive cases during your cruise given the prevalence of the Omicron Variant. Should that happen we are prepared to actively manage the situation protect guest and crew health and operate your cruise.”

You can read the full letter below:

The cruise ports are trying to protect citizens and those on board resulting in some destinations recently denying ships such as Carnival Freedom at Bonaire and Aruba and Carnival Panorama at Cabo San Lucas. It’s been the same case with Royal Caribbean with Odyssey of the Seas and Explorer of the Seas both recently denied at ports.

Carnival says in the letter “We are working closely with local health authorities in all ports on your cruise itinerary. Unfortunately the rapid spread of the Omicron Variant may shape how they view even a small number of cases even when they are being managed with our rigorous protocols.”

The letter continues with “We want you to know that we may encounter a decision by local authorities at a destination to limit or deny the ship from entering the port. Some destinations have limited medical resources and are focused on managing their own local response to the variant.“

“Should it be necessary to cancel a port we will do our best to find an alternative destination. However if we are unsuccessful in doing so there will be no compensation for a missed port beyond a refund of any pre-purchased Carnival shore excursions.”

The cruise line clarifies that these situations could continue to be an issue with cases on board and ships being denied or limited. If a Carnival cruise ship is denied and there is no alternative port guests are told not to expect any compensation such as onboard credit.

Think again!

Even though it doesn’t have the same cultural significance as the West young Chinese are jumping to engage with Christmas themes such as Santa Claus.

The implication? Your Western marketing strategy for Christmas can be adapted for China!

Discover some Christmas marketing trends in China and how western brands have incorporated these themes into their Chinese marketing below.

Celebrating Christmas in China

Christmas has been making a comeback in China and looks very different from Western customs. As with other Chinese festivals Christmas is an opportunity for younger generations of Chinese to take a break from the stresses of their daily life and look after themselves. The now illegal ‘996 working culture’ a practice where people work from 9am to 9pm six days a week continues to impact young Chinese inducing stress and huge pressure. Christmas is a great opportunity for brands to tap into this trend validating consumers’ experiences in their product messaging and encouraging purchase or gifting of products that relieve stress. In fact data from Mintel revealed 63% of 20 to 24 year olds admit spending money to alleviate pressure and stress

These festive themes are especially popular with young Chinese women meaning a generation of young men are annually coerced into purchasing gifts! More than 40% of male respondents reported spending 1000+ yuan last Christmas and at a higher proportion than women reflecting the growing expectation of expressing love through Christmas gifting. Focusing on helping male consumers to purchase a suitable gift could prove a lucrative strategy for western brands!

Let’s take a look at how some Western brands have successfully executed Christmas campaigns in China.

The 7-Up Christmas Mojito - An opportunity to escape the pressure of daily life

Understanding the needs of China’s youngest generations was the key to resonating for 7-Up. Creating a party atmosphere to allow Gen-Z followers to blow-off steam and escape day-to-day pressures resulted in an iconic campaign that will be fondly remembered by China’s Gen Z for years to come.

From a Christmas Mojito drink to creative filters on Douyin of antlers fairy wands and winter scenes to sharing alcoholic drink recipes using 7-Up products - everything in this campaign encouraged followers to join in the fun! KOLs also got involved vlogging making the recipes themselves and to top off all the online buzz 7-Up launched their Christmas ‘Drunk’ Tavern – a pop-up bringing a fully immersive experience of the 7-Up brand to young Chinese!

KFC is the key to Christmas - anchoring the brand in the festive season

To win over China’s GenZ it’s vital to fully immerse them in the brand and get their buy-in to the vibe of the brand. More than any other generation huge importance is placed on the ambiance the brands build i.e. buying Christmas products just to feel ‘Christmassy’ rather than needing the products themselves.

KFC have this tactic nailed – creating a ritual of going to KFC to celebrate Christmas! In 2019 KFC China invited a group of officially trained Finnish “Santa Clauses” to travel to six cities in China tasting the KFC Christmas breakfast items and going sightseeing gaining much attention and popularity on social media. Their hashtag “as long as you believe” has been read 100 million timer with high volumes of discussion from young netizens and continues to attract traffic for KFC's ongoing Christmas marketing activities making KFC essential for Christmas in China.

This wider trend - growth in festival-based consumption

Chinese consumers are becoming more accustomed to expressing emotions through consumption during festivals with specific celebration activities and objects. By understanding users experiences’ even foreign festivals can be a huge source of enthusiasm for Chinese consumers’. Brands can create their own common ground with audiences and integrate traditions invented by marketeers into their audiences’ lives resonating well beyond the initial campaign.

This emotional resonance is not the same as the emotion-driven Christmas marketing seen in the West such as the iconic John Lewis Christmas ads interpreting family values and traditional customs for modern life. In China younger people just want to celebrate and treat themselves relieving the stresses of everyday life. Brands that can address these emotional needs in Christmas advertising can build a long lasting relationship with Chinese audiences as they have a more authentic voice in Christmas advertising then a native Chinese brand would. It also helps that the timing of Western festivals avoids traditional Chinese festivals providing consumers additional reasons to celebrate. For brands wishing to invest in a lifelong connection with Chinese audiences this is the way to go.

Here's What You Need To Remember: In 1996 a group of PLA officers including intelligence chief Gen. Ji Shengde approached Xu Zengping a former PLA basketball star who had become a successful businessman arranging international events. The cabal’s proposal: to have Xu purchase the carrier as a private citizen ostensibly to serve as a casino so as to avoid undesirable scrutiny.

China was proud to launch its first aircraft carrier the Liaoning in 2012. This vessel was a refit of an incomplete Soviet Kuznetsov-class cruiser carrier. However the story of how China got that ship in the first place may as well be a comedy—because the carrier was actually a rogue acquisition for the Chinese military against the wishes of the government in Beijing. And it was undertaken by a basketball player who claimed he wanted to build a floating casino.

The People's Liberation Army Navy first became interested in acquiring an aircraft carrier in 1970 when China was still on bad terms with both the Soviet Union and the United States. However few concrete steps were taken because the cost and complexity of such an endeavor far exceeded the PLAN’s limited capabilities during the Cold War.

The Soviet Navy did deploy its first carriers in the 1970s: Kiev-class vessels that could launch Yak-38 Forger jump jets of limited effectiveness. By the 1980s the Soviets began construction of two more promising Kuznetsov-class carriers. These had a “ski jump” ramp allowing more conventional—and much higher-performing—Su-33 Flanker fighters to take off from it. Like the earlier Kiev class the Kuznetsov was technically an “aircraft-carrying cruiser” due its powerful armament of twelve P-700 Granit antiship missile systems. This technicality was important as “aircraft carriers” proper weighing more than fifteen thousand tons (which is to say virtually all aircraft carriers today) were not legally permitted by the Montreux Convention to transit from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean via the Bosporus Straits.

However the fall of the Soviet Union left the second vessel in its class the Varyag only two-thirds complete in Ukraine lacking its armament and electrical systems. Construction ceased in 1992 and the cash-strapped Ukrainian government did its best to pawn off the fifty-five thousand tons of inoperable metal rusting in its Mykolaiv shipyard. Russia India and China all passed.

A two-part series in the South China Morning Post in 2015 revealed the machinations behind how the carrier ended up in Chinese service anyway two decades later. It turns out the PLA Navy did want the Varyag—the team sent to inspect it recommended purchasing it! But the government in Beijing was worried that acquiring a carrier might increase tensions at a time when it was seeking to further open itself to Western investors.

Instead in 1996 a group of PLA officers including intelligence chief Gen. Ji Shengde approached Xu Zengping a former PLA basketball star who had become a successful businessman arranging international events. The cabal’s proposal: to have Xu purchase the carrier as a private citizen ostensibly to serve as a casino so as to avoid undesirable scrutiny. Then the PLAN could collect it for its own use once the political winds were more favorable.

This cover story is not as ridiculous as it sounds. Remember those Kiev-class carriers mentioned earlier? Two of them are now moored in China serving as amusement parks. The Minsk was actually purchased by a consortium of video-game arcade owners in Shenzhen for $4.4 million and has since been moved to Nantong north of Shanghai. And the original Kiev? Now a floating hotel in Tianjin. However the more modern Kuznetsov-class Varyag was undoubtedly of much greater practical interest for the PLAN than either of those ships.

Xu was down with the scheme and borrowed the equivalent of $30 million in Hong Kong dollars from a friend to help fund the venture—the first expense of which was to create a $6 million shell company in Macau called Agência Turística e Diversões Chong Lot Limitada in order to maintain the fiction. (Macau was still in its last years as a Portuguese colony at the time.)

In January 1998 Xu arrived in Ukraine and met with the shipyard owners. After four days of negotiations in which enormous bribes were offered and fifty bottles of 124-proof baijiu liquor were consumed he reached an agreement to purchase the carrier for $20 million—well below the cost of a single jet fighter today. He wasn’t able to make the payment until a year later with a $10 million extra late fee tacked on.

Some international observers smelled something fishy in the arrangement—Xu’s company did not actually have a gambling permit in Macau nor a listed phone number or address. Ironically however a Jane’s analyst interviewed by the Washington Post at the time stated it was “farfetched” that the PLA Navy would try to operate the Varyag due to its decrepit and incomplete condition.

By June 2000 everything was ready to go. The carrier’s four engines were packed in grease seals (they had yet to be installed) several tons of blueprints were sent overland to China by truck and a Dutch towing company was ready to tug the 306-meter-long vessel all the way back to China. What could go wrong?

Ever been stunned by the towing fee after your car breaks down far from home? Imagine that but around five hundred times worse. Why five hundred? Because that equals the roughly five hundred days the Liaoning was stuck being towed in circles off Istanbul after the Turkish government denied it passage to the Mediterranean via the Bosporus Straits.

The Turkish maritime minister argued that should there be a mishap towing the 306-meter-long carrier—which could not maneuver or move on its own power—it might spin around and block the Bosporus straits to all shipping or run into one of the bridges connecting the two halves of Istanbul. The straits are only seven hundred meters wide at their narrowest point and require at least six major course corrections to navigate. Hundreds of ships had suffered accidents there in the past. Curiously the Chinese appear to have perceived the Turkish refusal to be in retaliation for China’s opposition to the NATO air campaign in Yugoslavia the previous year.

The Liaoning spent sixteen months racking up $8500 a day in towing fees. Finally Beijing had a change of heart on the matter and stepped in on August 2001 promising major concessions on tourism to persuade the Turks to let the Varyag pass.

Finally on November 1 in an operation involving more than two dozens tug and emergency vessels the Varyag was towed through the Bosporus without incident and traversed the Dardanelles the next day. The hard part was over.

Except for the sea storm with sixty-mile-per-hour winds that struck the rudderless vessel off the island of Skyros two days later causing it to snap its tow lines. It took two more days to recover the runaway carrier. Tragically a Portuguese sailor fell to his death while helping reconnect it to its tugs.

Once under power a normal vessel could have taken the shortcut through the Suez Canal and straight on back to China via the Indian Ocean. But the canal would not accept powerless vessels such as the Varyag so it had to cruise all the way around Africa Vasco de Gama–style chugging along at a brisk jog of seven miles per hour.

In March 2002 the carrier finally arrived at the port of Dalian in Liaoning province which would lend the carrier its name in Chinese service. Three years later it was put into a dry dock to allow for an extensive refit process including sandblasting away all the rust and restoring and installing the engines in 2011.

The PLAN intended to operate the vessel as a pure carrier rather than as a cruiser-carrier hybrid so the shipbuilders didn’t bother with the enormous antiship missile systems. They instead confined its armament to a trio of short-range HQ-10 air-defense missile launchers and a few close-defense guns. The vessel’s primary weapon of course would be its complement of twenty-four J-15 Flying Shark fighters. The Flying Sharks are domestic copies of the Russian Su-33 fighter a prototype of which was also acquired from Ukraine in 2001. The Liaoning also flies six Z-12F antisubmarine helicopters four airborne early-warning variants and two Z-9 rescue choppers.

The Liaoning was commissioned on September 25 2012 and the first J-15 landed on it a month later. A home-built carrier based upon the Liaoning will soon put to sea this year; those blueprints must have proved useful.

The Liaoning is hardly equal to a U.S. supercarrier—in addition to its smaller air wing and lack of a nuclear power plant its steam turbines are prone to breaking down and the ski-jump deck limits the fuel and weapons load its fighters can carry. However it afforded China a leap forward in its naval construction program—which now includes five more carriers in the coming decade of increasing planned capability. According to Xu Zengping a naval officer told him that the Varyag saved China fifteen years of research and development.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjEvMTIvMjQvYnVzaW5lc3Mvb21pY3Jvbi1jaHJpc3RtYXMtdHJhdmVsLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,As Omicron Overshadows Christmas Thousands of Flights Are Canceled (Published 2021),"Thousands of frustrated travelers hoping to fly to Christmas celebrations faced a wave of last-minute cancellations as a spike in coronavirus cases sidelined airline workers who had contracted the virus or had been exposed to the fast-spreading Omicron variant.

About 4000 flights around the world scheduled for Christmas Eve or Christmas Day had been scrapped according to FlightAware an aviation data provider — more than 1000 of them in the United States disrupting a holiday season that travelers had hoped would represent a return to relative normalcy as the pandemic enters its third winter.

The cancellations forced stranded passengers in crowded airports from Atlanta to Minneapolis to Washington D.C. to embark on frantic planes-trains-and-automobiles efforts to get where they were going. In many cases that proved impossible.

2021 had seen many milestones in the country’s energy industry including the transformation of Qatar Petroleum into QatarEnergy which will continue to deliver cleaner energy that the world needs and play its role in finding better solutions in the ongoing energy transition.

During the new logo and brand identity launch in Doha in October HE the Minister of State for Energy Affairs Saad bin Sherida al-Kaabi had said: “Becoming QatarEnergy reflects our understanding of the global changes and our response to the need to protect our planet and its environment. Not only will our LNG projects bring additional cleaner energy to customers across the globe but we will continue our heightened commitment to our central role in the global energy transition.”

Indeed Qatar’s flagship energy company has had a historic evolution that saw Qatar Petroleum Company (QPC) getting transformed into Qatar General Petroleum Corporation (QGPC) then becoming Qatar Petroleum (QP) some 20 years ago and QatarEnergy (QE) in October this year.

Undoubtedly natural gas is Qatar’s core business and the country is conducting that in the most professional and responsible way.

Natural gas is also part of the solution in the ongoing energy transition and that it will be a requirement for sustaining the development of the world for at least a few decades.

Therefore QatarEnergy is moving full steam ahead to develop the North field by building state-of-the-art LNG trains that would take the country’s leadership position further with a production capacity of 126mn tonnes per year by 2027.

The transformation also signals a new strategy that focuses on energy efficiency and environmentally-friendly technology such as capturing and storing carbon dioxide.

QatarEnergy is utilising “sophisticated carbon sequestration methods” to capture and sequester 9mn tonnes of carbon dioxide a year by the end of the decade HE al-Kaabi said at the event.

“We are making sure that we protect our environment by keeping our carbon footprint at a minimum. This is why we are utilising sophisticated carbon sequestration methods” al-Kaabi noted.

To support its LNG expansion and as part of its historic shipbuilding programme to meet its future LNG carrier requirements QatarEnergy last month placed the first batch of LNG shipbuilding orders with Korean shipyards consisting of four vessels from Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering (DSME) and two vessels from Samsung Heavy Industries (SHI).

QatarEnergy’s LNG carrier fleet programme is the largest of its kind in the LNG industry and is designed to meet the shipping requirements of QatarEnergy’s LNG expansion projects as well as replacing part of Qatar's existing LNG fleet.

The year also saw QatarEnergy announcing long-term LNG supply agreement with many global firms including China’s S&T International Guangdong Energy Group and CNOOC and South Korea's Kogas Taiwan's CPC Pakistan State Oil Company and Vitol for its Bangladeshi customers.

The year also saw a significant expansion of QatarEnergy business in many countries around the globe.

QatarEnergy in a consortium with TotalEnergies and Petronas was recently awarded the Sépia Surplus Production Sharing Contract (PSC) under the Second Transfer of Rights Surplus Bidding Round by Brazil’s National Agency of Petroleum Natural Gas and Biofuels (ANP).

Under the terms of the PSC and associated agreements QatarEnergy will hold a 21% interest in the PSC alongside operator Petrobras (30%) TotalEnergies (28%) and Petronas (21%).

This month QatarEnergy entered into agreements with Shell to acquire working interests in two offshore exploration blocks in the Egyptian side of the Red Sea.

Under the terms of the agreements which are subject to customary approvals by the government of Egypt QatarEnergy will hold a 17% working interest in Red Sea Blocks 3 and 4.

In April Qatar had entered into an agreement with Shell to become a partner in two exploration blocks offshore the Republic of Namibia.

Under the terms of the agreement which is subject to customary approvals QatarEnergy will hold a 45% participating interest in the PEL 39 exploration licence pertaining to Block 2913A and Block 2914B while Shell (the operator) will hold a 45% interest and the National Petroleum Corporation of Namibia (NAMCOR) will hold the remaining 10% interest.

Earlier this year QatarEnergy had announced that it aims to create low carbon energy by growing renewable energy capacity ie solar projects by 2-4 gigawatts (GW) by 2030.

In its last Sustainability Report QatarEnergy highlighted its commitment to climate mitigation.

The company said it is the main engine for growth and prosperity in Qatar taking an active role in safeguarding its unique environment and contributing to preserving the planet thereby working alongside all players in the energy sector both in Qatar and internationally to fast track decarbonisation of the sector to meet Paris Agreement goals.

Since the launch of its environmental initiatives nearly a decade ago QatarEnergy has achieved real momentum across its facilities and those of its affiliates to reduce their carbon footprint."

Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...

RESERVE – In 2019 DSC Dredge LLC a world leading manufacturer of cutter suction dredges located in St. John the Baptist Parish signed a memorandum of understanding with Deep Diggers Ltd Bangladesh with a project focus of providing an engineering design and component package.

Deep Diggers Ltd imported all the dredge components from DSC including the Caterpillar diesel engine dredge pump gearbox cutter assembly winches hydraulic system and lever room and controls. All steel fabrication including the hull side pontoons ladder and spuds were built by Deep Diggers at their facility in Chattogram Bangladesh. Deep Diggers installed all the DSC supplied components including the complete hydraulic and electrical systems. After a year building and countless manpower hours the two companies are proud to announce the successful launch of two 18” Shark Class dredges. DSC provided Product Support for 30 days onsite to help commission the two new dredges and provide crew training in operations and maintenance.

A video of the launch accompanying this announcement is available by clicking here.

Director of International Dredge Sales at DSC Dredge Charles Sinunu commented “Deep Diggers Chairman Gauhar Siraj Jamil and his directors had the wisdom and confidence that they could produce quality dredges with the support from DSC. I expected some challenges with the first build but everything went very smoothly. We have proved the concept to ourselves and to the local market. We look forward to a very long relationship with Deep Diggers.”

The 18” Shark Model SH-10300-200-56D has the advantage to dig to 17m (56 ft) below the surface deeper than most of the dredges in Bangladesh. The dredges built in Bangladesh will use the same advanced components as DSC dredges built in the USA including variable displacement-load sense and variable displacement-closed loop systems. They are powered by a single Caterpillar C32 diesel engine rated 1125 hp and features a 200 hp cutter drive.

With the advanced DSC hydraulic system and fuel-efficient Caterpillar engine this dredge will have a very low cost of operation which means more profits for the dredge contractors in Bangladesh. This is a game changer for their industry.

One of the Deep Diggers Directors Mr. Omar Sharif (Tuhin) stated “We were pleased to partner with the premier dredge manufacturer from the USA DSC Dredge. I have known Charlie Sinunu for more than 15 years and we always hoped that we could find a project together. Now as one of the Directors of Deep Diggers and the local representative of DSC we can build as well as service all DSC dredges in the country. We are factory trained and pride ourselves on providing 24/7/365 service to all DSC clients in Bangladesh. We look forward to building many more dredges in the future with DSC.”

DSC Dredge President and CEO Bob Wetta commented “I am extremely proud of the finished product with all of the setbacks of COVID in 2020 the Deep Diggers manufacturing team stayed diligent in bringing this dredge to life. We look forward to the future and what it holds for our collaboration.”

DSC is a global leader in the dredge manufacturing industry engineering superior customized dredging solutions to meet specific application needs while continuing to exceed customer expectations.

How to Create a Dividend Portfolio for Daily Cash

We can do this because most dividend stocks pay out on extremely consistent schedules. Investors love the certainty and dividend-paying companies try paying out in the same week even the same day every three months. That means with a little bit of strategy we can fill our portfolio with income stocks that will time our payments for every day of the week.

Now how this is going to work is through these three videos I’ll highlight those dividend income stocks that will be paying out in the next month. For example today we’ll highlight 17 dividend stocks that will pay out in December March June and September. I’ll show you exactly how I found these stocks later in the video but here you can see that I analyzed almost 400 dividend stocks to find the perfect income portfolio for each and every month.

The goal here is going to be about 60 stocks that will generate a dividend income on every weekday of each month. And the best part not only is this going to be a well-diversified portfolio producing constant dividends I’ve picked the best dividend stocks with a yield over 4%…that’s twice the average dividend yield on the market.

Dividend Stocks for Constant Cash Flow

Let’s jump right into that list then I’ll show you how I put together the portfolio of daily dividend stocks!

We’re getting started with a fan favorite Iron Mountain ticker IRM and one of the best dividend yields on the list at nine percent.

IRM is a records management provider with more than 225000 clients trusting it to store hard copy documents as well as digital transformations and storage. But the real value here comes in the form of the company’s real estate where all this is stored more than 90 million square feet across almost 1500 properties.

The company is set up as a real estate investment trust which means it gets a special tax break if it distributes at least 90% of profits to investors. That means you get that sky-high 9% yield with the stock going ex-dividend about mid-month in December March June and September.

IRM is a great start to our dividend portfolio and has grown its payout by 27% over the last five years.

Now remember the dates you’re going to see here on these dividend stocks are the ex-dividend date. How it works is a company’s Board of Directors declares the next dividend and the ex-dividend date. That ex-dividend date is the first day the shares trade WITHOUT the dividend so if you want that payout you want to make sure you pick up the shares at least one day before this.

The idea here isn’t to jump in or out of these dividend stocks so this isn’t going to matter as much to you long-term investors. Just put the stock in your portfolio and you’ll get that dividend every time it comes around.

Next on the list of daily dividend stocks powerhouse Altria Group ticker MO and its 8.8% dividend.

Now if you’re set against investing in some of these vice stocks then you can always substitute out another dividend payer that goes ex-dividend around the same time but for yield and dividend certainty it’s hard to beat Altria.

Besides owning the dominant tobacco brand in the U.S. and a dividend that has grown by 53% over the last five years Altria has some key investments that will help it grow. The company holds a 10% stake in the world’s largest brewer Anheuser-Busch and a 45% stake in cannabis giant Cronos Group. So you’ve got very stable cash flow from the tobacco and alcohol segments and that moonshot potential in cannabis.

Altria is one of the later stocks to go ex-dividend on our list late in December March June and September. That means you’ll usually get your dividend payment about two weeks later.

Our first stock in the financials $12 billion KeyCorp ticker KEY and its 5.8% dividend yield.

KeyCorp is a small regional bank with branches in 16 states but concentrated mostly in Ohio and New York. And those of you in the Nation now financials are one of my favorite sectors for the next couple of years. The sector has been slammed by low rates and is trading at a deep discount.

Case in point shares of KeyCorp trade for just 0.81-times book value which is a 38% discount to the 1.3 multiple it traded at last year. So potentially a lot of value to be unlocked if interest rates start heading higher and the economy keeps growing.

Beyond valuation and the high dividend yield KeyCorp has lately made some strong acquisitions in technology names like HelloWallet and Laurel Road which could give it surprise growth above other regional banks.

The dividend payment has boomed 146% over the past five years and usually goes ex-dividend during the first days of the month in December March June and August.

Another value play here $3.5 billion oil play Devon Energy ticker DVN and its 5% yield.

Next to financials energy is my other big call for the next few years and in fact I’ve added Devon Energy into our 2021 Bow Tie Nation portfolio on Stockcard.

If you’re looking for one sector where everyone is fearful and it may be time to be greedy it’s in the energy space. The price of oil crashed this year on loss of demand and the entire sector has fallen 49% year-to-date.

Will Oil Stocks Recover in 2021?

Being ahead of this means finding those cash-rich best of breed oil companies with the survivability to recover when the market does and Devon is one of the best in the space. The company has nearly $1.5 billion in balance sheet cash and will have no problem keeping up with its debt.

Despite dropping into negative earnings last quarter the company still beat the market estimate by 30% and is expected to return to profitability by the first quarter.

Shares usually go ex-dividend mid-month in December March June and September and paid out a special dividend August this year. Even the lowest analyst estimate has shares up 42% over the next year for a potentially huge upside along with the dividend.

Omnicom ticker OMC is the world’s second-largest ad holding company spanning public relations traditional and digital advertising.

Ad spending is the first to go when company budgets get tight so it’s no surprise that Omnicom has sold off this year but it’s still a solid company. The company has over $3.3 billion in balance sheet cash so no near-term financial problems and is trading at a discount of 38% from its peak.

Management has a history of beating expectations and is positioned to take advantage of the growth in digital ads. The dividend payment has grown a respectable 30% over the past five years and shares go ex-dividend early- to mid-month.

Adding some diversification here with Archer-Daniels Midland ticker ADM and its 2.9% dividend.

Agricultural producers have just started rebounding this year after years of trade war pain and I think there’s further to go for processors like ADM. The company has one of the largest networks for crop storage and transportation which should do well as the trade picture improves.

Even under the weaker environment the dividend here grew by 28% over the last five years and I expect that to pick up. Shares go ex-dividend mid- to late-month in November February May and August.

Another energy name here with Schlumberger Limited ticker SLB and its 3.3% dividend yield.

Now this one is probably the riskiest of my energy bets but still a fairly solid company with $3.8 billion in balance sheet cash. As an oil-field services company Schlumberger has seen its revenue plunge this year as explorers pull back and let some of their fields go into maintenance.

The company is one of the best in its industry with an advantage in drilling that’s hard to beat so there’s a very good chance this one survives and produces not only that dividend but a hefty price return as well. The dividend was cut 75% in June to protect cash flow but still pays that 3.3% yield and goes ex-dividend usually towards the beginning of the month.

How to Pick Dividend Stocks for Daily Payments

We’ve got ten more dividend stocks to highlight and stick with me because we’ve got the highest yields coming up.

I want to go through real quickly how I picked these stocks how I put the portfolio together so you can find your own dividend stocks or just adjust the portfolio when you need to.

Now the concept is easy but it took hours to put together the data on this. I took the 366 stocks in the S&P 500 that pay dividends nearly 400 large-cap companies I then went to the stock page for each one. You can find this on any investing platform but I went to Yahoo Finance and then to this Historical Data tab.

From here I changed the time period and then to Show Dividends Only to see the dividend dates for the last five years. I took that and copied it into my spreadsheet for every single stock noting the dividend dates over the last year.

Once I did that I could note when each dividend stock paid out on each day and then could pick the best for our portfolio. For example for today’s video there were 178 stocks going ex-dividend mid-November and into December.

This allowed me not only to create an income portfolio that pays out nearly every weekday of the month but also to select only the strongest companies with the highest dividend yields.

More Dividend Stocks You Can Count On

Prologis ticker PLD is in one of my favorite real estate types right now and pays a 2.25% dividend.

My Bow Tie Warriors out there you know I love real estate. Got my professional start there as a commercial property analyst and have my own rentals but some of the property types are looking UGLY this year!

Eight of the 12 REIT property sectors are posting losses this year with some getting absolutely smashed. Retail down 39% lodging is down 49% and office space is down 30% for 2020. But there are some sectors doing relatively well like industrial self-storage and data centers are booming.

And Prologis is a leader in that industrial space with 900 million square feet of logistics and warehouse property. Strength in the segment is being driven by ecommerce and the need for those distribution centers and it’s a great long-term trend to be in.

The dividend payment has increased by 45% over the last five years and usually goes ex-dividend mid-month December March June and September.

CBOE Global Markets ticker CBOE operates the options exchange in Chicago and pays a 2% dividend yield.

CBOE is one of the smaller exchanges that have yet to be consolidated into the larger companies but still operates the largest U.S. options exchange as well as a futures exchange. With the growth in retail stock trading this year I’m surprised shares haven’t done better and I like this one as a rebound play.

The dividend has nearly doubled growing 83% over the last five years and it’s a great cash-flow stock going ex-dividend late-month in November February May and August.

Another investor favorite on the list here with the 3M Company ticker MMM and its 3.5% dividend yield.

3M is one of the oldest companies on the list around since 1902 and one that has increased its dividend for an amazing 62-consecutive years.

The company operates in four segments; industrial transportation and electronics healthcare and consumer which gives it a breadth you probably won’t find anywhere else and helps protect that cash flow.

As big as it is the dividend growth surprised me here with 43% growth in the payment in the last five years along with a stable price return. Shares go ex-dividend mid-month in November February May and August.

Another in the financial sector this one in insurance with Prudential Financial ticker PRU and its 6.7% dividend.

Prudential is the second-largest life insurer in the U.S. with significant exposure in Japan as well. The entire industry has been hit on those low interest rates making it harder for insurers to earn a return on their cash reserves but management has released a plan to cut $500 million in costs to boost the bottom line.

Shares trade for a 30% discount on a price-to-book value trading for just 0.4-times the book value of assets and this one has grown the dividend by a solid 57% over the last five years.

Hey Nation while I’ve got you here can I ask a favor? If you’re on Instagram head on over after this video and join the Let’s Talk Money community. I’m sharing motivational quotes investing advice and a personal side I don’t get to show here on the channel so I hope I see you there.

Six more dividend stocks to round out the list and next is Waste Management ticker WM and its 1.9% dividend yield.

Now a 2% yield might not sound so great but this stock has produced an annualized 12.2% return on top of that yield over the last decade. It’s the largest solid waste services company in the U.S. with over 250 land fills and let’s face it probably one of the most stable business models there is.

The share price isn’t the only thing growing with the dividend up 42% over the last five years and one where you can count on future growth.

I highlighted Huntington Bancshares ticker HBAN recently as a favorite in the financials and its 6.3% dividend yield.

Huntington is another small regional bank with branches across eight states in the Midwest. The bank has doubled the amount in its loan loss provision account to over $1.7 billion and has still been able to consistently beat earnings expectations. It’s trading at a 35% discount to last year’s price-to-book multiple and if loan defaults aren’t as bad as feared could see a major earnings surprise.

Even with the slowdown over the past year the dividend has grown 114% over the last five years for a great yield on top of that price potential.

A little more of a safety pick here with PPL Corporation ticker PPL and its 6% dividend.

PPL is a regulated utility provider in Pennsylvania and Kentucky that recently announced plans to sell off its UK operations. That will take a lot of the uncertainty out of the business model and allow the company to focus on its U.S. operations. The move gives it more dividend stability and should also improve investor sentiment in the shares.

And that dividend uncertainty has played out with just a 10% dividend growth over the past five years the lowest in our group but I think you see it start rising from here.

Another agriculture play here with FMC Corporation ticker FMC and its 1.6% dividend yield.

Now another one with a relatively low dividend but an amazing total return producing a 12.6% annual price return over the last decade on top of that yield.

FMC is a pure-play crop chemical company and should benefit from that long-term trend to food demand and the need for higher crop yields. Shares are fairly valued here but it’s hard to argue with a 166% growth in the dividend over five years and that kind of long-term price return.

A little riskier bet in the real estate space is Ventas ticker VTR a healthcare REIT and its 4.3% dividend.

Ventas owns a portfolio of 1200 properties across medical office hospital and healthcare but concentrated in the senior living and skilled nursing niche. Most healthcare properties have been hit this year but most especially the senior care market but it looks like even this is turning more positive.

Occupancy hasn’t declined significantly and with a vaccine approval we should get better investor sentiment in names like Ventas. Shares are down 41% from last year’s peak and the company did cut the dividend this year to protect cash flow but I think it can be a strong long-term investment.

Valero Energy ticker VLO offers our highest yield of the group with a dividend just under 10%.

One of the largest refinery operations in the U.S. with 14 facilities in North America and the U.K. the company is uniquely positioned to refine lower-quality crude and has been able to produce higher profit margins.

The refineries have been hit just like all energy companies but quality names like Valero will survive. The company also owns over 3100 miles of pipeline and other midstream assets that give it a transportation advantage.

Valero is one of the very few in the energy space to maintain its dividend this year and has nearly doubled it over the past five years.

November Dividends List

The 17 stocks in this months portfolio produce a dividend yield of 4.9% just slightly above the entire 56-stock portfolio with a 4.2% yield. That’s 56 dividend-paying companies in every sector with a yield more than double the overall market that is going to put cash in your pocket every single day!

Investing in Dividends is Safe and Steady

What is the one thing everybody wants?

Money.

Everybody wants some more money but not everyone is willing to work hard for it. What if you are someone who does not want to have to work for your money? Well you can just leave that up to the stock market! Stocks are a way of owning part of a company and owning something means having rights to some of what that business makes. When companies make money they have to decide what to do with it put it in the bank (savings) invest in new equipment (capital expenditures) or give it back to shareholders (dividends).

However most companies choose option number 3 giving dividends back! There are two types of dividends: cash dividends and stock dividends. Cash dividends are just that money! You will get a check in your mailbox or direct deposited into your account. The amount changes every quarter since it depends on how much the company made.

Dividends are one of the most important things when it comes to buying stocks. There are many different types of investors you can be but dividends should definitely make up a big part of your strategy. If you do not actually get money every time the company makes money then what good does it do? Well dividends are taxed less than regular income so if you want to keep more of your own money they allow for this! Not only this but it is very safe. When they give you that money it is real money in your bank account (or brokerage statement). If something bad happens to the stock market then there is no chance they will go bankrupt and stop paying out dividends.

There are many different types of dividends you can get: quarterly dividend special dividend variable dividend high yield dividend  etc. They have different rules for how often you get them or how much they are. A good company will usually payout a very high percentage of their earnings each year as cash dividends – usually 4-5%. You are probably thinking this sounds too good to be true and you would be right. There are a few things to keep in mind when investing in dividend paying stocks.

Dividends are one of the most important things when it comes to picking stocks they can make a huge difference over time! They allow companies to pay back investors for all their hard work while still having some left over for themselves. Plus they offer lower risk than normal investments because they do not fluctuate as much as the stock price does. However beware that dividends may decrease or stop completely if you invest in a company during a bad period. It is also very important for investors looking for these high yields to have a lot of research on their potential investments.

Ltd in its its ‘India Future of Office Survey 2021’- conducted between September and November this year states that 80 per cent of Indian occupiers prioritize physical offices while expressing a desire to bring employees back into offices. 88 per cent of participants agreed that business conditions in India need to improve. A total of 100 occupiers with more than 100000 employees in India were approached by the consulting firm. The survey model included firms from key sectors including technology BFSI engineering & manufacturing infrastructure real estate & logistics research consulting & analytics and pharmaceuticals/healthcare. Anshuman Magazine Chairman & CEO - India South-East Asia Middle East & Africa CBRE said “In CBRE’s view despite increased adoption of hybrid working during the pandemic a wider adoption in the long-run seems unlikely. Even with the adoption of hybrid work most companies expect employees to work in the office most of the time. This new shift in working patterns should be considered amidst occupiers’ intent to expand portfolios in India over the next two years. We thus believe the adoption of hybrid working practices would have only a limited downside impact on future office demand in the medium to long term particularly as space planning is undertaken based on long-term peak occupancy rates.” According to the survey findings occupants developers and investors will adopt new behaviours to accommodate workplace flexibility and safety. In general senior business leaders want their employees to come back to work and 80 per cent prefer physical offices but they are also willing to allow greater flexibility and choice. In India 58 per cent of respondents plan to implement policies allowing hybrid work cultures. After the second wave scenarios in India occupiers are working to boost return-to-work plans by ensuring the safety and well-being of employees. The survey also reveals that three tech enhancements (admin facilities management and amenities as well as space tracking) are necessary to facilitate the return to work process. Ram Chandnani Managing Director Advisory & Transactions Services CBRE India said “The current pandemic is accelerating changes in performance expectations and role of the workplace. Successful and targeted strategies can envision a practically implementable ‘Future of Work Concept’ effectively leveraging potential changes in work styles and corresponding opportunities to rebalance the workplace. The majority of the respondents were clear on the importance of the physical office across India APAC and larger global markets. While the relevance of physical space is here to stay the focus of business must be on the evolving purpose of office spaces.” “The nature of the workplace has completely evolved over the past two years. The adoption of hybrid work is likely to require companies to enhance their workplace strategies to deliver seamless and engaging experiences. The successful adoption of hybrid work within a company would require defining where work can be accomplished what work requires in-person collaboration to accomplish and who benefits most from spending time in the office.” added Ram Chandnani. The survey concluded that despite hybrid work during the pandemic real estate strategies in the future would not favour fully remote or in-office work. Based on the survey's responses employees expect strategies to support choices end-user experiences and actions that facilitate the integration of life and work. Another important CRE area highlighted by the survey is the growing importance of Environmental Social and Governance (ESG). CBRE's 2021 Global Investor Intentions Survey Report found that nearly 60 per cent of respondents have already adopted environmental social and governance criteria as part of their investment strategies.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover he revealed the exact reason for wearing these glasses on a golf course during an event. So let us see why exactly does Phil Mickelson wears sunglasses?

Why did Phil Mickelson started wearing sunglasses?

Phil Mickelson wore sunglasses for the first time at the Charles Schwab Challenge which was the first event after the pandemic. After a few days Mickelson was in the commentary box where they asked him the reason for wearing sunglasses. “Back during Covid break I did this Carac cream which is like skin cancer chemotherapy treatment on your face for like two weeks” said Phil.

“You skin blotches up and you kill these cancer cells that you can’t see. And when I went outside I had to wear some protection. So I wore these glasses to kind of protect the area around my eyes.” However it wasn’t clear if he was using the cream as a precaution or to combat an existing condition.

Moreover Phil Mickelson said they didn’t move around while swinging and it helped him to keep his eyes relaxed as well. Hence the 2021 PGA Championship winner decided to wear glasses every time while playing on a golf course.

The pop star is partnering with the fast food giant on “the Mariah menu” 12 days of deals offered through the McDonald’s app from Dec. 13-24 beginning with a Big Mac on Dec. 13 and ending with chocolate chip cookies on Dec. 24.

Pop star promotions were one of the big restaurant trends of 2021.

Here is a look at some things that shaped the dining industry throughout the year.

Music deals

McDonald’s embraced hip-hop and TikTok in a ground-breaking way through its “Famous Orders” campaign.

It began with a partnership with Travis Scott in September 2020 that included a Travis Scott meal — Quarter Pounder with Cheese fries barbecue sauce and a Sprite — and tie-in merchandise.

McDonald’s followed up with with Famous Orders for J Balvin and ventured into the K-Pop world with the band BTS. These celebrity meals repackaged foods that were already on McDonald’s menu sometimes adding special sauce packets as a novelty. The Saweetie Meal offered in July include “Saweetie ‘N Sour” sauce for dipping Chicken McNuggets.

McDonald’s wasn’t alone

Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen banded with rapper Megan Thee Stallion on Megan Thee Stallion Hottie Sauce for its chicken sandwiches and nuggets in October.

Taco Bell appointed Little Nas X as chief impact officer an honorary title the chain said “would allow him to collaborate on the brand experience from the inside out.”

And Snoop Dogg continued an association with Raising Cane’s Chicken Fingers that included working a drive-thru window at a Dallas restaurant.

Chicken sandwiches

Fried chicken sandwiches have become a must-have on quick service menus. The so-called chicken sandwich wars started in August 2019 when Popeyes Louisiana Chicken added a sandwich to its menu going up against Chick-fil-A and in 2021 nobody seemed willing to call a truce.

“Now it’s just required that everyone have a chicken sandwich” said marketing expert Deb Gabor author of “Irrational Loyalty” a book about how companies bond with consumers.

Carl’s Jr. went big on crispy chicken added sandwiches to its permanent menu and its breakfast menu and then following up with limited time offers. Burger King McDonald’s and Farmer Boys made similar moves.

Chains that were already known for chicken such as KFC and Wendy’s added new chicken sandwiches to their menus.

Jollibee an Asian restaurant chain that is rapidly growing in the United States entered the fray in September with its Jollibee Chickenwich and in December introduced Spicy Chickenjoy a hotter version of its signature fried chicken.

Virtual brands

With restaurants closed or unable to use all of their space due to lockdown the novel coronavirus created a growth climate for online brands that are ordered through delivery services. They bring food to the public instead of requiring people to come to them.

Such businesses are called virtual kitchens. Other frequently used terms include ghost kitchens and cloud kitchens. They often have short menus focused on items that travel well such as chicken wings.

The appeal to entrepreneurs is low startup costs and fewer real estate headaches.

Robert Earl co-founder of Virtual Dining Concepts was selected by Quick Service Restaurants magazine as one of the top digital disruptors of 2021. Last last year he hit pay dirt launching Mr. Beast Burger a partnership with influencer Jimmy Donaldson who has 62 million YouTube subscribers.

Earl also partnered with celebrity chef Guy Fieri and other stars such as Mariah Carey whose McDonald’s collaboration includes free cookies perhaps putting her in competition with her own online cookie business.

One of his newer concepts is Buddy V’s Cake Slice a partnership with “Cake Boss” star Buddy Valastro that can be ordered in Southern California cities from Encino to Yucaipa according to its website.

Established restaurant chains are also dabbling in virtual concepts. They include Dickey’s Barbecue Pit which in June launched a virtual brand called Big Deal Burgers. Cracker Barrel which has only two locations in the Inland Empire expanded its footprint into Hollywood through a virtual operation called Cracker Barrel Kitchen.

‘Real’ food

Consumers’ growing awareness of what they’re putting in their bodies has caused several restaurant chains to describe their foods as minimally processed or “real.”

Islands Restaurant a casual chain launched a “clean food” campaign last summer promoting its made-to-order french fries.

In August Shake Shack boasted about Damon Roy the New Orleans beekeeper who generated much of the raw honey used in the glaze for the chain’s Hot Honey Chicken sandwich.

Chipotle Mexican Grill which boasts about the limited number of ingredients in its foods takes it a step further by campaigning for sustainability. In November it announced a plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 50 percent by 2030 in its supply chain restaurant operations and packaging.

Chipotle also carries out its real food theme in its online merchandise. This month it introduced an “all natural” bar of cilantro soap.

Staff shortages

Fallout from the novel coronavirus pandemic continues months after California reopened dining rooms.

Restaurants are striving to make customers’ experiences as normal as possible but staffing shortages remain a challenge.

Some have responded by shortening their menus shortening their hours or opening on fewer days.

But the challenge is more than just the number of employees according to Mike Whatley vice president for State Affairs and Grassroots Advocacy for the National Restaurant Association.

It’s the loss of experience and even of a friendly face that diners remember.

“We’ve lost a lot of talent both front of house and back of house” he said in a phone interview.

“There are a lot of people who go to a restaurant because of their favorite food server or favorite bartender. If that person has left the industry or left that restaurant that affects customer experience.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBhY2thZ2luZy1nYXRld2F5LmNvbS91bmNhdGVnb3JpemVkL3NtdXJmaXQta2FwcGEtY29tbWlzc2lvbnMtcG02LW1hY2hpbmUtcGFwZXItbWlsbC1zaXRlLW1leGljby_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Smurfit Kappa commissions PM6 machine at paper mill site in Mexico -,"Installed at the Los Reyes Paper Mill the PM6 produces recycled containerboard.

“Mexico is a market with strong growth potential which is key to our operations in the region. We continue to invest in this country to boost our competitiveness and offer our customers the very best in sustainable packaging.”

The company recently invested in a modernisation project for converting plants.

We speak to Ashaita Mahajan one of the co-founders to understand their work with people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDDs).

It has been seven odd years since Mumbai-based Aarti Nagarkar (35) moved back to India from the States but ask her about her favourite things in life and she says without hesitation �Chipotle Mexican Grill and relaxing while watching The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon!�

While Aarti�s workplace is barely a five-minute walk from her residence in Juhu she takes a secluded route on the insides of the upmarket neighbourhood to avoid its regular commotion. As a person with autism she abides by three golden rules � no to fireworks barking dogs and loud crowds.

She is among the 18 full-time employees at Caf� Arpan a one-of-its-kind establishment where all servers kitchen and counter assistants have some kind of intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDDs). The Caf� was set up in 2018 by the Yash Charitable Trust (YCT) a city-based NGO that has been providing skill development and livelihood opportunities to adults with IDDs since 2014.

It was heavily inspired by one Puzzle Caf� in Manila Philippines opened by a couple to offer a safe working environment for their autistic son says Ashaita Mahajan Aarti�s cousin and co-founder of Caf� Arpan.

�Aarti and I were born six days apart and share an extremely special bond. Soon after she moved back to Mumbai her mother Sushama founded the YCT on the pillars of acceptance empowerment and inclusion. I quit my job in the culture sector to come on board as an active trustee in 2017. A year later my aunt and I opened the Caf� to offer a live demonstration of what is possible if PwIDDs are provided with the opportunity to lead a dignified life� Ashaita tells The Better India.

It is estimated that 3 per cent of India�s population or 31 million individuals live with IDDs as per a ResearchGate report. Covering a wide spectrum of conditions such as autism Asperger’s syndrome down syndrome and cerebral palsy IDDs often present at birth and distinctively impact an individual�s physical intellectual emotional and/or social skills.

�There are so many organisations that exclusively work towards providing interventional support to children with disabilities. But the reality is they all grow up to be adults who can�t be expected to continue functioning within [the safety of] special schools. Yes there are some people on the autism spectrum who are high-functioning and capable of going to college eventually leading fairly �normal� lives. But others like Aarti wouldn�t be able to get a job in the open market easily� she notes. �At the same time they have so many strengths and all they need is a boost of confidence and a platform that allows them to showcase their skills.�

From a �Dabba� Service to a City Hub

Located across the SNDT Women’s University�s Juhu campus in Santacruz West Caf� Arpan plays host to dozens of customers every day who wander in for its inhouse focaccia bread sandwiches methi puri chaat nachni wraps hummus and falafel among other small bites and hot & cold beverages.

�We also offer plenty of gluten-free vegan and Jain options. The Caf� has a lovely aroma of coffee at all times thanks to our star beverage-maker Anand who measures all ingredients to the �t�. We�ve been told several times that his cold coffee is the best our customers have had in the city� says Ashaita.

�Our head chef Aaron who is autistic has the memory of an elephant. He remembers all our recipes by heart but we mostly approach him to remind us of everyone�s birthdays� she adds with a laugh.

Customers at Caf� Arpan are usually greeted and seated by Aarti who works as a server. Occasionally however she also sings to customers she hits it off with. �I take classes in opera western and Hindustani classical music and also play the piano. Someday I�m going to be a superstar singer� she grins.

Meanwhile a bulk of the orders and the Caf�s regular earnings are handled by Nikhil Sharma (40) one of the two counter assistants at Caf� Arpan who has Asperger’s syndrome. �Sometimes I get angry and anxious when I think of the past but I calm down when I remember [the coping mechanisms taught to me by] my father. It makes me happy to be a working man. I pay close attention to how the manager works and eventually I could also become one� he says.

Even as Caf� Arpan now enjoys an excellent reputation in the neighbourhood its humble beginnings are to be traced to a dabba (tiffin) service launched by YCT in 2015 with a team of only four members including Aarti.

�We had decided to convert a family-owned garage in Juhu to a small kitchen and collaborated with a home chef starting with catering to her existing customers. Before we knew it we had gone viral on WhatsApp. By 2017 we had about 15 members and the kitchen was starting to become crowded. That�s when we first started conceptualising Caf� Arpan� says Ashaita adding that the tiffin service was later rebranded to Arpan Food Services.

�Another key element that was missing was that team members couldn�t interact with our customers for too long. We knew that they looked forward to making the deliveries because they used to fight about it. Now at Caf� Arpan they�ve emerged as social butterflies � so many of our customers specifically enquire about particular members� shifts just so they can come in to meet them� she adds.

Even as the YCT primarily relied on the family�s personal network for monetary support the trustees launched a fundraising campaign on ImpactGuru to raise additional money for setting up Caf� Arpan. Within the first two weeks they had raised Rs 5 lakh.

�The response was overwhelmingly positive. By the end of five months we had managed to raise Rs 12 lakh and we were extremely cautious on how to spend the money. We faced some discrimination in terms of procuring the location as some landlords were not willing to rent a space to an NGO working with differently-abled adults. As luck would have it we found the perfect space next to our garage which could operate as a back-end kitchen until the Caf�s construction was completed� she says.

While Ashaita�s sister-in-law undertook the designing of the Caf�s interiors a friend took care of its branding Meanwhile a fellow YCT trustee�s son-in-law designed the initial menu. On 2 August 2018 the establishment was inaugurated by noted filmmaker Kiran Rao � all thanks to Aarti.

�Back in April (2018) Aarti was invited to be a panellist at an independent documentary festival in Colaba and she happened to sit next to Kiran Rao who was a moderator at the event. Charmed by her words Kiran later invited us to her dressing room and Aarti spontaneously invited her to the inauguration. We kept in touch and months later she showed up� recalls Ashaita.

With the YCT being fortunate enough to receive ample media attention and support from individuals Ashaita says that several families gradually started approaching them to seek employment opportunities for their adult sons and daughters with IDDs.

�So in 2019 we decided to launch a skill development centre. Presently we have about four trainers leading enrichment therapies by way of music dance art and craft yoga and other physical fitness activities. Of the 32 PwIDDs associated with us 18 are salaried employees who work rotating shifts to split their time between the Arpan Food Services and the Caf�. We�re also training two women to become trainers so that it might help in possible expansions in the future� she adds.

The only requisites they look for she says is that candidates must have a disability certificate and be able to independently use the washroom. At the skill centre they are given lessons on both interpersonal communication and industry practices.

�We recently had two team members from the skill centre graduate to working for the Arpan Food Services. Given the right guidance and support PwIDDs can function perfectly fine. We don�t want their families and society to see them as a burden or have them waste away a shot at a meaningful life� she says.

The Way Ahead

Owing to growing disability inclusion at Indian workplaces in recent times Caf� Arpan has also been approached by other food-based organisations to hire PwIDDs.

�We�ve been very lucky to place a team member at a restaurant who has been included in their workplace beautifully; his team members absolutely adore him. On the other hand another young man was not only denied adequate opportunities but was exposed to pornographic material. But you wouldn�t be able to tell this if you met him now; he has so much potential and does wonderful work for the community. It�s heartbreaking to come across these negative instances but all the more important to highlight the positive ones� she notes.

Last year Ashaita says that Caf� Arpan got a glimpse of what they hope is in store for them in the future. The establishment was approached by the Vikhroli office of Accenture in January 2020 to run an in-house Caf� for over 3000 of their employees.

�It was one of the best experiences we�ve had in the history of YCT. Not only was a corporation bringing us on board on an equal footing they were also providing us free space bearing transportation costs and a steady stream of customers. We had the opportunity to work for them for about three months until the COVID-19 outbreak hit India. They haven�t resumed physical hours at full capacity yet but we�ve been told we�ll get a chance to resume our services once they do� she says.

�People keep asking me when we�re opening more outlets of Caf� Arpan. I tell them I�d be happy to open a pop-up in every corner of the country so long as they sponsor us� she laughs.

Liverpool's courts or some of the busiest in the county and see thousands of cases move through them every year.

These cases can vary from less serious offences to those which have devastating effects on families and communities.

Every case heard at the city's crown magistrates and youth courts has its own unique details which affect its outcome.

As a result there can be huge variations in the sentences people convicted of crimes receive whether due to their own circumstances or legal guidelines for the crimes they've committed.

The people here went through the courts for vastly different reasons but the one thing they all have in common is that they walked free in 2021.

Craig Stringer

A coked up son battered his 84-year-old mum after going into the ""frail"" woman's bedroom.

Craig Stringer was high on cocaine when he went home in the early hours and attacked his elderly mother while she was sleeping in her bed.

His victim lost a tooth and suffered wounds to her back and to her shin as well as bruises to her arms.

Stringer 51 who had taken three grams of cocaine in the lead up to the attack admitted grievous bodily harm of the elderly woman.

Stringer was handed a two year sentence suspended for two years and must complete 15 Rehabilitation Activity Requirements and 200 hours of unpaid work.

A 12 month restraining order preventing him from attending his mother's address was also imposed.

Jack Williams





A drunken dad attacked his own disabled father after the two had struggled with a knife.

Jack Williams beat his 63-year-old dad with a walking stick after taking the knife into his room on December 9 last year.

He had been a carer for Robert Topham who is bed bound and who has suffered four strokes and one heart attack.

Liverpool Magistrates' Court heard how the 21-year-old's dad had ""never been so scared"" and wanted to move home so his son couldn't find him.

He was spared jail after a chair magistrate said Williams was ""particularly vulnerable by the nature of his physical and mental health"".

Williams was handed an 18 week sentence suspended for 12 months and must complete 25 Rehabilitation Activity Requirement days.

He was also ordered to complete 180 hours of unpaid work and must pay £100 in compensation to the police officer costs of £85 and a victim surcharge of £128.

Magistrates also imposed a two year restraining order preventing Williams from contacting Mr Topham.

Gayle Smylie

(Image: Liverpool Echo)

A mum-of-three held a shard from a broken mug to a love rivals' throat after invading her home.

Gayle Smylie repeatedly hit Kelly Featherstone after her and Anthony Moss who is said to have previously 'two-timed' the pair stormed her home on October 20 2018.

The 29-year-old has two children and Ms Featherstone has one child to Anthony Moss a court heard.

Smyle and Moss drove up to the woman's home in a car with blacked out windows after she had allegedly made controversial remarks about Smylie's family online.

The 42-year-old was dragged into her living room struck in the leg by Moss with a bat and repeatedly hit by Smylie.

Smylie now of Huyton admitted affray at the start of a trial on the basis no weapon was used.

Smylie formerly of the Hough Green Widnes has six previous convictions for seven offences including assault causing actual bodily harm in 2009.

Judge Aubrey handed her 12 months in jail suspended for 18 months with a 25-day Rehabilitation Activity Requirement.

Smylie and Moss both received five-year restraining orders.

Moss was jailed for 21 months for his part in the incident.

Frederick Clague

An OAP driver who killed a cyclist after driving over him at a roundabout was spared jail.

Frederick Clague was driving a Vauxhall Astra when he failed to see Simon Jones already on the roundabout on his bicycle.

Clague collided with Mr Jones on Market Street at the junction of Station Road in Hoylake Wirral and struggled to stop the car.

Witnesses watched in horror on November 27 2019 as the 88-year-old failed to stop the car driving over the trapped cyclist.

Locals pulled the car off Mr Jones but he sadly died four days later from his injuries.

Clague of Bertram Drive Meols Wirral has no previous convictions.

He admitted one charge of causing death by careless driving.

Clague was handed a 16 week curfew which will run from 8pm to 8am and was disqualified from driving for three years after which he must take an extended retest.

Leanne Pearson

A drug driving mum who had taken cocaine with a friend while her daughter was cared for by her mum was spared jail because of her children.

Other features include the Apostles without Judas a citadel representing heaven and the jaws of Hell. Christ bleeding from the nails and with a gaping wound in his side is flanked by his mother Mary and John the Baptist.

Mr Lawes said: “The church’s original Doom it is thought was painted in the 1420s or 1430s and was plastered over during the Reformation.

“The Victorians uncovered it in 1884 but since then it has suffered further and it is now hard to discern.

“So it was a genuine thrill to be asked to recreate it using traditional techniques. A great deal of research had been done on the original with regard to the pigments used.

“And with the knowledge gained from examining the country’s more complete paintings I was able to interpret the Woodham Ferrers’ version.

“It is not as big as the original but I hope it captures the colour and drama and that it provides a sense of what worshippers would once have been looking at as they attended services.

“We are not used to our churches being decorated with bright coloured paintings but it was once common.”

‘Desire to bring the painting to life’

Nia McIntosh a heritage consultant using money from the National Heritage Lottery Fund has overseen a wide Heritage Hub project at St Mary’s.

She said: “The original Doom has been through a lot over the years. It was damaged in a storm in 1989 and has deteriorated further despite conservation interventions.

“It’s now very hard to see which was why we wanted to find out what it had looked like originally and create a new version. We were able to with money from the Friends of Friendless Churches.

“My desire was to bring the painting to life for our visitors and congregation; to create more of an immersive experience and transport people back to the medieval period.

“Steve is an expert in this area and he examined the parts that remain of the original and studied documentary evidence from examinations since it re-emerged in 1884.

“Tests were done on the remaining paint to establish exactly what pigments were used and examination into extant Dooms enabled an interpretation which is as close as we can get.

“I’m sure there hasn’t been a Doom painting using traditional techniques created for a parish church since the Reformation.

“St Mary’s has other medieval paintings and decorations and we are currently hosting an exhibition and events to celebrate it.”

The exhibition Doom and discovery; wall paintings in the medieval church runs until the middle of June.

Other experts involved include Sara Charles a medieval book production expert who hand made the original recipe pigments and the brushes.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vbmV3cy91ay1lbmdsYW5kLWh1bWJlci02ODk4OTQ5M9IBN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vbmV3cy91ay1lbmdsYW5kLWh1bWJlci02ODk4OTQ5My5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hull: Oldest overseas Danish Church marks anniversary,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5saXZpbmdzdG9uZGFpbHkuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvbG9jYWwvY29tbXVuaXR5L3BpbmNrbmV5LzIwMjQvMDUvMTIvaGlzdG9yaWMtY2h1cmNoLWluLXBpbmNrbmV5LXJlbW92ZXMtc3RlZXBsZS10by1yZXBhaXItcm9vZi83MzYyNTg3OTAwNy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Historic church in Pinckney removes steeple to repair roof,"No commitment required.

Thailand’s Central Group and Austrian real estate company Signa Group which already jointly own major department stores across Europe said on Thursday they had struck a deal for the chain best known for its Oxford Street store in London.

The Canadian wing of the billionaire Weston family bought Selfridges for nearly £600 million in 2003.

Central Group owned by the billionaire Chirathivat family and Austrian investor Rene Benko’s Signa together own department stores in Germany Italy Denmark and Switzerland.

Founded in 1908 the Selfridges Group employs 10000 people and owns 25 stores worldwide including in major cities in England Ireland the Netherlands and Canada.

Signa and Central will take over 18 of the 25 stores and hope to build a luxury hotel alongside the Oxford Street flagship the source said adding that seven department stores in Canada were not part of the package.

With Selfridges they hope to build a luxury department store empire complemented by an online business.

The source said they plan to increase sales to 8 billion euros ($9.1 billion) by 2024 - including more than 1 billion online - from around 5 billion now.

The conglomerate will be managed from a holding company in London with the potential for an eventual stock exchange listing although local management of the stores in other countries will remain the source said.

Central opened its first department store in 1956 growing to become Thailand’s largest mall owner with about 2400 retail stores. It has an e-commerce joint venture with China’s JD.com and stakes in Southeast Asia ride-hailer Grab Holdings .

Central has been present in Europe since 2011 when it bought the upmarket Italian department store chain La Rinascente SpA for 205 million euros. In 2013 it also acquired Illum Denmark’s oldest department store.

In 2015 Central bought a majority stake in three luxury department stores in Germany from Signa. Central and Signa last year together bought Swiss luxury store Globus and other assets for more than 1 billion Swiss francs ($1.1 billion).

Central and Signa have also teamed up with Japanese retail giant Aeon Co to develop an e-commerce platform for one of the fastest growing online sports retail markets in the world.

Kesehatan mental juga penting diperhatikan selayaknya kesehatan fisik. Kesehatan mental merupakan komponen mendasar dari definisi kesehatan. Kesehatan mental yang baik memungkinkan orang untuk menyadari potensi mereka mengatasi tekanan kehidupan yang normal bekerja secara produktif dan berkontribusi pada komunitas mereka.

Definisi kesehatan mental menurut WHO adalah kondisi kesejahteraan (well-being) seorang individu yang menyadari kemampuannya sendiri dapat mengatasi tekanan kehidupan yang normal dapat bekerja secara produktif dan mampu memberikan kontribusi kepada komunitasnya.

Berdasarkan UU Nomor 18 Tahun 2014 tentang Kesehatan Jiwa kesehatan jiwa didefinisikan sebagai kondisi dimana seorang individu dapat berkembang secara fisik mental spiritual dan sosial sehingga individu tersebut menyadari kemampuan sendiri dapat mengatasi tekanan dapat bekerja secara produktif dan mampu memberikan kontribusi untuk komunitasnya.

Pada usia remaja (15-24 tahun) memiliki persentase depresi sebesar 62%. Depresi berat akan mengalami kecenderungan untuk menyakiti diri sendiri (self harm) hingga bunuh diri. Sebesar 80 – 90% kasus bunuh diri merupakan akibat dari depresi dan kecemasan. Kasus bunuh diri di Indonesia bisa mencapai 10.000 atau setara dengan setiap satu jam terdapat kasus bunuh diri. Menurut ahli suciodologist 4.2% siswa di Indonesia pernah berpikir bunuh diri. Pada kalangan mahasiswa sebesar 69% mempunyai niatan untuk bunuh diri sedangkan 3% lain pernah melakukan percobaan bunuh diri. Depresi pada remaja bisa diakibatkan oleh beberapa hal salah satunya ketika putus cinta.

Remaja saat ini pasti merasakan yang namanya jatuh cinta. Ketika sedang jatuh cinta ia akan memfokuskan perhatiannya pada seseorang. Awalnya jatuh cinta memang membuat kita menjadi orang paling bahagia di dunia akan tetapi ketika kita dikecewakan oleh cinta itu langsung membuat kita merasa down seketika. Putus cinta bisa disebabkan oleh beberapa hal seperti selingkuh perbedaan agama dan yang paling sering terjadi di Indonesia adalah putus cinta karena orang tua tidak setuju mengenai hubungan sang anak.

Saat menjalani hubungan sebuah konflik pasti terjadi yang menimbulkan perdebatan antara pasangan. Dilihat dari teori konflik putus cinta merupakan keadaan ketika adanya suatu permasalahan yang disebabkan oleh perbedaan suatu pendapat di antara keduanya. Lalu adanya sikap tidak bisa menerima sebuah transformasi dalam hubungan. Ralf Daherndorf yang merupakan salah satu tokoh teori konflik menyatakan bahwa masalah yang terjadi secara berulang-ulang akan menciptakan sebuah perubahan.

Remaja saat ini berpikir bahwa dengan adanya cinta hidupnya akan lebih terasa bahagia dan menyenangkan. Memang jatuh cinta membuat kita bahagia namun ketika terjadi putus cinta Terkadang kesedihan dan kekecewaan mendalam yang dirasakan anak muda akan berujung pada tindakan negatif seperti self harm dan minum minuman keras. Banyak terdapat kasus anak muda yang memutuskan bunuh diri setelah mengalami putus cinta. Hal itu dikarenakan perasaan sedih yang mandalam sulit untuk menerima kenyataan merasa menderita merasa tidak bahagia dan lain sebagainya.

Oleh karena itu kita harus bisa menerima kenyataan walaupun kenyataan itu pahit. Jangan sampai kita melukai diri karena putus cinta karena hidup kita jauh lebih berharga daripada yang kita pikirkan. Melepaskan sesuatu adalah keinginan untuk mengubah keyakinanmu untuk membawa lebih banyak kedamaian dan kegembiraan ke dalam hidupmu alih-alih berpegang pada keyakinan yang membawa rasa sakit dan penderitaan.

“Waktu tidak menyembuhkan rasa sakitmu kamu hanya perlu belajar bagaimana melepaskannya”

Menurut cerita masyarakat Danau Toba bermula dari seorang pemuda bernama Toba seorang

yatim piatu. Sehari-hari dia bekerja sebagai petani dan mencari ikan di sungai yang tidak jauh

dari rumahnya.

Pada suatu hari ketika memancing di sungai Toba mendapatkan seekor ikan mas berukuran besar. Namun karena sisik ini terlihat berkilau dan cantik Toba memutuskan membawa pulang dan memeliharanya.

Ternyata kekaguman Toba terhadap sisik ikan berwarna emas ini tidak berhenti sampai disana. Setelah ditangkap ikan mas itu menjelma menjadi seorang perempuan berparas cantik.

Toba jatuh cinta melihat kecantikan sang puteri. Bahkan Toba memutuskan untuk menikahinya meski sang puteri memberikan persyaratan. Yaitu Toba harus berjanji merahasiakan asal usulnya pada siapapun.

Kisah Danau Toba Berdasarkan Sains

Ditinjau daari geologist asal usul Danau Toba tidak telepas dari sejarah letusan super dasyat

yang membentuk danau kaldera ini. Hal ini diungkapkan oleh Van Bemmelen geolog asal Belanda dalam bukunya The Geology of Indonesia (1939). Buku tersebut mengungkapkan hipotesis mengenai proses terbentuknya Danau Toba.

Menurut Bemmelen awalnya gunung api purba ini melakukan aktivitas vulkanik dan terjadi erupsi sangat dasyat.

Gabungan proses vulkanik dan tektonik pada letusan gunung api purba inilah yang menyebabkan amblesnya gunung sehingga membentuk cekungan memanjang ke arah barat laut hingga tenggara.

Letusan tersebut juga menyababkan terjungkitnya sebagian tanah dengan posisi miring ke arah barat daya yang membentuk Pulau Samosir.

Sehingga ada saja orang membuat harapan bahwa cinta pertama menjadi cinta selamanya dalam hidupnya. Namun kalau takdir telah berkata lain maka kamu pun harus menerimanya dengan lapang dada. Maka dari itu buanglah pikiran-pikiran yang tidak realistis di benakmu misalnya saja “Aku tak akan pernah menemukan cinta selain dirinya” atau “Hidupku tidak akan bahagia kalau tidak bersamanya.” Jika kamu percaya bahwa dirimu mampu menyembuhkan luka di hatimu semua rasa sakit itu bukanlah menjadi sebuah kesialan namun suatu ujian agar kamu bisa memperkaya hatimu.

2. Fokus pada masa sekarang dan masa depan ilustrasi bekerja (pexels.com/Vlada Karpovich) Kalau sudah patah hati atau terbayang-bayang dengan kenangan cinta pertama biasanya memakan waktu yang cukup lama untuk menghilangkannya. Daripada kamu harus menghabiskan waktumu memikir si dia yang telah pergi lebih baik kamu mulai fokus pada dirimu sendiri. Bagaimanapun juga terus terjebak dalam kenangan masa lalu bukanlah hal yang baik. Maka dari itu carilah kegiatan yang bermanfaat atau merencanakan ulang impianmu yang ingin kamu raih. Saat inilah waktu yang tepat untukmu agar bisa bersinar menata hidup yang lebih baik. Sehingga memori terhadap kenangan masa lalu bisa terkikis karena dirimu telah disibukkan dengan beragam kegiatan yang kamu lakukan.

Until recently multicloud deployments were more often about managing workloads running in multiple clouds Zeus Kerravala principal analyst at ZK Research told SDxCentral.

“I take workload A and I put it in cloud one and I take workload B and I put it in cloud two. So I’m using multiple clouds but it’s not multicloud in the sense that I’m actually building an app that will pull resources from both clouds” he said. But with “the rise of composite applications that’s actually what’s happening.”

This in conjunction with edge compute coming under the cloud umbrella is driving the need for a very different kind of WAN Kerravala explained.

Over the past two years multicloud platforms have steadily gained traction and today there is a veritable grab bag of eccentric personalities toting “novel” platform approaches. Several vendors including Alkira Aviatrix and Prosimo have seen early successes in the space — especially among large distributed enterprises — and the SD-WAN vendors have taken notice.

Networking Follows Compute

“Network changes have always tracked along the lines of computing” Kerravala said. “We didn’t really need WANs until we started doing PC computing. We didn’t really need SD-WAN until we started doing cloud computing.”

Now as the definition of the cloud evolves to include the edge and applications begin spanning multiple providers the WAN is once again undergoing a metamorphosis he explained. “That compute evolution is driving the need for a different kind of WAN.”

One of the biggest challenges facing existing SD-WAN architectures is the ephemeral nature of the edge and the cloud-native applications running on it.

Due to the limited resources available to an edge location an application may only run as long as it needs to before shutting itself down again. By comparison the cloud and the virtual machines running on it are relatively stable and the connections to them more permanent.

“When you start dealing with edge computing it’s the first time ever we’ve actually had to connect compute resources that were this ephemeral in nature” Kerravala said.

There are two ways of approaching this challenge according to Kerravala. The first is by maintaining a connection to the workload which comes at the expense of higher costs and an increased attack surface. Meanwhile the second is to extend that ephemerality to the network so that the connection only lasts as long as the workload is running.

The latter is the approach championed by many of the emerging multicloud vendors including Aviatrix and Alkira.

SD-WAN’s Evolution to the multicloud

That’s not to say the SD-WAN vendors have been sleeping on the job. Cisco VMware and Fortinet — three of the leading SD-WAN vendors by marketshare — for example have retooled their platforms in recent months to address growing demand for multicloud networking.

Cisco’s recent ThousandEyes integration opened the door to automatically route traffic across middle-mile networks that are instantiated on demand and then torn down again when they’re no longer needed.

Likewise VMware is leaning on the distributed nature of its VeloCloud SD-WAN platform to be the hub for connecting applications running across multiple clouds.

The SD-WAN vendors also have something the multicloud startups don’t: a large customer install base looking for ways to apply their existing investments as a remedy to their multicloud management migraines. This advantage has made helping the SD-WAN vendors accelerate development of these technologies a lucrative opportunity for the public cloud providers on which the applications reside.

Earlier this month Amazon Web Services (AWS) unveiled Cloud WAN a managed service designed to streamline the process of connecting on-premises data centers and branch offices to the cloud provider’s global backbone network.

The service isn’t unique and rival cloud providers Google and Microsoft offer nearly identical functionality via Network Connectivity Center and Azure vWAN respectively. Megaport Equinix and Apcela also offer similar functionality over their respective networks.

These services have quickly garnered support from SD-WAN vendors that see it as an opportunity to streamline deployments and offer MPLS-like performance that can be initiated in a matter of minutes.

If the cloud providers can pull this off — which is something Kerravala isn’t entirely convinced of yet — “that’ll be really appealing to companies because you would drop the cost and you could make it very ephemeral.”

And while AWS and its contemporaries aren’t going to usurp the telcos anytime soon Kerravala argues the competition could force operators’ hands and drive innovation in the field.

“I think the good thing with AWS is they don’t really shy away from competition. In fact I think they like the competition because it makes everybody better ” he said.

Who Stands to Win the Multicloud Race

These cloud integrations come as networking vendors move to expand their security capabilities and roll out ever more capable secure access service edge (SASE) products.

Even multicloud vendors have announced security features and integrations in recent months to assuage their customer’s security concerns. Earlier this year Alkira announced integrations first with Palo Alto Networks and later Check Point. Just last week it added Cisco firewalls to the list.

Meanwhile Aviatrix recently added threat feeds to its multicloud orchestration offering.

Heading into the new year Kerravala says it’s the large companies like Cisco or Palo Alto Networks with broad portfolios that have the advantage.

“It’s almost like we’re moving from best of breed to best of suite” he said. “You’ve got to have not just the best infrastructure technology but I think you need to have a lot of the other tools and capabilities and analytics to be able to address that going forward.”

Unsurprisingly it’s security capabilities that Kerravala says will make the difference. “The two really interesting companies that could have a big impact are Fortinet and Palo [Alto Networks] just because they’ve got a lot of capabilities from the security side of things” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsZWVwaW5nY29tcHV0ZXIuY29tL25ld3Mvc2VjdXJpdHkvYmxhY2ttYWdpYy1maXhlcy1jcml0aWNhbC1kYXZpbmNpLXJlc29sdmUtY29kZS1leGVjdXRpb24tZmxhd3Mv0gFyaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxlZXBpbmdjb21wdXRlci5jb20vbmV3cy9zZWN1cml0eS9ibGFja21hZ2ljLWZpeGVzLWNyaXRpY2FsLWRhdmluY2ktcmVzb2x2ZS1jb2RlLWV4ZWN1dGlvbi1mbGF3cy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Blackmagic fixes critical DaVinci Resolve code execution flaws,"Blackmagic Software has recently addressed two security vulnerabilities in the highly popular DaVinci Resolve software that would allow attackers to gain code execution on unpatched systems.

DaVinci Resolve is a free software platform that combines video editing and color correction visual effects motion graphics and audio post-production tools in a single solution.

As its developer Blackmagic claims DaVinci Resolve is ""Hollywood's most popular solution for editing"" for Mac Windows and Linux.

Critical remote code execution flaws

The two remote code execution (RCE) security flaws tracked as CVE-2021-40417 and CVE-2021-40418 were discovered by Cisco Talos security researchers and are rated with a CVSSv3 severity score of 9.8/10.

They're both caused by weaknesses found in DaVinci Resolve's DPDecoder service and are triggered by a heap-based buffer overflow when decoding a video file or an incorrect UUID when parsing video files.

""[CVE-2021-40417] is a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability that occurs when the application faces an integer overflow condition that leads to a sign extension while trying to decode a video file"" Cisco Talos explained.

""Alternatively [CVE-2021-40418] could also lead to code execution but is instead triggered as the result of an uninitialized object member as a result of an incorrect UUID.""

The bugs can be exploited by remote threat actors in low complexity attacks with successful exploitation not requiring authentication or user interaction.

Patches available

Cisco Talos discovered the two code execution vulnerabilities while analyzing DaVinci Resolve version 17.3.1.0005.

Blackmagic has since patched both bugs and users are advised to update to DaVinci Resolve 17.4.3 the latest released version for their platform as soon as possible.

""Cisco Talos worked with Blackmagic to ensure that these issues are resolved and an update is available for affected customers"" the Cisco Talos team said.

“We’re gonna have our best year ever from a strategic standpoint. Then we also have the deal of the year. What else can you ask for?” UnionBank president and chief executive officer Edwin Bautista told The STAR in a virtual interview.

MANILA Philippines — Union Bank of the Philippines is shelling out around P55 billion for the acquisition of the consumer banking business of global banking giant Citi in the Philippines.

“We’re gonna have our best year ever from a strategic standpoint. Then we also have the deal of the year. What else can you ask for?” UnionBank president and chief executive officer Edwin Bautista told The STAR in a virtual interview.

Confirming a report by The STAR early this month UnionBank announced yesterday that it has entered into a share and business transfer agreement with various subsidiaries of Citigroup to acquire Citi’s consumer banking business in the Philippines.

He said the net asset value of Citi’s retail business is about P9.7 billion with a premium of about P45.3 billion.

Bautista said Citibank Philippines has a great profitable and well-run retail portfolio as it has the third largest credit card franchise and is a pre-eminent wealth management provider in the country.

“We look forward to this game-changing opportunity to leapfrog our credit card business and significantly expand our banking business in the higher end segment of the consumer market” Bautista said.

He added that there are clear synergistic opportunities in the engagement.

“We intend to learn from Citi’s expertise to enable UnionBank to effectively build on its success and take the business to the next level. As we embark on this journey we are committed to retain all of Citi’s key talents and uphold the superior customer experience that Citi has delivered to its customers over the years” Bautista said.

The leading digitally transformed and most innovative bank in the country is set to absorb close to 1750 employees including senior management of Citi.

UnionBank chairman Erramon Isidro Aboitiz said the bank is looking forward to welcoming all Citi employees as both banks have strong cultural similarities.

“This acquisition further cements our position as a leading bank in the Philippines as well as fast-tracks our growth aspirations in the retail banking segment” Aboitiz said.

UnionBank chief finance officer and treasurer Jose Emmanuel Hilado said the country’s seventh largest lender is raising as much as P40 billion via a stock rights offer to bankroll the acquisition.

Hilado told The STAR the projected timing of the stock rights offering is scheduled in March next year in time for the completion of the transaction with Citi as early as July.

Existing shareholders including Aboitiz Equity Ventures The Insular Life Assurance Co. Inc. and state pension fund manager Social Security System committed to fully subscribe to their respective allocations as well as to any shares not taken up by other shareholders.

Hilado said the fund-raising activity is enough to augment the bank’s capital buffer as well as earnings to finance the transaction.

In relation to the acquisition of Citigroup’s consumer banking business UnionBank said the transaction value is not yet final and is still subject to regulatory approvals.

For its part Citi said UnionBank would pay a cash consideration for the net assets of the acquired businesses plus a premium of P45.3 billion subject to customary closing adjustments.

Upon closing Citi expects the transaction to result in the release of approximately $300 million of allocated tangible common equity as well as an increase to tangible common equity of approximately $500 million.

Citi Asia Pacific chief executive officer Peter Babej said in a separate statement that the transaction represents a positive outcome for its clients colleagues and the company.

“We are delivering on our renewed strategy focusing resources in areas where our global network positions us to deliver optimal growth and returns. Citi will continue to serve institutional clients in the Philippines and across Asia Pacific as we have for over a century. We are very pleased with today’s announcement and we will use the capital generated to invest in our strategic priorities” Babej said.

Citi said it picked UnionBank following an extensive and competitive auction process. It added it remains committed to a seamless transaction and during the transition to closing there would be no change in service provided to its consumer banking and wealth customers.

The closing of the transaction is expected in the second half of 2022 subject to the timing of regulatory approvals.

Aside from Citi’s credit card personal loans wealth management and retail deposit businesses the acquisition also includes Citi’s real estate interests in relation to Citibank Square in Eastwood three full service bank branches five wealth centers and two bank branch lite units.

Citi Philippines’ institutional business provides a comprehensive range of services to over 950 multinational corporations as well as leading local corporates including 90 percent of the top 20 companies by market capitalization on the Philippine Stock Exchange.

Citi’s consumer banking operations including call centers online and mobile banking services will continue to serve their clients.

“Customers will be contacted in the coming months with more details” UnionBank said. “Citi will continue to operate its institutional business in the Philippines.”

Asian Institute of Management Economist John Paolo R. Rivera expects more merger and acquisition deals in the local banking industry.

“Mergers and acquisitions would persist given the uncertainties in financial markets and the changing preferences of clients that other banks can address” he said in a Viber message.

UnionBank shares closed P8.60 lower at P101.20 apiece on Thursday after the local bourse approved a one-hour voluntary trading halt in the morning. — Luz Wendy T. Noble",,,,,,

Ally Bank Account Denial Class Action Lawsuit Overview:

Who: A woman who was brought to the United States as a child and is allowed to work under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program is suing Ally Bank.

Why: The woman says the bank denied her an account because she is not a U.S. citizen or legal permanent resident in violation of the law.

Where: The class action lawsuit was filed in a California federal court.

Ally Bank illegally denies non-United States residents access to bank accounts even if they are legally allowed to work in the country a new class action lawsuit alleges.

Plaintiff Mariela Aguilar Velazquez filed the class action complaint against Ally Bank Dec. 20 in a California federal court alleging violations of the Civil Rights Act and California Civil Code.

Aguilar is a recipient of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.

DACA is a policy that allows immigrants who were brought to the United States as children to receive a renewable two-year period of deferred action from deportation and become eligible for a work permit in the U.S.

Aguilar has had authorization to work in the United States and a Social Security Number since 2012. However in Nov. 2020 she says when she went to open a checking and savings account with Ally Bank she was unlawfully denied.

“Plaintiff Aguilar received a phone call from an Ally Bank representative informing Plaintiff Aguilar that she is ineligible to open a checking and savings account with Ally Bank because she is not a U.S. citizen or an Legal Permanent Resident” the lawsuit says. “Plaintiff Aguilar asked the representative whether this denial was allowed by law. The representative answered that it is Ally Bank’s policy to deny anyone who is not a U.S. citizen or permanent resident.”

Plaintiff Claims No Other Bank Denied Her An Account Because Of Immigration Status

Aguilar is alleging unlawful discrimination on the basis of alienage in violation of the Civil Rights Act and the Unruh Civil Rights Act as codified at California Civil Code. She said no other bank has denied her a bank account because of her immigration status.

“Plaintiff Aguilar suffered harm as a result of Ally Bank’s denial of her checking and savings account application because of her alienage” the lawsuit states. “Ally Bank’s denial of her application caused Plaintiff Aguilar to suffer emotional distress.”

She’s seeking to represent anyone in the United States who was denied a bank account from Ally Bank on the basis of alienage plus a California class.

She’s seeking certification of the class action an injunction damages fees costs and a jury trial.

In 2020 Wells Fargo agreed to pay a $20 million settlement to DACA recipients whose loan applications were denied by Wells Fargo.

(Yong Kim / Staff Photographer) Read more

Bob McCammon who had two stints as a Flyers coach — he followed Fred Shero and Pat Quinn men who later reached the Hockey Hall of Fame — died Thursday. He was 80.

Mr. McCammon also served as the Flyers general manager for one year.

He was director of player development for the Edmonton Oilers when they hoisted the Stanley Cup in 1987 and was a Detroit scout when the Red Wings won Cups in 2002 and 2008.

According to The Province Mr. McCammon was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s several years ago.

Mr. McCammon nicknamed “Cagey” was fired as the Flyers coach and replaced by Quinn in 1979. Late in the 1981-82 season Quinn was fired and replaced by Mr. McCammon.

When he returned for his first game at the Spectrum the fans seemed indifferent.

“Well no reaction is favorable at this time” Mr. McCammon said at the time. “I’m just here to do a job not run for mayor.”

In 1978-79 Mr. McCammon at age 37 had a tough act to follow in his first season as the Flyers coach. He became the fourth coach in franchise history when he replaced Shero who had directed the Flyers to Stanley Cups in 1974 and 1975 and a 308-151-95 record in his seven seasons. Shero resigned because he felt “my effectiveness to motivate the players … has been exhausted.”

The Flyers got off to a 22-17-11 start under Mr. McCammon and he was replaced by Quinn. Under Quinn the team went 18-8-4 the rest of the season and made the playoffs and the Flyers reached the Stanley Cup Finals the next season (1979-80) one that included a record 35-game unbeaten streak.

Mr. McCammon replaced Quinn and coached the final eight games in 1981-82.

Quinn was more of a taskmaster while Mr. McCammon would hang out with the players at one of their South Jersey drinking spots said left winger Brian Propp who played for both coaches.

Mr. McCammon “liked to have fun. He kind of knew what he had to do [as a coach]” Propp said on Friday. “We had good leaders on the team. Pat Quinn was more strategic and Bob liked to joke around and say funny things to the players” to get them motivated. “Everybody loved him and we had good times with him.”

The Flyers went 49-23-8 under Mr. McCammon in 1982-83 with a team that included veterans Bobby Clarke Bill Barber Darryl Sittler Mark Howe and a host of promising younger players such as goaltender Pelle Lindbergh.

Led by young stars Tim Kerr Propp and Dave Poulin the Flyers compiled a 44-26-10 record in 1983-84 Mr. McCammon’s final season as their coach. The team lost in the first round of the playoffs in Mr. McCammon’s last two seasons with the Flyers getting swept and extending their playoff losing streak to nine games under him.

Prior to his first stint with the Flyers Mr. McCammon coached the franchise’s AHL farm team the Maine Mariners and led them to the Calder Cup in 1977.

Mr. McCammon became the Flyers’ general manager at the end of the 1982-83 season and still remained as the team’s coach.

After the next season Mr. McCammon and the Flyers agreed to part ways. The Flyers had wanted him to concentrate on just his GM duties and give up coaching. Mr. McCammon wanted to continue in both roles.

“I felt that it was ineffective for one man to do both jobs” Jay Snider then the club’s president said at the time.

Bobby Clarke (GM) and Mike Keenan (coach) replaced Mr. McCammon.

The Flyers had a 119-68-31 record (.617 points percentage) under the coaching of Mr. McCammon who later spent four years coaching the Vancouver Canucks and directing them to a 102-156-36 record.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vY29sbGlkZXIuY29tL21vdmllcy1saWtlLWdvaW5nLWluLXN0eWxlLXRvLXdhdGNoLWhlaXN0LWJ1ZGR5LWZpbG1zL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,15 Movies Like 'Going In Style' for More Feel-Good Buddy Movies & Underrated Heist Films,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vY29sbGlkZXIuY29tL21vdmllcy1saWtlLWdvaW5nLWluLXN0eWxlLXRvLXdhdGNoLWhlaXN0LWJ1ZGR5LWZpbG1zL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhdmluZ2FkdmljZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjAyMS8xMi8yNC8xMDkxMjg3X2FyZS1iYW5rcy1jbG9zZWQtb24tbmV3LXllYXJzLWV2ZS0yMDIxLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Are Banks Closed on New Year's Eve 2021?,,,,

By The Editors and Friends

With these brief snapshots of wonderful people many of whom have appeared on our pages we honor those we have lost this year. We will remember them always. If you dreamed about them you’d wake up smiling. Those were the sort of friends they were.

Virgil Abloh

Virgil Abloh the transcendent designer creative director and entrepreneur worked so prolifically across the mediums of music art and fashion that he managed to revolutionize entire industries in his brief 41 years on earth. Trained as an architect he designed an entire way of life for legions of young people. I know this for certain because my 14-year-old son shared the sad news of his passing with me. He is one of those young people who can’t get enough of Virgil’s album covers his clothes his DJ sets at music festivals. That kind of reach is incredible.

Virgil’s irreverent streetwear at Off-White led to Louis Vuitton where he infused a sense of joy into the menswear and accessories of the storied house. That joy and his wonderful willingness to express it made Virgil unique among fashion insiders who so often pride themselves on ennui and disillusionment.

How lucky we were to have this spirit living and working among us and committed to creating unique experiences right here in our (and his) beloved Chicago. From the MCA exhibit to the talks Virgil gave at the museum and the phenomenally vibrant Louis Vuitton pop-up shop we had glimpses into his truly inventive mind.

So many Chicagoans benefitted from moments with Virgil. These musicians artists and designers will carry on inspired by this lovely man reminding us always that Virgil was here.

Well done. Rest well.

Geoffrey Atkins

A world racquets champion for 18 years straight who spent an important period of his life in Chicago and Lake Forest Geoffrey Atkins is widely regarded as one of the greatest players of the quintessentially British sport a game played indoors with a hard ball rocketing about at such speed that competitors could get killed if struck by it.

“As the game is quite dangerous you have to concentrate” the English-born Atkins told me many years ago. “There wasn’t much fooling around on the court during a match. I was excited by the speed of the game and the satisfaction of getting hard shots back.

“Rackets has been one of the most important influences of my life.”

He first earned the world championship in 1954 – a year after Queen Elizabeth was crowned – and held it until 1972 before retiring undefeated. In addition Geoffrey was an excellent squash player capturing the Chicago City Squash Championship in 1955-56 among his other titles. He was an avid recreational tennis player and golfer well into his 70s and during the Wimbledon fortnight the Englishman could often be found watching matches at Centre Court.

Timuel Black

Civil rights activist educator author and historian. (1918-2021) was for many the face of Chicago history. The great-grandson of slaves and the son of sharecroppers who came to Chicago during the Great Migration he grew up in Bronzeville graduated from DuSable High School and Roosevelt University earning his masters from the University of Chicago. A teacher for over four decades at area high schools and colleges he was an organizer of the Chicago contingent for the 1963 March on Washington and urged Harold Washington to run for mayor. Heralded by U.S. Senator Dick Durban as “for me and so many others—a personal hero” Black received many honors for his service in World War II and his writings and civil rights work. He received the University of Chicago’s prestigious Benton Medal for Distinguished Public Service in 2017.

Richard Driehaus

Richard Driehaus thoughtful philanthropist brilliant businessman dedicated preservationist enthusiastic museum founder was quick to laugh eager to throw a party and eternally honing a work ethic nurtured by his parents and the Catholic schools he attended and burnished on the floors of his investment firm Driehaus Capital Management LLC.

Richard died of natural causes on March 9 2021 at the age of 78. He was a larger-than-life figure whose magnetic personality was matched only by his enormous generosity. Both individually and through the work of The Richard H. Driehaus Foundation and the Richard H. Driehaus Charitable Lead Trusts he supported an array of different organization and initiatives including many in and around Chicago.

In 2003 Richard Driehaus set out to restore the 1883 Nickerson Mansion to create a public space to share his passion for late 19th century arts and culture architecture and design. The Museum is just part the grand legacy of this self-made Chicagoan. Today his entrepreneurial positive and resilient spirit echoes the spirit of those of who came before him who built and rebuilt the historic corridor of East Erie Street. As he carried their torch forward those of us entrusted with his charitable legacy will assume his mantle of lifelong learning the importance of giving back approaching one’s endeavors as a masterpiece and the unyielding belief in the power of art and architecture to inspire minds

Dr. Lester Fisher

If animals can speak on Christmas Eve as some believe there was a cacophony of praise murmured amidst the Zoo Lights at the Lincoln Park Zoo from creatures great and small celebrating Dr. Lester Fisher who died just days ago at 100. In his four decades of leadership he transformed the Zoo making it an international leader in conservation and care of animals an institution celebrated around the world and a welcoming spot at no cost for Chicago. Quiet in nature Fisher knew how to listen to both people and animals. Early on his director’s office was located in the monkey house and he developed a love for gorillas particularly the famous Bushman. He related recently how he loved to visit him and talk a bit. He came to the Zoo as a part time veterinarian just after World War II having had a chance assignment of looking after General Patton’s bulldog Willie. When the legendary Marlin Perkins left for the St. Louis Zoo in 1962 Fisher became Zoo Director and served for four decades. Perhaps most famous as a leader in the conserving gorillas he transformed the Zoo into a happy home for all animals and a place to go during tough pandemic times.

Pamela Kelley Hull

Pamela Kelley Hull died in Lake Forest on November 10 age 93. She was the granddaughter of Stanley Field longtime head of the Field Museum of Natural History and a nephew of the first Marshall Field. A native of Cheshire England Stanley may well have inspired Pam’s enduring affinity familiar to all her friends for Anglo culture and the British country house. A walk through Pam’s well-made garden told the tale. A collaboration with the renowned designer John Brookes it was a colorful and enchanting “English muddle” of delphinium clematis and lush David Austin roses. She loved the lore of gardens too and her research into the records of the Lake Forest Garden Club (which she served as president 1978-80) uncovered a trove of glass lantern slides picturing many lakefront gardens now lost to history. Her aesthetic interests took her further afield to London and courses sponsored by the Attingham Trust in which she explored many facets of British landed estates and their vast holdings of pictures books porcelain and textiles. She became something of an expert herself.

Pam was married first to Vernon Armour with whom she had four children (Linda Kelly Cynthia Landreth Vernon K. and Gordon F.) and later remarried to Roger B. Hull. She was generous to many Chicago and national cultural institutions. A last major benevolence was her lead contribution to the restoration of an elaborate overmantel by the 17th c. master carver Grinling Gibbons a work long in storage and scheduled to go on display at the Art Institute late this spring. Godspeed Pam with our gratitude.

~ Helmut Jahn

There is a reason so many preservationists have advocated for repurposing and reinvesting in Helmut Jahn’s architecture. Jahn was a groundbreaking and evocative designer who brought us some of the world’s most bold and memorable spaces. Far from mundane his public spaces are awe inspiring. His mastery of scale and proportion created spaces that continue to amaze and inspire those who visit.

Landmarks Illinois partnered with Jahn for many years to imagine a reuse for his one-of-a-kind James R. Thompson Center in Chicago. We have called attention to the long-threatened Post Modern building on our Most Endangered Historic Places in Illinois four times since 2017 and remain committed to preserving his design vision. Today we await the National Park Service’s final decision on a nomination we commissioned to include the Thompson Center on the National Register of Historic Places making it one of the first buildings from this period designated as historic in the United States.

Jahn was unapologetic about bringing his bold ideas to life. Now it is our job to preserve the work of this masterful provocateur who helped to distinguish Chicago’s skyline from every other city. We look forward to the reuse of both the Thompson Center and his Lakefront Center as exciting destinations and remain committed to protecting Helmut Jahn’s unique and dynamic design legacy.

Jan Jentes

Jan Jentes whose self-effacing and quiet manner might belie her dynamic leadership of so many community and cultural organizations including those at the Art Institute of Chicago is remembered by her 19-year-old grandson Lazlo Jentes a first year student at Macalester College in the poem below.

I think of you in splash of paint

On canvases you wrought anew

In carpet indentation faint

From seats that once supported you

In suits and finery adorned

Clothes worn today to softly mourn

And were you here to watch me fly

A smile on your lips would lie

So while I grieve lost love of art

Your inspiration mends my heart

And though these words were written weeping

You’re on your feet again not sleeping

In golden halls above away

Where shows and concerts for’ere replay.

Fred Krehbiel

I like so many others was blessed to have known Fred Krehbiel. In my case he was a presence since I was a little girl and guided me on many levels not the least of which was as a member of my board of directors as I founded and built my business. He always found time to listen and help regardless of how busy he was himself. Fred was a deeply loyal and caring friend who quietly sought ways large and small to help scores of people and to make a difference. He was the most generous person I have ever met. He lived by and embodied the Golden Rule and believed that all lives have equal value. His was a life well lived and for those of us to whom he was a guiding light his death leaves a permanent void.

Carey MacFarland Lennox

For those of us lucky enough to have known Carey her death from colon cancer in early May at the age of 59 robbed us of a caring and compassionate friend.

Carey lived life to the fullest. A “lifer” at Latin; a Middlebury graduate with a fluency in Italian and a love of all things Italian; a photographer who was able to capture those special unscripted moments; an artist creating stunning beaded necklaces; a connector of people who never forgot a birthday and loved to celebrate important milestones and holidays; Carey wove all this together with her career and her family.

May we celebrate knowing her and never forget her deep and generous love.

Suzanne Carbonneau Mack

The strikingly lovely and beautifully educated young woman from Montreal spotted by the handsome American who sweeps her off her feet and back to Chicago. This charming true-life story belonged to Suzanne Carbonneau and her husband Walter Mack who contributed to the fabric of our City in significant ways. For those of us who visited with Suzanne and her school friends at Murray Bay Quebec reunions we saw the savoir faire and French wit she shared throughout her life and the fun of her childhood in that cosmopolitan French Canadian hub. Her ancestors from Bordeaux were among the first European settlers in the 1600’s. Her late brother Guy served as Canadian Senator and Speaker of the Canadian Senate and another brother Pierre as a Canadian General. She loved sharing with her daughters Linda Mack and Elaine Timbers and her son Stephen Walter Mack their French connections. Beautiful of dress and of manner she reflected the je ne sais quoi of her ancestors.

A championship golfer she shared her wise skills with the Woman’s Board of Rush University Medical Center Woman’s Board of Northwestern University the Antiquarian Society of the Art Institute The Women’s Board of the Field Museum and The Contemporary Club.

Florence McMillan

Florri McMillan gave off sparks. She was smart and funny and optimistic all of which enabled her to overcome what seemed overwhelming physical challenges during her life. Although her pals managed to discourage her from learning to fly there was little else Florri wouldn’t try. Occasionally we got caught up the wake of her latest passion but none of us could match her versatility. A gifted writer Florri could present a scholarly paper to a group of academics in the morning and sponsor a one woman show of her abstract art that evening.

Now that she is free I imagine Florri is finally getting to fly making ever bigger loops as she soars gleefully through the air. 30

Jack Sandner

The youngest chairman in the history of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Jack Sandner guided what became CME Group to its perch as the world’s largest derivatives marketplace. But family was what mattered most to him.

He was omnipresent in his support of his children’s and grandchildren’s activities. Said Andy McKenna a longtime friend and chairman emeritus of McDonald’s “If there was a book about being good to your family it would be about him.”

All of his children with his wife Carole were adopted. Jack also helped other families adopt children. He embraced helping others. Said his son Chris “He was available to anyone who sought his counsel or general support. My father never gave up on anyone.”

As a boy his bare-bones apartment on the South Side was heated by a pot-bellied stove. The pugnacious youngster became a successful Golden Gloves boxer. Jack’s boxing mentor was Tony Zale and he credited a gift from him – the book The Power of Positive Thinking –– as turning his life around.

Jack is deeply missed. His impact was immense –just like billboard of his smiling face which hovered above a Chicago expressway after he passed away.

Joanne Smith

At her death on September 6 Dr. Joanne Smith received worldwide tributes for her leadership and vision as President and CEO of the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab. At that time Shirley Ryan shared Smith’s far-reaching impact as did Connie Coolidge a volunteer leader there in many capacities. Their words capture many of the reasons people admired this internationally acclaimed leader in her field.

From Shirley Ryan:

“Dr. Joanne Smith was a transformational and visionary health care leader. Her impact in the field of rehabilitation sciences will be felt globally for many generations to come. Joanne blended a culture of hope and positivity integrating scientific research technology and superior clinical care. I was honored to be her colleague and friend and will miss her always as my soul sister.”

And from Connie Coolidge:

“Joanne was a visionary with an entrepreneurial spirit. She set ambitious goals and was tenacious in reaching them quickly pivoting around any obstacles she encountered. She led by example working harder than anyone fueled by her enthusiasm for the project at hand. She was compassionate as a doctor quick to share a laugh with patients.”

Valerie Solti

Although she was born in Yorkshire and based in London while she and her husband toured international music venues Valerie Solti said she became a “total Chicagoan” the moment she landed in our town. Wife of Sir Georg Solti music director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra from 1969 until l991 she loved our architecture art and our citizens. She was the most personable person I ever knew following the lives of musicians and friends their children and grandchildren and developing opportunities for talented young musicians through the Solti Foundation she established.

Her daughters Gabrielle and Claudia and her four grandchildren brought her much happiness and she built true friendships. She was so pleased when Claudia moved to the United States. Valerie was a dedicated humanitarian who helped both people and animals.

I met Valerie when she first arrived in Chicago and moved into the Mayfair Hotel where I worked. They travelled a lot and her primary concern was that the Maestro felt at home there. A BBC broadcast journalist they met when she interviewed him. He was the love of her life. Claudia told me that her last word was Maestro.

Laura Sudler

My Mother Laura Sudler was a funny bird in many ways. A vivacious bright individual with an extremely loving heart. She spent a lifetime learning cultivating meaningful friendships and cherishing family.

She was a master of telling it like it is – with her shoot from the hip sensibility.

If she liked you…she loved you. If she didn’t…well she would tell you that too.

As a Mother she made some impressions subtly through a framed collection of sayings discretely displayed around the house. As a youngster I didn’t grasp the full meaning of these snippets of wisdom but as a parent their meaning rings true!

Here are a few that I now have hidden in my home awaiting discovery.

“Children move out now…while you still know everything”. Any parent with teenagers can see why my mother displayed this prominently.

At our summer home discreetly displayed in a lovely cross stitch: “Who invited all these tacky people?” Funny but often true!

“Ask not what your Mother can do for you. Ask what you can do for your Mother” Was displayed in the kitchen for maximum effect and minimal results.

There is one sign that Mom doesn’t have. I would like to give it to her now. It reads “Thanks for everything Mom…I love you.” I am pretty sure that one would be out for everyone to see.

Frank Sullivan

When we lost Frank Sullivan in June major Chicago media discussed Frank’s many facets including his years as an award-winning Chicago Sun-Times reporter his role as Press Secretary to Mayor Richard J. Daley and his 1989 best-selling book about the late mayor Legend.

At Classic Chicago we remember Frank best as Publisher of Avenue M which he bought in 1985 and smartened up bringing in a team that today is a core of Classic Chicago. He hired Kay Whitfield as Director of Photography assigned Judy Bross a delightful column titled Judy’s People and named this writer his Editor.

Frank lived long vital years rich years—91 in all—always learning continually growing and forever remaining in the middle of his life packing several careers and many interests into those years and stretching them out. One can scarcely have regrets but we do miss him.

(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel

India’s Minister for Power and New and Renewable Energy R.K. Singh has emphasised that reliable quality power supply and consumer satisfaction are prerequisites for the country’s accelerated economic growth.This in turn requires power distribution companies (discoms) to be financially sustainable and operationally efficient. But despite eight reform programs and financial restructuring packages (FRPs) over the past two decades aggregate discom losses in India worsened by 14.55 per cent in FY20 compared to FY17 levels (in real terms). The COVID-19 pandemic has only made matters worse.The Revamped Distribution Sector (RDS) Scheme aims to bring down discom losses within the 12-15 per cent range and align supply costs and revenue realised by FY25. Its budgetary outlay is INR 3 lakh crore spread over five years of which 32 per cent will be centrally funded. But how is it different from previous attempts to ease the financial strain on discoms? What specific steps can we take to make the RDS scheme an effective solution? Here are some answers.Like earlier FRPs the RDS scheme offers discoms conditional finance linked to the achievement of milestones. These include advance payments of tariff subsidies clearance of government department dues and liquidation of regulatory assets. Most states will struggle to meet these conditions due to the ongoing pandemic. Further tracking progress on 26 parameters will complicate the monitoring and management of the scheme—a key reason for the limited success of previous results-linked programmes.What distinguishes RDS from past efforts is its focus on compulsory smart metering infrastructure to address the recurring issue of high billing and collection inefficiency. The scheme mandates the installation of 25 crore smart prepaid meters over the next four years to the current installed base of 0.27 crore. This will be a mammoth exercise for discoms both financially and operationally. Discoms will need to spend INR 1.5 lakh crore on smart meter deployment with 15 per cent results-linked support from the Centre. Integrating prepaid meters with the existing system will require discoms to find ways to recover past arrears overhaul billing and IT architecture and upgrade staff capacity. Besides there is scarce evidence that smart or prepaid meters can reduce losses without strict action against electricity theft and non-payments.We propose the following measures to strengthen the RDS scheme taking into account structural challenges long-pending legacy issues and lessons from the past.First address states’ concerns about insufficient resources.States are required to shoulder two-thirds of the expenses needed (more than INR 2 lakh crore) to carry out activities prescribed under the RDS scheme. The status quo on financial position will not change unless the Centre provides them with transitional support in the form of low-cost conditional loans. Taking steps to reduce the cost of power could also create fiscal space for states burdened with power subsidies. For example the Centre could help states prioritise power dispatch from more efficient (and less-polluting) thermal power plants. This could yield annual savings of INR 7500 crore according to a recent study by the Council on Energy Environment and Water ( CEEW ).Second handhold states during scheme implementation. In a bid to secure a higher share of central funding discoms often announce ambitious targets without putting together effective plans to achieve them. Under the scheme discoms have to submit their detailed project reports by the end of the year. So it is critical for central and state-level committees and agencies including regulators to work together to scrutinise the feasibility of discoms’ action plans and project reports. Third adopt a systemic deployment strategy for smart metering infrastructure. Several think tanks have pointed out the need for a standardised methodology to validate claims of efficiency gains from smart meters and track benefits. Discoms should base their phase-wise deployment plans on such an exercise. They should also build internal capacity and overhaul their billing and IT systems. A comprehensive consumer engagement and grievance redressal strategy will also be critical to building social acceptance for this technological transition.For public discoms to retain credibility as power suppliers they must act quickly to fix their finances. Adopting the measures outlined above can pay dividends in the short to medium term. Growing discom losses will likely compel states to prioritise reform over considerations of political economy equally matched with central support. Concerted efforts are required to steer the power sector into a new era of financial sustainability and operational efficiency.",,,,,,,,,

AMERICAN EXPRESS CRT TRAINING URGED STAFF TO ADOPT A HIERARCHY PUTTING ‘MARGINALIZED’ ABOVE ‘PRIVILEGED’

In February a whistleblower at Coca-Cola claimed that the company forced employees to take a seminar teaching them to ""be less white."" The whistleblower posted photos of a seminar giving tips to ""be less white"" including ""be less arrogant be less certain be less defensive be more humble listen believe break with apathy"" and ""break with white solidarity."" The materials claimed that White people in the United States and other western nations are ""socialized to feel that they are inherently superior because they are white.""

Yet Coca-Cola told Fox Business that the slides ""are not part of the company's learning curriculum.""

Coca-Cola President Alfredo Rivera apologized for the situation in March.

""Recently we learned that content accessible through our company training platform did not align with"" being ""respectful for all"" he said.

While this material was not part of the training curriculum Rivera said ""We apologize to those who were offended by this content. We would never encourage anyone to be any less of themselves.""

In March Manhattan Institute Senior Fellow Chris Rufo revealed whistleblower documents from the Walt Disney Company's diversity and inclusion program ""Reimagine Tomorrow."" The program includes multiple training modules on ""antiracism.""

The modules tell employees that they must ""take ownership of educating [themselves] about structural anti-Black racism."" The modules claim that the U.S. has a ""long history of systemic racism and transphobia"" and that White employees must ""work through feelings of guilt shame and defensiveness to understand what is beneath them and what needs to be healed."" Another module encourages employees to reject ""equality"" focusing on ""equal treatment and access to opportunities"" and instead strive for ""equity"" focusing on ""the equality of outcome.""

PFIZER SETS RACE-BASED HIRING GOALS IN THE NAME OF FIGHTING ‘SYSTEMIC RACISM’ ‘GENDER EQUITY CHALLENGES’

Disney did not deny the training but insisted that whistleblowers took it out of context.

Ticker Security Last Change Change % DIS THE WALT DISNEY CO. 105.80 +0.02 +0.02%

""These internal documents are being deliberately distorted as reflective of company policy when in fact their purpose was to allow diversity of thought and discussion on the incredibly complex and challenging issues of race and discrimination that we as a society and companies nationwide are facing"" the company said in a statement.

In August Rufo published internal documents showing that American Express subjected its employees to a series of critical race theory training sessions that encouraged staff to rank themselves on a hierarchy of ""privilege"" and apply that hierarchy in the workplace with the more ""privileged"" employees deferring to staff from ""marginalized groups.""

In the trainings the outside consulting firm Paradigm urged Amex employees to construct their own intersectional identities mapping their ""race sexual orientation body type religion disability status age gender identity [and] citizenship"" on an official company worksheet. Employees could then determine whether they have ""privilege"" or are members of a ""marginalized group."" Whites males heterosexual people Christians able-bodied people and citizens would presumably count as ""privileged.""

The training sessions also warned White employees to avoid certain phrases such as ""I don't see color"" ""We are all human beings"" and ""Everyone can succeed in this society if they work hard enough"" as ""microaggressions.""

In a high-profile ""anti-racism"" event Amex executives invited Khalil Muhammad a great-grandson of Nation of Islam founder Elijah Muhammad to speak on ""race in corporate America."" He argued that capitalism was founded on racism and that ""racist logics and forms of domination"" have shaped Western society since at least the Industrial Revolution. He even argued that the credit card company should reduce standards for Black customers and sacrifice profits in the interest of race-based reparations.

""If American Express cares about racial justice in the world it can’t simply say the market’s going to define how we price certain customers who happen to come from low-income communities"" he said. ""If you want to do good then you’re going to have to set up products and [product] lines that don’t maximize profit.""

AMERICAN EXPRESS ENGAGES IN ‘REVERSE DISCRIMINATION’ AGAINST WHITE PEOPLE CURRENT AND FORMER EMPLOYEES SAY

In September five current and former AmEx employees — speaking on condition of anonymity — told FOX Business that the company singles out Black people for promotion in a practice that former employees described as reverse discrimination against White people. The employees did not present internal documents to demonstrate an official policy but they said they witnessed a worrisome trend that raises questions about racial discrimination in promotion. One former employee said they quit because the critical race theory trainings and the apparent promotion of employees due to skin color sent the message that White employees could not expect to even be considered for promotion.

American Express denied this accusation in a statement.

""We have a high-achieving culture and we are proud of our dedicated and highly engaged colleagues"" an American Express spokesperson told FOX Business. ""Advancement within our company is based solely on individual business and leadership performance. Any characterization of our company and culture to the contrary is just plain wrong.""

The statement also claimed that the company's ""diversity equity and inclusion programs"" focus on upholding a commitment to ""a diverse and inclusive culture where all colleagues feel welcome and heard and have equal opportunities to thrive regardless of their gender race ethnicity age religion sexual orientation and nationality."" The programs ""are not based on any specific theory nor are they directed to a specific group of employees.""

In August Rufo revealed documents showing that Bank of America Lowe's and Truist Financial Corporation sponsored a United Way critical race theory ""Racial Equity 21-Day Challenge"" claiming that America is systemically and institutionally racist encouraging participants to ""decolonize"" their minds and get ""woke at work"" and urging white people to ""cede power to people of color.""

The Racial Equity 21-Day Challenge included a document with responses to potential objections. Should participants ask about reverse discrimination the guide claims that there is no such thing. The document also claims that people of color cannot be racist: ""Racism is used to justify the position of the dominant group White people in this case and to uphold White supremacy and superiority. Everyone can be biased and engage in bigoted and belittling behavior that is intolerant of other perspectives. But racism is by definition a form of oppression exercised by the dominant racial group (Whites).""

BANK OF AMERICA LOWE'S SPONSORED CRT TRAINING URGING WHITES TO ‘CEDE POWER TO PEOPLE OF COLOR’

Bank of America spokesman Bill Haldin told FOX Business that his company does not endorse these ideas and that it does not run its own employee trainings along these lines.

""This was not our program and not our training materials"" he said. ""The United Way ran this program independent of Bank of America and it is not part of our training material.""

Lowe's and Truist Financial did not respond to FOX Business' request for comment.

The pharmaceutical company Pfizer has set goals to fill a percentage of leadership positions with Black and Hispanic candidates by the year 2025 in the name of fighting ""systemic racism."" In September FOX Business reported on an Environmental Social & Governance (ESG) Report 2020  published in March 2021 in which Pfizer set ""opportunity parity goals"" for 2025. Those goals include ""increasing our minority representation from 19% to 32% and doubling the underrepresented population of African Americans/Blacks and Hispanics/Latinos.""

The report includes a letter from Albert Bourla Pfizer's chairman and CEO in which Bourla says he is ""proud"" of having ""set concrete goals to address systemic racism and gender equity challenges by reviewing and augmenting our plans to increase diversity and opportunity parity by 2025 particularly focusing on increasing female and U.S. minority representation at leadership levels.""

""We now have quotas basically in hiring and promotions"" explained a current Pfizer employee who spoke with FOX Business on condition of anonymity. The employee said the company hosted events with Ibram X. Kendi and encouraged employees to read books written by Robin DiAngelo two prominent CRT proponents.

Now you can listen to your favourite newsletter. So have you seen Die Hard? Not the second fourth or the 10th sequel but the original 1988 release that turned Bruce Willis a TV actor into a Hollywood superstar. When it was first released the movie wasn’t expected to become the success it eventually did. It’s now considered one of the greatest action films of all time. When I first saw the movie on the Star Movies channel sometime in the 1990s other than its adrenaline-inducing action and a David beating a Goliath storyline what I loved the most was the song Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!

Hello there! To advertise in this newsletter hit us up at newsletters@livemint.com

For many years until I moved to live first in Hyderabad and then in Mumbai two cities that do not have a winter season I associated very cold days with this song. It’s only the rise of Wikipedia which told me that the song was written in July 1945 by lyricist Sammy Cahn and the composer Jule Styne in Hollywood during the middle of a heatwave when the composers imagined cooler conditions. Of course over the years the song has become one of the most famous Christmas songs due to its winter theme and whenever I listen to it in my mind I can see Santa Claus in his bright red suit coming in on his sleigh with gifts. The thing is Santa didn’t always wear a red suit. Sheena Iyengar a professor at the Columbia Business School in New York tells the story in her wonderful book The Art of Choosing. As she writes: “﻿When you think of Santa Claus what do you imagine? Chances are you see a jolly fat man wearing a bright red suit and cap black boots and belt and a generous smile on his rosy face. This image of Santa Claus was created by Swedish illustrator Haddon Sundblom who was commissioned by the Coca-Cola Company to draw advertisements of St. Nick delivering Cokes to the thirsty children of the world.” Before Coca-Cola did what it did Santa’s suit had different colours. Iyengar quotes Mark Pendergrast’s For God Country and Coca-Cola as saying: “Prior to the Sundblom illustrations the Christmas saint had been variously illustrated wearing blue yellow green or red.” In an interview I did with her many years back for a newspaper that has since shut down she told me: “Ever notice that Santa’s suit is the exact same red as the label for Coke? That’s not a coincidence: the Coca-Cola Company holds a patent on the colour.” Aside from spreading love and cheer Santa Claus also brings gifts for little children. While I am no Santa and you dear readers clearly aren’t children today is Christmas eve and I thought instead of serving up yet another read on the economy and boring you and myself to death let me share a few things that I read watched heard and enjoyed through this year. It’s a season for making year-end lists so here’s mine.

Best crime fiction of the year People who follow me on social media know that I am a big crime fiction junkie. Sometimes I tell myself that I will never hold a full-time job again with the only exception being if someone pays me a salary for reading and reviewing crime fiction. That is my level of obsession with the genre. That apart while I haven’t kept track of the number of crime fiction books I read this year but given that I usually read at least one a week the number must be more than 50. Of those I think these are books that I loved the most. They are in no particular order. 1) Razorblade Tears by SA Cosby: This is a story about two fathers with a rather dodgy past trying to avenge the murder of their sons who were a couple—sounds like a 1970s Hindi masala movie with a 21st-century twist. Though the plot might sound banal the writing is simply sublime. 2) 56 Days by Catherine Ryan Howard: Set in Dublin this is the story of a couple who start living in during the early days of the covid pandemic and nothing is what it seems like. If you are the kind who loves a good twist at the end of the book then this is the book for you. You will spend years before you come across a better twist. 3) Turf Wars by Olivier Norek: Originally written in French by a former policeman this is the story of France and the issues it is battling today of course told in a very entertaining manner with suspense that even the most passionate crime fiction enthusiasts won’t be able to figure out until the writer reveals it. 4) The Dark Hours by Michael Connelly: Writers like Connelly who have turned out good book after good book for years should essentially be banned from being a part of any list so that others also get a chance. Nonetheless for someone who only writes good books and better books The Dark Hours is Connelly’s best book in many years. But of course he is the master of the police procedural; no one can beat him at it. 5) The Dark Remains by William McIlvanney and Ian Rankin: Mcllvanney the father of modern Scottish crime fiction died in 2015. A few years later his widow going through his belongings found an incomplete script. Ian Rankin reading whose books have given me more pleasure over the years than possibly any other writer completed it. Set in Glasgow in the early 1970s this book was music to my ears. It has everything that I love in a crime novel a disturbed slightly off the hook detective whose family life is going to the dogs a murder which no one can seem to solve a setting where it rains all the time and some good suspense. 6) The Appeal by Janice Hallett: The most innovative crime novel I read this year where the whole novel is written in the form of emails. Of course at its heart the book follows the quintessential Agatha Christie formula of a murder within a small group but the setting is very 21st century. 7) Who is Maud Dixon by Alexandra Andrews and The Plot by Jean Hanff Korelitz: Two books about writers stealing in the first the identity of another writer and in the second the basic plot of a book written by a writer who has died. Both delightful reads. 8) Billy Summers by Stephen King: A hired killer is out for his last kill after which he plans to take the money and retire. As a part of his elaborate plan he is even pretending to write a book. The trouble is that life has other plans everything unravels until it comes back together again sort of. 9) Suburban Dicks by Fabian Nicieza: A pregnant woman with four children who once happened to be a budding FBI profiler ends up at a murder scene. She can’t give up on what she has seen and starts to investigate the murder along with a local journalist whose best days are behind him. The last scene of the book is an absolute killer.

Best OTT crime series of the year Given the amount of crime fiction I read I rarely watch any OTT series. I saw two crime OTT series this year. The first one was Bosch. Bosch is a character created by Michael Connelly (whose latest book I mentioned earlier) and brought life on the screen by the actor Titus Welliver. Bosch believes that “everybody matters or nobody matters” which is why the series has a very strong moral undertone. Having read the Bosch books over the years it is simply fascinating to see it on screen. This season ends with a Creedence Clearwater Revival song Long As I Can See The Light which lifts the whole season a notch above the earlier ones. The other crime series I loved was the Danish series Chestnut Man. It is based on the book of the same name by Søren Sveistrup. Having read the book a few years back I knew the storyline but it was still terrific to see the dark crime thriller being brought out so well on the screen. Given that Sveistrup was one of the writers of the series that must have helped. Of course I have been a long-term sucker of Scandinavian crime fiction. So give me anything dark which has long-shots of the countryside and very little background music I am likely to love it. Chestnut Man has all three. Highly recommended but definitely not for the weak-hearted. The third OTT series that I sort of saw almost every day while having lunch or dinner was Jerry Seinfeld’s Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee which has nothing to do with crime fiction. The brilliance of Seinfeld and his guests was just at another level. Also I love stuff that ends in less than 19 minutes and I don’t have to break my head watching it for the next 22 seasons simply because it reminds me of the never-ending soap opera The Bold and the Beautiful. (Of course Bosch is an exception to this rule).

The music I enjoyed the most this year In my years of growing up in a public sector colony one of our neighbours a Punjabi widower had a great fascination for old Punjabi singers and their songs. And that’s where as a teenager I discovered the legendary Punjabi singer Surinder Kaur and her beautiful song Lathe di chadar uthe saleti rang mahiya. While there is a widely more popular Coke Studio version of the song now in these days of auto-tuned voices nothing absolutely nothing beats Kaur’s original. So in 2021 I rediscovered this and other songs by Surinder Kaur. Another Surinder Kaur song I love is Mainu heere heere akhe written by the legendary Punjabi poet Shiv Kumar Batalvi who unfortunately died very young. Of course this year my love for modern Punjabi music went up even further and my Punjabi playlist now has close to 70 songs. This year I also happened to discover the playback singer Rajkumari and her song Ek teer challa by from the 1949 film Mahal. The song was set to tune by Khemchand Prakash and written by J Nakshab and is filled with the kind of pathos I have never heard before. Ironically the same movie had a young singer who was probably still in her teens when she sang a song called Aayega aayega aane waala for the movie. A song that set the singer for decades of superstardom which no one has achieved when it comes to playback singing in Hindi cinema. The one and only Lata Mangeshkar. In the time I have spent all alone during the covid pandemic I discovered the Canadian singer Gordon Lightfoot. And I have tremendously loved listening to his music and in particular the song Did she mention my name. I discovered two other singers through this year and loved their music. One is Jim Coerce and his song Thursday. The other is Harry Chapin and his wonderful song on how numbing education can be—Flowers are red. I came to know of this song in an episode of Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee where Sarah Jessica Parker who most famously played Carrie Bradshaw in Sex and the City was Seinfeld’s guest. In this episode Parker tells Seinfeld that she was a background singer on Chapin’s song Flowers are red when she was a kid. After Parker says this both she and Seinfeld start singing the song. In the conversation Seinfeld mentions that Chapin had died young of a heart attack on the very highway they were driving at that time. Of course like every year I blasted three of my favourite rock songs whenever I could. Bon Jovi’s In These Arms Guns N’ Roses’ November Rain and finally Anjan Dutt’s Bela Bose with Kolkata’s most famous phone number 2441139. And there was also Kabir Suman’s classic Tomake Chai. There are two kinds of people in this world those who understand Tomake chai and those who don’t. And if you don’t it’s time you did.

The newsletter I loved writing the most Of all the Easynomics newsletters I wrote this year the one I loved writing the most was published on October 8 and it was titled The Story of Life—Or Why People Go Mad in Herds. It proved once again that the best pieces are not written but they simply write themselves. The other piece I enjoyed writing was a 2000 word long-story I wrote for the Mint. It was titled India’s Unending Agony Over Coal. I enjoyed writing this for the simple reason that I never thought I would start a 2000 word piece in a business daily with a song from Gangs of Wasseypur and the editors would let it go. They did. Bairi coal coal coal.

Best non-fiction books of the year To know the non-fiction books that I liked reading in 2021 you will have to wait a little more. A list of the books will be published in the Mint early next week. But let me give one recommendation here as well. The Number Bias – How Numbers Lead and Mislead Us by Sanne Blauw: I love reading books on how Maths is used in popular culture especially in the media. This book was originally written in Dutch and has been translated into English. So while the examples are largely from the Western world the lessons are universal.

The non-fiction book I will be reading as the year ends In each of the years since 2013 I have had an original book a translation a reissue or audiobooks published. 2021 was the first year where nothing came out. So someone said I needed a holiday suggesting that I was getting lazy tired and jaded. I think more than that I am bored writing about the same things over and over again. Repeating the right thing at the right time is a very important part of being in the media because issues largely don’t change; only the noise around them does. Anyway I am thinking of taking a break from reading non-fiction at least in the week through the New Year. I can’t take a break from writing non-fiction simply because my forefathers gave me the education and the upbringing necessary to make a living but they never earned much. And that apart there needs to be some variety in life. I plan to read American crime fiction writer Lawrence J Block’s Telling Lies For Fun and Profit – A Manual for Fiction Writers. My next book whenever it comes out in this decade will definitely have a few murders a disturbed detective whose family life is going all wrong rainy weather and hopefully suspense that leaves everyone surprised. It’s time to kill a few people fictionally and in the process become what I have been reading over the years. Life as they say is stranger than fiction. And why should I be left out of that? PS: Here is wishing everyone a Happy New Year. Also get vaccinated (if you haven’t already) and stay masked! PS 1: I wanted to say this somewhere but couldn’t fit it in so here it is at the very end. My moment of the year was Washington Sundar India’s fifth choice bowling all-rounder (or was it sixth) who hadn’t played a first-class match in years hitting Pat Cummins one of the best fast bowlers in the world for a six at the Gabba in his debut test match. Nothing from the sport where 22 men in shorts run around chasing a ball and the game ends even before Cheteshwar Pujara can say Jack Robinson can possibly come close.

I mean what else did we expect? It’s ”THE” COCA-COLA! — and yes there is a lot to unpack so grab your juice box or whatever feels like a comfort zone to you and enjoy.

First off the invite-only event took place on Monday November 22 2021 at Eko Hotel Lagos Nigeria and was well attended by the crème de la crème of the Nigerian media the Coca-Cola System leadership and key stakeholders and partners across the country. Shameless name drops will be the Vice President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria Professor Yemi Osinbajo and the Deputy Governor of Lagos State Dr. Obafemi Hamzat — like I said it’s COCA-COLA!

The event opened to a lounge area that had mouth-watering finger foods fabulously dressed guests chatting excitedly away an all-you-can-drink bar with – I promise you – the most delicious cocktails you’ve ever tasted. The final boss of this section was a Coca-Cola System museum wing that had artefacts on display and a history wall that tracked the beverage company’s achievements for the last 70 years.

As the celebrations progressed there was not one but TWO exhilarating performances from the thespians at Terra Kulture and all these happened while we stuffed our faces with delectable meals. It was not all play however as The Coca-Cola System which comprises Coca-Cola Nigeria and its bottling partner Nigerian Bottling Company took some time to celebrate 70 iconic Nigerians who have been pivotal to the company’s business in Nigeria.

The highlight of the evening was the Vice President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria Professor Yemi Osinbajo’s witty and encouraging speech. He spoke on how between 1975 to 2017 he probably drank 29200 bottles of Coca-Cola. He also congratulated the Board and Management of The Coca-Cola Company on the iconic anniversary celebration and saluted the System’s hard work and dedication to thriving and maintaining its leadership position in the market.

He feels it tastes it and smells it because how could he not?

He admitted as much the other day when he was asked whether he has come to fully grasp the utter disdain Buffalo Bills fans have for the New England Patriots.

“Yeah we understand” Allen said flatly. “For how long this team’s been kind of the top dog in this division and really the conference … we players we know that we feel that but we try to set that aside as much as possible and focus in and hone in on executing a game plan.”

Coach Sean McDermott also gets the vitriol Bills Mafia spews in the direction of the Evil Empire and if any of his players especially the newer ones don’t get it he has made them cognizant.

This isn’t Christmas week. This is beat the Patriots week.

“I think awareness is No. 1 as to how our fans are during New England week” he said. “I think the guys shouldn’t lack for much motivation at this point. This is what you work all offseason for and all season. You want to continue to improve your play every week.”

This is no ordinary game taking place Sunday afternoon at Gillette Stadium long known as a House of Horrors for the Bills. In all likelihood the winner will ultimately capture the AFC East division title a crown the Patriots arrogantly wore almost continuously for two decades but one they relinquished to Buffalo in 2020.

A Bills victory pulls them even with the Patriots at 9-6 and what that means is this: If they go on to win their last two games at home against the Falcons and Jets they win the division regardless of what New England does.

A loss coupled with a loss by Miami to New Orleans on Monday clinches the division title for the Patriots and thrusts Buffalo into the free-for-all that is the wild-card hunt.

The math and the path is simple the task will be anything but.

Here are the keys to the game:

1. A nice December day should help the Buffalo Bills offense

We all know what happened three weeks ago when Hurricane Highmark blew through Orchard Park and ruined any semblance of a normal football game plus severely handicapped the Bills because as much as it might pain fans to admit their team is not built for bad weather.

The forecast for Sunday looks decent enough for December so let’s see which team is actually better when they can both play to their strengths. For the Bills on offense that’s their passing game with Allen being able to use all areas of the field unimpeded by gale-force winds. However he won't have COVID-19 casualties Cole Beasley and Gabriel Davis which could potentially have a negative impact on the effectiveness of the offense. It looks as if Emmanuel Sanders can return from his knee injury and that would certainly help. If so Sanders Stefon Diggs Isaiah McKenzie and tight end Dawson Knox are going to have to shoulder a heavy burden.

The Patriots do an outstanding job in their pass rush as Bill Belichick confuses even the greatest QBs with his litany of pressure packages. The Bills’ offensive line has struggled most of the year though there was good news Saturday when the Bills activated LT Dion Dawkins off the reserve/COVID-19 list. We don’t know the status of LG Jon Feliciano right now but getting Dawkins back is a huge deal. That means Spencer Brown can move back to RT and Daryl Williams can return to RG and that alignment is much more preferable confronting a stout Patriots front seven that is led by Matthew Judon (12.5 sacks) Kyle Van Noy Ja’Whaun Bentley (team-high 81 tackles) Deatrich Wise Christian Barmore and Lawrence Guy.

And then in the back end big nickel Kyle Dugger (80 tackles four turnovers) who missed the first game is back and that’s a key piece because of all the things he can do in coverage and against the run. J.C. Jackson (seven picks) is one of the best CBs in the league and Devin McCourty is a wily veteran at safety. It will be a huge challenge for Allen to find downfield chunk plays.

One thing the Bills may need to do is rely a little more on their running game to counteract the pressure and prevent the Patriots from sitting back with seven in coverage. Devin Singletary is coming off his best game of the season and the Patriots have been somewhat susceptible on the ground.

They have allowed 595 yards in the last three games to the Titans (without Derrick Henry) the Bills (99 yards) and the Colts (with Jonathan Taylor). If the Bills can be balanced like they were against a good Carolina defense last week that will give Allen a better chance.

2. Let’s see what New England Patriots QB Mac Jones is made of

The rookie has been outstanding this season which is really not a pleasant development for the Bills or their fans. The Patriots said goodbye to Tom Brady suffered for one measly season with Cam Newton and now seem to have found their next franchise QB. I’m not saying Jones will ever come close to Brady but my sense is he’s going to be pretty good for many years.

However in the first game Jones was asked to literally do nothing but hand off. And because the Patriots owned the line of scrimmage they shredded the Bills for 222 yards and controlled the game with the three-headed RB monster of Damien Harris Rhamondre Stevenson and Brandon Bolden.

This time the Bills will be geared up for the run and Jones is going to have to prove he can make things happen against a good Buffalo defense. And he'll have to do it without Stevenson who has already been ruled out with an illness and Harris is battling a hamstring injury which sidelined him last week. Without Harris the Patriots rushed for only 81 yards though some of that was due to falling behind early in their loss to the Colts and having to play catch up all night.

Wide receiver Jakobi Meyers has been a pleasant surprise for the Patriots with a team-high 65 receptions but they have produced just 664 yards mainly because offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels tries to call concepts where Jones can make a quick read and deliver and that results in plenty of short throws. What will be interesting is to see if the Bills play less nickel with Taron Johnson on the field and use linebacker A.J. Klein to help thwart the run game. Klein missed the first game because of COVID.

The guy to watch for New England is Hunter Henry who leads all tight ends with nine TDs. Since Week 4 he has been targeted on 42% of his routes in the red zone the highest rate in the NFL which explains his TD total. It’s not that Henry is a great athlete like KC’s Travis Kelce and consistently beats coverage it’s that the Patriots scheme ways to get him open and his physicality gives him an advantage on contested throws.

3. Other key points in Buffalo Bills vs. New England Patriots matchup

► In the last meeting the Patriots snapped Buffalo’s nine-game AFC East winning streak which dated to the start of 2020.

► Last week Allen went past 30 TD passes for the season making him the first Bills QB in their history to have back-to-back seasons with at least 30.

► With his 82 catches for 1007 yards so far this season Stefon Diggs is the first player in franchise history with over 80 receptions and 1000 yards in consecutive seasons.

► The Buffalo pass defense has allowed a league-low 11 passing TDs this season. And since 2017 the Bills have yielded just 203.4 passing

yards per game and 85 total passing TDs which both lead the league.

► New England is one of four teams along with Arizona Cincinnati and Dallas that enter Week 16 with division leads after missing the playoffs in 2020. In 17 of the past 18 seasons at least two teams have won their divisions the season after missing the playoffs.

► Each team ranks among league leaders in both turnover ratio and takeaways. New England is fifth with a plus-9 ratio and tied for third with the Bills with 27 takeaways. Buffalo ranks sixth with plus-8 ratio.

► In terms of points against the Patriots are No. 1 (16.2 per game) the Bills are tied for second (17.4) and in yards the Bills are No. 1 (287.9) and the Patriots are third (307.5).

► Jones leads all rookies in passer rating (94.6) passing yards (3168) and TD passes (18).

► The Patriots will be looking for their 16th season sweep of the Bills since Belichick took over in 2000 and their 28th overall dating back to 1960.

Sal’s prediction: Buffalo Bills 20 New England Patriots 17

I don’t know what has gotten into me. Picking the Bills to beat the Patriots just seems dangerous because there is so much scar tissue built up over the past two decades. But my thought is that this is going to be a properly focused and prepared Buffalo team Sunday one that will be looking to make amends for what happened in Orchard Park three weeks earlier a game the Bills had multiple chances to win and didn’t.

Assuming the weather is reasonable the Bills’ full playbook should be available and even with a depleted receiving corps Allen should be able to move the ball against the Patriots. The key will come on the other side and whether the Bills can contain New England’s running game and force Jones to beat them with his own potentially limited receiving corps. I’ll take Allen over Jones.

Talking points

► Patriots coach Bill Belichick on the development of Josh Allen: “I think we talked about this the last time about how much he’s improved. That’s borne out in the numbers and watching him play as well. Percentage of completions production and so forth. He’s really hard to stop. He does a good job at everything. He’s continued to grow as a player and I think you see his leadership his toughness his physical ability all that on a very consistent basis. He’s the guy that makes them go and he’s become one of the top quarterbacks in the league.”

► Patriots QB Mac Jones on putting the Colts loss behind him: “I think you just have to keep moving forward and understand what we’re about to face in a really good football team. It comes down to controlling what you can control and that’s your attitude and your effort. We’re trying to do that every day and eventually we’ll stack days together and we’ll get a chance to play like I said against a really good team who have a lot of talented players but they’re also really well-coached.”

► Patriots FS Devin McCourty on the rivalry with the Bills: “It’s going to be a battle and I think they were the top dogs last year we had a heated game (a few weeks ago). I truly believe in my 12 years in the league when you play a divisional opponent they don’t like you they want to win. I don’t care if their season is going to be over next week and they’re not gonna make the playoffs or they’re the number one seed in the AFC. It doesn’t matter you don’t want to lose to your division opponents. I think it’s no different in this game.”

So they filled it,"When he made the switch from public to private school Austin Ma noticed a striking difference: his new school was offering far more computer science courses a gap in education he found ""unsettling.""

""I got to enjoy all these new really fun coding courses but cognizant that they were unavailable to other kids who shared similar interests to learn.""

As the COVID-19 pandemic triggered lockdowns in March 2020 Ma was looking for something to fill his spare time. Along with his friend Kevin Guo he launched Coding Pals Foundation a non-profit service that offers coding education to students who would otherwise be without that opportunity.

High school students with coding skills volunteer their time to teach other students online primarily in B.C. but also in other cities in Canada.

Without having basic coding knowledge Ma said it's impossible for youth to know whether or not they want to pursue computer science in post-secondary.

""The main goal is to kind of combat vast educational disparities within the B.C. schooling system"" he said adding that coding skills are becoming increasingly important.

""I think we're in a world where technology is really really taking over. And I guess coding I feel like it's just a really really important skill that is just not really democratized and made available to everyone.""

Through word-of-mouth and sharing their program on social media Ma and Guo were able to gather 100 students for their first class in 2020.

Since then 25 instructors have joined the team and more than 1400 students have registered with the program.

""We've received an extremely positive response from our community and many students and parents have reached out to tell us about how much they enjoyed our classes and that they learned a lot from them"" Guo said.

One of the students who signed up was eight-year-old Natalie Liu who is in Grade 3 at Renfrew Elementary School in Vancouver.

She said she was introduced to coding in first grade when she started playing computer games and now she can learn to create her own games.

""It's fun to code"" she said. ""It really excites me to make games.""

Natalie said her instructors have been patient with her as she learns the basics.

Her mom Tammy Tan said she appreciates that the classes are free which gives her daughter a chance to try something new with no risk.

She said she has four kids and it wouldn't necessarily be affordable if they all wanted to take coding classes.

Austin Ma says knowing how to code is becoming increasingly important for young people but access to that education is lacking. (Heather Gillis/CBC)

Anthony He a Grade 9 student from St. Patrick Regional Secondary has also been taking classes through the Coding Pals Foundation.

""I like to create things when it comes to computers. I also like to create YouTube videos. I edit a lot. I thought coding would be pretty useful for that"" he said.

His mom Chris Gui said the fact the classes were taught by her son's peers made it less traditional and more fun.

""I feel like Anthony was more engaged and involved in the class"" Gui said.

Ma and Guo hope to create more formal partnerships with elementary and middle schools in Vancouver to help get more young people coding.

Eventually they want to do the same with schools across Canada.

Coding Pals Foundation has brought in sponsors including a Waterloo Ont. based software company called Maplesoft to help with operating costs. They've also received funding through grants and fundraising efforts.

Now a senior at St. George's School in Vancouver Ma said he's considering a career in education once he finishes high school next spring.

He plans to continue teaching a few courses and training younger students to oversee the day-to-day operations of the foundation while he stays involved with larger decisions by sitting on the organization's board.",,,,,,

In this round-up piece CosmeticsDesign-Europe looks back at our coverage on patents filed in 2021 and highlights some key areas industry is investing time and science in.

The future of ‘smart’ at-home beauty devices​

Beauty tech continued to advance fast in 2021 with many of the major brands investing plenty of research time and money in this space. An exciting field full of breakthrough consumer-led innovations personalisation and efficacy were undoubtedly driving this category.

. P&G ​Just this month Procter & Gamble (P&G) filed an international patent for a hair grooming device​ it had developed to analyse the time speed and force of a user brushing – collecting and storing data to communicate and guide consumers on personalised hair care needs.

. Beiersdorf ​In October Beiersdorf filed an international patent detailing an AI-driven method​ it had developed to profile skin based on moisture levels and geographical location. Via a mobile phone it provided an accurate picture of a consumer’s overall skin condition and enabled personalised product recommendations to be made by the brand according to real-time and evolving needs.

. L’Oréal ​In July L’Oréal filed its own international patent on a digital skin diagnosis system​ that analysed protein biomarkers to predict trends likely to be experienced by a consumer because of these also enabling customised formulations to be made along with more suitable product recommendations.

In February L’Oréal also filed an international patent on a smart skin treatment device​ that responded to voice cues from consumers and provided audio guidance during treatments to optimise the user experience. The device offered a range of cleansing and massaging options.

. Estée Lauder ​With more of a focus on efficacy in August Estée Lauder filed two international patents for two separate functional devices​ – one made with a reusable pump that simultaneously cooled and dispensed product and another single-use cosmetic pad with a self-heating function and preloaded formulation. Both inventions it said improved shelf-life and product efficacy for consumers at home.

. Unilever ​In May Unilever also filed an international patent for a user-friendly teeth whitening kit​ that combined a film and light source to improve efficacy. The kit it said also simplified the process for consumers.

Next-generation active formulas with CBD and naturals ​

There was also a continued focus on active beauty innovation using upcoming alternative natural ingredients in skin care hair care and oral care. The goal? To take beauty up a level and offer consumers more benefits beyond aesthetics.

. Colgate-Palmolive ​In April Colgate-Palmolive filed three international patents on CBD oral care blends​ that integrated a cannabinoid – cannabidiol (CBD) – for antibacterial efficacy and anti-inflammatory action. The blends it said could be used to make a range of oral care products including toothpaste mouthwash oral gels mouth spray and even chewing gum.

The personal care major also filed an international patent on a CBD antiperspirant blend​ it said offered anti-irritant properties for the skin.

. Unilever ​In November Unilever also filed an international patent on a metal-free antiperspirant blend​ made without traditional metal-based actives like aluminium instead using film forming polymers solvents and plasticizers as an alternative. The blend it said could be used to make stick or gel roll-on antiperspirant products.

Earlier that year in March Unilever also filed a patent for a zinc salt toothpaste​ that it said lowered blood pressure via enhanced nitrate reductase activity. The company said findings had been backed by a six-week clinical study.

. L’Oréal ​In September L’Oréal filed an international patent for curly hair styling formula​ made using sugar compounds and plant fibres offering a natural and light-weight alternative to polymer and silicone products that it said were often sticky on application and dried stiff. The formulation it said offered durable styling shaping benefits curl definition improved shine and frizz control.

. Beiersdorf ​In January Beiersdorf filed three international patents on a collection of alternative UV filter blends​ it had developed for use in cosmetic applications and sunscreens that addressed stability and nano particle concerns. The blends it said could be used in a range of formulas including ointments creams low-viscosity lotions sprays and even integrated into plasters or cloths as an impregnation medium.

Circular sustainable and beautiful packaging​

Industry also continued to innovate in alternative packaging materials with a focus on circular opportunities in post-consumer waste - a challenging space particularly for premium beauty.

. Unilever ​In August Unilever filed an international patent on a sustainable black coloured packaging​ made from layered post-consumer resin materials that would previously have been treated as waste. The invention it said offered an acceptable colour for premium beauty products – the biggest challenge when using post-consumer materials.

In October the European Patent Office (EPO) released a study​ outlining that cosmetics and detergents were the two categories innovating ""most intensely"" in bioplastic technologies worldwide with Europe and the US leading the charge.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aXBwZXJhcnlsaXZlLmllL25ld3MvaG9tZS83MTEwOTQvdGlwcGVyYXJ5LWZpcm0tZGVudGFxdWEtd2lucy1nbG9iYWwtc3VzdGFpbmFiaWxpdHktYXdhcmQtZm9yLW5ldy1kZW50YWwtcHJvZHVjdC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tipperary firm Dentaqua wins global sustainability award for new dental product,"Tipperary dental technology firm Dentaqua has won a global sustainability award for their leadership innovation and commitment to sustainable business practices.

The Clonmel-based company won the SEAL Sustainable Product Award which honours innovative and impactful products that are literally “purpose-built” for a sustainable future.

Previous SEAL Award winners include Nestle IBM Samsung and Colgate Palmolive.

The award is recognition for Dentaqua’s complete dental disinfection system. Dentaqua replaces traditional chemical disinfectants with a device that produces eco-friendly disinfectants on demand. Dentaqua’s device produces a dental practice’s entire disinfectant needs for use in surface disinfection hand sanitising impression disinfection dental waterline disinfection and more.

The only inputs to the Dentaqua device are water and a trace amount of salt The disinfectant produced is non-toxic yet has a 30 second kill time.

Dentaqua chief operating officer Kevin Keane said the company was very proud to be the first dentistry product to win a SEAL Award for sustainability.

“Our goal is to help dental practices become more sustainable. The average dental practice disposes of 20000 single-use wipes annually – that’s two billion wipes disposed of every year by the industry. Dentaqua eliminates the use of single-use wipes and disinfectant packaging. Furthermore by eliminating all harmful chemicals the practice is a safer place for staff and patients” he said.

SEAL Awards founder Matt Harney said increased corporate prioritisation of ESG (Environmental Social and Governance) initiatives has been a welcome and needed change as our climate crisis further accelerates.

“This increased investment in sustainable business practices has raised the bar for ESG excellence making this our most competitive award event ever with a record number of submissions. Our mission at SEAL is to rigorously assess and then celebrate extraordinary sustainability leadership.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vZmVtaW5pc21pbmluZGlhLmNvbS8yMDIxLzEyLzI0L2luZGlhbi13b21lbi1pbi1zdGVtLTIwMjEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,8 Women In STEM Who Made A Mark In 2021,"Dear reader this article is free to read and it will remain free – but it isn’t free to produce. If you want to support the work that goes behind publishing high-quality feminist media content please consider becoming a FII member. Thank you!

With the start of the pandemic in 2020 there has been a tectonic shift of focus towards healthcare and an emphasis on scientific reasoning more than ever. With the rise of socio-political movements globally there has been an intersectional and often an empathetic approach towards these fields of science and technology and medicine which inevitably highlights the importance of the contributions of women and other marginalised sections to these arenas. It remains to be noted that women and other historically oppressed gender class and caste minorities were sidelined and their contributions neglected for the longest time in STEM (Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics) although there were anomalies. From ASHA workers who have always been doing most of the footwork in ensuring the wellbeing of people on ground to women scientists being at the helm of making COVID-19 vaccines the pandemic brought about a shift in the focus towards women’s work in STEM as we know it now.

Closer home in India women in STEM have been making history too. From Neena Gupta the Indian Statistical Institute professor who became the fourth Indian mathematician to receive the prestigious Ramanujan prize to the four IIT Rourkee professors who made it to Confederation of Indian Industry’s list of top women achievers in STEM we as a country are glowing with pride in their achievements in a field traditionally seen as a patriarchal domain.

Here’s What You Need to Remember: The vulnerabilities of the big carriers are real and the U.S. needs to either remedy those problems or consider an alternative means of delivering ordnance.

The United States has decided to spend many billions of dollars on the CVN-78 (“Ford”) class of aircraft carriers to replace the venerable Nimitz class. The latter has served the U.S. Navy since 1975 with the last ship (USS George H. W. Bush) entering service in 2009. The Fords could be in service in one configuration or another until the end of the 21st century.

Just as the U.S. government has determined to make this investment numerous analysts have argued that the increasing lethality of anti-access/area denial systems ( especially China’s but also Russia and Iran) has made the aircraft carrier obsolete. If so investing in a class of ships intended to serve for 90 years might look like a colossal waste of money.

As with any difficult debate we should take time to define our terms and clarify the stakes. The anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) systems around the world may indeed curb the effectiveness of the Ford class but the U.S. will still find uses for this ships.

Define Obsolete:

We need to carefully describe how we think about obsolescence. Military analysts often equates obsolescence with uselessness especially while pursuing dollars for new gadgets but the two words don’t mean the same thing. In every war armies navies and air forces fight with old even archaic equipment. Built for World War II the A-26 Invader attack aircraft served in the Vietnam War. The USS New Jersey  declared obsolete at the end of World War II fought off Korea Vietnam and Lebanon. The A-10 “Warthog” thought by many to be obsolete before it even flew continues to fight in America’s wars. For countries less well-endowed than the United States the point hold even more strongly; all of the armies currently fighting in Syria and Libya use equipment that the U.S. considered obsolete decades ago.

The point is that even if the ships of the CVN-78 class cannot penetrate advanced A2/AD systems they can still serve other useful purposes. Indeed American carriers since 1945 have entirely earned their keep on these other missions which include strike in permissive environments displays of national power and commitment and relief operations. “Obsolescence” for one kind of mission does not imply uselessness across the range of maritime military operations.

Carrier vs. A2/AD:

People have predicted the obsolescence of the aircraft carrier since the end of World War II. The Soviets developed an elaborate system of submarines sensors and aircraft designed to strike US aircraft carriers. The U.S. developed countermeasures including the F-14 Tomcat  intended to defeat and distract the Soviet systems. As war never happened we never had the opportunity to test the capabilities of a carrier air wing against a flight of Tu-22M “Backfire” bombers. The Soviets and the Americans worked hard against each other countering each innovation with an ever-more-sophisticated reply. Each iteration led to a different constellation of power and vulnerability; the bombers had the upper hand at some points and the carriers at others.

The next generation of A2/AD capabilities will have a similarly non-linear character. While Chinese missiles might have the range and terminal maneuverability to find U.S. carriers missile defense and electronic counter-measures might make the missiles ineffective to the point of uselessness . Similar improvements in anti-submarine technology could limit or eliminate the vulnerability that carriers face against undersea threats. Carriers that become “obsolete” may not stay that way.

Flexibility:

The utility of a large flat-decked ship comes primarily from the kinds of aircraft it can carry and launch. The aircraft carrier as a concept has survived in no small part because aircraft carriers are good for jobs other than penetrating tightly defended A2/AD systems. Indeed no U.S. carrier since World War II has ever needed to directly challenge such a system. Instead (as noted above) aircraft carriers have found themselves jobs in a variety of other conditions.

The U.S. Navy has enjoyed the advantage of nearly unfettered access to enemy airspace over the past twenty-five years and has structured its air wings accordingly. While the U.S. has been slower than many would have liked to adapt to the new array of anti-access threats  the development of fifth and sixth generation stealth aircraft as well as the eventual procurement of long range carrier-based strike zones can help restore the usefulness of the CVN-78 class even if anti-access weapons drive the carriers further out to sea.

The Final Salvo:

Plenty of world-beating weapons quickly become obsolete. The fast battleships of World War II went into reserve less than a decade after their commissioning. The early fighters and bombers of the jet age sometimes had even briefer lifespans. Aircraft carriers in widely variant forms have enjoyed a good long run. They survive because aircraft have short ranges and fixed airfields have significant military and political vulnerabilities. These two factors seem likely to persist.

However just because flat-decked aircraft carrying ships will likely be with us does not mean that the Ford class which emphasizes high-intensity high technology warfare represents an ideal investment of U.S. defense capital. The vulnerabilities of the big carriers are real and the U.S. needs to either remedy those problems or consider an alternative means of delivering ordnance.

Costco’s Northern Lights candle recall

The Northern Lights Alaura Two-Tone Jar Candles can “shatter crack or break apart while burning posing laceration and fire hazards.” That’s according to the Costco candle recall announcement posted on the US Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) website last week.

Northern Lights issued the recall but the company distributed the faulty jar candles through Costco stores.

The Alaura Brand Two-Tone Jar Candles come in a decorative glass jar that has a metal lid on top. They were available in two scents: Frosted Forest and Vanilla Biscotti. Both of the scents are included in the recall.

You’ll find “Alaura Candles” printed on a sticker at the bottom of the glass container.

Costco sold nationwide nearly 140000 units of the candles in the recall. The product was available from August 2021 through September 2021 for a retail price of $17.

Northern Lights received 138 reports of candle incidents that led to the Costco recall. The CPSC recall page says the jars can shatter crack or break apart. That’s what happened in these incidents. Out of the 138 reports three included laceration injuries.

What you should do

The following image should help you identify the Northern Lights candles in the Costco recall:

Northern Lights jar candles in Costco recall

If you have the Northern Lights Alaura Brand Two-Tone Jar Candles at home you should stop using them right now. Even if you haven’t experienced any issues as described in the recall announcement you should still pick another candle to burn. The glass jar can break unexpectedly and this can lead to fires and injury from the shattering glass.

Buyers should return the candles in the recall to Costco Warehouse for a full refund. If you’re not able to do that you should contact Northern Lights by email. The company will provide instructions on how to cut the candle wicks. It will then require proof of the procedure. You’ll then be able to dispose of the candles in the recall with Northern Lights processing the full refund. Costco is also contacting known purchasers separately.

You should check out the full recall announcement at this link. It includes more product images of the faulty candles and the contact information you need to obtain your refund.

Those who shop at Costco or similar warehouse stores are likely familiar with having their receipt checked at the door. As Taste of Home points out some shoppers might think this is to catch potential shoplifters but that isn't the only reason.

According to Business Insider one function of the receipt check is to make sure customers have what they paid for — no more no less. Another reason employees check the receipt is to make sure it was printed that day and isn't being used to score some extra goods.

Receipts that pass the checkpoint are marked. At some locations the mark is just a simple line. At other locations receipts get marked with a smiley face such as those drawn by one well-paid TikToker. And still at other locations employees might note a receipt with a thoughtful little sketch. We all appreciate acts of kindness but for children especially these moments make a huge difference — and one mother recently shared so on Reddit.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVhdHRoaXMuY29tL25ld3MtZm9vZHMtZGlzYXBwZWFyZWQtZnJvbS1zdG9yZS1zaGVsdmVzLTIwMjEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,11 Beloved Foods That Disappeared From Store Shelves in 2021,"This year it feels like there were more discontinuations shortages and recalls than ever before which means going through the grocery aisles looked very different from one week to the next. Even some of the most popular pantry staples and household favorites were nowhere to be found.

So if you're not seeing some of the items on your grocery list in the store it could be because they've disappeared from shelves altogether. We've rounded up some of the most beloved foods that vanished from grocery stores in 2021.

Barilla Bucatini Pasta

We don't know many people who don't have pasta in their pantry—and Barilla is one of the most popular brands. And since COVID-19 fewer people are going out to restaurants and instead they're staying in—and apparently making pasta. Earlier this year Barilla acknowledged that their bucatini pasta a long pasta with a hole in the middle was in short supply due to production delays. The company explained that their pasta will eventually make its way back on grocery store shelves but there is no timeline yet.

Paper Towels

This is a shortage we've been hearing about since the start of the pandemic but it didn't fade quickly. In August Costco announced that they reinstated a purchase limit of one unit per member on their Kirkland Signature Paper Towels. So if you thought you could run to the store to stock up before it's too late you may need to think again.

And apparently Costco isn't the only store limiting this paper product. According to Facebook users many other local grocers are putting similar one or two-unit limits on their paper towels as well.

Maple Syrup

Before you start whipping up your next batch of pancakes or waffles you should know that a bottle of maple syrup might be tough to come by. According to Bloomberg this year maple syrup production was down by 24% compared to last year in the biggest maple syrup region. This means that the Quebec Maple Syrup Producers had to dip into their stockpile of syrup to try to stock the shelves in Canada but thankfully in the United States there is less of an issue.

According to the Vermont Maple Sugar Makers' Association they are having no problem getting maple syrup to grocery stores in the U.S. So as long as your supermarket keeps the shelves fully stocked with their inventory you shouldn't have too much trouble picking up a bottle despite the tough year for the production teams.

Lunchables

When most schools are back in session in person this fall after all of that remote learning parents were looking for those easy packed lunches once again. And one option that's been popular for decades now is Lunchables. But Kraft likely wasn't expecting the demand to increase so quickly which led to fewer Lunchables on grocery store shelves and a challenge to keep them stocked. So don't be surprised if the Lunchables shelf is left bare the next time you head to the grocery store to stock up.

Kirkland Signature Organic Creamy Peanut Butter

Costco shoppers took to social media over the summer to report the Kirkland Signature Organic Creamy Peanut Butter an extremely popular pantry staple was disappearing from warehouse shelves. The peanut butter favorite also vanished from the website as of July 26th. B

ut even though this product was gone for months of 2021 the 2-pack 28-ounce containers are now back. So Costco shoppers can breathe a sigh of relief knowing that they can start 2022 by filling their carts with this creamy peanut butter.

Coke Energy

One item that won't be popping back up on grocery shelves anytime soon is Coke Energy. Coca-Cola attempted to break into the energy drink space with this product but unfortunately it missed the mark. According to Coke executives the cut was made based on low sales so these cans were no longer sold in North America as of May 2021.

But if you're looking for a new energy drink to replace Coke Energy we've ranked them with the help of registered dietitians.

Canned Goods

An aluminum can shortage from 2020 is sadly still impacting our ability to get canned goods as we head into 2022. Grocery stores are getting far fewer of the canned items they ordered which means that shelves are left bare and customers aren't able to find what they're looking for. Specifically the canned goods that many have reported were tough to find at the end of the summer were tomato paste canned tomatoes and tomato sauce.

Kraft Fat-Free Mayo

This summer Kraft decided to call it quits on their Fat-Free Mayo so if that was your go-to mayo product it's time to find a new one. Kraft shared the news via Twitter on July 26th—and reported that the reason for its disappearance is due to the fact that it doesn't compare to the full-fat version especially when it comes to flavor and texture.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

In addition to the brand's ""Real Mayo"" they also make a version with avocado oil and another with olive oil. So if you're looking for a replacement for the Fat-Free Mayo you have options.

Toilet Paper

Just like paper towels toilet paper has been a tough find in the grocery store throughout the pandemic and unfortunately it lasted all 2021. Costco started up their one-unit purchase limit on Kirkland Signature Toilet Paper again this summer. So you definitely want to grab toilet paper when you see it on shelves because that's not something you want to run out of at your house. Here's to hoping the toilet paper supply increases in 2022.

Litehouse's Freeze-Dried Garlic

A spice favorite at Costco Litehouse's Freeze-Dried Garlic will no longer be available in that giant container at the warehouse. The claim was initially made on Reddit and then confirmed by a spokesperson for Litehouse that the garlic will indeed be disappearing from shelves.

The good news is that the brand will be replacing the garlic with some new products popping up at Costco warehouses in the near future like a blue cheese salad dressing and a freeze-dried herbs variety pack. So at least there's some good news to come out of this disappearing product.

Pumpkin

Due to a fungus that's been affecting pumpkin plants in Illinois it could be difficult to find canned pumpkin going into the New Year. Bet you didn't realize that the majority of canned pumpkin products sold nationwide come out of Illinois—well they do. And it's because of this that you could be missing them on your grocery store shelves nationwide. Hopefully this issue will be resolved the next time you're looking to make a pumpkin pie.

How many properties does the Queen have as she spends Christmas at Windsor castle

The Queen will be spending her Christmas at Windsor Castle.

Her traditional Christmas address is expected to have a more personal touch this year as she spends her first Christmas without Prince Philip the Duke of Edinburgh having died earlier this year.

She will spend Christmas day with Prince Charles and Camilla but won't be joined by daughter Princess Anne as she is self-isolating after her husband tested positive for the coronavirus.

The usual Christmas plans of spending Christmas with the family at Sandringham in Norfolk have been cancelled as cases of the virus continue to rise in the UK.

Prince William and Kate Middleton will be home in Norfolk joined by other members of the Middleton family.

The Queen has an extensive list of options for places she can choose to spend her Christmas.

The Queen's property portfolio

As expected the UK's head of state has a huge list of lands to her name and this goes beyond just royal palaces like Buckingham Palace Windsor Castle Balmoral and Sandringham. The Crown's property portfolio is worth billions.

However there is a difference between what the Queen owns herself and what is owned by the Crown.

There is also a vast amount of land to the monarch's name in the form of the Crown Estate.

The Crown Estate cannot be sold and any revenue gained from it does not go directly to the monarch. It is managed by an independent organisation and any excess revenue is paid to the treasury.

So what properties does the Queen own herself?

Properties owned by the Queen

Sandringham House in Norfolk is owned by the Queen and also has Amner House in the grounds. It was inherited to her from her father.

This is one of two properties that the Queen directly owns the other is her ""paradise in the highlands"" at Balmoral.

Balmoral and Sandringham are the two properties with which the Queen can do as she pleases she can choose to give them away to family members or sell them on if she so chooses.

Balmoral is a particular favourite of the Queen's so she is unlikely to be selling it on any time soon.

The two luxurious palaces provide a bit of normality in the life of the monarch. According to Hello! wife of former Prime Minister Tony Blair Cherie Blair said of life at Balmoral: ""You think I’m joking but I’m not. They put the gloves on and stick their hands in the sink.

""The Queen asks if you’ve finished she stacks the plates up and goes off to the sink.""

Properties owned by the Crown Estate

According to the Land Registry in 2019 the Crown owns a total of 7936 plots in England and Wales.

The Crown Estate website explains: ""The Crown Estate belongs to the reigning monarch 'in right of The Crown' that is it is owned by the monarch for the duration of their reign by virtue of their accession to the throne.

""But it is not the private property of the monarch - it cannot be sold by the monarch nor do revenues from it belong to the monarch.""

Windsor Castle and Buckingham Palace are just small parts of the Crown Estate that also includes big hitters like Ascot Racecourse the Palace of Holyroodhouse Hillsborough Castle in Northern Ireland The Ritz Tower of London Hampton Court Palace Kew Palace and Banqueting House to name but a few.

There are also stranger properties like Silverlink Shopping Park in South Tyneside the John Lewis Distribution Centre in Milton Keynes and Scarborough Castle.

The Mirror has a full rundown of the properties here.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vYWlybWFpbC5uZXdzL2lzc3Vlcy8yMDIxLTEyLTI1L3Njb3R0aXNoLXBsYXnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Scottish Play - Welcome to Scotland's Fife Arms Hotel,"If all those scenes of Balmoral Castle in The Crown as well as the latest Princess Diana movie have you longing to stalk the moody majestic Scottish moors the Fife Arms could be the answer to your prayers.

Top the building which dates to the 19th century is located only a few miles from the Queen’s country estate at Balmoral; above the interior design nods to Scottish heritage while loudly declaring its 21st-century attitude.

Located in Braemar only a few miles from the Queen’s country estate in Balmoral the 19th-century inn was acquired a few years ago by Swiss gallery owners Iwan and Manuela Wirth co-founders of Hauser & Wirth galleries. They gave the property a complete top-to-bottom renovation.

From top a bed designed for sleeping in; the Artist’s Studio makes an elegant venue for a Zoom call; the quirky bathrooms are an antidote to the overly bland designs that are de rigueur at many hotels.

The result is a 46-room refuge that feels like a boutique hotel albeit one dropped down in the midst of breathtaking landscapes. But the views aren’t just on the grounds or out the windows; they’re also on the walls. Taking advantage of their day jobs the Wirths have stippled the inn’s baroque décor with pieces by Lucian Freud Man Ray Louise Bourgeois and other artists.

Top﻿ a portrait of artist Timothy Behrens by Lucian Freud hangs in the lobby; above one of several spots to procure a quality cocktail.

But don’t worry: they’ve retained many of the period and local touches—from stags’ heads and antlers on the walls to tweed coats and kilts on the staff. The best touch of all however may be the Artist’s Studio. Perched at the top of the stone building it not only affords views of the Cairngorms a range of local mountains but makes you feel like you’re in a private garret as it draws on the life of Duncan Grant a local artist who became a leading member of the Bloomsbury Group. Along with other artists he transformed a nearby farmhouse into a live-in work of art by painting on the walls and doors. It’s a room that inspires and invites. And unlike Princess Diana you’ll actually find yourself longing to return to this part of Scotland.

REVIEW Christmas with a Crown Stars: 3.0 Starring Lisa Durupt Marcus Rosner Teryl Rothery Michael Lazarovitch Diana-Marie Stolz and Jesse Gervais Written by Michael Varrati Directed by Dylan Pearce Unrated but suitable for all audiences Runtime: 87 minutes Now Available on DVD Video on Demand and on various cable providers including Rogers Bell Telus Shaw and Super Channel christmaswithacrown.com

Whether you love the royalty or not we can all agree: everyone loves holiday-themed romantic comedies. Now there's a royally wonderful movie that has just been released for viewing on multiple platforms and it's certain to leave everyone feeling warm and fuzzy like a pair of wool slippers.

Christmas with a Crown is director Dylan Pearce's spirited seasonal entrée that bears shades of Coming to America courtesy of the script by Michael Varrati. Pearce is no stranger to the rom-com as Christmas Cupcakes and A Frosty Affair (renamed from 40 Below and Falling) will attest while Varrati is the ahem seasoned veteran of writing contemporary holiday-viewing fare with a filmography that includes A Christmas Mission A Christmas in Vermont Broadcasting Christmas and A Christmas Reunion (coupled with genre variations such as Deathcember the 'Der Krampus' of TV's History of Fright).

In this fun frosty flick Cassie (Lisa Durupt) is a successful businesswoman who returns to her hometown and works to try to save its Christmas festival. One of the volunteers is a handsome stranger. It seems that Prince Nicolas (Marcus Rosner) is having a spot of bother with his royal family and its many obligations. He escapes to live for himself but can one ever escape their family especially around the holidays?

I digress.

Crown is still every bit the cinematic confection you'd expect it to be and should make for enjoyable viewing for those who would press ""play"" on something new as opposed to re-watching Janet Leigh and Robert Mitchum in The Holiday Affair. Add to that how Pearce brought the filming to Edmonton and around St. Albert thanks to Alberta's climate and Ryan's Castle. Located north of the Villeneuve Airport the luxurious bed and breakfast was the perfect location for shooting scenes with royal characters.

At least the castle was reliable Pearce explained.

""We were lucky we had snow. That was a big thing"" he recalled.

""As for the filming itself what was great was that Edmonton has always been a really film-friendly city. We worked with the ESIO [Edmonton Screen Industries Office]. They helped bring the film to life. We were able to make it Christmas on Whyte Ave. in the heart of the art space in Edmonton which was great too"" he added noting that the production team installed Christmas decorations at West Edmonton Mall which explains a lot of the confused looks on the faces of many shoppers early last spring.

For those and other reasons the movie should have a built-in audience around the capital region but Pearce was recently gifted a shout-out that brought it to the world’s attention too. TV’s The Late Show host Stephen Colbert joked about people’s holiday traditions which included a quick list of holiday films.

“That was quite a surprise. He's someone I watch all the time. Just to be poked a little bit by him is a dream come true. It was pretty pretty great” the director commented obviously pleased with the mention and certainly taking the road that no publicity is bad publicity.

“It was a wonderful experience for the cast and crew and now we have a fun quote with him calling our film a 'soon-to-be no doubt Christmas classic' with his satire behind it. I thought it was great.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay9mZW1haWwvYXJ0aWNsZS0xMDE4MjY3NS9JbnRyb2R1Y2luZy1GcmVkZHktS25hdGNoYnVsbC0xOC1ncmVhdC1ncmFuZHNvbi1Mb3JkLU1vdW50YmF0dGVuLmh0bWzSAX1odHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvZmVtYWlsL2FydGljbGUtMTAxODI2NzUvYW1wL0ludHJvZHVjaW5nLUZyZWRkeS1LbmF0Y2hidWxsLTE4LWdyZWF0LWdyYW5kc29uLUxvcmQtTW91bnRiYXR0ZW4uaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Introducing Freddy Knatchbull 18 great-grandson of Lord Mountbatten,"Handsome humble and boasting royal ties up-and-coming model Freddy Knatchbull ticks all the boxes of a high-society heartthrob.

The 18-year-old is the son of Curzon Cinemas CEO Philip Knatchbull 60 grandson of 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma and his second wife Wendy.

His fashion designer sister Daisy is friends with the Manners sisters of The Crown's Belvoir Castle and his girlfriend is Tatler cover girl Delphi Primrose 18 daughter of Sotheby's boss Lord Dalmeny.

Yet despite his impeccable social connections it was Freddy's looks not his phone book that landed him a contract with SELECT Model Management.

Athletic and chiselled the 6ft 1in teenager was scouted while walking down London's Oxford Street 'and it took off from there' he told FEMAIL.

But having a famous surname certainly doesn't hurt.

'It would be naive of me not to accept that my family background will give me an initial advantage in the modelling world' he said.

'But it cuts both ways. People might judge me without getting to know me first. A sort of judging a book by its cover situation. '[Ultimately] I hope to develop my own identity through my hard work and dedication.'

Standing out from the crowd: Athletic and chiselled 6ft 1in Freddy was scouted while walking down London's Oxford Street 'and it took off from there'

Freddy lives at home with his parents London and is taking a gap year before going on to university where he hopes to study politics.

Unlike many other privileged young men in his position Freddy prefers to keep a low profile on Instagram and doesn't make a habit of showing up at flash parties.

'I love playing sports and I always have' he said. 'I’m a massive Arsenal fan and love playing football I also play a lot of basketball and support the Los Angeles Lakers and I love going to the gym.

'I really enjoy acting although I haven't had as many chances to do so since I finished school. I also like fishing whether that be fly fishing in the River Test or deep sea fishing in the Atlantic.

'My father is in the film business and I love going to the cinema with him and watching the latest films.'

Philip Knatchbull is the son of Patricia Knatchbull 2nd Countess Mountbatten of Burma the eldest daughter of the Duke of Edinburgh's beloved uncle 'Dickie' Mountbatten.

Philip's younger brother Nicholas was among those killed in the 1979 IRA bombing that claimed the life of his grandfather.

Freddy grew up hearing stories of his great-grandfather. 'It was nice to hear the private side of the public persona' Freddy said.

Philip has a daughter Daisy with his first wife Atalanta Cowan and shares Freddy and John 17 with Wendy.

'My family is very supportive and have always been' Freddy said. 'I love them to bits and it makes me very happy that they are so excited for me.

'My Mum was also a professional model and gives me loads of advice about modelling.'

He also swaps tips with his girlfriend of six months Delphi Primrose a descendant of 19th century Prime Minister Archibald Philip Primrose 5th Earl of Rosebery who is signed to Storm Models famous for discovering Kate Moss.

Freddy recently 'got very close' to being cast in the lead of a new Netflix show - he remains tight-lipped on the details - after making it 'through a lot of casting rounds'

'We chat about it a lot and we’re both very supportive of each other's careers' he said. 'We love going to events together and we would really like to work together on a shoot.'

Most recently the hot new society couple were spotted at Tatler's star-studded Little Black Book party.

His sister Daisy 29 who introduced Delphi and Freddy is founder of The Deck a made-to-measure tailoring house exclusively for women which has been spotted on the likes of Jodie Whittaker Liz Hurley and the Duchess of York.

'Daisy is one of the best in the industry and has been very helpful with giving me advice' Freddy said. 'I’m very proud to be her brother.'

Whatever advice he is following it is working.

Freddy recently 'got very close' to being cast in the lead of a new Netflix show - he remains tight-lipped on the details - after making it 'through a lot of casting rounds'.

'I didn’t land the role in the end but it has sort of inspired me to lean towards maybe doing some acting. It is not uncommon for models to end up in the acting industry' he said.

'I'm very comfortable being in front of the camera. It definitely does come naturally. The way I pose my expression and the direction can really help bring clothing alive on a model. The communication between photographer and model is really important for me.'

Now Freddy would like to work with brands he 'wears every day' like Burberry Gucci Prada and Calvin Klein.

He added: 'I’ve been able to work with some amazing people and I’m really looking forward to the future.'",,,

RAVENNA Ky. — Chesapeake & Ohio 2-8-4 2716 will visit New England following its restoration the Kentucky Steam Heritage Corporation announced on Saturday.

Kentucky Steam has inked an agreement with the Railroad Museum of New England to bring the big main line steam locomotive to its Naugatuck Railroad in Connecticut at some point in the future for a months-long residency. The visit will kick off what is expected to be a year-long trip from its home base in Ravenna Ky. where it is currently being restored.

C&O 2716’s trip to Connecticut — which Kentucky Steam President Chris Campbell said could happen sometime in the middle part of the decade — would be the first visit of a main line steam locomotive to New England in more than a generation. Kentucky Steam said additional stops on its maiden tour would be announced at a later date.

“We’re pleased to be hosting C&O 2716 on our railroad as it will be the first large steam locomotive to operate in New England since (the 1970s)” said Howard Pincus chairman of RMNE. “It’s a wonderful opportunity to partner with a capable and visionary group like KSHC. Moving operational steam locomotives between heritage groups is quite common in Great Britain but has only been done a few times in the United States.”

While many small steam locomotives have operated in New England in recent decades visits by large main line steamers have been few and far between. In the 1960s and 1970s Nickel Plate Road 2-8-4 759 led excursions there for Steamtown and Ross Rowland’s High Iron Company. And in 1975 Reading Company 2101 lead the American Freedom Train all the way to Portland Maine. Since then the largest steam locomotive to grace New England’s main line rails has been Canadian Pacific 4-6-2 1201 which made a trek across northern Maine in 1989.

The exact dates of the visit have yet to be determined and officials said they would not be announced until certain restoration benchmarks had been met. However there were already plans in the works for excursions along the Naugatuck’s 19-mile line between Waterbury and Torrington Conn. and even photo freights.

Kentucky Steam has been restoring 2716 since 2015. The group also owns a 40-acre former CSX Transportation yard in Estill County Ky. where the work has been taking place. Campbell tells Railfan & Railroad that for the last few years the non-profit has been focusing on working on the shop facility itself. Now that a lot of that work has been completed they plan on focusing on the locomotive more which is about 30 percent done.

“We are several years off from making our way up east” he said. “But with announcements like this we hope people who have considered contributing to the restoration can see an end goal in sight. We are excited to get the engine fully operational and bring people to us in Kentucky. But we are equally as excited to get out on the road.”

Campbell said while Class I railroads including CSX and Norfolk Southern have been very generous to the non-profit it’s important to not simply rely or hope for chances to get out on their rails. He said that working with established short line and tourist operators will get 2716 in front of more people when the locomotive is again running.

Along with Saturday’s announcement KSHC is spearheading a fundraiser to secure $10000 for the locomotive’s restoration by the end of 2021. To make a project-dedicated tax-deductible donation to the locomotive’s rehab visit www.kentuckysteam.org/donate or by mail to Kentucky Steam Heritage Corporation 499 Kirkland Ave Irvine KY 40336.

""No one did anything wrong. The poor guy just flew to Adelaide to try and enjoy a couple of days of cricket - I felt really bad for him as well.""

Cummins' teammates Mitchell Starc and Nathan Lyon too would have missed the match as they were supposed to join him for dinner at the same restaurant but since the skipper didn't check his phone for 40 minutes the two dined separately.

""They walked in angry - they kicked up a stink and sat out the back"" he said of Lyon and Starc.

The Australian Test captain was a dramatic withdrawal from the team on the morning of the Adelaide match ruled out under South Australian COVID-19 rules because he was deemed a close contact.

Cummins had gone out to dinner at a steak restaurant in Adelaide with a friend the night before and a patron at the next table was identified as a positive case.

So rather than lead his team Cummins was forced into isolation and eventually flew home to Sydney on a private plane.

Cummins is back with the team and spoke about his saga on Christmas Day on the eve of the Boxing Day Ashes Test.

'I (was) really angry - but I don't know who at' he said at MCG training.

'There was no-one to blame.

'Once it became apparent the state rules you have to follow them.'

Cummins left the restaurant as soon as he learnt about the positive case and initially thought that a negative test for him would be the end of it.

But it quickly became clear that was not the case.

'We knew it might pop at some stage in this series. I didn't think - or hope - it was going to be me' he said.

'No-one did anything wrong. The poor guy just flew to Adelaide to try and enjoy a couple of days of cricket - I felt really bad for him as well.'

It could have been even worse with teammates Mitch Starc and Nathan Lyon dining outside at the same restaurant.

They were supposed to be sitting with Cummins but he hadn't checked his phone for 40 minutes and so they lost patience and dined separately.

Had Cummins checked his phone earlier it could have been all three of them out of the Test.

'They walked in angry - they kicked up a stink and sat out the back' he said of Lyon and Starc.

'It's just one player it's slightly bigger news because it's COVID and the captain but it's not the end of the world it's not a huge change.'

It was the first time Cummins had missed a home Test in about five years and initially he thought he would cope.

So when pharmacy chains and big-box stores began expanding into rural markets he sold his drugstore in 2007 to Pamida a grocery chain owned by the Shopko department store company hoping that would keep his practice alive. Then in 2019 when Shopko declared bankruptcy shuttering more than 360 stores he and another Shopko pharmacist helped open a new drugstore for the city of about 2000 people.

Across the country pharmacists like Mather are filling the voids left when large drugstore chains and big-box stores with pharmacies pull out of small communities. In some areas pharmacists who were let go when big chains closed are now opening new drugstores often in the same locations. In other areas pharmacy owners from neighboring towns are opening new branches. Without them numerous communities would have been left with no pharmacy.

It didn’t used to be this way. Big-box stores like Shopko started to move aggressively into the pharmacy market 30 years ago hoping customers would fill their carts while the store filled their prescriptions. Large chains established beachheads in small towns by acquiring independent pharmacies or driving them out of business.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics the number of pharmacists employed at big-box stores peaked at more than 31800 in 2012. But as online sales and mail delivery of consumer goods and prescription drugs grew the big-box stores had no reason to stay. By 2019 the number of big-box pharmacists had dropped to fewer than 18000. (The bureau no longer reports the number.)

“The big-box stores came into smaller and smaller communities and they in essence outcompeted all the other pharmacies in the area” said David Zgarrick a pharmacy professor at Northeastern University in Boston. “Now they’re completely gone and with them the pharmacy services and everything else they provided. They left a vacuum in a lot of these places.”

With CVS Health’s recent announcement that it will close 300 stores a year over the next three years more towns could lose another tier of pharmacies: the big drugstore chains. CVS has not yet said which stores will close.

“We’re considering a number of factors when making these decisions including local market dynamics population shifts store density and the needs of underserved communities” said Mike DeAngelis a CVS Health spokesperson. “In fact reaching underserved populations has been a priority for us all through the pandemic such as the access to testing and vaccines we’ve provided.”

Kathleen Bashur a spokesperson for the National Association of Chain Drug Stores said chain pharmacies of all types and sizes play a significant role in meeting the health and wellness needs of communities throughout the nation. “The decision to close a store is a difficult one” she said.

Zgarrick attributes much of the decline in big-box pharmacies to Amazon and other online merchants that undercut the profitability of their non-pharmacy sales. In the past big-box stores could treat pharmacies as loss leaders and make up that revenue with sales of other goods. Now Zgarrick said big-box stores have to ask tough questions about how to allocate their space: “‘At the end of the day how are we going to make the most money per square foot? Is it by having a pharmacy or by selling tires?’”

Nelson Lichtenstein a University of California-Santa Barbara history professor who has chronicled the rise of Walmart said big-box stores are constantly reevaluating their store locations closing less profitable stores and opening new ones in places where they think they can make money.

“They just keep a kind of slow churn” he said.

The cost of building a big-box store is about $10 million Lichtenstein said and such stores can net $200 million in annual revenue. Pulling out of a location is therefore not a huge loss for a big company if revenues falter.

“So they will shut down the stores and leave a devastated town because the Walmart put the other guys out of business” he said.

Walmart did not answer questions about its closures.

The growth in online options for all kinds of items spurred by people shopping from home during the COVID-19 pandemic has put more pressure on big-box stores.

“Now they’re less likely to do that roaming shopping than they were five years ago” said Adam Hartung a business strategy consultant with Spark Partners. “They’re not going to say ‘Oh let’s pick up a prescription and while we’re at it let’s walk through the store and look at vacuum cleaners.’ That doesn’t happen anymore.”

Hartung said that the U.S. retail market has an excess of shops by as much as 40 percent compared with other countries and that more big-box stores are likely to close in the coming years.

But closures provide opportunities for regional chains or pharmacists willing to strike out on their own.

In Orofino Idaho the mayor the chamber of commerce and many residents appealed to pharmacist Rod Arnzen after Shopko pulled out. So Arnzen began delivering to Orofino from his store 23 miles away in Kamiah. He then opened a branch in Orofino in the building left behind by the pharmacy that had previously sold its business to Shopko.

Andy Pottenger who owns a pharmacy 45 miles away in Lewiston Idaho added a second pharmacy in Orofino population about 3000 after receiving hundreds of responses to an ad he had placed in the local paper to gauge interest.

“It was overwhelming” he said. “That kind of cemented the idea that we should do it.”

In Montana Mike Matovich a third-generation pharmacist opened stores in Roundup and Hardin after Shopko closures there.

“It’s a pretty good-sized community and has a hospital and clinic in town” Matovich said of Roundup “and all of a sudden people are driving 50 miles one way to fill an antibiotic for a sick child.”

Matovich has seen what can happen when a rural community loses its only pharmacy.

“If there’s a hospital clinic and a pharmacy there they’re going to do fairly well” Matovich said. “Once you lose one or the other the communities start to struggle because people start leaving to be closer to health care.”

For the residents of Greenfield Iowa Shopko’s decision meant they had to scramble. Shopko had sold the pharmacy records to a Walgreens 50 miles away. Some people turned to the Hy-Vee grocery stores in the nearby Iowa cities of Atlantic or Winterset or to the Walmart in Creston — each at least a half-hour drive away. Others switched to mail order.

“It was sheer chaos” former Shopko pharmacist Rachel Hall said. “People were trying to figure out what to do where they should send their prescriptions.”

Mather Hall and the rest of the Greenfield staff were given just one week’s notice after being told they had nothing to worry about. Their pharmacy had been among the chain’s fastest-growing locations.

“We literally had trophies from Shopko that we threw away when we left” Hall said.

Former Shopko executives contacted by KHN declined interview requests. Shopko Optical which operates in 11 states said it is no longer affiliated in any way with Shopko Stores and declined to comment.

Mather and Hall didn’t want to give up on Greenfield. They reached out to NuCara a chain with 30 retail pharmacies across five states and it agreed to help them open a drugstore in their city.

NuCara opened pharmacies in two other communities that Shopko vacated. In the Minnesota cities of Cokato and North Branch NuCara partnered with pharmacists who had previously sold their pharmacies to Shopko said Brett Barker vice president of pharmacies for NuCara.

In Greenfield Hall and Mather were forbidden from telling customers about the new NuCara drugstore until Shopko officially closed its doors. Hall said Shopko management wanted to maintain the value of the customer files it was selling to Walgreens. So Hall and Mather asked the local chamber of commerce to get the word out.

They found temporary space at the local hospital which relocated its billing office to accommodate them. A year later they moved back into their former location in the old Shopko building leasing the space from new owners who were running a household goods store there.

After serving three generations of Greenfield customers Mather was relieved the town still had a pharmacy. But he couldn’t get past how Shopko had ended things.

“The way they slammed the door I was really unhappy about that” Mather said. “It wasn’t fair to all the people at the Greenfield pharmacy and the people of Greenfield. Shopko couldn’t have cared less.”

Yet the move brought Mather full circle. Greenfield still has a pharmacy just as when he started at Murdy Drug in 1968. It’s just a different storefront with a new name on the sign.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd2VzdGZhaXJvbmxpbmUuY29tL2NvdXJ0cy9jdnMtYmxhbWVzLXdlbGRlcnMtYW5kLWRyeS1jbGVhbmVyLWZvci01bS1maXJlLWF0LWxhcmNobW9udC1zdG9yZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,CVS blames welders and dry cleaner for $5 million fire at Larchmont store,"CVS Health Corp. is demanding compensation from welders and a dry cleaner for a fire that caused more than $5 million in damages three years ago at its Larchmont store.

The Woonsocket Rhode Island pharmacy chain accused Excelsior of Larchmont Inc. Joe’s Onsite Welding Inc. and Rivertown General Contracting Inc. of negligence in a complaint filed Dec. 13 in Westchester Supreme Court.

The fire broke out on Dec. 19 2018 in the Excelsior Cleaners store in Ferndale Center West Boston Post Road according to court records and caused at least $7 million in damages.

Excelsior had hired Joe’s of Briarcliff Manor to weld rebar in the store according to the complaint and Rivertown of Irvington allegedly loaned one of its employees to help with the job.

As the rebar was being cut sparks ignited clothing plastic bags and dry-cleaning chemicals. Fire spread quickly to the CVS next door and throughout the 84000-square-foot shopping center.

CVS claims that the defendants did not get a work permit for the job; did not remove flammable materials from the work site; did not maintain electrical and mechanical systems that would have prevented or limited fire; failed to supervise workers to prevent a fire; and failed to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances.

Joe’s attorney Salvatore J. DeSantis declined to comment on the allegations as a matter of policy on pending lawsuits. Excelsior and Rivertown did not respond to an email asking for their sides of the story.

Two other lawsuits have been filed in the past 13 months in Westchester Supreme Court bringing the alleged damages to nearly $7 million.

Stop & Shop Supermarket Co. demanded $331296 from Excelsior and Joe’s in November 2020. Excelsior and Joe’s broadly denied the allegations in their answers to the complaint and they filed cross-claims blaming one another for the fire. The case is pending.

Tri-State Insurance Co. of Minnesota sued Joe’s and Rivertown for negligence this past October to recover more than $1.6 million it paid to Excelsior on in insurance claim for the dry cleaner’s losses.

Joe’s denied the allegations and Rivertown has not yet filed an answer to the complaint. The case is pending.

But ultimately the city exhausted its store of kits before Thursday’s giveaway scheduled for Waterview Recreation Center in the city’s East Germantown neighborhood.

For several weeks the health department says that it has been trying to obtain new tests to no avail.

“We’ve had out purchases to try to buy more of these [tests] so we can have more on hand and be able to give more out” Garrow said.

He said the current demand was “unprecedented” even after more than a year of pandemic worry.

The city has seen a rise in interest at its testing sites for all kinds of tests — PCR antigen and at-home test kits. Rapid tests are particularly in demand as people make plans to travel.

National pharmacy chains have already put a cap on how many at-home tests customers can buy. Some pharmacies and health care offices don’t let people schedule testing unless they’ve already shown signs of symptoms. Those that are able to get through the scheduling system are given appointment slots many days in advance — often well past the day they wish to gather with loved ones.

In a statement a Rite Aid spokesperson said the chain has “seen increasingly high demand for rapid testing.” It is instead encouraging those seeking the sought-after testing kits and rapid tests to instead utilize their drive-thru COVID-19 PCR test with results in 2-5 days.

CVS Pharmacy said that it has added a limit of six test kits per purchase both in store and digitally. Due to the surge in demand and to retain community-based access to tests in stores the chain said there may be temporary out-of-stocks for at-home tests at this time. It will continue to conduct on-site testing — with a warning that results may be delayed because of the high level of demand.

And while the White House has a plan to distribute 500 million free at-home COVID tests across the nation the website to request these tests isn’t expected to be active until after the winter holidays are over.

“This is definitely a market problem” said Garrow. “We are actively looking everywhere we can to try to identify sites where we can purchase more tests and calling around.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2hlYWx0aGNhcmUtcGhhcm1hY2V1dGljYWxzL3JvY2hlLXNheXMtYXQtaG9tZS1jb3ZpZC0xOS1yYXBpZC10ZXN0LWdldHMtb2stZmRhLTIwMjEtMTItMjQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Roche says at-home COVID-19 rapid test gets ok from FDA,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/roche-says-at-home-covid-19-rapid-test-gets-ok-fda-2021-12-24/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2hlYWx0aGNhcmUtcGhhcm1hY2V1dGljYWxzL3JvY2hlLXNheXMtYXQtaG9tZS1jb3ZpZC0xOS1yYXBpZC10ZXN0LWdldHMtb2stZmRhLTIwMjEtMTItMjQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

So the new Sea Ranger MMS 55 provides the perfect antidote for serious cruisers. A trawler yacht in the true sense of the word it borrows not just its looks and hull shape from a genuine North Sea trawler but also its bulletproof build quality and heavy-weather seakeeping.

Built at a commercial shipyard in Hull from 7mm thick plate steel and weighing a mighty 60 tonnes it has the kind of offshore integrity which most GRP craft can only dream of.

Twin 180hp heavy duty cycle John Deere diesels designed to run for 5000 hours a year and a Category A-rated hull with a towering bow and decks littered with scuppers should allow it to push through seas which would send most craft running for home. And thanks to a fuel capacity of 6400 litres it will keep on plodding at 8 knots for over 1500nm.

One thousand litres of grey and 500 litres of black water capacity further enhance its offshore cruising capability. A six-person Zodiac with 15hp outboard is housed on the foredeck next to a launch crane and liferaft.

AS THE FALL SEMESTER draws to a close so does the eighth and possibly final week of Columbia University’s graduate student worker strike. Earlier today the graduate student union and Columbia entered mediation that has the potential to end the biggest labor struggle in the country. On each of the union’s three main demands—increased wages dental and vision insurance and neutral arbitration for allegations of harassment and discrimination—a compromise appears to have been reached such that the total cost to Columbia will be $57.2 million over the next three years $30.4 million less than the union’s original proposal.

If things resolve as they appear likely to the relatively good outcome will have been the result of tenacious organizing that has been going on for far longer than the past two months. “The administration being intransigent and dismissive or abusive has been a constant for years” said Jon Ben-Menachem a second-year PhD candidate in the sociology department. Indeed although the Student Workers of Columbia-United Auto Workers (SWC-UAW) labor union was formed in 2016 Columbia refused to recognize the union until 2019 three years after the National Labor Relations Board ruled that teaching assistants are indeed workers under federal labor law. When Columbia finally deigned to appear at the bargaining table the main issue at stake was the scope of the NLRB ruling and what types of students it covered. But as tensions mounted after years of unsuccessful bargaining and stonewalling from the university Columbia graduate students formulated a far more comprehensive set of demands.

Most of these were fairly standard for a union striking for better labor conditions. SWC is demanding that student workers earn at least $40000 while on appointment and receive a 3% annual raise. They also want hourly workers to make at least $22 dollars per hour and for the university to apply “reasonable effort” to cover matriculation and facilities fees past the fifth year of PhDs when guaranteed funding typically runs out. They originally demanded both dental and vision insurance be covered by the university healthcare plan but have agreed to cut vision in the latest round of compromises. Where SWC is unique however is in its demands for neutral third-party arbitration for allegations of sexual harassment and discrimination.

Columbia is no stranger to high-profile sexual harassment cases. In just the past three years the university’s internal investigations found that at least three tenured professors had engaged in inappropriate sexual activities with students ranging from illicit years-long relationships to instances of sexual assault. But there are also cases where Columbia hasn’t found itself guilty and thus far in the bargaining process the university has insisted that all allegations go through their internal Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action (EOAA) office with the addition of a “neutral lawyer” who has no ability to actually investigate discrimination or harrassment. Johannah King-Slutzky a third-year PhD candidate in the English department referred to the university’s tactic of offering “extremely limited arbitration scope” as “a very cynical ploy.”

Over the course of the strike Columbia has also threatened to cut grad student pay and to replace all 3000 striking workers and has changed payment disbursement schedules to disincentivize students from striking. Joshua Freeman Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Labor History at the City University of New York is unsurprised by Columbia’s blatant union-busting. “The vast majority of graduate students are not at elite universities” Freeman said. “The story that gets the most attention is the fancy school the private school. Columbia’s not different from any private employer and private employers hate unions.”

“The narrative at elite universities is that they’re students not workers” he added. “They’d always argue that there’s a mentor-mentee relationship. You don’t hear that anymore since that language is kind of sullied by stories of sexual exploitation and harassment.”

It’s also sullied by the fact that PhD programs have increasingly come to resemble cheap labor schemes rather than professional training programs designed to produce tenure-track professors. “That’s why organizing has gotten stronger” said Ben-Menachem. “At the end of the day PhD programs are not livable for people who don’t have intergenerational wealth.”

In the three years since Columbia recognized its graduate students as workers under federal law it has given the union plenty of reasons to become more effective organizers. After narrowly voting down a tentative agreement reached in March the union elected a new bargaining board and reorganized its leadership structure to give rank-and-file members greater say in its proceedings. Rather than accept the March agreement Columbia grad students have been galvanized to continue fighting a reluctant administration for a fair contract.

Freeman linked SWC’s persistence to recent labor actions in other sectors of the economy including John Deere workers refusing two contracts and finally accepting a third as well as Kellogg’s workers finally reaching a contract after eleven weeks of negotiations. When I asked him whether this might signal a shift in workers’ attitudes toward their employers across all industries he was cautiously optimistic: “I think the numbers [of striking workers] are relatively small at this point so it’s mostly anecdotal. But it kind of looks like that yeah—it looks like something’s going on.”

Update: On Thursday night several hours after this newsletter was sent out Columbia made a proposal to the SWC. After caucusing for several hours union members voted to reject over insufficient union recognition and contract length.

“Unfortunately the university continues to union-bust by insisting that some classifications of workers would be excluded beyond the scope of the NLRB’s definition of our unit particularly workers who are paid hourly rather than on a salary” said Johannah King-Slutzky. “As a result basic workplace protections would disappear for many workers in the union.

Delta Air Lines canceled her Christmas Day flight from Seoul to New Orleans via Atlanta.

The 26-year-old English teacher hasn't been home since 2019 due to the pandemic and the pricey Delta business class ticket was her Christmas present.

Hernandez immediately called Delta to figure out a new flight. Despite his top level frequent flier status which comes with a dedicated phone line the medical device consultant was on hold for about 30 minutes before rebooking a flight that still gets her home on Christmas.

""Had my daughter called she would still be on the phone just waiting to get through'' he said.

Travelers with last-minute holiday flights this year are scrambling to find new flights as two major U.S. airlines Delta and United have canceled hundreds of Christmas Eve and Christmas flights. They cite crew shortages due to sick calls from the fast spreading omicron variant and weather in pockets of the country.

United canceled 196 Christmas Eve flights or 10% of scheduled flights Delta 171 or 8% as of 9:30 p.m. ET according to flight tracker FlightAware. Christmas Day cancellations for the two airlines stood a 243 for Delta and 168 for United. Christmas Day is one of the lightest travel days of the holiday travel rush. JetBlue is also having issues with 150 Christmas Eve and Christmas day flights canceled or 7% of its scheduled flights.

Delta said late Friday morning that it expects the cancellations to continue into Sunday a busy travel day ahead of the new work week with an additional 150 cancellations expected that day.

""We apologize to our customers for the delay in their holiday travel plans'' Delta spokeswoman Kate Modolo said in a statement. ""Delta people are working hard to get them to where they need to be as quickly and as safely as possible on the next available flight.''

The airline which just a week ago bragged to investors about its strong operational performance this year and staffing levels amid flight woes at other airlines this year said travelers should check the airline's website and mobile app for the latest information and rebooking assistance.

Callers to Delta's general customer service line were quoted a wait of two hours and 43 minutes late Friday morning. United was quoting a 25- to 30-minute wait. A recording on United's reservations line said ""significant weather'' has impacted its call center staffing and urged travelers without flights in the next 72 hours to call back later.

Airlines have struggled with long wait times as travel surged this year.

The holiday flight cancellations have travelers with upcoming flights on edge and checking their flight status repeatedly.

Is my United flight canceled?

Ohio accountant Jason Chadwell is due to fly United from Cleveland to Las Vegas on Christmas. He heard about the flight cancellations early Friday and has been checking United's website and app every couple hours. So far his evening flight shows on schedule.

Chadwell and his wife have tickets to two shows a Christmas gift from their children and dinner reservations at restaurants run by celebrity chefs from their favorite cooking shows. It is his wife's first trip to Las Vegas.

""It stresses me out because you've got plans you've got reservations out there'' he said.

ATLANTA — Thousands of travelers woke up to a Christmas Eve nightmare after Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines alerted passengers their flights were canceled.

Delta is one of several major airlines delaying and canceling flights ahead of Christmas citing a worker shortage due to COVID-19.

“Delta teams have exhausted all options and resources -- including rerouting and substitutions of aircraft and crews to cover scheduled flying -- before canceling around 135 flights for Friday"" a Delta spokesperson said in a statement.

According to flight-tracking website FlightAware Delta canceled 39 flights out of Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport and another 22 were listed as delayed Friday morning. The Atlanta-based airline has canceled nearly 140 flights out of the U.S. according to listings.

""We apologize to our customers for the delay in their holiday travel plans. Delta people are working hard to get them to where they need to be as quickly and as safely as possible on the next available flight” an airline spokesperson said.

As frustration builds there are a few options for travelers.

Create a Plan B before you fly

With the coronavirus pandemic and mass cancellations it is imperative that people hoping to fly around the holidays have backup plans for worst-case scenarios.

That could mean having a way to get to and from an airport in case of delays or cancellations and having an idea of lodging in the area. Keeping snacks and water at the ready can help especially if food is hard to find. Financial experts recommend planning for delays with extra funds in case one needs to purchase extra meals a new flight or any emergencies.

Check if your flight is canceled

Before making the trek to the airport double-check flight times.

This can be done by checking websites like FlightAware searching flight numbers in a search engine like Google checking an airline's website or downloading the airline's app for immediate notifications.

An easy way to predict if a flight will be canceled is to try and book the same flight as if purchasing a new ticket. If the flight number doesn't show up that’s typically an indication the flight would be canceled in the days to come or it's no longer for purchase. This is especially helpful for international flights.

What to do if your flight is canceled

First be patient.

Amid worker shortages and coronavirus concerns airline workers are trying to find efficient solutions. If a flight was canceled last-minute their solution might take a second to sort out.

Find other flight times with other airlines call your airline's customer service line and try to speak with an agent immediately. These are the ways one could get accommodations a waiver or rebook a ticket. Make sure to keep flight information handy for all of these options.

Oftentimes agents can help rebook flights or at least offer flight credit. Remember this doesn't always have to be done at the airport. If travel is time-sensitive it's OK to rebook a flight on another airline and deal with the issue remotely. In-person is better but staying on top of the issue in general will get results.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vQnVzaW5lc3MvYWlybGluZXMtY2FuY2VsLWhvbGlkYXktZmxpZ2h0cy1kdWUtb21pY3Jvbi1pbXBhY3RzLWNyZXdzL3N0b3J5P2lkPTgxOTIzNTQ30gFvaHR0cHM6Ly9hYmNuZXdzLmdvLmNvbS9hbXAvQnVzaW5lc3MvYWlybGluZXMtY2FuY2VsLWhvbGlkYXktZmxpZ2h0cy1kdWUtb21pY3Jvbi1pbXBhY3RzLWNyZXdzL3N0b3J5P2lkPTgxOTIzNTQ3?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Airlines cancel hundreds of holiday flights due to omicron impacts on crews,"As pre-pandemic level crowds hit airports for the the holidays four major U.S. airlines have canceled more than 900 Christmas Day flights due to the fast-spreading omicron variant of COVID-19.

As of Saturday afternoon Delta Airlines United Airlines JetBlue Airways and American Airlines had canceled a combined 950 Saturday flights.

Delta Air Lines canceled 308 flights on Christmas Day and has already canceled 69 flights scheduled for Sunday.

Saturday's cancellations come after United Delta and JetBlue canceled 454 Christmas Eve flights.

Delta Air Lines canceled 173 flights for Christmas Eve. The airline says the ""flight cancellations are due to a combination of issues including but not limited to potential inclement weather in some areas and the impact of the omicron variant.""

""Delta teams have exhausted all options and resources -- including rerouting and substitutions of aircraft and crews to cover scheduled flying -- before canceling around 90 flights for Friday"" Delta said in a Friday statement to ABC News.

And it's not just Delta that's feeling the impact of the variant on crews.

As of Saturday afternoon United had canceled 240 Christmas Day flights and 85 flights scheduled for Sunday. It had canceled 201 flights on Christmas Eve.

""The nationwide spike in omicron cases this week has had a direct impact on our flight crews and the people who run our operation"" United said in a statement on Friday. ""As a result we've unfortunately had to cancel some flights and are notifying impacted customers in advance of them coming to the airport.""

""We're sorry for the disruption and are working hard to rebook as many people as possible and get them on their way for the holidays"" the airline added.

JetBlue has canceled 123 Christmas Day flights due to COVID issues. It had canceled 80 flights Christmas Eve.

""Like many businesses and organizations we have seen an increasing number of sick calls from Omicron"" JetBlue said in a statement Friday. ""We entered the holiday season with the highest staffing levels we've had since the pandemic began and are using all resources available to us to cover our staffing needs. Despite our best efforts we've had to cancel a number of flights and additional flight cancellations and other delays remain a possibility as we see more Omicron community spread.""

Alaska Airlines has resorted to offering extra pay to their healthy employees who can work added shifts into this upcoming Christmas weekend.

The airline says they have had to cancel 10 Christmas Eve flights due to some of their employees quarantining after reporting that they may have been exposed to COVID-19.

American Airlines canceled 88 flights on Christmas Day.

""Our operation has been running smoothly and unfortunately a number of COVID-related sick calls led us to make the difficult decision to precancel some flights scheduled for today"" a representative for American Airlines said in a statement to ABC News on Saturday. ""We proactively notified affected customers yesterday and are working hard to rebook them quickly. We never want to disappoint our customers and apologize for any disruptions to their holiday travel plans.""

Airlines for America the group that lobbies on behalf of all major U.S. airlines is calling on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to shorten the quarantine time for fully vaccinated individuals saying the omicron surge may create ""significant"" disruptions.

""The omicron surge may exacerbate personnel shortages and create significant disruptions to our workforce and operations"" Nick Calio A4A's CEO said in a letter on Thursday to CDC Director Rochelle Walensky.

Calio proposed the isolation period to be shortened to five days from symptom onset for breakthrough infections.

FlightAware a flight-tracking website noted 888 flights entering leaving or inside the U.S. canceled Saturday up from 690 Friday. About 200 more flights were already canceled for Sunday

Delta United and JetBlue on Friday had all said the omicron variant was causing staffing problems leading to flight cancellations. United spokesperson Maddie King said staffing shortages were still causing cancellations and it was unclear when normal operations would return.

“This was unexpected” King said of omicron’s impact on staffing.

According to FlightAware the three airlines canceled more than 10% of their Saturday scheduled flights. American Airlines also canceled 90 flights Saturday about 3% of its schedule according to FlightAware. American spokesperson Derek Walls said the cancellations stemmed from “COVID-related sick calls” and the airline contacted customers on Friday. European and Australian airlines have also canceled holiday-season flights due to staffing problems tied to COVID.

Flight delays and cancellations tied to staffing shortages have been a regular problem for the U.S. airline industry this year. Airlines encouraged workers to quit in 2020 when air travel collapsed and were caught short-staffed this year as travel recovered.

To ease staffing shortages countries including Spain and the U.K. have reduced the length of COVID-19 quarantines by letting people return to work sooner after testing positive or being exposed to the virus.

Delta CEO Ed Bastian was among those who have called on the Biden administration to take similar steps or risk further disruptions in air travel. On Thursday the U.S. shortened COVID-19 isolation rules for health care workers only."

How to Create a Dividend Portfolio for Daily Cash

We can do this because most dividend stocks pay out on extremely consistent schedules. Investors love the certainty and dividend-paying companies try paying out in the same week even the same day every three months. That means with a little bit of strategy we can fill our portfolio with income stocks that will time our payments for every day of the week.

Now how this is going to work is through these three videos I’ll highlight those dividend income stocks that will be paying out in the next month. For example today we’ll highlight 17 dividend stocks that will pay out in December March June and September. I’ll show you exactly how I found these stocks later in the video but here you can see that I analyzed almost 400 dividend stocks to find the perfect income portfolio for each and every month.

The goal here is going to be about 60 stocks that will generate a dividend income on every weekday of each month. And the best part not only is this going to be a well-diversified portfolio producing constant dividends I’ve picked the best dividend stocks with a yield over 4%…that’s twice the average dividend yield on the market.

Dividend Stocks for Constant Cash Flow

Let’s jump right into that list then I’ll show you how I put together the portfolio of daily dividend stocks!

We’re getting started with a fan favorite Iron Mountain ticker IRM and one of the best dividend yields on the list at nine percent.

IRM is a records management provider with more than 225000 clients trusting it to store hard copy documents as well as digital transformations and storage. But the real value here comes in the form of the company’s real estate where all this is stored more than 90 million square feet across almost 1500 properties.

The company is set up as a real estate investment trust which means it gets a special tax break if it distributes at least 90% of profits to investors. That means you get that sky-high 9% yield with the stock going ex-dividend about mid-month in December March June and September.

IRM is a great start to our dividend portfolio and has grown its payout by 27% over the last five years.

Now remember the dates you’re going to see here on these dividend stocks are the ex-dividend date. How it works is a company’s Board of Directors declares the next dividend and the ex-dividend date. That ex-dividend date is the first day the shares trade WITHOUT the dividend so if you want that payout you want to make sure you pick up the shares at least one day before this.

The idea here isn’t to jump in or out of these dividend stocks so this isn’t going to matter as much to you long-term investors. Just put the stock in your portfolio and you’ll get that dividend every time it comes around.

Next on the list of daily dividend stocks powerhouse Altria Group ticker MO and its 8.8% dividend.

Now if you’re set against investing in some of these vice stocks then you can always substitute out another dividend payer that goes ex-dividend around the same time but for yield and dividend certainty it’s hard to beat Altria.

Besides owning the dominant tobacco brand in the U.S. and a dividend that has grown by 53% over the last five years Altria has some key investments that will help it grow. The company holds a 10% stake in the world’s largest brewer Anheuser-Busch and a 45% stake in cannabis giant Cronos Group. So you’ve got very stable cash flow from the tobacco and alcohol segments and that moonshot potential in cannabis.

Altria is one of the later stocks to go ex-dividend on our list late in December March June and September. That means you’ll usually get your dividend payment about two weeks later.

Our first stock in the financials $12 billion KeyCorp ticker KEY and its 5.8% dividend yield.

KeyCorp is a small regional bank with branches in 16 states but concentrated mostly in Ohio and New York. And those of you in the Nation now financials are one of my favorite sectors for the next couple of years. The sector has been slammed by low rates and is trading at a deep discount.

Case in point shares of KeyCorp trade for just 0.81-times book value which is a 38% discount to the 1.3 multiple it traded at last year. So potentially a lot of value to be unlocked if interest rates start heading higher and the economy keeps growing.

Beyond valuation and the high dividend yield KeyCorp has lately made some strong acquisitions in technology names like HelloWallet and Laurel Road which could give it surprise growth above other regional banks.

The dividend payment has boomed 146% over the past five years and usually goes ex-dividend during the first days of the month in December March June and August.

Another value play here $3.5 billion oil play Devon Energy ticker DVN and its 5% yield.

Next to financials energy is my other big call for the next few years and in fact I’ve added Devon Energy into our 2021 Bow Tie Nation portfolio on Stockcard.

If you’re looking for one sector where everyone is fearful and it may be time to be greedy it’s in the energy space. The price of oil crashed this year on loss of demand and the entire sector has fallen 49% year-to-date.

Will Oil Stocks Recover in 2021?

Being ahead of this means finding those cash-rich best of breed oil companies with the survivability to recover when the market does and Devon is one of the best in the space. The company has nearly $1.5 billion in balance sheet cash and will have no problem keeping up with its debt.

Despite dropping into negative earnings last quarter the company still beat the market estimate by 30% and is expected to return to profitability by the first quarter.

Shares usually go ex-dividend mid-month in December March June and September and paid out a special dividend August this year. Even the lowest analyst estimate has shares up 42% over the next year for a potentially huge upside along with the dividend.

Omnicom ticker OMC is the world’s second-largest ad holding company spanning public relations traditional and digital advertising.

Ad spending is the first to go when company budgets get tight so it’s no surprise that Omnicom has sold off this year but it’s still a solid company. The company has over $3.3 billion in balance sheet cash so no near-term financial problems and is trading at a discount of 38% from its peak.

Management has a history of beating expectations and is positioned to take advantage of the growth in digital ads. The dividend payment has grown a respectable 30% over the past five years and shares go ex-dividend early- to mid-month.

Adding some diversification here with Archer-Daniels Midland ticker ADM and its 2.9% dividend.

Agricultural producers have just started rebounding this year after years of trade war pain and I think there’s further to go for processors like ADM. The company has one of the largest networks for crop storage and transportation which should do well as the trade picture improves.

Even under the weaker environment the dividend here grew by 28% over the last five years and I expect that to pick up. Shares go ex-dividend mid- to late-month in November February May and August.

Another energy name here with Schlumberger Limited ticker SLB and its 3.3% dividend yield.

Now this one is probably the riskiest of my energy bets but still a fairly solid company with $3.8 billion in balance sheet cash. As an oil-field services company Schlumberger has seen its revenue plunge this year as explorers pull back and let some of their fields go into maintenance.

The company is one of the best in its industry with an advantage in drilling that’s hard to beat so there’s a very good chance this one survives and produces not only that dividend but a hefty price return as well. The dividend was cut 75% in June to protect cash flow but still pays that 3.3% yield and goes ex-dividend usually towards the beginning of the month.

How to Pick Dividend Stocks for Daily Payments

We’ve got ten more dividend stocks to highlight and stick with me because we’ve got the highest yields coming up.

I want to go through real quickly how I picked these stocks how I put the portfolio together so you can find your own dividend stocks or just adjust the portfolio when you need to.

Now the concept is easy but it took hours to put together the data on this. I took the 366 stocks in the S&P 500 that pay dividends nearly 400 large-cap companies I then went to the stock page for each one. You can find this on any investing platform but I went to Yahoo Finance and then to this Historical Data tab.

From here I changed the time period and then to Show Dividends Only to see the dividend dates for the last five years. I took that and copied it into my spreadsheet for every single stock noting the dividend dates over the last year.

Once I did that I could note when each dividend stock paid out on each day and then could pick the best for our portfolio. For example for today’s video there were 178 stocks going ex-dividend mid-November and into December.

This allowed me not only to create an income portfolio that pays out nearly every weekday of the month but also to select only the strongest companies with the highest dividend yields.

More Dividend Stocks You Can Count On

Prologis ticker PLD is in one of my favorite real estate types right now and pays a 2.25% dividend.

My Bow Tie Warriors out there you know I love real estate. Got my professional start there as a commercial property analyst and have my own rentals but some of the property types are looking UGLY this year!

Eight of the 12 REIT property sectors are posting losses this year with some getting absolutely smashed. Retail down 39% lodging is down 49% and office space is down 30% for 2020. But there are some sectors doing relatively well like industrial self-storage and data centers are booming.

And Prologis is a leader in that industrial space with 900 million square feet of logistics and warehouse property. Strength in the segment is being driven by ecommerce and the need for those distribution centers and it’s a great long-term trend to be in.

The dividend payment has increased by 45% over the last five years and usually goes ex-dividend mid-month December March June and September.

CBOE Global Markets ticker CBOE operates the options exchange in Chicago and pays a 2% dividend yield.

CBOE is one of the smaller exchanges that have yet to be consolidated into the larger companies but still operates the largest U.S. options exchange as well as a futures exchange. With the growth in retail stock trading this year I’m surprised shares haven’t done better and I like this one as a rebound play.

The dividend has nearly doubled growing 83% over the last five years and it’s a great cash-flow stock going ex-dividend late-month in November February May and August.

Another investor favorite on the list here with the 3M Company ticker MMM and its 3.5% dividend yield.

3M is one of the oldest companies on the list around since 1902 and one that has increased its dividend for an amazing 62-consecutive years.

The company operates in four segments; industrial transportation and electronics healthcare and consumer which gives it a breadth you probably won’t find anywhere else and helps protect that cash flow.

As big as it is the dividend growth surprised me here with 43% growth in the payment in the last five years along with a stable price return. Shares go ex-dividend mid-month in November February May and August.

Another in the financial sector this one in insurance with Prudential Financial ticker PRU and its 6.7% dividend.

Prudential is the second-largest life insurer in the U.S. with significant exposure in Japan as well. The entire industry has been hit on those low interest rates making it harder for insurers to earn a return on their cash reserves but management has released a plan to cut $500 million in costs to boost the bottom line.

Shares trade for a 30% discount on a price-to-book value trading for just 0.4-times the book value of assets and this one has grown the dividend by a solid 57% over the last five years.

Hey Nation while I’ve got you here can I ask a favor? If you’re on Instagram head on over after this video and join the Let’s Talk Money community. I’m sharing motivational quotes investing advice and a personal side I don’t get to show here on the channel so I hope I see you there.

Six more dividend stocks to round out the list and next is Waste Management ticker WM and its 1.9% dividend yield.

Now a 2% yield might not sound so great but this stock has produced an annualized 12.2% return on top of that yield over the last decade. It’s the largest solid waste services company in the U.S. with over 250 land fills and let’s face it probably one of the most stable business models there is.

The share price isn’t the only thing growing with the dividend up 42% over the last five years and one where you can count on future growth.

I highlighted Huntington Bancshares ticker HBAN recently as a favorite in the financials and its 6.3% dividend yield.

Huntington is another small regional bank with branches across eight states in the Midwest. The bank has doubled the amount in its loan loss provision account to over $1.7 billion and has still been able to consistently beat earnings expectations. It’s trading at a 35% discount to last year’s price-to-book multiple and if loan defaults aren’t as bad as feared could see a major earnings surprise.

Even with the slowdown over the past year the dividend has grown 114% over the last five years for a great yield on top of that price potential.

A little more of a safety pick here with PPL Corporation ticker PPL and its 6% dividend.

PPL is a regulated utility provider in Pennsylvania and Kentucky that recently announced plans to sell off its UK operations. That will take a lot of the uncertainty out of the business model and allow the company to focus on its U.S. operations. The move gives it more dividend stability and should also improve investor sentiment in the shares.

And that dividend uncertainty has played out with just a 10% dividend growth over the past five years the lowest in our group but I think you see it start rising from here.

Another agriculture play here with FMC Corporation ticker FMC and its 1.6% dividend yield.

Now another one with a relatively low dividend but an amazing total return producing a 12.6% annual price return over the last decade on top of that yield.

FMC is a pure-play crop chemical company and should benefit from that long-term trend to food demand and the need for higher crop yields. Shares are fairly valued here but it’s hard to argue with a 166% growth in the dividend over five years and that kind of long-term price return.

A little riskier bet in the real estate space is Ventas ticker VTR a healthcare REIT and its 4.3% dividend.

Ventas owns a portfolio of 1200 properties across medical office hospital and healthcare but concentrated in the senior living and skilled nursing niche. Most healthcare properties have been hit this year but most especially the senior care market but it looks like even this is turning more positive.

Occupancy hasn’t declined significantly and with a vaccine approval we should get better investor sentiment in names like Ventas. Shares are down 41% from last year’s peak and the company did cut the dividend this year to protect cash flow but I think it can be a strong long-term investment.

Valero Energy ticker VLO offers our highest yield of the group with a dividend just under 10%.

One of the largest refinery operations in the U.S. with 14 facilities in North America and the U.K. the company is uniquely positioned to refine lower-quality crude and has been able to produce higher profit margins.

The refineries have been hit just like all energy companies but quality names like Valero will survive. The company also owns over 3100 miles of pipeline and other midstream assets that give it a transportation advantage.

Valero is one of the very few in the energy space to maintain its dividend this year and has nearly doubled it over the past five years.

November Dividends List

The 17 stocks in this months portfolio produce a dividend yield of 4.9% just slightly above the entire 56-stock portfolio with a 4.2% yield. That’s 56 dividend-paying companies in every sector with a yield more than double the overall market that is going to put cash in your pocket every single day!

Investing in Dividends is Safe and Steady

What is the one thing everybody wants?

Money.

Everybody wants some more money but not everyone is willing to work hard for it. What if you are someone who does not want to have to work for your money? Well you can just leave that up to the stock market! Stocks are a way of owning part of a company and owning something means having rights to some of what that business makes. When companies make money they have to decide what to do with it put it in the bank (savings) invest in new equipment (capital expenditures) or give it back to shareholders (dividends).

However most companies choose option number 3 giving dividends back! There are two types of dividends: cash dividends and stock dividends. Cash dividends are just that money! You will get a check in your mailbox or direct deposited into your account. The amount changes every quarter since it depends on how much the company made.

Dividends are one of the most important things when it comes to buying stocks. There are many different types of investors you can be but dividends should definitely make up a big part of your strategy. If you do not actually get money every time the company makes money then what good does it do? Well dividends are taxed less than regular income so if you want to keep more of your own money they allow for this! Not only this but it is very safe. When they give you that money it is real money in your bank account (or brokerage statement). If something bad happens to the stock market then there is no chance they will go bankrupt and stop paying out dividends.

There are many different types of dividends you can get: quarterly dividend special dividend variable dividend high yield dividend  etc. They have different rules for how often you get them or how much they are. A good company will usually payout a very high percentage of their earnings each year as cash dividends – usually 4-5%. You are probably thinking this sounds too good to be true and you would be right. There are a few things to keep in mind when investing in dividend paying stocks.

Dividends are one of the most important things when it comes to picking stocks they can make a huge difference over time! They allow companies to pay back investors for all their hard work while still having some left over for themselves. Plus they offer lower risk than normal investments because they do not fluctuate as much as the stock price does. However beware that dividends may decrease or stop completely if you invest in a company during a bad period. It is also very important for investors looking for these high yields to have a lot of research on their potential investments.

Real estate in the metaverse is selling like hot pockets and for crazy amounts of money. Accordingly to NonFungible.com  more than $300 million worth of non-fungible tokens ( NFTs ) were sold last week — almost a quarter of sales were forin The Sandbox metaverse.Source: NonFunglible.com’s weekly newsletterWhile The Sandbox is raking in the most sales individual plots withinare more expensive. All of the top 10 sales with the most expensive clocking in at $758250 were for digital land within Decentraland.Spending millions for land that doesn’t actually exist in the real world may not fit everyone’s appetite but crypto enthusiasts are hoping to get in on the ground floor before prices get even higher.US-based firm Republic Realm for instance told the Wall Street Journal that it spent a record $4.3 million for digital land within The Sandbox on November 30. Meanwhile The purchase broke the previous all-time-high held by Tokens.com which purchased land in Decentraland for a whopping $2.4 million last month for a prime patch of real estate within the platform’s Fashion Street district.Grayscale the largest digital assets investment company in the world pegs that the value of these virtual gaming worlds could grow from $180 billion in 2020 to $400 million by 2025 . Crypto exchanges like Binance and others have established digital headquarters within the metaverse where employees can meet and collaborate. The old-school video game giant Atari recently announced the Atari arcade where players within Decentraland can come in and play mini-games.Moreover even artists like SnoopDogg are getting in on the trend by hosting concerts within the metaverse — which is smart considering the restrictions and risks posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.According to the Swiss multinational investment bank UBS the metaverse is also having an impact on the consumer tech segment especially with Facebook expected to increase capital spending as it focuses on the metaverse.Metaverses or crypto virtual worlds are in the midst of creating a multi-million dollar market for creators and asset owners.

Here's Everything We Know,"Adam McKay's latest project Don't Look Up pokes fun at how the world may end one day. The Netflix original follows astronomy student Kate Dibiasky (Jennifer Lawrence) and her professor Dr. Randall Mindy (Leonardo DiCaprio) who discover a comet hurling straight toward Earth. With only six months until impact Kate and Dr. Mindy do all they can to gain the public's attention and warn them of the impending collision before it's too late.

Though the critics's consensus isn't too flattering we applaud Adam McKay and his ensemble of A-listers for their efforts and performances in the satirical narrative. Plus we really enjoy observing a wide variety of locations and Don't Look Up took us on a journey full of stunning visuals. If you're as curious as we are to discover the filming locations stick around as we explore them!

Where was 'Don't Look Up' filmed?

Initially Don't Look Up was set to begin filming in April 2020; however filming was delayed seven months due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Once filming began in mid-Nov. 2020 the cast and crew headed to Massachusetts. Chiefly most of the shoot took place in the capital city of Boston. A few notable locations include South Station the Museum of Fine Arts and Howl at the Moon Boston.

Moreover a section of the film takes place in New York City; rather than heading to the Big Apple for filming Don't Look Up transformed Downtown Boston into the Empire City. More specifically the Financial District in Boston is the stand-in for NYC — if you want to get even more specific Devonshire Street and Federal Street are the key Financial District areas in the film.

Per the Greater Boston Concierge Association's Twitter page the Fairmont Copley Plaza a luxurious four-star hotel stood in for The Buchanan in Washington D.C. Besides Boston Don't Look Up was also filmed in Weymouth. The ""Last Concert to Save the World"" scene — featuring Riley Bina (Ariana Grande) and DJ Chello (Kid Cudi) — was shot at the South Weymouth Naval Air Station. The Patriot Ledger said the former airfield stood in for the renowned Wembley Stadium.

Don't Look Up also shot the space shuttle launch scene with Colonel Benedict Drask (Ron Perlman) in Weymouth as well as the first post-credits scene but we won't spoil it for you. Other locations include Battleship Cove which was used for an incredible political rally scene that features President Jane Orlean (Meryl Streep) attempting to bring the nation together of the impending comet via a massive firework presentation.

The Plymouth County city of Brockton also served as a filming location. The Patriot Ledger noted that filming in Brockton took place atop the fast-food eatery Burger Crown located on Montello Street. Also a Twitter user reported that filming in Brockton also occurred at the Enterprise Building on Main Street.

A portion of filming also took place in Framingham mainly for the scene in which Kate Dr. Mindy and Yule (Timothée Chalamet) are driving on the traffic-free Massachusetts Turnpike. However The Cinemaholic stated that Lariviere Road and the Butterworth Park neighborhood are also filming locations.

A firefighter and EMT by trade the Dearborn Heights resident takes a different role come Christmas time; renting a U-Haul truck and filling it with thousands and thousands of dollars worth of toys which he and a small crew of volunteers spend Christmas Eve delivering to kids in need across the state.

“It has grown to include the entire state. We had gifts delivered across the Mackinac Bridge just a few hours ago” Isaacson told FOX 17 before making a stop in Grand Rapids.

One truck downstate another up north it has grown a lot since Isaacson started this effort in Albion as a 17-year-old in foster care.

“Christmas morning in foster care is not the best so I took two checks I worked part-time at Taco Bell went to the Dollar General behind the Taco Bell and got whatever I could and got the neighbor next door to give me a lift over to the homeless shelter” explained Isaacson. The rest is history.

When FOX 17 met up with Isaacson Friday he was well on his way to delivering gifts to more than 200 kids across that state. Checking his list not once but twice for the names of children who need it most.

“We have self-nominations we look at news stories throughout the year. We'll have different organizations law enforcement agencies Salvation Army we have we take requests from many different sources. And then we comb through to find which families are the worst of the worst” Isaacson explained.

“The families here are families that all the kids are under the age of 10 years old. So they believe in Santa Claus and they have no other ways to get anything for Christmas this year.""

He knows firsthand what that is like so there’s nothing else he’d rather be doing on the holiday. “I mean come on now. I mean how cool is it to be Santa Claus?” he asked.

Though Isaacson doesn't dress in red or have a white beard. He prefers tactical boots and being as unassuming as possible.

While his mission is to make sure no kid is empty-handed come Christmas even Kid Santa knows Christmas is not all about gifts so he’s also delivering an important holiday message as well.

“This Christmas I want you to think about the things that you do have versus the things that you don't have. Instead of making a list of things that you want this year maybe make a list of things that you have things that you're grateful for because you have no idea just how truly lucky you are on Christmas morning.”

Issacson will finish the deliveries in his city of Dearborn Heights right around sunrise Christmas Day.

He also wants to continue growing his operation in the years to come to help his effort click here.

While many stores had extended hours in the days leading up to Christmas Eve the majority will close early Friday.

For the second holiday shopping season of the pandemic retailers started rolling out deals early to spread out demand. This year consumers were encouraged to also start early because of supply chain constraints.

Those ongoing constraints might be one reason more people will shop in-stores or take advantage of curbside pickup or on-demand delivery.

More people are also off from work. While Christmas Eve is not a federal holiday many businesses and federal offices are recognizing it as a day off because Christmas falls on a Saturday. The stock market is closed Friday.

While you’re celebrating the holiday you may be looking for some last-minute gifts for family and friends or you may need to stock up on supplies at a Dollar Store near you. Are Dollar Stores open on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day including Dollar General Family Dollar and Dollar Tree? The answer varies depending on the store.

Dollar Tree on Christmas Eve & Day 2021

Although Dollar Tree locations have sometimes been open on Christmas in the past that’s not the case this year. This year stores will be closed on Christmas and open for varying hours on Christmas Eve.

A representative told Heavy about Christmas Eve hours: “The hours will vary depending on the location. Stores that are open will typically operate abbreviated hours in order to accommodate our customers shopping for their last-minute needs.”

A representative also told Heavy that on Christmas all stores will be closed.

Since local hours can vary on Christmas Eve you should check with your local Dollar Tree to make sure it’s open before you go for a visit. Find your nearest store’s holiday hours and more information here.

Family Dollar on Christmas Eve & Day 2021

In the past Family Dollar stores were sometimes open on Christmas Day but that’s not the case this year. Family Dollar stores will be closed on Christmas Day but open on Christmas Eve with varying hours.

A representative told Heavy about Christmas Eve hours at Family Dollar: “The hours will vary depending on the location. Stores that are open will typically operate abbreviated hours in order to accommodate our customers shopping for their last-minute needs.”

But all stores will be closed on Christmas Day the representative confirmed.

You can find your local Family Dollar’s location and holiday hours here if you’re wanting to visit on Christmas Eve.

Dollar General on Christmas Eve & Day 2021

Dollar General stores are closed on Christmas Day but they’ll be open on Christmas Eve for last-minute shopping.

A Dollar General representative told Heavy that all stores will be open until 10 p.m. local time on Christmas Eve and all stores will be closed on Christmas Day. They’ll have normal operating hours for all other days including the day after Christmas.

Local store operating hours may be found on the store locator here.

A Dollar General representative also told Heavy about the following specials that will be in place for the Christmas holidays.

“This week’s last-minute holiday deals include buy one get one 50% off our Comfort Bay Fleece Throws and buy one get one 50% off any Holiday Candles. We also have a special on toys through Christmas Eve – save 25% when you spend $75 on toys in a single transaction” the representative shared.

In summary if you need to do any last-minute shopping at a Dollar store near you whether it’s a Dollar General Family Dollar or Dollar Tree store then you will want to do all of that shopping on Christmas Eve. All the dollar stores are planning on being closed for Christmas Day.

Well-ordered and expansive its parking lot already neatly paved and marked the construction site is well on its way to completion — but there is yet to be a confirmation of proposed stores and scheduled grand opening. The neighborhood buzz however is thick.

“It’s nice to see an injection of retail in Rosebank” noted Linda Baran president and CEO of the Staten Island Chamber of Commerce referencing the North Shore revitalization that has been ongoing just a few towns over. “There’s buildings and housing going up just a stone’s throw away in the Bay Street Corridor which should bring an influx of new residents. A plaza of stores on Tompkins Avenue will bring increased options for those residents and that’s a good thing.”

Dubbed Tompkins Plaza and encompassing the addresses of 429 – 439 Tompkins Ave. the multiple-building project site is located directly across the street from the Garibaldi Meucci Museum and involves a decent sized parcel of land. The city Department of Buildings (DOB) noted that some permits for the site are incomplete and currently “disapproved” but there are active permits for at least three separate retail stores.

Already paved and landscaped Tompkins Plaza seems to be well on its way to completion. (Staten Island Advance/Jan Somma-Hammel)jan somma-hammel

And while the DOB does not require developers to provide information in their permit applications about the specific commercial tenant that will occupy a building a recent spate of real estate ads aimed at potential tenants suggests a Dollar Tree and Lidl grocery store will occupy the space. The German international discount retailer chain that operates over 11000 stores across Europe and the United States one of which is located in New Springville would not confirm however noting it was “too early to share specific details on this particular site.”

“We do look forward to continuing our expansion in New York and serving more communities in the future” noted Chandler Ebeier Lidl’s public relations rep.

Zoning diagrams show a food store is slated for Tompkins Plaza but there is no confirmation on which store is coming. (Staten Island Advance/Jan Somma-Hammel)jan somma-hammel

Structure Development Company a real estate developer based in Florida lists 435 Tompkins Ave. as part of its portfolio on its website noting that a four-story CubeSmart containing 856 self-storage units will occupy space there. And the national self-storage company which already has four locations on Staten Island is depicted in site renderings. CubeSmart however did not immediately respond to requests about confirmation of the new location.

The area is not devoid of shops and self-storage: Family Dollar Stop and Stor and American Self Storage all currently maintain active locations on the 300 block of Tompkins Avenue. There is also a Phil-Am Food Mart and Market Fresh Supermarket on a nearby stretch of the thoroughfare and Top Tomato and CVS are located about a block away on neighboring Bay Street.

“The area is not desolate by any means but I do think it could use a supermarket” Baran said. “When the Chamber did a needs assessment of St. George Tompkinsville and Stapleton that is something that came up. There are smaller markets in the area but increased access to fresh foods and other grocery products is always a plus. There seems to be lots of development happening in this corner of the borough right now. I think the introduction of new retail space in this section of the North Shore is definitely a bonus for area residents.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS9tb25leS9zaG9wcGluZy8yMDIxLzEyLzI0L2NocmlzdG1hcy1ldmUtb3Blbi1zdG9yZXMtaG91cnMvOTAwMDI2OTAwMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Open on Christmas Eve: Hours for Walmart Target Costco and more,"The last-minute shopping countdown has begun.

While many stores had extended hours in the days leading up to Christmas Eve the majority will close early Friday.

For the second holiday shopping season of the pandemic retailers started rolling out deals early to spread out demand. This year consumers were encouraged to also start early because of supply chain constraints.

Those ongoing constraints might be one reason more people will shop in-stores or take advantage of curbside pickup or on-demand delivery.

More people are also off from work. While Christmas Eve is not a federal holiday many businesses and federal offices are recognizing it as a day off because Christmas falls on a Saturday. The stock market is closed Friday.

This sentiment especially rings true for those in need of food clothing and gifts this time of year.

At the Columbia VA Health Care System (CVAHCS) there are hundreds of Veterans across the state who struggle with food insecurity a lack of adequate clothing and financial problems that leave them unable to provide a present-filled Christmas morning.

To meet the high demand for assistance CVAHCS’ community relations and engagement department relies heavily on community partnerships across the Midlands and Upstate. Despite the impact that COVID-19 continues to place on local communities CVAHCS’ partners ensured that their impact remained strong too.

“This time of year can be extremely challenging for several of our Veterans in our local communities” said CVAHCS Director/CEO David Omura. “The Columbia VA family is always grateful for the partnerships we have throughout the state and individuals and organizations large and small routinely step up during the holidays to help us make our Veterans feel special during the holidays.”

At this time of year the Dorn VA Medical Center (VAMC) typically welcomes a parade of more than 3000 motorcyclists delivering a plethora of gifts and donations to the medical center. However due to the ongoing pandemic the parade of motorcycles for the 21st annual Vet’s Christmas Charity Ride was cancelled but that did not stop the efforts of local businesses organizations and individuals to help the CVAHCS in providing local Veterans with a happy holiday season.

Retired Army Sergeant Major Jim Wertman co-founder of the charity ride says that he saw a great need to help military members and Veterans around the holiday times something that he experienced twice after being wounded during his time in service.

Even though there was no official charity ride Wertman still collected donations and on Dec. 12 the donations were transported to the Dorn VAMC campus to be catalogued and sorted before being gifted to Veterans in the community who were recommended by their social workers.

With the great amount of donations received over the past few months volunteers from Fort Jackson Soldier’s Angels Dominion Energy Disabled American Veterans and others visited the Dorn campus Dec. 13-15 to assist in the sorting and building of food baskets clothing bags and gifts.

“It’s always a great feeling when you’re able to help people in need” said Derrick Proctor a volunteer from Dominion Energy. “It’s a great thing to be able to help people and to be a part of the giving spirit.”

“Giving back to veterans is therapeutic for me” said Rovenia Jenkins Army Veteran and VA representative for Soldier’s Angels a non-profit charitable organization dedicated to assisting military members Veterans and their families. “It makes me emotional to be able to give back and to see and appreciate all of the donations that the community has provided.”

On Dec. 20 the CVAHCS received a donation of more than $10000 worth of toys from the Alpha Omega Phi (AOP) Military Fraternity and Sorority to be distributed to Veterans with children

“We believe that our Veterans need to be taken care of and that the community needs organizations to help push an effort to help one another” said Ken Thompson an Army Veteran and member of AOP. “Our purpose is to make sure the Veterans comes first. Knowing that we were able to supply toys to help our Veterans during these hard times is a blessing.”

To wrap up the season of giving CVAHCS received a visit from former University of South Carolina standout and NFL wide receiver Alshon Jeffery who visited the Dorn VAMC campus to donate funds to provide more than 70 hot meals and desserts to Veterans and their families who are enrolled in the CVAHCS’ Mental Health Intensive Case Management Program (MHICM).

“Mental health challenges find us all me included… In learning more about [the MHICM program] which host an annual Christmas luncheon but cannot meet this year due to COVID it was all I needed to hear” said Jeffery. “It is the least I could do given the thought of Veterans missing out not only on a hot meal but the comradery of Christmas. They are true heroes and often to are not seen nor heard and this is a small way to let them know that I hear and see them.”

In total the donations raised in the community allowed the CVAHCS and volunteers to assemble and distribute more than 400 baskets to Veterans and their families in the community.



The combination of the Vet’s Christmas Charity Ride the AOP Military Fraternity and Sorority Disabled American Veterans Soldiers’ Angels community donations the CVAHCS food pantry and thousands of volunteer hours helped ensure that hundreds of South Carolinian Veterans and their families received a warm holiday meal and a gift to open on Christmas morning.

“The holiday season can be very stressful for everyone. It’s heartwarming to help alleviate some of that stress on Veterans and their families by providing donations and letting them know that their selfless sacrifices are not forgotten” said Tammy Finney CVAHCS chief of community relations and engagement. “None of this would be possible without the year-round efforts and donations that we receive from our amazing community partners. Every single donation we receive makes a tremendous impact in the lives of our Veterans.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy51c2F0b2RheS5jb20vcGljdHVyZS1nYWxsZXJ5L3RyYXZlbC8xMGJlc3QvYXdhcmRzLzIwMjEvMTIvMjUvMTAtYm90YW5pY2FsLWdhcmRlbnMtYmVzdC1ob2xpZGF5LWxpZ2h0cy0yMDIxLzg5NzE2NjkwMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,10 botanical gardens with the best holiday lights in 2021,"READERS' CHOICE AWARDS Holidays Add Topic

That's because a fire destroyed the church's main worship space in September.

But Fort Johnson's parishioners understand that the spirit of Christmas isn't limited to a specific space. The joy and love that accompanies the holiday season can be manifested wherever believers come together.

After all this wasn't the first time Fort Johnson Baptist had seen devastation.

A spray-painted wooden sign was used to announce worship services days after Hurricane Hugo in 1989 toppled the church's steeple. The sign which had been stored above the church's ceiling reemerged after a portion of the overhead surface gave way during the September blaze.

""It's a good reminder that even after disaster good things can happen"" said Pastor Marty Middleton 43.

During the Christmas holiday season — one of the most important times of year for the Christian community — Fort Johnson finds itself attempting to preserve a sense of hope as the congregation continues grappling with the destruction of its house of worship. At the same time congregants are revisiting what it truly means to be a church inspired by an outpouring of support from the community and congregations that have faced similar challenges.

A message from the mess

A preschool student was the first to smell the smoke on Sept. 9 telling his mother ""it smells like a cookout out here."" The boy's mother a teacher at the church's preschool called emergency officials around 8:30 a.m. to report a fire at the church located at 1473 Camp Road.

Firefighters with the James Island Public Service District Fire Department and other area agencies were able to put out the blaze within an hour. Officials determined a lightning strike hit the steeple and caused the fire. The steeple fell during the blaze taking about half of the roof with it.",,,,,,

After almost two years of getting very intimate with the pros and cons of our spaces renters and homeowners alike seem to be finally starting to design for themselves rather than just for the potential resale value (or in some cases the ever-important security deposit). Instead of universally appealing white kitchen cabinets or neutral upholstery the most popular @dominomag Instagram posts in 2021 showcase designers putting a twist on a classic painting the exterior of a traditional farmhouse black and wallpapering a powder room in a bold citrus print.

These spaces’ innovative layouts and color combinations alone offer enough ideas to fill 10 houses but we were just looking to design one ultimate place. Here we’ve gathered our most-liked photos by room to build your 2022 dream home. Keep reading for a tour.

The Exterior

It’s clear that the dark exterior trend isn’t going anywhere quite yet because for the second year in a row your dream house is black. Megan and Dustin Moon’s modern farmhouse clad in fiber cement board siding is complete with massive windows flooding the Kalamazoo Michigan property with light at all times of the day.

The Hallway

The most important element to any mudroom is storage. This entry in Clinton Corners New York by designer Lori Paranjape features plenty of open shelving for jackets and bags and durable brick floors (original to the home) that can stand up to muddy footprints. “No one comes over and feels like they shouldn’t put a glass down because they’re going to ruin an antique” she points out.

The Kitchen

It’s all about the little innovative details in your kitchen of choice. The chic doggie door in this space in Atlanta designed by Sherry Hart and Ladisic Fine Homes is so much better than the usual plastic flap—and it blends right in with the rest of the steel-framed entrance.

The Living Room

The living room in Patricia Nogueira’s Bay Area rental looks warm and layered now but she moved in during the pandemic with just a few lamps and her bed. Everything else she sold in a socially distanced garage sale raking in an impressive $4000 to put toward the new pieces.

The Dining Room

This year you opted for the fresh white walls and cane furniture in Jessie Bloede’s Austin new build. (A far cry from 2020 when the favorite dining room was a pastel pink wonderland.) Low-key materials can pack just as big a punch in unusual silhouettes like the tiered rattan chandelier overhead.

The Main Bedroom

The best kinds of closets are also pretty to look at. Take a cue from the mint green and cane custom doors in model Zippora Seven and photographer Terence Connors’s Montauk New York cottage.

The Bathroom

Latham Thomas grew up in a traditional museum-like house—so she went for the total opposite vibe in her Brooklyn home. Case in point: the vibrant powder room. A statement citrus-print wallpaper with coordinating tangerine-colored mirror enamored you at first glance.

The Kids’ Room

Bunk beds can excite grown-ups too. Just ask Josh and Jenna who decked out their daughters’ space with a bespoke design featuring three beds (one is just out of view to the right) and sneaky drawers underneath.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vYWJjN2NoaWNhZ28uY29tL3Jlc3RhdXJhbnRzLW9wZW4tb24tY2hyaXN0bWFzLW5lYXItbWUtZm9vZC1kZWxpdmVyeS1yZXN0YXVyYW50LWhvdXJzLzExMzYyMjUxL9IBamh0dHBzOi8vYWJjN2NoaWNhZ28uY29tL2FtcC9yZXN0YXVyYW50cy1vcGVuLW9uLWNocmlzdG1hcy1uZWFyLW1lLWZvb2QtZGVsaXZlcnktcmVzdGF1cmFudC1ob3Vycy8xMTM2MjI1MS8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Restaurants open on Christmas Day 2021: Denny's IHOP and more,"Restaurants open on Christmas Day 2021

While Fundstrat's Tom Lee has bullish expectations for 2022 forecasting a return of at least 11% for the S&P 500 it's his long-term outlook that is especially eye-popping.

In a presentation to clients on Tuesday he outlined how millennials are set to fuel a decade-long bull market in stocks as America's most populous generation enters its peak earning years and begins to form families.

""The biggest reason to stay bullish is because of millennials"" Lee explained noting that stocks boomed when Baby Boomers and Generation X entered the age range of 30 to 50 years old.

He said the S&P 500 could surge to 19349 by 2029 representing potential upside of 313% from current levels. A surge to that level would translate to a compounded annual growth rate of 20% well above the stock market's historic average of between 7% and 10%.

Supporting Lee's bull thesis is the fact that many mega-cap companies today were founded by business leaders who were in their 30's at the time including Costco Home Depot Cisco and Oracle among others. Additionally US patent issuances tend to spike when the US sees a surge in its population of 30 to 50 year olds indicating that innovation is strong.

The millennial generation overtook Baby Boomers in population size around 2015 and the most populous age in America right now is about 31 years old.

Lee follows demographics because they tend to serve as a leading indicator in identifying potential tops and bottoms in the stock market. He noted the number of adults between the age of 30 and 50 years old fell until 2008 as the Great Recession took hold. That age group is set to accelerate until 2026 and the number of millennials in that range won't decelerate until the early 2030's according to Lee.

""Demographics of the US are turning into a tailwind right now...so we have this 14-year window ahead of us where we have a demographic tailwind...if this plays out we still have a very strong bull market ahead"" he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMS8xMi8yNC9idXNpbmVzcy9zZWxmcmlkZ2VzLWNlbnRyYWwtY2lnbmEtc2FsZS9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFJaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyMS8xMi8yNC9idXNpbmVzcy9zZWxmcmlkZ2VzLWNlbnRyYWwtY2lnbmEtc2FsZQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Selfridges sold to Thai and Austrian alliance in $5 billion deal,"Luxury British store chain Selfridges is being sold to a Thai retailer and an Austrian property company in a deal that a source close to the matter said was worth around £4 billion ($5.37 billion).

Thailand’s Central Group and Austrian real estate company Signa Group which already jointly own major department stores across Europe said on Thursday they had struck a deal for the chain best known for its Oxford Street store in London.

The Canadian wing of the billionaire Weston family bought Selfridges for nearly £600 million in 2003.

Central Group owned by the billionaire Chirathivat family and Austrian investor Rene Benko’s Signa together own department stores in Germany Italy Denmark and Switzerland.

Founded in 1908 the Selfridges Group employs 10000 people and owns 25 stores worldwide including in major cities in England Ireland the Netherlands and Canada.

Signa and Central will take over 18 of the 25 stores and hope to build a luxury hotel alongside the Oxford Street flagship the source said adding that seven department stores in Canada were not part of the package.

With Selfridges they hope to build a luxury department store empire complemented by an online business.

The source said they plan to increase sales to 8 billion euros ($9.1 billion) by 2024 - including more than 1 billion online - from around 5 billion now.

The conglomerate will be managed from a holding company in London with the potential for an eventual stock exchange listing although local management of the stores in other countries will remain the source said.

Central opened its first department store in 1956 growing to become Thailand’s largest mall owner with about 2400 retail stores. It has an e-commerce joint venture with China’s JD.com and stakes in Southeast Asia ride-hailer Grab Holdings .

Central has been present in Europe since 2011 when it bought the upmarket Italian department store chain La Rinascente SpA for 205 million euros. In 2013 it also acquired Illum Denmark’s oldest department store.

In 2015 Central bought a majority stake in three luxury department stores in Germany from Signa. Central and Signa last year together bought Swiss luxury store Globus and other assets for more than 1 billion Swiss francs ($1.1 billion).

Central and Signa have also teamed up with Japanese retail giant Aeon Co to develop an e-commerce platform for one of the fastest growing online sports retail markets in the world.

Benko made a name for himself as a property investor. He bought the iconic Chrysler Building in New York City in partnership with property firm RFR Holding LLC for about $150 million in 2019.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vdmlkZW9zL3RlY2gvMjAyMS8xMi8yNS9uYXNhLWphbWVzLXdlYmItc3BhY2UtdGVsZXNjb3BlLWxhdW5jaC1tYy1vcmlnLXNjbi5jbm7SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Watch James Webb Space Telescope lift off,"1.

Saunders

Reflecting on the past year in these last days of 2021 I’m reminded of the lines of a poem by Pam Brown: “On a most ordinary day something wonderful can happen. Out of the commonplace may come the sight of something remarkable. …These are no ordinary days.”

Indeed this has been no ordinary year for UWF. Record enrollment record gifts and national recognitions inspired us to reach for the remarkable.

January gave us the opportunity to distribute $10 million in funding to area businesses through our Industry Resilience and Diversification Fund with a goal of creating jobs in Northwest Florida. Our online programs were ranked among the best by U.S. News & World Report.

Sweet news in February showed UWF’s School of Nursing exceeded state and national averages for 2020 by wide margins as 95.97% of its graduates passed the National Council Licensure Examination - Registered Nurses on their first attempt. UWF surpassed the national average for first-time pass rate by over five percentage points and exceeded the state mark by nearly 10 points. And once again we were named a Gold-level Military Friendly School in the annual Military Friendly Schools list for 2021-2022 the only large public school in Florida to earn the gold distinction.

We continued our march in March toward the creation of Florida’s CyberCoast with the launch of CyberSuccess a program to prepare veterans for the cybersecurity workforce sponsored by Regions Foundation. Our gorgeous 1600-acre campus in Pensacola earned its second consecutive recognition by the Arbor Day Foundation as a Tree Campus Higher Education.

April showered us with gifts when our annual Day of Giving surpassed its goals with 1170 individual donors. MilitaryFriendly.com marked us as a Military Friendly Spouse School another nod to the fine work we do with all our military-affiliated students. Not to be left out for bringing home the gold our spirited cheerleading team captured a national championship at the NCA College Nationals.

It did my heart good in May to celebrate graduation in person again at the Spring 2021 commencement at Blue Wahoos Stadium where Sen. Doug Broxson gave a warm address to the graduates.

More recognition arrived in June when UWF led the state in highest percentage of bachelor’s graduates employed one year after graduation. Our Bachelor of Arts in Legal Studies program ranked No. 1 by Best Value Schools.

Summer outreach hit a peak in July when the UWF Center for Cybersecurity gave Cadette Girl Scouts a unique opportunity to earn three badges through one of its GenCyber summer camps. UWF joined other local organizations in partnering with Autism Pensacola Inc. to bring Sensory Street to downtown Historic Pensacola.

Florida’s SBDC network housed at UWF celebrated 45 years of service helping small businesses in August and the Chemistry Scholars program was awarded the 2021 Inspiring Programs in STEM Award from INSIGHT Into Diversity magazine. Later that month I traveled to Miami to join my friend President Madeline Pumariega of Miami Dade College in signing a partnership to enhance cybersecurity workforce development in the state.

You could feel the love in September when we announced a historic gift from the late Dr. Herman and Valerie Rolfs through their estate. The donation which created the Dr. Grier Williams School of Music and included an Imperial Bösendorfer piano is valued at over $8.5 million. As a result every music student and Argo Athletic Band member at UWF will have access to a scholarship.

We were again recognized as a Top Public School in the South by U.S. News & World Report and again named a “Great College to Work For.” A sixth national excellence in diversity award reinforced our efforts toward inclusion as a key factor of our success.

A virtual simulation system at the UWF Center for Behavior Analysis provided hands-on training for local law enforcement agencies and UWF’s Army ROTC cadets in October. The VirTra 300 LE firearms training simulator is a virtual reality system designed to incorporate applied behavior analysis to real-time situations.

We were truly thankful in November when three of our athletic programs football soccer and volleyball brought home conference championships raising UWF’s total to 103. The UWF Cyber Club placed in the top two in a regional competition outranking prestigious cyber programs from the University of Central Florida and Auburn University among others. UWF junior Ashton Reichard earned gold in the prestigious nationwide Japanese Learning Inspired Vision and Engagement Talk competition.

An early holiday gift in December came in the form of a $3 million National Security Agency grant to expand the National Cybersecurity Workforce Development Program. I was delighted to confer a degree to Taher Ragooy the first graduate of UWF’s doctoral program in intelligent systems and robotics. Ken Ford founder and CEO of our program partner Institute for Human & Machine Cognition was on hand to hood the recipient.

At year’s end the Florida Board of Governors voted to extend my contract and that made me very happy. It’s an honor to be your president.

Happy New Year!

""This is what kept me sane was my gift my connection with that"" said the 24-year-old. ""If it wasn't for that I would have taken myself out. I'm going to be honest because it was just that deep.""

Music provided Davis a lifeline as he was growing up in Pensacola. The church was how he started in music watching the drummer play at his grandmother's church when he was 4 years old. He later learned how to play the drums keyboard and organ and learned about music production. Always self-taught he learned to play instruments and about music theory from YouTube videos or by begging people to teach him.

Now he's ready to give back to the community and offer the same opportunities to children interested in music.

Next year with the help of his production company Peculiar Sounds LLC Davis will launch his Music Academy. The academy will teach children from ages 5 to 18 as well as adults different musical elements from instruments such as the keyboard drum and organ plus singing and music production.

""I just want to give these kids something positive. I can't really express that enough"" Davis said. ""I wish somebody would have been doing this when I was growing up.""

Now a chorus teacher at Pine Forest High School Davis said he has seen the talents of students both in his classroom and throughout the area and he wants to help students reach their full potential.

Davis said he has always wanted to be a teacher because he wants to empower children who grew up like him. He recalls watching his friend and mentor Micah Rowland a minister of music at Englewood Missionary Baptist Church conduct and coordinate the chorus. Davis had little knowledge of what Rowland was doing but wanted to emulate that same type of excellence which inspired him to be a chorus teacher.

Davis graduated from West Florida High School in 2016 and began to teach adults and children as young as 4 how to play piano and drums as well as leading vocal lessons. He also was a traveling musician and played for a band until October when he received an opportunity to teach at Pine Forest while studying for his bachelor's degree in education at Liberty University.

He said students whether in the classroom or music lessons need both love and encouragement but also direction which is what saved him. For example he recalled that when he earned bad grades in school as a child his mother took away his keyboard. That's when he knew he had to change his behavior.

That kind of direction — staying in the church having guidance and being surrounded by music — kept him sane and that's what he wants to bring to the academy.

""In this program there's a lot of guidance and I believe in helping kids"" Davis said. ""Sometimes they may not want to play something they may want to just sit there and just want to sit down and talk to you 'I want to express this' and 'Can you help me get back on the right track?'""

Davis plans to launch the academy by the end of January or early February.

Initially he plans to start small and offer a few programs but wants to eventually expand his offerings to include dancing and visual arts and has dreams of one day opening a school of arts.

""My goal is to show them that you can do this stuff despite what everyone has told you. You can do it"" Davis said. ""I'm going to help them unlock those different things. My goal is to unlock some stuff they didn't even know they could do and to pull out every gift possible.""

The price for membership not including taxes in the Peculiar Sounds Music Academy will be:

Ages 5 to 12: $15 to $20 a week or $75 a month

$15 to $20 a week or $75 a month Ages 12 to 18: $20 to $30 a week or $100 a month

$20 to $30 a week or $100 a month Adults: Prices coming soon.

There also is a yearly package and an equipment bundle. Classes will be offered in person or virtually depending on what students and parents find more comfortable.

Ladies and gentlemen

Good morning! Welcome you all to the annual ""Chinese Ambassador Scholarship"" online award ceremony.

Ladies and gentlemen

2021 is a special year for China. This year marks the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China (CPC). In November the Sixth Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee was successfully convened and adopted the Resolution on the Major Achievements and Historical Experience of the Party over the Past Century. Since its founding in 1921 the Party has made seeking happiness for the Chinese people and rejuvenation for the Chinese nation its mission. Over the past 100 years under the strong leadership of the CPC the Chinese people have won great victories in revolution construction reform and opening up and socialist construction with Chinese characteristics in the new era.

This year China has completely eradicated extreme poverty and we have lifted more than 770 million rural people out of extreme poverty over the past four decades. This is a great contribution to the global efforts in poverty reduction and a demonstration of the commitment of the CPC and our government to put the people at the center and to achieve common prosperity. China has thus completed the building of a moderately prosperous society in all respects and realized the first centenary dream of the nation.

Since the founding of PRC in 1949 China has successfully identified the right path of human rights development by giving priority to the realization of the right to subsistence and right to development and attaching importance to strengthening the rule of law. China emphasizes the ""development of people's democracy in the whole process"" as pointed out by General Secretary Xi Jinping also president of China when delivering an important speech at the celebration of the 100th anniversary of the founding of the CPC

This year while continuing to prevent and control COVID-19 pandemic at home China has strengthened international cooperation on fighting the pandemic and promoting Belt & Road cooperation. Last year China provided a large number of anti-epidemic materials such as masks PPEs and ventilators to 150 countries and 13 international organizations. Since the beginning of this year China has provided more than 2 billion doses of vaccines to more than 120 countries and international organizations. President Xi Jinping when addressing the General Debate of the 76th UN General Assembly put forward the Global Development Initiative (GDI) calling on the international community to speed up the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development promote a stronger greener and healthy global development and build a community with a shared future for global development.

This year also marks the start of China’s implementation of the 14th Five-Year Plan. China’s economic growth is expected to exceed 8% and reach 110 trillion yuan (equaling about 17 trillion US dollars). Our per capita GDP will reach 12000 US dollars. China has embarked on a new journey of marching towards the second centenary goal to build our country into a modernized socialist country in all respects by the time when we celebrate the 100th anniversary of the founding of PRC in 2049 and realize the dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.

2022 will be another important year for China. Beijing will host the Winter Olympic Games in February (the background plate for today’s event is one of the posters) and it will become the only city in the world to have hosted both the summer and winter Olympic games. The 20th National Congress of the CPC will be convened in the second half of 2022 and it will be a highly important event of great political significance for both the Party and the country.

Ladies and gentlemen

China and Africa and China and Liberia are good friends and brothers. The 8th ministerial conference of Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) held in Senegal in late November is a milestone for our cooperation in the new era. President Xi Jinping when addressing the opening ceremony of the Conference emphasized that the key for an everlasting spirit of China-Africa friendship and cooperation forged between the two sides lies in sincere friendship and equality win-win for mutual benefit and common development fairness and justice and progress with the times and openness and inclusiveness. He made four proposals for building a China-Africa community with a shared future in the new era which include fighting COVID-19 with solidarity deepening practical cooperation promoting green development and upholding equity and justice. He also announced that China will work closely with African countries to implement Nine Programs which include the medical and health program the poverty reduction and agricultural development program the trade promotion program the investment promotion program the digital innovation program the green development program the capacity building program the cultural and people-to-people exchange program and the peace and security program.

Over the years China and Liberia have worked closely to promote our friendly pragmatic cooperation with fruitful achievements in all areas to strengthen the strategic docking of the ""B&R Initiative"" advocated by President Xi Jinping with the ""Pro-Poor Agenda for Prosperity and Development"" (PAPD) advocated by President George Manneh Weah. People easily see many landmark projects in Monrovia such as the China-aided SKD Sports Complex the Ministerial Complex two annexes to the Capitol Building and the upgraded Roberts International Airport Terminal Project and outside of Monrovia such as the Tappita Hospital and University of Liberia Fendall Campus. Our cooperation in the agricultural area is making steady progress as demonstrated by the Agricultural Technical Demonstration Center located in Bong County and the Bamboo and Rattan Weaving and Vegetable Planting Technical Assistance Project in Monrovia. Since last year the Chinese government has provided four rounds of anti-epidemic materials which include many ventilators oxygen concentrators PPEs masks infrared thermometers among others. Please visit our embassy’s website (at: http://lr.china-embassy.org/eng) and check an article I have contributed to Liberian media titled The Outcome of China-Liberia Cooperation Is Widely Recognized for more details.

People-to-people exchange is one of the five important areas of B&R cooperation and education cooperation is an important platform. We are delighted to note that education cooperation between our two countries has achieved fruitful results in recent years. Over the years the Chinese government has provided hundreds of full government scholarships and many more long-term and short-term training programs some of which also offer degrees to Liberian youth.

This year the Chinese Embassy in Liberia has maintained close cooperation with the Liberian government through the Ministry of Education and relevant universities to overcome the impact of COVID-19 and continue to support your efforts on fostering of talents. I’m pleased to announce that this year 185 students from your three universities have been awarded with Chinese Ambassador Scholarship in a total amount of 23000 US dollars. This morning WFP is hosting an event together with the Ministry of Education and our embassy to hand over rations aided by the Chinese government with 2 million US dollars for more than 55000 students and their families for 2 months in Montserrado Nimba and Maryland counties. UNICEF is also implementing a nutrition and other necessity program aided by the Chinese government with one million US dollars for pregnant women and new-born babies in 15 counties.

Youth represent the future of a nation. Liberian young talents must give full play to their own advantages and maximize their wisdom to promote sound and rapid economic development of their country. In order to do so you should make up your mind and work hard to learn knowledge participate in social practice gain experience face difficulties squarely and adopt positive attitude towards society and life. At the same time you are expected to continue to inherit and carry forward the brotherly bond between the peoples of China and Liberia and contribute to the friendly relations and cooperation of our two countries.

Ladies and gentlemen

2021 is a year full of challenges. 2022 will a year full of hope. On behalf of the Chinese embassy and in my own name we wish to extend to you and your families our season’s greetings and best wishes for a happy and prosperous New Year!

Thank you all!",,,

SEEM builds on existing bilateral trading by establishing a new platform matching buyers and sellers of excess electricity. A third-party analysis estimated SEEM would save 50 million consumers more than $100 million annually by 2037 while boosting renewable energy and energy storage.

Fourteen utilities including Southern Company two Duke energy subsidiaries and the Tennessee Valley Authority submitted the proposal which became automatically effective Oct. 12 due to a 2-2 deadlock at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. On Dec. 13 FERC denied two rehearing requests from opponents of the proposal because they missed a Nov. 10 deadline.

Southern Company spokesman Todd Terrell said ""we are working to be ready in the second half of 2022"" for the SEEM initiative to go live.

Tyler Jubert a power market analyst at S&P Global Platts Analytics said the original proposal in February said the new market ""would reduce trade friction and promote the integration of renewables.""

""However the agreement still lacks an official plan on how an automated system matching buyers and sellers would operate; therefore it remains unclear how trade will be impacted as well as what the integration of renewables will look like"" Jubert said. ""Critics of the agreement have also pointed out a number of potential flaws such as a potential ... for SEEM participants to feel incentivized to maintain their monopoly power at the expense of the customer... and it remains unclear if any additional changes will be implemented at this point making it difficult to say how prices or new projects will be impacted.""

Eric Smith Tulane Energy Institute associate director said the project ""won't really be resolved"" until FERC's newest commissioner Willie Phillips has his say about it.

""When he does the decision will be whatever the leaders of the Democratic party and the Washington circuit [court] decide not the existing members of FERC and certainly not the ... members of the proposed quasi-market"" Smith said.

Smith said he thinks SEEM ""is merely an attempt to maintain the status quo by creating a rudimentary market with limited access and two classes of membership.""

""While [FERC Chairman Richard] Glick is correct in that it is a step forward it is not a very big step"" Smith said.

Forward price trends

Regardless of when and how SEEM is implemented forward traders appear to foresee weakening prices in the second half of 2022. As of Dec. 15 Into Southern and Florida on-peak power forwards for August through December 2022 were substantially lower than average monthly day-ahead on-peak indexes for the comparable months of 2021. For almost all previous months 2022 forwards were valued as higher than 2021's comparable monthly average dailies.

Natural gas forwards and spot indexes followed a similar pattern with most forwards for the second half of 2022 substantially lower than comparable spot numbers in 2021 but with most forwards substantially higher than comparable spot numbers in in the first half of the 2021.

Increased power supply in the region may play a role in lower power price expectations for 2022's second half.

Georgia Power's latest update on its two new Vogtle nuclear generators each with 1117 MW capacity indicates that Vogtle Unit 3 should go online in the third quarter of 2022 followed by Unit 4 in Q2 2023.

However Georgia Public Service Commission staff and independent construction monitors filed on Dec. 1 an estimate that Unit 3 will likely go online between December 2022 and February 2023.

Solar growth coal retirements

Solar is also slated to grow substantially in 2022 but that growth faces uncertainty around supply chain issues. S&P Global Market Intelligence data shows 3.3 GW of solar capacity under construction with 2022 commercial operation dates which would top the 2.7 GW added in 2021 and add to the 19.8 GW installed as of the end of 2020.

The largest solar capacity added in 2021 was 1104 MW in Florida but Georgia has 1146 MW under construction with 2022 planned in-service dates.

However supply constraints exacerbated by the recently dismissed petitions for relief from anti-dumping and countervailing duties on solar cells from Malaysia Thailand and Vietnam ""caused significant shipping disruptions for importers"" the Solar Energy Industry Association said Dec. 14.

Jamie Bach Tennessee Valley Authority Commercial Energy Solution manager said ""Next year we can expect headwinds in terms of commodity and supply chain pressures but remain committed to solar growth to meet increased customer demand.""

Coal retirements may constrain Southeastern US power supply in 2022 which might strengthen power prices. Platts Analytics data shows 3.6 GW of coal retirements across the region in 2022 focused on Georgia Tennessee Florida and Kentucky.

Platts Analytics' Jubert said nuclear and solar additions would more than offset ""coal retirements we anticipate through 2022 so the incremental access to supply would offer lower wholesale power prices as demand is expected to hold flat.""

""This is assuming the Vogtle plant is completed next year"" Jubert said. ""We typically go with what the company's latest proposed in-service date is. However if they are once again reporting further construction delays then that certainly puts a risk to the 3Q 2022 timeline.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdvb2RuZXdzbmV0d29yay5vcmcvd2luZC10dXJiaW5lcy11c2UtY2FtZXJhcy1hbmQtYWktdG8tc2F2ZS1iaXJkcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wind Turbines Are Using Cameras and AI to See Birds –And Shut Down When They Approach,"Wind power is a powerful tool for reducing carbon emissions that cause climate change. The turbines however can be a threat to birds and bats which is why experts are looking for—and finding—ways to eliminate the danger.

The US government has allocated $13.5 million to look for solutions. But already a Boulder Colorado company has produced a camera- and AI-based technology that can recognize eagles hawks and other raptors as they approach in enough time to pause turbines in their flight path.

Their tool called IdentiFlight can detect 5.62 times more bird flights than human observers alone and with an accuracy rate of 94 percent. https://www.identiflight.com/

Using high-precision optical sensors the system calculates a bird’s speed and flight trajectory and if it is on a collision path with a turbine a signal is sent to shut that turbine down.

Winning an award for its performance in Australia the tracking system was installed in 2018 at a Tasmanian facility and was found to cut eagle deaths at the Cattle Hill Wind Farm by more than four-fifths.

Each day signals have shut-down their movement an average of 400 times—across the field of 48 turbines—for two to three minutes each time.

Across the globe Duke Energy in Wyoming is employing the same technology with impressive results at its Top of the World Windpower Project.

The IdentiFlight network of camera units watch for bald and golden eagles. When a camera detects an approaching object the system determines whether it’s an eagle within seconds.

Top of the World—named for a ridge where golden eagles roost—was the first wind site to use the technology. In 2014 IdentiFlight’s manufacturer Boulder Imaging used Top of the World for testing after eagles fatalities left the company in violation of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act.

47 units made of eight wide-angle cameras now constantly scan the sky to monitor all 110 turbines. The camera unit is mounted to the top of a 30-foot pole and powered by software that learns and improves with each photo taken as ornithologists vet previously identified birds.

An independent study conducted in 2020 by The Peregrine Fund Western EcoSystems Technology and the US Geological Survey showed an 82 percent reduction in eagle deaths at the site which is located in Glenrock.

Bird lover and director of National Audubon Society’s Clean Energy Initiative Garry George admits “Our own science shows that climate change is by far the biggest threat to birds and the places wildlife need to survive.”

“IdentiFlight will make it possible to combat the worst effects of climate change and protect the birds we love in the process.”

Indeed a 2009 study using US and European data on bird deaths analyzed the number killed per unit of power generated by wind power vs fossil fuel and nuclear estimating that for every bird killed by a turbine nuclear and fossil fuel powered plants killed 2118.

Eagles have been capable of adapting too. Some of the raptors living at Top of the World have been on the site for years and have had no issues avoiding the blades.

Duke Energy announced it is installing IdentiFlight at Frontier Windpower II in Oklahoma and Wyoming’s Campbell Hill site.

Bitop Coptis On Nov. 10 Spate co-founder Yarden Horwitz moderated a presentation which featured talks from Nagase Applechem and McKinley Resources . She said a newfound sophistication in the beauty space is emerging among consumers who are seeking relief from various skin conditions such as hyperpigmentation and psoriasis. There is also increasing demand for retinol in an effort to achieve radiant skin.

Manette Epright technical manager at Nagase  explained autophagy or cell degradation of unnecessary or dysfunctional cellular components and touched on Professor Yoshinori Ohsumi’s Nobel Prize-winning discoveries of mechanisms for autophagy. Nagase’s ExtremOsio Novel Skincare Solution safely activates autophagy and naturally promotes skin beautification with its containment of Trehalose loaded liposomes. Trehalose is a natural non-reducing disaccharide commonly existing in plants and organisms with cytoprotection through proteome stabilization.

An accumulation of high intracellular levels of Trehalose she said enables organisms to survive in severe conditions. In an in-vitro study Extremosio was shown to significantly protect keratinocytes from UV-induced damage reducing wrinkles improving hydration and color homogeneity in a 45-day study involving 10 Caucasian women who averaged 44 years old who applied a cream containing 5% Extremosio twice daily.

Anne Schrotter global sales and marketing manager Bitop said there’s been an uptick in skin irritation from inflammation in the form of “angry” red rashes and clusters of papules around the nose and mouth from facial coverings. She cited comments Adam Friedman a professor of dermatology at the George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences who blamed the increase on the pandemic. She also cited the widespread use of home offices which result in additional screen time with Zoom meetings and other increased virtual interactions. Consumers obviously don’t like what they see.

Given these findings consumers are seeking skin care products in the form of meaningful beauty that are safe and sustainable per data from Sonar in addition to blue light protection and a mindful minimalist approach to finding them: a quarter of British women have reduced the number of facial skin care products according to a 2020 study by Mintel

Extoin Natural  Bitop’s latest innovation is scientifically proven to shield skin from blue light damage and can also be used on babies to treat eczema.

Extremolytes or stress protection molecules are highly adapted bacteria. The so-called extremophilic microorganisms she said produce special stress protection molecules to adapt to their hostile habitats.

Ectoin Natural protects these extremophilic beings from harmful environmental influences.

On Nov. 11 a Clean and Natural Beauty Panel was presented by the New York Society of Cosmetic Chemists’ Advisory Committee and hosted by chair-elect Dr. Giorgio Dell’Acqua

Fast/Easy/Clean Formulating with pH-Responsive Thickening Surfactant Systems

Severine Jeulin director of new product development personal care Ele Corporation said “responsible is the new clean” and spoke about self-thickening surfactant concentrates using surfactant blends which she said brings additional benefits to further streamline the manufacturing process.

“The future of cleansing products will be water- and plastic-free” she said adding that there is a dramatic reduction in water consumption and plastic waste on the horizon.

Benefits of concentrates she said include the speed of formulating less trials and testing; the speed of production (fewer ingredients to add); product stability; smaller chemical inventory; reduced cost; and less documentation.

For formulators interested in obtaining a better understanding of how pH-controlled viscosity works she explained that in a mixed micelle containing anionic and amphoteric surfactants as the pH is lowered the amphoteric surfactant begins losing some of its negative charge going from a net neutral species to a cationic molecule. This leads to a dramatic decrease in the repulsion between the headgroups in the micelle resulting in an increase in the packing parameter and corresponding increase in viscosity.

Green and Clean Retinoids



Anne Schrotter global sales and marketing manager Bitop Anne Schrotter global sales and marketing manager Bitop Marcie Natale global market development at Eastman Chemical Company  lectured on the rise in demand for retinoids in the past five years.

Retinoid usage in formulations have been used from 1996 to 2015. Retinol and retinyl palmitate are the primary retinoids used in the personal care from category introduction until 2015. Retinol accounts for 13% and retinyl palmitate 87% of the total retinoid usage with 1295 products a year.

There are many challenges in derivatizing retinol. These include manufacturing and temperature and atmospheric conditions which can degrade reactants color and byproducts.

Natale noted that retinol is unstable during traditional manufacturing and can be very challenging to manipulate during an industrial reaction at high temperatures and non-optimal atmospheric conditions. A traditional esterification of retinol can degrade the retinol and potentially produce unwanted by-products and additional color.

“Retinol is UV and oxidatively unstable which means if you are a formulator or working in manufacturing you have to handle retinol very carefully to ensure that it doesn’t degrade during production. In formulation retinol must remain oxidatively stable at the time of consumer purchase” explained Natale.

Eastman GEM Retinyl Sunflowerate is a naturally-derived pro-retinol composed of retinol and sunflower fatty acids. It is biobased formulation stable easy-to-handle and a nonirritating antiaging ingredient. It is free of solvent diluents and carriers. Cosmetic uses include lips eyes and face.

Its companion Eastman GEM Retinyl Linoleate is composed of linoleic acid from safflower oil.

Scientifically-Based Natural Preservation for Clean Beauty

Israel Weisser head of sales and marketing for Sharon Laboratories  discussed preservation trends and clean beauty claims. He said consumers are willing to pay more for safety and transparency. Lower contamination risk conditions pH of formulation outside the range of 3 to 10 alcohol content greater than 20% and closed packaging (aerosols airless containers) are less likely in natural formulations. The following are possible in natural formulations: water activity of a formulation less than 0.75 and very high levels of essential oils.

Twenty-five to 30% of European Union young consumers show interest in waterless products. These include facial cleansing bars dry shampoos and non-rinse conditions. A high-efficacy solution is SharoSense Plus 181 with natural and natural-like preservation systems is pending a patent. Components include natural maltol plant-derived polyquatemium-80.

Natural and Synthetic Ingredients in Beauty – Efficacy safety and sustainability

Dr. Nitasha Buldeo founder Organic Apoteke  spoke about natural versus synthetic ingredients. Approximately 25-30% of the personal care and cosmetics market is comprised of natural ingredients while 70-75% are synthetic ingredients.

“Buzzwords are aimed at convincing consumers of the advantages of natural over synthetic ingredients and often devalue synthetic ingredients but these buzzwords often cause consumer confusion” she said.

Polymers are a class of cosmetic raw materials essential in the production of high-performance products. They are classified as synthetic semi-synthetic or natural. Synthetic and semi synthetic polymers can be tailored for specific applications are cheaper than natural polymers can be produced on a large scale with uniformity and have a long shelf life. They also have thermal and chemo sensitive properties enable nanoparticle delivery modify fragrance release and reduce the risk of evaporation.

Natural polymers in cosmetics are biocompatible with skin safer eco-friendly in character highly attractive and marketable to consumers. Chemicals in cosmetics can interact with one another and with other chemical compounds on the skin. Due to reaction with body enzymes which result in beneficial or detrimental effects pre-formulation analysis and testing is paramount to ensure the safety of the selected ingredients in cosmetic formulations.

According to data from Grandview Research the US organic personal care ingredients market size by product – which started at $2.04 billion in 2016 is expected to post steady gains through 2027 with natural surfactants emollients active ingredients sugar polymers and natural preservatives among the star ingredients.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Beverage marketing gurus of the world have been noticing the rise of the non-alcoholic drink market growing beyond the usual catchment of designated drivers recovering alcoholics and pregnant women.

“Today’s consumer is saying that they can drink alcohol but they just don’t want to” Dave Deuser told Forbes in October.

Deuser is the CEO of sales at German brewing giant Radeberger. The company is launching the first non-alcoholic beer of its 150-year history in January.

As non-drinkers are growing beyond a tiny niche market beverage producers are providing consumers with an ever-expanding range of options. Retailers are stocking their shelves.

For years non-drinkers were stuck with pop cans sparkling apple juices and sketchy “near beers.” Beverage designers have now mastered the 0.0 per cent alcohol lookalike crafting distilled beverages some packaged like luxe high-end liquor with prices to match.

Everything from imported and craft beers boasting 0.0 per cent to distilled botanicals (not to be drank neat) are on Whitehorse shelves. Some of these distilled botanicals are made from seeds and nuts spiced and balanced for high tones and low tones with the same care accorded fine perfumes and whiskies.

At Riverside Grocery in downtown Whitehorse one will find strong-looking cans of Sober Carpenter (0.3 per cent alcohol) Crazy D’s Sparkling Prebiotic and tall bottles of Vyne in the drink cooler. Lower down cans of new mocktails under the brand Sparkmouth.

At the very back of the store in the juice section you’ll find Clever Distilled Gin Lumuette spirits and Curious Elixirs sitting beside the vegan Ceasar mix.

The Yukon Liquor Corporation is even offering to special order bottles for your private selection and Yukon Cocktail & Bar Supplies on 2nd Avenue will have all the tools and implements to stir things up.

Takes all types to make a market

Many credit the pandemic with the rise in sobriety but others recognize that the “sober-curious” movement had legs long before 2020. Tired of hangovers and regrets even the non-addicted started recommending drink substitutions and trial periods of abstinence.

The trend developed more steam thanks to COVID-19. Finding themselves drinking more some people paused and began experimenting with not drinking to see how life feels without the party lubricant. Many began for a short time and found they are feeling happier and healthier without their usual evening beers or party-harder weekends.

“I wasn’t an alcoholic I just thought I would quit for a year and see what happened” George a Yukoner who asked to be identified only by his first name told the News.

“I felt so much better and was exercising and I lost weight. Then I decided I would just not drink for another year.”

That was three years ago.

“What I didn’t expect was the hard time I got from my friends thinking there was something wrong with me that I didn’t have a beer when we went out for a drink” he said.

Another woman expressed a similar sentiment.

“I quit for a bit over the summer and felt great. I wanted to keep going but there is just so much alcohol up here — it’s everywhere. I couldn’t keep it going.”

Another woman a recovered alcoholic expressed disdain at the Yukon’s preoccupation with liquor and disregard for non-alcoholic options—bars without mocktails and hosts with nothing but soda cans pulled out from the back of the fridge as an afterthought.

“Give me a virgin mojito any day. It’s really good drink but only two bars in town offer it. I love mocktails” she said. “I didn’t stop drinking to stay home.”

Making not drinking normal

Emma Eaton a manager at Yukon’s mental wellness and substance use services says its important “not to push people” to have a drink over the holidays.

It’s important to offer a wide range of drink options right from the very start and not to pry as to why someone doesn’t drink she said.

Eaton says it is important for people who don’t drink to feel included and still feel part of an extended family or group of friends. One way to do this is to give them the same kind of glass but with a non-alcoholic drink it.

“People who are not drinking don’t want to feel singled out” Eaton said.

Christmas can trigger memories of past holidays gone terribly wrong disappointments and embarrassments. For those in early recovery it can be a hard time to socialize and to know when and where to not socialize.

It’s important to give people in early recovery enough space to make a phone call leave or whatever they may need to stay comfortable and sober during the holidays she explained.

Eaton also challenged people to be creative and design holiday activities around something other than drinking – board games or outdoor activities. She also thought people might have alcohol-free gatherings to stay healthy or honour the sobriety of people who may be in recovery.

The goal “is to make not drinking seem just as normal as drinking” she said.

A horrific Christmas murder unsolved for almost three decades has seen a fresh appeal from a lead detective.

Twenty-seven years have passed since Nechells mum Tracey Mertens was found badly burned in a Cheshire churchyard.

Police say the mother-of-two was kidnapped from her old Cattells Grove home on December 23 and bundled into a yellow Ford Escort.

Tracey was only briefly visiting her former Birmingham address having then moved to Rochdale to collect a benefits book from the property.

Her kidnappers later doused the blindfolded 31-year-old in petrol before brutally setting her alight and leaving her to die on the steps of a church.

The former dinner lady's screams of terror were heard by a passer-by who rushed to her aid.

Her clothes despite freezing temperatures were still piping hot from the petrol the burns so horrifying her aid thought Tracey was wearing a costume.

Brave Tracey lived for several hours following the harrowing attack fighting for her life in hospital where she was able to give detectives some information about her abduction.

Sadly however she lost her battle for life on Christmas Eve 1994. Doctors were unable to save the mum who had burns over 95 per cent of her body.

Cheshire Police say Tracey described her killers as two black men around 30-years-old 'big and fat' with 'Jamaican accents'.

Tracey told police she heard the pair speak in a foreign language before the terrible crime.

Despite best efforts and thousands of interviews detectives have never been able to charge anyone with Tracey's murder.

A £30000 reward for information leading to a conviction currently sits on ice.

Leading the case Detective Inspector Kate Tomlinson said: ""Tracey met a violent and horrific death at the hands of her killers.

""She was so brave and told detectives as much as she could before she died. That information was vital for the investigation team at the time and numerous lines of enquiry were pursued.

""Over the years we have renewed our appeal and a number of people have come forward with information - I would like to thank them for their assistance. However despite extensive enquiries nobody has ever been charged with Tracey’s murder.

“Therefore as Tracey’s family prepares to spend another Christmas Day without her I would personally appeal to anyone who has any information about Tracey’s death to get in touch – even the smallest amount of information can be crucial when piecing together a case.

""I appreciate that it is a long time ago but I am sure that if you witnessed something you would still remember this now. I would urge anyone with any information to come forward and help us with our investigation.""

Long before the start of the seemingly never-ending pandemic it was hard to resist the convenience of online shopping. But while buying something directly from a reputable retailer—or straight from the manufacturer—tends to ensure that you know exactly what you’re getting the rise in popularity of online marketplaces particularly those on Amazon and Facebook has made it more of a crapshoot.

These spaces operate more like virtual flea markets—except without the option of inspecting the items (in person) yourself. For this and other reasons it’s not uncommon for stolen goods to end up for sale on these sites. In fact according to the National Retail Federation what it refers to as “organized retail crime” (ORC) currently costs retailers an average of $700000 per $1 billion in sales and roughly 75% of retailers surveyed in 2020 saw an increase in ORC that year alone.

So how do you tell what’s legitimately (and legally) being sold or resold and what’s hot? Here are a few red flags to look out for when shopping at online marketplaces.

A bizarrely low price

When an item is priced way way below market value or “discounted so heavily” that it looks suspicious then it’s a sign that it might be stolen retired Beverly Hills Assistant Police Chief Marc Coopwood told Newsnation Now. If you’re not sure how much it typically goes for Scambusters recommends checking prices of similar items that have already been sold. You can do this on eBay by clicking “sold listings” in the left-hand panel of the product listings page.

A sparse or suspicious listing

Take a careful look at the listing of the item you’re considering to see if it has any of these red flags Scambusters advises:

There’s no real description of an item—only a brief plain statement of what it is with no details.

The description claims the item was “found.”

It’s a locked computer tablet or smartphone and the seller claims they “forgot” the password.

If you do decide to pursue the item further before making an offer be sure to contact the seller and ask plenty of questions on things like its condition how long they’ve owned it and why they’re selling Scambusters explains. Ask sellers to show you proof of ownership like a receipt or product registration record.

An anonymous profile

While there’s no guarantee that online sellers are who they say they are Coopwood says that having an anonymous profile is also a definite red flag.

A lack or absence of ratings and/or feedback

Of course there are always cases in which a new (and completely legit) seller doesn’t have any ratings or feedback yet but as a general rule that’s not a great sign. So is only having negative ratings or having feedback only for a handful of very cheap items—a tactic Scambusters says crooks use to build up their (fake) credibility.

There is no way to contact the seller

Usually reputable sellers will provide at least some way to contact them if buyers have questions or issues. But Coopwood says that this isn’t the case for people who sell stolen merchandise.

The seller asks you for personal information

According to Coopwood this happens most often when sellers don’t provide any identifying information about themselves. “[When] they have an anonymous profile they are asking for information you should never give them” he told Newsnation Now.

The seller requests that you pay via money transfer

It is a major red flag if a seller asks you to pay for your purchase with an untraceable money wire or a cashier’s check and won’t accept credit cards or PayPal according to Scambusters.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vbWljcm9zb2Z0LXN0b3JlLWJlc3Qtc2hvcHBpbmctYXBwcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The 5 Best Shopping Apps on the Microsoft Store,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vbWljcm9zb2Z0LXN0b3JlLWJlc3Qtc2hvcHBpbmctYXBwcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL2JhY2stdG8tdGhlLWZ1dHVyZS1yZXBsaWNhLWJhc2VkLW9uLW1hcnR5LW1jZmx5cy10cnVjay1sb29rcy1sZWdpdC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This 'Back To The Future' Replica Based On Marty McFly's Truck Looks Legit,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL2JhY2stdG8tdGhlLWZ1dHVyZS1yZXBsaWNhLWJhc2VkLW9uLW1hcnR5LW1jZmx5cy10cnVjay1sb29rcy1sZWdpdC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay9uZXdzL2FydGljbGUtMTAzNDE0ODMvSEgtc3RhbXBlZC1Ib3JzdC1IYW5lLTItY29pbnMtc29sZC1BdXN0cmFsaWFucy10aG91c2FuZHMtb25saW5lLmh0bWzSAXpodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlLTEwMzQxNDgzL2FtcC9ISC1zdGFtcGVkLUhvcnN0LUhhbmUtMi1jb2lucy1zb2xkLUF1c3RyYWxpYW5zLXRob3VzYW5kcy1vbmxpbmUuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,HH stamped Horst Hane $2 coins are being sold by Australians for thousands online,"Australians are encouraged to check their loose change after a $2 coin with a little known symbol is selling for thousands of dollars online.

The tiny 'HH' symbol can be found stamped on $2 coins minted in 1988 and 1989 (pictured)

An eBay auction listed the 1988 'HH' $2 coin asking for bids starting at a whopping $10000

Other auctions have the $2 pieces selling for $5 to $20 while another auction is selling the coin for $2000

Coin experts have long maintained the coins featuring the symbol are not worth more than $2 after 200 million coins were minted with the stamp.

But that hasn't deterred some Australians from seeking top dollar off their loose change.

One eBay auction listed the 1988 'HH' $2 coin asking for bids starting at a whopping $10000.

Other auctions have the $2 pieces selling for $5 to $20 while another auction is selling the coin for $2000.

However in a video uploaded to TikTok on Wednesday money expert Joel Kandiah has continued to remind people the coins are only worth $2.

'When people question you that the HH $2 coin is only worth $2 because they saw someone selling it online for $10000' he writes while shaking his head.

'190 million of these were minted. That's one in four $2 coins ever made! They will only ever be worth $2' he added.

However a bidding war has erupted over last year's $2 commemorative coins honouring Australia's firefighters.

Australians are encouraged to keep their eye out coins featuring the orange flame design on the wrong side.

The coin features two firefighters standing back to back with a vividly coloured flame superimposed on the centre of the design.

But a handful of the $2 coins have the fire design on the wrong side obscuring the Queen's head.

'Very few of them exist...so depending on quality they can be worth about $6000' according to Sydney coin expert David Jobson from Town Hall Collectables.",,,

ATV

That’s because licensing deals cost money and most vehicle manufacturers have already struck such deals with game studios that promote their products in a more direct manner – like with racing sims where the vehicles act as main protagonists instead of just tools for your character to get from checkpoint to checkpoint.Howeverand snowmobile-maker Polaris is playing a different game pun intended. They’ve recently announced a first-of-its-kind partnership with EA’s Battlefield 2042 video game  thus becoming the official off-road vehicle partner of the platform.This means that players can drive the Polaris Sportsman ATV within the gameplay of Battlefield 2042 as showcased in the video below.“At Polaris we are passionate about creating products that enable possibilities for work and play in the outdoors. Our partnership with Battlefield 2042 brings that real-life passion to a virtual world to help enhance the player’s experience and ability” said Holly Spaeth director Corporate Branding and Partnerships Polaris. “As gaming grows and diversifies this partnership allows us to reach new and existing audiences with an authentic brand experience.”This partnership between the American off-road firm and Electronic Arts arrives at a very lucrative time for both the powersports and gaming industries which are expected to see continued growth in the coming years. In fact the gaming industry is estimated to reach $200 billion by 2023 whereas the powersports segment projects eclipsing $25 billion by 2027.The Polaris Sportsman range is currently spearheaded by the Sportsman XP 1000 which has a starting MSRP of $14499 and the Sportsman XP 1000 S which will set you back upwards of $16599. The latter is considered by Polaris to be the industry’s most capable ATV.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiHGh0dHBzOi8vcmEuY28vZXZlbnRzLzE0OTAyMzHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Moct x Tbilisi Open Air at Ayrarat Armenia,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://ra.co/events/1490231 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiHGh0dHBzOi8vcmEuY28vZXZlbnRzLzE0OTAyMzHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,

Eli Lilly has gained significant market share across the GLP-1 and sodium-glucose transport protein-2 (SGLT-2) drug classes with Trulicity (dulaglutide) and Jardiance (empagliflozin) respectively. In head-to-head studies the company has proven that tirzepatide has superiority over its main competitor Novo Nordisk’s semaglutide. The dual agonist has also proven to be efficacious in tackling obesity and cardiovascular risk factors associated with T2D. As such it is likely to maintain Eli Lilly’s long-term dominance in the GLP-1 space after the patent expiry of Trulicity in 2027. Additionally the strong clinical data relating to obesity provides access to an entirely separate market and directly competes with Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy (semaglutide). Key opinion leaders (KOLs) interviewed by GlobalData have reported that they are keen to prescribe a therapy that can address levels of glycated hemoglobin and obesity.

In a head-to-head study between tirzepatide and semaglutide its likely main competitor tirzepatide’s estimated mean change from baseline in the level of glycated hemoglobin was -2.01% -2.24% and -2.3% with 5mg 10mg and 15mg doses respectively while semaglutide’s was -1.86%. The estimated differences between the 5mg 10mg and 15mg tirzepatide groups and the semaglutide group were −0.15 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI] −0.28 to −0.03; P=0.02) −0.39 percentage points (95% CI −0.51 to −0.26; P<0.001) and −0.45 percentage points (95% CI −0.57 to −0.32; P<0.001) respectively. The results demonstrate that tirzepatide at all doses is non-inferior and superior to semaglutide. Additionally the data for reductions in bodyweight demonstrate that they were greater with tirzepatide than with semaglutide (-1.9kg -3.6kg -5.5kg for all doses respectively; P<0.001). Another advantage for tirzepatide in comparison to other GLP-1s was that it had only mild adverse events which were primarily gastrointestinal.

In patients with T2D tirzpeatide was found to be noninferior and superior to semaglutide regarding the mean changes in the glycated hemoglobin levels. Because tirzepatide demonstrated this superiority it is likely to become a leading therapeutic in the GLP-1 space in addition to the wider T2D market. There is an increasing need for therapeutics that can address the additional comorbidities of T2D such as obesity and cardiovascular disease. The fact that tirzepatide addresses this need will likely increase its popularity with physicians. Obesity is closely associated with T2D and due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic a greater spotlight has been placed on therapeutics that can address weight reduction. Thus tirzepatide will likely achieve positive uptake as a result. GlobalData forecasts that tirzepatide will become a market leader in the GLP-1 space for both T2D and obesity and will likely overtake the market share of semaglutide toward the end of the decade.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld2luZGlhbmV4cHJlc3MuY29tL3dvcmxkLzIwMjEvRGVjLzI1L2V4cGxhaW5lci13aGF0LWNvdmlkLTE5LXRoZXJhcGllcy1jdXJyZW50bHktYXJlLWF2YWlsYWJsZS1pbi11cy0yMzk5NDAxLmh0bWzSAYkBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmV3aW5kaWFuZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vYW1wL3N0b3J5L3dvcmxkLzIwMjEvRGVjLzI1L2V4cGxhaW5lci13aGF0LWNvdmlkLTE5LXRoZXJhcGllcy1jdXJyZW50bHktYXJlLWF2YWlsYWJsZS1pbi11cy0yMzk5NDAxLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,EXPLAINER | What COVID-19 therapies currently are available in US?,"World

Kar.) as per incuriam in “utter violation of Article 201 of the Constitution of Pakistan”.

All judicial and quasi-judicial proceedings need to adhere to certain basic norms of justice. One of the cardinal principles of such basic norms is that one cannot be a judge in his own cause. Section 122(5A) of the Ordinance as it stands now makes the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (CIR) a judge in his own cause as first of all he delegates all his powers to a taxation officer and once an order is made by him he may declare that the delegated officer applied the law incorrectly! What a mockery of ‘due process of law’ that in fact he is posing as judge in his own cause.

How can he declare his own orders [though passed by somebody else on his behalf as envisaged in section 211] as incorrect? This would certainly be a wanton breach of the basic norm of justice. This breach certainly amounts to infringing ‘the right of access to justice’ which is an inviolable fundamental right enshrined in Article 4 of the Constitution. This right is equally founded in the doctrine of ‘due process of law’—New Jubilee Insurance Company Limited Karachi v National Bank of Pakistan Karachi PLD 1999 SC 1126.

The ‘right of access to justice’ includes the right to be treated according to law the right to have a fair trial proper opportunity of being heard and the right to have a just and impartial court/tribunal/authority. The term due process of law as elaborated by the honourable apex court in the case of New Jubilee Insurance Company Ltd (supra) can be summarised as under:

a person shall have notice of the proceedings which affect his rights; he shall be given reasonable opportunity to defend; that the tribunal court of authority before which his rights are adjudicated is so appointed/constituted as to give reasonable assurance of its honesty and impartiality; and that it is a court/authority of competent jurisdiction.

These basic requirements of the doctrine of ‘due process of law’ are embodied inter alia in Articles 4 and 10A of the Constitution and are intrinsically linked with the right to have access to justice—a fundamental right. This right inter alia includes the right to have protection against abuse of powers. When the CIR under section 122(5A) assumes the role of a judge in his own cause any action under this provision of the Ordinance amounts to a manifest and blatant violation of the due process of law. Needless to say that this provision as it stands now is unconstitutional in view of Articles 4. 10A and 25 of the 1973 Constitution.

The moot question is about jurisdiction under section 122(5A) of the Ordinance that is pari materia or analogous to section 66A of repealed Income Tax Ordinance 1979 [hereinafter “the repealed Ordinance”] as held by the Apex Court in CIT v. Eli Lilly Pakistan (Pvt.) Ltd and other (2009) 100 TAX 81 (S.C. Pak.) as under:

“It may be observed that section 66A of the repealed Ordinance provided for revision of the assessment orders hence generally speaking it was pari materia not with section 122 but with section 122A of the Ordinance which provided for revision of the proceedings under the Ordinance. Subsection (5) is pari materia with section 65 of the repealed Ordinance inasmuch as the grounds earlier provided for additional assessment were made the grounds for amendment or further amendment under that subsection while section 66A of the repealed Ordinance qua grounds for revision is pari materia with subsection (5A)”

Harmonious interpretation not destroying the scheme provided by the Legislature is clear:

i) Return filed under Universal Self-Assessment Scheme becomes assessment order the moment it is filed without any conscious application of mind [section 120(1)].

ii) If any return under section 120 is not acceptable for any reason on actual or alleged basis causing loss of revenue section 120(1A) of the Ordinance authorizes the Commissioner to select the case for audit as recently held by this august Court in the CIR v. Messrs Allah Din Steel & Rolling Mills and others (2019) 119 TAX 27 (S.C. Pak.):

“In terms of section 177 of the Ordinance the Commissioner can call for the record or documents for conducting the audit of the tax affairs of a person provided he furnished reasons to do so.”

iii) If there is any error action under section 221 of the Ordinance can be taken after giving notice.

iv) As a result of table/regular audit assessment order can be passed as provided in section 177 or in case of non-compliance order can be passed under section 121 of the Ordinance.

v) The revisional jurisdiction can only be exercised after an order made by conscious application of mind is passed and which is erroneous as well as prejudicial to the interest of revenue. This principle has been laid down by honourable Lahore High Court in the Sandal Engineer (Pvt.) Ltd v. IAC (2001) 83 Tax 551 (H.C. Lah.) as under:

“As a rule revisional jurisdiction is never exercised by the same authority. The power to revise be it suo motu or on the application or an aggrieved party necessarily involves the consideration of the impugned order by a person or authority placed higher in the hierarchy to adjudge its legality and propriety. The jurisdiction so conferred normally has a colour of supervisory power to correct mistakes on administrative side. Once an authority has passed an order it cannot act in revision on the same order to pick up faults and to interfere with by taking a different view of the issues involved. The power to revise an order is clearly distinguishable from review and rectification. Besides other things one common feature of them being that both review and rectification are normally made by the same authority which had earlier passed the order in question.”

Appeal against the above decision was dismissed by Supreme Court in CA No.1350 1351 & 1352 of 2001 dated 27.04.2006 as it was withdrawn by FBR.

As in the repealed Ordinance Legislature provides that only Additional Commissioner or Commissioner will exercise revisional jurisdiction under section 210(1A) of the Ordinance. If jurisdiction of a case is however assigned to an Officer of Inland Revenue below Grade-19 under section 209(2) only then can the revisional jurisdiction be directly exercised by Additional Commissioner as per section 210(1A) of the Ordinance. The department cannot invoke section 122(5A) as a routine similar to notice under section 62 of the Repealed Ordinance as it would negate the very purpose of revisional jurisdiction which can be exercised if there is order by an officer of Inland Revenue that is erroneous and prejudicial to the interest of revenue as the department has no remedy to file appeal against its own order.

A person cannot be judge in his own cause— the New Jubilee Insurance Company Ltd. Karachi v. National Bank of Pakistan Karachi [PLD 1999 SC 1126] so therefore after passing an order the same authority cannot revise it to that extent he/she becomes functus officio. There is nothing wrong in the Ordinance as far as revisional jurisdiction is concerned and the scheme prevalent in the repealed law has been retained as was the case in the repealed Ordinance. The department is therefore abusing it—contravening the law.

ENPH,Enphase,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJwcmVhbHR5cGx1cy5jb20vYWxsaWVkL2VucGhhc2UtZW5lcmd5LXBvd2Vycy1pbmRpcXViZXMtc29sYXItam91cm5leS0xMDM1MzQuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Enphase Energy Powers IndiQube's Solar Journey,Enphase Energy Inc. a global energy management technology company and the world’s leading supplier of microinverter-based solar-plus-storage systems today announced the commissioning of solar rooftop installation at IndiQube Lakeside. The 103 kWp solar rooftop installation by Enphase Energy India and U-Solar comprises 228 modules of Renewsys 450Wp panels and 228 Enphase IQ 7A microinverters. The generated solar power meets 25% of the total energy requirement of the property and offsets 140 tons of CO2 emissions in a year. This carbon footprint reduction is equivalent to planting 900 trees every year. Leveraging Enphase’s solar monitoring mobile app Enlighten IndiQube can track solar energy production and monitor the system’s health on a real time basis. IndiQube with a portfolio of 4 million square feet spread across 60+ properties in six cities is on a mission to provide sustainable workspaces that have environment health and safety at their heart. Today IndiQube is one of India’s preferred flexible workspace providers trusted by brands like Myntra Philips Hitachi Elanco Allegis Grant Thornton Ola UpGrad Unacademy and RedBus amongst many others. Enphase Energy offers the world’s most advanced solar microinverter technology which means higher production greater reliability and unmatched intelligence. Burst mode technology enables microinverters to produce more electricity even at dawn dusk and in low-light conditions for a longer solar day. Enphase IQ microinverters also include built-in rapid shutdown so in the event of an emergency solar power can be turned off instantly. Sunil Thamaran VP and MD at Enphase Energy India said “As employees gradually start going back to offices the energy consumption of office buildings is going to rise drastically. Shared workspaces will have to pre-empt energy requirements and explore ways to meet this rising demand. We are delighted to partner with IndiQube and convert their workspace into a green building. IndiQube has now moved on from just being an energy-efficient building to an energy-neutral building and we are proud to be a part of this green transition along with our partner U-Solar who installed the system on their rooftop.” Commenting on the development Rishi Das Cofounder & CEO at IndiQube says “We have a great association with Enphase from the time they have taken a fully managed office space at IndiQube Golf View Homes. This partnership takes our association a step further enhances IndiQube’s commitment to provide sustainable workspaces and augments our efforts to create an ecosystem of Green Buildings. We have plans to extend this collaboration to more properties thereby taking the overall rooftop solar power capacity to over 1 MW in 2022” Commenting on the solar installation Sanjeev Jha Head of Operations at U-Solar said “Companies are increasingly implementing more sustainable and eco-friendly practices and it is a trend that we expect will continue to grow. Organisations can install an affordable efficient and clean energy solution to power office requirements. The Enphase IQ microinverters ensure maximum solar power generation from solar panels enabling us to provide a smart solar solution for properties like IndiQube.”,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this round-up piece CosmeticsDesign-Europe looks back at our coverage on patents filed in 2021 and highlights some key areas industry is investing time and science in.

The future of ‘smart’ at-home beauty devices​

Beauty tech continued to advance fast in 2021 with many of the major brands investing plenty of research time and money in this space. An exciting field full of breakthrough consumer-led innovations personalisation and efficacy were undoubtedly driving this category.

. P&G ​Just this month Procter & Gamble (P&G) filed an international patent for a hair grooming device​ it had developed to analyse the time speed and force of a user brushing – collecting and storing data to communicate and guide consumers on personalised hair care needs.

. Beiersdorf ​In October Beiersdorf filed an international patent detailing an AI-driven method​ it had developed to profile skin based on moisture levels and geographical location. Via a mobile phone it provided an accurate picture of a consumer’s overall skin condition and enabled personalised product recommendations to be made by the brand according to real-time and evolving needs.

. L’Oréal ​In July L’Oréal filed its own international patent on a digital skin diagnosis system​ that analysed protein biomarkers to predict trends likely to be experienced by a consumer because of these also enabling customised formulations to be made along with more suitable product recommendations.

In February L’Oréal also filed an international patent on a smart skin treatment device​ that responded to voice cues from consumers and provided audio guidance during treatments to optimise the user experience. The device offered a range of cleansing and massaging options.

. Estée Lauder ​With more of a focus on efficacy in August Estée Lauder filed two international patents for two separate functional devices​ – one made with a reusable pump that simultaneously cooled and dispensed product and another single-use cosmetic pad with a self-heating function and preloaded formulation. Both inventions it said improved shelf-life and product efficacy for consumers at home.

. Unilever ​In May Unilever also filed an international patent for a user-friendly teeth whitening kit​ that combined a film and light source to improve efficacy. The kit it said also simplified the process for consumers.

Next-generation active formulas with CBD and naturals ​

There was also a continued focus on active beauty innovation using upcoming alternative natural ingredients in skin care hair care and oral care. The goal? To take beauty up a level and offer consumers more benefits beyond aesthetics.

. Colgate-Palmolive ​In April Colgate-Palmolive filed three international patents on CBD oral care blends​ that integrated a cannabinoid – cannabidiol (CBD) – for antibacterial efficacy and anti-inflammatory action. The blends it said could be used to make a range of oral care products including toothpaste mouthwash oral gels mouth spray and even chewing gum.

The personal care major also filed an international patent on a CBD antiperspirant blend​ it said offered anti-irritant properties for the skin.

. Unilever ​In November Unilever also filed an international patent on a metal-free antiperspirant blend​ made without traditional metal-based actives like aluminium instead using film forming polymers solvents and plasticizers as an alternative. The blend it said could be used to make stick or gel roll-on antiperspirant products.

Earlier that year in March Unilever also filed a patent for a zinc salt toothpaste​ that it said lowered blood pressure via enhanced nitrate reductase activity. The company said findings had been backed by a six-week clinical study.

. L’Oréal ​In September L’Oréal filed an international patent for curly hair styling formula​ made using sugar compounds and plant fibres offering a natural and light-weight alternative to polymer and silicone products that it said were often sticky on application and dried stiff. The formulation it said offered durable styling shaping benefits curl definition improved shine and frizz control.

. Beiersdorf ​In January Beiersdorf filed three international patents on a collection of alternative UV filter blends​ it had developed for use in cosmetic applications and sunscreens that addressed stability and nano particle concerns. The blends it said could be used in a range of formulas including ointments creams low-viscosity lotions sprays and even integrated into plasters or cloths as an impregnation medium.

Circular sustainable and beautiful packaging​

Industry also continued to innovate in alternative packaging materials with a focus on circular opportunities in post-consumer waste - a challenging space particularly for premium beauty.

. Unilever ​In August Unilever filed an international patent on a sustainable black coloured packaging​ made from layered post-consumer resin materials that would previously have been treated as waste. The invention it said offered an acceptable colour for premium beauty products – the biggest challenge when using post-consumer materials.

In October the European Patent Office (EPO) released a study​ outlining that cosmetics and detergents were the two categories innovating ""most intensely"" in bioplastic technologies worldwide with Europe and the US leading the charge.",,,,,,,,,,,,

As a child former UNC student Hailey Geer frequently visited her grandparents’ house where they had a wire flower sculpture on their coffee table. The intricacy of the sculpture always intrigued her and she hoped to one day recreate it.

Geer finally decided to try her hand at wire art when she was 14 but found it much more difficult than she had imagined. She started out making jewelry gradually working her way up to 3D wire art and sculptures.

In 2016 Geer created Fully Alive Wire Art selling her work on Etsy. However business didn’t immediately take off.

“It wasn’t until COVID that something just clicked and I started selling a ton more” she said.

She began receiving more commissions and growing her Instagram account to promote her work refining her skills along the way.

“I’m entirely self-taught – most of my learning has come from commissions” Geer said. “In the beginning I would accept almost every commission I got which forced me to learn and grow.”

Never one to shy away from a challenge Geer took an unconventional approach to the learning process. She tackled many complex difficult projects early on. In fact one of her first pieces was a turtle sculpture that took nearly 35 hours to complete.

“I started off really complicated with all these aspirations” Geer said. “I’m such a perfectionist that these projects took me so long but I made it work.”

In addition to sculptures Geer also makes jewelry bookmarks and wall art. Some of her most popular products include ballerina figurines copper chickadees and leaf bookmarks.

While Geer receives all kinds of different commissions the most meaningful ones to create have always been memorials. Many customers have reached out to her looking to recreate images of pets and loved ones who have passed.

“The ability to help people with their grief is definitely one of the most meaningful things I can do” Geer said. “Who would have thought that through Etsy I’d be able to connect with people from all over the world in such a meaningful way.”

Over the years Geer’s business has grown tremendously. Some of her bookmarks are now being sold at local coffee shops and she’s currently working on an elaborate fairy figurine that she expects to be displayed at an art gallery. Though she doesn’t foresee wire art ever becoming a full-time job she hopes to pass her craft onto others and eventually grow her team.

EG,Everest Re,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcnNndWlkZS5jb20uYXUvY2FyLW5ld3MvMjAyMi1mb3JkLWV2ZXJlc3Qtd2hhdC13ZS1rbm93LXNvLWZhci1hYm91dC10aGUtdG95b3RhLWxhbmRjcnVpc2VyLXByYWRvLWlzdXp1LW11LXgtcml2YWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2022 Ford Everest: What we know so far about the Toyota LandCruiser Prado Isuzu MU-X rival including engines ...,"After a rather lengthy teaser campaign Ford finally ripped the covers from its new-generation Ranger ute in November.

Ford has kept plenty of Ranger details under wraps for now but the key information Ford has revealed – aided by some further digging by the CarsGuide team – helps paint a much clearer picture of what to expect from its SUV fraternal twin the new-gen Everest.

The new Everest will have to contend with the wildly popular Toyota LandCruiser 300 Series and Prado as well as the Nissan Patrol the fresh Isuzu MU-X the Mitsubishi Pajero Sport Toyota Fortuner and more. Read on to find out what we know so far.

Platform

Underpinning the new-generation Everest will unsurprisingly be a variation of the T6.2 modular platform that forms the basis of the new Ranger. This is not all-new but rather a heavily revised version of the T6 architecture of the outgoing Ranger.

The Ranger and Everest aren’t the only models to use this platform. Ford’s reborn Bronco off-roader is another T6.2 model although it is only being produced in left-hand drive configuration so it’s a no go for Australia.

Given the changes to the platform have stretched the Ranger wheelbase by 50mm expect the next Everest to grow from its current 2850mm. That will likely mean it will have a slightly longer wheelbase than the LandCruiser 300 Series which matches the current Everest’s.

Other changes to the Ranger that should follow across to the new Everest include a more advanced four-wheel drive system and a modified suspension set up that allows more room for spring/damper articulation and improved ride and handling. It is expected to still be offered in both rear- and four-wheel drive guise.

A version of the turbo-diesel from the Ford F-150 will be used to power higher grades of the Everest.

Engines

Ford has confirmed that it will retire the 3.2-litre five-cylinder turbo-diesel engine used in the Ranger for the new model. That means it will almost certainly be dropped from the next Everest line-up too.

It is retaining the 2.0-litre twin-turbo diesel unit introduced in 2018 albeit with updates including major revisions to the 10-speed automatic transmission. Final outputs for the new Ranger haven’t been revealed but they should stay around the current model’s 157kW/500Nm.

Expect entry level versions of the new Everest to come with the 2.0-litre twin-turbo diesel as standard while higher grades will mimic the Ranger range by being offered with the new 3.0-litre turbocharged V6 diesel.

The Power Stroke V6 first surfaced in the US-market F-150 truck in 2018 but the version we will see in Australia has been completely revised for the Ranger and Everest.

Given Ford's push towards electrification there's all likelihood that a hybrid or plug-in hybrid version will also surface at some point after the launch.

The C-clamp lights from the F-150 Maverick and new Ranger should find their way onto the Everest.

Design

If you’re a fan of the new Ranger’s exterior design then you’re in luck. Ford is maintaining its twin design strategy for the new Everest meaning like the current model the new version will have much the same face as the Ranger.

As our render shows the new Everest will lose the rounded front and rear of the outgoing model and adopt a sharper boxier look and squarer silhouette. The Everest will feature Ford’s ‘C-clamp’ headlight design found on the Ranger as well as the F-150 and smaller Maverick ute.

As it’s an evolution of the original body we're expecting the Everest will carry over some parts and panels from the current model but Ford won't confirm anything at this time.

Images released by Ford of a camouflaged Everest undergoing final testing show that the sharper more squared-off look will carry through to the rear of the vehicle. The pics also reveal an interesting new tail-light cluster.

Finally the stretched wheelbase should help make the next-generation version look bigger than the current Everest and could even sit higher off the ground depending on what wheels Ford uses.

The new Everest will benefit from refinements made to the 2022 Ranger cabin.

Refinement

The Everest is an SUV based on a ladder frame ute and it’s not quite as refined as some other large SUVs that use a monocoque body so there’s definitely room to improve.

The expected improvements to the Ranger’s noise vibration and harshness levels should carry over to the Everest which in turn should give it a quieter cabin and smoother ride. It's likely to be less truck like than before.

While he wouldn’t reveal too much Ford Australia president and CEO Andrew Birkic hinted that the improvements to overall refinement rolled out for the Ranger will also find their way to Everest.

“I am super impressed with what the team has done on Everest. We’ll keep that up our sleeve. You’ve seen what we’ve done on Ranger. While we are not complacent on Ranger we are certainly not complacent on Everest” he told CarsGuide at the Ranger reveal in November.

The Everest and most Ranger models for Australia will continue to be sourced from Ford’s Thailand factory although some (as-yet undisclosed) grades of the latter as well as its Volkswagen Amarok twin will come from a newly-refurbished facility in South Africa starting next year.

Ford's Sync4 multimedia system will roll out in the next Everest.

Interior

The new Ranger’s completely redesigned interior represents a huge step up over the outgoing model.

New premium materials thoughtful storage touches appealing design elements a new heating and ventilation system and a focus on driver and passenger comfort will carry over to the new Everest.

Tech gets a big upgrade too with the new Everest expected to mimic the Ranger by offering configurable digital instrument and the built-in portrait style touchscreen available in 10.1-inch or 12.0-inch sizes housing the latest SYNC4 multimedia setup.

Like the outgoing Everest the new version should be offered with either five or seven seats and the third row will likely fold into the boot floor like the current model. It’s unclear whether it will have extra cargo space over the current model which is 876 litres with the third row folded and 249L with the third row raised.

It is rumoured that one of the outgoing version's biggest packaging bugbears – third-row seating egress – will be addressed thanks to an exiting system rethink. Let's hope that comes to fruition.

The design of the new Everest will be more squared off than the current model.

Pricing

Currently the Everest starts from $50090 before on-road costs for the Ambiente RWD 3.2L auto and it tops out at $73190 for the 2.0L 4WD Titanium.

Given the expected price bump for the new Ranger there’s every chance pricing for the next Everest will also creep up.

It has a bunch of new technology and improvements to safety and refinement and that usually means price hikes with any new-generation models.

That said while the Everest should still undercut the Toyota Prado which is priced from $60830 to $87807 don’t be surprised by a higher pricetag than the current model. And the introduction of the all-new 3.0L V6 turbo-diesel option will add further upward pricing pressure too.

Timing

Ford is expected to reveal the Everest in the second quarter of next year ahead of sales starting in Australia later next year or even in early 2023 if any more global production hiccups come into play.

It was just horrendous',"THE FOLLOWING PASSAGE is an extract from ‘This is Your Everest’.

AFTER THE WIN against Western Province the boys hit the town arriving at a Mexican place called Cantina Tequila for a proper booze-up. Gregor Townsend remembers it well.

‘Keith Wood’s got the girl who’s got the tequila he’s lying on the ground – now you couldn’t do it nowadays because everyone would be taking photos of it. You’d be in the tabloids you’d be destroyed. There was one night we got warned – remember Loaded magazine?

‘We had a meeting to say that a Loaded journalist was coming out with a photographer so we had to make sure we didn’t do anything silly. There was a group of us came back probably at like two in the morning after the Western Province game and this journalist and photographer from Loaded were sitting in the reception.

‘We were lucky that nothing happened — there was no story for them. I remember reading the article in the next month’s magazine and it was mainly about Lions supporters and South Africa and had some interviews with players but they were obviously waiting to trip someone up with a scandalous story.’

Barry Williams: Social media is the fucking killer for everyone. Every sportsman. You could be innocently having a chat with someone and the next thing you see so-and-so is in the paper. It’s spoiling things. That ’97 tour was the crossover tour before things got stupid before they were selling rights for everything and they wanted their pound of flesh.

Rob Howley: As a player you’re very mindful that drinking alcohol affects your ability to train but there’s a balancing act because you need to get to know the other players. Especially as a nine – it’s really important that you get to know your forwards because you’re the one shouting and screaming at them in the game. Sometimes the language you use on the field is different to what you’d use in the bar. You have to be honest and direct. Having a beer with them and getting to know them socially accelerates the friendship and makes it easier for you to bark orders at them on the pitch.

Dai Young: After every game we all went out together and had a couple of beers and a meal and a lot of the times it would be where the supporters were as well which was great. It was a fantastic atmosphere and you realised pretty quickly how important it was and how many people were out there. You can easily become trapped in a bubble and not realise how important it is outside of that.

Alan Tait: Geech had thrown me in at twelve against Province because Gibbsy was injured and on the night out in that Mexican place Dai and Gibbsy were having a few beers and Dai called me over and he says ‘You’ve just got Gibbsy his ticket home after that performance.’ I’d played well.

Gibbsy was pretty down because he’d done his ankle in and Dai had no sympathy at all. He said ‘That’s your ticket now Scotty boy. They’re going to be flying you home after Taity’s performance.’ And I could see Gibbsy’s face and honest to God he was absolutely broken. I said ‘Hey Gibbsy come on man you’ll be alright pal.’

He went ‘Oh God you reckon they’ll send me home?’ and Dai was just rubbing it in and rubbing it in. I said to Gibbsy ‘Look mate don’t be ridiculous. I’m not a twelve. I won’t be playing twelve in the Test matches. I’m telling you: you’re the twelve so get your head on.’

It was a position I could play but I wasn’t comfortable there – certainly not for a Test match for the Lions. I was a thirteen or even a winger but twelve was kind of strange to me. Gibbsy was clearly going to be the man. He just needed to get his ankle right and the coaches were going to give him every opportunity to do that but it’s bloody funny looking back on the way Dai was winding him up. No mercy at all.

The following morning bleary-eyed and dying from hangovers the Lions flew to Pretoria. The newspapers were full of reports of the spat between Bentley and Small including Small’s allegation that his opposite number had gouged him during Saturday’s game.

Fran Cotton addressed it at the next press conference. ‘We’re here to talk about rugby not massage James Small’s ego. As far as we’re concerned the allegation is nonsense. I suspect the motivation is really to deflect the attention away from the fact that he had a pretty average game and Bentley put two tries past him.’

Small responded by saying ‘It annoys me that people are always prepared to judge my actions without knowing the full story. What he did was not in the rules. He fingered me in the eye when I was defenceless.’

John Bentley: It was a total fabrication.

Ian McGeechan: It was an accusation that we treated with the contempt it deserved.

Fran Cotton: The whole thing was totally unnecessary. Small was a very good player but he was obviously into the psychology bit too. He wanted to unsettle us and get some payback after John had got the better of him.

John Bentley: The South African management seemed to find it all a bit embarrassing. Carel du Plessis said ‘At this level you have to be able to stay in control and James allowed himself to be weak.’ The South African rugby union decided not to cite me so they obviously believed my side of the story.

Ian McGeechan: We had to move on quickly from the incident – and Jim didn’t hang around. We’d scrummed poorly against Western Province and Jim was furious – which was bad news for the forwards.

Jim Telfer had reached the end of his tether right enough. He gathered his players together and gave it to them straight. He thought they were docile against Western Province – ‘tiptoeing through everything’ as he put it.

He felt some were either in the comfort zone or were knocking on the door of the comfort zone. It was time for him to send them a reminder of what they were going to be dealing with down the line and how tough they were going to have to be in order to meet what was coming their way. Captured for posterity by the film crew it was another classic Telfer address.

‘There are two types of rugby players boys’ he said. ‘There’s honest ones and there’s the rest. The honest player gets up in the morning looks himself in the fucking mirror and sets his standard sets his stall out and says: “I’m going to get better I’m going to get better I’m going to get better.” He doesnae complain about the food or the beds or the referees or all these sorts of things. They’re just peripheral things that weak players are always complaining about. The dishonest player.

‘If I tell a player he’s too high or he’s no’ tight enough – he’s too fucking high he’s not tight enough and that’s it and I’m the judge and not the player. And we accept that. And we do something about it.

‘I’ve coached Lions teams before and we’ve complained and carped about this that and the next thing. And I liken it a bit to the British and Irish going abroad on holiday. The first thing they look for is a fucking English pub; the second thing they look for is a pint of Guinness and the third thing they look for is a fish and chip shop.

‘The only thing they accept is the sun. They don’t take on anything that’s good or decent or different abroad. If we do that we’re sunk. Because we don’t go back bitching we don’t go back carping: “Oh if we’d done this at Twickenham or the Arms Park or Lansdowne Road or Murrayfield . . .” No no these days are past. What’s accepted over there is not accepted over here. And it’s not accepted by us — me and you.

‘So from now on the page has turned. We’re on a new book. Different attitudes. We’re honest with ourselves. And in many respects in the forward play — and let’s be fucking honest — we’ve been second best. We can match them. But only if we get it right here [a finger rises to his head] — and right here [he points to his heart].

‘Two weeks. There’re battles all along the way. There’s a battle on Wednesday. There’s a battle on Saturday. There’s a battle next Wednesday and there’s a battle the following Saturday; there’s a battle the following Tuesday; until we’re fucking into the big arena. The one we were there on Saturday.

‘And by that time the fucking Lions have to make them fucking roar for us. Because they’ll be baying for blood. And let’s hope it’s fucking Springbok blood. We’re focused. From now on the kid gloves are off. It’s bare-knuckle fucking stuff. And only at the end of the day will the man who’s standing on his feet win the fucking battle.’

Keith Wood: I could probably recite you that whole speech right now more than twenty years later.

Tom Smith: Jim is very articulate and I think it’s his background as a teacher he’s a very good communicator and what he was saying to everybody was pretty stark: we weren’t going to succeed if we didn’t address this problem. I remember the intensity of that meeting: it was just deadly silence. You look at the forwards on that tour – you’ve got Jason Leonard Keith Wood Martin Johnson Lawrence Dallaglio – all guys that are vocal but there was just total silence as Jim spoke.

Rob Wainwright: The hairs on the back of your neck were standing up after that.

Martin Johnson: He was right. We’d been a distant second in the scrums.

Jim Telfer: The basic principle of what I was saying was that the players had to be honest with themselves. They had to look in the mirror and understand what was required. From now on we’d be taking no prisoners and we wouldn’t pick anyone who wasn’t prepared to work. We had to adapt to the conditions. No whinging; all positivity.

Keith Wood: I heard a lot of strange talk about Jim Telfer before I went on that tour. It was good to see it was all true. He drove us to the absolute edge of our ability and it was about weeding out any possible flaws in the squad so you were left with this team that had the mental toughness to get through the Test series.

I’ve said it before if we were on tour for another day we’d have killed him. We were all falling apart by the very end of it. We hit a level of effort and training that to be honest we weren’t fit enough for. We pushed ourselves beyond the limit. It was both technical and mental — and we loved it.

The Lions were preparing to play their fourth game on tour against the bruisers of Mpumalanga in midweek but first they were having a forwards training session that none of them will ever forget even if they live to be a hundred.

Ian McGeechan: It was forty scrums in forty-five minutes.

Matt Dawson: It was fifty or sixty.

Neil Back: A normal scrum session at club level would involve you doing four sets of three maybe at a push five sets of three on the machine. But we did twenty sets of three – so sixty scrums.

Keith Wood: We did forty-three scrums. These numbers etched on my brain. Forty-three scrums in forty minutes.

Gregor Townsend: That was the hundred-odd scrum session wasn’t it?

Graham Rowntree: Jim knew how to drive a pack. No bullshit; drive us hard; lots of physical contact. We were training hard and fast every day and then we did fifty scrums in that session. Fifty scrums! It may have even been sixty or more. It felt like two hundred.

Gregor Townsend: They got killed. It was just: scrum do some tackles come back and scrum get up and sprint to the posts do some mauling come back and scrum.

Tom Smith: Jim loved that machine it was his toy. It was a piece of torture equipment. They dug the stakes about a metre into the ground and the pads had hydraulics built in that Jim could control with a lever.

You’d hit the scrum and the pads would move under the pressure but because the machine itself was dug into the ground it wouldn’t move. Then Jim would pull on the lever the hydraulics would kick in and the pads would start to push back at you.

So you had the weight of your pack pushing from behind you and the hydraulics pushing from in front of you. And you had to hold hold hold – and then it was up and sprint sixty metres sprint back and on again and on again and on again.

Keith Wood: It was a stupid bit of kit actually because they had worked out that you can get up to two and a half tons of pressure across the front row’s neck in a scrum and so that’s what the hydraulics were built to do.

In a scrum you might have that pressure of two and a half tons – but not the entire time. Something always gives after a second or two. Either my opponent gives or I give – something happens someone goes up someone goes down.

Well a hydraulic machine doesn’t give and so our job was to hit the scrum and hold it for thirty seconds. And the only thing that could give was us because the machine was unrelenting. I put a disc out on that Lions tour. Actually I tore my groin as well which I think was exacerbated by our scrummaging sessions.

Paul Wallace: It was like a punishment. But what Jim was great at was getting the extra few per cent out of you. You thought you were doing everything you physically could but he would demand more – and you found that you could give it.

Jeremy Davidson: It was fucking horrible but he had our total buy-in.

Keith Wood: I remember Telfer’s line when we broke from the scrum which was: ‘Run as fast as you can and then accelerate.’ One of those lines of magic right? You just had to put yourself into another place mentally. It was just horrendous. You’d hit the machine the pressure would come on you’d bind as tight as you could you did everything you could and you went to another place. That was all it was just . . . It was horrible. It was white-hot and it was horrible.

But we learned that our well was pretty deep that is one thing for certain. So I don’t begrudge the session. I hated the machine but I don’t begrudge it at all. I think it’s a kind of mark of pride that we did that session.

Jim Telfer: That was the most concentrated session I ever did on a scrum machine. We probably did about 60 scrums in 30 minutes but not one player complained not one player bitched.

We actually had a lot of the press watching – they’d heard about this mammoth session we’d planned and had come to see it. It was designed to be as much a mental exercise as a physical one because I knew that we were moving into the toughest part of the provincial tour.

We were due to play against three of the most famous provinces in South Africa – Northern Transvaal Gauteng and the then top province Natal – in eight days. Fran Cotton called it ‘the Bermuda Triangle’ because any players who didn’t stand up there would disappear. I know I nearly broke them and I’m sure a few ended up a bit shorter. But they responded.

Martin Johnson: One of Jim’s main strengths was that he talked with complete conviction. He sometimes got so intense that he started frothing at the mouth. If a coach gets the tone wrong everyone can switch off. But with Jim everyone switched on and improved. And to be honest we needed to. The scrum wasn’t going well but after that we really went for it in the sessions. They became a lot more aggressive and very hard work.

Tom Smith: We needed to suffer as a team to bring us together. Sometimes there’s something to be said for just going through a collective experience like that to make everybody concentrate on what they need to do to fix any problems. And once you’ve been through an experience like that together you always have each other’s back. It binds you.

Jim Telfer: I was convinced that the key to success was the front row and I told the players that there was no way we would annihilate the Springbok pack – very few teams have ever done that in South Africa – but if we got parity we had a chance.

The point about that scrummaging session was that it could be regarded as money in the bank; those players involved now knew that they could reach that level again if necessary. A number of doubts will have been erased from their minds.

Richard Hill: You live people’s experiences. You live their pain and you live their joy when it’s over. You knew that the guys around you had the capacity levels for hard work. You knew that everybody that was there was prepared to go to the last breath because you’d seen it. You knew how far they could go and you also knew that if you weren’t putting it in you were letting them down. It was a session that still gives me nightmares but it was such an important moment in the tour.

Scott Gibbs: He knew what he wanted. He wanted them rucking two inches off the floor so the body height was very important. It sounds ridiculous but whether it was a broom handle or a cane he wanted the guys lower so they could create quicker ball and cause a bit of damage along the way. You’d watch them trampling on each other in training Jim bellowing away. It was brutal man.

Jeremy Davidson: Looking back and having gone into coaching myself you realise that Jim was a lot more astute than you would have given him credit for back in those days. You kind of thought of him as a bit of a grumbly growler kind of coach who got you motivated by shouting at you and intimidating you but there was a lot of method and thought behind what he did. Jim knew best.

The South Africans were just men mountains. No matter what team you came across you were looking up. You came to a lineout you were looking up at the guy opposite or you were looking at him and thinking ‘God he’s twice the width of me and twice the depth of me’.

Martin Johnson: My shoulder was giving me grief so I couldn’t train a hundred per cent. The session that morning was brutal and everyone worked very very hard doing everything Jim asked of them – but I felt a bit of a fake just sitting watching the lads while Jim shouted at them. I could see their legs getting tired I could see them going through the pain . . . and I was sitting there twiddling my thumbs. I hated it.

Sometimes you knew you had to rest and that was one of those days but it was difficult at the time because I wanted to be out there doing it. Not just because I was the captain but because I wanted to do it.

And one of this vehicle's biggest highlights is its boatload of storage.

Nobody expected the Jeep Grand Wagoneer to blow up in popularity when it debuted as a trim level for the original Wagoneer. It was an upscale version notable for its exterior woodgrain trim inspired by station wagons. Still even that couldn’t save it from extinction in the early ’90s.

Chrysler reintroduced the Grand Wagoneer as a Grand Cherokee model but it was met with a less-than-stellar reception. But its 2022 reincarnation as a full-size luxury SUV is much more appealing. And one of this vehicle’s biggest highlights is its boatload of storage.

But first: How much power are we talking?

Large SUVs need to carry plenty of cargo and passengers without feeling too slow so a potent powertrain is essential. The Jeep Grand Wagoneer looks good on paper with a 471-hp V8 paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission. It also comes with standard all-wheel drive and 10 inches of ground clearance.

It can traverse water up to two feet deep and offers an adaptive air suspension. On civilized roads it can drive smoother than many other Dodge relatives due to its independent rear suspension. However Car and Driver reports that the wonky steering and noticeable body roll don’t inspire driver confidence.

So how much luggage can the 2022 Jeep Grand Wagoneer carry?

Driving manners aside the 2022 Jeep Grand Wagoneer’s sheer size makes it more impressive than rivals. Measuring almost 18 feet long it’s larger than the Lincoln Navigator or Cadillac Escalade. It also boasts over 27 cubic feet of storage space behind the third row.

As any three-row SUV owner knows the last row is typically not adult-friendly. Trying to pile in a lot of cargo with every seat upright is also a challenge.

Autoblog put that to the test by throwing in two roller suitcases each measuring 26 inches long and 16 inches wide. Two smaller roller suitcases were piled on top each 24 inches long and 15 inches wide. The tester also threw in one small rolling suitcase and an overnight bag.

Once the Grand Wagoneer was loaded the liftgate shut with no extra pushing or luggage reorganizing needed. Even better there was still a decent amount of space for the driver to see the road when looking over their shoulder. Also there were still a few free inches on the load floor before meeting the scuff plate.

In addition Autoblog said the third row is incredibly spacious comfortably seating even taller adults. If you’d rather fold that row down you’ll gain access to 71 cubic feet of storage space. On top of all that the Jeep Grand Wagoneer also has a maximum towing capacity of 9860 pounds.

The only downside is that the liftgate doesn’t open as high as liftgates on similar SUVs. Plus the power liftgate button is inside rather than outside making it difficult to access when the cargo bay is full.

Other interesting features in the 2022 Jeep Grand Wagoneer

The 2022 Jeep Grand Wagoneer boasts one of the most advanced center stacks on the market. A 12-inch screen sits atop a 10-inch screen that controls the HVAC settings. Higher trims can have an additional touchscreen for the front passenger and a rear-seat entertainment system. Each back seat can be lowered and raised with the simple push of a button.

The Jeep Grand Wagoneer isn’t cheap ranging from $88440 to $104845 to start. Still it’s one of the better SUVs if you want luxury without sacrificing cargo space.",,,,,,,,,,,,

BAYTOWN Texas -- Firefighters extinguished a large fire at a Houston-area refinery that started early Thursday injuring four people.

The fire started about 1 a.m. at ExxonMobil's refinery in Baytown which is about 25 miles east of Houston. Everyone on-site has been accounted for said Rohan Davis the refinery's manager.

Three of the injured were taken to hospitals by helicopter and the fourth was taken by ambulance Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said. Three had minor flash burn injuries and the fourth had a broken leg Rachel Neutzler a spokeswoman for the Harris County fire marshal's office said.

Right after the fire started local residents reported hearing a ""boom"" that shook their windows and homes.

The cause of the fire was not known late Thursday. ExxonMobil said air quality monitoring has not revealed any problems. No evacuations or shelter-in-place orders were issued.

The refinery along the Houston Ship Channel is the second-largest refinery in the United States and has the capacity to process up to 584000 barrels of crude oil each day. It employs about 7000 people according to the company's website.

Official: Cuomo's touching not criminal

NEW YORK -- Former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo won't face criminal charges after a female state trooper said she felt ""completely violated"" by his unwanted touching at an event at Belmont Park in September 2019 a Long Island prosecutor said Thursday.

Acting Nassau County District Attorney Joyce Smith said in a statement that an investigation found the allegations against Cuomo ""credible deeply troubling but not criminal under New York law.""

Smith opened the investigation after details of the encounter appeared in Attorney General Letitia James' August report on sexual harassment allegations against Cuomo. The report chronicled accusations from 11 women and led to Cuomo's resignation from office though he has attacked the findings as biased and inaccurate.

According to the report the trooper said Cuomo ran the palm of his left hand across her abdomen to her belly button and then to her right hip where she kept her gun while she held a door open for him as he left an event at Belmont Park on Sept. 23 2019.

Cuomo's spokesperson Rich Azzopardi didn't directly address Smith's decision in a statement released Thursday.

""With each passing day it becomes more and more clear that the attorney general's report was the intersection of gross prosecutorial misconduct and an abuse of government power for political purposes"" Azzopardi said.

Remains of woman killed in '07 found

JACKSON Miss. -- Mississippi authorities say they have identified the remains of a woman found after following a tip from an inmate before his execution last month.

The woman has been identified as 40-year-old Felicia Cox who disappeared in 2007 said John Weddle who is the district attorney for several northern Mississippi counties. Her body was found on land that once belonged to her family in Pontotoc County Miss.

In Wednesday post on Facebook Weddle said authorities were able to identify Cox by matching her DNA with her daughter Amber Miskelly. Miskelly was 18 when her mother disappeared. He said authorities expect autopsy results within two weeks.

Cox's remains were discovered on Dec. 12 while following a tip from inmate David Neal Cox who on Nov. 17 became the first inmate executed in Mississippi in nine years for a separate killing.

Before his death he told his attorneys that he killed Felicia Cox in 2007 and provided detailed instructions on where investigators could find her remains Weddle announced earlier this month.

Discourse about EXXON Mobil’s oil recovery exploits offshore Guyana at the December 5th – 9th World Petroleum Congress in Houston Texas reportedly centred around the company’s “growing offshore developments and exploration efforts.” One report quotes the company’s Senior Vice President Mike Cousins as alluding to the “incredible numbers………over 10 billion oil equivalent barrels” recovered offshore Guyana “in ten years.”

S&P Global Platts is quoted as saying that the Liza Phase I which came on stream late in 2019 is still the only one of the company’s twenty one discoveries offshore Guyana that is producing up to this time yielding “about 120000 b/d of oil the maximum capacity of its floating production storage and offloading vessel” the report says.

The Liza Phase 2 development is slated to commence early next year while a third development Payara is expected to start in 2024 the Toronto-based Guyana Petroleum Digest says. Each of those is projected to produce 220000 barrels per day” S&P Global Platts says. These are expected to be followed in 2025 with the startup of the #Yellowtail the capacity of which is around 250000 b/d according to the report.

Already enjoying a ‘sky high’ profile in the global fossil fuel exploration and recovery sector Exxon Mobil is the lead operator of the Guyana block with a 45% stake in partnership with Hess with 30% and China’s CNOOC with 25%.

Platts is reportedly adamant that it is the extent of EXXON Mobil’s oil discovery success in Guyana’s Stabroek block that generated sustained industry interest in neighboring Suriname the line of argument being that the subsurface geology was likely to extend beyond national boundaries. It is EXXON Mobil’s first Suriname offshore discovery which the Guyana Petroleum Digest suggests has generated the interest of other oil companies including the likes of Chevron and Total Energies in the Suriname basin.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHA6Ly9jYXJpYmJlYW4ubG9vcG5ld3MuY29tL2NvbnRlbnQvZXh4b25tb2JpbC1zYXlzLTIwMjEtc2FmZS15ZWFyLWl0cy1vcGVyYXRpb25zLWd1eWFuYdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ExxonMobil says 2021 a “safe” year for its operations in Guyana | Loop Caribbean News,"ExxonMobil Guyana says 2021 has been a safe year for the oil company noting that there had been many days across offshore operations without a recordable safety incident.

“The crew onboard the Liza Destiny FPSO for instance has reached more than 800 days without a recordable incident” said ExxonMobil Guyana Alistair Routledge.

“It is a value for us that people are looked after and that the workplace is safe. We take care of one another” he added noting the company’s commitment to “Nobody Gets Hurt”.

There are six drillships and two floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) vessels in the Stabroek Block offshore Guyana which are supported by more than 1000 people at any given time and Routledge regarded 2021 as an outstanding year for ExxonMobil Guyana despite the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic.

“We have been able to overcome operational issues and deliver on volume targets including five cargoes to the Government of Guyana. We’ve also continued our wonderful exploration success. Again people tend to forget that this is a frontier exploration acreage and we shouldn’t expect the kind of success we’ve seen” Routledge said.

ExxonMobil Guyana recorded multiple discoveries in the Stabroek Block in 2021 which increased the recoverable resource estimate to approximately 10 billion oil-equivalent barrels. Earlier challenges with the flash gas compressor on the Liza Destiny have also been overcome resulting in steady continually safe operations on the vessel. Production on the Destiny remains above 120 000 barrels per day while the flare is maintained at regulatory required levels.

“At ExxonMobil Guyana our teams strive for continuous improvement in our operations and environmental performance. In early 2022 we expect to install a newly redesigned flash gas compressor on the Liza Destiny and we will commission the gas injection system on the Liza Unity utilising lessons learned from our first project” Routledge said.

The oil company said it is continuing to ensure that nationals are benefitting from the production of the oil and gas resources and that significant efforts have been made to hire the necessary skills utilise suppliers and ensure that the capabilities are developed to support the needs of the industry.

There are now 3270 Guyanese supporting the company’s petroleum operations an increase of more than 1000 since this time last year. ExxonMobil Guyana and its prime contractors have also spent more than US$540 million with over 800 unique Guyanese vendors.

“It is very important to us that the people of Guyana benefit from our operations not just from the revenues that are generated to the government but also directly through the implementation of the projects” Routledge said adding “we expect over the coming years for more and more benefits to reach more people”.

He made reference to the Gas-to-Energy project which is led by the government as another such opportunity.

“In 2022 as the gas to energy project moves forward we anticipate that there will be a lot more activities in Region Three. So it won’t be just Georgetown it will be reaching other parts of the country as well.”

The launch of the GUY$20 billion (One Guyana dollar=US$0.004 cents) Greater Guyana Initiative in February 2021 was another tangible expression of ExxonMobil Guyana’s commitment to the country.

It is a 10-year pledge by the Stabroek Block Co-venturers to support capacity building. Work has been ongoing with key Technical Vocational Education and Training (TVET) institutions and the University of Guyana while several new projects have been initiated and will be announced in the coming weeks.

“I think the most significant achievement of 2021 is that the entire business was able to move forward and essentially meet all of our commitments which in the face of the pandemic and all the other challenges we’ve seen in the last year is really outstanding. It speaks to the resilience and perseverance of everyone who is involved in this industry including the private sector community partners and the government of Guyana” Routledge said.

The Liza Phase One development with a production capacity of 120000 gross barrels of oil per day delivered its first production in December 2019 utilising the Liza Destiny FPSO. The second phase of the Liza development sanctioned in May 2019 will use the Liza Unity FPSO which sailed to Guyana in October to equip with a gross production capacity of approximately 220000 barrels of oil per day with start-up expected by early 2022.

The third phase of development at the Payara Field was sanctioned in September 2020. First oil is expected in 2024. Payara will utilise the Prosperity FPSO which will have the capacity to produce up to 220000 gross barrels of oil per day.

A fourth development Yellowtail has been identified on the Stabroek Block with an anticipated startup in 2025 pending government approvals and project sanctioning.

Meanwhile every oil company and its sub-contractor must provide to the Guyana government a Local Content Master Plan to lay out their overall capacity plans.

This is in accordance with the Local Content Bill tabled in the National Assembly last week. The legislation states that every master plan must include an employment procurement and capacity development sub-plans; the quality and quantity criteria required for the supply of goods and the provision of services and a statement and estimate of the value of local content to be acquired delivered and rendered for.

This plan shall be submitted to the Minister of Natural Resources for approval within four months of the operation of the Local Content Act or within four months of the grant of a licence or transfer for interest in a licence or enter into a petroleum agreement with the Minister to conduct operations.

The Bill further states that a sub-contractor shall submit its plan to the Natural Resources Minister within four months of entering into an agreement with a contractor another sub-contractor or licensee for the term of the agreement.

The government intends to debate the new legislation in the new year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVwaS5jb20vVG9wX05ld3MvVVMvMjAyMS8xMi8yNS9UaHJlZS1mYW1pbHktbWVtYmVycy10d28tZG9ncy1kaWUtaW4taG91c2UtZmlyZS1uZWFyLVBoaWxhZGVscGhpYS8zOTcxNjQwNDgzMzQxL9IBf2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVwaS5jb20vYW1wL1RvcF9OZXdzL1VTLzIwMjEvMTIvMjUvVGhyZWUtZmFtaWx5LW1lbWJlcnMtdHdvLWRvZ3MtZGllLWluLWhvdXNlLWZpcmUtbmVhci1QaGlsYWRlbHBoaWEvMzk3MTY0MDQ4MzM0MS8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Three family members two dogs die in house fire near Philadelphia,"Killed in a house fire in Quackerstown Pa. were Eric King sons Liam and Patrick with mother Kristin and elder son Brady escaping with minor injuries. Photo courtesy GoFundMe/Quackerstown School Disrict

Dec. 25 (UPI) -- Three members of one family -- a dad and two sons -- died early Christmas Day in a house fire near Philadelphia that investigators say may have been caused by electrical issues and a dry Christmas tree. Police and fire were dispatched to the house at 1:22 a.m. Saturday in Quarterstown which is about 47 miles north of Philadelpia. Five family members were asleep on the second floor Fire Marshal Doug Wilhelm told CNN. Advertisement

Eric King 41 and his two sons Liam 11 and Patrick 8 died as well as two dogs. The mother Kristin and the family's eldest son Brady an eighth-grader escaped with minor burns and were treated and release at Lehigh Valley Hospital.

""The area of origin was a Christmas tree so we're not sure if it's because of electric or a dried up old Christmas tree"" Wilhelmtold CNN.

First responders had a tough time time entering the house due to the magnitude of the blaze the fire marshal said.

""It was too dangerous to get inside on the front side of the building with the fire"" Wilhelm told CNN. ""The front door and front window were blocked fire was advancing to the entire home at that point. It was very difficult for firefighters to make a safe entry. It took a while.""

Police Chief Scott McElree said the wooden stick-frame construction also likely helped the fire move quickly.

""A Christmas tree burns very quickly and very hot"" McElree told the Courier Times. ""When tree go dry its a violent and robust source. There is an immense amount of heat and that probably contributed.""

A GoFundMe page created in support of the King family has raised more than $200000.

""Eric and Kristin were high school sweethearts and the happiest people you will have ever met"" the post on GoFundMe said. ""They were always smiling and full of positive spirits you just couldn't help but to love them. The three boys Eric and Kristin were all a huge part of the Quakertown Youth Baseball Association and spent their days and nights at the baseball fields.""

The Quakertown School District posted on Facebook: This news is devastating for the District community and the Quakertown area at-large.

""Eric and Kristin are very active in the community and the kind of people who make this a special place to live and attend school.""

The fire also destroyed a home next door.

""I couldn't see anybody so I thought that they got everyone out but it was kind of sad"" Wilson Martinez of Quakertown told WPVI-TV. "" Really sad to realize that not everybody was saved"" said Wilson Martinez of Quakertown."

FedEx Ground will lease the planned 250000-square-foot facility which is expected to be operational in 2022.

John Bosley Enterprises Inc. closed on the sale of the 55-acre tract of land on Bosley Industrial Park Drive behind Walmart and Lowe’s on Wednesday said Larry Headlee a consultant for the Bosley companies.

“The Bosleys have worked diligently on that development project for two years” he said. “It’s going to be a wonderful project for the area.”

A deed had not been recorded at the Wood County Clerk’s office by noon Thursday when the courthouse closed for the Christmas holiday weekend. Non-disclosure agreements prohibited Headlee from discussing more details about the project including the identity of the buyer.

But a spokesman for FedEx Ground confirmed the shipping company will be the end user.

“The new facility will employ a mix of full- and part-time team members” David Westrick with FedEx Ground media relations said in an email. “The company also will contract for package pickup and delivery services with service provider businesses that hire locally for driver helper manager and other positions.”

FedEx continues to see significant package volume as e-commerce grows. The company is working to optimize its capacity to meet increasing demand Westrick said.

“The site was chosen because of its ease of access to major highways proximity to customers’ distribution centers and a strong local community workforce for recruiting employees” he said.

Lindsey Piersol executive director of Wood County Economic Development applauded the Bosley family for its investment to ensure the site was shovel-ready a factor that helped win the project.

“I feel excited about the expansion of our tax base the large investment and the multitude of good-paying jobs” she said. “This is only the beginning of projects that are slated for that area and we believe this will be a driving force.”

According to a building permit filed with Wood County the anticipated cost of the project is $41374853. Headlee and Piersol said construction starts Monday.

“We’re certainly excited about the investment in Wood County and the jobs that will potentially be filled” County Commission President Blair Couch said.

Though the property is outside the city limits Parkersburg officials were enthusiastic about the news as well.

“Anything that expands the tax base and creates jobs is good for the local economy” Mayor Tom Joyce said. “In today’s competitive environment any investment is welcomed and will help our community retain and attract people to the Mid-Ohio Valley.”

“That changes … the whole area down there” City Councilwoman Sharon Kuhl said.

A TikTok showing a Fedex delivery driver walk off with a package immediately after ringing a customer’s doorbell has racked up more than a million views.

The clip which has since been made private shows the driver take off before the owner has a chance to sign for the parcel.

“When the package requires a signature & FedEx says they attempted to deliver” the TikTok user wrote according to the Daily Dot.

“I couldn’t even get to the door quick enough before he was gone.”

In a reply to one comment claiming it was her fault because it was a final attempt to deliver the woman said: “The guy ding-dong ditched at my door which is rude.”

Many shared their own stories of delivery drivers departing before they could answer the door in the comments section.

“FedEx told me they couldn’t deliver one of my packages cuz supposedly my dog was being aggressive I don’t even have a dog” one commenter said.

In a statement to The Independent a Fedex spokeswoman said the delivery worker pictured in the TikTok “is no longer employed within our operations”.

“The views expressed in this post do not reflect the extraordinary commitment and dedication shared by more than 600000 FedEx team members around the world who are focused on helping to deliver the holidays for our customers this season.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vbXlmb3g4LmNvbS9uZXdzL25vcnRoLWNhcm9saW5hLWZlZGV4LWRyaXZlci1hY2N1c2VkLWluLWF0LWxlYXN0LTExLWJyZWFrLWlucy_SAVlodHRwczovL215Zm94OC5jb20vbmV3cy9ub3J0aC1jYXJvbGluYS1mZWRleC1kcml2ZXItYWNjdXNlZC1pbi1hdC1sZWFzdC0xMS1icmVhay1pbnMvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,North Carolina FedEx driver accused in at least 11 break-ins,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://myfox8.com/news/north-carolina-fedex-driver-accused-in-at-least-11-break-ins/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vbXlmb3g4LmNvbS9uZXdzL25vcnRoLWNhcm9saW5hLWZlZGV4LWRyaXZlci1hY2N1c2VkLWluLWF0LWxlYXN0LTExLWJyZWFrLWlucy_SAVlodHRwczovL215Zm94OC5jb20vbmV3cy9ub3J0aC1jYXJvbGluYS1mZWRleC1kcml2ZXItYWNjdXNlZC1pbi1hdC1sZWFzdC0xMS1icmVhay1pbnMvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5qLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIxLzEyL2lzLXRoZS1wb3N0LW9mZmljZS1vcGVuLW9uLWNocmlzdG1hcy1kYXktMjAyMS1pcy10aGVyZS1tYWlsLWRlbGl2ZXJ5LWRvZXMtdGhlLW1haWwtcnVuLmh0bWzSAY4BaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmouY29tL2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMjEvMTIvaXMtdGhlLXBvc3Qtb2ZmaWNlLW9wZW4tb24tY2hyaXN0bWFzLWRheS0yMDIxLWlzLXRoZXJlLW1haWwtZGVsaXZlcnktZG9lcy10aGUtbWFpbC1ydW4uaHRtbD9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is the post office open on Christmas Day 2021?

Ally Bank Account Denial Class Action Lawsuit Overview:

Who: A woman who was brought to the United States as a child and is allowed to work under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program is suing Ally Bank.

Why: The woman says the bank denied her an account because she is not a U.S. citizen or legal permanent resident in violation of the law.

Where: The class action lawsuit was filed in a California federal court.

Ally Bank illegally denies non-United States residents access to bank accounts even if they are legally allowed to work in the country a new class action lawsuit alleges.

Plaintiff Mariela Aguilar Velazquez filed the class action complaint against Ally Bank Dec. 20 in a California federal court alleging violations of the Civil Rights Act and California Civil Code.

Aguilar is a recipient of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.

DACA is a policy that allows immigrants who were brought to the United States as children to receive a renewable two-year period of deferred action from deportation and become eligible for a work permit in the U.S.

Aguilar has had authorization to work in the United States and a Social Security Number since 2012. However in Nov. 2020 she says when she went to open a checking and savings account with Ally Bank she was unlawfully denied.

“Plaintiff Aguilar received a phone call from an Ally Bank representative informing Plaintiff Aguilar that she is ineligible to open a checking and savings account with Ally Bank because she is not a U.S. citizen or an Legal Permanent Resident” the lawsuit says. “Plaintiff Aguilar asked the representative whether this denial was allowed by law. The representative answered that it is Ally Bank’s policy to deny anyone who is not a U.S. citizen or permanent resident.”

Plaintiff Claims No Other Bank Denied Her An Account Because Of Immigration Status

Aguilar is alleging unlawful discrimination on the basis of alienage in violation of the Civil Rights Act and the Unruh Civil Rights Act as codified at California Civil Code. She said no other bank has denied her a bank account because of her immigration status.

“Plaintiff Aguilar suffered harm as a result of Ally Bank’s denial of her checking and savings account application because of her alienage” the lawsuit states. “Ally Bank’s denial of her application caused Plaintiff Aguilar to suffer emotional distress.”

She’s seeking to represent anyone in the United States who was denied a bank account from Ally Bank on the basis of alienage plus a California class.

She’s seeking certification of the class action an injunction damages fees costs and a jury trial.

In 2020 Wells Fargo agreed to pay a $20 million settlement to DACA recipients whose loan applications were denied by Wells Fargo.

NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope launched at 7:20 a.m. EST Saturday on an Ariane 5 rocket from Europe’s Spaceport in French Guiana South America.

A joint effort with ESA (European Space Agency) and the Canadian Space Agency the Webb observatory is NASA’s revolutionary flagship mission to seek the light from the first galaxies in the early universe and to explore our own solar system as well as planets orbiting other stars called exoplanets.

Arianespace’s Ariane 5 rocket launches with NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope onboard Saturday Dec. 25 2021 from the ELA-3 Launch Zone of Europe’s Spaceport at the Guiana Space Centre in Kourou French Guiana. The James Webb Space Telescope (sometimes called JWST or Webb) is a large infrared telescope with a 21.3 foot (6.5 meter) primary mirror. The observatory will study every phase of cosmic history—from within our solar system to the most distant observable galaxies in the early universe.

“The James Webb Space Telescope represents the ambition that NASA and our partners maintain to propel us forward into the future” said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. “The promise of Webb is not what we know we will discover; it’s what we don’t yet understand or can’t yet fathom about our universe. I can’t wait to see what it uncovers!”

Ground teams began receiving telemetry data from Webb about five minutes after launch. The Arianespace Ariane 5 rocket performed as expected separating from the observatory 27 minutes into the flight. The observatory was released at an altitude of approximately 870 miles (1400 kilometers). Approximately 30 minutes after launch Webb unfolded its solar array and mission managers confirmed that the solar array was providing power to the observatory. After solar array deployment mission operators will establish a communications link with the observatory via the Malindi ground station in Kenya and ground control at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore will send the first commands to the spacecraft.

Engineers and ground controllers will conduct the first of three mid-course correction burns about 12 hours and 30 minutes after launch firing Webb’s thrusters to maneuver the spacecraft on an optimal trajectory toward its destination in orbit about 1 million miles from Earth.

“I want to congratulate the team on this incredible achievement – Webb’s launch marks a significant moment not only for NASA but for thousands of people worldwide who dedicated their time and talent to this mission over the years” said Thomas Zurbuchen associate administrator for the Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington. “Webb’s scientific promise is now closer than it ever has been. We are poised on the edge of a truly exciting time of discovery of things we’ve never before seen or imagined.”

The world’s largest and most complex space science observatory will now begin six months of commissioning in space. At the end of commissioning Webb will deliver its first images. Webb carries four state-of-the-art science instruments with highly sensitive infrared detectors of unprecedented resolution. Webb will study infrared light from celestial objects with much greater clarity than ever before. The premier mission is the scientific successor to NASA’s iconic Hubble and Spitzer space telescopes built to complement and further the scientific discoveries of these and other missions.

“The launch of the Webb Space Telescope is a pivotal moment – this is just the beginning for the Webb mission” said Gregory L. Robinson Webb’s program director at NASA Headquarters. “Now we will watch Webb’s highly anticipated and critical 29 days on the edge. When the spacecraft unfurls in space Webb will undergo the most difficult and complex deployment sequence ever attempted in space. Once commissioning is complete we will see awe-inspiring images that will capture our imagination.”

The telescope’s revolutionary technology will explore every phase of cosmic history – from within our solar system to the most distant observable galaxies in the early universe to everything in between. Webb will reveal new and unexpected discoveries and help humanity understand the origins of the universe and our place in it.

NASA Headquarters oversees the mission for the agency’s Science Mission Directorate. NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt Maryland manages Webb for the agency and oversees work on the mission performed by the Space Telescope Science Institute Northrop Grumman and other mission partners. In addition to Goddard several NASA centers contributed to the project including the agency’s Johnson Space Center in Houston Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville Alabama Ames Research Center in California’s Silicon Valley and others.

Sydney-based solar startup SunDrive which created the most efficient commercial-sized silicon solar cell in the world in September has taken to social media to announce its latest feat – the successful fabrication of its first full-size solar panel.

From a garage in Sydney’s south SunDrive’s chief executive started the company with former flatmate David Hu in 2015 based on a solution developed while completing his PhD at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) adding another chapter to UNSW’s storied solar history.

The solution reached by hundreds of experiments in trial and error amounts to a major shakeup of the solar industry’s Chinese cell manufacturing supremacy and replaces traditional and expensive silver use in solar cells with the much more abundant and much cheaper copper. Copper is not as conductive as silver nor as adhesive to the solar cell but Allen’s solution rectifies this disparity as evidenced by its 25.54 world efficiency record confirmed by the German Institute for Solar Energy Research (ISFH).

This week’s announcement that SunDrive has successfully fabricated its first full-size panel is another major milestone on the company’s journey from photovoltaic breakthrough to commercial success.

“From our process engineers interconnecting every cell to our build team designing the tools to make all this possible everyone has put in immense effort to making this a reality” the company said in a post on LinkedIn. “We are now gearing up to fully automate our technology as we continue to grow our world class team.”

The big “If” of SunDrive has always been whether it can mass produce its technology. If so the Aussie startup could usher in the next great solar panel cost reduction while also lessening the industry’s dependence on silver a precious metal of rapidly increasing price.

Silver is central to today’s solar panels. It is estimated solar panel manufacturing accounts for approximately 20% of the world’s annual consumption a figure which is only going to increase thanks to the next generation of high-efficiency cells which can require up to three times more silver than previous generations.

Allen has previously said SunDrive’s aim is to produce the cells locally optimistic that they can compete with large solar manufacturers in Asia while protecting their intellectual property.

“The industry today is at a point where the land and labor costs are becoming less and less significant in the total cost of manufacturing … obviously it does mean that we need to at least match that similar level of automation and throughput but we do see opportunity to do it in Australia” he said.

On top of more than $2 million in grants from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) SunDrive has already attracted high-profile investors including Australian billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes’s Grok Ventures.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveHdlYXRoZXIuY29tL2VhcnRoLXNwYWNlL3RoZS1kYXktdGhlLW5vcnRoZXJuLWxpZ2h0cy1jb3ZlcmVkLXRoZS1wbGFuZXQtaGlzdG9yeS1lYXJ0aHMtZ3JlYXRlc3Qtc29sYXItc3Rvcm1z0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A history of Earth's greatest solar storms including the day the Northern Lights covered the planet,"It's late summer in 1859 but what seems like a normal day suddenly becomes surreal. Telegraph lines mysteriously start sparking and fail; some telegraph offices erupt in flames. Much of the communication across the globe goes dark for several hours.

Later as night falls the skies erupt in a color as a brilliant display of the Northern Lights covers nearly the entire planet with reports as far south as Tahiti Cuba Jamaica Colombia and Hawaii.

LEARN: 7 THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT THE NORTHERN LIGHTS

Witnesses of the time speak of auroras so bright that those in New England were able to read the newspaper in the middle of the night. And it was so bright in Colorado that miners thought the sun was coming up and it was time to begin their shifts.

What had just happened was a solar storm for the ages.

The storm named the Carrington Event after British astronomer Richard Carrington who witnessed and documented the event struck with surprising speed on Sept. 1. Carrington was in his private observatory tracking the sun when he noticed an unusually large cluster of sun spots. Suddenly the spots were awash in blinding light.

""What Carrington saw was a white-light solar flare -- a magnetic explosion on the sun"" explains David Hathaway solar physics team lead at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville Alabama.

Just hours later a coronal mass ejection hurtled across space and struck the Earth's magnetic field resulting in an extreme geomagnetic storm. The impact caused the magnetic field to shake and quiver which then induced enormous electrical currents that surged through telegraph lines according to NASA.

But while the Carrington Event still stands as the top solar storm in the record books several other solar flares have wreaked havoc. On Aug. 4 1972 a solar flare knocked out long-distance telephone communications across Illinois according to NASA.

Then on March 13 1989 all of Quebec lost power when an extremely strong solar flare disrupted power transmission from the province's main power generating station leaving 6 million in the dark for nine hours. Power surges from that event also melted power transformers in New Jersey.

Even in more modern-day times solar flares can cause issues. In December 2005 X-rays from a solar storm disrupted satellite and GPS communications for about 10 minutes. A short time in theory but ""I would not have wanted to be on a commercial airplane being guided in for a landing by GPS or on a ship being docked by GPS during that 10 minutes"" said Louis J. Lanzerotti retired Distinguished Member of Technical Staff at Bell Laboratories and editor of the journal Space Weather.

A communications nightmare in the making?

While solar flares don’t have any direct effects on human health there's concern over what a Carrington-level solar event would do to infrastructure in the modern communications world.

According to NASA researchers from Lloyd’s of London and the Atmospheric and Environmental Research agency in the United States studied what would happen if a Carrington-class event struck today and estimate it would cause anywhere from $600 million to $2.6 trillion in damage alone to the U.S. and could cause global electrical disruptions blackouts and electrical grid damage.

""Cascading failures of electrical grids especially in New England in the United States are also particularly likely during a Carrington-class event"" NASA officials said. ""Power restoration estimates range anywhere from a week to the least affected areas to more than a year to the hardest-hit regions.""

But the possible impacts don't stop there. Scientists worry electronic payments would crash electric vehicle charging stations could become unusable for some time as would ATMs which rely on internet and satellite links to verify account information.

GPS navigation signals could be crippled and planes flying over oceans could experience navigation errors and communication blackouts NASA says. Astronauts on the International Space Station would have to shelter in a radiation-protection module or if enough time permitted evacuate the station and come home.

Earth dodged a bullet in 2012

A flare of that magnitude nearly happened just a decade ago. In July 2012 a Carrington-class solar storm erupted from the sun. But luckily the sun’s rotation at the time had the solar flare aim its wrath away from Earth missing a direct hit by just nine days. And research suggests these magnitudes of solar storms may not be as rare as once thought.

""The Carrington Event was not unique"" Hisashi Hayakawa of Japan's Nagoya University told SpaceWeather.com in 2020. His recent study of solar storms has uncovered other events of comparable intensity. ""While the Carrington Event has long been considered a once-in-a-century catastrophe historical observations warn us that this may be something that occurs much more frequently.""

The good news is NASA has several satellites monitoring the sun these days and could provide a multi-day warning of the impending solar storm giving us time to shut down and protect major communication systems pause transoceanic flights and essentially hunker down until the storm passed.

""But a harsh truth remains"" NASA scientists warned in 2020. ""161 years after the Carrington Event the world is still not prepared for a large-scale solar storm and what it would do to us.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9kYy1tZC12YS8yMDIxLzEyLzI1L2dyZWVuYmFuay1tb250Z29tZXJ5LWNvdW50eS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Green banks gain ground as communities strive for climate action,The church’s congregants are environmentally minded and made it a point in recent years to incorporate climate change into their teachings and build gardens across the church’s five-acre plot to absorb runoff rainwater and grow edible plants. Solar panels which could yield energy savings as the church expanded its digital services seemed like a logical next step.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNvbGFycXVvdGVzLmNvbS5hdS9ibG9nL3NvbGFyLXBvbHlzaWxpY29uLXByaWNlcy1tYjIyODcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Solar Polysilicon Prices Start To Plummet - Solar Quotes Blog,"by

In a bit of good news the spot price for solar grade polysilicon is dropping quite rapidly. If the trend holds the cost of solar panels in Australia should follow suit soon-ish.

Polysilicon is used in the manufacture of conventional photovoltaic cells used in solar panels. The sought-after stuff was as cheap as chips in July last year when it was below USD $7/kg. But a series of events including impacts from the pandemic and a couple of factory fires saw it skyrocket.

Polysilicon spot prices were as high as US$36.64/kg at the beginning of this month. But here’s what’s happened in the last few weeks as reported by Bernreuter Research.

As at yesterday’s update the polysilicon spot price was US$32.00 per kg – down around 12% on early December.

What’s Pushing Polysilicon Prices Down?

Helping things along is new production capacity coming online.

A phase of Tongwei‘s Sichuan plant expansion was completed last month with 50000 metric tons (MT) capacity annually coming into play. This was shortly followed by GCL-Poly commissioning an additional 20000 MT capacity.

Early this month another polysilicon power player – Daqo New Energy Corp – announced construction of its 35000 MT Phase 4B polysilicon production facility had been completed ahead of schedule and initial production had already kicked off. The company expects the new facility will be cranking at full capacity by the end of March 2022.

Not long after Daqo’s announcement Tongwei announced new production capacity of 50000 metric tons at its factory in Yunnan province.

From Famine Back To Feast?

While all this new capacity might not even touch the sides of future demand there’s a bunch more production capacity likely to come online within the next couple of years.

For example Daqo reportedly announced yesterday plans to expand capacity in Baotou City Inner Mongolia with a further 200000 MT annual production. The first phase of the project 100000 MT is expected to start in the first quarter of 2022 and be completed for the second quarter of 2023.

Polysilicon isn’t the only material that pushed up the cost of installing solar panels – other module components such as glass experienced price hikes and the cost of shipping solar gear skyrocketed too. However the current situation provides a glimmer of hope it won’t be too long before solar panels present even better value than currently.

But waiting for that to occur might not be a good idea. Aside from the ever-present threat of Murphy’s Law and polysilicon prices traditionally weakening around this time of year the best time to go solar is usually right now regardless of what’s happening. Each day without it you’re paying for electricity you could be generating yourself from your home’s rooftop.

Try the SolarQuotes solar calculator to see what solar energy could do for your household.

Side note: While Daqo has been raking it in thanks to high prices a potential glut of polysilicon hasn’t been doing its share price any favours. As soon as a whiff of this occurred it was punished by the market.

The Cardinals selected the Tulsa linebacker 16th overall in the 2021 NFL Draft and his overall grade as a pro now sits at 67.4. That makes him the sixth-ranked rookie linebacker among those eligible.

The 2021 season has been a bit of a mystery for Collins. The Cardinals anointed him as starting MIKE linebacker on draft night which never materialized with veteran Jordan Hicks playing well. Collins’ snap counts have diminished significantly in the second half of the season not playing a defensive snap the last two weeks.

However Collins has played a larger role in special teams and even recovered the much-needed onside kick in the dwindling moments of the Cardinals’ Week 14 loss to the Los Angeles Rams on Monday Night Football.

Even with his lack of playing time in recent weeks his grade from PFF could be reflective of the work he did when on the field.

Collins has just one game since Week 7 with more than 10 snaps on defense and while that was a rough performance he had been impressive in games earlier in the season.

Collins has tallied 22 total tackles on the year including one tackle for loss.

No. 11 overall pick Micah Parsons of the Dallas Cowboys was the top ranked rookie at the linebacker position though he has been moved into a hybrid pass-rushing role. The Cowboys have used Parsons in a number of ways defensively playing him 21 snaps against the run 23 in coverage and 12 snaps rushing the passer against the New York Giants in Week 15.

We all love dividend income here in the nation but HATE waiting for it so we’re building a portfolio of dividend stocks that don’t make you wait! A dividend investing strategy that will put cash in your account every single day!

In this video I’m revealing 17 dividend stocks with an average yield of 4.9%…that’s nearly three-times the yield on the broader market. Better still combine these with the stocks in the first two videos in the series and you’ll create a portfolio that pays you every day!

How to Create a Dividend Portfolio for Daily Cash

We can do this because most dividend stocks pay out on extremely consistent schedules. Investors love the certainty and dividend-paying companies try paying out in the same week even the same day every three months. That means with a little bit of strategy we can fill our portfolio with income stocks that will time our payments for every day of the week.

Now how this is going to work is through these three videos I’ll highlight those dividend income stocks that will be paying out in the next month. For example today we’ll highlight 17 dividend stocks that will pay out in December March June and September. I’ll show you exactly how I found these stocks later in the video but here you can see that I analyzed almost 400 dividend stocks to find the perfect income portfolio for each and every month.

The goal here is going to be about 60 stocks that will generate a dividend income on every weekday of each month. And the best part not only is this going to be a well-diversified portfolio producing constant dividends I’ve picked the best dividend stocks with a yield over 4%…that’s twice the average dividend yield on the market.

Dividend Stocks for Constant Cash Flow

Let’s jump right into that list then I’ll show you how I put together the portfolio of daily dividend stocks!

We’re getting started with a fan favorite Iron Mountain ticker IRM and one of the best dividend yields on the list at nine percent.

IRM is a records management provider with more than 225000 clients trusting it to store hard copy documents as well as digital transformations and storage. But the real value here comes in the form of the company’s real estate where all this is stored more than 90 million square feet across almost 1500 properties.

The company is set up as a real estate investment trust which means it gets a special tax break if it distributes at least 90% of profits to investors. That means you get that sky-high 9% yield with the stock going ex-dividend about mid-month in December March June and September.

IRM is a great start to our dividend portfolio and has grown its payout by 27% over the last five years.

Now remember the dates you’re going to see here on these dividend stocks are the ex-dividend date. How it works is a company’s Board of Directors declares the next dividend and the ex-dividend date. That ex-dividend date is the first day the shares trade WITHOUT the dividend so if you want that payout you want to make sure you pick up the shares at least one day before this.

The idea here isn’t to jump in or out of these dividend stocks so this isn’t going to matter as much to you long-term investors. Just put the stock in your portfolio and you’ll get that dividend every time it comes around.

Next on the list of daily dividend stocks powerhouse Altria Group ticker MO and its 8.8% dividend.

Now if you’re set against investing in some of these vice stocks then you can always substitute out another dividend payer that goes ex-dividend around the same time but for yield and dividend certainty it’s hard to beat Altria.

Besides owning the dominant tobacco brand in the U.S. and a dividend that has grown by 53% over the last five years Altria has some key investments that will help it grow. The company holds a 10% stake in the world’s largest brewer Anheuser-Busch and a 45% stake in cannabis giant Cronos Group. So you’ve got very stable cash flow from the tobacco and alcohol segments and that moonshot potential in cannabis.

Altria is one of the later stocks to go ex-dividend on our list late in December March June and September. That means you’ll usually get your dividend payment about two weeks later.

Our first stock in the financials $12 billion KeyCorp ticker KEY and its 5.8% dividend yield.

KeyCorp is a small regional bank with branches in 16 states but concentrated mostly in Ohio and New York. And those of you in the Nation now financials are one of my favorite sectors for the next couple of years. The sector has been slammed by low rates and is trading at a deep discount.

Case in point shares of KeyCorp trade for just 0.81-times book value which is a 38% discount to the 1.3 multiple it traded at last year. So potentially a lot of value to be unlocked if interest rates start heading higher and the economy keeps growing.

Beyond valuation and the high dividend yield KeyCorp has lately made some strong acquisitions in technology names like HelloWallet and Laurel Road which could give it surprise growth above other regional banks.

The dividend payment has boomed 146% over the past five years and usually goes ex-dividend during the first days of the month in December March June and August.

Another value play here $3.5 billion oil play Devon Energy ticker DVN and its 5% yield.

Next to financials energy is my other big call for the next few years and in fact I’ve added Devon Energy into our 2021 Bow Tie Nation portfolio on Stockcard.

If you’re looking for one sector where everyone is fearful and it may be time to be greedy it’s in the energy space. The price of oil crashed this year on loss of demand and the entire sector has fallen 49% year-to-date.

Will Oil Stocks Recover in 2021?

Being ahead of this means finding those cash-rich best of breed oil companies with the survivability to recover when the market does and Devon is one of the best in the space. The company has nearly $1.5 billion in balance sheet cash and will have no problem keeping up with its debt.

Despite dropping into negative earnings last quarter the company still beat the market estimate by 30% and is expected to return to profitability by the first quarter.

Shares usually go ex-dividend mid-month in December March June and September and paid out a special dividend August this year. Even the lowest analyst estimate has shares up 42% over the next year for a potentially huge upside along with the dividend.

Omnicom ticker OMC is the world’s second-largest ad holding company spanning public relations traditional and digital advertising.

Ad spending is the first to go when company budgets get tight so it’s no surprise that Omnicom has sold off this year but it’s still a solid company. The company has over $3.3 billion in balance sheet cash so no near-term financial problems and is trading at a discount of 38% from its peak.

Management has a history of beating expectations and is positioned to take advantage of the growth in digital ads. The dividend payment has grown a respectable 30% over the past five years and shares go ex-dividend early- to mid-month.

Adding some diversification here with Archer-Daniels Midland ticker ADM and its 2.9% dividend.

Agricultural producers have just started rebounding this year after years of trade war pain and I think there’s further to go for processors like ADM. The company has one of the largest networks for crop storage and transportation which should do well as the trade picture improves.

Even under the weaker environment the dividend here grew by 28% over the last five years and I expect that to pick up. Shares go ex-dividend mid- to late-month in November February May and August.

Another energy name here with Schlumberger Limited ticker SLB and its 3.3% dividend yield.

Now this one is probably the riskiest of my energy bets but still a fairly solid company with $3.8 billion in balance sheet cash. As an oil-field services company Schlumberger has seen its revenue plunge this year as explorers pull back and let some of their fields go into maintenance.

The company is one of the best in its industry with an advantage in drilling that’s hard to beat so there’s a very good chance this one survives and produces not only that dividend but a hefty price return as well. The dividend was cut 75% in June to protect cash flow but still pays that 3.3% yield and goes ex-dividend usually towards the beginning of the month.

How to Pick Dividend Stocks for Daily Payments

We’ve got ten more dividend stocks to highlight and stick with me because we’ve got the highest yields coming up.

I want to go through real quickly how I picked these stocks how I put the portfolio together so you can find your own dividend stocks or just adjust the portfolio when you need to.

Now the concept is easy but it took hours to put together the data on this. I took the 366 stocks in the S&P 500 that pay dividends nearly 400 large-cap companies I then went to the stock page for each one. You can find this on any investing platform but I went to Yahoo Finance and then to this Historical Data tab.

From here I changed the time period and then to Show Dividends Only to see the dividend dates for the last five years. I took that and copied it into my spreadsheet for every single stock noting the dividend dates over the last year.

Once I did that I could note when each dividend stock paid out on each day and then could pick the best for our portfolio. For example for today’s video there were 178 stocks going ex-dividend mid-November and into December.

This allowed me not only to create an income portfolio that pays out nearly every weekday of the month but also to select only the strongest companies with the highest dividend yields.

More Dividend Stocks You Can Count On

Prologis ticker PLD is in one of my favorite real estate types right now and pays a 2.25% dividend.

My Bow Tie Warriors out there you know I love real estate. Got my professional start there as a commercial property analyst and have my own rentals but some of the property types are looking UGLY this year!

Eight of the 12 REIT property sectors are posting losses this year with some getting absolutely smashed. Retail down 39% lodging is down 49% and office space is down 30% for 2020. But there are some sectors doing relatively well like industrial self-storage and data centers are booming.

And Prologis is a leader in that industrial space with 900 million square feet of logistics and warehouse property. Strength in the segment is being driven by ecommerce and the need for those distribution centers and it’s a great long-term trend to be in.

The dividend payment has increased by 45% over the last five years and usually goes ex-dividend mid-month December March June and September.

CBOE Global Markets ticker CBOE operates the options exchange in Chicago and pays a 2% dividend yield.

CBOE is one of the smaller exchanges that have yet to be consolidated into the larger companies but still operates the largest U.S. options exchange as well as a futures exchange. With the growth in retail stock trading this year I’m surprised shares haven’t done better and I like this one as a rebound play.

The dividend has nearly doubled growing 83% over the last five years and it’s a great cash-flow stock going ex-dividend late-month in November February May and August.

Another investor favorite on the list here with the 3M Company ticker MMM and its 3.5% dividend yield.

3M is one of the oldest companies on the list around since 1902 and one that has increased its dividend for an amazing 62-consecutive years.

The company operates in four segments; industrial transportation and electronics healthcare and consumer which gives it a breadth you probably won’t find anywhere else and helps protect that cash flow.

As big as it is the dividend growth surprised me here with 43% growth in the payment in the last five years along with a stable price return. Shares go ex-dividend mid-month in November February May and August.

Another in the financial sector this one in insurance with Prudential Financial ticker PRU and its 6.7% dividend.

Prudential is the second-largest life insurer in the U.S. with significant exposure in Japan as well. The entire industry has been hit on those low interest rates making it harder for insurers to earn a return on their cash reserves but management has released a plan to cut $500 million in costs to boost the bottom line.

Shares trade for a 30% discount on a price-to-book value trading for just 0.4-times the book value of assets and this one has grown the dividend by a solid 57% over the last five years.

Hey Nation while I’ve got you here can I ask a favor? If you’re on Instagram head on over after this video and join the Let’s Talk Money community. I’m sharing motivational quotes investing advice and a personal side I don’t get to show here on the channel so I hope I see you there.

Six more dividend stocks to round out the list and next is Waste Management ticker WM and its 1.9% dividend yield.

Now a 2% yield might not sound so great but this stock has produced an annualized 12.2% return on top of that yield over the last decade. It’s the largest solid waste services company in the U.S. with over 250 land fills and let’s face it probably one of the most stable business models there is.

The share price isn’t the only thing growing with the dividend up 42% over the last five years and one where you can count on future growth.

I highlighted Huntington Bancshares ticker HBAN recently as a favorite in the financials and its 6.3% dividend yield.

Huntington is another small regional bank with branches across eight states in the Midwest. The bank has doubled the amount in its loan loss provision account to over $1.7 billion and has still been able to consistently beat earnings expectations. It’s trading at a 35% discount to last year’s price-to-book multiple and if loan defaults aren’t as bad as feared could see a major earnings surprise.

Even with the slowdown over the past year the dividend has grown 114% over the last five years for a great yield on top of that price potential.

A little more of a safety pick here with PPL Corporation ticker PPL and its 6% dividend.

PPL is a regulated utility provider in Pennsylvania and Kentucky that recently announced plans to sell off its UK operations. That will take a lot of the uncertainty out of the business model and allow the company to focus on its U.S. operations. The move gives it more dividend stability and should also improve investor sentiment in the shares.

And that dividend uncertainty has played out with just a 10% dividend growth over the past five years the lowest in our group but I think you see it start rising from here.

Another agriculture play here with FMC Corporation ticker FMC and its 1.6% dividend yield.

Now another one with a relatively low dividend but an amazing total return producing a 12.6% annual price return over the last decade on top of that yield.

FMC is a pure-play crop chemical company and should benefit from that long-term trend to food demand and the need for higher crop yields. Shares are fairly valued here but it’s hard to argue with a 166% growth in the dividend over five years and that kind of long-term price return.

A little riskier bet in the real estate space is Ventas ticker VTR a healthcare REIT and its 4.3% dividend.

Ventas owns a portfolio of 1200 properties across medical office hospital and healthcare but concentrated in the senior living and skilled nursing niche. Most healthcare properties have been hit this year but most especially the senior care market but it looks like even this is turning more positive.

Occupancy hasn’t declined significantly and with a vaccine approval we should get better investor sentiment in names like Ventas. Shares are down 41% from last year’s peak and the company did cut the dividend this year to protect cash flow but I think it can be a strong long-term investment.

Valero Energy ticker VLO offers our highest yield of the group with a dividend just under 10%.

One of the largest refinery operations in the U.S. with 14 facilities in North America and the U.K. the company is uniquely positioned to refine lower-quality crude and has been able to produce higher profit margins.

The refineries have been hit just like all energy companies but quality names like Valero will survive. The company also owns over 3100 miles of pipeline and other midstream assets that give it a transportation advantage.

Valero is one of the very few in the energy space to maintain its dividend this year and has nearly doubled it over the past five years.

November Dividends List

The 17 stocks in this months portfolio produce a dividend yield of 4.9% just slightly above the entire 56-stock portfolio with a 4.2% yield. That’s 56 dividend-paying companies in every sector with a yield more than double the overall market that is going to put cash in your pocket every single day!

Investing in Dividends is Safe and Steady

What is the one thing everybody wants?

Money.

Everybody wants some more money but not everyone is willing to work hard for it. What if you are someone who does not want to have to work for your money? Well you can just leave that up to the stock market! Stocks are a way of owning part of a company and owning something means having rights to some of what that business makes. When companies make money they have to decide what to do with it put it in the bank (savings) invest in new equipment (capital expenditures) or give it back to shareholders (dividends).

However most companies choose option number 3 giving dividends back! There are two types of dividends: cash dividends and stock dividends. Cash dividends are just that money! You will get a check in your mailbox or direct deposited into your account. The amount changes every quarter since it depends on how much the company made.

Dividends are one of the most important things when it comes to buying stocks. There are many different types of investors you can be but dividends should definitely make up a big part of your strategy. If you do not actually get money every time the company makes money then what good does it do? Well dividends are taxed less than regular income so if you want to keep more of your own money they allow for this! Not only this but it is very safe. When they give you that money it is real money in your bank account (or brokerage statement). If something bad happens to the stock market then there is no chance they will go bankrupt and stop paying out dividends.

There are many different types of dividends you can get: quarterly dividend special dividend variable dividend high yield dividend  etc. They have different rules for how often you get them or how much they are. A good company will usually payout a very high percentage of their earnings each year as cash dividends – usually 4-5%. You are probably thinking this sounds too good to be true and you would be right. There are a few things to keep in mind when investing in dividend paying stocks.

Dividends are one of the most important things when it comes to picking stocks they can make a huge difference over time! They allow companies to pay back investors for all their hard work while still having some left over for themselves. Plus they offer lower risk than normal investments because they do not fluctuate as much as the stock price does. However beware that dividends may decrease or stop completely if you invest in a company during a bad period. It is also very important for investors looking for these high yields to have a lot of research on their potential investments.

I thought I was done with Friday Social for the year but then Ford had to log onto Twitter and post some electric vehicle memes to its 1.3 million followers.

Earlier this year Ford shook up the automotive and cleantech sectors when it announced the Ford F-150 Lightning. This week it again shook up the two now-converging sectors — but this time with memes.

Simon Mahan went as far as to say that Ford won ​“the #energytwitter MVP award this week.”

National Highway Traffic Safety Administration

AWD

On June 9th the automaker’s Driveline Engineering department notified the Critical Concern Review Group of an increase in warranty reports alleging loose or missing bolts. More specifically bolts where the driveshaft connects to the transfer case’s. While investigating the issue the CCRG remembered investigating a report from a fleet customer of five vehicles in September 2020 alleging the same problem.In the period from August to October 2021 the Blue Oval identified one Transit with one bolt missing one bolt fractured and the remaining bolts loose. The Ford Motor Company is currently aware of 50 reports alleging loose or missing bolts of which 22 reports allege driveshaft separation Thankfully for the customer and Ford’s legal team no accidents or injuries are related to this condition. Manufactured by Michigan-based Neapco Holdings the driveshaft assembly will be replaced by the dealership at no charge if even one bolt of the six CVJ attachment bolts is loose. By assembly the Dearborn-based automaker also refers to the flange kit and transfer case seal for extra peace of mind. On vehicles that don’t have a loose bolt only the bolts will be replaced as per theCustomers will be notified of the recall sometime between January 31st and February 4th. As for the affected vehicle population the suspect Transitwas produced between May 1st 2019 through February 1st 2020.For the 2022 model year the Transit panel van carries an MSRP of $35925 sans taxes for the XL trim level with the 3.5-liter PFDi V6 engine 3.73 non-limited slip axle low roof 130-inch wheelbase and 10-speed auto.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0cmVldG11c2NsZW1hZy5jb20vZmVhdHVyZXMvcm9icy1tb3ZpZS1tdXNjbGUtdGhlLXNoZWxieS1tdXN0YW5nLWZyb20tbmVlZC1mb3Itc3BlZWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rob's Movie Muscle: The Shelby Mustang From Need For Speed,"I’ve made it clear numerous times before in the pages of this column as well as those of Rob’s Car Movie Review that Hollywood has seemingly forgotten how to make a good old-fashioned car movie.

By that I mean movies that truly revel in the art of the automobile. That capture the holy union of man and machine as one at high speed. That exude the kind of passion for what we gear-heads understand: that there are few things finer in life than nailing a perfect heel-to-toe downshift smelling and hearing the ticking sound of hot brakes after a lap on a track or the pleasure of turning a wrench one’s self to bolster a car’s performance.

Sure we get a new installment of the Fast and the Furious franchise every couple of years but the ridiculous machinations in those films have become so insipid so consumed with superhero-esqe antics that for this film reviewer at least there is no connection to what made the first in the series such an archetypal grounded car movie.

Thankfully it seems that every once in a blue moon a genuine dyed-in-the-wool car flick does manage to squeak onto the silver screen keeping the genre alive if not on life support.

One such film was 2011’s Drive which while appropriating a number elements from great automotive movies from the past was largely an art film and thus too lofty for many gear-heads to embrace.

And then 2014 brought forward the big budget actioner Need for Speed. While itself not short on moments that are about as grounded as Halley’s Comet this movie nonetheless reveled in the celebration of the automobile more than any other film in recent decades.

Much of the automotive spirit in the movie was embodied in its main hero vehicle a highly modified 2013 Ford Mustang and for this installment of Rob’s Movie Muscle we’re gonna take a good look at it.

Based on the all-conquering blockbuster video game series of the same name Need for Speed was a co-production of DreamWorks Pictures Reliance Entertainment Touchstone Pictures Bandito Brothers and Electronic Arts the company that created the original game. The film was theatrically released in the United States by Walt Disney Studios.

Directed by Scott Waugh based on a script by George Gatins the movie had an appealing ensemble cast that included Breaking Bad’s Aaron Paul Academy Award winner Rami Malek Dominic Cooper Imogen Poots Kid Cudi Dakota Johnson and Michael Keaton.

Unlike many films with video game origins such as Tomb Raider Mortal Combat et al Need for Speed actually has a coherent plot that sees Aaron Paul’s character a street racer and speed shop owner try to save his failing business first by finishing a build on a historically significant car and then driving it cross-country to pilot it in the world’s most extreme illegal street race.

The car in question is depicted as being the final Mustang collaboration between Ford and Carroll Shelby that was left unfinished owing to the latter’s untimely death.

Although the film is jam-packed with excellent cars ranging from 1960s-era Camaros GTOs and Torinos to contemporary hypercars such as the Koenigsegg Agera R Lamborhini Sesto Elemento and Bugatti Veyron Super Sport it is most assuredly the Shelby that is the star of the show.

This came to be largely because of director Waugh’s background and vision. A Los Angeles native and a former stuntman Waugh grew up watching the classic car movies of the ’60s and ’70s and worshiping the cars and the silver screen heroes who drove them.

“Some of the best car movies are still from the ’60s and ’70s from my perspective. I mean we still always only say Bullitt French Connection Grand Prix Smokey and the Bandit. I have a lot of subtle throwbacks in Need for Speed to all these car movies whether it’s American Graffiti Vanishing Point Cannonball Run and the rest. I still think Bullitt‘s car chase is incredible it has a raw grittiness plus it had Steve McQueen and Steve McQueen actually drove in it” the director said in a 2014 interview.

Because of this Waugh instinctively knew what car was right for his movie.

“I wanted a car to represent the average consumer’s modern version of muscle. Personally I was always a Carroll Shelby fan and when Carroll passed away it hit me hard; he was such an innovator. Plus the Mustang is the car Steve McQueen drove. I think it’s cool. Bullitt set the tone for car culture movies. And the Mustang in Need for Speed is the Bullitt car if you think about it – it was a ’68 Mustang in a ’68 movie. I thought if I’m doing a 2013 movie let’s make it a 2013 Mustang right?”

Then Partner and Co-Chair of DreamWorks Studios Stacey Snider concurred.

“Need for Speed is rooted in Americana and when we were casting our hero car for the film Ford Mustang was the obvious choice” Snider said at the time. “With its 50-year history in film the iconic Mustang is the perfect co-star for Aaron Paul.”

Having chosen the hero vehicle for the film Waugh and DreamWorks reached out to Ford Motor Company itself to help design the fabled final “Carroll car.”

Ford designer Melvin Betancourt was enlisted to put pen to paper and sketch what he thought Ford and Shelby might have actually concocted. He envisioned an extremely aggressive car with custom bodywork that featured wider fenders front and rear a gaping maw in the lower front fascia a dual-scoop hood low profile side mirrors unique side scoops vents replacing the Mustang’s quarter-windows and a modified diffuser and rear spoiler. He sketched the car having traditional dual over-the-top stripes as a nod to Shelby history.

With a design in hand the production subcontracted Technosports Creative LLC and Steeda to build the eight cars necessary for production. Starting with a stock 2013 Shelby GT500 and seven Mustang GTs  Technosports removed every body panel from the vehicles and started from scratch.

Staying largely true to the design they crafted a widebody kit with a face that was dominated by multiple massive cooling ducts and a deep splitter. A Mustang GT grille insert was grafted in with LED halo lights replacing the standard driving lights.

The hood was outfitted with a pair of massive non-functional scoops reminiscent of those seen on some Golden Era muscle cars such as the 1969 Hurst/Olds and the 1970 Dodge Coronet R/T.

As with Betancourt’s design the rear quarter windows were replaced by non-functional scoops and the side view mirrors were replaced with thin stalks ostensibly encasing (shockingly non-functional) cameras. The rear was recognizably Shelby but with a more pronounced diffuser undertray and exhaust treatment.

The car was painted in a subtle shade of silver with dual Kona Blue stripes.

The cars were transported to Steeda and under the new aggressive bodies lowered heavy-duty suspension Bilstein shocks and thicker sway bars were installed to enhance handling for the film’s stunt drivers. The car rolled on wide low-profile performance tires on gorgeous fat 22-inch Forgiato wheels.

Owing to the fact that the stock 2013 GT500 and Mustang GTs lacked for nothing in the power department neither Technosports nor Steeda made any modifications to the motors. In the film’s dialogue however it is suggested that the car packs a completely custom Ford Racing supercharged 5.8-liter V8 that pumps out 900 horsepower.

Inside The Mustang was fairly close to stock. A working heads-up display was added to the dash and the standard Ford infotainment system was replaced with a screen that ran custom graphics tied to the plot of the movie. The rear seats were pulled in favor of a Ford Racing tubular steel x-brace.

Of the eight identical cars created for the film some were aesthetically perfect for close-up hero shots others were used for stunt driving and at least one had a reinforced roof and pillars so it could be hung from a helicopter in a particular scene.

To give credit to Waugh the majority of vehicle stunts in the film were practically performed just like in the beloved car movies of his youth. CGI was only employed when a stunt was physically impossible or just too dangerous to perform. And boy the “Shelby” performs some incredible jumps drifts chases and burnouts in the movie with aplomb.

Through the course of shooting six of the eight cars were completely destroyed performing stunts though Steeda was proud to note that there were no suspension failures. Of the remaining two the actual GT500 was sold in 2014 at the Barrett-Jackson auction to a collector named Dave Flynn for $300000. The proceeds went to benefit the Henry Ford Health Systems charity.

The other a GT was sold to a collector who upon discovering it wasn’t a real GT500 contacted Ford which graciously put a genuine GT500 drivetrain in his collectable free of charge.

While Need for Speed is by no means high art it is entertaining and if for no other reason is worth watching for Carroll Shelby’s “last” Mustang."

Technology stocks have been far from a sure bet since 2021 began its stretch run in mid-November. Inflationary concerns and fears of rising interest rates pushed investors out of software and internet companies sending scores of prior outperformers into correction territory. Despite the sell-off and the volatility across wide swaths of the tech industry investors have made a bundle of money betting on specific companies and stories. Certain areas of the semiconductor market ballooned this year as demand soared for processors that could speed crypto mining aid game development and connect more devices to the internet. Fintech cloud software and cybersecurity had their share of standouts as well even if buying baskets of those stocks and holding them for the year would not have been a particularly lucrative investment. Here are the five biggest gainers in 2021 among U.S. tech companies valued at $5 billion or more. The list excludes companies that went public this year. Prices are as of Thursday's close.

Upstart

When Upstart held its stock market debut in mid-December of last year the company was valued at about $1.5 billion. Just over a year later it's a $12 billion company. Upstart shares are up 264% since the beginning of 2021 including a gain of 171% over a wild three-day stretch in March. The company uses machine learning to underwrite consumer loans and provides its technology to banking partners who can then better target customers. Revenue in the third quarter soared 250% to $228 million. In addition to rapid growth Upstart is giving investors something that's unusual from a newly public tech company: profits. Upstart has generated earnings for five straight quarters including net income of $29.1 million in the latest period up from $9.7 million a year earlier. Upstart said in its earnings call in November that it now provides technology services to 31 banks and credit unions up from 10 a year ago. In the third quarter the company powered 362780 loans up 244% from a year earlier.

CEO David Girouard said on the call that the company is now moving beyond personal and auto loans and into small-dollar loans for consumers with ""immediate cash needs."" ""Our bank partners rightly feel pressured to better serve low-to-moderate income Americans and we want to help them do that right"" Girouard said. ""The interest in the small dollar product from our bank and credit union partners is off the charts and we hope to bring it to market before the end of 2022.""

Synaptics

Synaptics was founded in 1986 and went public 16 years later. But it took until 2020 for investors to start getting excited about the stock. This year it took off soaring 189%. Synaptics grew up in the heart of Silicon Valley developing touchpads and scroll pads for PCs as well as biometrics. Its touch technology then gained resonance with smartphones. Now with more devices acting like computers Synaptics has positioned itself at the center of the ""Internet of Things"" (IoT) boom. The company's technology can be found in connected cars virtual reality headsets set-top boxes drones and gaming systems. It focuses on low-power consumption for all sorts of wireless devices. ""We've done really really well with that business — it's outperformed our best expectations"" CEO Michael Hurlston told CNBC's Jim Cramer in July. ""I think it's because we didn't go after what everybody else was chasing. We repositioned it to go after an interesting market that has turned out to be a great grower."" Earlier this month Synaptics completed its $549 million acquisition of DSP Group which provides voice processing and wireless chipsets.

Asana

Asana CEO Dustin Moskovitz Asana

At its peak in mid-November Asana was up almost five-fold for the year far outpacing all other U.S. tech stocks. It's lost almost half its value since then falling alongside a bunch of other high-priced cloud software stocks. Still the provider of software that helps marketing operations and sales teams manage projects and collaborate remotely is up 164% in 2021 driven by year-over-year revenue growth of at least 70% in the second and third quarters. Like Upstart Asana went public in 2020 but its coming-out party with investors took a few months to get rolling. Dustin Moskovitz the company's billionaire co-founder and CEO has been buying along the way. Moskovitz has purchased about $293 million worth of Asana shares in December taking advantage of the dip to bolster his position. He now controls about 44% of the company's Class A and Class B combined shares up from 36% before the company's New York Stock Exchange debut in September 2020. Converting free users to paying customers is key to Asana's future growth and profitability. In its third-quarter earnings report earlier this month Asana said paying clients increased by 7000 to over 114000 and said revenue from customers spending more than $5000 annually jumped 96% from a year earlier.

Fortinet

With two straight quarters of revenue growth above 30% Fortinet is expanding at its fastest rate since 2016. A flurry of ransomware attacks along with a more complex security environment created by a sudden surge in remote work led to a spike in demand for Fortinet's technology this year. Shares are up 133% closing on Thursday at $349.02. That's lifted the company's market cap past $57 billion surpassing rival Palo Alto Networks  which is valued at $55 billion after its stock climbed 58% in 2021. Following Fortinet's better-than-expected earnings report and upbeat forecast last month analysts at Wedbush increased their price target to $400 from $350. One reason the firm cited was the company's free cash flow which jumped to $329.8 million from $185.7 million a year earlier. ""In a nutshell Billings growth upside strong FCF and a healthy pipeline should be the trifecta to drive this stock higher"" wrote the Wedbush analysts who kept their buy recommendation on the stock.

Nvidia

Nvidia GeForce Now on iPhone Nvidia

Chipmaker Nvidia was the best-performing mega-cap tech stock of the year. The shares soared 127% in 2021 pushing the company's market cap to $741 billion seventh highest among U.S. tech companies behind the five Big Tech names and Tesla . Revenue growth has topped 50% in each of the last five quarters proving that Nvidia's high-performance graphics processing units remain in hot demand. Within the data center Nvidia's technology bolsters artificial intelligence and data-intensive workloads while gaming systems continue to require heftier processing power. Earlier this year Nvidia released new processors specifically for crypto mining. They've generated $526 million in revenue so far but crypto is proving to be a volatile market for Nvidia. The company said last month that sales of the products plunged 60% sequentially from the second quarter to the third and are expected to be ""very negligible"" in the fourth quarter. Investors aren't expressing much concern. The stock climbed more than 8% after the earnings report largely because gaming processors Nvidia's core business generated $2.76 billion in revenue an increase of 106% from last year. ""We continue to believe the company's long-term prospects are some of the best in the semiconductor industry"" analysts from Piper Sandler wrote in a note after third-quarter earnings. They maintained their buy rating and raised their price target to $350 from $260. WATCH: Nvidia could be a $10 trillion stock one day says Jim Cramer",,,,,,,,,,,,

Disney Coca-Cola American Express Bank of America Lowe's and Pfizer faced accusations that they trained employees on certain ""woke"" ideas such as putting ""marginalized"" staff above ""privileged"" staff learning to ""decolonize"" their minds"" and combating aspects of an alleged ""White supremacy culture"" such as perfectionism individualism and objectivity.

These ideas trace back to critical race theory (CRT) — a framework that involves deconstructing aspects of society to discover systemic racism beneath the surface. Current and former employees at American Express told Fox News that the change began after the police-involved killing of George Floyd in May 2020 but the ""woke"" trainings came to light in 2021.

AMERICAN EXPRESS CRT TRAINING URGED STAFF TO ADOPT A HIERARCHY PUTTING ‘MARGINALIZED’ ABOVE ‘PRIVILEGED’

In February a whistleblower at Coca-Cola claimed that the company forced employees to take a seminar teaching them to ""be less white."" The whistleblower posted photos of a seminar giving tips to ""be less white"" including ""be less arrogant be less certain be less defensive be more humble listen believe break with apathy"" and ""break with white solidarity."" The materials claimed that White people in the United States and other western nations are ""socialized to feel that they are inherently superior because they are white.""

Yet Coca-Cola told Fox Business that the slides ""are not part of the company's learning curriculum.""

Coca-Cola President Alfredo Rivera apologized for the situation in March.

""Recently we learned that content accessible through our company training platform did not align with"" being ""respectful for all"" he said.

While this material was not part of the training curriculum Rivera said ""We apologize to those who were offended by this content. We would never encourage anyone to be any less of themselves.""

In March Manhattan Institute Senior Fellow Chris Rufo revealed whistleblower documents from the Walt Disney Company's diversity and inclusion program ""Reimagine Tomorrow."" The program includes multiple training modules on ""antiracism.""

The modules tell employees that they must ""take ownership of educating [themselves] about structural anti-Black racism."" The modules claim that the U.S. has a ""long history of systemic racism and transphobia"" and that White employees must ""work through feelings of guilt shame and defensiveness to understand what is beneath them and what needs to be healed."" Another module encourages employees to reject ""equality"" focusing on ""equal treatment and access to opportunities"" and instead strive for ""equity"" focusing on ""the equality of outcome.""

PFIZER SETS RACE-BASED HIRING GOALS IN THE NAME OF FIGHTING ‘SYSTEMIC RACISM’ ‘GENDER EQUITY CHALLENGES’

Disney did not deny the training but insisted that whistleblowers took it out of context.

""These internal documents are being deliberately distorted as reflective of company policy when in fact their purpose was to allow diversity of thought and discussion on the incredibly complex and challenging issues of race and discrimination that we as a society and companies nationwide are facing"" the company said in a statement.

In August Rufo published internal documents showing that American Express subjected its employees to a series of critical race theory training sessions that encouraged staff to rank themselves on a hierarchy of ""privilege"" and apply that hierarchy in the workplace with the more ""privileged"" employees deferring to staff from ""marginalized groups.""

In the trainings the outside consulting firm Paradigm urged Amex employees to construct their own intersectional identities mapping their ""race sexual orientation body type religion disability status age gender identity [and] citizenship"" on an official company worksheet. Employees could then determine whether they have ""privilege"" or are members of a ""marginalized group."" Whites males heterosexual people Christians able-bodied people and citizens would presumably count as ""privileged.""

The training sessions also warned White employees to avoid certain phrases such as ""I don't see color"" ""We are all human beings"" and ""Everyone can succeed in this society if they work hard enough"" as ""microaggressions.""

In a high-profile ""anti-racism"" event Amex executives invited Khalil Muhammad a great-grandson of Nation of Islam founder Elijah Muhammad to speak on ""race in corporate America."" He argued that capitalism was founded on racism and that ""racist logics and forms of domination"" have shaped Western society since at least the Industrial Revolution. He even argued that the credit card company should reduce standards for Black customers and sacrifice profits in the interest of race-based reparations.

""If American Express cares about racial justice in the world it can’t simply say the market’s going to define how we price certain customers who happen to come from low-income communities"" he said. ""If you want to do good then you’re going to have to set up products and [product] lines that don’t maximize profit.""

AMERICAN EXPRESS ENGAGES IN ‘REVERSE DISCRIMINATION’ AGAINST WHITE PEOPLE CURRENT AND FORMER EMPLOYEES SAY

In September five current and former AmEx employees — speaking on condition of anonymity — told FOX Business that the company singles out Black people for promotion in a practice that former employees described as reverse discrimination against White people. The employees did not present internal documents to demonstrate an official policy but they said they witnessed a worrisome trend that raises questions about racial discrimination in promotion. One former employee said they quit because the critical race theory trainings and the apparent promotion of employees due to skin color sent the message that White employees could not expect to even be considered for promotion.

American Express denied this accusation in a statement.

""We have a high-achieving culture and we are proud of our dedicated and highly engaged colleagues"" an American Express spokesperson told FOX Business. ""Advancement within our company is based solely on individual business and leadership performance. Any characterization of our company and culture to the contrary is just plain wrong.""

The statement also claimed that the company's ""diversity equity and inclusion programs"" focus on upholding a commitment to ""a diverse and inclusive culture where all colleagues feel welcome and heard and have equal opportunities to thrive regardless of their gender race ethnicity age religion sexual orientation and nationality."" The programs ""are not based on any specific theory nor are they directed to a specific group of employees.""

In August Rufo revealed documents showing that Bank of America Lowe's and Truist Financial Corporation sponsored a United Way critical race theory ""Racial Equity 21-Day Challenge"" claiming that America is systemically and institutionally racist encouraging participants to ""decolonize"" their minds and get ""woke at work"" and urging white people to ""cede power to people of color.""

The Racial Equity 21-Day Challenge included a document with responses to potential objections. Should participants ask about reverse discrimination the guide claims that there is no such thing. The document also claims that people of color cannot be racist: ""Racism is used to justify the position of the dominant group White people in this case and to uphold White supremacy and superiority. Everyone can be biased and engage in bigoted and belittling behavior that is intolerant of other perspectives. But racism is by definition a form of oppression exercised by the dominant racial group (Whites).""

BANK OF AMERICA LOWE'S SPONSORED CRT TRAINING URGING WHITES TO ‘CEDE POWER TO PEOPLE OF COLOR’

Bank of America spokesman Bill Haldin told FOX Business that his company does not endorse these ideas and that it does not run its own employee trainings along these lines.

""This was not our program and not our training materials"" he said. ""The United Way ran this program independent of Bank of America and it is not part of our training material.""

Lowe's and Truist Financial did not respond to FOX Business' request for comment.

The pharmaceutical company Pfizer has set goals to fill a percentage of leadership positions with Black and Hispanic candidates by the year 2025 in the name of fighting ""systemic racism."" In September FOX Business reported on an Environmental Social & Governance (ESG) Report 2020  published in March 2021 in which Pfizer set ""opportunity parity goals"" for 2025. Those goals include ""increasing our minority representation from 19% to 32% and doubling the underrepresented population of African Americans/Blacks and Hispanics/Latinos.""

The report includes a letter from Albert Bourla Pfizer's chairman and CEO in which Bourla says he is ""proud"" of having ""set concrete goals to address systemic racism and gender equity challenges by reviewing and augmenting our plans to increase diversity and opportunity parity by 2025 particularly focusing on increasing female and U.S. minority representation at leadership levels.""

""We now have quotas basically in hiring and promotions"" explained a current Pfizer employee who spoke with FOX Business on condition of anonymity. The employee said the company hosted events with Ibram X. Kendi and encouraged employees to read books written by Robin DiAngelo two prominent CRT proponents.

As just about any parent will tell you family entertainment was a sanity-saver in 2021. So it’s a good thing there was so much of it!

The Mouse House was a major contender this year as Disney released features ranging from animated hits like ""Encanto"" and ""Raya and the Last Dragon"" to live-action adventures like ""Jungle Cruise"" and ""Cruella"" to no shortage of superhero spectacle.

But other players entered the family movie game too whether literally playing ball in ""Space Jam: A New Legacy"" or just attending one like Camila Cabello in ""Cinderella."" More gems ranged from quirky stories like ""The Mitchells vs. the Machines"" and ""Nightbooks"" to family-friendly musicals like ""In The Heights"" and ""Vivo.""

In no particular order here are the kids and family movies that defined 2021.

Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson and Emily Blunt in ‘Jungle Cruise’ (Disney+)

Emily Blunt Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson and Jack Whitehall in 'Jungle Cruise'

As with the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" franchise this movie manages about what’s expected of a film version of a goofy amusement park boat ride: It’s a pleasant distraction and is just as likely to float in through one ear and then sail right on out through the other. Adults may find themselves gleefully groaning at the puns or recoiling from the many many snakes. Kids will have even more fun — this is a movie that sneaks in a fart joke before the six-minute mark though some unsettling visual effects mild violence and light innuendo make this a PG-13 film with PG energy. Great cinema it ain’t but if The Rock fist-fighting a jungle cat Emily Blunt swinging on a vine and Jesse Plemons dementedly eating three peas appeals head straight for the X on the map. Rated PG-13. 127 minutes. Dir: Jaume Collet-Serra. Featuring: Dwayne Johnson Emily Blunt Édgar Ramírez Jack Whitehall Jesse Plemons Paul Giamatti.

LeBron James steps into Michael Jordan’s shoes in a hybrid animated/live-action film that features not only the Looney Tunes but just about every character in the expansive Warner Bros. catalogue.

Oh the Mitchells. Producers Phil Miller and Christopher Lord (""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"") dropped a lovable yet seriously dysfunctional family right into a robot apocalypse and in ""The Mitchells vs. the Machines"" Katie Mitchell (Abbi Jacobson) and company more than rose to the occasion. Co-writers Mike Rianda and Jeff Rowe blend pathos and humor as nimbly as the film's several animation styles creating a treat for the eyes ears (courtesy of Mark Mothersbaugh's excellent score) and heart. Oh and it just might make you think twice about welcoming Siri and Alexa into your home courtesy of a deliciously deranged vocal performance from Oscar winner Olivia Colman. Rated PG. Runtime 110.

Lin-Manuel Miranda’s tunes elevate ‘Encanto’ (Disney+)

While most 2021 family films understandably made their debuts on streaming platforms ""Encanto"" aimed to welcome families back to the megaplex with a theatrical-only release. Set in a magical village in Colombia this lushly animated flick follows the one non-magical member of a family blessed with superhuman abilities.

Tom Holland Zendaya and Benedict Cumberbatch in ‘Spider-Man: No Way Home’ (in theaters)

Tom Holland stars as Peter Parker/Spider-Man and Benedict Cumberbatch stars as Doctor Strange in Columbia Pictures' SPIDER-MAN: NO WAY HOME.

What works best about ""No Way Home"" is its sense of surprise – not just in the cameos Easter Eggs and returning characters it offers but also in its bold tonal shifts. It’s a movie that can be subversively playful one minute and deeply somber the next. (It helps that star Tom Holland is just as good at conjuring up empathetic tears as cracking wise.) In fact far from feeling like a trilogy capper ""No Way Home"" seems more like the start of a new era for Peter Parker. One of the movie’s main themes is second chances — something it offers to performers who never quite got their due in past Spider-Man franchises. But that also extends to a fresh start for the MCU’s take on Peter as well. ""No Way Home"" puts the teenage superhero through the wringer in order to bring him closer to his comic book roots. Rated PG-13. 148 minutes. Dir: Jon Watts. Also featuring: Zendaya Jacob Batalon Benedict Cumberbatch Marisa Tomei Jon Favreau Benedict Wong J. K. Simmons Alfred Molina Willem Dafoe Jamie Foxx.

It’s Emma Stone vs. Emma Thompson in ‘Cruella’ (Disney+)

Emma Stone in 'Cruella'

Forget the 101 Dalmations this movie is a story of two Emmas. That’s Emma Stone and Emma Thompson who turn in fabulous performances as respectively aspiring fashion designer Estella (a.k.a. our future Cruella) and her icy boss The Baroness. With a soundtrack of 1960s and ‘70s hits and some truly stunning costume design that ranges from punk to glam this live-action prequel/reimagining of a Disney classic makes for a perfect transitional film for kids and pre-teens looking to expand their tastes with something just a little edgier. Rated PG-13. 134 minutes. Dir: Craig Gillespie. Also featuring: Joel Fry Paul Walter Hauser Emily Beecham Kirby Howell-Baptiste Mark Strong John McCrea.

Camilla Cabello in ‘Cinderella’ (Prime Video)

True this jukebox musical adaptation of ""Cinderella"" isn’t for everyone (including our reviewer) but its colorful music-filled cheekily self-aware vibe makes it perfect for pre-teens. In her first major acting role Camila Cabello has both charisma and comedy chops as the titular fairy tale heroine — who in this version would rather open a small clothing design business than get bogged down by a guy. As with similar projects like ""Glee"" ""The Greatest Showman"" and director Kay Cannon’s ""Pitch Perfect"" series however the musical numbers are the real draw here. And from a fun mash-up of Salt-N-Pepa’s ""Whatta Man"" and The White Stripes’ ""Seven Nation Army"" to Cabello’s catchy original ballad ""Million to One"" to Idina Menzel’s truly fantastic take on Madonna’s ""Material Girl"" ""Cinderella"" will leave your glass toes tapping.

Lin-Manuel Miranda’s ‘In The Heights’ (HBO Max)

Anthony Ramos and Melissa Barrera in ""In the Heights.""

Before Lin-Manuel Miranda became a household name with ""Hamilton"" he burst onto Broadway with this vibrant ode to the Latinx community in Washington Heights. ""In The Heights"" blends a contemporary setting with an old-fashioned musical sensibility to carve out its own unique place in the musical theater canon. And the long-anticipated movie adaptation from director Jon M. Chu (""Crazy Rich Asians"") is just as vibrant and twice as big. Filled with innovatively staged numbers and a charismatic cast of up-and-comers it’s a musical treat as satisfying as an ice-cold piragua on a hot summer day. Rated PG-13. 143 minutes. Dir: Jon M.

In case Lin-Manuel Miranda didn’t have enough on his plate in 2021 — the year he produced ""In The Heights"" directed ""Tick Tick... Boom!"" and wrote the songs for Disney’s ""Encanto"" — he also played a major role in this charming Sony Pictures animated flick too. Miranda voices Vivo a music-loving monkey from Cuba who somewhat reluctantly finds himself on a wacky adventure with a free-spirited young girl named Gabi (Ynairaly Simo). With both goofy humor and heartfelt storytelling ""Vivo"" is a bit of an underrated gem when it comes to 2021 family films. Oh and did we mention that Miranda wrote the movie’s catchy songs too?

Jeff Kinney’s books come to life in ‘Diary of a Wimpy Kid’ (Disney+)

'Diary of a Wimpy Kid'

Perfect for the anxious elementary schooler in your life this sweet breezy animated feature is the latest take on Jeff Kinney’s beloved book series about ""wimpy kid"" Greg Heffley (Brady Noon) and his nerve-wracking first year of middle school. Unlike the four previous live-action adaptations (three of which are also streaming on Disney+) this one deploys a simple CG style that calls to mind Kinney’s signature illustrations. Kinney is onboard as a screenwriter too adapting the first of his 16 books. And while ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" isn’t particularly game-changing in its story or animation style it has some well-observed kid-friendly comedy about the absurdities of middle school. (Think ""Pepper Ann"" more than ""PEN15."") At just about an hour long ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" really feels more like an extended episode of TV than a proper movie. But it’ll make for an enjoyable (if brief) evening of family viewing. Rated PG. 58 minutes. Dir: Swinton Scott.

A different kind of Disney princess flick ""Raya and the Last Dragon"" pulls from the action-adventure genre rather than the classic musical template. The story of a young warrior princess named Raya (Kelly Marie Tran) trying to revive a broken world feels especially poignantly in 2021. With fantasy worldbuilding drawn from traditional Southeast Asian cultures and a great voice performance from Awkwafina as an insecure dragon ""Raya"" brings viewers to a whole new world — even if they’re watching from the comfort of their own homes.

Gonzo gets ghosted in ‘Muppets Haunted Mansion’ (Disney+)

'Muppets Haunted Mansion'

Not all theme park rides work when adapted for the screen — but perhaps that’s not the case when The Muppets are involved. This spooky short and sweet adventure for Gonzo and notable crustacean Pepe the King Prawn is a far more faithful adaptation of its source material (or source experience?) than most of its brethren including ""Jungle Cruise;"" if you’ve been on the Haunted Mansion ride at any of the Disney parks you’re going to recognize a lot of what you see. But it’s all filtered through that joyful goofy Hensonian lens and elevated by a delightfully deranged performance from Will Arnett a modern master of the delightful derangement.

Plus there was ""Ron’s Gone Wrong"" and ""Puff: Wonders of the Reef"" as well as the holiday fun of ""A Boy Called Christmas"" and ""8-Bit Christmas.""

Our critics pick the best of the year

'Encanto' and 'The Mitchells vs. the Machines.'

Allison Shoemaker’s pick: It was a great year for sweet stories in which the heroes don’t feel that they belong — that’s a thread that connects ""Luca"" ""Raya and the Last Dragon"" ""In the Heights"" ""Vivo"" ""Cinderella"" ""Cruella"" ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" ""The Mitchells vs. the Machines: and others. But the two oddballs who won my heart sit at the center of a pair of musicals the exuberant ""Everybody’s Talking About Jamie"" and Disney’s gripping ""Encanto."" The latter’s breathtaking animation and epic scale meant that I especially cherished my time with the magical Madrigal family a group of outrageously talented individuals whose gifts pale in comparison to the powers of empathy community and compassion. (And ""Welcome to the Family Madrigal"" is a bop.)

Caroline Siede’s pick: ""The Mitchells vs. the Machines."" Pretty much everything about ""The Mitchells vs. the Machines"" works from its gonzo sci-fi comedy tone to its wonderfully original animation style. (I haven’t stopped thinking about that Furby sequence all year.) But what really makes this movie sing is its thoughtful look at the kind of everyday father/daughter conflict you rarely see explored onscreen. It’s an emotional core that both grounds and elevates this delightfully over-the-top planet-saving adventure.

Disney Coca-Cola American Express Bank of America Lowe's and Pfizer faced accusations that they trained employees on certain ""woke"" ideas such as putting ""marginalized"" staff above ""privileged"" staff learning to ""decolonize"" their minds"" and combating aspects of an alleged ""White supremacy culture"" such as perfectionism individualism and objectivity.

These ideas trace back to critical race theory (CRT) — a framework that involves deconstructing aspects of society to discover systemic racism beneath the surface. Current and former employees at American Express told Fox News that the change began after the police-involved killing of George Floyd in May 2020 but the ""woke"" trainings came to light in 2021.

AMERICAN EXPRESS CRT TRAINING URGED STAFF TO ADOPT A HIERARCHY PUTTING ‘MARGINALIZED’ ABOVE ‘PRIVILEGED’

In February a whistleblower at Coca-Cola claimed that the company forced employees to take a seminar teaching them to ""be less white."" The whistleblower posted photos of a seminar giving tips to ""be less white"" including ""be less arrogant be less certain be less defensive be more humble listen believe break with apathy"" and ""break with white solidarity."" The materials claimed that White people in the United States and other western nations are ""socialized to feel that they are inherently superior because they are white.""

Yet Coca-Cola told Fox Business that the slides ""are not part of the company's learning curriculum.""

Coca-Cola President Alfredo Rivera apologized for the situation in March.

""Recently we learned that content accessible through our company training platform did not align with"" being ""respectful for all"" he said.

While this material was not part of the training curriculum Rivera said ""We apologize to those who were offended by this content. We would never encourage anyone to be any less of themselves.""

In March Manhattan Institute Senior Fellow Chris Rufo revealed whistleblower documents from the Walt Disney Company's diversity and inclusion program ""Reimagine Tomorrow."" The program includes multiple training modules on ""antiracism.""

The modules tell employees that they must ""take ownership of educating [themselves] about structural anti-Black racism."" The modules claim that the U.S. has a ""long history of systemic racism and transphobia"" and that White employees must ""work through feelings of guilt shame and defensiveness to understand what is beneath them and what needs to be healed."" Another module encourages employees to reject ""equality"" focusing on ""equal treatment and access to opportunities"" and instead strive for ""equity"" focusing on ""the equality of outcome.""

PFIZER SETS RACE-BASED HIRING GOALS IN THE NAME OF FIGHTING ‘SYSTEMIC RACISM’ ‘GENDER EQUITY CHALLENGES’

Disney did not deny the training but insisted that whistleblowers took it out of context.

Ticker Security Last Change Change % DIS THE WALT DISNEY CO. 105.80 +0.02 +0.02%

""These internal documents are being deliberately distorted as reflective of company policy when in fact their purpose was to allow diversity of thought and discussion on the incredibly complex and challenging issues of race and discrimination that we as a society and companies nationwide are facing"" the company said in a statement.

In August Rufo published internal documents showing that American Express subjected its employees to a series of critical race theory training sessions that encouraged staff to rank themselves on a hierarchy of ""privilege"" and apply that hierarchy in the workplace with the more ""privileged"" employees deferring to staff from ""marginalized groups.""

In the trainings the outside consulting firm Paradigm urged Amex employees to construct their own intersectional identities mapping their ""race sexual orientation body type religion disability status age gender identity [and] citizenship"" on an official company worksheet. Employees could then determine whether they have ""privilege"" or are members of a ""marginalized group."" Whites males heterosexual people Christians able-bodied people and citizens would presumably count as ""privileged.""

The training sessions also warned White employees to avoid certain phrases such as ""I don't see color"" ""We are all human beings"" and ""Everyone can succeed in this society if they work hard enough"" as ""microaggressions.""

In a high-profile ""anti-racism"" event Amex executives invited Khalil Muhammad a great-grandson of Nation of Islam founder Elijah Muhammad to speak on ""race in corporate America."" He argued that capitalism was founded on racism and that ""racist logics and forms of domination"" have shaped Western society since at least the Industrial Revolution. He even argued that the credit card company should reduce standards for Black customers and sacrifice profits in the interest of race-based reparations.

""If American Express cares about racial justice in the world it can’t simply say the market’s going to define how we price certain customers who happen to come from low-income communities"" he said. ""If you want to do good then you’re going to have to set up products and [product] lines that don’t maximize profit.""

AMERICAN EXPRESS ENGAGES IN ‘REVERSE DISCRIMINATION’ AGAINST WHITE PEOPLE CURRENT AND FORMER EMPLOYEES SAY

In September five current and former AmEx employees — speaking on condition of anonymity — told FOX Business that the company singles out Black people for promotion in a practice that former employees described as reverse discrimination against White people. The employees did not present internal documents to demonstrate an official policy but they said they witnessed a worrisome trend that raises questions about racial discrimination in promotion. One former employee said they quit because the critical race theory trainings and the apparent promotion of employees due to skin color sent the message that White employees could not expect to even be considered for promotion.

American Express denied this accusation in a statement.

""We have a high-achieving culture and we are proud of our dedicated and highly engaged colleagues"" an American Express spokesperson told FOX Business. ""Advancement within our company is based solely on individual business and leadership performance. Any characterization of our company and culture to the contrary is just plain wrong.""

The statement also claimed that the company's ""diversity equity and inclusion programs"" focus on upholding a commitment to ""a diverse and inclusive culture where all colleagues feel welcome and heard and have equal opportunities to thrive regardless of their gender race ethnicity age religion sexual orientation and nationality."" The programs ""are not based on any specific theory nor are they directed to a specific group of employees.""

In August Rufo revealed documents showing that Bank of America Lowe's and Truist Financial Corporation sponsored a United Way critical race theory ""Racial Equity 21-Day Challenge"" claiming that America is systemically and institutionally racist encouraging participants to ""decolonize"" their minds and get ""woke at work"" and urging white people to ""cede power to people of color.""

The Racial Equity 21-Day Challenge included a document with responses to potential objections. Should participants ask about reverse discrimination the guide claims that there is no such thing. The document also claims that people of color cannot be racist: ""Racism is used to justify the position of the dominant group White people in this case and to uphold White supremacy and superiority. Everyone can be biased and engage in bigoted and belittling behavior that is intolerant of other perspectives. But racism is by definition a form of oppression exercised by the dominant racial group (Whites).""

BANK OF AMERICA LOWE'S SPONSORED CRT TRAINING URGING WHITES TO ‘CEDE POWER TO PEOPLE OF COLOR’

Bank of America spokesman Bill Haldin told FOX Business that his company does not endorse these ideas and that it does not run its own employee trainings along these lines.

""This was not our program and not our training materials"" he said. ""The United Way ran this program independent of Bank of America and it is not part of our training material.""

Lowe's and Truist Financial did not respond to FOX Business' request for comment.

The pharmaceutical company Pfizer has set goals to fill a percentage of leadership positions with Black and Hispanic candidates by the year 2025 in the name of fighting ""systemic racism."" In September FOX Business reported on an Environmental Social & Governance (ESG) Report 2020  published in March 2021 in which Pfizer set ""opportunity parity goals"" for 2025. Those goals include ""increasing our minority representation from 19% to 32% and doubling the underrepresented population of African Americans/Blacks and Hispanics/Latinos.""

The report includes a letter from Albert Bourla Pfizer's chairman and CEO in which Bourla says he is ""proud"" of having ""set concrete goals to address systemic racism and gender equity challenges by reviewing and augmenting our plans to increase diversity and opportunity parity by 2025 particularly focusing on increasing female and U.S. minority representation at leadership levels.""

""We now have quotas basically in hiring and promotions"" explained a current Pfizer employee who spoke with FOX Business on condition of anonymity. The employee said the company hosted events with Ibram X. Kendi and encouraged employees to read books written by Robin DiAngelo two prominent CRT proponents.

As just about any parent will tell you family entertainment was a sanity-saver in 2021. So it’s a good thing there was so much of it!

The Mouse House was a major contender this year as Disney released features ranging from animated hits like ""Encanto"" and ""Raya and the Last Dragon"" to live-action adventures like ""Jungle Cruise"" and ""Cruella"" to no shortage of superhero spectacle.

But other players entered the family movie game too whether literally playing ball in ""Space Jam: A New Legacy"" or just attending one like Camila Cabello in ""Cinderella."" More gems ranged from quirky stories like ""The Mitchells vs. the Machines"" and ""Nightbooks"" to family-friendly musicals like ""In The Heights"" and ""Vivo.""

In no particular order here are the kids and family movies that defined 2021.

Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson and Emily Blunt in ‘Jungle Cruise’ (Disney+)

Emily Blunt Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson and Jack Whitehall in 'Jungle Cruise'

As with the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" franchise this movie manages about what’s expected of a film version of a goofy amusement park boat ride: It’s a pleasant distraction and is just as likely to float in through one ear and then sail right on out through the other. Adults may find themselves gleefully groaning at the puns or recoiling from the many many snakes. Kids will have even more fun — this is a movie that sneaks in a fart joke before the six-minute mark though some unsettling visual effects mild violence and light innuendo make this a PG-13 film with PG energy. Great cinema it ain’t but if The Rock fist-fighting a jungle cat Emily Blunt swinging on a vine and Jesse Plemons dementedly eating three peas appeals head straight for the X on the map. Rated PG-13. 127 minutes. Dir: Jaume Collet-Serra. Featuring: Dwayne Johnson Emily Blunt Édgar Ramírez Jack Whitehall Jesse Plemons Paul Giamatti.

LeBron James in ‘Space Jam: A New Legacy’ (HBO Max)

LeBron James and Bugs Bunny in 'Space Jam: a New Legacy'

It’s a pitch so obvious it’s kind of remarkable it hasn’t been done until now: Take the most popular basketball player of the day and cast them in a legacy sequel to the ’90s classic ""Space Jam."" LeBron James steps into Michael Jordan’s shoes in a hybrid animated/live-action film that features not only the Looney Tunes but just about every character in the expansive Warner Bros. catalogue.

Olivia Colman schemes in ‘The Mitchells vs. The Machines’ (Netflix)

THE MITCHELLS VS. THE MACHINES - (L-R) Mike Rianda as ""Aaron Mitchell"" Danny McBride as ""Rick Mitchell"" Abbi Jacobson as ""Katie Mitchell"" and Maya Rudolph as ""Linda Mitchell"". Cr: ©2021 SPAI. All Rights Reserved.

Oh the Mitchells. Producers Phil Miller and Christopher Lord (""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"") dropped a lovable yet seriously dysfunctional family right into a robot apocalypse and in ""The Mitchells vs. the Machines"" Katie Mitchell (Abbi Jacobson) and company more than rose to the occasion. Co-writers Mike Rianda and Jeff Rowe blend pathos and humor as nimbly as the film's several animation styles creating a treat for the eyes ears (courtesy of Mark Mothersbaugh's excellent score) and heart. Oh and it just might make you think twice about welcoming Siri and Alexa into your home courtesy of a deliciously deranged vocal performance from Oscar winner Olivia Colman. Rated PG. Runtime 110.

Lin-Manuel Miranda’s tunes elevate ‘Encanto’ (Disney+)

Mirabel Madrigal struggles to fit in a family where everyone has been blessed with magical powers - everyone but her. Determined to prove she belongs within this extraordinary family she strives to contribute in meaningful ways—denying to everyone Expand

While most 2021 family films understandably made their debuts on streaming platforms ""Encanto"" aimed to welcome families back to the megaplex with a theatrical-only release. Set in a magical village in Colombia this lushly animated flick follows the one non-magical member of a family blessed with superhuman abilities. Featuring toe-tapping songs by Lin-Manuel Miranda and a story that evokes the South American tradition of magical realism ""Encanto"" expands the grand Disney tradition to include a whole new kind of family.

Tom Holland Zendaya and Benedict Cumberbatch in ‘Spider-Man: No Way Home’ (in theaters)

Tom Holland stars as Peter Parker/Spider-Man and Benedict Cumberbatch stars as Doctor Strange in Columbia Pictures' SPIDER-MAN: NO WAY HOME.

What works best about ""No Way Home"" is its sense of surprise – not just in the cameos Easter Eggs and returning characters it offers but also in its bold tonal shifts. It’s a movie that can be subversively playful one minute and deeply somber the next. (It helps that star Tom Holland is just as good at conjuring up empathetic tears as cracking wise.) In fact far from feeling like a trilogy capper ""No Way Home"" seems more like the start of a new era for Peter Parker. One of the movie’s main themes is second chances — something it offers to performers who never quite got their due in past Spider-Man franchises. But that also extends to a fresh start for the MCU’s take on Peter as well. ""No Way Home"" puts the teenage superhero through the wringer in order to bring him closer to his comic book roots. Rated PG-13. 148 minutes. Dir: Jon Watts. Also featuring: Zendaya Jacob Batalon Benedict Cumberbatch Marisa Tomei Jon Favreau Benedict Wong J. K. Simmons Alfred Molina Willem Dafoe Jamie Foxx.

It’s Emma Stone vs. Emma Thompson in ‘Cruella’ (Disney+)

Emma Stone in 'Cruella'

Forget the 101 Dalmations this movie is a story of two Emmas. That’s Emma Stone and Emma Thompson who turn in fabulous performances as respectively aspiring fashion designer Estella (a.k.a. our future Cruella) and her icy boss The Baroness. With a soundtrack of 1960s and ‘70s hits and some truly stunning costume design that ranges from punk to glam this live-action prequel/reimagining of a Disney classic makes for a perfect transitional film for kids and pre-teens looking to expand their tastes with something just a little edgier. Rated PG-13. 134 minutes. Dir: Craig Gillespie. Also featuring: Joel Fry Paul Walter Hauser Emily Beecham Kirby Howell-Baptiste Mark Strong John McCrea.

Explore the shore with Pixar’s ‘Luca’ (Disney+)

""Luca."" Photo: Disney+.

Perhaps the sweetest gentlest film Pixar has ever made ""Luca"" is a nostalgic story of friendship set in the lush Italian Riviera. Desperate for adventure young sea monsters Luca (Jacob Tremblay) and Alberto (Jack Dylan Grazer) disguise themselves as humans and form a makeshift family with spunky Giulia (Emma Berman) and her gruff dad Massimo (Marco Barricelli). This story of outsiders trying to fit in can be read in any number of ways. And ""Luca"" serves as a welcome reminder about the courage it takes to face your fears and tell them ""Silenzio Bruno!""

Camilla Cabello in ‘Cinderella’ (Prime Video)

Camila Cabello and Billy Porter star in CINDERELLA Courtesy of Amazon Studios © 2021 Amazon Content Services LLC

True this jukebox musical adaptation of ""Cinderella"" isn’t for everyone (including our reviewer) but its colorful music-filled cheekily self-aware vibe makes it perfect for pre-teens. In her first major acting role Camila Cabello has both charisma and comedy chops as the titular fairy tale heroine — who in this version would rather open a small clothing design business than get bogged down by a guy. As with similar projects like ""Glee"" ""The Greatest Showman"" and director Kay Cannon’s ""Pitch Perfect"" series however the musical numbers are the real draw here. And from a fun mash-up of Salt-N-Pepa’s ""Whatta Man"" and The White Stripes’ ""Seven Nation Army"" to Cabello’s catchy original ballad ""Million to One"" to Idina Menzel’s truly fantastic take on Madonna’s ""Material Girl"" ""Cinderella"" will leave your glass toes tapping. Rated PG. 113 minutes. Dir: Kay Cannon. Also featuring: Billy Porter Nicholas Galitzine Pierce Brosnan Minnie Driver Maddie Baillo Charlotte Spencer James Corden.

Lin-Manuel Miranda’s ‘In The Heights’ (HBO Max)

Anthony Ramos and Melissa Barrera in ""In the Heights.""

Before Lin-Manuel Miranda became a household name with ""Hamilton"" he burst onto Broadway with this vibrant ode to the Latinx community in Washington Heights. ""In The Heights"" blends a contemporary setting with an old-fashioned musical sensibility to carve out its own unique place in the musical theater canon. And the long-anticipated movie adaptation from director Jon M. Chu (""Crazy Rich Asians"") is just as vibrant and twice as big. Filled with innovatively staged numbers and a charismatic cast of up-and-comers it’s a musical treat as satisfying as an ice-cold piragua on a hot summer day. Rated PG-13. 143 minutes. Dir: Jon M. Chu. Featuring: Anthony Ramos Corey Hawkins Leslie Grace Melissa Barrera Olga Merediz Daphne Rubin-Vega Gregory Diaz IV Jimmy Smits.

Yet more Lin-Manuel Miranda in ‘Vivo’ (Netflix)

VIVO - (R-L) GABI (voiced by Ynairaly Simo) and VIVO (voiced by Lin-Manuel Miranda). ©2021 SPAI. All Rights Reserved.

In case Lin-Manuel Miranda didn’t have enough on his plate in 2021 — the year he produced ""In The Heights"" directed ""Tick Tick... Boom!"" and wrote the songs for Disney’s ""Encanto"" — he also played a major role in this charming Sony Pictures animated flick too. Miranda voices Vivo a music-loving monkey from Cuba who somewhat reluctantly finds himself on a wacky adventure with a free-spirited young girl named Gabi (Ynairaly Simo). With both goofy humor and heartfelt storytelling ""Vivo"" is a bit of an underrated gem when it comes to 2021 family films. Oh and did we mention that Miranda wrote the movie’s catchy songs too? Rated PG. 95 minutes. Dir: Kirk DeMicco. Also featuring the voices of:Zoe Saldana Brian Tyree Henry Gloria Estefan Michael Rooker Nicole Byer.

Jeff Kinney’s books come to life in ‘Diary of a Wimpy Kid’ (Disney+)

'Diary of a Wimpy Kid'

Perfect for the anxious elementary schooler in your life this sweet breezy animated feature is the latest take on Jeff Kinney’s beloved book series about ""wimpy kid"" Greg Heffley (Brady Noon) and his nerve-wracking first year of middle school. Unlike the four previous live-action adaptations (three of which are also streaming on Disney+) this one deploys a simple CG style that calls to mind Kinney’s signature illustrations. Kinney is onboard as a screenwriter too adapting the first of his 16 books. And while ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" isn’t particularly game-changing in its story or animation style it has some well-observed kid-friendly comedy about the absurdities of middle school. (Think ""Pepper Ann"" more than ""PEN15."") At just about an hour long ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" really feels more like an extended episode of TV than a proper movie. But it’ll make for an enjoyable (if brief) evening of family viewing. Rated PG. 58 minutes. Dir: Swinton Scott. Also featuring the voices of: Ethan William Childress Chris Diamantopoulos Hunter Dillon Christian ConveryErica Cerra.

""Raya and the Last Dragon."" Image: Disney+.

A different kind of Disney princess flick ""Raya and the Last Dragon"" pulls from the action-adventure genre rather than the classic musical template. The story of a young warrior princess named Raya (Kelly Marie Tran) trying to revive a broken world feels especially poignantly in 2021. With fantasy worldbuilding drawn from traditional Southeast Asian cultures and a great voice performance from Awkwafina as an insecure dragon ""Raya"" brings viewers to a whole new world — even if they’re watching from the comfort of their own homes. Rated PG. 107 minutes. Dir: Don Hall Carlos López Estrada. Also featuring the voices of: Gemma Chan Daniel Dae Kim Benedict Wong Sandra Oh Lucille SoongAlan Tudyk.

With catchy songs pulled from the hit West End stage show and a cast of tremendously likable British actors it's a funny sweet feel-good anthem to being yourself.

Gonzo gets ghosted in ‘Muppets Haunted Mansion’ (Disney+)

'Muppets Haunted Mansion'

Not all theme park rides work when adapted for the screen — but perhaps that’s not the case when The Muppets are involved. This spooky short and sweet adventure for Gonzo and notable crustacean Pepe the King Prawn is a far more faithful adaptation of its source material (or source experience?) than most of its brethren including ""Jungle Cruise;"" if you’ve been on the Haunted Mansion ride at any of the Disney parks you’re going to recognize a lot of what you see. But it’s all filtered through that joyful goofy Hensonian lens and elevated by a delightfully deranged performance from Will Arnett a modern master of the delightful derangement.

Rated TV-PG. 52 minutes. Dir: Kirk Thatcher. Featuring: The Muppets alongside Will Arnett Yvette Nicole Brown Darren Criss Taraji P. Henson and John Stamos.

Plus there was ""Ron’s Gone Wrong"" and ""Puff: Wonders of the Reef"" as well as the holiday fun of ""A Boy Called Christmas"" and ""8-Bit Christmas.""

Our critics pick the best of the year

'Encanto' and 'The Mitchells vs. the Machines.'

Allison Shoemaker’s pick: It was a great year for sweet stories in which the heroes don’t feel that they belong — that’s a thread that connects ""Luca"" ""Raya and the Last Dragon"" ""In the Heights"" ""Vivo"" ""Cinderella"" ""Cruella"" ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" ""The Mitchells vs. the Machines: and others. But the two oddballs who won my heart sit at the center of a pair of musicals the exuberant ""Everybody’s Talking About Jamie"" and Disney’s gripping ""Encanto."" The latter’s breathtaking animation and epic scale meant that I especially cherished my time with the magical Madrigal family a group of outrageously talented individuals whose gifts pale in comparison to the powers of empathy community and compassion. (And ""Welcome to the Family Madrigal"" is a bop.)

Caroline Siede’s pick: ""The Mitchells vs. the Machines."" Pretty much everything about ""The Mitchells vs. the Machines"" works from its gonzo sci-fi comedy tone to its wonderfully original animation style. (I haven’t stopped thinking about that Furby sequence all year.) But what really makes this movie sing is its thoughtful look at the kind of everyday father/daughter conflict you rarely see explored onscreen. It’s an emotional core that both grounds and elevates this delightfully over-the-top planet-saving adventure.

On December 4 the Oklahoma State commit ran 16:03.93 to win the Garmin RunningLane Cross Country Championships in Huntsville Alabama. Then on December 11 she tackled the hills of the 5K course at Balboa Park in San Diego in 17:15 winning the Eastbay Cross Country Championships (formerly the Foot Locker Cross-Country Championships).

By winning both Cook has become the undisputed 2021 high-school cross-country champion. Among a list of past winners that includes Olympians NCAA champions and record holders she is the first girl to ever win the national double.



“I’m very happy and proud about the performance” Cook told Runner’s World. “I look back at it now and I think wow that was a big accomplishment and I’m very happy to finish my season off like that.”

A few days after Cook’s double she sat down with Runner’s World to discuss her historic performances the growth she’s experienced this year and goals for the future.

Winning both was a surprise

After claiming the region and Texas state championships earlier in the season Natalie said her dad Flower Mound head coach Andrew Cook encouraged her to “run your best” at the national level.

“I went in with some confidence from state so I thought I had a chance but I didn’t know exactly because I never raced some of [the other runners] before” Cook said.

After finishing third to California runners Dalia Frias and Samantha McDonnell at the Woodbridge Cross-Country Classic in Irvine California in September Cook demolished the Garmin RunningLane field winning by 19 seconds. In the same race Frias placed fifth and McDonnell finished sixth overall.

A week later when Cook learned she became the first woman to win both championships she was speechless.

“I didn’t know I could do that … I wouldn’t have been able to do it without my parents and my teammates” she said while sharing the uplifting text messages they sent her before the race. “The support goes a long way. I was hearing my dad and mom the whole entire time while I was racing and that really helped push me to finish higher because [the] East Bay [course] was very rough in my opinion. The second lap was not fun.”

Stephen Spillman Natalie Cook (third from left) and her Flower Mound teammates.

She’s seen a lot of growth this year

Over the last year Cook has made a big jump in performances by adjusting her training. She attributes that growth to becoming more mature as a runner and realizing the necessary work she needs to put in in order to stay healthy.

Earlier in her career Cook kept getting injured running 30 to 40 miles every week. To prevent injuries this year she decreased her mileage to 15 to 20 miles per week and added low-impact cross-training workouts on the bike and elliptical.

“I used to be really stressed all the time because I was always injured” she said. “But I feel like I’m in a better mindset now that I’m healthy and figured out what to do.”

To stay motivated while putting in long sessions on the stationary machines Cook focused on her goals for the season.

“Mentally it can be really hard on you” Cook said. “I found a way. [I remembered] what am I working for? What’s the goal? That helped.”

She overcame race anxiety

During her sophomore year Cook started to feel anxious before races. The performances of her freshman year—which included a runner-up finish in the 3200 meters and a fifth-place finish in cross country at the Texas state meet—made her feel added pressure to perform better than before. After months of dealing with sleepless nights and bouts of stress before competitions Cook learned to cope by opening up to her parents who offered support.

“I just learned to take a step back and think it’s just a race” she said. “This race is not going to determine how good you are as a runner. There are going to be plenty of other races. I just had to tell myself I’m running because I like it. I enjoy running. I’m not running to stress myself out.”

Other than having a short discussion with her dad the day before a race Cook doesn't spend too much time focusing on the competition until she gets to the start line. “I think that helps me stay nice and calm in general” she said.

Good communication helps her manage school and racing

With the academic demand of her senior year and a race schedule that has taken her all over the country Cook has learned to be overly communicative with her teachers. Before she leaves for a competition Cook lets her teachers know well in advance and prioritizes getting her assignments done before the meet.

“I make sure [all assignments are in] on time and I’ll email my teachers [about] what’s going on if I get stressed out about something” she said. “They usually understand.”

She’s carrying on a family tradition

Cook comes from a family of runners. Her mom Melissa finished 23rd at the 1997 Foot Locker Championships and went on to run for Texas A&M where she became an eight-time All American. As a pro Melissa competed in the U.S. Olympic Track and Field Trials in 2004 2008 and 2012.

Cook’s father Andrew who also ran for Texas A&M would sometimes take Natalie out for short two-mile runs in their neighborhood when she was a kid. “It was a very slow plod but I really enjoyed it” Cook said.

The early introduction sparked Natalie’s love for the sport and created several fun reunions at the Eastbay championships. Natalie witnessed her mom running into her former college rival Sara Slattery and several other pros including Shalane Flanagan and Molly Huddle. Flanagan and Huddle who competed against Melissa on the pro circuit held the finish line tape for Natalie. “I thought that was really cool” Natalie said.

In her senior season she also has big goals on the track

With her last high school track season coming up Cook is aiming to lower her personal bests. She’d like to break 10 minutes in the 2-mile and run faster than her current personal best of 4:43 (from a time trial) in the 1600 meters. She is also considering the possibility of running a 5K on the track this spring.

Next year the program will become even deeper with the addition of the top recruit in the country. And she’s aiming to be a big contributor on the Cowgirls’ roster.

This year’s set of cybersecurity predictions touches on the expected growth of privacy laws and ransomware regulations throughout the world changes to corporate security structures and even a warning of the first uses of operational technology to cause human casualties.

The consultancy’s annual predictions are not always 100% on the mark for example downplaying the prevalence of zero day attacks in its set of predictions for the present day that were published back in 2017. The firm does tend to be on top of general trends however anticipating increased interest in things such as automated AI security defenses and cloud visibility tools (along with correctly naming the year in which the first death directly attributable to a cybersecurity failure occurred).

Cybersecurity predictions see major shake-ups to organizational cybersecurity structure

The majority of this year’s cybersecurity predictions concern what organizations will look like going forward given the present trends in the threat landscape.

In addition to threat trends these changes will be driven by the increasing adoption of data privacy and security regulations around the world. Gartner’s cybersecurity predictions see 75% of the world’s population being covered by privacy laws (either at the national or state/local level) in just two years. Gartner is actually increasing its confidence in this prediction; last year the firm said the same thing about 2023 but called for only 65% of the world to be covered. At present about 130 legal jurisdictions around the world have data privacy laws. A national-level law in the United States is the one big holdout that remains but individual states are increasingly filling in this gap by passing their own laws; Virginia and Colorado have recently passed bills that will go into enforcement at the start of 2023.

Another issue that developed fairly recently that will have a big impact on organizational IT structure going forward is the rise of remote work. Gartner’s cybersecurity predictions see businesses and other entities turning to mesh architectures in a big way with these systems reducing the financial impact of attacks by an average of 90%. These systems focus on device-level security giving each its own standardized set of defense tools to quickly and reliably secure otherwise unpredictable employee devices being used outside of the office. They are also a key element of the “zero trust architecture” trend something that even the US government has embraced and expects to have in place for federal agencies by 2024.

The cybersecurity predictions also see organizations trending in the direction of “security as a service” but looking for all of these various services to be provided by one vendor. Gartner thinks that 30% of enterprises will have adopted a cloud-centered security approach by 2024 looking to trusted vendors that can bundle piles of various tools into one simplified package: Secure Web Gateway (SWG) Cloud Access Security Brokers (CASB) Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) and Firewall As A Service (FWaaS) capabilities among the primary points of interest.

Cybersecurity risk is also going to become a deciding factor in who organizations choose to do business with at least according to Gartner. The cybersecurity predictions see security posture of a potential partner (or acquisition target) being a deciding factor in this area for 60% of businesses.

C-suites and boards of directors will also be doing things a little differently. By 2025 Gartner sees 40% of boards having a dedicated cybersecurity committee overseen by a qualified board member. Additionally 70% of CEOs will mandate a culture of organizational resilience to survive coincident threats from cybercrime as well as other major risks of damage (such as natural disaster and civil unrest).

Increased crackdowns on ransomware payments

Though at the moment the position of most world governments is to allow companies to make ransomware payments if they determine it to be in their best interest this could change quickly over the next four years. By the end of 2025 Gartner’s cybersecurity predictions expect 30% of nations to pass laws tightly regulating ransomware payments; this would be up from less than 1% at the moment. This may be driven in part by an anticipated failure to regulate cryptocurrency with it remaining as a viable way for criminals to extract payments from victims.

Weaponized operational technology may cause human casualties

The most grim entry in the 2021 cybersecurity predictions is that the first human casualties from a hack of operational technology systems will be seen by 2025. Gartner was accurate in its previous prediction of this nature which said that the first cybersecurity failure ending in a fatality would happen by 2020; this very thing happened in Germany that year when the compromise of a hospital’s systems led to the death of an emergency patient that had to be redirected to another facility.

This follows a prediction from the US Department of Homeland Security Secretary that “killware” would soon be emerging as a leading cybersecurity threat. This malware would focus on penetrating industrial operations medical facilities and utilities. Should this become a hacking trend Gartner sees CEOs and executives being held personally responsible and liable for the damage.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmt0bnYuY29tL25ld3Mvd2ludGVyLXN0b3JtLWJyaW5ncy0xNS1pbmNoZXMtb2YtbmV3LXNub3ctdG8tbGVlLWNhbnlvbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Winter storm brings 15 inches of new snow to Lee Canyon,"LAS VEGAS (KTNV) — A winter storm that moved through the Las Vegas valley before Christmas brought several inches of snow to the mountains.

By reducing the time required of medical professionals to review radiology reports Ezra’s new solution also produces cost savings that can be passed along to the patient.

This announcement comes on the heels of Ezra’s momentous company growth as the leading full-body cancer screening service. The company has launched its breakthrough full body MRI screening service in four cities across 16 imaging facilities and is looking to expand nationwide in 2022.

Over a hundred physicians particularly those focused on longevity and anti-aging have integrated Ezra full body scans into their service offerings to their patients.

“The Ezra Report provides a great synopsis for my patients to easily digest their scan results fostering an easier conversation around their treatment plan” said Jake Deutsch M.D. a celebrity doctor in New York who recently began offering Ezra Scans to his Oakwood patients. “The quick turnaround time coupled with the simplicity of the report helps my patients to feel proactive about their long-term health goals at Oakwood.”

With its newly trained machine learning-based software Ezra has created a seamless system in which radiology reports are processed analyzed and a medical report is generated. The proprietary technology pinpoints specific findings in a radiology report maps them to non-technical easily understood translations and transports these results to be subsequently reviewed and verified by medical professionals. This machine learning solution uses over one thousand data points of clinical data from Ezra’s existing internal medical provider team to suggest translations for the radiology report findings. The output is a non-technical and easy to understand medical report of a patient’s radiology results from an Ezra full body MRI scan.

Ezra Reporter will enable the company to decrease the scan-to-report waiting times from 7 business days to only 3 days. This enables patients to get peace of mind in an otherwise nerve-wracking process.

“Ezra Reporter is helping our members better understand their clinical results empowering them to make direct and pertinent decisions about their health” said Diego Cantor co-founder and CTO of Ezra who holds a Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering “Furthermore this AI helps us reduce internal costs making our full body cancer screening service more affordable for our members.”

Ezra aims to implement artificial intelligence into all aspects of its screening service providing accessible and democratized care to all of its members. The use of technology in radiology mitigates countless unnecessary follow-up appointments long wait times and unnecessary stress in an already stressful time for patients. Through this marquee development in Ezra’s technology the company aims to help its members save on costs and time and streamline future care.

At its launch the model quickly made waves with its “Titanium Virtual Armor” aesthetic influenced by the world of virtual reality and the animé genre Mecha. Now G-Shock is doubling down on the former of these two themes with the launch of the Virtual World collection trio of watches that showcase a striking virtual reality theme.

The new collection includes the GA2100VB-1A GA700VB-1Aand GA900VB-1A each taking a base design from one of three popular G-Shock references currently being produced — the GA2100 GA700 and GA900. While each of the models is similar to previous designs produced by the Japanese brand they are nonetheless distinct in their colorways and inspirations mixing dark elements with electric blues purples and pinks all aiming for a futuristic look likely to appeal to younger digital-native customers.

The colorway is most reminiscent of so-called “bisexual lighting” (it’s a real thing I promise) particularly popular in film and television over the past few years or so and likely best known as the color style in HBO’s Euphoria (see below). While best known by this name the unique colorway finds its roots within expansive Gen-Z digital spheres some of which include the virtual reality spaces from which the watches draw their primary inspiration. from. That G-Shock has taken note of this somewhat niche colorway speaks not only to the Virtual World’s intrigue but further to the watch’s target demographic which likely skews younger and within these digital communities.

Outside of the eye-catching colors each of the watches is a true G-Shock at its core with a built-tough case design featuring hard resin and carbon core guard structure and packed with plenty of useful functions that vary by watch but include alarms chronographs countdown timers and more. Each of the models notably uses hybrid analog/digital displays straying from the G-Shock’s traditional all-digital look and perhaps anticipating more models in this style.

Each model within G-Shock’s Virtual World collection is available now directly from the brand and through its authorized dealers. Prices start as low as $99 for the GA2100VB-1A and come in at $110 and $140 for the GA700VB-1A and GA900VB-1A respectively.

TikTok Instagram or YouTube? Which social network is currently the most-used by young Americans? A study looked at social media usage among Generation Z and Millennials and how this usage has changed in 2021. The results of the two rankings might not be what you expect...



Against all odds YouTube leads the way among Gen Zers in the United States. In a study conducted by YPulse* Gen Z usage of the video platform stood at 77% more than for any other social network. Despite taking first place Gen Z YouTube usage is down slightly from its 2020 figure of 79%. Moreover Generation Z remained addicted to Instagram in 2021 with a usage rate of 67% up from 62% in 2020. TikTok is the only social network to show significant growth with 64% of young Americans using the Chinese platform compared to 45% in 2020.





Generation Z (% October 2021/October 2020)



Millennials (% October 2021/October 2020)

The study suggests that YouTube's popularity among Generation Z in the United States could be down to its practical useful nature. While young Americans report spending an average of four hours a day on social media by their own estimations they are not only using YouTube for entertainment but also to learn new things. The relative age of social networks like YouTube and Instagram and their influence among brands may also explain their positions in this ranking. Despite this TikTok's growth remains much stronger and even leads the Chinese giant to outstrip Snapchat.This strong growth in usage is also seen in Generation Y—the Millennials. However while TikTok shows healthy progression the Chinese social network only comes seventh in this particular usage ranking with 42% in 2021 compared to 30% in 2020. Facebook remains top of the list for Millennials with usage at 75% in 2021 versus 76% in 2020 for Mark Zuckerberg's platform.

The WWE Universal Champion was wrestling at a house show earlier this week when a fan shouted from the audience: ""Roman I loved you in Aquaman.""

The Tribal Chief then quickly responded: ""It would've made more money if I was in it too!""

Despite the lack of Reigns Aquaman did gross an extremely impressive $1.148 billion worldwide making it the DCEU's highest-grossing film so far (but maybe Reigns would have pushed it towards the $1.5 billion mark).

Reigns whose cousin is Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson does have some Hollywood experience having played a small role in 2019's Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw.

Meanwhile speaking of Aquaman the second instalment in the DCEU franchise Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom is due for release next December and sees Momoa returning as the half-Atlantean half-human superhero.

KEY TAKEAWAYS: — The world of NFTs has been a hot topic with massive sales and huge artistic appeal for digital and traditional creatives and collectors. While new art might be emerging it doesn’t necessarily come only from new artists.



— Some of the artists in the NFT space have an incredible background in creating with decades of experience working with high-end performers and collaborating with other big-name celebrities.



— As more collectors look to NFTs more artists will be given more opportunities to leverage blockchain to create and sell their art.



— Here we give you the ultimate guide to the biggest NFT artists so you can enter the space with confidence.

NFTs are a the blockchain-powered tour de force that took art by storm in 2021. But who are the key names driving the movement and why? Here we present the biggest NFT artists.

The NFT space offers a totally different way to approach art. With a blockchain-enabled ecosystem NFTs have created a cultural movement appealing to a community that’s building up itself. Unlike other scenes the NFT space decentralized from any industry authorities is driven by a highly engaged dispersed community that plays a massive role in giving momentum to the artists.

It might be difficult to know where to turn if you’re not aware of the pillars but by getting to know the foundation that makes the space (that is the artists) you’re setting yourself up to really get a feel for NFTs – and what drives their community. In this article we’ll go through the proverbial gallery of the most popular artists in the NFT space exploring ten of the top-valued artists in the NFT market (in no particular order).

Pak

We would be remiss to begin anywhere else. The anonymous Pak may be a crypto artist but beyond that he or she is an experimental innovator who is constantly seeking to challenge our perceptions via emerging technology. With an identity shrouded in mystery we don’t know the historical background of the digital artist. What we do know is that they’re behind the studio Undream and AI visual media curator Archillect and it’s for certain: Pak has become one of the most interesting game-changing artists to emerge in the space and to make a success of their art in the NFT realm.

What Makes Pak So Interesting?

Pak’s prominence comes from a particular flavour of art: There’s an element of irreverence in what they create and how they market their work. One collection “The Title” features nine identical pieces each with only two differences: The name and the price. Yep the same artwork sold at different values. It gives you insight into how Pak plays with the idea of value and pinpoints exactly how art is more than just art. It’s a representation of influence culture community and an industry that can market itself if done right. And Pak has consistently managed to get it right with their unusual ways of engaging with different mechanics. It’s a weird and wonderful way of unpacking the way people fall for hype around art – and an artist – and packs it in a neat bundle of discovery into what art is and how a collection can represent a whole lot more than just art.

Pak’s most famous collection was launched in April in collaboration with Sotheby’s. It began when Pak took to Twitter calling on auction houses to offer them a gift.

It was enigmatic and Sotheby’s stepped up to the plate as unknown as it was. It led to a three-day auction of ‘The Fungible‘ the collection that saw a massive $17 million come in.

Pak’s twist on art and value was further highlighted with the Lost Poets collection. Selling what looked like a blank page Pak’s Lost Poets went for 0.32 ETH an amount that doubled over a weekend and has led to a $70 million sale overall. The beauty of the Lost Poets is that the page filled with art only when it was minted. Pak also rewarded those who bought the most pages with additional ones. The move is almost a nod to those who put their trust in the potential work and it’s played out stunningly for the collectors.



The latest to drop The Merge has just closed its public sale and the mechanic is (as is a Pak classic) unusual. Built with increasing scarcity the collection encourages collectors to buy more tokens for the artwork (mass) and each time they buy mass it adds up automatically (or it “merges”). The more mass owned the bigger their NFT will be visually. It’s like a puzzle and the more pieces collectors invest in the bigger their picture is. The massive success of this series (it has gathered close to $100 million in sales) made Pak the most valuable art creator of today.

Beeple

Mike Winkelmann is Beeple and he’s got a wealth of experience in graphics as a designer who works on digital artwork while throwing in elements of motion and movement with film and AR/VR work. He’s got a background of working on concert visuals for some pretty massive performance names like Justin Bieber One Direction Katy Perry Nicki Minaj Eminem Zedd and deadmau5.

Beeple is one of the original trendsetters of the “everyday” movement in graphics – creating and publishing a piece every single day and he’s done this for the past decade.

Beeple’s Work

His most famous NFT work Everydays – The First 5000 Days features a collage of the work that he’s created. Every. Single. Day. Since the beginning. It sold through an auction at Christie’s for a staggering $69 million making him among the three most valuable living artists today.

Recently Beeple’s Human One went for $29 million at a Christie’s auction. While the sale amount is still enough to make the eyes water it’s not the most important element here: the piece itself is setting a new precedent in how interactive and dynamic NFT art can be. Human One shows an astronaut walking around in a glass box with a digitally programmed dystopian setting that changes depending on location time and global or local events. As things unfold Beeple can reprogram the background to a completely different setting. It gives the piece the potential to act as an almost constant line of communication between the art and the audience. It means that the buyer didn’t just buy the NFT. Rather they bought an art piece that connects them to the artist in a way like never before.

XCOPY

Like Pak we don’t actually know who the artist is behind XCOPY’s art. The anonymous London-based artist takes a dystopian style to their digital art exploring the darker themes using distorted visual loops. XCOPY has become an iconic figure in the crypto space with the art featured on SuperRare from the launch on the platform (making them an OG in the cryptocurrency art space).

XCopy’s Two-Part Iconic Style

What gives XCOPY’s work the XCOPY factor lies in the specific style they use with motion. The illustrations themselves have a rough-around-the-edges trademark flavour emphasising the dystopian theme but the animation they use really brings this to life. XCOPY’s art adds the digital dynamic to digital art with the flashing pixels painting a portrait of the path art can take.

Right now XCOPY’s work is valued at $53699755.65 with A Coin for the Ferryman going for a cool $5659695.30.

Fewocious

FEWOCiOUS – Victor Langlois – was not even a fully-fledged adult when he started selling his art with his first piece selling when he was just 17. His art is inspired by a complicated upbringing and a battle with identity. Art became a sanctuary that Victor could find safety behind and his art is emotion at the heart of it. FEWOCiOUS represents the story of success through adversity it’s a hero tale unfolding and the art is one of the key ingredients to the charm.

Before he minted his artworks the highest selling piece he sold went for $90 (and fun fact that collector advised him to sell his work as NFTs). His first minted NFT went for $1500. Just a few days later his work had increased in value by over 10 times his first NFT sale.

Now at only 18 FEWOCiOUS stands as the third top-selling NFT artists.

With the enthusiasm of a young artist and the massive potential of a prodigy we wouldn’t be surprised if FEWOCiOUS is a name taught in art school for years to come.

The Creativity that Crashed Christie’s

Their artwork “The Everlasting Beautiful” went for a whopping $550000 and he gained such popularity that he crashed Christie’s site in June 2021 when buyers flooded to bid on a new series from the artist.

The collection Hello I’m Victor (FEWOCiOUS) and This Is My Life took in an insane $2 million at auction at Christie’s. The five unique NFTs with complementary paintings and never-before-seen doodles and diary entries represent FEWOCiOUS’ artistic and emotional journey showcasing pieces he created from 14 to 18 years.

Fewocious has found incredible success in the NFT world highlighted by a recent collaboration with RTFKT (next-gen sneakers making massive waves in digital fashion).

Refik Anadol

“I use data as a pigment and paint with a painting brush that is assisted by artificial intelligence.”

That’s Refik’s opening line on his Ted Talks where he talks about his art in the day of technology evolution.

Refik was inspired by the architectural futuristic landscape of Blade Runner and his work speaks to this. He works with not only artificial intelligence to produce work but has also teamed up with architects data scientists neuroscientists and musicians to explore what the future of creativity and collaboration can be. He uses data to create art that combines the physical and virtual worlds in an aesthetic rendition of artistic innovation.

The Art of Anadol

Refik’s collection Machine Hallucinations is a collaboration with NASA created for Sotheby’s. The collection blends over two million raw images that were recorded by space institutions across the world into six AI data-created paintings one AR sculpture and an entire NFT room. The NFT room takes art to a brand new level with an immersive technology bringing life to the work and the work to our lives so that we can interact with art space and technology all in one incredible place.

Hackatao

“Born amongst the communities of the web a place where space and time no longer exist “geographically agnostic” where creators can stay anonymous being judged only for their art and where these judges are no longer a handful of experts selected by hierarchies.”

So speaks the bio page of artist duo Hackatao. The game behind the name: ‘Hack’ refers to exploring and discovering layers deeper than surface-level and “Tao” stands for Yin and Yang. And both elements speak to their artistic dynamic.

Hackatao was formed in 2007 and they use a variety of media to create artwork. In 2018 they began storing their work on the blockchain and quickly thrived in the cryptocurrency artspace as a result of how active and involved they are in the blockchain-based art scene.

The Work of Hackatao

Hackatao’s artistic journey started with the creation of their Podmorks little ceramic totem-shaped creatures decorated with drawings. Like the subsequent NFT work of Hackatoa their Podmorks were a collage of interwoven pattern and colour. In 2018 they embraced the world of crypto art and their first NFT Girl Next door. an animated GIF and is a bold entrance that challenges traditional art with strong modern style and a stronger explicit commentary.

The piece changed hands last year for $20503 (38 ETH at the time) two years after minting the NFT. The initial sale brought Hackatao $207 (0.423 ETH at the time). That’s an increase of over 9804%. Their art has gained enormous traction bearing elements of the digital world with new characters music commissions and layers of expertise added in.

Mad Dog Jones

Michah Dowbak launched his artistic career in 2017 using Instagram as a platform for exposure gaining a massive following in just a couple of years. Mad Dog’s graphic style is deeply inspired by cyberpunk and Japanese animation portraying dystopian sci-fi scenes in an Asian metropolitan setting. The cyberpunk style aligns so neatly with the first iteration of the Metaverse portrayed in Neal Stephenson’s Snow Crash. Mad Dog’s art style with the digital dynamic is emphasised in sincerity by his approach to the emerging possibilities that the digital world offers:

“Thinking about the traditional way to enter the art market is a little bit silly. It’s a little dated because the internet is opening up the world… The tools that I have accessible to me are the internet.”

Mad Dog Jones’ Collaborations and Claims to Fame

Hand-drawn or photography rendered and illustrated over his work has exploded and he’s worked with names including Maroon 5 Diesel Run The Jewels Jabbawockeez Chromeo Conor McGregor and Deadmau5.

Earlier this year Mad Dog Jones sold ‘REPLICATOR’ for $4.1 million at Phillips auction house. Not only did it stand as one of the biggest NFT sales at the time but it also was the first NFT piece that Phillips put up cementing Mad Dog as one of the firsts in the scene and marking Phillips as one of the earliest auction houses to take up the innovative art.

Coldie

Ever wanted to see Warren Buffet as a 3D render with a flavour of digital distortion? Look no further than Coldie.

Coldie’s artwork has been featured in national art exhibitions crypto conferences and live auctions. It has a particular style of portraiture that has been distorted

Buffet and a Band

Fun fact! Coldie was one of the first artists to put his work on the blockchain and auction it online making him a NFT pioneer. His work has a floor price of 36 ETH (around $4 275) with his Decentral Eyes collection featuring the famous Warren Buffet pieces. The “undead” collection however has made waves across both crypto art and the goth rock scenes with Coldie collaborating with four-piece outfit Bauhaus.

“This is the future. This is the now.” – Bauhaus

​​The two artistic entities teamed up to create a series of 3D NFTs that features Coldie’s art and Bauhaus’ music in a dramatic collection of artistic expression. It’s an eclectic merge of subcultures art music. And it draws a person in with how delightful experimental it is and just how well that works in the industry.

Trevor Jones

Trevor Jones likes to paint. He also likes to animate. So his work features both. He went to art school in his thirties following a period of depression – saying he saw it as a way of “atoning” – and cultivated a career in creativity for years while working numerous other jobs to stay afloat. Like XCOPY a lot of Jones’ style comes from the dynamic animated component of his work and he thrives when it comes to innovation in art – one of his prior collections featured paintings of QR codes so the boundary-pushing world of NFTs perfectly suited his style. He refers to his foray into the world of NFT art as “a crazy success story.”

Bullish Prices in the Artwork of Trevor Jones

He has the highest average sales on SuperRare (with his pieces going for an average of just over $5300) and his first NFT sold on the platform for over $10000. His most acclaimed to date The Bitcoin Bull animation sold on Nifty Gateway for a stunning $55555.55.

thepressfree.com

His first work in the NFT realm saw him use AR to transform paintings at the Scottish National Portrait Gallery into crypto icons.

“I have no idea what the National Gallery of Scotland will think about this. I haven’t told them what I’ve done…”

It was a digital rebellion without any harm to the original pieces and the move made waves putting Jones on the map.

Since then he’s collaborated with crypto artist Pak. His work with Pak sees the anonymous artist’s cutting minimalism and Jones’ expressive emotional pieces entrenched in traditional influence. The collaboration is a blend of two opposing ends of art and it works spectacularly.

Most recently Jones teamed up with rapper and filmmaker Ice Cube to work on a seven-month long creative project. The collection is a combination of their creative abilities that explore experiment with different subjects styles and concepts. It’s a fusion of media including painting music animation and digital innovation.

FVCKRENDER

Frederic Duquette or FVCKRENDER has earned his place among the biggest NFT artists beginning his art career in his spare time while working a restaurant job. In 2016 he was in a bicycle accident and had injuries and taught himself how to use 3D art software. He set himself the task to create at least one piece a day crafting a unique style that would lead to the popularity he’s got today.

Living in Montreal where illustration art is a big theme one of FVCKRENDER’s biggest aims is to highlight the potential of digital art. His art has evolved and is dynamic but often features crystalline arrangements and surrealist landscapes innovatively using dynamic compositions with a hint of hyper-futuristic flavour.

FVCKRENDER’s collabs and collections at Christie’s

He’s worked with some pretty hard-hitting names like Katy Perry Lil Nas X Lebron James and brands including Puma Spotify Instagram and Supreme. He’s joked that one of his biggest problems is saying no to collaborations a “problem” that’s landed some pretty incredible collaborations on his lap.

One of his biggest NFT collaborations is with Zedd and Gabe Damast. The collection ANTIPODE is a blend of art and music with an audio-first-visual-second and vice versa approach to the artwork.

“ANTIPODE means “the direct opposite to something” and the idea was for both pieces to live in the same universe but to be directly opposing.” – Zedd

FVCKRENDER’s work has also been featured at Christie’s and Sotheby’s as the art auction houses started to dip their toes into the crypto-art space. In May Sotheby’s sold SHIFT// for $107100.

NFTs and Art: The Massive Implication Behind the Quick Explosion

Theresa Kirke died in Lafayette California on August 2 2021 after suffering from advanced stages of Alzheimer’s disease.

Theresa Marie Dwyer was born in Quincy Massachusetts on May 5 1939. She was the youngest of six and carried fond memories of her New England upbringing throughout her life. She earned a scholarship to Emmanuel College in Boston where she earned a degree in mathematics. In 1961 she joined her retired parents in California. She accepted a position at General Dynamics in Pomona where she met Bill Kirke.

They were married in 1963 and made their home in Claremont. They lived there for more than 35 years raising their children Jeanne and John as well as numerous animal companions.

Theresa aka Terry enjoyed sewing cooking and gardening. She volunteered extensively at her children’s schools and for their extracurricular activities. She was the president of the PTA equivalent at Foothill Country Day School. When her children were grown she served as the volunteer coordinator for Pomona Valley Hospital Medical Center’s Cancer Center. She was publicly recognized for her service when she was deemed volunteer of the year by the Cancer Center.

In 2000 the couple moved to Fort Bragg California where they lived in a Victorian near the ocean a setting that reminded her of her youth in New England. They had a good life in retirement for several years. To their neighbors’ delight at Christmastime she would place a lit candle in every window of their notable home.

She became certified to teach tai chi classes and volunteered at the Chinese medicine clinic at The Stanford Inn in Mendocino where she made a wonderful group of friends. Most of all she especially enjoyed visits from her children and grandchildren.

Predeceased in 2019 by her loving husband of 55 years Bill she spent her final years near family in the San Francisco Bay Area. During that time she received the most loving and compassionate care from her caregivers at her memory care home and from Hospice of the East Bay most notably her favorite caregiver Jo Jo and her hospice nurse Vanessa.

She is survived by her beloved sister Patricia O’Donnell and brother-in-law Jim; daughter Jeanne; son John and daughter-in-law Teresa; grandchildren Shannon Isabel Jackson Aly and Tessa; and several nieces and nephews.

The U.S. Navy’s ballistic missile submarines are secretly lurking the depths of the ocean in an unknown location. Their mission is to prevent a nuclear attack on the United States by sending a message to potential adversaries that any nuclear strike would be met with a devastating counterattack.

This will be the mission for the Navy’s next-generation Columbia-class ballistic missile submarines. They are expected to carry out their first patrols in 2030.

The Columbia-class submarines have now been under development for more than a decade. They are intended to replace the existing Ohio-class ballistic missile submarines with a new generation of technology designed to ensure a potential adversary does not contemplate a first-strike nuclear attack on the United States.

The first submarine has been under construction since 2020 and the Navy’s Columbia-class acquisition effort recently won an award for exemplary performance.

The Navy has been working with General Dynamics Electric Boat and its industry partners for many years to conducting research and begin to build the boats’ modules. A technique called “tube-and-hull” forging began many years ago a process which involved welding four missile tubes together to insert them into the structure of the submarine.

The arrival of Columbia submarines could not come soon enough as the existing Ohio-class submarines have already been extended for years beyond their anticipated service life. The undersea leg of the nuclear triad is considered vital to the U.S. strategic deterrence effort; it is nearly impossible to find and track the submarines while at sea.

The Columbias are built with a “life-of-core” nuclear reactor meaning it will not need to come back to dock for a lengthy refueling overhaul during its service life. This greatly extends mission operational time and deployment continuity so 12 Columbia class submarines are expected to perform the mission of 14 Ohio-class ballistic missile submarines.

The submarines will be armed with upgraded Trident II D5 nuclear missiles and incorporate several technologies built into the Navy’s newest Virginia-class attack submarines. Some of these advancements include “fly-by-wire” navigational systems that allow precise speed and depth to be monitored and automated by a computer systems. The boat will also use a fiber-optic cable and communications systems so sailors will be able to view images from a periscope anywhere else in the ship. A sailor will not need to stand directly below the periscope to see its field of view but will be able to see it from somewhere else inside the ship.

After more than half-a-century relying on the 5.56 mm round the Army in 2018 settled on the intermediate caliber 6.8 mm for the Next Generation Squad Weapon program.

The round falls between 5.56 mm and 7.62 mm calibers in the squad- and platoon-level inventory. The government version of the 6.8 mm actually outperforms the larger 7.62 mm in range accuracy and lethality while coming in at a lighter weight than the heavier machine gun caliber.

The Army leads the program and has companies designing weapon prototypes and a new optic.

RELATED Soldiers must get more creative in how they use training ranges with new weapons

The optic will include a “ballistic computer” and the future ability to link with new night vision devices to connect the goggles with the weapon site for target acquisition and engagement. Two companies that provided prototypes were Vortex Optics and L3 Technologies.

Since the original prototype competitions General Dynamics turned over its project to LoneStar Future Weapons which is collaborating with Beretta on parts manufacturing.

Textron Systems is no longer part of the competition. The down-select is now between the Sig Sauer design which closely resembles existing assault rifle ergonomics and the GD/LoneStar/Beretta bullpup configuration.

The bullpup design features a shorter overall length with space saved by putting the magazine well behind the grip in the buttstock. That design is common in some foreign militaries but not so in U.S. units.

The Army is scheduled to select the winner between August and October 2022.

This year began with a level of uncertainty for Navy acquisition as an administration change left naval observers wondering how the new Biden administration would approach the future fleet.

While the Trump administration at the end of 2020 unveiled a delayed shipbuilding plan to increase the size of the fleet it remains unclear what direction the Biden administration – which only submitted a budget request for the current fiscal year as opposed to a five-year outlook – will take.

Still the Navy has resumed a strategy of seeking to divest legacy programs to pursue new technologies and platforms an approach that continued to receive both skepticism and criticism from Congress this year.

With several significant new acquisition programs – including a new fighter aircraft a new attack submarine and a new destroyer – currently in the research and development phases the Navy has multiple big-ticket items to pay for in the next decade as it recalculates a strategy focused on the Indo-Pacific.

Surface Ships

The Navy asked to purchase both large and small surface combatants this year including a request for one Arleigh Burke-class destroyer despite a multi-year procurement contract already in place that planned for the Navy to buy two in Fiscal Year 2022. The decision to ask for one destroyer angered lawmakers who added the second destroyer in their marks of the defense policy and spending bills.

The Navy is also in the research and development stages for several of its future surface ship platforms including DDG(X) which will follow the Arleigh Burke-class. In the meantime the service plans to execute another Arleigh Burke-class destroyer multi-year procurement contract that would span from Fiscal Year 2023 through FY 2027.

The service is also progressing on the Constellation-class frigate program and in May issued Fincantieri Marinette Marine a $554 million contract modification to start building the second frigate in the class. Fincantieri was also slated to begin fabrication of the first frigate – the future USS Constellation (FFG-62) – by the end of the 2021 calendar year. The Navy’s FY 2022 budget request asked to purchase one frigate.

While Congress has pushed the Navy to buy more large amphibious warships the Navy’s acting acquisition chief told lawmakers in June that the Pentagon would likely hold off on executing a preliminary agreement to buy four amphibs until it completes a new force structure assessment.

Meanwhile the Marine Corps remains committed to the need for a Light Amphibious Warship that could shuttle Marines around the Indo-Pacific as they set up expeditionary bases on islands and archipelagos where they could fire anti-ship missiles. In June the Navy awarded five companies – Fincantieri Austal USA VT Halter Marine Bollinger and TAI Engineers – “concept design” contracts for LAW which would come out of the Navy’s shipbuilding budget.

Submarines

The Navy’s submarine acquisition efforts have remained steady with the first Columbia-class ballistic missile boat under construction and the service continuing to pursue the Virginia-class attack boats.

In the Fiscal Year 2022 budget request the Navy asked to buy two Virginia-class submarines and lawmakers signaled they want the service to work up to buying three per year.

The service is also in the early research and development phase for SSN(X) the next nuclear attack submarine class that will follow the Virginia-class boats and asked for nearly $30 million in research and development funding to pursue the new program.

The current head of the undersea warfare division on the chief of naval operations staff (OPNAV N97) recently said the future submarine will focus on blue water operations unlike its predecessor that was designed for operations closer to shore and need to be quiet and have more torpedoes.

“We don’t know the specific characteristics that will be in SSNs. But we do believe that the next submarine will have a large horizontal payload capacity. You can read that as it’s going to carry a lot of torpedoes. And we know how to do that. It’ll be fast. And it’ll have acoustic superiority. That’s both sensors to hear the other ships out there as well as stealth – staying quiet” Rear Adm. Doug Perry said at a conference last month.

“We know how to do all of these things but we have to integrate them into one platform. Speed and large payload? We did that on Seawolf and we need to pull that forward to a modular construction submarine.”

On the organizational side the Navy this year also restructured its program offices for submarines by making the admiral leading the Columbia program the new program executive officer of strategic submarines or PEO SSBN which will cover the Ohio-class guided-missile and nuclear ballistic missile submarines. The service also created a program executive officer for attack submarines or PEO SSN which will manage the Seawolf class the Los Angeles class the Virginia class and the future SSN(X). Part of the restructuring also created a program executive officer for undersea warfare systems to manage undersea weapons and how the Navy’s Project Overmatch initiative – which seeks to create a battle network to connect platforms across domains – will fit into the undersea warfare.

Carrier Aviation

The lead ship in the Navy’s Ford-class aircraft carrier program hit several milestones this year and is scheduled to deploy in 2022 after a series of delays and some reliability issues with key new technologies including the Advanced Weapons Elevators.

USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN-78) wrapped up its post-delivery test and trials phase in the spring before heading into full-ship shock trials over the summer. Officials described the carrier’s shock trial testing – when the Navy detonates 40000 pounds of ordnance in the water near the hull to test the ship and its systems – as having no major flooding injuries or fires aboard.

The carrier is currently in the midst of a planned incremental availability that will span six months before it begins preparing for the 2022 deployment which comes four years after the original planned 2018 deployment date.

Despite the carrier’s progress this year the Navy has still had to take parts from the future USS John F. Kennedy (CVN-79) the second carrier in the class that is currently under construction at Huntington Ingalls Industries’ Newport News Shipbuilding to ensure Ford is ready to deploy this year USNI News previously reported. The Navy has said the cannibalization of parts won’t affect Kennedy‘s schedule.

Aircraft

For nearly two years the Navy has argued it must end the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet production line saying the divestment will allow the service to pursue future technologies and assets like the Next Generation Air Dominance program.

But lawmakers have been skeptical of the Navy’s proposal to end a mature production line and the tension between the service and Congress played out in an open forum over the summer when officials questioned the viability of the Super Hornets against future threats. Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Mike Gilday also criticized defense lobbyists at the time for pushing lawmakers to purchase aircraft the Navy does not want.

“It’s not the 90s anymore. If you go to the tri-service strategy we really try to punctuate the sense of urgency that we feel everyday against China to move to move the needle in a bureaucracy that’s really not designed to move very fast” Gilday said in August. “And so although it’s in industry’s best interest . . . building the ships that you want to build lagging on repairs to ships and submarines lobbying Congress to buy aircraft that we don’t need that are excess to need it’s not helpful. It really isn’t in a budget-constrained environment.”

Despite the service not asking to purchase any Super Hornets in FY 2022 congressional authorizers approved funding for 12 F/A 18 E/F Super Hornets in their final version of the defense policy bill. While the House Appropriations Committee added funding for 12 Super Hornets in its draft of the defense spending bill it’s unclear where the final appropriations bill will fall on the issue.

Meanwhile the Navy continues to pursue its Next Generation Air Dominance program but kept the research and development dollars it asked for in FY 2022 for the program classified. The former air warfare director on the chief of naval operations staff (OPNAV N98) in March said NGAD is expected to be a family of manned and unmanned systems with a fighter known as F/A-XX functioning as the nucleus. That fighter the admiral said at the time is likely to be manned.

The Navy also expects both manned and unmanned platforms to replace its rotary wing fleet. Future Vertical Lift – the term the Navy uses for the platform that will ultimately replace the MH-60R and MH-60S helicopters – is also in the development phase. Requirements include the ability for the platform to operate off the fleet’s frigates and destroyers.

Unmanned Systems

The Navy is continuing its pursuit of unmanned systems across domains including for surface platforms.

This year the Navy took possession of a second medium unmanned surface vessel prototype known as Sea Hawk for experimentation out on the West Coast. Sea Hawk is the sister ship to Sea Hunter which was developed by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).

The Navy’s Surface Development Squadron One out in California has been tasked with experimenting with unmanned surface vehicles to get a better understanding of the concept of operations.

While lawmakers have expressed concerns that the Navy is moving out too quickly on untested technologies it does not yet fully understand the service has signaled its looking for ways to assuage congressional apprehension. For example Capt. Pete Small the Navy’s program manager for unmanned maritime systems earlier this year said the Navy was looking to increase the use of land-based testing of prototypes for unmanned vessels.

Despite the Navy’s push to develop unmanned vessels the service is still working out how it will man the platforms. Small this year also acknowledged that the Large Unmanned Surface Vehicle (LUSV) for now would likely need a small crew detachment to perform tasks like refueling.

Shipbuilding Outlook

While the Navy continued to ask for submarines and surface combatants this year and pursue its research and development efforts for major new programs on the horizon the service lacks a recent publicly available five-year budget outlook and 30-year shipbuilding plan that could fill in some gaps in naval strategy.

The Biden administration’s FY 2022 budget submission for the Pentagon did not include the typical Future Years Defense Plan that provides a five-year budget outlook. Its shipbuilding plan provided to Congress in June only showed FY 2022 construction and potential ranges for programs unlike the detailed 30-year outlook that typically shows the number and types of ships the Navy projects buying in each year.

“The Navy working closely with the OSD Director of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation (CAPE) continues to develop comparative assessments of naval force structure options consistent with Interim National Security Strategic Guidance and designed to maximize the maritime contribution to the joint force” the shipbuilding report read.

“The results of these efforts and ongoing experimentation and prototyping will be reflected in the FY2023 shipbuilding plan.”

While some ship acquisition approaches and planned quantities are firm – like that of the Columbia-class ballistic missile submarine program – the future fleet architecture is likely to become clearer after the Navy submits its FY 2023 budget and a long-range shipbuilding blueprint to Congress next year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyYXRpbmdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL25ldy1zZW5zYXRpb25hbC1jb2xvci1pbWFnZXMtYW1lcmljYW4tYWlybGluZXMtY29udmFpci05OTBzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New sensational color images of American Airlines Convair 990s,"More sensational photos of American Airlines Convair 990 have been colorized by Frenchman Benoit Vienne.

The photos epitomize the raw speed of what was the world’s fastest subsonic jet built by San Diego-based Convair a division of General Dynamics.

Original color imagery of the Convair 990 series is rare and of the American 990 even rarer.

Some years back Airline Ratings discovered and had scanned a small cache of color factory shots of CV880s and CV990s but there was precious little of the American Airlines 990s.

This black and white photo is a classic shot of the American Airlines 990 and Mr. Vienne has done a magnificent job in colorizing it.

Convair pursued American Airlines’ business by guaranteeing an enhanced 880 would beat the competition coast-to-coast by 45 minutes.

American’s chief C.R. Smith was taken by the speed. He wanted a faster jet to “beat the pants” off Texas-based Braniff Airlines which had ordered the domestic 707 with the bigger intercontinental engines for its flights. Braniff marketed it as “The Jet with The Big Engines”.

American’s plan was to use the Convair jet for the first class only “Blue Streak” service and configure American’s 707s for all economy. American purchased 25 of what was essentially a new aircraft from Convair but the aircraft’s radical changes were not made clear to the General Dynamic’s board.

Problems with the aircraft now called the 990 surfaced almost immediately on test flights and the aircraft was unable to meet its speed and fuel burn guarantees despite a host of modifications.

The 990 needed to gulp fuel to reach its speed guarantee.

When the production run finished with just 102 880s and 990s built GD had written off $4.16 million per plane – more than they sold for.

Any possibility of further sales of the Convair jets was dashed when Boeing announced its three-engine 727 tri-jet in 1959.

Suddenly a three-engine jet would basically do the same mission as a four-engine model and be far cheaper per passenger on fuel burn."

While these foods may be once-a-year splurges many of December's most decadent treats are loaded with sugar. Other holiday treats like a flavor-free candy cane fall squarely into the bizarre and unappetizing category.

Here we've rounded up the worst holiday foods ever created whether because they're detrimental to your health or because they're just plain gross.

And for more don't miss these 15 Classic American Desserts That Deserve a Comeback.

Bah Humbug Candy Cane

With no flavor or stripes this plain but oversized candy cane is quite possibly worse than a lump of coal. Because it lacks holiday spirit the Bah Humbug Candy Cane is marketed as a gag gift for the Scrooge on your Christmas list.

Mint Vanilla Milk

Set this green milk out alongside cookies on Christmas Eve and you're practically inviting the gift-stealing Grinch into your home. If you can get past the sight of a green jug of milk in your fridge the TruMoo Mint Vanilla Milk might make for a nice minty milkshake though.

White Chocolate Peppermint Pringles

Pringles which are known to be inventive with potato chip flavors debuted White Chocolate Peppermint Pringles several years back. One staffer at Today described the limited-edition holiday Pringles as tasting like a potato chip with ""a thin layer of toothpaste on it."" Suffice it to say once you popped one of these sweet chips you'd have no problem stopping. Pringles also created limited-time Cinnamon Sugar and Pumpkin Pie Spice chips as if that wasn't bad enough.

Fruit Loaf Cake

Fruitcake is a widely loathed loaf that's made with nuts spices and candied fruits. In fact in one survey of Americans 54% of respondents named fruitcake as the ""most hated holiday"" dessert. Still that didn't stop Target and other retailers from stocking the cake this season.

Mint Chocolate Twinkies

In time for the holidays you can find a new flavor of Twinkies: Chocolate sponge cake filled with mint cream. The Mint Chocolate Twinkies according to the box are ""LiMINTed Edition."" While Twinkies aren't as high in calories as other snacks (two of the cakes clock in at 250 calories) they are loaded with added sugar preservatives and artificial food coloring.

Trolli Sour Brite Reindeer Poop Holiday

If the name of this candy didn't turn you off the neon gummy candies are poo-shaped. The candy comes with quite the storyline too as told on the Candy Warehouse website: ""We've all heard the story of Rudolf the Red-Nosed Reindeer but do you know about his magical twin brother Randy? Trolli Sour Brite Gummy Reindeer Poop is the delicious discharge of Randy the Gummy Pooping Reindeer."" Yikes.

Fireball Cinnamon Holiday Nog

6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

Eggnog by a fireplace? Yes. Eggnog with a fiery flavor? Hmm. This non-alcoholic Fireball Cinnamon Holiday Nog is nudging you to spike it with Fireball whiskey.

Jones Soda Holiday Flavors

Over the years Jones Soda has released holiday packs of its soda with unexpected flavors like turkey and gravy latke fruit cake green bean casserole wild herb stuffing poutine and more. But the beverage company has garnered enough fans for its ridiculous fizzy beverages that it has a petition on its website asking which holiday soda flavors the people demand to make a comeback.

Ketchup Candy Canes

Imagine peeling back the plastic on a red-and-white striped candy cane expecting a delightful peppermint treat and instead the taste of tomato shocks your tastebuds. Ketchup canes are among the many bizarre candy cane flavors made by Archie McPhee.

Hamdy Candy Canes

A holiday ham makes a great main dish at your Christmas dinner. But a ham-flavored candy cane is probably a hard pass even for those who love a sweet-and-savory combination. The Hamby Candy Canes are among the oddball flavors made by Archie McPhee. Other flavors include mac and cheese pizza shiitake mushroom kale and more.

Elf Cereal

If you've seen the holiday classic Elf you know that Will Ferrell's character Buddy the Elf runs on sugar. So it's no surprise that a cereal made in his honor General Mills Elf Cereal is loaded with the sweet stuff. Flavored with maple syrup a cup of these sweetened corn puffs with Christmas tree marshmallows contain a quarter of the amount of added sugar you should eat in a day.

Christmas Pizza

At Pizza Hut in the U.K. you can order a ""Christmas Pizza."" We're not talking about a pizza shaped like a Christmas tree or decorated with red onions and green bell peppers. Instead the pizza has a red wine gravy base and is topped with rotisserie chicken crispy bacon and sage and onion stuffing.

Brach's Turkey Dinner Candy Corn

Already candy corn has plenty of dissenters who despise the sugar and corn syrup candy. But Brach's created a Turkey Dinner Candy Corn mix that's unlikely to win over any more fans. The candy assortment is a mixed bag of candies flavored like roasted turkey green beans stuffing ginger-glazed carrots cranberry sauce and sweet potato pie.

Bojangles' Fried Turkey and Fixings

Bojangles in the past has fried up turkeys making them available as a heat-and-serve option. While the fried turkey itself doesn't add too much extra fat or calories compared to a roasted turkey breast it's the high-calorie extras like mac n' cheese mashed potatoes and gravy and buttermilk biscuits that put this meal deal over the top.

Sugar Cookie Pop-Tarts

Don't let the quippy sayings (""Flake It Til You Make It"") on these holiday-themed Sugar Cookie Pop-Tarts distract you from the nutritional label. If you eat a serving of these toaster pastries for breakfast you'll be starting the day off with more than half of the recommended daily sugar limit.

Chick-fil-A's Peppermint Chip Milkshake

The deliciousness of Chick-fil-A's Peppermint Chip Milkshake isn't up for debate. But a small shake has more than 700 calories more than half the amount of saturated fat you need in a day and more than 100 grams of sugar which is the equivalent of 10 candy canes.

Eggnog Taffy

Eggnog is for sipping not chewing. But trying to convince you otherwise is this Santa Snax saltwater taffy Christmas mix. Other flavors include candy cane chocolate chip cookie dough frozen hot chocolate and pumpkin spice cake.

The foods on this list give fruitcake some competition for the title of ""most polarizing holiday food.""

There were the gruelling nighttime shifts in the 80s the pursuit of investment in the 90s partnerships with some of the biggest manufacturers in the 00s and of course the mainstream media attention of the 2010s.

In the year before he retired though there was one manufacturing site visit that would stand out that would represent the progress 3D printing technology had made and that would confirm to Crump that his efforts over the preceding three decades had been worthwhile.

At a General Motors (GM) facility he joined a group of 25 engineers in walking up and down various segments of a production line and placing post-it notes whenever they found a suitable 3D printing application. Crump expected they’d find around 20 between them. They identified 200.

General Motors’ use of 3D printing can be traced back to the early days. The company has long utilised processes like FDM for prototyping but as with many other automakers has seen the application of the technology grow in recent years.

The company’s big wins have come predominantly in tooling applications with General Motors Additive Manufacturing Senior Engineer Malini Dusey suggesting that GM has established itself as somewhat of a leader in 3D printed automotive tools. Dusey and her colleagues at the Warren Tech Center are responsible for the additive manufacture of such components which are then distributed to GM Assembly Plants in as little as 24 hours.

Expand Steve Fecht for General Motors General Motors Additive Manufacturing Senior Engineer Malini Dusey holds tools made at the GM Additive Industrialization Center using a 3D printer at the GM Tech Center in Warren Michigan. (Photo by Steve Fecht for General Motors) Malini Dusey holds an additively manufactured tool.

“When GM is poised to put new vehicles on the road” Dusey says “we are looking at deploying tooling very efficiently and very rapidly looking at what are the needs how can we improve processes where are the biggest challenges where are the areas that we can actually make a difference? Lead time reduction is of utmost importance and we are seeing that with the use of additive manufacturing we are able to build these tools very quickly adapt to the process they conform to the shape exactly what the job is on hand and also lightweight them.”

More often than not GM exploits its healthy repertoire of FDM systems which was bolstered in late 2019 with 17 additional Stratasys systems including several F900 platforms. This equipment is used to additively manufacture handheld tools as well as larger parts that may need assembling after the print with powder bed fusion technology also being available. FDM has been invested in for its ability to produce load-bearing applications with carbon fibre-reinforced nylon and other ‘highly engineered plastics’ while its SLS systems are more likely to be deployed for thin-walled parts.

As General Motors opened its Additive Industrialisation Center at the Warren Tech Center last year the company outlined its commitment to ‘productionising 3D printing’ and revealed the Cadillac CT4-V and CT5-V Blackwing models to be the first GM production vehicles equipped with 3D printed parts.

For these production parts General Motors will take the same approach as it has with its tooling components. It’s an approach that has so far worked – in last year’s launch of full-size SUVs at the Arlington Assembly plant in Texas GM supplied around 100 hand-apply tools which have been additively manufactured in nylon carbon fibre composite instead of aluminium bringing the weight down in some parts from between 10-40lbs to 3lbs.

“Just because you can use additive for something doesn’t mean that you should” Dusey says. “As we look around again it’s fuelled by the needs and challenges of our manufacturing plants and our folks on the floor and also our supply base because the supply case is stretched just as thin in terms of everything moving so fast. Looking at their challenges and seeing what it is that we can do to help build tools to support their needs is what they’re focused on. That allows us to identify the critical needs where additive would be a good solution.”

General Motors leans on the insights of a range of personnel to identify internal applications of additive. Shop floor staff engineers management and suppliers have all been engaged as General Motors looks to get the most out of the technology. And as Crump fondly remembers it’s not uncommon for the company to also tap into the design expertise of 3D printing tech suppliers in a bid to find solutions.

“It’s company-wide” Dusey finishes. “It comes all the way from the folks on the shop floor who are actually using it – they have the most immediate need – however they will only know what’s possible if they are made aware of the capabilities of additive and even more so if they have experienced some quick successes. A quick success makes a great advocate and allows them to come up with new ideas in the future. This is relevant from the manufacturing floor all the way to management. Each team has different needs and is made up of different folks that are looking to expedite their work in a different way. The needs are varied. However once they are made aware of what the capabilities are it very quickly is translated to the application.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mcmVlcC5jb20vc3RvcnkvbW9uZXkvY2Fycy9nZW5lcmFsLW1vdG9ycy8yMDIxLzEyLzI0L2dtLWFuZC1sZy1zdWVkLW92ZXItZGVmZWN0aXZlLWJhdHRlcmllcy1jaGV2eS1ib2x0cy84OTM5NjIwMDAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GM and LG sued over defective batteries in Chevy Bolts,"Your subscription supports:

Now buyers will need to specifically ensure that they're buying a unit with the feature if they want it. Like so many other issues automakers are having these days it all comes back to the chip shortage.

That's right the front and rear park assist feature in the 2022 Buick Enclave is the latest feature to fall to the chip shortage. According to a report from GM Authority  not every Enclave will be affected though. That's good news considering it was supposed to be standard across every trim.Of course it isn't just General Motors that are facing major hurdles due to the chip shortage. Maserati has pushed back the reveal of the Grecale Ford has halted production of some models at times and the issue doesn't seem to be near its end Due to the same issue General Motors axed features like heated seats ventilated seats and heated steering wheels a while back. It should be noted that they seem to be planning a fix though. They've publicly stated that they'll retrofit vehicles at no cost to the customer when the shortage ends.Of course there's no word yet on whether that same sort of policy will apply to ones without the park-assist feature. There's some speculation that GM will simply offer a discounted rate for the affected Buicks.Regardless nobody is really winning here. General Motors and Buick would love to sell an Enclave with all of its intended features. Despite a big refresh and new styling it's not exactly selling like hotcakes right now. The few customers still interested in the vehicle would surely benefit from this feature.Interestingly enough the Cadillac XT4 which shares the same platform as the Enclave is facing the same limited availability and some models will be sold without park-assist. We'll update this story as more information becomes available.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9uZXdzLmNvbS9yZXRhaWwvdGhyZWUtZGVhbGVyc2hpcC1ncm91cHMtZm9ybWVyLWdlbmVyYWwtbWFuYWdlci1idXktZGVhbGVyc2hpcHMtZGVjZW1iZXLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Three dealership groups former general manager buy dealerships in December,"Swickard Auto Group on Dec. 15 acquired two General Motors dealerships in Alaska bolstering the group's presence in the Last Frontier state.

Nancy Tengler CEO and chief investment officer at Laffer Tengler Investments highlighted payments company Block  the company formerly known as Square. Shares have tumbled 23% this year.

""This is a company that is in the perfect space for disruption but they seem to have faced a number of hurdles this year not just recent regulatory concerns about 'Buy Now Pay Later' but there were worries about slowdowns in payments and as fiscal 'stimmy' checks began to fade"" Tengler said on Thursday.

The tailwinds for 2022 are now piling up she says. An e-commerce partnership with TikTok and its acquisition of 'Buy Now Pay Later' company Afterpay are two reasons to be bullish according to Tengler.

Joule Financial president Quint Tatro instead is focusing on casino stock Las Vegas Sands which is down more than 35% this year.

""Las Vegas Sands has really experienced a double whammy this year. Obviously it's an entertainment name that's going to be in trouble due to Covid but it's also tied to China. So this stock has really been in the trash heap"" Tatro said during the same interview.

Chinese stocks and companies with exposure to the country have had a bumpy 2021 as Beijing cracked down on certain industries ranging from tech to private education amid the nation's uneven economic recovery. Las Vegas Sands generates nearly half of its revenue from Macao a gambling destination off the coast of mainland China.

""I do think travel and gaming will come back"" said Tatro. ""This is a stock that looks fairly cheap has been beaten up but I think will do well in the coming years.""

The footballer said his pomeranian named Lucci was stolen from a house in Los Angeles in 2019 and he offered a reward for its safe return.

Foster Washington a rapper known as Killa Fame shared pictures on social media and helped reunite Sturridge with his pet but said he was not paid.

A Los Angeles court has now ordered Sturridge to pay Washington $30000. Court documents show a default judgment was given meaning Sturridge did not respond to the complaint.

Washington said he felt “let down” by Sturridge. “Hopefully he pays up and doesn’t try to appeal it” he said.

“I’m excited about it I’ve been fighting this case for over a year I can’t believe it’s over. When we found the dog I thought my life was going to be better.”

Washington added he had yet to arrange the payment with Sturridge.

Sturridge 32 said he was “grateful” Lucci was back with his family and claimed he had paid a reward to a “young boy who found my dog”.

Writing on Twitter on Saturday he said: “On Christmas Day to have to relive the events of a robbery is shameful. Other people are trying to benefit for their own personal gain. Thank you to the young boy once again. This was 2 1/2 years ago and a crazy 24hrs. I’m very grateful lucci is back with our family. Love to all.”

In July 2019 Sturridge who now plays for Perth Glory in Australia’s A-League said thieves had broken into a house in west Hollywood California and taken a number of bags in addition to his dog.

He posted a video showing a broken glass door at the property and said: “Somebody’s broke into the house in LA took my dog from the house. Listen whoever knows who broke into my crib I’ll pay you anything. I’m dead serious.

“I wanna know what’s went on. I wanna know why they’ve took my dog. I wanna know why they’ve took bags from upstairs.

“How can you break into a house in LA and take somebody’s dog? Are you crazy? You’ve come into a house to take a dog?

“Yo somebody please find my dog. I’ll pay anything I’m dead serious. I want my dog back man.”

In a separate post he offered “20 30 grand” although it was not clear if he meant dollars or pounds.",,,

It was months before her parents heard her cry. She has never felt the wind ruffle her dark curly hair. She has never felt a raindrop heard birds in the trees or gazed up at the moon. Her siblings have never been able to cuddle her.

PROVIDENCE — For all 17 months of her life Yarielis Paulino-Pepin has only known the warm nest of a hospital room where gentle lullabies tinkle amid the hum swish and beeping of machines keeping her alive.

But now Yarielis is going home.

Aris Pepin became emotional after one of the nurses at Franciscan Children’s Hospital handed her a sheet of paper with notes on it about nutrition for her daughter Yarielis’s discharge. “These are tears of joy” Aris said. After 522 days in the hospital Yarielis Paulino-Pepin was finally going home. Jessica Rinaldi/Globe Staff

It is the day her parents have waited for the day Yarielis would leave Franciscan Children’s Hospital in Brighton. When she hears her parents calling her name Yarielis drums her chubby legs on the mattress of her crib. She wriggles in her onesie and rolls over lifting her head her face turning from her father Danny Paulino to her mother Aris Pepin. She sticks her tongue out and grins.

“Hello Daddy’s here!”

“Who’s here? Mama! Did you miss Mami?”

The couple swoop in and lower the sides of the crib reaching past tubes and monitors to kiss her and tickle her cheeks.

Boston Children’s Hospital saved Yarielis’s life and diagnosed her condition performing open heart surgery and installing tracheostomy and gastrostomy tubes. Then for more than a year the medical staff at Franciscan Children’s gave Yarielis every type of early intervention and therapy available.

Through it all her parents spent every day on the road back and forth between their home in Providence and the hospitals in Boston juggling care of four other children in their blended family. Both worked for the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority but were unable to continue; keeping their family strong through the distance and uncertainty became an all-consuming full-time job. Their older children wondered if they’d ever meet their baby sister as COVID restrictions prevented them from visiting her in the hospital.

Months ago when it seemed impossible her mother made a wish for Yarielis to be home for Christmas. Then the little girl began to gain strength. The nurses at Franciscan saw her happy and loving personality begin to blossom.

On Wednesday a few days before Christmas her mother’s wish came true.

Her pregnancy had gone so well. And then at 36 weeks Aris said her doctor diagnosed her with polyhydramnios an excessive accumulation of amniotic fluid and determined the baby had an abnormal heart.

A few days later on July 20 2020 Aris gave birth to Yarielis. She could barely breathe. Yarielis was immediately intubated and rushed to Boston Children’s.

When Aris and Danny finally saw Yarielis again her tiny 6-pound 2-ounce body was under a tangle of tubes and wires her small face half-hidden by the intubation.

No one knew why Yarielis was sick. Her parents were distraught. Aris sought solace at the hospital chapel praying for her daughter and begging forgiveness for whatever she might have done to cause her baby to be sick. “I said ‘sorry’ to God a thousand times maybe I did something bad in my life” Aris said.

It was no one’s fault. After extensive genetic testing Yarielis was diagnosed with Kabuki Syndrome a rare congenital disorder that affects many different organ systems.

The name comes from the distinct appearance of people with the disorder as if they are wearing makeup used by actors in Japanese kabuki theater which emphasizes wide-set eyes highly arched eyebrows a small jaw and a flattened nose. The disorder delays growth and causes a broad spectrum of intellectual disabilities or delays heart problems low muscle tone difficulty swallowing and immune deficiency.

Dr. Olaf Bodamer director of the Roya Kabuki Program at Boston Children’s Hospital reassured Aris and Danny. This is not typically an inherited disorder: it is caused by a spontaneous change during pregnancy that affects about 1 in 32000 births worldwide.

The genetic condition is nearly nonexistent in people of Caribbean descent such Yarielis’s parents who are Dominican. While there are 500 to 600 people diagnosed with Kabuki Syndrome in the United States Bodamer said there could be more who have not undergone genetic testing.

While there is no cure for Kabuki Syndrome children can show development over time and there is hope for drug therapies on the horizon that could help improve learning and overall development of muscle tone Bodamer said.

Yarielis happened to be in a place where her genetic disorder was recognized and where a team of specialists could help her family care for her.

The National Organization for Rare Disorders or NORD recently designated Boston Children’s Hospital Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women’s Hospital as one of its Rare Disease Centers of Excellence making them part of a small network of cutting-edge facilities that offer specialized care and disease management for people living with rare diseases.

While patients with Kabuki typically do not require 24-hour care Yarielis has a more extreme case Bodamer said.

She was diagnosed with a critical congenital heart defect called tetralogy of Fallot and needed open heart surgery when she was a month old. Constantly on a ventilator she received a tracheotomy at two months old. She has eye abnormalities known as coloboma; they don’t know yet what she can see.

Over time Yarielis has begun to gain strength. The doctors have told her parents that her heart is working well and that the tracheostomy will not be permanent. It is giving her time to get strong enough to breathe on her own.

Her parents call her their “Kabuki warrior.” And they turned to each other to help her fight.

“It was heartbreaking at the beginning” Aris said “but it’s a process.”

“We pray together every night. We both get on our knees right before bed and hold hands” Danny said. “And we talk to God and say ‘Give us strength.’ ”

Aris and Danny sought out other families to learn what was ahead for them and their daughter. They found people on Facebook where they could talk about medications and therapies and how their children were progressing.

Aris also used her TikTok channel @yourrealfantasy to document Yarielis’s journey with photos and videos hoping to inspire other families of children with special needs. She wanted people to see that children like Yarielis can be happy and loved; her followers grew to more than 250000.

But some commenters have been cruel. “I’ve seen many people telling me on social media ‘Why do you expose your daughter? You shouldn’t expose your daughter. How can you enjoy life exposing your daughter when she’s suffering?’ ” Aris said. “She’s not suffering. I just explain to people that I don’t need to hide my daughter just because she’s disabled. I’m very proud of my daughter.”

Later alone with Yarielis during one of their last nights at Franciscan Children’s Danny admitted his fears.

Here all Yarielis has ever known is love and acceptance. But the world as beautiful as it can be is also a hard place he said. Will other people see that she is lovable? Will she be bullied or rejected?

“We bring them into the world you know they don’t ask to be born. So it’s our responsibility to raise these children and care for them no matter what age they are” Danny said. “You know how cruel this world is but it’s your job to protect them and take away all the negativity and always surround them with a positive attitude.”

Staff members at Franciscan Children’s Hospital lined the hallways and held a bubble parade for Yarielis as she was discharged from the hospital and headed home. Jessica Rinaldi/Globe Staff

Before Yarielis could go home the staff at Franciscan Children’s taught Danny and Aris every step of her care — how to use the ventilators the oxygen tanks the monitors; how to care for the tracheotomy and gastrostomy; how to administer her medication and milk around the clock and trouble-shoot alarms.

Finally each parent had to stay at the hospital for 48 hours solo to show that they could handle everything Yarielis could need.

They barely slept but they passed the test. “When you are keeping your baby alive you will do anything” Danny said.

As they packed up the room Danny and Aris took final instructions from their case manager social worker and nurses. They signed discharge papers.

Aris was suddenly overcome. “I’ve been waiting for this day for so long” she says. “This is tears of happiness.”

She dressed Yarielis in a pink-and-white sweater with a matching hat and boots. She cut the toe of the leggings to fit the monitor that tracks Yarielis’s heart and oxygen and covered her in a pink-and-white quilt handmade by her grandmother.

Nurse practitioner Stephanie Hopkins cuddled Yarielis for the last time. “Her parents are as ready as they can be” Hopkins said. “It’s exciting to think of her at home with her siblings and to see her home for the holidays with her family something that people take for granted.”

The baby smacked her lips her way of blowing kisses. “Are you going to miss everybody?” Aris asked her.

As the EMTs wheeled Yarielis out of her room nurses and staff cheered waving bubble wands in the hospital’s traditional “bubble parade” for children who are discharged. Yarielis passed by with her right hand raised like she was the queen of England.

“God bless everyone” Danny said to every person he passed. “Thank you for everything you guys did.”

Yarielis’s uncle Abel Pepin and her brothers Dionyanny Paulino17 and Jossem Peña-Pepin 13 had just finished taping balloons and a welcome banner across their front porch when the ambulance from Boston pulled up to their house in the Mount Pleasant neighborhood of Providence.

Yariel Paulino-Pepin 3 barely waited for the EMTs to open the ambulance doors before he bounded inside. Jasleen Pepin 5 danced waiting to see her sister and shouted: “She’s so cuuuute!”

Mother and child emerged carefully from the ambulance accompanied by EMTs carrying medical equipment. Aris carried Yarielis up the steps and into the house and placed her into the large gray crib that had been ready since before she was born.

Large plastic flowers and letters spelling “Princess Yarielis” decorated the wall over her crib in the living room. The ventilators IV stands oxygen tanks shelves of medical supplies a shopping bag filled with medication and a new refrigerator to store them — everything was ready for the littlest child.

“Welcome home princess” Aris said.

Then as Aris and Danny bustled about with the medical machines under the supervision of a respiratory therapist the two younger siblings clung to the crib railings to get as close as possible to their baby sister.

They touched her nose and her chubby hands showed her toys and tried to make her smile. They squealed when she grabbed their hands and kicked the crib railing. But when Yarielis suddenly turned red opening her mouth in a silent tearful yowl the children screamed for their mother to help her.

Aris calmly dealt with the ventilator alarm and suctioned Yarielis who quieted. The children crept back to the crib railings again. They plinked on a toy xylophone mimicking the sound of her alarms. They took turns with their mother’s stethoscope and listened to each other’s hearts.

All they had known of Yarielis were photos and videos and their parents’ explanations about the baby’s illness. Boston Children’s Hospital had produced a special book for them about Yarielis and her condition. Now here she was and no matter how many times their parents and older siblings pulled them away the two children could not resist her. They were not afraid. They were enthralled.

At last when the wires and tubes were untangled the machines were humming the first round of medication successfully administered when they’d changed her diaper and removed her warm sweater Aris and Danny paused at the crib and took in the sight of their youngest daughter. Yariel joined them.

Propped up against a curved pillow Yarielis gazed up at them. She was in her own home with her family for the first time in her life.

They don’t know what’s ahead for Yarielis but right now for the first time in 17 months they are all together.

“You know that you are home baby” Aris cooed to her baby daughter who smiled back. “You know that you are home.”

Aris talked to Yarielis as Yariel squeezed in to get a better look at his baby sister. Danny spoke to the respiratory therapist who had come to oversee the setup. Jessica Rinaldi/Globe Staff

Under terms of a plea deal Inyoung You 23 received a 2 1/2 year suspended jail sentence and 10 years of probation and was barred by a judge in Suffolk Superior Court from profiting from her case in any way. The sentence means You can avoid time behind bars if she adheres to all the terms of her probation which includes continued mental health treatment and community service.

Prosecutors said You sent Alexander Urtula 22 of Cedar Grove New Jersey tens of thousands of messages in the last two months of their relationship including many urging him to “go kill yourself.” Urtula died in Boston in May 2019 the day of his Boston College graduation.

The investigation described You and Urtula's 18-month-long relationship as “tumultuous dysfunctional and unhealthy” and found You ""engaged in deeply disturbing and at times relentless verbally physically and psychologically abusive behavior toward Mr. Urtula"" according to a statement from the office of Suffolk District Attorney Rachael Rollins released after Thursday's hearing.

Those actions intensified in the days and hours before Urtula's death the office said.

You who was born in South Korea and is a naturalized U.S. citizen sent Urtula more than 47000 text messages from late March 2019 until his death in which she “repeatedly told the victim that he should kill himself or die and waged a campaign of abuse that stripped the victim of his free will"" the office said.

“Words matter"" Rollins said in the statement. “Demeaning language ridicule and verbal abuse can deeply impact people.""

The plea deal was reached in consultation with the Urtula family Rollins said.

The family in a statement read in court described driving to Boston for a day of celebration and instead finding themselves planning a funeral.

“We bear no feelings of anger or reprisal. We believe that time will take us through in the moments we mourn and celebrate his life” the family said.

Before her arraignment in November 2019 when she originally pleaded not guilty You through a public relations firm released some of the text messages suggesting she tried to stop Urtula and alerted Urtula’s brother in the moments before his death.

You was given the opportunity to speak in court but declined. Her lawyer said she was “very distraught.”

Attorney Steven Kim said You is a “wonderful young woman who has deep deep remorse.”

The case was compared to that of Michelle Carter who garnered national headlines and an HBO film. The young Massachusetts woman was sentenced to 15 months in jail after she was convicted in 2017 of involuntary manslaughter for using text messages and phone calls to encourage her boyfriend Conrad Roy to kill himself in 2014. Her attorney argued that her messages were protected free speech.

He’s an Oscar-winning actor director screenwriter and producer. She’s a lawyer and activist. Together they’re the world’s most stylish parents to their twins Ella and Alexander who were born in June 2017. Suffice it to say this power couple is often on the move and in need of a comfortable inviting spot to call home—no matter where they find themselves. Whether it’s a luxurious villa in Lake Como or a hip condo in Manhattan all of the Clooneys’ homes are truly fit for Hollywood royalty. Here we’ve rounded up six of the couple’s most well-known properties a collection that’s truly evolved with them through their different life stages.

1995

George Clooney first rose to fame in the early ’90s playing Dr. Doug Ross on the hit medical series ER. By the mid-’90s his growing popularity meant he needed to up the security of his home he explained on CBS’s Person to Person in 2012. “I was in the second season of ER living in a little house and I thought Well maybe it’s time to get a little bit larger house off the street so I wouldn’t fall prey to every photographer” he said. He bought a $2.2 million villa in Studio City from none other than rock legend Stevie Nicks. At the time the main house spanned 7354 square feet and featured six bedrooms; the actor has sunk millions into the expansion of the property in the years since so it’s possible the configuration has changed.

Scenes from inside George’s longtime home via Person to Person reveal hardwood floors coffered ceilings stone fireplaces and a massive dining room featuring an entire wall showcasing his extensive wine collection. Amal revealed in a 2018 Vogue interview that the home has become more of a “low-key house” than an “entertaining space” since the couple welcomed their twins in 2017. Amenities include a home theater with a popcorn machine a bar featuring vintage Hollywood photos and an outdoor pool and bar. “A home is a place where your family and friends are a part of” Clooney said in the 2012 CBS interview. “That’s one of the wonderful things about where I’ve been for so long. I’ve been here for almost 20 years and it’s filled with good friends and family members.”

Perhaps not for you. But for the half of the globe who celebrate Christmas during their summer and for the good portion of the Northern Hemisphere that rarely gets cold the idea of a white Christmas is about as fanciful as the chance of a workshop of elves suddenly fixing this holiday season's supply chain problem.

Despite the avalanche of snow-centric Christmas stuff every year there's plenty of us who don't spend our Christmastime freezing — and who like it just that way.

I don't begrudge anyone their wintery celebrations of course. I spent a good chunk of my adult life in New York City and can certainly appreciate the charms of a snow-flecked Christmas season. But as a native Floridian who now lives in Los Angeles I've long bristled at the depictions of white Christmas as normative in popular culture. And I want to call attention to the holiday's warmer celebrations that deserve more recognition especially as our planet keeps getting hotter.

Considering that a majority of the world celebrates a non-cold Christmas and that the holiday's origin story occurred in a temperate location — and probably actually took place during June — it's worth thinking about how Christmas came to be so associated with snow in the first place. Much of it is due to the influence of Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol the iconic story that in many ways helped create the way we celebrate Christmas today. The 1843 story's snowy setting though is the result of what one historian has called ""a mere accident of history"" since Dickens wrote the tale during an extraordinarily cold period in Britain marked by otherwise rare heavy snowfalls.

In the U.S. the popular Currier and Ives prints of snowy winter landscapes also helped create the template for American Christmas imagery. But nothing froze the white Christmas standard in the American mind more than the popular Bing Crosby song of the same name all the more so when it became the basis of the 1954 box office hit. White Christmas takes place in a Vermont resort town where two traveling performers have journeyed to seek snow after spending their two previous holidays in South Carolina and Hawaii. ""They didn't seem like Christmases"" one of them explains. ""There ought to be snow.""

Maybe not. Millions of holiday revelers around the world know there's a lot to be said for enjoying the day outdoors basking in good weather. In places like Australia Hawaii and Florida thousands spend the day sunbathing on the beach — which seems to me a far better option than having to painfully thaw oneself out after a brief trek through a snowy landscape.

Each year Surfing Santas crowd the shorelines in Cocoa Beach Florida and Santa Cruz California a far more pleasant tradition than the masochistic polar bear plunges to which others subject themselves in frigid locales. In the central Florida town where I grew up one of the neighborhood moms took her family out water skiing every year on Christmas Day. Her reason? ""Because we can."" Comfort and joy indeed!

Not being cold also means Christmas dinner doesn't have to be a retread of many of the same dishes you just ate a few weeks ago at Thanksgiving. Many Southern homes for example serve ambrosia on Christmas Day because the chilled fruit salad is especially pleasing when the weather is warm. Down under Australians often host outdoor seafood banquets. And South Africans like to spend the day outside braaing — their version of barbequing. In my book that easily beats another tired holiday meal of turkey dressing and mashed potatoes.

Plus there's just something about a lush green environment that speaks Christmas to me in a way no whited-out or more likely in real life gray and rainy setting ever could. Green is one of the holiday's colors after all. Put on some red shorts or a polo for the family picture and you've really captured the perfect look for the day. Even better if there's a palm tree trimmed with Christmas lights in the background.

No doubt for those who are used to bundling up and hoping for snowfall on Christmas a warm-weather Yuletide can be a jarring adjustment especially for the many Americans who have recently relocated from the Northeast to places like Florida and Texas in our COVID moment.

The first couple of times my now-husband an Ohio native came home with me to Florida for the holidays he continually voiced a complaint many of those transplants may be thinking this year: ""This just doesn't feel like Christmas"" he said as we put on shorts to watch the niece and nephew play outside with their new toys in the warm afternoon sunshine. ""It feels just like Christmas to me"" I always retorted unwilling to concede that my lifetime experiences of the holiday were anything unusual or counterfeit.

It didn't take long for him to embrace all the pleasures of a warm Christmas not least the schadenfreude of posting pictures of oneself barefoot beside a pool. And with climate change swiftly altering global weather patterns more Americans may need to embrace different traditions and images of the holiday to avoid a bah humbug! attitude about the day. As experts at Weather.com wrote two years ago thanks to a warming planet ""most of the world will never see a white Christmas.""

That's no need to despair — although that certainly doesn't lessen the urgency of combating climate change. Yet when it comes to milder weather Christmases there is so much to enjoy. Whatever the climate of your Christmas this year here's wishing all of you that it will be your warmest holiday yet."
GS,Goldman Sachs,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vcHJvc3BlY3Qub3JnL2p1c3RpY2UvZ29sZG1hbi1zYWNocy1maW5kcy1uby1wcm9ibGVtLXdpdGgtZm9yY2VkLWFyYml0cmF0aW9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Goldman Sachs Finds No Problem With Forced Arbitration,"× Expand Richard Drew/AP Photo Among the nation’s big banks Goldman Sachs in recent years has drawn unwanted attention to its insistence that employees arbitrate.

At first glance it looked like great news for the movement to quash mandatory arbitration of employment claims.

In early June Goldman Sachs & Co. said it would undertake a review of its practice of barring employees from suing the firm in court. It was a surprise turnaround by the company which had fought and narrowly defeated a shareholder proposal seeking the arbitration probe.

But 49 percent of shareholders voting in favor of having Goldman investigate the controversial policy was enough to shame the company into switching gears.

Hopes immediately ran high. “This is for all women who’ve been harassed and then SILENCED” tweeted arbitration foe and former Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson on the news of Goldman’s June decision. “No more! America is awake and we have a voice.”

America may be awake but it doesn’t look like Goldman is. With its inquiry complete the firm said in a report released on Tuesday that concerns about mandatory arbitration are simply “not applicable” to the giant investment bank. Arbitration “remains the better way to resolve disputes between employees and the firm” the report asserts.

That might come as a surprise to the thousand-plus women who last year were thrown out of a decade-long ongoing class action gender discrimination case Chen-Oster v. Goldman Sachs after Goldman convinced a federal judge they had no right to be in court. Another 700 women in the case were allowed to opt out of arbitration.

The firm said in a report released on Tuesday that concerns about mandatory arbitration are simply “not applicable” to the giant investment bank.

Given the authors of the report its dismissal of concerns about arbitration might be expected. The law firm hired to conduct the review previously represented Jeffrey Epstein and Roman Polanski in their high-profile sexual assault cases and the university professor the law firm hired to assist on the review is affiliated with two arbitration forums.

According to the report Goldman hired the powerful global law firm Steptoe & Johnson to do the review and Steptoe in turn retained a well-known international labor scholar and law professor at New York University Samuel Estreicher to assist. Estreicher’s bio says he is “a member of the arbitration/mediation panels” of the American Arbitration Association and Center for Public Resources. He did not respond to an email query.

Steptoe’s many services include independent and internal investigations that have been used by clients including the oil field services company Tidewater Inc. the travel center and diesel fuel company Pilot Flying J and AmSouth Funds according to Steptoe’s website.

A client who was not mentioned on the firm’s site was the University of Michigan which hired Steptoe last year to take charge of a sexual abuse investigation but then replaced the firm after it learned that attorneys in a different branch of Steptoe “once represented prominent clients who were accused of sexual misconduct” according to a university press release. Steptoe it turns out had represented the late financier Jeffrey Epstein and director Roman Polanski. In its press release the university said that Steptoe’s affiliations with the men had the potential to discourage abuse survivors from coming forward.

A spokesman for Steptoe declined comment. I asked a Goldman spokesman in a set of written questions why it chose Steptoe given its affiliations with Polanski and Epstein but he declined to respond referring me back to the report the company posted this week.

In arbitration the employer picks the forum; the hearings are behind closed doors; the arbitrators often are retired white male former judges; and the legal filings aren’t public. One of the lawyers representing the women in the Chen-Oster suit Adam Klein said in an email to the Prospect that arbitration is a powerful impediment to change: “There’s no public accountability and no means to remedy systemic discrimination within the arbitration process.”

“The idea that they are still trying to use this system to cover up their dirty laundry is incredibly misguided. Quite honestly the Dark Ages” Carlson said in an interview.

Goldman won’t be dropping its arbitration policy but that’s not to say that nothing will change. Its board of directors which received a copy of the report in October told management it wanted regular updates on sexual harassment matters; periodic assessments of the arbitration program; and a waiver of confidentiality on sexual harassment arbitration outcomes if an employee so desires. Laura Campos director of corporate and political accountability at the Nathan Cummings Foundation which initiated the proposal said in a tweet this week that Goldman reached the wrong conclusion “but at least they’ve decided to make confidentiality provisions optional for sexual harassment claims.”

“There’s no public accountability and no means to remedy systemic discrimination within the arbitration process.”

In fairness Goldman is hardly alone in shutting off access to the courts. Its peers in the financial world were pioneers among American industries fighting and winning key Supreme Court battles in the late 1980s and early 1990s that made it legal to execute contracts that would take away court rights from workers.

Among the nation’s big banks though Goldman in recent years has drawn unwanted attention to its insistence that employees arbitrate engaging in a battle royal with women who sued 11 years ago. Those remaining in the class action are hoping to finally go to trial in 2022.

The new Goldman report did stand out for its decision to allow some employees to waive the firm’s confidentiality requirement but the concession might be less than meets the eye. The carefully worded report said that the confidentiality of arbitration “decisions” in harassment cases could be waived—an ambiguous reference to something that could be as narrow as allowing a woman to say only whether she had won or lost or as broad as permitting her to speak about details of the hearings and of the harassment she’d endured.

Among my unanswered written questions to Goldman were inquiries as to what exactly it would allow a sexual harassment litigant to reveal. It’s “completely unclear” what Goldman means when it talks about waiving confidentiality said Meredith Benton founder of the ESG consulting group Whistle Stop Capital which assisted the shareholder activists at the Nathan Cummings Foundation with the shareholder proposal. Benton emphasized that she was not speaking on behalf of the Foundation.

Goldman has a long history of battling the women who challenge it. Rita Reid a vice president in the firm’s investment banking division from 1987 to 1992 tried to sue Goldman for gender discrimination in court but was sent to arbitration before a panel of three New York Stock Exchange arbitrators. In an unusual 19-page decision—arbitrators rarely explain their reasoning—the panel conceded that by 1990 there had been only one woman partner in the history of the firm; that the future U.S. Treasury secretary senior partner Hank Paulson had said he would not add a woman to a team if a new client didn’t want women; and that Goldman destroyed some documents used for partnership evaluations while other documents that contained no evidence of discrimination were retained. Nonetheless the arbitration panel unanimously dismissed Reid’s claim that the firm discriminated against her when it failed to make her a partner.

Over the years some plaintiff’s lawyers have been able to get details of harassment and discrimination into public view by filing in court knowing full well that they’ll be detoured to arbitration. Goldman has that covered too. In an exhibit filed in the Chen-Oster discrimination case against Goldman a redacted copy of an employment contract signed by former chief executive Lloyd Blankfein admonishes a female managing director not only that she must use one of three approved arbitration operations for any dispute but that she must not file a claim anywhere else.

There is “no indication that the firm’s arbitration program shields employees who engaged in misconduct—sexual harassment or otherwise” the firm reported this week. But considering Goldman’s efforts to keep things under wraps how would we ever know?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN1dS5lZHUvZXZlcnl3aGVyZS9zdG9yaWVzL2plbm5pZmVyLWhhbnNlbi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jennifer Hansen ('09)) - SUU to Olympic Camera | SUU,"Jennifer Hansen (’09)

SUU to Olympic Camera

Originally published on December 24 2021.

SUU certainly has its share of students who graduate to great and covetable occupations and Jennifer Hansen stands proudly among them as a much in-demand freelance broadcast camera operator capturing some of the world’s most exciting sporting events from Utah to Japan.

The 2000 graduate of Salt Lake City’s Cottonwood High School learned her craft in SUU’s communication department where she was given many hands-on experiences that she says “helped catapult my education and career-to-be.”

Today she is contracted through various companies (ESPN TNT FOX CBS and others) to work jobs in the sports industry—from motor racing to bull riding to the NBA—as well as in other areas. She has plied her trade at three Olympics (volunteering at the SLC Olympics) the height of her profession she says.

At SUU she says she learned that she could do anything.

“I learned that just because someone hasn’t done it doesn’t mean it’s impossible” she says. “I learned that if you ask the answer is usually yes. But if you don’t ask it is always no. And I learned that I am a lot stronger than I thought I was.”

She credits faculty members Jon Smith and Todd Petersen as among the leaders of a large cadre of teachers and influencers who helped her grow at SUU.

“My time at SUU was basically a rehearsal for my career” she says. “I had more hands-on direction and education than I would have had anywhere else. And it was practical. Everything I learned was directly transferable in my career.”

Jen sees her job as a grand challenge.

“A lot of people can use a camera. Some operators can get great shots. Even fewer can get the perfect shot at the moment it happens. That’s the excitement for me” she says. “Everyone is watching and you have one chance to make it. Thrilling and scary. Stressful but rewarding.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhbG9uLmNvbS8yMDIxLzEyLzI1L2NvcnBvcmF0ZS1hbWVyaWNhcy10b3AtMTAtYmx1bmRlcnMtb2YtMjAyMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Corporate America's top 10 blunders of 2021,"Much was made of the ""death"" of political comedy during the Trump years. Satire and parody many argued need foils of real-world respectability. And Donald Trump the GOP's new lodestar has pretty much dispensed with the conventions of political decorum. But while postured propriety may have lost its luster in the political realm it remains alive and well in the private sector making Corporate America's blunders all the more visible.

2021 saw endless gaffes and gaucheries from powerful American corporations. Some were caught red-handed in embarrassing and nefarious schemes never meant for the public eye. Others waged embarrassing public relations offensives that earned unintended blowback. To critical onlookers all of the failed contrivances stand together as one big comedy of terrors.

Here are the private sector's top ten fuck-ups of 2021:

10. Ozy Media's co-founder impersonates YouTube executive in meeting with Goldman Sachs

In February executives from Ozy a digital media company whose financial practices have been widely scrutinized were closing in on a $40 billion cash injection from Goldman Sachs when they held a videoconference to hammer out the details of the deal. As The New York Times' Ben Smith would later go on to describe the Feb. 2 meeting was a bizarre mix of technical difficulties and deception.

During the meeting Alex Piper the head of unscripted programming for YouTube Originals was supposedly having technical difficulties on Zoom so all parties switched over to teleconference. Once the switch was made Goldman's executives heard from a man apparently impersonating Piper who gave a rapturous review of Ozy's management. After circling back with YouTube Goldman quickly realized that the man they'd heard from was Samir Rao the co-founder and chief operating officer of Ozy itself.

After Ozy's CEO admitted to the incident multiple board members reportedly pushed Rao to take a leave of absence. Ozy also lost its seed funding and saw resignations from former chairman Marc Lasry and co-founder Carlos Watson.

9. Basecamp bans employees' political discussions

Tech bros are notorious for their professed love of ""free speech"" – but the managers at Basecamp didn't even bother to pretend.

In April the web software company's leadership formally prohibited any and all ""societal and political discussions"" in internal company chat rooms calling such communications ""a major distraction"" from productivity in the workplace. CEO Jason Fried and co-founder David Heinemeier Hansson reportedly announced the policy in a blog post according to The Verge and later held an hours-long all-hands meeting that left several employees ""in tears"" over the company's decision.

The conflict reportedly arose in part from a ""long-standing company practice of maintaining a list of 'funny' customer names"" some of which include those of Asian and African descent. Additionally the company's longtime head of strategy reportedly questioned the existence of white supremacy.

Hours after the company's ban was announced at least 20 employees – over a third of Basecamp's entire workforce – resigned in protest.

8. Citizen places $30000 bounty on wrongfully accused arson suspect

In May as Los Angeles was struggling to contain a 1200-acre fire in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood Citizen the ""public safety"" app that gives users real-time crime alerts thought it might help out. Early into the containment effort investigators had ruled the fire an arson. So Citizen put out a $30000 bounty to help locate the suspect offering cash payments to any user with information about who might've started the fire.

According to VICE Citizen CEO Andrew Frame led a ""citywide app-fueled manhunt"" directing his employees to continue upping the ante on the bounty as users struggled to identify the arsonist. ""FIND THIS F*CK"" Frame told his employees over Slack. ""LETS GET THIS GUY BEFORE MIDNIGHT HES GOING DOWN.""

After Citizen identified Devin Hilton a homeless man as the suspected arsonist circulating Hilton's photo to roughly 861000 users law enforcement authorities shortly arrested Hilton and later found they had scant evidence to charge him with anything.

The sheriff who questioned Hilton said Citizen's manhunt was ""potentially disastrous.""

After Hilton was eventually released Citizen apologized: ""Once we realized this error we immediately retracted the photo and reward offer. We are actively working to improve our internal processes to ensure this does not occur again. This was a mistake we are taking very seriously.""

7. Better.com CEO fires 900 employees over Zoom before Christmas

Earlier this year things at online mortgage originator Better.com seemed to be going well – at least on paper. The company had significantly raised its profile after announcing back in May that it would go public via an SPAC merger. And last month Better revealed that it would be receiving a $750 million cash injection from investment management company SoftBank.

But on December 8 CEO Vishal Garg did something that according to reports few employees expected. Citing issues with ""the market"" and ""productivity"" Garg laid off 9% of his entire workforce just before the holidays in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic over Zoom.

Facing a maelstrom of criticism from employees who were given a month's pay and three months of benefits the executive only felt inclined to apologize for the way he handled things.

""I failed to show the appropriate amount of respect and appreciation for the individuals who were affected and for their contributions to Better"" Garg said.

""I blundered the execution.""

6. AT&T bankrolls far-right One America News Network (OANN)

AT&T the world's largest telecommunications company has apparently been central to the success of one of the most corrosive news channels in America.

In October a Reuters investigation found that AT&T has been the financial life force of One America News Network (OANN) a far-right news channel known for peddling baseless – and downright dangerous – conspiracies theories about the pandemic and the 2020 election.

According to OANN founder Robert Herring Sr. the far-right network was originally inspired by AT&T executives who wanted to monetize a conservative news network. AT&T has also reportedly disbursed roughly $57 million in monthly fees to OANN since 2013 and at one point sought to buy the channel for $250 million.

Shortly after the report AT&T said it's ""never had a financial interest in OAN's success and does not 'fund' OAN."" (And we should probably trust AT&T on this point since the company is squeaky clean otherwise.)

5. Howard Schultz uses Holocaust analogy to describe Starbucks' mission

In November as Starbucks employees in Buffalo New York were organizing to hold a historic union vote management threw out a series of Hail Marys in a bid to squash the effort. One of these counter-offensives came in the form of an appearance from billionaire Howard Schultz Starbucks' former chairman who sallied over to Buffalo to vaguely dissuade pro-union workers from unionizing.

In front of hundreds of baristas Shultz expressed that Starbucks is ""not a perfect company"" saying: ""We listen. We learn. We get better together."" Schultz a Jew then thought it wise to invoke a Holocaust metaphor by recounting a story once told to him by a rabbi.

Referencing blankets shared by prisoners at Nazi concentration camps Schultz said ""So much of that story is threaded into what we've tried to do at Starbucks – is share our blanket.""

4. Amazon executive claims company is ""the Bernie Sanders of employers""

Starbucks isn't the only company that sufficiently embarrassed itself during a union effort. Back in March Amazon was also in the midst of waging a comprehensive – and ultimately successful – campaign to defang a union effort led by warehouse workers in Bessemer Alabama.

At the time Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont long a crusader of labor rights announced that he'd be speaking in Birmingham to offer support for the union drive. But Dave Clark the CEO of the company's worldwide consumer vertical found Sanders' impending presence a tweetable offense.

""I welcome @SenSanders to Birmingham and appreciate his push for a progressive workplace. I often say we are the Bernie Sanders of employers"" Clark tweeted but that's not quite right because we actually deliver a progressive workplace.""

The very next day stories of Amazon workers having to pee in bottles to meet efficiency demands began making the rounds online. Amazon immediately denied any reports of this happening and later apologized for denying them.

3. ExxonMobil lobbyist caught in Greenpeace ""sting"" operation

It isn't often that you get to see a corporate lobbyist caught with their pants down. But this year thanks to Greenpeace we saw just that.

Back in July Unearthed an environmental news team run by Greenpeace UK led an undercover ""sting"" operation against two Exxon lobbyists to gain better insight into the dark art of oil lobbying. Posing as corporate headhunters Unearthed ensnared Keith McCoy (a senior director for federal relations at Exxon) and Dan Easley (a former Exxon White House lobbyist) asking them questions about their experiences laundering the company's interests through the federal government.

McCoy and Easley soberly remarked on the many ways in which Exxon has effectively shut down meaningful climate action even describing oil industry trade groups like the American Petroleum Institute as the company's ""whipping boys.""

""Did we join some of these 'shadow groups' to work against some of the early efforts [at regulation]? Yes that's true"" McCoy said during his interview. ""But there's nothing illegal about that. You know we were looking out for our shareholders.""

After the report Exxon CEO Darren Woods claimed that McCoy and Easley's remarks were ""entirely inconsistent with the way we expect our people to conduct themselves."" (And he's not entirely wrong; if you're trying to hide the fact that your business depends on the earth's destruction you'd want your lobbyists to be a bit more discreet about it.)

2. Reddit comes to GameStop's rescue

Back in January of this year GameStop – a video game retailer that had been struggling financially years before the pandemic – was facing certain death. Major institutional investors on Wall Street like Melvin Capital had put down massive short positions on the stock and so the company's downfall seemed like a self-fulfilling prophecy. That is until a brigade of Reddit investors entered the picture.

Seeing that Wall Street was shorting the company Reddit users from an amateur retail investing forum known as ""r/wallstreetbets"" led an offensive against the institutional bigwigs collectively pouring millions of dollars into GameStop. The effort caused GameStop's stock to skyrocket by over 2000% trapping Melvin in a shortsqueeze. (This means that Melvin was forced to buy GameStop's stock to cover its losses – a move that caused the stock to rise even more.)

Things got so chaotic that billionaire investor Leon Cooperman went on CNBC to deliver an unhinged screed about Reddit's ""attack"" on wealthy people saying that ""fair share is a bullshit concept. It's just a way of attacking wealthy people. It's inappropriate and we all gotta work together and pull together.""

In the end Melvin lost around 53% of its assets ($4.5 billion) as a result of the affair and had to be bailed out by another asset manager.

1. Facebook changes its name amid a devastating whistleblower scandal

This year Yahoo Finance selected Facebook as the ""Worst Company of the Year"" – and for good reason.

In September with help of The Wall Street Journal ex-Facebook employee Frances Haugen began leaking a trove of damning internal documents which reveal that Facebook is both aware of its harmful impacts on Americans and has done next to nothing to mitigate them.

Thousands of documents leaked by Haugen show that the company systematically prioritizes profit over combating hate and misinformation a lapse that directly fomented the Capitol riot according to The Washington Post and has led to genocidal violence abroad. In an interview with ""60 Minutes"" Haugen claimed that Facebook established a program known as Civic Integrity designed to combat misinformation. However this program was dissolved ahead of the 2020 election which she said was a ""betrayal of democracy.""

By the end of October Facebook facing perhaps more public scrutiny than any company in modern history changed its name to ""Meta"" to reflect its sudden interest in developing the Metaverse a hypothetical 3-D version of the Internet. Coincidence? I think not.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pbmluZy5jb20vdG9wLWNvcHBlci1zdG9yaWVzLW9mLTIwMjEtYW5kLXdoYXQtdG8tZXhwZWN0LWluLTIwMjIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Copper supply in 2022 – eyes on Chile Peru DRC - MINING.COM,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.mining.com/top-copper-stories-of-2021-and-what-to-expect-in-2022/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pbmluZy5jb20vdG9wLWNvcHBlci1zdG9yaWVzLW9mLTIwMjEtYW5kLXdoYXQtdG8tZXhwZWN0LWluLTIwMjIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZW5ld3MuY29tLnBrL3ByaW50LzkxOTU4My1pbmRpYW4tcnVwZWUtbm93LWFzaWEtcy13b3JzdC1jdXJyZW5jedIBTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZW5ld3MuY29tLnBrL2FtcC85MTk1ODMtaW5kaWFuLXJ1cGVlLW5vdy1hc2lhLXMtd29yc3QtY3VycmVuY3k?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Indian Rupee now Asia’s worst currency’,"A representative image.

ISLAMABAD: The Indian rupee has been described as Asia’s worst-performing emerging market currency by the New York-based financial and media company Bloomberg with its recent report also suggesting that foreign funds are fleeing the country’s stocks.

The recent damning report that spurted social media trolling of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi across India says currency declined 1.9 per cent this quarter as global funds pulled $4.2 billion of capital out of the country’s stock market the most among regional markets where data is available.”Foreigners sold Indian stocks as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Nomura Holdings Inc. recently lowered their outlook for equities citing lofty valuations at a time when concerns about the omicron virus variant are roiling the global markets.

Record-high trade deficit and the central bank’s policy divergence with the Federal Reserve have also impinged on the rupee’s carry appeal “ said the report.Quoting expectations from QuantArt Market Solutions of rupee declining to 78 per dollar by end-March falling past the previous record low of 76.9088 reached in April 2020 it mentions a Bloomberg survey of traders and analysts forecasting the rupee at 76.50.



The rupee is set to drop about 4 per cent this year in a fourth straight year of losses the report said. “Bearish rupee calls are rising as India’s trade deficit widened to an all-time high of about $23 billion in November amid higher imports. The ample liquidity in the banking system partly created by the RBI’s dollar purchases may make it difficult for the central bank to intervene to the same extent in 2022 to curb rupee’s losses according to Goldman Sachs said the report."

HARTFORD Conn. — Every year on Christmas Eve The House of Bread welcomes its guests in for a holiday meal. It gives them a warm place to gather and people to enjoy their time with.

“It’s the bread and butter of Hartford The House of Bread"" House of Bread guest Shawn Coleman told FOX61.

Head Chef Andrea Johnson is expecting more than 170 people to show up for a special lunch on Friday. She will be serving prime rib collard greens and more.

""Yeah I put my heart and soul in it so that’s fun for me"" Chef Johnson who also serves as an instructor for The House of Bread said.

Aside from this special occasion Johnson does served meals Monday through Friday at their 27 Chestnut Street location in Hartford.

""It brings me joy when clients come in with their families"" Johnson said. ""Let me tell you something there’s nothing better than seeing the joy in those kids faces.”

On top of the meal the guests are getting a gift donated by community members and partner organizations of The House of Bread. More than 100 gift bags full of winter essentials every day items and food will be handed out.

“If that’s the only gift they get I'm glad they come here and they get it from us"" Tom Porell Operations Manager of The House of Bread said. ""Because they like hanging out here and they’re part of our family. So we have to treat them like family.""

Porell said that family continues to move and change because of the pandemic. Due to assistance from the state and government many people found a home within the last two years. However others lost theirs.

“We’ve had a shift from people who left us and a shift to a whole bunch of new people that are coming here that need a tremendous amount of help"" Porell added.

That help wouldn't come to fruition without the volunteers who have been coming to their Chestnut Street location for decades.

""I go home to Glastonbury Jill goes home to West Hartford and we go home to nice homes. A lot of people here don’t"" volunteer David Lynch said. ""And it's a small way to give back.""

The House of Bread Soup Kitchen is open for breakfast and lunch Mon-Friday for men women and children. They have weekend hours as well. See below:

Monday-Friday Breakfast: 8-9 a.m.

Monday- Friday Lunch: 11:30 a.m.-12:45 p.m.

The city will spend about $1 million over the next two years of federal COVID-19 relief funds in what could be the first steps toward creating a long-contemplated convention and visitors bureau aimed solely at Hartford. The relief funds are targeted for efforts to spur economic recovery from the pandemic.

The effort — being tentatively referred to as “Destination Hartford” — will be coordinated by the Capital Region Development Authority the quasi-public agency that oversees the running of the Connecticut Convention Center which opened in 2005 on the city’s riverfront.

The Connecticut Convention Center in Hartford seen from East Hartford.

“We know we have to step up our game” Michael W. Freimuth CRDA’s executive director said. “It’s harder and harder right now. There are a lot of people out there trying to book events a lot of events that aren’t as big and glorious as they once were. You’ve got to get more of them to get some ‘critical mass’ going.”

The idea is to better connect conventioneers with what is going on in the city and not just downtown but throughout the neighborhoods. That means getting discount tickets to everything from ballgames at Dunkin’ Donuts Park to special exhibits at the Wadsworth Atheneum.

“If there’s a neighborhood festival or there’s a restaurant out in a far end of the city” Freimuth said “we can work on a special transport out and let them enjoy something like the First & Last restaurant on the tail end of Maple Avenue.”

The effort aims at moving beyond just reacting to visitor needs but being out in front with options and a plan for making them happen.

Freimuth said conventioneers and other visitors to Hartford want to step out of the convention center and know there is a wide array of entertainment options.

“Conventioneers really want to walk outside and be someplace” Freimuth said. “They are not all into getting on buses and driving an hour.”

Losing money

Hartford’s convention center business much like competing venues regionally and nationally took a huge hit in the pandemic.

In the fiscal year 2019 there were 167 events according to CRDA. That fell to 105 events in fiscal 2020 because the convention center lost the last three months as the pandemic took hold. There were no events in fiscal 2021.

Connecticut Convention Center and the Hartford Marriott Downtown left in Hartford.

This fiscal year there are 64 events on the calendar compared with 70 that were projected. Bookings again got underway in September with ConnectiCon mixed martial arts and academic-related expos.

This year’s events are predominantly family events dancing and religious groups CRDA said. Event promoters remain concerned about attendance and exhibitors having their products available the agency said.

CRDA is projecting a loss of nearly $6 million for the Columbus Boulevard venue this fiscal year double what it normally sees.

Typically operating losses are offset by tax revenue generated by convention center events. But the pandemic cut deep so the rest of the $6 million will largely be offset by other COVID-19 relief funds.

The city sees the $1 million as a good use of its relief funds to recover from the pandemic and jump-start the local economy.

“So we think a big part of our ability to recover and to support local businesses and restaurants that are here — and want to be here — is to drive activity at the convention center” Thea Montanez the city’s chief operating officer said. “We need feet on the street right? Many of our larger employers — their employees are still working from home — and so that has certainly impacted feet on the street.”

A cornerstone of the effort would be visitors to Harford “to experience the city the whole city because of our diversity” Montanez said.

“We have to figure out ways when visitors are coming here they are easily able to connect with all the assets that we have” Montanez said.

A new initiative aims to make Hartford more of a destination for conventions by tying together attractions in the city from museums to restaurants to the Hartford Yard Goats.

Making Hartford the focus

The idea of a convention and visitors bureau focused on Hartford had been percolating for a year or so before the pandemic struck.

Even before COVID-19 it was clear the Connecticut Convention Center was facing increased competition including from new convention and event venues at the state’s casinos.

A consultant’s report in fall of 2019 recommended the formation of a new convention and visitors bureau focused on Hartford.

The organization should have a consistent state-funded operating budget of between $3 million and $5 million annually that would showcase the city an effort now sorely lacking Chicago-based Johnson Consulting said in its report.

“This effort will significantly enhance the penetration of citywide events and provide a consistent resource for selling the destination” the report said.

The former Greater Hartford Convention & Visitors Bureau which had a heavy focus on the city has gradually morphed into the Connecticut Convention & Sports Bureau with a statewide focus.

Freimuth said there was a push to seek financing for such a state-funded bureau but it fell to the sidelines once the pandemic hit.

The new effort would likely start small with the addition of one or two positions at the convention center to focus solely on Hartford plus funding to build the framework for making stronger connections between the city’s attractions the convention center and event visitors.

If successful the effort could be used to argue for a larger state-funded organization Freimuth said.

Rebuilding the convention business in Hartford won’t be easy for multiple reasons including making sure there are enough hotel rooms in the city to draw the bigger events.

The pandemic also took a big bite out of the hospitality industry. City and state officials in Hartford scrambled to find an alternative to keeping at least part of the Hilton hotel on Trumbull Street when it appeared it could close by the end of the year.

Last week the state approved an $11 million state-taxpayer backed loan to convert the upper floors of the Hilton to apartments and renovate the lower floors for a DoubleTree hotel.

Freimuth said the new marketing effort is another piece of the puzzle to bring the city’s convention business back from the pandemic.

“COVID layered on a whole new dimension but this is a moment to be a little more aggressive a little more Hartford smart” Freimuth said. “It really needs to be punched up. Right now it’s more reactive than pro-active and pitching.”

Here in Connecticut one weather phenomenon was much more common than the others for 2021: the rain.

This past summer four separate tropical systems brought drenching rainfall washed-out roads and flooded many basements across the state.

Here in Connecticut one weather phenomenon was much more common than the others: the rain.

For the country 2021 was an active year for weather. States saw several major landfalling hurricanes a crippling ice storm in Texas and record-setting tornadoes in the south.

March was a quiet month and virtually snowless with only 0.1” recorded in the Hartford area. There was a spring snowstorm on April 16th that dropped a few inches of snowfall on top of our blooming flowers but that quickly melted as April warmed up.

The following day our largest widespread snow of the year occurred with eight to 16 inches falling statewide by the morning of February 1.

Our coldest temperature of the year was on January 30 and 31 when both days dropped to 1° at Bradley Airport (with temperatures slightly below zero in the hills).

The winter was a mild one overall with our snowfall ending up close to average at 41.1 inches at Bradley Airport. The only unusual thing is that Bridgeport recorded more snow that season than the Hartford area with a total of 43.8 inches!

Summer Storms and Flooding :

June was much hotter than normal ranking 3rd-hottest on record in the Hartford area.

Our hottest temperature of the year was reached on June 29 when the thermometer soared to 99°. The combination of heat and humidity made for a steamy July as well.

But by July tropical systems began moving up the coast taking aim at Connecticut.

Our first taste of tropical weather was in early July as Tropical Storm Elsa moved in on July 9. We had some gusty winds and numerous downpours but escaped any major damage in the area.

A weak but rainy Fred made its way through as a former tropical storm on August 19 dropping 4 inches of rain and further soaking the state. A tornado was spun up as Fred passed through touching down in Thompson. Heavy rain also brought headaches for residents and commuters causing localized flash flooding in areas like West Hartford and Bloomfield. This storm also helped to set the stage for heavier flooding later in the summer.

In late August Hurricane Henri headed up the east coast gathering abundant moisture from the Atlantic Ocean as it neared New England. As the storm made landfall the hurricane-force winds weakened but the rain remained. While the storm is seen as a “dud” in the wind department the rainfall totaled 3 to 5 inches across the state.

But Henri was not without its damage. Heavy downpours caused damage in Manchester as it washed away a road by a condominium complex on Ambassador Drive. No injuries were reported. A tree fell onto a home in Canterbury as well due to the winds and the saturated grounds.

Ida brought arguably the year’s worst weather to the state on the night of September 1.

After making landfall as a major hurricane in Louisiana the storm held its tropical rainfall together as it marched into the northeast.

Several hours of extremely heavy rain led to flash flooding and dangerous conditions.

Connecticut State Trooper Brian Mohl was killed when his vehicle was swept away by floodwaters in Woodbury."

Overall Americans are much less healthy than we “should” be given the amount of money we spend on health care every year. If the recently announced purchase of five Steward Healthcare hospitals by the largest for-profit hospital chain in the country Tennessee-based Hospital Corporation of America (HCA) is allowed to go through in Utah that will all get worse.

As an economist who has studied monopolies and market power extensively HCA’s attempted takeover of Steward Healthcare should be a major cause of concern for everyone in our state — patients insurers employers and frontline health care workers.

Utah hospital markets are already highly concentrated an issue the proposed merger would exacerbate to the detriment of Utah patients. If permitted HCA’s purchase of Jordan Valley Medical Center Mountain Point Medical Center Salt Lake Regional Medical Center and Davis Hospital would leave only three hospital systems in the Salt Lake City market and two in the Ogden market.

Research has shown that reducing the number of health care providers in each market does not lead to an increase in care quality. In fact patients usually see an increase in prices for the care they rely on as competition is eliminated. Skyrocketing prices for lifesaving hospital care harms patients and communities exacerbating existing economic inequities and health care injustice.

Health provider consolidation has already been having drastic effects on health care costs in our state. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation health care spending per person in Utah has tripled since 1991.

Salt Lake City patients are already paying the price for hospital consolidation as the cost of standard procedures has ballooned in recent years. Taking a colonoscopy as an example of a standard procedure the hospitals with the most expensive negotiated rates charged patients nearly four times more than the least expensive ones. The average price of the procedure rose to more than $1000 for privately insured patients in 2008-2011 and it’s probably even higher now.

In other words HCA’s proposed merger would only worsen a trend that has been hurting the people of Utah for a long time.

HCA is already the most profitable acute-care system in the country. They racked up more than $5.1 billion in profits in just the first nine months of 2021. HCA’s hospitals in Utah charge between four and almost seven times the cost of providing care consistently above and in some instances nearly double the statewide averages of prices for the same services. These high charges spell increased costs for the public with no benefits in return except for HCA’s shareholders and corporate executives in Nashville Tennessee.

Increased costs to patients are not the only threat if this deal goes through. The consolidation this purchase would bring would likely harm patient care standards and reduce wages for health care workers. A recent study of a similar for-profit hospital acquisition found that promises of improved care and economics did not materialize for the regions affected.

On top of that after HCA completed its $1.5 billion acquisition of western North Carolina’s Mission Health in 2019 at least 16 doctors fled the hospital and a group of doctors and patients sued claiming that the promises HCA made to get the transaction approved were discarded as soon as they got what they wanted — a hospital monopoly.

The concern with this acquisition is not merely that HCA’s market power will grow but that HCA would trigger a race to the bottom by putting pressure on its Utah rivals to cut costs instead of prices to compete thereby worsening the quality of care we receive. All of this would be done while HCA simultaneously passes more of its costs along to consumers insurers employers health care workers and taxpayers.

This merger does not bode well for the people of Utah. Every one of us at one time or another will visit a hospital. If this transaction is permitted to go forward Utahns will pay the price and HCA’s shareholders will profit.

Looking at the top taxpayers shows some of the largest concentrations of capital or land assets in the city.

The Bexar County Appraisal District releases an annual list of the top 10 taxpayers for every taxing entity in the county including schools emergency districts and others.

For the sake of clarity this article focuses only on the taxes paid to the county. Bexar County’s tax rate is slightly less than 30 cents per $100 valuation following a mostly symbolic reduction in the rate from last year.

#1 Microsoft

Appraised market value of properties: $1.74 billion

Exemptions: None

Estimated property taxes to county: $5.23 million

Microsoft’s tax windfall for Bexar County comes primarily from its data centers which it is building throughout the far West Side. The software giant has sought to concentrate data centers in San Antonio since 2005 when it completed its first data center in the city a 427000 square-foot facility in Westover Hills. It’s built more at a steady pace since then.

Records from the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation show Microsoft has up to five data centers under construction or set to begin construction soon.

Despite the vast size of these data centers relatively few workers are employed at these locations. For example Microsoft’s 1-million-square-foot center in the Texas Research Park is expected to employ about 150 workers when completed in 2022.

#2 H-E-B

Appraised market value of properties: $1.73 billion

Exemptions: $3.74 million

Estimated property taxes to county: $5.19 million

In contrast to the relatively few workers employed at Microsoft compared to its footprint H-E-B is San Antonio’s biggest private employer with an estimated 20000 workers according to figures from Greater: SATX formerly known as the San Antonio Economic Development Foundation.

The homegrown grocery giant says its average store is around 70000 square feet. But its largest store is the 182000-square-foot H-E-B Plus at Loop 1604 and Bandera Road which will be expanded by another 24000 square feet. H-E-B also has grocery distribution centers on the East Side.

H-E-B’s corporate headquarters is also in San Antonio. Its campus on South Flores Street was valued at more than $49 million.

#3 Methodist Healthcare System of San Antonio

Appraised market value of properties: $794.09 million

Exemptions: $31.18 million

Estimated property taxes to county: $2.29 million

Methodist Healthcare System of San Antonio operates nearly two dozen health care facilities including nine acute care hospitals in the city. The system is owned by Methodist Healthcare Ministries of South Texas a San Antonio nonprofit as well as HCA Healthcare a for-profit company headquartered in Nashville Tennessee.

Its flagship Methodist Hospital established in 1963 is one of the largest hospitals in the country with nearly 1000 licensed beds. It also offers San Antonio’s only heart transplant program.

#4 Toyota

Appraised market value of properties: $856.27 million

Exemptions: $146 million

Estimated property taxes to county: $2.13 million

Enticed by local tax abatements Toyota opened its Tundra pickup manufacturing plant in 2006 on the far South Side. The site was originally supposed to be home to an assembly plant but evolved over the construction to become a complete automotive production site. Since then numerous suppliers also have moved to the area.

In 2019 the Japanese auto manufacturer announced a $391 million expansion of the plant the largest capital infusion since the factory began production.

Toyota currently employs about 3000 workers at its San Antonio factory.

#5 Walmart

Appraised market value of properties: $639.27 million

Exemptions: None

Estimated property taxes to county: $1.92 million

San Antonio has 29 Walmart stores more than any city in the United States. Its first location opened on Nacogdoches Road in 1984.

A big contributor to its property taxes is its sheer footprint. On average the company says its neighborhood markets are about 42000 square feet each and its Supercenters are about four times as large as that.

Its most highly appraised store was its Supercenter in Universal City at 510 Kitty Hawk Rd. which was valued at more than $15 million in 2021.

#6 Baptist Health System

Appraised market value of properties: $497.18 million

Exemptions: None

Estimated property taxes to county: $1.4 million

Like H-E-B Baptist Health System is one of the city’s largest employers. Around 7500 employees work for its many hospitals urgent care clinics imaging centers and free-standing emergency departments.

Founded in 1903 Baptist Medical Center is one of San Antonio’s oldest hospitals.

#7 USAA

Appraised market value of properties: $355 million

Exemptions: None

Estimated property taxes to county: $1.06 million

USAA has about seven large office spaces throughout the city. The biggest among them is its corporate headquarters on the Northwest Side which at more than 5 million square feet is enough to take its own zip code.

However the financial services firm — actually a collection of companies — is trying to downsize its office footprint at least temporarily because so many of its employees are working remotely at least part of the time. The company recently confirmed it is seeking to exit and sublease its downtown office on the corner of North St. Mary’s and Convent streets. Last year it also put up for sublease its Vista Corporate Center a large office space on the North Side.

#8 The Shops at La Cantera

Appraised market value of properties: $329.65 million

Exemptions: None

Estimated property taxes to county: $989000

The Shops at La Cantera is a sprawling open-air mall in La Cantera a master-planned resort community developed by USAA’s real estate wing that includes Six Flags Fiesta Texas. There are over 150 shops and restaurants at the retail center which debuted in 2005. A second phase opened in 2008.

While roughly 1.3 million square feet of the land was appraised at just around $70000 the development on top of it is worth far more according to Bexar County Appraisal District records.

#9 AT&T

Appraised market value of properties: $308.18 million

Exemptions: $850

Estimated property taxes to county: $924500

AT&T may have broken the hearts of county officials nearly 13 years ago when it moved its headquarters from San Antonio to Dallas but it’s still a notable contributor to county coffers. The telecommunications company which reported nearly $172 billion in revenue last year retains ownership of several office spaces such as its 476000-square-foot building downtown at 105 Auditorium Circle currently valued at $8.5 million.

Still more valuable are the $131 million in telephone lines field boxes and associated land according to Bexar County Appraisal District records.

#10 Frankel Family Trust

Appraised market value of properties: $307.4 million

Exemptions: None

Estimated property taxes to county: $922000

Based in Santa Ana California the company has developed several luxury apartments in the city. One example is the Villas at the Rim which has all the usual high-end features like tennis courts and a resort spa but also ritzy amenities like a court for bocce ball an Italian yard game.

Other complexes are the Villas at Oakwell Farms The Vintage Estates of Northwoods Villas at Medical Center The Lodge at Westover Hills and Villas of Vista Del Norte.",,,,,,,,,

Hall Senior Activity Center enjoyed a pair of holiday activities recently.

A holiday fun day was held Dec. 14 at the center followed by a shopping trip in the afternoon. On Dec. 16 visitors participated in an ugly sweater contest and were treated to the center's annual Christmas lunch.

Guests at the Dec. 14 morning party played a number of games including deciphering a list of Christmas song titles written with emojis answering a list of holiday trivia questions and unscrambling holiday words. The top three scorers in each game were awarded prizes. Winners could select from cookies turnovers or cinnamon rolls for their prizes. Christmas scratch-off cards were distributed and those whose card revealed a ""Nice"" were given prizes while holders of ""Naughty"" cards received nothing.

The final prize was awarded to the winner of a guessing game. A large jar of Hershey's Kisses sat on a table at the side of the room and guests were invited to guess how many Kisses were in the jar. Mary Griffin won the prize with her guess of 500 since the jar contained 509 candies. She was given a pillow with a snowman design and a snowman doll.

Refreshments of punch cheese and crackers cocktail sausages cookies and candy were served.

Members of the First Assembly of God Church entertained visitors by singing gospel songs and Christmas tunes in the half hour just before lunch. Entertainers were vocalist Margo Thomas Sharon Vaughn on guitar Jerry Yingst on guitar and his wife Charlene Yingst on the piano.

On Dec. 16 guests began arriving at midmorning as refreshments of punch cookies and candy were again available. Several were attired in colorful holiday sweaters as an ugly sweater contest was on the calendar. Most of the patrons present who had earlier signed up for a secret Santa gift exchange opened gifts from their unknown benefactors.

Entrants in the sweater contest were asked to stand up and introduce themselves then each one present was given a ballot to vote for his or her choice. Almost everyone agreed there were really no ugly sweaters so winners were actually awarded ""best"" sweater prizes although their sashes read ""Ugly"" ""Uglier"" and ""Ugliest.""

LaVonda Augustine was winner of the sweater contest with her sweater reading ""Feliz Navidad"" and featuring a south of the border theme. Chili peppers adorned a Christmas palm tree and Santa was reclining under the tree wearing a sombrero and strumming his guitar.

Juanita Whiteside was the second-place winner with a colorful reindeer on her sweater sporting a red nose Christmas hat and sweater and a pair of sparkly glasses. Mary Griffin took third place with her red green and white striped sweater adorned with snowflakes and a pair of llamas wearing holiday hats and scarves. Each winner received a badge and a sash.

Tables were covered with holiday tablecloths and decorated with potted poinsettias. Each place setting featured a Christmas napkin a reindeer made from candy canes and an assortment of Hershey Kisses. More holiday candies were strewn down the center of each table.

Whiteside presented center director Melissa Provence and assistant director Cheryl Waeltz with cash gifts just before lunch. Money was collected from center patrons to show appreciation for the welcoming atmosphere and all the services the ladies offer to guests.

Christmas lunch was served at 11:30 with the menu including glazed ham with pineapple sweet potato casserole broccoli and cheese casserole a roll and pecan cobbler.

In the afternoon several met again and made a road trip to eat at the Hiwasse Diner and view the Bentonville Heart Lites display.

Happy Holidays! We are celebrating a very dear tumultuous season - awards season - and the current wave of critics prizes has left us with some very exciting developments. It’s perhaps not the biggest shock that Jane Campion’s austere sensual Western The Power of the Dog has become such a critical darling. It’s the first time in nearly two decades that one of Campion’s phone is in serious consideration but the film’s remarkable showing with awards bodies and the sheer number of Best Director wins she’s accrued are both tremendously deserved and given the overall trajectory of her career something of a surprise.

Releasing her first film since 2009’s Bright Star (and after showrunning the acclaimed series Top of the Lake for two seasons) Campion’s favor with the Academy and critics at large has shifted wildly over the years. As rapturously as The Piano was received her 1996 bold purposefully hard-edged adaptation of Henry James’s The Portrait of a Lady scuttered a lot of that goodwill and as abrasive as that film is I can’t for the life of me understand why this torpedoed her prestige reputation so badly...

I’m happy for the folks saying The Power of the Dog is a new peak for Campion but anyone saying it’s a return to form hasn’t been paying attention. Maybe I’m waving my pom-poms in a small dedicated corner but I’m happy to wave ‘em here and now.

Before The Portrait of a Lady even begins in earnest Campion disarms us in the opening credits. Multiple New Zealand women discuss their favorite things about kissing in voiceover while the production credits are listed. When the opening credits begin in proper they become a montage of young women posing for the camera and dancing in a glade while the pan flutes of Wojciech Kilar’s score serenade them. It’s an unusual decision an ode to the Isabel Archers of today as well as a fairly enticing dry run for many of the film’s aesthetic strategies. Stuart Dryburgh’s camera will remain fleet and mobile and gloriously attentive to the faces and bodies of the actors inside his impressive compositions while Veronika Jenet’s editing keeps a tight hold on emotion and atmosphere disrupting the camera’s ostentatious visual rhythms as often as she maintains them.

Without warning the montage gives way to the actual film shifting from a pan of the title written on a girl’s hand to a close-up of our intrepid heroine Isabel Archer (Nicole Kidman) as insects and birds drone around her zooming in on her tear-stained face as her eyes dart in every direction sometimes even spiking the camera. Her privacy is soon shattered in two ways. Cinematically by the cut of the edit moving into a medium shot that reveals she’s sitting on the branch of a tree that’s very close to the ground while the rest of the tree shields her from the sun. Physically by the approach of a man who we will learn is an artistocrat named Lord Warburton (Richard E. Grant). He seems a bit shell-shocked when he finally talks to her reassuring her that if she doesn’t want to live at a particular house he owns she wouldn’t have to even if it is perfectly safe. He jokes that some people don’t like moats and Isabel desperate for any note of validation or kindness to give the man says she likes a good moat which becomes the signal he needs to reaffirm that he has been touched for life by her and will remain favorable to her should she change her mind. This in turn becomes her signal to leave departing from what turns out to be a very sizable garden hosting a small intimate gathering and storming into a mansion without talking to anyone. Well she talks to the dog and hoists him up in a fantastic canted shot before she fully retreats.

James’s novel contextualized this encounter with sixteen prior chapters of introduction characterization and buildup all of which is completely expunged from Laura Jones’s screenplay. Still at what point in Isabel’s conversation did you intuit that the soft-spoken man she was talking to was a suitor she had rejected moments earlier? Were you keyed into this through performance? Lensing? Direction? Dialogue? Silence? All and none of the above? Throughout The Portrait of a Lady Campion drops us in the beginnings middles and ends of complex interpersonal relationships and asks us to catch up to the histories of the people on screen while attuning to scene-specific emotional beats and the thick air of storied not entirely knowable lives that clings to every character. It takes no time to become familiar with the color temperament and ambition of these figures yet the mysteries they hold remain as proudly hidden as they want.

Speaking of mysteries I should take a moment to establish the key relationships that the early sections of The Portrait of a Lady are built upon. Isabel Archer is a young American woman who’s been living with her American aunt Mrs. Touchett (Shelley Winters) and English uncle Mr. Touchett (John Gielgud) for several months now. Isabel’s time spent living and traveling in Europe has given her a level of freedom she’s always desired allowing her to cultivate eccentricities and ideas she’s eager to test against the world while still presenting herself as an independent traveler rather than a potential bride for the men she meets. This desire for freedom is the primary reason she turned down Lord Warburton’s proposal as well as an earlier proposal from an American heir named Caspar Goodwood (Viggo Mortenson) though her friend Henrietta (Mary Louise Parker) fears Isabel’s headstrong desires will soon lead her into an unhappy marriage. The Touchett’s son Ralph (Martin Donovan) is a frequent companion of Isabel’s though his consumption prevents him from traveling Europe as fully and regularly as she does. Ralph also harbors a deep love for his cousin that he’s elected to keep to himself knowing her attitude about marriage.

Isabel’s life takes two sudden and near-simultaneous turns about 20 minutes into the film. Mr. Touchett has become gravely ill and is expected to die soon. Ralph persuades his father to allocate part of his inheritance to Isabel so that she can have enough financial freedom to be truly independent the rest of her life - provided she never know Ralph orchestrated this of course. News of Mr. Touchett’s illness also summons an old friend to visit and comfort him American expatriate Madame Serena Merle (Barbara Hershey) who takes an immediate and mutual fascination with Isabel after she walks in on this unexpected guest playing Schubert on the Touchett’s grand piano. The sudden inheritance of a great fortune and her newfound kinship with Madame Merle ultimately places Isabel in the attention of another wealthy American widower Gilbert Osmond (John Malkovich) an unpleasant often nasty recluse who spends all his time curating an art collection and preparing his daughter Pansy (Valentina Cervi) for marrying the kind of rich man he wants her to marry.

Even this is only enough setup for the first hour before we get two time jumps a handful of new characters and some old ones with new designs on Isabel and the world she inhabits. For all its glades of women and excision of the novel’s first quarter The Portrait of a Lady is a fairly straightforward adaptation of James’s narrative on a structural level even as it imposed new ideas on the material. I don’t say this to make a dichotomy between the fidelity of Laura Jones’s script and Campion’s direction smearing her iconoclastic fingerprints all over the novel. Adapting James for the screen has proven a difficult enough proposition that Jones’s success at translating the novel for the screen is a genuinely remarkable feat. The script ensures all of James’s structural gambits lush emotions opaque mysteries and period-specific idioms play on film while leaving ample room for a talented visually inventive director to fill in all the interiority atmosphere and unspoken motivations of Portrait’s characters and their environment.

There’s certainly nothing in the novel to justify the feverish hallucinatory black-and-white short film in the middle of the movie that depicts Isabel’s falling in love with Osmond as she travels an exotic desert locale. Nor is there anything to prepare for the number of canted shots Dryburgh uses though they like his languid camera movements and attention to every flicker of the actor’s faces communicate a lot about Campion’s characters and deepen our responses to them intellectually and emotionally. The audiovisual richness endowed by every artist involved gives The Portrait of a Lady lucid perverse textures while preserving its most trenchant mysteries and critiques with fine-honed ingenuity. One could easily view its overwhelming craft choices as something wild and untamed and maybe it is but Portrait’s choices equally florid and claustrophobic have a very clear origin point guiding them.

Enter Jane Campion who honors Henry James’s The Portrait of a Lady while filling her interpretation to the brim with her own thematic and artistic experiments. I can’t think of a film of hers that’s this sprawling this stuffed with characters and locales that all feel like central narrative engines whenever they appear. Campion is entirely disinterested in James’s juxtaposition of American values against the backdrop of European aristocracy. Meanwhile her feminist sensibilities and ideas on autonomy and responsibility are different from James’s in key ways as much a reflection of “modern” theory as her own fascinations. Isabel’s initial attraction to Osmond feels like a masochistic impulse rather than a duped innocent. For all Isabel miscalculates how dangerous Osmond is Campion and Kidman repeatedly convey a protagonist who would rather be pushed against even punished than given the room to spread her wings the way she says she craves. As sympathetic as her plight undoubtedly is Campion neither makes Isabel a pitiful object of abused Victorian morality or an anachronistic femininity worthy of a modern viewer’s scorn. Instead The Portrait of a Lady is a prickly insightful character study of a woman torn between thriving within a patriarchal system and letting it crush her.

It helps that the cast rises tremendously to the occasion. Kidman achieves a layered paradoxical blend of intrepid unlikely fortitude and tear-stained despair nearly a decade before Birth gave us that opera scene. She stands by Isabel’s impulsiveness and intellectual curiosity while carving out unique vibrant relationships to her scene partners. Barbara Hershey’s Madame Merle may be an even more fascinating creation and yet another example of Campion’s naked fascination with fierce complicated and self-destructive women. Blessed with the film’s most memorable introduction and tragic exit her pauses are as voluptuous with history and purpose as any of her dialogue or expressions. Merle is both the woman Isabel aspires to be and the walking tomb that her most masochistic impulses will lead her towards and Hershey negotiates this with an emotional legibility and presence of self that’s just astounding to witness. Martin Donovan’s observant lovesick Ralph is just as magisterial a characterization as either of these women and Campion’s marvelous scope makes even the most tertiary actor register as concentrated three-dimensional interpretations.

Best of all I think is that The Portrait of a Lady’s many hard charismatic stifling edges all speak to Campion’s talents as a conductor and a collaborator. Everyone here is clearly working within her designs but also smudging their own fingerprints alongside hers. This is as much Nicole Kidman’s Portrait as it is Campion’s as much Dryburgh and Patterson’s and Hershey’s and Kilar’s. I love that this story of one intrepid woman’s fatal miscalculation is also the story of a whole team of artists marshaling such a bold singular modern-yet-period vision of one of the most famous pieces of 19th century literature. We don’t get that every day even in projects specifically designed to reinvent classics or test their audience’s ideas about what they’re watching. The Power of the Dog will never be my favorite Campion film and if it brings her her long-deserved Best Director Oscar I’ll never say a word against it. But nomination #2 shouldn’t have been a long time coming and to revisit any of her works is to know for a fact how long and how creatively she’s been challenging what cinema can do.

There is no true downtime. No actual silly season. When the PGA and LPGA tours are slow there’s a bevy of captivating amateur and college stories to sift through. When that tapers off there’s always a new course to dig into a new swing technique to consider or a groundbreaking piece of equipment that might just transform you from weekend warrior to Champions Tour contender.

And while it’s easy to get self-indulgent about your own year around this great sport — OK I’ll play along I roughed things up at Olympic Club Bay Hill Torrey Pines (with Mike Whan) Austin Country Club TPC Scottsdale Houston’s Memorial Park and Whispering Pines among others in 2021 — what I truly appreciate are the lessons we learn along the way.

For example our Beth Ann Nichols considered one of her 2021 highlights a conversation she had with 94-year-old legend Shirley Spork one that illustrated the absurdity of this sport we love:

“Golf is a game that in four and a half hours you’re a star; you’re a bum; you’re average” Spork said. “In 18 holes you’re all those things. Golf is not a game of perfect it’s a game of playable misses.”

Hallelujah.

And while I only attend a handful of events leaving the coverage heavy lifting to stars like Nichols Steve DiMeglio Adam Schupak Eamon Lynch and David Dusek I was reminded of a few key lessons while pitching in:

From Jason Kokrak:

Laugh at the highs and the lows

My question came out awkwardly. Moments after he’d captured the Hewlett Packard Enterprise Houston Open his third PGA Tour victory overall and second in the state of Texas I pointed out to Jason Kokrak how horribly he’d played the back nine at Memorial Park through the first two rounds.

Since he lit up the back on Sunday he must have figured out something along the way right?

I opened with “not just the Saturday morning debacle that you had but you didn’t play the back very well in your first round either.”

Kokrak sat up a bit.

“Easy with ‘the debacle’ ” Kokrak replied looking sternly my way.

A few seconds later the 6-foot-4 Ohio resident let out a hearty Midwestern laugh.

“Yeah … it was a debacle” he said with a wide smile. “I got into some uncomfortable situations for me and I compounded the problem myself but I tried not to let that bug me.”

To follow Kokrak on a Sunday is to see an affable fellow one who’s plenty competitive but after years of toiling in the middle of the pack has used a slightly elongated putter to enjoy a new level of success.

But now that he’s a changed player Kokrak doesn’t seem to have changed his personality much — he’s a big strong likable guy who didn’t mind playing antagonist to Jordan Spieth at Colonial and was happy to joke about his ugly play early on at Houston. The game is too hard to not enjoy a good laugh.

Kokrak keeps laughing just now with deeper pockets.

From Patrick Cantlay (and his caddie): Ride things out until you get hot

Like Billy Horschel before him Patrick Cantlay turned one hot streak into a career-altering season but it could have easily gone another way.

It’s easy to forget that Cantlay had a stretch last spring in which he failed to make the weekend four times in six starts. He missed the cut at both the Masters and the British Open.

But Cantlay was nothing if not an opportunist. His win at the Memorial will be more remembered as the tournament that saw leader Jon Rahm stripped from the field due to a positive COVID test.

Things got interesting as the lucrative FedEx Cup playoffs approached — his caddie Matt Minister tested positive for COVID and while he was out Cantlay brought in Tiger Woods’ caddie Joe LaCava for the first playoff event.

But instead of sending Cantlay into a tailspin he put together a solid showing at the Northern Trust with LaCava then got white-hot with Minister back on his bag — winning the BMW Championship and eventually taking home the $15 million FedEx Cup after an impressive showing at the Tour Championship.

For “the Rev” (what else would you call a man named Minister?) that meant a shift from thinking he might be out of a gig to financial security for life.

“Never in my wildest dreams” the caddie told Craig Dolch when asked to describe the events. “I knew Patrick was playing well … part of it hasn’t set in yet.”

From Keith Mitchell:

This is still fun dammit.

While covering the aforementioned Houston Open I received an invite for a private event with a few of the Sweetens Cove owners including Peyton Manning.

I assumed Peyton would do the typical ambassador fly-by — the type of pop-in celebrities have to offer up when they’re associated with a brand.

Instead Manning was one of the first at the gathering and his initial order of business was to fill out a name tag. As if others might not recognize him.

Me to Peyton Manning tonight: ""My mom says you jinxed Josh Allen dude.""

Peyton: ""I didn't mean to. Sorry."" pic.twitter.com/8gUgY3uInc — Tim Schmitt (@TMSGolfweek) November 11 2021

Soon after Manning arrived so did PGA Tour star Keith Mitchell who was eager to talk about the course that sits less than an hour from his home in Chattanooga Tennessee.

When I asked how he got involved with the leadership group Mitchell joked that they asked him to come aboard soon after he won the 2019 Honda Classic “because they probably assumed I had some money to burn.” Mitchell is a cool character one who eases through a room rather than charging it as Manning does.

But Mitchell’s eyes perked when I asked why he was on-hand at this event especially since he was in the middle of a workweek. Was he obligated to attend? Was this contractual?

“Yeah I’m not here for any of that (expletive). I’m here because this is fun. This is really fun” he said. “We have a golf course that’s fun and playable and a bourbon that tastes great. How do you beat that?”

You don’t.

It must be easy to fall into the trappings that surround Tour players. Free stuff. Big money. Access to anything.

But at the end of the day it’s still a game. An incredible game. And perhaps the best way to enjoy time with good friends. I’ve yet to make the trek to Sweetens but those who have insist it’s the perfect place to get together with your favorite people.

This has not been lost on Mitchell who clearly has his head on his shoulders.

Happy holidays all. While 2021 might not have been perfect it was another year for lessons incredible stories and some great walks following a little white ball.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmt0ZWNocG9zdC5jb20vMjAyMS8xMi8yNS9uZXctd29ybGQtcmVjb3JkLWZvci1kcHUtcGVyZm9ybWFuY2Utc2V0LWJ5LW52aWRpYS1ibHVlZmllbGQv0gFpaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWFya3RlY2hwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzEyLzI1L25ldy13b3JsZC1yZWNvcmQtZm9yLWRwdS1wZXJmb3JtYW5jZS1zZXQtYnktbnZpZGlhLWJsdWVmaWVsZC8_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New World Record for DPU Performance Set by NVIDIA BlueField,"Data centers require incredibly rapid storage access and as per the latest report by NVIDIA Its BlueField-2 DPU is the fastest available.

BlueField’s 41.5 million IOPS is more than four times the previous world record of 10 million IOPS obtained utilizing proprietary storage options. This performance was obtained by connecting two fast Hewlett Packard Enterprise Proliant DL380 Gen 10 Plus servers one serving as the application server (storage initiator) and the other as the storage system (storage target).

Each server was outfitted with two Intel “Ice Lake” Xeon Platinum 8380 CPUs running at 2.3GHz resulting in 160 hyperthreaded cores per server and 512GB of DRAM 120MB of L3 cache (60MB per socket) and a PCIe Gen4 interface.

To accelerate networking and NVMe-oF each server was outfitted with two NVIDIA BlueField-2 P-series DPU cards each with two 100Gb Ethernet network ports for a total of four network ports and 400Gb/s wire bandwidth between initiator and target which were linked together using NVIDIA LinkX 100GbE Direct-Attach Copper (DAC) passive cables. Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) was installed on both systems.

Both SPDK and the regular upstream Linux kernel target were evaluated for storage system software using the default kernel 4.18 and one of the most recent kernels 5.15. Three storage initiators were tested: SPDK the regular kernel storage initiator and the SPDK FIO plugin. FIO and SPDK were used for workload creation and measurement. I/O sizes were tested using 4KB and 512B common medium and small storage I/O sizes respectively.

The NVMe-oF storage protocol was tested at the network transport layer with both TCP and RoCE. Each setup was evaluated with total bidirectional network usage with 100% read 100% write and 50/50 read/write workloads.

The study also found the following BlueField DPU performance characteristics:

Testing with smaller 512B I/O sizes yielded better IOPS but lower-than-line-rate throughput whereas testing with 4KB I/O sizes yielded higher throughput but lower IOPS statistics.

100% read and 100% write workloads yielded comparable IOPS and throughput. However 50/50 mixed read/write workloads delivered more extraordinary performance by simultaneously leveraging both directions of the network connection.

Using SPDK resulted in faster performance than kernel-space software but at the expense of increased server CPU use which is expected given that SPDK operates in user space with continual polling.

Because of frequent storage enhancements introduced by the Linux community the current Linux 5.15 kernel performed better than the 4.18 kernel.

DPU Storage Performance that Sets Records Enables Storage Performance with Security

In addition to quick storage access BlueField enables hardware-accelerated encryption and decryption of both Ethernet storage traffic and storage media preventing data theft or exfiltration. It offloads IPsec at up to 100Gb/s (data on the wire) and 256-bit AES-XTS at up to 200Gb/s (data at rest) lowering the risk of data theft if an adversary has tapped the storage network or if physical storage devices are stolen sold or disposed of incorrectly.

Customers and leading security software vendors are leveraging BlueField’s recently updated NVIDIA DOCA framework to run cybersecurity applications – such as a distributed firewall or security groups with micro-segmentation – on the DPU to improve application and network security for compute servers lowering the risk of unauthorized access or data modifications on storage attached to those servers.

Grand Wailea Maui

Grand Wailea Maui is one of Hilton's most luxurious resorts in Hawaii especially with its beachfront location and amazing pools (there are nine of them). Honeymooners flock to this resort but it's also a great family destination. The hotel offers many on-site activities such as a program where first-time divers (ages 12+) can receive complimentary scuba training. There are also kayak and paddleboard rentals along with a monthly schedule with activities such as luaus yoga classes Hawaiian games and hula lessons. (Note that although the Grand Wailea is popular with families for its extensive kids and teen clubs those are currently closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.)

The Grand Wailea Maui costs 95000 Hilton points a night for a standard room although those are incredibly hard to come by. This is why you'll want to plan your trip far in advance and ensure you are flexible with dates. But if you are able to find a standard room available it makes it a valuable use of free weekend night certificates. You can earn these certificates in a couple of different ways:

Hilton Phoenix Resort at the Peak

Arizona is filled with resorts that range from adults-only spas to family-oriented properties with massive pools and lazy rivers. The all-suite Hilton Phoenix Resort at the Peak definitely works for families. This resort requires between 50000 to 60000 Hilton points per night. And even their standard rooms are suites allowing your family (up to five guests) to spread out for no additional expense.

The Hilton Phoenix Resort at the Peak features the four-acre River Ranch Water Park with pools waterslides and a lazy river. There are also tennis courts basketball courts and mini-golf. (Note during non-pandemic times kids four to 12-year-olds can participate in programs at Coyote Camp which is currently closed.)

Madison Beach Hotel Curio Collection by Hilton Connecticut

Finding a chain resort in the Northeast is challenging but your family can vacation on the Connecticut shoreline using Hilton points at the Madison Beach Hotel. Just make sure to book far ahead as rooms sell out early during the peak periods of summer and fall.

When the weather is good your kids can play at the beach during the day and make s'mores at the fire pit in the evenings. There is also biking kayaking fishing and bird-watching. At 61000 to 80000 Hilton Honors points a night this can be a great New England option.

Signia by Hilton Orlando Bonnet Creek

If Mickey and Minnie are in your family's plans the Signia by Hilton Orlando Bonnet Creek is just a few miles from the Disney theme parks. Here you will receive benefits such as a 30-minute head start at Disney World and complimentary transportation to the park.

For non-park days the Signia by Hilton Orlando Bonnet Creek has a lagoon-style pool and a waterslide and poolside activities. During non-pandemic times there's also a kids club at the adjacent Waldorf Astoria hotel (the kids club is currently closed due to pandemic restrictions).

The Signia by Hilton Orlando Bonnet Creek requires costs 60000 Hilton Honors points a night for a standard night however many times there are only premium rooms available. There are other Hilton properties in the area that might cost less; look into the Hilton Disney Springs properties if your points budget is tight.

Hilton Sandestin Beach Golf Resort & Spa Florida

The Florida panhandle has beautiful beaches and is a popular family vacation spot. If you are looking for a full-service hotel on the beach with many kid's activities the Hilton Sandestin Beach Golf Resort & Spa has you covered at 64000 to 80000 points a night. Or if you are looking to splurge you can redeem even more points to stay in a suite that offers bunk beds — the perfect solution when traveling with kids.

Here you'll find indoor and outdoor pools beach volleyball bike riding tennis golf stand-up paddleboarding and kayaking. And of course there's the beach.

The Waterfront Beach Resort a Hilton Hotel

Huntington Beach also known as ""Surf City"" lies just 35 miles southeast of Los Angeles. On its 9.5-mile beach is The Waterfront Beach Resort which costs 80000 points a night. This is the perfect resort to turn into a California coast road trip or to tack onto a Disneyland vacation. Note: The hotel is across the highway and not on the beachfront.

(Photo courtesy of Hilton)

The Waterfront Beach Resort is steps away from the beach and many restaurants but secluded in a beautiful resort-style property. There is a pool with waterslides cabanas for rent and fire pits in the evening. You can rent boogie boards sand toys beach chairs and umbrellas tandem bikes beach cruisers and more. Unfortunately though the property no longer has a kids club at the resort.

Hilton Barbados Resort

Barbados is an awesome vacation for families. Although there is a limited number of chain resorts on the island there are actually two opportunities to use your Hilton points. The first the Hilton Barbados Resort is located right in Bridgetown. (Note: This is not the right location if you like to be off the beaten path.)

With access to a white-sand beach and a pool the hotel offers snorkeling gear kayaks and boogie boards. The Kidz complimentary Paradise Club is open between 9 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. The kids are divided into two age groups: The Groovy Kidz are children between four and seven years old and the Cool Kidz are children between eight and 12 years old. At the hotel children under five eat for free and children between five and 12 receive all meals at half price.

This is by no means the fanciest hotel in Barbados but it is a great opportunity to use your points on an island where hotels can be quite expensive. The Hilton Barbados Resort costs 59000 to 70000 points a night.

If you have a healthy point balance Hilton recently took over The Crane Resort as one of its vacation properties. (The Crane also has a kids club for four to 12-year-olds and is complimentary). The Hilton Grand Vacations at The Crane starts at 113000 points per night since you can only book premium rooms. The Crane is definitely a nicer property if you have the luxury of choice. Or if you are visiting during an off-peak time you might find that the paid rate is a similar price and worth paying for instead of using points.

Hilton Rose Hall Resort & Spa

The all-inclusive Hilton Rose Hall Resort & Spa in Jamaica has a private beach multiple pools and the Super Mill Falls Water Park. While it is no longer the only waterpark in the Caribbean where you can use points your kids will still love the 280-foot slide and the lazy river.

The room rates include multiple dining options drinks at the swim-up bar non-motorized water sports and of course a kids club.

(Photo courtesy of Hilton)

A standard room at this property costs between 65000 and 70000 points for two guests with a surcharge for additional guests. Children five and under stay for free but you'll want to speak to Hilton or the hotel directly to determine the extra cost as the pricing does change and depends on the age of the guest.

Hilton Aruba Caribbean

Aruba is one of my family's favorite beach destinations. The weather is usually near-perfect the water is crystal-clear there are a ton of activities and the restaurants are solid. In the hotel zone you'll find many points-friendly options including the Hilton Aruba Caribbean.

It boasts two large ""zero-entry pools"" (they slope gradually into the water like a beach which can be ideal for kids) that stay open until 10 p.m. This allows kids to splash around right up to bedtime and gives families something to do in the evening.

The Shoco Land Kids Club is currently closed but when open is available for kids between four and 12 years old.

Standard rooms at this property will cost you 80000 points a night all year-round.

Hilton Cancun an All-Inclusive Resort

The Hilton Cancun just had its grand opening in November 2021 which now makes this another great place to use your Hilton Honors points — especially if you prefer the all-inclusive experience. Located in the Riviera Maya area you're right on the water and still close by to Cancun International Airport (CUN).

There are a plethora of activities for kids including kayaking stand-up paddleboarding snorkeling a water playground with slides and nightly shows.

Kids between the ages of four and 12 can also enjoy the Kids Club. While the fixed building that houses the kids club is not yet up and running there's a temporary space that is being used to offer many fun activities such as arts and crafts gaming stations and more.

(Photo courtesy of Hilton Cancun All Inclusive/Facebook)

A free night award only costs 95000 points a night and kids under 12 stay for free. This is another great opportunity to redeem one of your free night awards that come with one of Hilton's co-branded credit card.

Conrad Bora Bora Nui

Farther away than all the other properties mentioned here the Conrad Bora Bora Nui is special. What is so great about this property for families is that you can spend 89000 points a night and stay in a suite of more than 1000 square feet. If you want to stay over water that will cost you more but land rooms at this property are quite nice for a family of up to four.

The Conrad offers complimentary mini-golf paddleboarding kayaking or sailing. There is also the free Tamariki Kids' Club for kids between four and 14 years old.

Due to the incredibly expensive nightly rate this is a great place to use your points for a free night stay. Unfortunately though availability for a standard room on points is extremely limited but keep on checking the calendar daily to see if any rooms open up.

Bottom line

I love using Hilton Honors points to pay for my hotel stays especially at resorts. If you use points resort fees are waived and you'll receive your fifth night free if you have elite status. Fortunately all four Hilton Honors credit cards come with either Silver Gold or Diamond status. No matter which card you get you'll automatically reap this benefit.

With more than 5000 Hilton properties worldwide there are endless options for family vacations on points.

(WTOC) - It’s been a pretty smooth travel day in our area but some people are spending the holiday weekend looking for flights.

United and Delta airlines say hundreds of flights are cancelled because many of their staffers are out with COVID.

Savannah Hilton Head International Airport doesn’t have any major cancellations yet but a traveler said they had to re-arrange their Christmas Eve plans after waiting hours to fly.

“I’m like oh my God United...what happened? Why you cancel so many flights?” said Abenaa Bailey who traveled from Houston Texas.

She knew this morning it would be a long day of traveling. Delta Air Lines and United Airlines both canceled more than 600 flights Friday and Saturday. There weren’t enough crews to staff flights.

“I saw my flight was delayed but I took a risk and still came to the airport and I had to sit there and wait for about four or five hours until we boarded the plane” said Bailey.

The staffing shortage is an issue airlines have dealt with all year. For some people the timing this weekend is just inconvenient.

“It just took a little bit of a long time and now we just ended up here and I’m so excited” said Elijah Sils-aime from Pittsburgh.

This time around it seems to only disrupt United and Delta -- a relief to some travelers trying to see loved ones this weekend.

“We’re very fortunate to be able to see our family without having delays or cancellations” said Christina Schuliger.

“Coming back it was pretty breezy” said Molly Lucci who lives in Bluffton

Lucci said it was a blessing to get back in time to enjoy the night before Christmas.

“It was God’s plan for us to make it safely and on time” she added.

Some travelers are home to stay but the ones who have to go back are hoping for the best.

“United and I hope I don’t get stuck” said Bailey.

There may not be a lot of canceled flights in our area yet but still watch out for connecting flights.

Where to go to safely check card balances,"Did Santa bring you a gift card this Christmas?

Year after year gift cards have been one of the most popular holiday gifts and 2021 was not an exception.

According to the National Retail Federation's annual holiday survey gift cards were the second most popular gift of the holiday season with 46% of shoppers planning to buy an average of three or four cards this year. Holiday spending on gift cards was expected to total $28.1 billion the highest since $29.9 billion in 2018.

And with supply chain challenges shipping delays and shortages more cards were expected to be placed in stockings than in past years.

But when consumers will redeem the plastic cards or digital codes is another matter. According to a Bankrate.com poll from July 51% of U.S. adults have more than $15.3 billion in unused gift cards vouchers and store credit. This adds up to an average of $116 per person in gift cards.

Use your Christmas gift cards ASAP

The rule of thumb with a gift card? Use it before you lose it.

The Federal Trade Commission recommends using the card as soon as you can. It also advises treating gift cards like cash and using them early to get full value.

Another good reason to use the cards sooner rather than later: the risk that the retailer or restaurant goes out of business.

While gift cards are often accepted after businesses file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in many cases they quickly become worthless. Sometimes there's little or no warning before a business closes.

“I generally tell people if they have gift cards in their wallet use them yesterday"" Melissa Jacoby a bankruptcy law professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill previously told USA TODAY.

The Bankrate poll found 29% of adults have let at least one gift card expire 27% have lost at least one and 21% lost out because a business closed permanently before they used at least one card.

Check gift card balances (carefully)

It's important to go to the actual retailer or card website and to confirm you are at the right place before entering any information. If you're not careful you can wind up at a website that appears to be legitimate but could steal your gift card balance making it worthless.

USA TODAY has rounded up the sites to check the most popular store restaurant and credit card gift cards. This list is current as of Dec. 24. Another way to check balances is with store apps and some retailers like Target allow you to add gift cards to app wallets.

Tips for using gift cards

If you received a gift card here are some tips to get the most out of them:

The fine print: Read the card's terms and conditions. Pay close attention to whether the card is redeemable only at a certain store or location.

Fees: Some state laws bar service fees and expiration dates on store gift cards but the rules on cards branded with the name of a credit card company are stricter. These cards cannot expire for at least five years and cannot have a service fee deducted unless it has not been used in 12 months.

Bonus cards: It's holiday gift card promotion season a time when select restaurants and stores give bonuses with gift card purchases. If you receive a bonus gift card sometimes called bonus bucks most of these will expire. Check terms.

Protect your card: Some gift cards can be registered as credit cards on websites listed on the card which can protect them against theft or loss. Also take photos of the front and back of the card or write down card details as some companies will replace lost or stolen cards if you can provide specifics. Save receipts with card information too.

It's a fairly straight forward install as I have a existing surface mounted subpanel in my garage with the free capacity and the receptacle outlet box will just be surface mounted and right at the bottom of the subpanel.A question I had is if a pass through ground connection to the outlet box as below would be ok and satisfy NEC or would I have to do the traditional 3 wire pigtail connection with a wingnut?Traditional example here just from a regular outlet from reference (notice there is pigtail to the ground screw):My dad does not like doing the wire nut connection and feels it makes for a less secure connection than just the wire passing through the ground screw (and the ground screw connection he feels isn't even necessary in the first place in our case anyways given the outlet box is grounded via the EMT connection).PS: I notice in a lot of videos that I looked up that people don't even do any connection to the ground screw at all when installing a 14-50 it seems people are relying on the receptacle mount screws to pass through the ground to the outlet box.However I would rather do everything by NEC so that if I decide to do an inspection (when covid hopefully dies down) I don't run into trouble.I'm even going to install a 50A GFCI breaker but finding it is very hard to find the ones that are UL listed to my Eaton BR subpanel namely breaker models GFCB250 or GFTCB250 (which apparently is required to meet NEC can't just install one that fits). It is not carried any longer at Home Depot or Lowes. From asking stores that list it lead time is 3-6 weeks if I want to order a new one at a reasonable price ($110-120) the ones that have them in stock are charging over $250 which is ridiculous. Now I understand why some electricians say there is a long lead time for these breakers or it costs $200+ you can't just go to a store and buy any one that fits. I guess I'm going to have to use a regular $15 50A Eaton BR breaker in the meantime while waiting for the GFCI one to arrive or use my dryer connection (which I tested working fine).I'm in the Bay Area in California BTW if that changes anything.

Bethesda Maryland-based Host Hotels & Resorts ended 2023 with $2.9 billion of available liquidity an amount that President and CEO Jim Risoleo said gives the REIT an advantage in negotiating acquisitions once attractive hotels and resorts hit the market.

""Frankly there just aren't a lot of properties that are currently listed for sale certainly not assets that would interest Host but that's really not slowing us down at all"" Risoleo said. ""We are talking to our competitors in the industry our friends in the industry and others to try to kick deals loose that are Host-type assets.

""We are leaning on our relationships. We're leaning on our reputation on our ability to close deals all-cash and that really gives us a very meaningful competitive advantage. And we believe this is the year to to get the balance sheet to work.""

Ideally the U.S. Federal Reserve will soon announce the first of several interest rate cuts Risoleo said and that will bring sellers out of hibernation.

""It's going to also spark competition for those assets"" that will come to market he said. ""Our point of view is we have the balance sheet; we can do it all. We want to get out there and we want to get ahead of the pack. And I hope over the course of the next several months that we're going to be able to tell you that we've been a net acquirer early in 2024.""

Asked about the wave of commercial mortgage-backed securities maturing this year and next and whether that will drive hotel sales Risoleo said the wall of distress hasn't materialized.

""This year there's about $26 billion of full-service loans that will be maturing and I know that earlier in the pandemic there was a lot of talk of distress"" Risoleo said. ""Frankly we haven't seen it materialize certainly not on assets or markets that would interest us. But we'll continue to track it.

""There may be pressure as we get later into the year because one of the things that other hotel owners are going to have to deal with sooner or later is reinvesting in their portfolio.""

Host is interested in acquiring large hotels and resorts with diverse demand drivers in the group business transient and leisure segments. Risoleo added ""bigger is better for us"" and that acquiring hotels in urban markets might be on the table again.

What's Next for Maui

Host's resorts on Maui — the Hyatt Regency Maui Resort and Spa the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani — continue to skew the performance of the REIT's portfolio as leisure demand decreased following the wildfires in August. Yet Host's Maui properties have benefited from a steady source of group demand.

Sourav Ghosh Host's executive vice president and chief financial officer said 2023 was ""the year of group and convention hotel recovery"" adding that group room revenue increased 21% year over year and the volume of group room nights sold recovered to 95% of 2019 levels.

""It is worth noting that our group results were positively skewed by disaster and recovery bookings in Maui"" he said. ""Group room revenue exceeded 2022 by 13% in the fourth quarter driven by an increase in both rate and room nights and we estimate roughly half of that growth can be attributed to recovery and relief groups on Maui.""

Efforts to rebuild Lahaina are ongoing and Risoleo said the west side of Maui will take more time to recover.

""In the interim we have been working with relief agencies in particular the Red Cross. We have contracted with the Red Cross for 350 rooms at the Hyatt Regency Maui through the end of May and we're hopeful that that will be extended while the recovery moves forward"" Risoleo said.

Host is also awaiting a resolution to Hawaii Gov. Josh Green's threat to ban short-term rentals if they aren't opened up as housing for displaced residents. In December Green said the state needed approximately 3000 short-term rental units set aside for Maui residents.

""March 1 is a pivotal date in our mind"" Risoleo said. ""The governor of the state of Hawaii has stated that if the owners of short-term rentals on Maui don't come to terms with allowing their units to be utilized by the displaced residents then he is considering a ban on short-term rentals. ... On the island of Maui in total there's about 30000 short-term rentals. It's quite significant and we're tracking it very closely.""

Risoleo added he hopes leisure travelers will return sooner to Host's two resorts in the Wailea area: the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani. Host concluded 2023 by wrapping up a renovation of the Fairmont Kea Lani's lobby and guestrooms in December.

""We're confident that over time as the consumer begins to understand the differentiation between Wailea which is a completely different submarket than the west side and Ka'anapali that will lead the cadence of business pickup"" he said.

Full-Year Outlook and Earnings Highlights

In its 2024 outlook Host Hotels & Resorts forecasts hotel revenue per available room to grow between 2.5% and 5.5% over 2023. The REIT anticipates net income between $708 million and $794 million and adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization for real estate between $1.59 billion and $1.68 billion.

For full-year 2023 Host's revenue was $5.3 billion up 8.2% over 2022 according to the REIT's earnings release.

Host's full-year net income was $752 million — which was up 17% year over year — and adjusted EBITDAre was $1.6 billion up 8.7% from 2022.

The company's portfolio achieved full-year revenue per available room of $211.71 which was up 8.1% year over year. Average daily rate was $300.66 which was 1.8% above full-year 2022. Hotel occupancy was 70.4% up 6.2% from 2022.

As of publication time Host's stock was trading at $20.48 per share up 5.2% year to date. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 7% for the same period.

Look Brabus isn’t the sort of tuner that calls for an introduction but we think that a quick history lesson is in order. It all started with a man named Bodo Buschmann who was unsatisfied with the way his cars were being customized by existing aftermarket enterprises. In typical German fashion Buschmann eventually decided to take matters into his own hands.As of 1977 he laid the foundation to what would later become one of the most prestigious tuning meccas in the entire world. Nowadays Brabus’ Bottrop-based headquarters accommodate more than 450 employees with an additional 2500 operating at the company’s other locations.The illustrious founder passed away just over three years ago but his legacy will definitely stick around for a long time to come! Brabus is now managed by Constantin Buschmann (Bodo’s son) and it doesn’t look like they’ll be hitting the brakes anytime soon. In the past we’ve analyzed a bunch of tuned Mercs that received the manufacturer’s thrilling “Brabus 900” treatment.However none of them manage to blend luxury and raw power quite as well as this divine Mercedes-Maybach S 650. The opulent sedan was already an exceptional machine in stock form sporting a 6.0-liter twin-turbo V12 mill that’s linked to the rear wheels via a seven-speed automatic gearbox.Featuring 621 wild ponies and 738 pound-feet (1000 Nm) of twist on tap this twelve-cylinder brute is a force to be reckoned with but the Brabus crew still found some considerable room for improvement. Without further ado let’s see how Bottrop’s revered auto specialists went about improving upon perfection.Starting with the powertrain adjustments the Germans fiddled with the Teutonic luxobarge’s V12 engine to extract a whopping 900 PS (887 hp) and 1106 pound-feet (1500 Nm) of asphalt-cracking torque. In order to achieve these numbers they installed bigger turbochargers and a second intercooler while the cylinders were bored out to 6.3 liters.The aforementioned upgrades are joined by a new exhaust system with actively controlled flaps enabling you to adjust the exhaust note on the fly. Following these performance enhancements the Maybach is capable of accelerating from zero to 62 mph (0-100 kph) in a mere 3.7 seconds. Its top speed is electronically governed at 217 mph (350 kph).In terms of bodywork the S 650 ’s front fascia was honored with a fresh splitter lip revised air inlets and Brabus’ unmistakable badge. At the opposite end you’ll be greeted by quad exhaust tips a new diffuser and more emblematic embellishments. Moving on to the unsprung sector the tuner massaged the vehicle’s multi-link suspension to make it sit closer to the ground then they’ve topped things off with 21-inch Monoblock M wheels.The car’s tailor-made interior has been painstakingly upholstered by hand flaunting high-quality leather and a quilted pattern that looks seriously exquisite. We also spot a set of Brabus-branded scuff plates carbon fiber trimming and custom pedals as well as aluminum paddle shifters – in a sedan that weighs nearly 5300 pounds (2400 kg) wet because why not? This whole ordeal is priced at about $640k but the cost can vary depending on each customer’s specification.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxvYnNlcnZhdGV1ci5jb20vMjAyMS8xMi8yNS9kc2MtZHJlZGdlLWFubm91bmNlcy1zdWNjZXNzZnVsLWdsb2JhbC1jb2xsYWJvcmF0aW9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,DSC Dredge announces successful global collaboration - L'Observateur,"DSC Dredge announces successful global collaboration Published 12:00 am Saturday December 25 2021

Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...

RESERVE – In 2019 DSC Dredge LLC a world leading manufacturer of cutter suction dredges located in St. John the Baptist Parish signed a memorandum of understanding with Deep Diggers Ltd Bangladesh with a project focus of providing an engineering design and component package.

Deep Diggers Ltd imported all the dredge components from DSC including the Caterpillar diesel engine dredge pump gearbox cutter assembly winches hydraulic system and lever room and controls. All steel fabrication including the hull side pontoons ladder and spuds were built by Deep Diggers at their facility in Chattogram Bangladesh. Deep Diggers installed all the DSC supplied components including the complete hydraulic and electrical systems. After a year building and countless manpower hours the two companies are proud to announce the successful launch of two 18” Shark Class dredges. DSC provided Product Support for 30 days onsite to help commission the two new dredges and provide crew training in operations and maintenance.

A video of the launch accompanying this announcement is available by clicking here.

Director of International Dredge Sales at DSC Dredge Charles Sinunu commented “Deep Diggers Chairman Gauhar Siraj Jamil and his directors had the wisdom and confidence that they could produce quality dredges with the support from DSC. I expected some challenges with the first build but everything went very smoothly. We have proved the concept to ourselves and to the local market. We look forward to a very long relationship with Deep Diggers.”

The 18” Shark Model SH-10300-200-56D has the advantage to dig to 17m (56 ft) below the surface deeper than most of the dredges in Bangladesh. The dredges built in Bangladesh will use the same advanced components as DSC dredges built in the USA including variable displacement-load sense and variable displacement-closed loop systems. They are powered by a single Caterpillar C32 diesel engine rated 1125 hp and features a 200 hp cutter drive.

With the advanced DSC hydraulic system and fuel-efficient Caterpillar engine this dredge will have a very low cost of operation which means more profits for the dredge contractors in Bangladesh. This is a game changer for their industry.

One of the Deep Diggers Directors Mr. Omar Sharif (Tuhin) stated “We were pleased to partner with the premier dredge manufacturer from the USA DSC Dredge. I have known Charlie Sinunu for more than 15 years and we always hoped that we could find a project together. Now as one of the Directors of Deep Diggers and the local representative of DSC we can build as well as service all DSC dredges in the country. We are factory trained and pride ourselves on providing 24/7/365 service to all DSC clients in Bangladesh. We look forward to building many more dredges in the future with DSC.”

DSC Dredge President and CEO Bob Wetta commented “I am extremely proud of the finished product with all of the setbacks of COVID in 2020 the Deep Diggers manufacturing team stayed diligent in bringing this dredge to life. We look forward to the future and what it holds for our collaboration.”

DSC is a global leader in the dredge manufacturing industry engineering superior customized dredging solutions to meet specific application needs while continuing to exceed customer expectations.

Here's some help with medical bills: A careful reading of your statement may help you negotiate or even eliminate surprise costs from treatments.

NAPERVILLE Ill. (WLS) -- A trip to the emergency room or a medical clinic can end with a big bill sometimes much larger than you were expecting.

Typically there are out-of-pocket costs to pay medical bills like a deductible or a co-pay. But there could be other surprises in your statements that cost big money.

""I said '$750?! Where's that from?'"" Judy Lindstrom said.

That was the reaction the retired nurse had when she saw what she was billed each time she went to a clinic to have the bandage changed on her leg. The deep cut took a few months to heal.

""I was so floored"" she said.

Lindstrom found surprising charges on each bill including an operating room charge. She said she couldn't get answers from the clinic or Edward Hospital which runs the clinic.

""It was not an operating room. It was a doctor's office room"" she said.

Lindstrom knows what an operating room looks like because she was an ER nurse.

The I-Team reached out to Edward Hospital. They wouldn't answer specific questions about Lindstrom's bill only saying ""Patients may see separate charges on their bill due to procedure codes which are used for insurance billing.""

Lindstrom's insurance company Humana initially denied her complaint. After the I-Team got involved Lindstrom said Humana told her that all but one of the charges were wrong. Her new bill is $250-- a savings of $500.

Humana told the I-Team ""Protecting our health plan members' privacy is an important priority for Humana and federal privacy regulations restrict what information we can share about individuals and their medical care. We always encourage our members to contact us with questions or concerns so that we have an opportunity to research and address issues related to their health coverage working collaboratively with health care providers as appropriate.""

Surprise medical bills can also come in the form of out-of-network costs. A hospital may be in-network but during the stay you may unknowingly be cared for by a radiologist anesthesiologist or another medical professional who is out-of-network.

""You don't know that you're getting an out-of-network service and you get stuck with a bill and it's your responsibility to pay. We think that's fundamentally unfair"" said Abe Scarr the Director of Illinois PIRG.

A new law will soon help protect consumers from out-of-network charges by requiring they consent to them first.

""Thankfully Congress passed a law outlawing this starting in 2022. So there are stronger consumer protections around the corner"" said Scarr.

Until then you can advocate for yourself if you get any type of surprise bill.

""There may be parts of your bill that were in fact in-network that you're getting billed for even though you shouldn't be"" said Scarr.

Even with the new law you should still make sure your closest hospital or emergency room is in-network before you need to go.

Experts tell the I-Team if you are on the hook for a charge you can request a low-cost interest free payment plan. You can report bill disputes to the Health Care Bureau of the Illinois Attorney General's office.",,,,,,,,,,,,

This year began with a level of uncertainty for Navy acquisition as an administration change left naval observers wondering how the new Biden administration would approach the future fleet.

While the Trump administration at the end of 2020 unveiled a delayed shipbuilding plan to increase the size of the fleet it remains unclear what direction the Biden administration – which only submitted a budget request for the current fiscal year as opposed to a five-year outlook – will take.

Still the Navy has resumed a strategy of seeking to divest legacy programs to pursue new technologies and platforms an approach that continued to receive both skepticism and criticism from Congress this year.

With several significant new acquisition programs – including a new fighter aircraft a new attack submarine and a new destroyer – currently in the research and development phases the Navy has multiple big-ticket items to pay for in the next decade as it recalculates a strategy focused on the Indo-Pacific.

Surface Ships

The Navy asked to purchase both large and small surface combatants this year including a request for one Arleigh Burke-class destroyer despite a multi-year procurement contract already in place that planned for the Navy to buy two in Fiscal Year 2022. The decision to ask for one destroyer angered lawmakers who added the second destroyer in their marks of the defense policy and spending bills.

The Navy is also in the research and development stages for several of its future surface ship platforms including DDG(X) which will follow the Arleigh Burke-class. In the meantime the service plans to execute another Arleigh Burke-class destroyer multi-year procurement contract that would span from Fiscal Year 2023 through FY 2027.

The service is also progressing on the Constellation-class frigate program and in May issued Fincantieri Marinette Marine a $554 million contract modification to start building the second frigate in the class. Fincantieri was also slated to begin fabrication of the first frigate – the future USS Constellation (FFG-62) – by the end of the 2021 calendar year. The Navy’s FY 2022 budget request asked to purchase one frigate.

While Congress has pushed the Navy to buy more large amphibious warships the Navy’s acting acquisition chief told lawmakers in June that the Pentagon would likely hold off on executing a preliminary agreement to buy four amphibs until it completes a new force structure assessment.

Meanwhile the Marine Corps remains committed to the need for a Light Amphibious Warship that could shuttle Marines around the Indo-Pacific as they set up expeditionary bases on islands and archipelagos where they could fire anti-ship missiles. In June the Navy awarded five companies – Fincantieri Austal USA VT Halter Marine Bollinger and TAI Engineers – “concept design” contracts for LAW which would come out of the Navy’s shipbuilding budget.

Submarines

The Navy’s submarine acquisition efforts have remained steady with the first Columbia-class ballistic missile boat under construction and the service continuing to pursue the Virginia-class attack boats.

In the Fiscal Year 2022 budget request the Navy asked to buy two Virginia-class submarines and lawmakers signaled they want the service to work up to buying three per year.

The service is also in the early research and development phase for SSN(X) the next nuclear attack submarine class that will follow the Virginia-class boats and asked for nearly $30 million in research and development funding to pursue the new program.

The current head of the undersea warfare division on the chief of naval operations staff (OPNAV N97) recently said the future submarine will focus on blue water operations unlike its predecessor that was designed for operations closer to shore and need to be quiet and have more torpedoes.

“We don’t know the specific characteristics that will be in SSNs. But we do believe that the next submarine will have a large horizontal payload capacity. You can read that as it’s going to carry a lot of torpedoes. And we know how to do that. It’ll be fast. And it’ll have acoustic superiority. That’s both sensors to hear the other ships out there as well as stealth – staying quiet” Rear Adm. Doug Perry said at a conference last month.

“We know how to do all of these things but we have to integrate them into one platform. Speed and large payload? We did that on Seawolf and we need to pull that forward to a modular construction submarine.”

On the organizational side the Navy this year also restructured its program offices for submarines by making the admiral leading the Columbia program the new program executive officer of strategic submarines or PEO SSBN which will cover the Ohio-class guided-missile and nuclear ballistic missile submarines. The service also created a program executive officer for attack submarines or PEO SSN which will manage the Seawolf class the Los Angeles class the Virginia class and the future SSN(X). Part of the restructuring also created a program executive officer for undersea warfare systems to manage undersea weapons and how the Navy’s Project Overmatch initiative – which seeks to create a battle network to connect platforms across domains – will fit into the undersea warfare.

Carrier Aviation

The lead ship in the Navy’s Ford-class aircraft carrier program hit several milestones this year and is scheduled to deploy in 2022 after a series of delays and some reliability issues with key new technologies including the Advanced Weapons Elevators.

USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN-78) wrapped up its post-delivery test and trials phase in the spring before heading into full-ship shock trials over the summer. Officials described the carrier’s shock trial testing – when the Navy detonates 40000 pounds of ordnance in the water near the hull to test the ship and its systems – as having no major flooding injuries or fires aboard.

The carrier is currently in the midst of a planned incremental availability that will span six months before it begins preparing for the 2022 deployment which comes four years after the original planned 2018 deployment date.

Despite the carrier’s progress this year the Navy has still had to take parts from the future USS John F. Kennedy (CVN-79) the second carrier in the class that is currently under construction at Huntington Ingalls Industries’ Newport News Shipbuilding to ensure Ford is ready to deploy this year USNI News previously reported. The Navy has said the cannibalization of parts won’t affect Kennedy‘s schedule.

Aircraft

For nearly two years the Navy has argued it must end the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet production line saying the divestment will allow the service to pursue future technologies and assets like the Next Generation Air Dominance program.

But lawmakers have been skeptical of the Navy’s proposal to end a mature production line and the tension between the service and Congress played out in an open forum over the summer when officials questioned the viability of the Super Hornets against future threats. Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Mike Gilday also criticized defense lobbyists at the time for pushing lawmakers to purchase aircraft the Navy does not want.

“It’s not the 90s anymore. If you go to the tri-service strategy we really try to punctuate the sense of urgency that we feel everyday against China to move to move the needle in a bureaucracy that’s really not designed to move very fast” Gilday said in August. “And so although it’s in industry’s best interest . . . building the ships that you want to build lagging on repairs to ships and submarines lobbying Congress to buy aircraft that we don’t need that are excess to need it’s not helpful. It really isn’t in a budget-constrained environment.”

Despite the service not asking to purchase any Super Hornets in FY 2022 congressional authorizers approved funding for 12 F/A 18 E/F Super Hornets in their final version of the defense policy bill. While the House Appropriations Committee added funding for 12 Super Hornets in its draft of the defense spending bill it’s unclear where the final appropriations bill will fall on the issue.

Meanwhile the Navy continues to pursue its Next Generation Air Dominance program but kept the research and development dollars it asked for in FY 2022 for the program classified. The former air warfare director on the chief of naval operations staff (OPNAV N98) in March said NGAD is expected to be a family of manned and unmanned systems with a fighter known as F/A-XX functioning as the nucleus. That fighter the admiral said at the time is likely to be manned.

The Navy also expects both manned and unmanned platforms to replace its rotary wing fleet. Future Vertical Lift – the term the Navy uses for the platform that will ultimately replace the MH-60R and MH-60S helicopters – is also in the development phase. Requirements include the ability for the platform to operate off the fleet’s frigates and destroyers.

Unmanned Systems

The Navy is continuing its pursuit of unmanned systems across domains including for surface platforms.

This year the Navy took possession of a second medium unmanned surface vessel prototype known as Sea Hawk for experimentation out on the West Coast. Sea Hawk is the sister ship to Sea Hunter which was developed by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).

The Navy’s Surface Development Squadron One out in California has been tasked with experimenting with unmanned surface vehicles to get a better understanding of the concept of operations.

While lawmakers have expressed concerns that the Navy is moving out too quickly on untested technologies it does not yet fully understand the service has signaled its looking for ways to assuage congressional apprehension. For example Capt. Pete Small the Navy’s program manager for unmanned maritime systems earlier this year said the Navy was looking to increase the use of land-based testing of prototypes for unmanned vessels.

Despite the Navy’s push to develop unmanned vessels the service is still working out how it will man the platforms. Small this year also acknowledged that the Large Unmanned Surface Vehicle (LUSV) for now would likely need a small crew detachment to perform tasks like refueling.

Shipbuilding Outlook

While the Navy continued to ask for submarines and surface combatants this year and pursue its research and development efforts for major new programs on the horizon the service lacks a recent publicly available five-year budget outlook and 30-year shipbuilding plan that could fill in some gaps in naval strategy.

The Biden administration’s FY 2022 budget submission for the Pentagon did not include the typical Future Years Defense Plan that provides a five-year budget outlook. Its shipbuilding plan provided to Congress in June only showed FY 2022 construction and potential ranges for programs unlike the detailed 30-year outlook that typically shows the number and types of ships the Navy projects buying in each year.

“The Navy working closely with the OSD Director of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation (CAPE) continues to develop comparative assessments of naval force structure options consistent with Interim National Security Strategic Guidance and designed to maximize the maritime contribution to the joint force” the shipbuilding report read.

“The results of these efforts and ongoing experimentation and prototyping will be reflected in the FY2023 shipbuilding plan.”

While some ship acquisition approaches and planned quantities are firm – like that of the Columbia-class ballistic missile submarine program – the future fleet architecture is likely to become clearer after the Navy submits its FY 2023 budget and a long-range shipbuilding blueprint to Congress next year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2NyYWlnaG9vcGVyLzIwMjEvMTIvMjQvdGhlLW5hdnktZ2V0cy1hLWNocmlzdG1hcy1wcmVzZW50LWFsbC0xMS11c3MtZm9yZC13ZWFwb25zLWVsZXZhdG9ycy1kZWxpdmVyZWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Navy Gets A Christmas Present: All 11 USS Ford Weapons Elevators Delivered,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/craighooper/2021/12/24/the-navy-gets-a-christmas-present-all-11-uss-ford-weapons-elevators-delivered/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2NyYWlnaG9vcGVyLzIwMjEvMTIvMjQvdGhlLW5hdnktZ2V0cy1hLWNocmlzdG1hcy1wcmVzZW50LWFsbC0xMS11c3MtZm9yZC13ZWFwb25zLWVsZXZhdG9ycy1kZWxpdmVyZWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm92ZXJ0ZGVmZW5zZS5jb20vMjAyMS8xMi8yNC91c3MtZ2VyYWxkLXItZm9yZHMtZmluYWwtYWR2YW5jZWQtd2VhcG9ucy1lbGV2YXRvcnMtY29tcGxldGVkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,USS Gerald R. Ford's Final Advanced Weapons Elevators Completed,"Pin 0 Shares

The United States Navy has announced the completion of all 11 Advanced Weapons Elevators aboard the USS Gerald R. Ford. The 11th and final Advanced Weapons Elevator of the aircraft carrier was turned over to the Ship’s Crew on December 22.



The Advanced Weapons Elevators aboard the USS Gerald R. Ford use electromagnetic motors to transport ordnance unlike the hydraulic elevators used on previous aircraft carriers like the Nimitz-class. Compared to the Nimitz-class’ weapon elevators’ maximum load of 10500 pounds of ordnance transported at a maximum speed of 100 feet per minute the Advanced Weapons Elevators can load up to 24000 pounds transported at 150 feet per minute allowing for faster rearming of the carrier’s air wing and more sorties to be carried out.

Additionally the Advanced Weapons Elevators are designed to work with the Ford’s new centralized ordnance storage system. Ordnance aboard the carrier is stored in two dedicated locations with overhead sprinkler coverage and the ability to jettison the ordnance in the event of an emergency unlike the “bomb farms” of the Nimitz-class that see weapons staged on mess decks and the hangar bay to facilitate the rearming of aircraft.

Rear Adm. James P. Downey Program Executive Officer for Aircraft Carriers said that the completion of the final Advanced Weapons Elevators was a “significant milestone” for the Navy the Ford and her crew adding that the Navy-Industry team working on the AWE had worked tirelessly import and at sea to complete the elevators. He continued:



“The Navy-Industry teaming provided the opportunities for hundreds of craftsmen technicians and engineers working around the clock—through multiple underway and holiday periods—to get these advanced systems on line and operational.”



The completion of the AWEs comes partway through the Ford’s six-month Planned Incremental Availability at at Huntington Ingalls Industries’ Newport News Shipbuilding facility in Hampton Roads Virginia. The carrier entered the PIA following the completion of shock trials in August with Downey saying that Ford is “on track” to complete it on schedule in spring 2022 ahead of sea trials training and deployment.

The handing over of the AWE completes a journey started in December 2018 with the delivery of the first elevator. Repeated troubles with the elevator systems as installed in the carrier meant that the first AWE was only handed over a year after the Ford’s delivery on 22 July 2017 with the difficulties with AWEs and other first-of-their-kind systems like the Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System sparking much criticism of the $13 billion carrier.",,,,,,

You can get stories like this one straight to your inbox every Thursday morning by subscribing here.

If you didn’t know semiconductor chips were important before the pandemic you do now.

Also known as “microchips” these little bits of tech form the brains behind new cars phones computers gaming consoles and countless other products we rely on everyday (which are now all abruptly in short supply).

Now IBM and Samsung have unveiled a new microchip design that promises radically faster more efficient chips — and a big upgrade to all of our tech that relies on them.

The challenge: Semiconductor chips contain tiny gates called “transistors” that control the flow of electricity. This is what allows a traditional computer to process information using a binary on/off code. (If a gate’s open that’s a “1.” If it’s closed that’s a “0.”)

To make faster more powerful computers we need microchips with more transistors but to keep the chips well micro we’ve had to keep packing more and more transistors into the same area.

We’re now hitting a wall in the amount of transistors we can pack onto a microchip.

The end of the line: In 1975 semiconductor pioneer Gordon Moore famously predicted that we’d be able to double the number of transistors on microchips every two years and that projection — “Moore’s Law” — proved accurate for decades thanks to heroic efforts by engineers.

We’re now hitting a wall in the amount of transistors we can pack onto a microchip though. Making them smaller is just becoming physically impossible — the ones we have today are so small that 1000 of them laid end-to-end are only the width of a human hair.

“The fact is when they’re talking about building physical entities like semiconductors and transistors you can only go so small” Robert Sutor chief quantum exponent at IBM told Electronic Products.

“Atoms have a certain size and you’re approaching the almost atomic molecular distances at this point” he continued. “You’re limited by that.”

IBM and Samsung have unveiled a new microchip design that promises radically faster more efficient chips.

The idea: IBM and Samsung’s new design stacks transistor components vertically on a microchip with electricity flowing up and down rather than the traditional horizontal design with electricity flowing from side to side.

They call their approach “Vertical-Transport Nanosheet Field Effect Transistor” (VTFET) and they say it could not only allow for more transistors on a microchip but also make the flow of electricity through them more efficient.

https://youtu.be/OF3Zwfu6Ngc

Compared to today’s standard transistor design (called FinFET) devices with VTFET chips would have a “two times improvement in performance or an 85 percent reduction in energy use” according to IBM.

That means batteries could last way longer (or be much smaller) and computers could produce much less waste heat which impacts performance and requires loud fans to keep the system cool.

In other words: smartphone batteries that last a week rather than a day.

“Scaling silicon is not the only way to get lower power and better performance.” Valeria Bertacco

The bigger picture: IBM and Samsung haven’t said when they plan to start producing chips with the stacked transistor design so we don’t know when they might actually start showing up in your phone or watch but it typically takes a few years to go from the drawing board to figuring out how to mass produce chips and building devices capable of using them.

However the stacked design and more densely packed transistors are not the only ways we’re going to keep computer power growing in the decades to come.

“Scaling silicon is not the only way to get lower power and better performance” Valeria Bertacco director of the University of Michigan’s Applications Driving Architectures research center told EE Times in 2019. “It was just the easiest way until 10 years ago.”

Replacing silicon with other materials such as graphene might unleash big upgrades in performance too.

Another way is to specialize microchips for specific tasks and divide the computer’s labor.

“Hardware customized for particular domains can be much more efficient and use far fewer transistors enabling applications to run tens to hundreds of times faster” MIT researcher Tao Schardl told MIT News in 2020.

More efficient software and better algorithms could also allow progress to continue even if transistor numbers don’t keep increasing. Replacing the semiconductor materials such as silicon in microchips with other materials such as graphene might unleash big upgrades in performance too.

Then there’s the ultimate game-changer: quantum computers which aim to do away with transistor-laden microchips entirely. Instead they encode information in entangled particles that can represent 1s 0s or both simultaneously which dramatically increases the computer’s potential processing power.

But today’s silicon microchip electronics aren’t going to be replaced by quantum versions or even graphene any time soon so in the near-term we’ll have to rely on clever new designs to grind out another round of Moore’s Law improvements.

(Shinhan Financial Group) Kim Myoung-hee digital chief officer of Shinhan Financial Group. (Shinhan Financial Group)

Shinhan Financial Group one of the four banking giants in the country has named a former IBM managing director as its digital chief officer to accelerate a push to expand its digital services.



Kim Myoung-hee who spent the last 23 years developing digital operations at IBM before joining SK telecom to oversee digital efforts at the country’s largest mobile carrier is considered one of the leading women experts on digital transformation.



Kim was the first senior women chief to lead the National Information Resource Service in 2017 when the Ministry of the Interior and Safety appointed her to head what it calls the world’s first pangovernmental data center.



“Digital transformation isn’t something we’ve started recently. This has been a mission we’ve backed for so long as we look for companies to invest that share our objective” a Shinhan Financial Group official said.



The official referred to the latest food delivery app it launched this week a first by a banking firm to do so amid a race to introduce new digital strategies.



“Going digital is a win-win for the company and customers who will most likely find barriers reduced when they seek financial services which often make them feel ostracized because they have to navigate so many steps to see their money grow” the official said.",,,,,,,,,

An insight into the CPU initially emerged in November when it was tested in a Gigabyte Aorus 15 YE4 laptop. The Alder Lake chip performed extremely well when compared to Intel’s Core i7-11800H and AMD Ryzen 9 5900HX processors.

The Core i7-12800H processor has emerged once again on Geekbench. Three new tests were conducted on a 2022 Razer Blade 15 gaming laptop (RZ09-0421). Notably the subsequent scores that have surfaced are much higher than the results we saw in last month’s benchmarks.

The mobile CPU features 14 cores and 20 threads while the Apple M1 Max processor powering the 2021 MacBook Pro laptop offers 10 cores and 10 threads. Granted the latter has an obvious disadvantage but NotebookCheck’s comparison of the two processors still yields some interesting results. The Geekbench 5.4 average scores for Apple’s M1 Max chip which are based on two tests reached 1773 points for the single-core test and 12636 points for the multi-core test.

The December benchmark for the i7-12800H shows single-core and multi-core tests of 1791 points and 12541 points respectively. Apple’s processor thus edges out the i7-12800H in the multi-core run (+0.76%) but Intel’s silicon takes a +1.02% lead in single-core performance.

While Intel’s upcoming processor is receiving noteworthy scores across the board it has a distinct core and thread advantage over the M1 Max. Thermal efficiency is another aspect that needs to be taken into account. One of the improvements Apple’s latest silicon offers over its Intel-based predecessors is the fact that it produces a considerable amount of performance while keeping power consumption at levels that don’t require a lot of energy.

As for how the Alder Lake chip performs against an AMD processor the Intel Core i7-12800H’s single-core score is +18.69% over the Ryzen 9 5900HX which sports 8 cores. In regard to the multi-core test the results are even more favorable for Intel’s CPU with a +54.66% advantage over AMD’s silicon.

Intel’s Core i7-12800H part of the upcoming Alder Lake-P lineup designed for laptops utilizes the 12th-gen chip’s hybrid architecture consisting of both high-performance cores and power-efficient cores. With this in mind it’s not surprising that the processor delivers better results over the Ryzen 9 5900HX and 11th-gen Tiger Lake-based Core i7-11800H chips.

Still the improvements pertaining to single and multi-core performance between the November and December benchmarks shouldn’t be disregarded — a +8.28% and +30.39% difference in single and multi-core scores respectively. The i7-12800H managed to attain a peak frequency of 3690 MHz this month assisted by 32GB of DDR5 RAM.

According to several other benchmarks Intel’s Alder Lake-P chips will outperform previous generations by over 30%. For example the Core i7-12700H could be nearly 50% faster than Apple’s M1 Max chip and it also outperformed AMD’s Ryzen 7 5700H processor. Elsewhere the Intel Alder Lake-P Core i7-12700H laptop processor comfortably surpassed the Ryzen 5900HX in multithreaded operations.

The episode quickly became one of the most talked-about topics online in China with netizens on Twitter-like Weibo calling for the government to hit Intel with fines and other punishments.

The controversy erupted after Intel sent a year-end letter to suppliers noting that components made in the north-western Chinese region of Xinjiang should not be used in its chips. The message attracted the attention of nationalist media outlet Guancha.

In a Chinese language social media post Intel said it wanted to “clarify” that the ban was only for compliance with US law and not its “own intention or position.”

“We apologize for the trouble caused to our respected Chinese customers partners and the public” Intel added.

The statement was trending on Weibo and had been viewed 190m times by Thursday afternoon.

As tensions mount between the west and China multinationals are finding it more difficult to avoid politics with Beijing’s “reeducation” of a million Uyghur Muslims in its western Xinjiang region a particular flashpoint.

State media have whipped up nationalist opposition to brands such as Nike and H&M that voiced concerns about Xinjiang or vowed to eliminate the use of forced labor from the region from their supply chains.

Intel told the Financial Times that its Chinese statement intended to “address concerns raised by our stakeholders there regarding how we communicated certain legal requirements and policies with our global supplier network.” It added it would continue to remain compliant with US laws.

“This company must abide by American laws but still wants to make money in China we can’t replace them at the moment but we can fine them” said one Weibo commentator. “Let’s fine them billions at a time and use the money for R&D.”

Intel earned one-quarter of its revenue from customers in China last year and has more than 10000 employees in the country. It has recently moved to shrink its Chinese operations by selling a memory chip factory to a South Korean chipmaker.

China’s nationalist tabloid Global Times accused Intel of “biting the hand that feeds it.” “What we need to do is to make it increasingly expensive for companies to offend China” it said in an editorial.

Chinese celebrities have also been forced to quickly cut ties with the companies that cause offense to avoid trouble from fans and the Communist party’s propaganda ministry.

On Wednesday the studio of Wang Junkai lead singer of one of China’s biggest boy bands announced that it would cut all ties with the US chipmaker adding that it had repeatedly urged the company to publicly express a “correct stance” and that “national interest trumps all.”

Wang had been a brand ambassador for Intel before the dispute.

A deal of this size would secure Italy about 10% of the 80 billion euros the U.S. company is looking to spend over the next decade in Europe on cutting-edge manufacturing capacity to help avoid future shortages of semiconductor chips.

Sources had previously told Reuters that the investment size was in a 4 billion to 8 billion euro range. read more

As part of this plan Germany the European Union's largest economy is in the lead to land Intel Corp's (INTC.O) planned European 'megafab' plant although France remains in the running Reuters reported in October.

Intel said it is ""having constructive investment conversations with government leaders in multiple EU countries"" but declined to comment specifically on talks with Italian officials.

""We are encouraged by the many possibilities to support the EU’s digital agenda and 2030 semiconductor ambitions. While current negotiations are ongoing and confidential we plan to make an announcement as soon as possible"" the company said in a statement.

Chipmakers are scrambling to boost output after explosive demand for consumer electronics such as smartphones and computers resulting from the work-from-home trend during the COVID-19 pandemic led.



Meanwhile EU countries where many jobs still rely on industries such as automobile manufacturing are eager to reduce their dependence on semiconductor supplies from China and the United States after recent supply chain problems.



The proposed Italian factory would be an advanced packaging plant using innovative technologies to weave full chips.

Intel and the Italian government of Prime Minister Mario Draghi are discussing an overall investment of $9 billion over 10 years from when construction begins the sources said.

Negotiations are complex and Rome wants Intel to clarify its plans for Italy before formalising a package of favourable conditions especially on jobs and energy costs they added.

On Friday the Foreign Affairs Committee of the National People's Congress also said that China will take firm and strong countermeasures if the US insists on acting arbitrarily.Pushed by some anti-China hawks of the US Congress the legislation passed in the US House and Senate by unanimous vote early in December. The new law creates a ""rebuttable presumption"" that all goods partially or wholly produced in the Xinjiang region are ""tainted by forced labor."" It also requires corporations to prove with ""clear and convincing evidence"" that imports from the region are not made with forced labor.The bill has drawn controversy from even within the US as it results in an increase in the cost of trade for some companies in the US and has a broader impact on the global industrial chain. The Senate and the House had several rounds of ""battles"" due to differences in each other's versions.The news of the signing of the act came after US chip giant Intel faced fierce criticism from Chinese netizens as the company required its suppliers to not source goods or service or use labor from China's Xinjiang. Even its apology on Thursday could not ease the Chinese people's rage with many people calling for more commercial ramifications.The act means companies are forced to undergo self-review and pull anything related to Xinjiang out of their supply chains - the US is actually attempting to remove Xinjiang from the global industrial chain Zhu Ying a professor on human rights law from Southwest University of Political Science and Law told the Global Times.The bill has nothing to do with justice or human rights but it a way for US politicians to hijack US companies' interests in free trade and force them to kneel down to the US' ideological bias. It also hijacks Americans' right to know the real China and the truth about Xinjiang. It's blasphemy against real democracy human rights and free trade Zhu said.The move also hurts the interests of US companies. For example as China produces 22 percent of the world's cotton 84 percent of which comes from Xinjiang the US' previous moves and hyping of banning imports from China's Xinjiang have hurt US apparel companies.Apple Nike and Coca-Cola were among the companies reportedly lobbying the US Congress to weaken the act.

On Friday some Chinese netizens commented online that they found that American retailers Sam's and WalMart had withdrawn products related to Xinjiang from their stores in China and some staff members told the Global Times that Xinjiang products were ""out of stock"" without further replenishments.The two retailers gave no official explanation as of press time.This together with the news of the US signing the law and the recent controversy surrounding Intel is adding oil to the fire and has drawn an angry backlash from Chinese netizens with many calling for a boycott of related US companies as they bite the hands that feed them.Given the ridiculous and malicious act many Chinese netizens suggested the country register a newly established rare-earth company in Xinjiang as a countermeasure to the US act. ""I wonder what the US will say when we register the rare-earth company in Xinjiang? US politicians always want to boast about 'morality and integrity' but all they have are cunning tricks"" a netizen commented.China's state asset administration has approved a major merger of rare-earth assets to form a new company. China provides more than 85 percent of the world's rare earths and is home to about two-thirds of the global supply of rare metals and minerals.These measures proposed by the netizens which may sound ""extreme"" could have some effects in the short term but they are not an effective mechanism in the long run as those who made the bill want to see the decoupling of China and the US and we should not let them get what they want Li Ye a lawyer on international trade and laws and regulations on WTO told the Global Times.""If some companies abide by the US sanctions out of fear of the law or even help promote this dismaying trend China could put them into the list for countermeasures and ask these companies to prove they did not implement the US sanctions"" Li noted.Zhu noted that China could go to the WTO as the US' moves have violated the rules of free trade and also infringed on international rules and regulations. Such a law is made to attack China's industries and also force US allies to take sides. ""This is an escalation of the trade war.""Zhu suggested China to promote related laws to protect the products and industries of Xinjiang and punish entities that ban Xinjiang related products.China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson said on Friday that China will make further responses in light of the development of the situation.""Xinjiang-related issues are purely China's internal affairs… We admonish the US to correct the mistake immediately and stop using Xinjiang-related issues to spread lies interfere in China's internal affairs or contain China's development"" said the spokesperson.Wang Jiang a distinguished research fellow at the Institute for Frontier Region of China Zhejiang Normal University noted that the law is full of speculation by US politicians. For example it has an eight-year limit and Senator Ted Cruz who is also one of the main sponsors that promoted the bill recently announced he is considering running for president in 2024 which means he could hype the bill again to attract more attention.The US' purpose for promoting the law is obvious: to paralyze Xinjiang's economy and disturb its stability. Wang noted that the economic development in China's Xinjiang region has prospered in recent years with its counter-terrorism measures being effective. ""But the bill has deemed measures to fight against poverty in Xinjiang also related to so-called forced labor which may affect the region's development"" said Wang.There may be more controversies like the one concerning Intel especially after the signing of the bill Wang said noting that some US companies which are arrogant and confident may think their products are irreplicable and the Chinese people's rage is temporary and will pull anything from Xinjiang from their supply chains.Chinese analysts also noted that the US' act has also put its allies in hot water. Brussels' top trade official Valdis Dombrovskis urged caution over EU plans to ban Xinjiang products arguing that such a ""sensitive"" measure could risk a trade backlash the Financial Times reported.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vYXV0by5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmluZGlhdGltZXMuY29tL25ld3MvYXV0by1jb21wb25lbnRzL3doeS1pdHMtaW50ZWwtaW5zaWRlLWFkdmFudGFnZS1mb3ItZXVyb3BlLW5vdy84ODQ2NjAzMNIBeWh0dHBzOi8vYXV0by5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmluZGlhdGltZXMuY29tL2FtcC9uZXdzL2F1dG8tY29tcG9uZW50cy93aHktaXRzLWludGVsLWluc2lkZS1hZHZhbnRhZ2UtZm9yLWV1cm9wZS1ub3cvODg0NjYwMzA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why it's 'Intel inside' advantage for Europe now,"Advt

Europe will soon produce a strategically vital component in the modern global economy as US semiconductor giant Intel chooses the site for a new cutting-edge chip factory.Recent problems in global supply chains have highlighted the fundamental importance of semiconductors which are used in a growing number of products including cars TVs and smartphones. Keen demand and the closure of semiconductor plants particularly in Asia due to pandemic disruptions led to a global chip shortage and forced car manufacturers such as Ford Nissan and Volkswagen to scale back production.The European Union wants to become less reliant on fragile global supply chains destabilised by the pandemic and has identified semiconductors as being of strategic importance for the 27-nation bloc.Intel will select early next year a location for its European factories -- which will make semiconductor components so fine that they are measured in nanometres. Chief executive Pat Gelsinger said Intel plans to set up two production units each employing 1500 workers and costing 10 billion euros ($11 billion). Six more factories could be built in the future raising the potential investment to 80 billion euros.Germany appears to be the favourite to host the Intel site. The region around the eastern city of Dresden already hosts big names in the chip industry such as Bosch Global Foundries and Infineon. Dresden ""seems to tick all the boxes"" said Jean-Christophe Eloy president of research company Yole Developpment which specialises in the semiconductor market.The surrounding Saxony region -- which has earned itself the nickname ""Silicon Saxony"" -- has a significant workforce and real estate potential given its proximity to Germany's border with Poland and the Czech Republic Eloy added. Frank Boesenberg managing director of the Silicon Saxony association which represents local semiconductor interests confirmed discussions were underway to host Intel's project. He cited Saxony's highly educated workforce training and research environment suppliers and the experience of local authorities in authorisation procedures.Bosch this year opened a new semiconductor factory six months ahead of schedule. ""Time and speed are clearly extremely important in our sector"" Boesenberg told AFP. The southern German region of Bavaria is another candidate but its chances seem slimmer due to the project's logistical requirements and pre-existing tensions in the local labour market.A local environmental NGO launched a petition against the proposed factory saying its surface area would be the equivalent of 700 football pitches and its daily water consumption would equal that of a city of one million people. While France and Italy are seen as out of running for hosting Intel's factories they may pick up roles in research and development or as part of the supply chain experts believe."

Path Raises Question: Is This the Next Big Fashion Trend? (Published 2021),"Ermenegildo Zegna is bringing a new luxury product to the New York Stock Exchange: itself.

On Monday the Italian company known for its master of the universe suits became it says the first Italian fashion brand to list on the exchange.

The speed of policy tightening from the Federal Reserve has ramped up starting this month as the central bank tries to slow down the highest inflation levels in nearly 40 years.

The Fed will now cut its support by a pace of $30 billion per month as opposed to $15 billion. It also tentatively plans to hike interest rates three times in 2022 beginning sometime after March.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

This is scaring some investors who worry what the stock market will look like without an ocean of liquidity from the Fed and a zero-interest rate zero-alternative environment.

Investors are right to worry — but they shouldn't worry just yet says Lance Roberts the chief strategist at RIA Advisors.

Roberts broke down in a recent commentary that early rate hikes aren't what tend to tank stocks. Rather it's hikes later on.

""The risk is not the initial rate hike the second or even the third for stocks. It is the point where the increase in rates causes something to break either in the economy credit markets or a change in bullish psychology"" Roberts wrote. ""Secondly without exception rate-hiking campaigns led to a negative outcome. Furthermore the negative impact occurred at consistently lower levels.

""So while Fred [Imbert] is right that stocks rose 7% in 1999 after the Fed hiked rates in 2000 when the Fed finished hiking rates the stock market fell nearly 50% over the next two years"" he continued referencing an excerpt from a CNBC journalist he'd cited in his commentary.

Below Roberts displays the relationship between some market drops and the top of rate hike cycles.

RIA Advisors

One of the biggest consequences of rate hikes Roberts said is the reduction of share buybacks that it causes.

Share buybacks — when a company buys its own shares potentially boosting its price and earnings per share — have been responsible for more than 40% of the market's return over the last decade Roberts said citing data from Bloomberg.

Without share buybacks he said the S&P 500 would currently be around 2800 instead of above 4700.

Pavillion Global Markets

""Historically the reversal of Fed policy to a tighter regime slows stock buybacks and tempers stock market returns"" he said showing the relationship in another chart.

RIA Advisors

""With the Fed on deck to start tightening policy heading into 2022 there is a significant risk that buybacks will slow. Such was the case when the issuance of cheap debt provided the funding for many of these repurchases"" Roberts said.

With valuations high Roberts said the market is particularly vulnerable to a pullback. In the commentary he laid out a number of threats currently face the market many of them related and stemming from monetary and fiscal policy decisions:

Tighter monetary policy and high valuations Less liquidity globally as Central Banks slow accommodation Less liquidity in the economy as the previous monetary injections fade Higher inflation reduces consumption Weaker economic growth Weak consumer confidence due to inflation Flattening yield curve Weaker earnings growth Profit margin compression Weaker year-over-year comparisons of most economic data

The bigger picture

Roberts makes a compelling case about initial rate hikes and their delayed effect on stocks at least during the last few market cycles.

But with valuations at their highest since the dot-com bubble anything could derail the market at any given point in time as he also points out.

One threat he didn't point out is the Omicron wave of COVID-19. Stocks sold off on Monday this week as new cases continued to rise. Investors have since seemed to forget about it and cases could soon peak but if the situation continues to worsen and cities and states restrict business activity investors could be more inclined to take profits.

In terms of economic growth President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion Build Back Better package failing to gain the approval of West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin put a dent in projections. Goldman Sachs moved down their GDP forecast for next year on the news.

Many strategists agree with Roberts' cautious outlook and see dismal returns ahead. Bank of America's Savita Subramanian and Stifel's Barry Bannister are two examples.

Right now the best-case scenario for stocks seems to be one in which COVID cases fall inflation cools off rate hikes and tapering don't trip up the economy or the market and consumers continue their strong spending.

That's a lot of boxes that need checked and perhaps not all of them need to occur for stocks to continue to do well. But investors might do well to plan for the heightened downside risk in the market at the moment.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZWZlZWRzLmNvbS9hZGFtLXdoaXRlLXF1aXRzLXByZXNpZGVudC1pY2VzLWNyeXB0by1idXNpbmVzcy1iYWtrdC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Adam White quits as president of ICE's crypto business Bakkt,"Adam White quits as president of ICE’s crypto business Bakkt

Adam White resigned as president of ICE-backed crypto startup Bakkt Holdings (NYSE:BKKT) nearly three years after taking the job.

Mr. White announced his departure on Twitter posting: “I’ve loved working at intersection of crypto + markets and good to see the industry finding the balance between innovation & regulation. Lots of work still to do here but never been more optimistic about the future.”

Adam had originally joined Bakkt as its chief operating officer (COO) from Coinbase in 2018. White has been described as a prime architect of Coinbase’s growth as he was the fifth person ever to join the now-giant cryptocurrency exchange.

In December 2019 he was elevated to serve as president of the company. In this role Adam focused on digital asset markets custody and trading as well as Bakkt’s strategic direction. His breadth of experience in crypto markets and his work as a founding executive at Bakkt gave him a unique perspective that helped shape the platform’s business.

At the time Bakkt had been adding new talents to build out its crypto platform which aims to facilitate cryptocurrency trading for Wall Street firms in a way that is just as easy as trading traditional assets. This included poaching key executives from rivals.

Adam moved up alongside former CEO Mike Blandina after Kelly Loeffler—ICE chairman CEO and Founder Jeffrey Sprecher’s wife—was appointed to a vacant Georgia Senate seat.

Loeffler had run Bakkt since its formal announcement in August 2018 overseeing the company as it worked to launch its physically delivered bitcoin futures products the first such in the U.S.

Bakkt which completed its reverse merger with a special purpose acquisition company in October bills itself as a “digital assets marketplace.” The company aims to grow its network from around 100000 users now to more than 32 million users in five years. To achieve this ambitious goal it has formed partnerships to tap into more than $1.6 trillion worth of digital assets across cryptocurrencies gaming assets gift cards rewards/loyalty points and more.

The list of its partners includes big names such as Alphabet Mastercard and others. However smaller businesses leverage the Bakkt platform to expand payment offerings create new revenue streams and increase customer loyalty. Although its valuation remains under $1 billion Bakkt expects its custody futures and options businesses to generate more than $100 million in 2022 revenue.",,,,,,

The proposal dubbed “Unshell” would seek to ensure that letter-box companies that have “no or minimal economic activity” in the EU cannot benefit from any tax advantages the text of the proposal says.

“Recent investigations such as OpenLux or the Pandora papers were another reminder of the injustices that characterize our economic system today” economy commissioner Paolo Gentiloni said at a press conference on Wednesday.

OpenLux by Le Monde and other news organizations showed how Luxembourg’s investment fund industry helps people launder money and avoid tax.

Pandora Papers an ICIJ investigation in collaboration with 600 reporters worldwide is based on a leak of 11.9 million financial records from 14 offshore financial service providers. The data unveiled details on shell companies and trusts owned by 29000 people from around the world including country leaders powerful business people criminals and celebrities.

Those people used shell companies registered in secrecy jurisdictions including the British Virgin Islands the United Arab Emirates and the Cook Islands to own real estate precious artworks and antiquities and investment portfolios the documents show.

Among shell company owners in Pandora Papers ICIJ and its partners identified prominent European politicians including Czech Republic’s former Prime Minister Andrej Babis who used a web of shell companies to own luxury estate in Southern France and Dutch Finance Minister Wopke Hoekstra who invested in a shell company with interests in a safari enterprise in Kenya. They both denied wrongdoing.

According to a 2018 study commissioned by the European Parliament’s financial crimes committee a “‘shell’ company provides anonymity as a key element while simultaneously guaranteeing control over the shell company and its resources.”

The use of shell companies can be legal the study adds but “when associated with anonymity … they can be misused and thus entail serious risks of tax avoidance tax evasion money laundering and abuse of social rights.”

‘Unshell’ proposal

Three criteria will determine whether an entity exists only on paper and consequently is deemed unable to obtain tax relief and tax benefits according to the new directive proposed by the commission.

The criteria are: the nature of the company’s income the proportion of cross-border transactions for the company’s business and whether the company’s management is outsourced or performed in-house.

The proposal “will enable us to step up the fight against tax avoidance and evasion by tightening the screws on shell companies – or letterbox companies – used as vehicles for tax avoidance or evasion” Gentiloni said.

“The new rules will establish transparency standards around the use of shell entities so that their abuse can more easily be detected by tax authorities” he said.

If the entity is a shell company it will have to comply with new tax reporting obligations and “inbound payments will be taxed in the state of the shell’s shareholder” according to the proposal. If the company’s purpose is to own luxury real estate the asset will be taxed by the state where the property is located “as if it were owned by the individual directly” the document says.

The new directive will also increase exchange information across the bloc and enable member states to request another member to conduct a tax audit of any shell company.

In addition to the initiative on shell companies the commission’s proposal also included the implementation of a minimum tax of 15% for large corporations that have their parent or a subsidiary in the EU.

The minimum tax requirement follows a “historic deal” agreed upon by 136 countries and brokered by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development last October and is aimed at stopping the global race to the bottom in terms of corporate tax rates.

The EU Tax observatory a research think tank led by economist Gabriel Zucman estimated that such reform in the EU would increase the corporate income tax revenue by more than $90 billion a year.

Once adopted by EU Member states the proposed directive will come into effect in January 2024.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvYW5ld3MuY29tL2EvY2hpbmVzZS13aGl0ZS1wYXBlci1zZWVrcy10by1yZWRlZmluZS1kZW1vY3JhY3ktLzYzNjkxMDguaHRtbNIBWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvYW5ld3MuY29tL2FtcC9jaGluZXNlLXdoaXRlLXBhcGVyLXNlZWtzLXRvLXJlZGVmaW5lLWRlbW9jcmFjeS0vNjM2OTEwOC5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chinese White Paper Seeks to Redefine Democracy,"U.S. efforts to counter what it sees as an erosion of democratic principles around the world are facing a new challenge from China which is seeking to redefine the very word democracy and use it to describe its own one-party model of governance.

In a white paper issued days before U.S. President Joe Biden’s December 9-10 Summit for Democracy Beijing’s State Council Information Office argues that its system — in which all power is firmly entrenched in the Chinese Communist Party — constitutes “a true democracy that works.”

U.S. analysts and political leaders are dismissing the claim seeing it as a bid to make China’s diplomatic and economic outreach around the world more palatable to some of the countries where it seeks to invest and gain influence.

“In order to gain popularity and welcome ultimately influence in the international community they decided to call themselves a democracy instead of changing practices to become one” said Hu Ping a onetime district councilor in Beijing who later edited China Spring and Beijing Spring both U.S.-based journals focused on Chinese politics.

The release of the December 4 white paper which was published in the China Daily appears to have been timed to counter the Biden-hosted summit which the U.S. State Department said was aimed principally at defending against authoritarianism addressing and fighting corruption and promoting respect for human rights.

The white paper offers a very different notion of what democracy is. “Whole-process people's democracy integrates process-oriented democracy with results-oriented democracy procedural democracy with substantive democracy direct democracy with indirect democracy and people's democracy with the will of the state” it says.

In a tacit acknowledgment that Beijing’s notion of democracy differs from what is more widely understood by the term it said democracy “is a concrete phenomenon that is constantly evolving. Rooted in history culture and tradition it takes diverse forms and develops along the paths chosen by different peoples based on their exploration and innovation.”

Some elements of the treatise appear at odds with current practices in China where President Xi Jinping is widely regarded as having set the stage this fall to remain in power indefinitely.

'Orderly' lawful succession

“The best way to evaluate whether a country's political system is democratic and efficient is to observe whether the succession of its leaders is orderly and in line with the law” the white paper said.

And at the very time that Chinese tennis star Peng Shuai had disappeared from public view after leveling a charge of sexual abuse against a former party leader it listed another benchmark for measuring democracy as “whether the public can express their requirements without hindrance.” Peng has since denied making the accusation under what many suspect to be political pressure.

Other benchmarks for measuring democracy in the document appear to contrast with the ruling party’s growing efforts to control most aspects of daily life ranging from popular entertainment to private tutoring. These include “whether the exercise of power can be kept under effective restraint and supervision” and “whether the exercise of power is genuinely subject to public scrutiny and checks.”

U.S. Representative Jim McGovern a Democrat who chairs the powerful House Rules Committee and co-chairs the Congressional-Executive Commission on China told VOA the version of democracy described in the white paper is very different from what is understood in most of the world.

“Democracy is a form of government in which the people have the ability to change their government through free and fair elections a freedom that the citizens of the People’s Republic of China are denied” McGovern said in a written statement to VOA.

“Genuine democracy requires respect for all human rights including freedom of assembly association and speech as well as freedom from unwarranted governmental deprivation of the right to life and liberty consent of the governed and equal treatment before the law. None of these exist in China” he said.

Attempt to shift focus

Jessica Ludwig a senior program officer at the National Endowment for Democracy sees the white paper as an effort to decouple the meaning of democracy from the principles described by McGovern.

“A closer look at the language Beijing uses to describe the concept of democracy — emphasizing democracy as ‘whole-process’ and arguing that different systems should be able to co-exist — reflect an effort to redefine democracy as a weaker more malleable concept” she said in written replies to questions from VOA.

Beijing she said is trying to “shift the focus of how democracy is defined into narrower terms of what a government delivers and how efficient its processes are rather than by the values it protects and the accountability of its institutions.”

Senator Marco Rubio a member of the Republican Party and a senior member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee said China’s claim to be a democracy is contradicted by its treatment of its own people including its crackdown on free speech in Hong Kong and its oppression of Tibetans and its Uyghur minority.

Known as one of the fiercest critics of Beijing Rubio added that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) “doesn’t have a shred of democratic legitimacy no matter what they say.”

Shanghai-born historian Song Yongyi who recently retired from California State University in Los Angeles said in a phone interview that the CCP has claimed to be a champion of democracy since the 1940s when the Mao Zedong-led party portrayed itself ""as the true democratic force in China in order to get American support in the civil war” that ended with a communist victory in 1949.

Mao declared at that time that the political system run by the CCP was one of “people’s democratic dictatorship” following the Leninist model Song recalled.

Both Song and Hu believe the CCP knows as well as anyone what democracy means then and now.

'Worse than Mao'

The fact that ""they know they're not a democracy and they know we know they're not a democracy and they still insist on calling themselves a democracy"" is consistent with increased confidence or belligerence on the part of the latest CCP leadership Hu said.

“Back in the Mao era Chinese leadership was very clear: we operate under a different model and we’re in a battle against you” Song said. He views the latest polemic as a bid to stress the democracy element while downplaying the dictatorship element of its governing model in order to better sell its policies to audiences at home and abroad and to undermine the Western concept of democracy.

“What they’re doing is worse than Mao” he said in that Mao was more honest about the true nature of the regime.

Stora Enso has announced an investment of €23m to increase the flexibility and capacity at its Varkaus containerboard mill in Finland.

The investment will allow the company to increase the flexibility of the product range for customers in addition to expanding the site’s total capacity by up to 10%.

Part of Stora Enso’s packaging materials division the Varkaus site is involved in the production of unbleached softwood pulp as well as brown and white top containerboard for corrugated boards or kraftliners.

At present the mill is said to use about one-third of the total board packaging recycled in Finland as its raw material.

The current investment is expected to further increase the use of recycled fibre on the site.

Stora Enso Varkaus packaging board mill director Jarkko Tehomaa said: “The investment will increase the capacity of our recycled fibre site and give us the flexibility to increase the use of recycled fibre in our portfolio.

“The investment will also improve production efficiency through technical changes in both the board machine and the pulp mill drying machine. Also our flexibility to offer different product grades to customers improves and the capacity of the site increases slightly.”

The company will immediately commence the environmental impact assessment (EIA) and the updating of the environmental permit as well as the preparatory work for the investment related to the mill.

Stora Enso will continue its investment while the site is in normal operation. The final installations will be performed following the annual maintenance shutdown at the site in late autumn 2022.

With around 400 employees the Varkaus site holds the capacity to produce 450000 tonnes of packaging board per annum. The site also manufactures pulp sawn timber and veneer wood.",,,,,,

One of the ongoing global efforts is to promote the use of less polluting fuels such as Biofuels Biodiesel or Bioethanol. Automobiles using diesel or gasoline have been a major source of Greenhouse gas which is forcing governments to promote the use of blended fuels to reduce emissions. For example countries like France have mandated companies to produce such blended fuels for vehicles and are also promoting the use of the same as aviation fuel. Companies like Shell also have taken positive steps in reducing their carbon footprint by a fifth by 2035 which has resulted in the company producing ethanol.

Ethanol is mainly produced by a sugar fermentation process and the main sources of sugar required to produce ethanol come from fuel or energy crops. Ethanol produced from energy crops like corn maize sorghum etc. has several advantages over conventional fuels. It comes from a renewable source and unlike fossil fuels have reduced GHG emissions. With automobiles running on fossil fuels accounting for a major share in GHG Emissions it makes it necessary for the world to increase usage of these low carbon fuels.

Global Ethanol Market is expected to grow as the world targets carbon neutrality by 2050. The United States of America was the leading player in the ethanol as a fuel market both in market value and volume. In 2021 the USA’s market value of Ethanol as a fuel stood at $32187.6 Mn down 1.6% YoY and the underlying volume grew 2.4% during the same period.

In 2021 by market value Brazil ranked second at $16087.4 Mn (up 3.5% YoY) while the other three markets - China India and Germany have a cumulative market value of $7595.2 Mn. The ethanol market is likely to grow in the future as 130 countries have set or considering setting a target of net-zero emissions.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb2JhbGRhdGEuY29tL2RhdGEtaW5zaWdodHMvbWluaW5nL3RoZS10b3AtZml2ZS1jb2FsLXByb2R1Y2luZy1jb3VudHJpZXMtbWlsbGlvbi10b25uZXMtMjAyMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Top Five Coal Producing Countries (Million Tonnes 2021),"Increasing Energy Demands Worldwide pose a greater threat towards Climate & Paris agreement goal of reaching climate neutral world by 2050. Combatting climate change forces the world to switch to low-carbon sources of energy. To achieve the carbon-neutral target companies are reducing operating emissions reducing coal output increasing investment in low-carbon metals like copper cobalt nickel and zinc and assisting in the implementation of low-emission technology as BHP Group Ltd pledged to reduce operational emissions by 2030.

Global coal production was impacted by stringent COVID-19 preventative measures in key coal mining countries such as China the US India and South Africa among others coupled with the mine-specific reductions which led to lower coal production.

China is the largest coal-producing country in the world with production reaching 3942 million tonnes a 2.5% growth. The country’s coal mine production is expected to remain flat at a CAGR of just 1.1% between 2021 and 2025 to reach 4.1 billion tonnes in 2025. The output will be affected by the country’s continued plans to reduce outdated coal production capacity. India the second-largest coal-producing country with the production of 767 million tonnes in 2021. Similarly India approved a new production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme which is expected to encourage EV production and hydrogen fuel vehicles which will lead to a reduction in coal production in the coming years. Other top coal-producing countries like Indonesia the United States of America and Australia have also taken measures to reduce coal production.

Production is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2.3% between 2021 and 2025 to reach 8.8 billion tonnes in 2025. While thermal coal production is expected to have a relatively marginal growth 2.0% CAGR to reach 7549.6Mt in 2025 metallurgical coal production is expected to register strong growth 4.2% CAGR to reach 1216.9Mt in 2025.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb2JhbGRhdGEuY29tL2RhdGEtaW5zaWdodHMvbWluaW5nL3RoZS10b3AtZml2ZS1jb3BwZXItcHJvZHVjaW5nLWNvdW50cmllcy10aG91c2FuZC10b25uZXMtMjAyMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Top Five Copper Producing Countries (Thousand Tonnes 2021),"Copper production will play a significant part in the global shift to renewable energy over the next decade as governments increase production of solar and wind technology as well as electric vehicles to achieve climate goals. Governments and policymakers particularly in the US Europe and China have made significant investments in renewable energy sources and technology as worldwide energy consumption is expected to increase in the coming years. Copper is necessary for transforming and transmitting these sustainable energy sources to a useful final state. Copper's qualities make it the most cost-effective material for a variety of sustainable energy systems including cables batteries transistors and inverters.

The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on global copper mining in 2020 with a fall of 2.6% in overall production compared to 2019. The pandemic led to the temporary closure of mines and lockdown measures across the major producing countries. However production recovered in 2021 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5% between 2021 and 2025. The major producing countries are Chile Peru China Congo and the US which together accounted for nearly 60% of the total global production in 2021.

By volume Chile was the leading copper-producing country in 2021 with a production volume of 5636 thousand tonnes down 1.7% YoY. Apart from COVID-19 imposed lockdowns the country’s production output in the past has been impacted by adverse environmental conditions labor strikes etc. However with over 20 projects expected to commence between 2020-2024 of which seven are under construction the country’s production is expected to grow in the coming years.

Peru is the world’s second-largest copper-producing country with a production volume of 2314 thousand tonnes up 7.6% YoY. The Peruvian copper market witnessed a major slump in production in 2020 due to operational disruption caused by COVID-19. However most of the copper mining activities in the country resumed at the end of 2020 but reduced workforces and other restrictions have continued to hamper production levels in the subsequent quarters.

Strong U.S. economic data also underpinned the greenback.

Central bank policy divergence remained the major force driving the Forex pair higher with the hawkish Federal Reserve likely to lead to the widening of the spread between U.S. Government bond yields and Japanese Government bond yields.

On Thursday the USD/JPY settled at 114.417 up 0.300 or +0.26%. The Invesco CurrencyShares Japanese Yen Trust ETF finished at $81.96 down $0.27 or -0.33%.

Strong Demand for Riskier Assets Refuels Carry Trade

Stock markets in the United States Asia and Europe posted solid gains while the safe-haven Japanese Yen eased on signs the Omicron variant would not significantly derail global economic growth. The new clarity in the market helped revive the carry trade a strategy whereby investors borrow in Japanese Yen and buying stocks in U.S. Dollars

After taking a nearly no-interest loan in Yen traders sell the currency and buy U.S. Dollars to invest in U.S. equity markets.

US Data Shows Stable Economy

Thursday’s slew of economic reports showed a stable economy with improving labor and spending trends but inflation at high levels.

Jobless claims for the week ended December 18 came in roughly as expected at 205000.

Durable goods for November rose 2.5% compared to the 1.5% Dow Jones estimate.

Personal income and spending showed increases for November.

But high inflation remained an issue. The Federal Reserve’s closely watched core personal consumption expenditures index (PCE) rose 0.6% in November from the month prior. Core PCE rose 4.7% year-over-year in November higher than the 4.5% rate expected.

Central Bank Divergence Favors U.S. Dollar

The U.S. Federal Reserve said last week it would accelerate tapering of its massive bond buying program and paved the way for three interest rate hikes in 2022 but this did not roil markets as it did in 2013 when the Fed tapered its post financial crisis quantitative easing.

Meanwhile earlier in the week Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said on Monday it was too early to consider normalizing monetary policy bolstering the view that the Japanese central bank would lag behind other central banks in dialing back monetary stimulus.

Advantage: U.S. Dollar over Japanese Yen.

His wife DeBorah refused to waste it. “I do not want people to forget him easily.”,"Do they make gold jackets for angels? Because when Randall Cunningham handed her the ball DeBorah Little did exactly what Floyd Little would’ve done.

She ran with it.

Cunningham the longtime NFL quarterback with the Eagles Vikings Cowboys and Ravens is currently the senior pastor at Remnant Ministries in Las Vegas. Which also happens to be the house of worship for DeBorah widow of Floyd Little The Franchise. The late legendary Broncos tailback who’d put a team on his back for nine seasons passed away on New Year’s Day 2021 at the age of 78 after a battle with cancer.

“He knew what I was going through” DeBorah said. “And when Floyd was sick (with cancer) and then afterward (Randall) had shared his own stories because he had a son who’d passed away (as a toddler). And he was a tremendous comfort.”

As it turns out Cunningham and his wife Felicity had been thinking about starting up a ministry at the church for widows survivors of loss. A few months ago they decided they’d found the perfect shepherd.

“And Randall called me one day and said ‘Listen there’s a need for a widows ministry at Remnant is that something you would be willing to head up?’” DeBorah said.

“(He said) ‘You’ve done a tremendous job of healing. I know you’re still going through it DeBorah. But you still show up at church. You’re still in Bible study. You’re still teaching in the youth ministry. You’re the kind of believer that we need.’ So many members of the church had lost people.”

According to CDC data as of Dec. 23 the state of Nevada ranked No. 19 in the country in the rate of COVID-related deaths per 100000 citizens (221) since Jan. 21 2020. (Colorado checked in at No. 41 at 174 per 100K.)

Which is the short version of how Little’s Celebration of Life ministry got off the ground. And into the water.

DeBorah recently spearheaded a short cruise on Lake Las Vegas for roughly 30 widows such as herself — a chance to get some fresh air to love to learn and to listen.

Some had lost their husbands in the last three months. For others it had been three years. Or longer.

“It was just a wonderful time” she said. “So I’ve begun the work of just sitting still and being quiet and saying ‘OK Lord I said is this really what you would have me to do?’ And I believe the answer is yes.”

***

Next December she’ll get back to decorations. Maybe even a tree. She’s a year away emotionally from putting out a holiday newsletter again.

“Christmas and New Year’s will never be the same” said DeBorah who spent the holidays of 2020 watching the strongest man she’d ever known fade away.

“I just loved everything about him. The way he would hold my hands. He would hold it tight. It wasn’t one of those ‘noodle’ hands. We did everything together … you don’t replace that. You do not replace that.

“What I will tell you is that with every fiber of my being I will be doing everything I can to be keeping the spirit of Floyd alive his memory alive his legacy alive. I do not want people to forget him easily.”

This past August during Pro Football Hall of Fame Enshrinement weekend DeBorah partnered with LaTresa Doleman and Tara Greene widows of Hall-of-Fame defenders Chris Doleman and Kevin Greene to collaborate with the YWCA Canton on a “Women Empowering Women” panel.

Volunteers read to children at the Y. DeBorah bought the kids backpacks. She got the Hall involved.

“It became more than just a lunch. Or a fashion show” said Little whose husband had been inducted back in 2010. “We wanted to work. We wanted to do community service.”

She started regular Zoom calls with fellow NFL widows giving advice she had to learn the hard way. Sharing tips she wished she’d known years earlier.

“Be around other people” DeBorah said. “Don’t be alone. And if there’s someone with you who is grieving hug them. They need hugs. They need love.

“Probably the first six or seven months of the year I didn’t even want to consider a future without Floyd. What I have learned is to accept the invitations from other people to have lunch to have coffee.

“You get out of the house you get some fresh air get your mind off your problems for an hour two hours you get to giggle you get to laugh. And even if you feel guilty about it because I did there’s some joy in there. Even a hint a mustard seed of joy is better than none at all.”

***

The Paris junket was one of those seeds. A chance to push the re-set button. To honor Floyd. To pray. To heal.

The Littles had decided a while ago that they had enough stuff so a few years back they shifted from gifts to travel. Couples trips.

“Floyd visits me everywhere I go and in everything I do” Little said. “And I heard the spirit of Floyd say ‘OK here’s the thing: Whenever you see the number 44 you know that I’m with you.’”

Which DeBorah explained is why she was calling from France. She had rented out a one-bedroom apartment in the capital this December sight-seeing with her cousin Natasha.

“I came here specifically to sit still and get quiet to read The Word of The Lord and listen. To hear what He tells me about what I’m supposed to be doing His plans for my life in 2022” she said. “Jeremiah 29:11.”

For I know the plans I have for you … plans to prosper you and not to harm you plans to give you hope and a future.

DeBorah recalled getting off a Parisian subway car a few weeks back when she spotted a quiet woman near the platform. As Little passed the stranger suddenly broke into a rendition of the Etta James classic “At Last.”

Myyyyy love has come along …

It was her wedding song.

“And I get up the steps to go to get on the next train and this music is starting” DeBorah said. “And I turned around and looked at my cousin and I went ‘My gosh Natasha.’”

I found a thrill to press my cheek to …

“I don’t want to feel guilty for feeling joy” DeBorah said. “I just have to be strong because I haven’t really fully accepted it yet. But I have to.

“He’s watching over me.”

With that the voice on the other line choked back tears from half a world away.

The separation clause won’t apply if the merger fails to secure shareholder and regulatory approvals two senior Zee executives said seeking anonymity.

“Well not on account of shareholder approval etc. It does not lead to any liability. But in the event we breach then there could be"" Zee’s chief executive Punit Goenka told analysts on 22 September in response to a question on the liabilities on the company if the merger fails.

“There is an exclusivity obligation on each other and there is a penalty associated with it"" Zee’s head of mergers and acquisitions Vikas Somani clarified on the investor call.

Somani did not quantify the penalty but it is $100 million according to a person familiar with the deal. He declined to be named. Break-up fee is typically included in large acquisitions.

Emails sent to spokespeople for Zee and Sony seeking comment went unanswered.

The binding merger agreement envisages Sony owning a 51% stake in the combined company while Zee founder Subhash Chandra and his family have a 4% interest leaving the remaining 45% shares with the current shareholders of Zee.

Zee’s Goenka will lead the combined company as CEO while Sony will appoint the majority of the directors on the merged entity’s board.

Zee expects to complete the merger within 8-10 months during which it expects to get approvals from the regulators including the Competition Commission of India the broadcasting ministry stock exchanges and the National Company Law Tribunal.

The future of this merged entity rests on the real owners of Zee: the shareholders. For now Zee has not disclosed by when it expects to put this merger to vote before shareholders.

The role of Zee’s largest shareholder Invesco the American fund manager which owns 17.88% becomes crucial. Invesco which first revolted against Zee and demanded a special shareholder meeting in September has not said whether it will vote on the deal after Zee and Sony signed a definite agreement on 21 September.

An email sent to Invesco seeking comment went unanswered.

In a letter dated 11 September Invesco first demanded that Zee hold a special shareholder meeting reconstitute its current board remove Goenka and induct six independent directors. Over the last 100 days Zee has refused to cede to Invesco’s demands and both parties are locked in legal fights before a company court in Mumbai and the Bombay high court.

Most analysts are bullish on the prospects of the merged entity which will also become the country’s largest listed media firm.

“The merged entity’s ability to spend ₹3000 crore annually is similar to Netflix’s ₹3000 crore India content investment over the last two years"" Motilal Oswal’s analysts Aliasgar Shakir and Harsh Gokalgandhi wrote in a 22 December note.

However many believe that a lot of the success of the merged entity rests on how the merged entity improves its corporate governance records. Zee in the past has been plagued with questionable corporate governance policies prompting three independent directors to resign in December 2019.

“Improving corporate governance and operational performance could significantly aid in the long run"" the analysts with Motilal Oswal wrote in the note.

The private-equity giant has held a significant ownership stake in 10 companies that went public on the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq this year including one business that got sold to a so-called SPAC or special-purpose acquisition company.

Half of those companies — including the Bumble dating app and the Oatly oat drink brand — are now trading well below their offering prices. Indeed four of them have fallen more than 30 percent over the past 90 days including Oatly whose stock has plunged 50 percent to $8.14 from $16.30 while Bumble has dropped 35 percent during that same period to $34.87 from $53.50.

That’s in sharp contrast to the S&P 500 which is up 24 percent on the year and the Nasdaq which rose 19 percent.

To be sure the IPO aftermarket has been a disappointment this year across the board. While nearly 1000 companies went public in 2021 — an unprecedented crop of deals that raised a record $300 billion in proceeds — their stocks were down 20 percent this year versus the S&P 500 according to University of Florida Professor Jay Ritter who is known as “Mr. IPO” for his work on initial public offerings.

Many newly listed companies especially in tech and health care have not grown quickly enough to justify their lofty trailing revenue trading multiples some of which exceeded 20 times earnings Ritter said. The Renaissance IPO exchange-traded fund which tracks recent IPOs is off 9 percent this year.

“Investors were buying IPOs on a lot of optimistic assumptions” Ritter told The Post.

Still Blackstone has left itself open to criticism especially when listing companies it has invested in through its growth fund.

Oatly which listed its shares in May missed earnings forecasts in its most recent quarter. Last month Oatly revealed in a securities filing that it was forced to conduct a limited recall related to “loose metal items” found in its milk-processing equipment.

Meanwhile Bumble — founded by tech entrepreneur Whitney Wolfe — posted a decline in overall user growth in its third quarter with analysts fretting that its pandemic-driven user growth isn’t sustainable. Total paying users dropping to 2.87 million in the three months through September down from 2.93 million in the prior quarter.

Shortly after its February IPO Bumble traded as high as $84.80 a share. On Thursday the dating app closed at $34.87.

Sema4 Holdings a genetic-testing business spun out of Mount Sinai Health Systems merged with a blank-check company and started trading in July. Sema4 lost $89 million in operating profit last quarter on $43 million of revenue and also loses money at the gross margin level. Some investors fret that the company may not be able to renew big contracts it won during the pandemic.

“The interesting thing is the root cause of the poor stock price performance in all of these appears to be operational execution missteps and poor business models and not market changes” one IPO investor remarked. “Why are some of these companies public? ”

Sema4 shares in the last 90 days have fallen by more than 40 percent to $4.67.

Blackstone told The Post its 2021 IPOs have delivered “exceptional absolute and relative performance” — calculating that they are up 32 percent on average from when they went public.

That stat however includes auto technology company Sona Comstar which listed its shares on the National Stock Exchange of India.

Elsewhere Blackstone’s biggest winners include Texas-based business process outsourcing company TaskUs which since its June IPO is up 115 percent. Health company Apria is up 53 percent year to date and Imago Biosciences is up 45 percent on the year and is still rising.

“Many of these IPOs are high-growth technology and life-sciences businesses — with those sectors and many other IPOs seeing similar retracement in the fourth quarter nearly across the board” a Blackstone spokesman said.

“We also believe these companies are well positioned for long-term success and continue to be substantial stockholders in alignment with their public shareholders.”

More broadly Blackstone pointed to its “strong track record of helping build many highly successful public companies for the long-term” citing Hilton whose IPO investors it said have tripled their money. Blackstone-backed Tradeweb is trading at nearly 4 times its IPO price and Invitation Homes has more than doubled according to the Blackstone spokesman.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdyb3d0aHNwb3R0ZXIuY29tLzIwMjEvMTIvMjQvb3JhbmdlLWNvdW50eXMtdG9wLTEwLW1vc3QtZXhwZW5zaXZlLWhvbWUtc2FsZXMtaW4tMjAyMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Orange County's Top 10 most expensive home sales in 2021,"Orange County’s luxury residential scene demanded some high prices in 2021.

Low-interest rates and elaborate marketing campaigns with flashy home showing parties and prop Lamborghinis set the stage for an extremely hot year in the luxury real estate market.

Wealthy buyers were enchanted by Disney’s Golden Oak community and drawn to the homes of pro-athletes and local developers.

Although Golden Oak had the highest volume of deals across the top ten most expensive homes sales in 2021 the highest prices took place elsewhere in places like Orlando Winter Park and Windermere.

The Colorado Western Slope boasts a gorgeous winter wonderland filled with challenging and exciting activities for the avid sport enthusiast. Make Grand Junction your base and ski skate sled and swim all season long in Western Colorado!

Once you’re up and over the Continental Divide on its western side you’re officially on Colorado’s Western Slope. Although vast in size it contains the minority of the state’s population. This creates gems that are mostly away from the crowds.

Most of the destinations can be reached in 4-6 hours from Denver. Grand Junction is about a 5 hour drive. You can also fly closer to these gems via Colorado’s regional commercial airports.

If you’re looking for one of the more unusual winter experiences off-the-beaten path than definitely considering basing in Grand Junction for a few days. You can experience the largest flat topped mountain in the world Grand Mesa a variety of winter ways from snowshoeing to downhill skiing. Or just take a scenic auto tour from one side to the other.

Some distances for reference (using Google Maps estimated drive time):

Denver –> Grand Junction ~ 4H 7M

Grand Junction –> Aspen ~ 2H 12M

Grand Junction –> Crested Butte ~ 2H 53M

Grand Junction –> Glenwood Springs ~ 1H 19M

Grand Junction –> Gunnison ~ 2H 22M

Grand Junction –> Lake City ~ 2H 52M

Grand Junction –> Mesa ~ 0H 36M

Grand Junction –> Ouray ~ 1H 50M

Grand Junction –> Silverton ~ 2H 32M

Grand Junction –> Telluride ~ 2H 27M

Western Colorado is seldom visited in comparison to the Front Range and Summit County but the natural beauty is expansive. We’ll focus mainly on the Central Western Slope destinations or the region around Grand Junction but also include other western gems worth visiting or staying at altogether.

Winter Activities near Grand Junction CO

We left the Southwest Colorado hot spots of Durango and Pagosa Springs off this list because we had to draw the line somewhere and they are the furtherest south and not in the realm of Grand Junction. But they both make incredible winter destinations with skiing at Purgatory and Wolf Creek respectively.

You’ll find that for most snow based winter activities you’ll get out of Grand Junction’s lower 4583′ elevation up into the high country. Much like most people don’t stick around Denver for snow sports but instead road trip it up into the mountains. Although GJ makes a fine vantage point for soaking up Colorado National Monument which is open year round.

Here are some things to do in winter in Western Colorado:

1. Downhill Skiing & Snowboarding

Whoosh! this adrenaline-charged experience is plentiful throughout the region. With 250 inches of average snowfall each year Powderhorn Resort in Mesa provides the closest ski resort to Grand Junction. From novice to expert this is a great destination for downhill skiing and snowboarding notably because of its 1600 acres of trails and light dry snow. The views from atop the Grand Mesa which you are skiing down are exception. Snowshoeing and cross country skiing can also be found nearby.

Downhill skiing and snowboarding is extraordinary at Crested Butte Mountain Resort in Gunnison County. It’s perfect for everyone including individuals couples families and large groups. The town is lovely and the people are friendly and laid-back. There’s also excellent backcountry skiing.

Enjoy some of the deepest steepest terrain for skiers at Telluride Ski Resort in San Miguel County. This one’s tucked way in the southwest part of the state in the steep and Swiss-like San Juan Mountains. Anyone from experts to family will find terrain and memories that’ll last a lifetime.

For probably the best beginner skiing as well as some of the best tree skiing in the state consider Sunlight Mountain Resort in Garfield County. It offers 67 trails for downhill fun and presents you with one of the longest trails in ski country. Like Powderhorn it’s known for its drier snow which is always better to ski on. There are a myriad of other activities nearby like snowmobiling and the heavenly hot springs that Glenwood Springs is famous for.

Aspen features four ski resorts all under the same Aspen/Snowmass lift ticket. Beginners go to Buttermilk or Snowmass while experts will be amongst other skill levels at Aspen Mountain and Aspen Highlands.

The most gnarly expert skiers can take backcountry-like guided powder turns at a resort. That resort being Silverton Mountain. This one-of-a-kind ski area has only 1 chairlift to the top requires all riders to wear a pack with backcountry safety gear (you can rent it here) and go out with a guide during peak season.

2. Nordic Skiing & Snowshoeing

Delta County is the site of more than 30 miles of trails for cross country skiing and snowshoeing on the Grand Mesa. The Grand Mesa Nordic Council grooms these trails which are open for public use all winter long.

Glenwood Springs’ Sunlight Mountain Resort offers up cross country skiing for all levels of Nordic fans in Babbish Gulch valley. You can rent both Nordic skis and snowshoes to be used on the shared trails.

Crested Butte offers so much for the winter activity enthusiast and only 30 minutes north of Gunnison which has an airport and under 5 hours from Denver. It prides itself on being the “Nordic Ski Capital of Colorado” with 55 kilometers of trails available for the cross country skier. There’s also snowshoeing for a great workout and wildlife watching.

In winter Black Canyon of Gunnison is a great spot for cross country skiing and snowshoeing. Visit Colorado’s most least visited national park during its least visited season for a winter wonderland all to yourself.

You can also go snowshoeing and cross country skiing in the San Juan Mountains by Ouray. The Ouray County Nordic Council donates their time and resources to grooming multi-use trails for your enjoyment all winter long. Just up Highway 550 from Ouray lies Ridgway and Nordic skiing at Top of the Pines.

Farther south on the Million Dollar Highway from Ouray lies the sleepy town of Silverton. Mostly locals and some warmly welcomed visitors take to the uncrowded trails at Ski Kendall Nordic for shared cross country skiing and snowshoeing fun. It’s also a tiny ski area too perfect for true beginners.

At the southern end of the Roaring Fork Valley lies the Aspen Cross Country Center. It’s the only full service cross country ski and snowshoe resort in town.

3. Snowmobiling

There are hundreds of miles to explore in the Grand Mesa National Forest. Snowmobiles are permitted on several trails throughout. The trails connect to Vega State Park Powderhorn the Sunlight Mountain Resort and 180 miles of additional trail. It’s amazing riding!

Enjoy this exhilarating sport in several locations throughout the Western Slope. Go barreling through the White River National Forest with the Sunlight Mountain Snowmobile Tours in Glenwood Springs. This fun filled trek is a crowd pleaser in one of the most well equipped towns for snow sports (thanks to its apres-sport hot springs).

Ouray is a solid spot for snowmobiling too in the “Switzerland of America” with both groomed and ungroomed trails. Telluride is another snowmobiling destination on the Western Slope providing some special adventures. Unique guided tours are hosted by Telluride Outfitters including both a ghost town tour and hot springs tour via snowmobile.

Gunnison Hinsdale and Montrose Counties also offer snowmobiling trails with Lake City being a low key world class snowmobile destination. There are more than 100 miles of groomed trails linking the expansive backcountry between Lake City and Creede in the middle of the Rocky Mountain emptiness. You can rent snowmobiles in town at Lake City Auto Sports Center. There’s also a tiny ski hill in town if you’d like to feel what skiing used to be like.

Gunnison County makes for a splendid snowmobiling holiday. Go on tours through CB Motorsports in Crested Butte and Colorado Adventure Rentals in Almont. Both dash through the gorgeous Gunnison National Forest.

Just like its 4×4 trails Ouray and Silverton’s snowmobiling trails are world class. About forty-five minutes apart on Highway 550 either of these two towns make a great base for winter recreation. Ouray’s San Juan Scenic features its Snow Adventures which include both snowmobiling and snowcat skiing. Silverton boasts a number of outfitters including Ice Pirates and San Juan Backcountry.

The oldest working ranch in Aspen features three special tours. T-Lazy-7 Snowmobiles features the Klondike Cabin Maroon Bells and Independence Pass guided snowmobile excursions.

4. Ice Climbing

Does climbing a frozen waterfall appeal to you? Then you probably heard that Ouray is home to one of the world’s favorite ice parks Ouray Ice Park. This free manmade attraction offers more than 200 ice and mixed climbs. Come to participate or watch others scale the icy walls positioned in a natural gorge. Held in early January the Ouray Ice Fest draws in the best international ice climbers to compete.

Seasoned expert ice climbers can try their crampons and axes at the Black Canyon near Montrose. Popular routes include Gandalf’s Beard Shadowfax Train Route and Curecanti Monster. Most are rated between WI3 and WI 5 with WI6 being the most difficult on the Water Ice scale.

With its magnificent waterfalls Telluride makes a popular ice climbing destination. There are a few frozen waterfalls that people like to climb including Bridal Veil Falls Bear Creek Falls and Cornet Creek Falls. A couple of guides in town Mountain Trip and San Juan Outdoor Adventures provide ice climbing services for all levels.

An off-the-beaten path destination for ice climbing is the Lake City Ice Park. It offers routes for all levels of climbers in a secluded charming mountain village. They celebrate their Ice Climbing Festival in early February which is a fun weekend to explore Lake City’s winter landscapes.

5. Ice Skating

Locations abound in Gunnison County from hockey rinks to outdoor skating ponds. Crested Butte features the large Big Mine Ice Arena which is an outdoor covered ice rink. You can drop south to Gunnison and skate at the outdoor Jorgensen Ice Rink. There’s both an indoor and outdoor ice rink as well as a small frozen over pond that’s used for ice skating.

And if you’re in Lake City take a break from backcountry skiing ice climbing and snowmobiling for some leisurely ice skating in the Town Park between December and March. It’s located at Bluff and 3rd streets and maintained by the Town of Lake City. There’s also Zamboni-groomed ice skating by the boat dock on Lake San Cristobal one of Colorado’s biggest natural lakes.

Telluride showcases three outdoor ice rinks spread around town. For a charming early evening skate definitely try the Mountain Village Ice Rink. It’s open daily from 12 to 8pm through February and even boasts a free hour skate starting at noon. Boasting a longer season to April the big venue in town is Hanley Ice Rink. It has a full NHL-sized ice rink easily accessible in downtown at Telluride Town Park. Plus an outdoor pond that’s open to mid February.

Ouray also boasts seasonal ice skating at the Rotary Park Ice Rink. It’s open December through February weather permitting. Head south on 550 to Silverton to access its Kendall Mountain Ice Rink which also provides outdoor winter ice skating.

6. Hot Springs

Hot springs aren’t just summer destinations. In fact there’s not much better than relaxing in a hot mineral pool with snow falling in the high country. Especially after a long day of adventuring. And what better place to do it than in Switzerland…of America. Ouray County boasts a number of hot springs with the locals’ favorite being Orvis Hot Springs in Ridgway. It’s clothing optional so keep that in mind.

Fifteen minutes south of Ridgway the town of Ouray is the real mecca of springs showcasing its signature resort the Ouray Hot Springs Pool. This outdoor swimming pool is supplied by seven different springs. There’s also some hot soaking pools. Wind down after a day of winter sports while enjoying the San Juan Mountains scenery. There are also a few hot springs hotels in town including: Twin Peaks Lodge Wiesbaden Spa and Box Canyon Lodge.

For more mineral hot springs visit the Glenwood Hot Springs in Garfield County to enjoy their world-renowned historic landmark. The Ute Native Americans called these springs Big Medicine. It’s got a full swimming pool and separate hot springs pool for soaking. The new kid in town though is Iron Mountain Hot Springs which is more adult-focused (think less kids running) overlooking the Colorado River.

Last but certainly not least is the private Dunton Hot Springs. If you’re fortunate enough to have the kind of expendable cash to stay any place you’d like then put this one on your bucket list. This rustic but luxurious resort sits in the former town of Dunton and was used in the filming of Quentin Tarantino’s The Hateful Eight. Rent a cabin with your own personal hot springs pool.

Snow Tubing & Alpine Coaster

The closest resort to Grand Junction offering snow tubing is probably Aspen which is a two drive. The Snowmass Tubing Hill provides multiple lanes of snow tubing fun all winter long. There’s also a Breathtaker Alpine Coaster at Snowmass to double the adrenaline dose. It’s open daily from late December to early April.

Colorado’s last great ski town Crested Butte also has a tubing hill on mountain. The Crested Butte Adventure Park features snow tubing bungee trampoline rock climbing wall and miniature golf. It brings a lot of fun activities to CB’s base area.

7. Winter Activities Out of the Ordinary

Snow Biking – In places like Crested Butte Colorado’s bicycle capital you’ll see people biking all year round. There’s two kinds to try. Fat biking are the bikes with the big a$$ tires that grip and shred thru the snow better. They aren’t meant for deep powder just getting around on groomed trails. You can rent fat bikes at Powderhorn. Another is snow biking which is down the mountain like snowboarding or skiing. You’ll see this strange form of transportation at several ski resorts out west.

Sleigh Rides – Sleigh rides are available both day and night all winter long. Towns like Telluride Crested Butte and Aspen all host sleigh rides some even paired with a romantic western dinner. For those looking for a nice date idea that’s low impact see the sparkling landscapes via horse drawn wagon.

Dog Sledding – Embark on a dog sledding journey in wondrous Western Colorado. Telluride Aspen and Gunnison all have dog sled tours that you’ll cherish for years to come. It’s one of the most unique winter activities so take advantage when you can.

Ice Fishing – If ice fishing is something you’d like to try you’ll need a valid fishing license and equipment (which can be rented). Ice fishermen can try their skill and luck in the Blue Mesa reservoir which is west of Gunnison. Nearby to Rifle Harvey Gap State Park offers some good ice fishing options as well. Another alternative for ice fishing on the Western Slope is Lake San Cristobel in Lake City.

Sledding – Go sledding with your kids on Firecracker Hill in Telluride Town Park. It’s free to use and open all season. Rentals are available at the local Nordic Center. Ouray also hosts a free sledding opportunity at Vinegar Hill. Both aforementioned hills require a short hike to reach the top no chair lift here!

Yurts – Enjoy the Magic Meadows Yurt Dinners in Crested Butte. It offers delicious dining in the beautiful backcountry. Or delight in an overnight stay at the Hinsdale Haute Route a backcountry hut system. It’s splendid for some rest and relaxation on a cross country winter adventure. There are two yurts open for reservation year round.

Thanks for checking out our list of winter activities in Western Colorado! Consider making Grand Junction or any one of the Western Slope’s lovely secluded towns your holiday vacation base.

Bradley W. Parks / OPB

Some students returning to in-person school this year hadn’t been in a physical classroom since March 2020. They were returning to new schools with new teachers and classmates all while dealing with the trauma of living through a pandemic.

Schools had to deal with a multitude of problems — from students struggling with mental health to academic gaps and behavior problems. In Portland Public Schools Oregon’s largest school district officials report increased fights and Title IX reports among staffing shortages and other problems exacerbated by the pandemic.

At the same time PPS has been increasing its emphasis on restorative justice through a plan implemented during the 2019-20 school year — the same year that was upended halfway through by the coronavirus pandemic. Restorative justice practices are used to deal with discipline and conflicts with a focus on building relationships and community as a way to repair harm as an alternative to punishment. In PPS the restorative justice team responds to race-based incidents “as needed.”

PPS officials are seeing an increase this year in requests for the district’s restorative justice services — as schools reach out for help responding to school conflicts through training prevention efforts or responsive practices to help build community.

“Last year…we may have had 40 requests for services for the whole school year” said Char Hutson the program manager for restorative justice at PPS.

“This year we’re close to 50 or 60 requests just for fall term.”

Despite the increased demand for the district’s restorative justice team staffing levels and lack of buy-in from administrators have created a patchwork of restorative justice across the district. Some schools have their own restorative justice staff members others rely on the district’s six-person team where each member is assigned to several schools.

Restorative justice response at Roseway Heights

At Northeast Portland’s Roseway Heights Middle School some students staged a walkout in November demonstrating against what they said was a lack of action from school staff and administrators to rein in a range of behavior problems from sexual harassment to racial slurs to violence. The walkout led to fights outside of the school. After that school staff received some training on restorative justice.

Daniel Jacobs teaches seventh grade social studies at Roseway Heights.

“We’re doing more introductory lessons on it and it’s been used… the biggest thing is being able to start helping build classroom community individually” Jacobs said.

“But… if we’re talking about really implementing it with fidelity it’s going to take a lot more time and a lot more resources and a lot more dedication from the district.”

After the walkout the district brought in additional staff and set aside time for more support for students. The district also mentioned prioritizing racial affinity groups and LGBTQ affinity groups for students to have safe spaces as well as a goal to increase BIPOC school staff.

But Jacobs said these and other changes come back to the need for more concrete changes at the school and district.

“Saying you’ve implemented something is only the first step it needs to be systematic it needs to be implemented with fidelity and it needs to have an actionable plan that can actually support students” Jacobs said.

Jacobs also connected these issues to current labor shortages facing PPS and districts around the state and country. When counselors and other non-classroom staff have to step in to substitute or cover for a teacher those staff are unable to provide support to students who need it.

As school administrators were dealing with the fallout from the walkout and fights Anh Le was hoping for a response to incidents that happened to another student group months before — at the same school. Le has a third grader at Rose City Park Elementary School but he’s connected to both Rose City Park and Roseway Heights through his role as co-president of Hội Phụ Huynh (HPH) the parent group connected to the district’s Vietnamese Dual-Language Immersion program. That program includes both Rose City Park and Roseway Heights.

That’s how Le learned that in September Roseway Heights students and staff in the VDLI program were called racial slurs.

“It broke my heart” Le said of hearing about what happened.

In the last two years increases in hate incidents directed at Asian-Americans prompted his group and parent groups at Rose City Park and Roseway Heights to have conversations about race and equity to make sure all students are respected.

“For our Asian kids we’re fighting another pandemic...some parents are just afraid to send their kids to school” Le said.

After the racist incident towards the VDLI students Le said parents weren’t immediately notified. During a meeting with school administrators Le said he felt administrators were trying to minimize what happened.

Le didn’t feel like administrators had the student take responsibility for their actions and he said a couple of weeks later a similar incident happened.

“Things happen but to me I see the failure of PPS from the administrative side” Le said. “You have to have a certain protocol when things happen...to protect our kids because we send our kids to school not to be abused.”

HPH requested a restorative justice process for parents and school administrators but months later he said the groups still haven’t met.

“We want them to be accountable for our kids and at the end of the day it benefits the whole community not only our kids because we are part of the community” Le said.

A message OPB sent to PPS officials late Thursday Dec. 23 wasn’t immediately returned.

Across the district there are inconsistencies when it comes to restorative justice efforts — both in who does the work and who asks for it.

81 schools 6 district staff assigned to restorative justice work

Hutson’s district-wide team of six restorative justice specialists cover all 81 schools in the district. They are assigned to cohorts of schools as part of school support teams under the district’s area senior directors.

“Because we have a lot of schools we have to create this system where it was somewhat manageable but realistically it’s not manageable” Hutson said.

Hutson said there aren’t enough specialists to go around but that the team is “strategic.”

In addition to those district specialists a few individual schools have school-based restorative justice coordinators. McDaniel High School with a student body of more than 1300 students and one school-based staffer dedicated to restorative justice is a model school Hutson said.

“There’s this value that the principal administration sees in this work” Hutson said. “Therefore they were able to manage their budget to hire an RJ coordinator for their school.”

Hutson said last year there were four other schools that had restorative justice specialists in-house.

With Roseway Heights Hutson said it was the coordinator at McDaniel High who helped out at the school after the incidents in November. But Hutson said McDaniel’s coordinator was in contact with the district specialist assigned to the school.

“We’re just waiting for the request” Hutson said. “We’re waiting to be asked to come in.”

That’s another wrinkle in PPS’ restorative justice system — school administrators have to ask for Hutson’s team’s help. That leads to a system where some schools might see more of Hutson’s team than others.

“Some schools will have more RJ support as far as the implementation work other schools won’t and it’s because although we’re managing all these schools we’re only responding as requested” Hutson said.

“So it’s not one of those things where it’s a mandated practice and there’s an actual budget and funding for a school to hire a coordinator.”

Whether an administrator “buys-in” to restorative justice might depend on how long they’ve been in the district. Hutson recalled a 2013 restorative justice training PPS administrators received through Resolutions Northwest. She said administrators who received that training or saw that training practiced in their school may be more likely to want to implement efforts in their school.

“So that buy-in was there” she said.

But not every current PPS administrator was around then.

For Hutson to manage the number of schools in the district there are a couple of categories schools fall under — and whether the district’s restorative justice practices are proactive or reactive to a specific incident.

Some schools are focus schools where the district restorative justice team has dedicated time over one year to provide coaching and training. The team members sit in on school climate meetings and prep the school on how to deploy restorative justice practices. Some schools develop peer-to-peer restorative justice groups and train students in mediation.

“Our focus schools are our schools where we are intentional in implementing RJ” Hutson said.

“That means we are focusing on prevention.”

The district currently has 10 “focus sites” this year.

The rest of the district is considered “responsive” schools. Those are schools that are expected to request the district’s restorative justice services through a screening tool.

At the same time difficult school conditions and challenging student behaviors this fall have turned focus schools into responsive schools.

“We still have to be reactive because of what’s happening right now with COVID and with distance and hybrid learning and kids not coming to school and the trauma from all of this” Hutson said.

For Rose City Park parent Le the school could be better at both preparing for and responding to race-based incidents.

“Based on what I’ve seen in my situation they are not proactive and they’re doing a horrible job at reactive” Le said.

Hutson said the influx of requests for services this year has shown her that school officials know the team is available and that her team has been effective at helping schools overcome conflicts.

But the district’s restorative justice team is spread thin. Hutson would love to see each school have its own restorative justice coordinator with partnerships between other organizations that work with students. She envisions a system that supports all students including those who have been pushed out by exclusionary punishment steps as well as those who want to expand their knowledge of restorative justice.

“So that we’re really shifting from this punitive way of how we respond to either discipline or how we respond to our students who do get suspended or expelled and need to reenter…” Hutson said.

“For me that vision is not just helping a student be accountable it’s supporting kids when they are pushed out and it’s supporting kids who want to come back and do RJ or take it to post-secondary education and experience.”

Before the pandemic Hutson said she started working to make her case and bring her vision to life. But similar to everything COVID-19 changed things. So until restorative justice is implemented and mandated district-wide Hutson is ready for calls from school administrators.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpLmNvbS9jb2xsZWdlL2Zsb3JpZGEvZm9vdGJhbGwvZmxvcmlkYS1nYXRvcnMtcmVjZWl2ZXItamFjb2ItY29wZWxhbmQtdHJhbnNmZXJzLW1hcnlsYW5kLXRlcnJhcGluc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Florida Gators WR Jacob Copeland Officially Transfers to Maryland,"A redshirt junior this season Jacob Copeland is leaving the Florida Gators transferring to play for the Maryland Terrapins.

Florida Gators wide receiver Jacob Copeland has made a decision in where he will be carrying out the rest of his collegiate football career transferring from UF to join the Maryland Terrapins with head coach Mike Locksley. Copeland announced the commitment on social media earlier today.

Copeland a redshirt junior this season announced he would be entering the transfer portal on Dec. 9 playing in his final game with Florida in the Gasparilla Bowl against UCF yesterday in Tampa Bay (Fla).

Maryland would announce the transfer just a few minutes later making it official:

Over his four years at Florida Copeland accounted for 86 receptions for 1366 yards and nine touchdowns. He accounted for 41 receptions for 642 yards and four touchdowns as one of Florida's primary pass catchers this season.

Now Copeland will take his talents up north to Maryland after Florida underwent a coaching change this season firing Dan Mullen.

The Gators will head into next year with a lot of uncertainty at the receiver position. While a couple of players such as Trent Whittemore and Xzavier Henderson and perhaps Justin Shorter for one more season will likely return the team doesn't have very much depth behind those players.

Not many players have played significant enough snaps to be deemed dependable at least. Still new head coach Billy Napier and new wide receivers coach Keary Colbert will have their work cut out for them in order to re-vitalize the team's receiver room moving forward.

Prime Minister Silveria Jacobs has delivered a Christmas message of hope this year stating Christmas season 2021 sees Sint Maarten moving away from the uncertainty in 2021 towards the opportunities for growth and prosperity in 2022.

Jacobs says: “Let's continue to show up for each other and gift what we really can't put a price on 'our time'. I also implore everyone to continue in this same vein all year round as we genuinely continue to build a great nation.”

The prime minister welcomed those who are present and home for Christmas in Sint Maarten and says for those who were unable to be home for Christmas she prays and hopes that the spirit of a S’Maatin Christmas finds and remains with them.

In her message she also spoke to those students who are not able to make it home for this Christmas.

Jacobs says: “Whilst you continue to pursue your dreams I send you special blessings for the holidays. We recognise your commitment and sacrifice towards the pursuit of your dreams and my hope is that love surrounds you this Christmas.”

The prime minister says those who have travelled abroad for medical intervention remain in her thoughts and prayers and those who may be facing the loss of loved ones family and friends should know that they are not alone and that this too shall pass.

Jacobs says as friends and family gather this year in the spirit of Christmas also remember that COVID-19 is still a threat and they must celebrate safely."

The old-time image of an anarchist that has long been fixed in popular imagination is of a guy with wild hair and a deranged smile holding a circular bomb with a lit fuse. Alexander Berkman and Emma Goldman looked nothing like that. Photographs of them from more than a century ago show them to be quite proper and well dressed; they could have been any elegant couple decked out for a stroll along Fifth Avenue.

But Berkman and the better-known Goldman onetime lovers born in the Russian Empire were indeed anarchists believing in a society without leaders one rooted in an egalitarian spirit free of the top-down organization that has defined governance for oh only forever. Sure many anarchists were unruly: In their heyday roughly from 1880 to 1920 they went around blowing things up employing the dynamite invented by a Swedish gent Alfred Nobel whose name now graces the world’s most coveted peace prize.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvc3QtZ2F6ZXR0ZS5jb20vbmV3cy9vYml0dWFyaWVzLzIwMjQvMDUvMTEvai1hbGFuLWplcnJ5LWpvaG5zb24tb2JpdHVhcnktcGl0dHNidXJnaC9zdG9yaWVzLzIwMjQwNTEyMDA5MdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Obituary: J.

Down the stretch of that season he really showed his potential — culminating in a game-starring performance off the bench in a Play-In victory against the Miami Heat. Over the summer came an opportunity for Johnson to take the next step —starting power forward John Collins was traded and the starting power forward spot was up for grabs. In fact it was Johnson’s development in the season was a contributing reason that helped prompt the Hawks’ front office to make the Collins trade in the first place.

“Really the progression of Jalen especially defensively in the last season really gave us a lot hope this year where it’s like ‘OK can you put him into the more 4-lineups whether he’s starting or not and add in some of those elements defensively as well as his playmaking ability’” said GM Landry Fields at last season’s media day. “We’re excited for his growth this year.”

Johnson went head-to-head with Saddiq Bey for the starting role Bey initially won out but combined with two losses to start the season and strong performances from Johnson off the bench prompted Hawks head coach Quin Snyder to insert Johnson into the starting lineup. When the two were healthy it soon became a non-conversation as to who it should be that starts in the lineup: Jalen Johnson was an emerging star within the Atlanta Hawks.

In a larger role now as a starter Johnson’s improved game was unleashed. From his driving and how he attacks the rim:

To his athleticism to put pressure on the rim or finish with authority:

(Who could forget this play the opening play in Los Angeles where Johnson crushed Austin Reaves?):

His improved jumpshot:

His playmaking:

And his rebounding where he can grab the board and lead the attack or find an outlet pass:

Not to mention his impact defensively whether it was as an on-ball defender or as a rebounder:

You could spend quite a bit of time watching Jalen Johnson highlight compilations: he had an impact in almost every facet of the game. In the end Johnson averaged 16 points per game on 51% shooting 35% from three 73% from the line on 2.6 attempts 8.7 rebounds 3.6 assists and 1.2 steals in 33 minutes per game.

The team grew more and more confident about Johnson’s abilities and trusted him more and more as the season progressed.

“Whether you want to call it playmaking or facilitating I think he’s getting more and more comfortable — and our team is getting more comfortable — with him having the ball in his hands” said Snyder of Johnson after a game against the OKC Thunder. “Whether it’s transition or in situations tonight where they were coming to double-team and impact our guards. He’s capable of making plays and making plays for other people as well. You’ve seen him do that in practice settings but I think his comfort and his confidence doing those things in a game against a good team that’s something that’s unique to him with his size and athleticism.”

This confidence came on both ends of the floor.

“He’s a very versatile defender” said De’Andre Hunter of Johnson after an impressive defensive showing against the Los Angeles Lakers. “He can guard one through four even sometimes the five. He’s always in the passing lanes he’s athletic he blocks shots. Having someone like that next to you gives you confidence to be a better defender and also gives the team confidence to defend better.”

In a season which was fraught with disappointment for the Atlanta Hawks Jalen Johnson was by far the brightest most encouraging spot in the 2023-24 season. With his play Johnson solidified himself in the eyes of many as one of the players who would be worth holding onto and building around. He was the one Hawk that the team could trust on an almost nightly basis on both ends of the floor.

Johnson set multiple career-highs throughout the season his high-mark coming in two 28 point showing against the Thunder in January and the Pistons in April. Johnson also recorded his first triple-double in that same Detroit game.

I wrote at various points this season that Jalen Johnson was quickly becoming the most important (not to be confused with ‘best’ player) player for the Hawks because of his ability and his value to do so many different things the Hawks really need: rebounding defending versatility. He was described by Snyder during the season as a ‘Swiss army knife’ and it’s an accurate analogy. It was almost concerning how quickly the Hawks became so reliant on him in his first season starting and when he was absent the Hawks could never make up what they missed in Johnson through one rotation player — which speaks to Johnson’s quality and versatility.

Without Johnson the Hawks’ rebounding in particular really suffered as well as their defense and defensive options with Johnson only second to Clint Capela in defensive win shares for the Hawks. Sadly the Hawks almost had to become as used to not having Johnson as they did having him in the lineup.

Johnson played 56 games this season with two injuries in particular sidelining him for prolonged periods of time: a wrist injury in a November game against the Wizards which ruled him out for just over a month. Johnson had various problems with his ankles which also saw him miss game time but a decisive ankle injury occurred during the Hawks’ run-in a double-overtime loss to the Miami Heat on April 9th one from which Johnson did not return from as the Hawks’ season ended in the Play-In game in Chicago. Had he not missed as much time Johnson would have been a very strong contender for Most Improved Player: his improvement this season was among the biggest jumps in the NBA.

These injuries slightly marred what was a hugely impressive season from Johnson who has strengthened his position heading into contract extension discussions when the Hawks and Johnson can agree on an extension later this year as Johnson enters his fourth season.

At the end of it all during the Hawks’ exit interviews Snyder outlined in detail Johnson’s season his growth and his path going forward in his development.

“Do you want one thing? I can give you a lot on Jalen!” quipped Snyder during the Hawks’ exit interviews. “I think he had a terrific year. He was a guy that dealt with some things he couldn’t control as far as a couple of ankle injuries and when he got upended in Washington when he broke his wrist. One of the things he did last year is he really worked he worked on certain things which were areas where he really wanted to get better. I anticipate him doing that again this summer. As Jalen moves forward in his career I think he’s someone — because of his mindset — that we’ll see continue to improve.

“Last year there was focus on his skill work as handling his passing his shooting and there was also focus on his health his body and his and the health performance side. I think we saw strides with both of those even when he did sprain his ankle how he handled the treatment and how he got himself back. Obviously the biggest thing I think for him because of his feel for the game he has so many different situations where he has to read what the best option is and you’re not always going to have a clear this is the best option.

“There’s a continuum there is this is a high percentage shot this is a higher percentage shot you know there there are so many things that go into it this is a good pass this is a better pass. When you have someone that’s able to make plays like that there’s a layer of the game that unfolds that that you have to prepare yourself mentally and physically to be able to make all those decisions in a really efficient way. I think he’ll continue to get more and more efficient and play better and better defense.”

Johnson himself didn’t quite elaborate as much as Snyder but throws down a different gauntlet for himself for the summer ahead.

“Everybody thinks it was a good year I think it can be better” said Johnson during the exit interviews. “That’s my mindset heading into the summer.”

An ominous warning indeed; what heights can Jalen Johnson reach? Off the evidence of this season they could be lofty heights indeed...",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoYXJnZXJzLmNvbS92aWRlby9jb3JuZWxpdXMtam9obnNvbi1vbi1yZXVuaXRpbmctd2l0aC1oZWFkLWNvYWNoLWppbS1oYXJiYXVnaNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cornelius Johnson on Reuniting With Head Coach Jim Harbaugh,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wYWxtYmVhY2hwb3N0LmNvbS9zdG9yeS9zcG9ydHMvcGdhLzIwMjQvMDUvMDkvd2h5LWR1c3Rpbi1qb2huc29uLXNheXMtbGl2LXBsYXllcnMtc2hvdWxkLWJlLXJld2FyZGVkLWluLXBnYS10b3VyLW1lcmdlci83MzYyOTg3NTAwNy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Dustin Johnson says LIV players should be rewarded in PGA Tour merger,"Dustin Johnson has a completely different take on those who shunned the PGA Tour for LIV Golf and those who are being hailed as loyalists for remaining on the tour.

Speaking on the second second season of the Netflix series ""Full Swing"" Johnson believes those golfers who were handed tens and some hundreds of millions of dollars from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund are the ones who ""took the risk."" One reason is the criticism those golfers received from joining a league financed by a country with atrocious human rights violations.

Johnson who lives in Jupiter also wonders why those who remained on the tour — many turning down those multimillions — should be compensated if the two sides one day unite.

""No I don't"" Johnson said on the episode when asked whether PGA Tour players were owed compensation if LIV players returned to the tour.

""The guys that went to LIV we took a lot of criticism. We're the ones that took the risk for everything. So why should they be compensated? Obviously if this merger comes along there's gonna be a lot of guys who wish they would've signed.""

With no final deal since the framework agreement was announced 11 months ago one heavily discussed aspect is how PGA Tour players are rewarded and LIV golfers penalized for their decisions.

PGA Tour players are being promised very large sums of money through the enterprises' equity share plan. Large as in a reported $100 million for Tiger Woods $50 million for Rory McIlroy and $30 million for players like Justin Thomas and Jordan Spieth according to the The Telegraph.

When it comes to legacy reputation and their safety Johnson is correct. These players have made sacrifices.

Paulina Gretzky Johnson's wife revealed that the couple received death threats after her husband joined LIV.

""People sending death threats and awful awful awful things"" she said. ""People were aggressive that’s for sure. But that’s when I shut it down for a little bit. I was like I don’t need to look at this. Everyone has an opinion on it. Fine.”

But financially … Jon Rahm's sacrifice will earn him a reported $550 million including bonuses for joining LIV while Johnson Phil Mickelson Bryson DeChambeau Brooks Koepka and Cam Smith reportedly all signed with LIV for more than $100 million.

And many others will earn tens of millions such as Tyrrell Hatton who reportedly signed for around $65 million.

""The Select Committee acts absent any valid legislative power and threatens to violate longstanding principles of separation of powers by performing a law enforcement function absent authority to do so"" a complaint filed by Budowich in the Washington D.C. federal district court reads.

""Mr. Budowich has not been afforded the opportunity to review the subpoena at issue in order to ascertain the extent or scope of information and records requested; moreover the Select Committee has dispensed with all procedural rules failed to accord due process and neglected to provide formal notice"" it continues.

Budowich who started his current role as Trump's spokesman in July told Fox News Friday that he's been cooperating with the Jan. 6 committee's investigation including by sitting for a deposition on Wednesday and providing a variety of records before then.

That included Budowich said bank transactions and text messages related to his role as a consultant for a group that advertised Trump's Jan. 6 Ellipse rally. His complaint against the committee says he produced ""more than 1700 pages of documents"" and gave the committee ""roughly four hours of sworn testimony.""

Budowich also previously worked on the Trump campaign but left that job in November and he was an adviser to Donald Trump Jr.

JAN. 6 COMMITTEE SUBPOENA FOR PRIVATE PHONE RECORDS REQUESTS SWATH OF DATA FROM CALL LOGS TO IP ADDRESSES

The Jan. 6 committee first sent the subpoena to JPMorgan Chase on Nov. 23. But the bank which according to documents reviewed by Fox News is represented in the matter by former Obama Attorney General Loretta Lynch just Tuesday sent a notice to Budowich's Sacramento California home via overnight mail to be delivered Wednesday that it is complying with the subpoena.

That was the day Budowich was in Washington D.C. to testify before the Jan. 6 committee. He said he did not return to his home until Thursday. And when he did Budowich found the letter contained a Friday deadline for him to file something blocking the release of his records to the committee.

""After complying completely with the Committee including sitting for a four-hour deposition on December 22nd I returned home on December 23rd only to find a notice from my banking institution JPMorgan Chase that they’d be handing over my banking records to the committee if I did not provide a court-ordered stoppage by December 24th"" Budowich said in a statement.

The notice from JPMorgan Chase also did not include a copy of the subpoena or any details about what documents the subpoena is asking for.

""To add to the absurdity neither the committee nor JPMorgan Chase will provide me with a copy of the actual contents of the subpoena"" Budowich said.

Budowich said the bank would only show him a cover of the subpoena which did not include any details about the scope of the document.

That appears to be a departure from the practice that telecommunications companies getting subpoenas from the Jan. 6 committee are following with their notices. Fox News reported earlier this month that a notice AT&T sent to a customer being investigated by the Jan. 6 committee included a full copy of a subpoena sent to it by the committee.

By providing the subpoena to its customers AT&T enabled them to see what information the committee was seeking.

""For me this complaint being filed in federal court is not about politics or partisanship"" Budowich said. ""Government should not be a weapon that's freely used against political opponents and private citizens — but it seems like this Democrat-led Congress is intent on codifying that precedent.""

""Democracy is under attack. However not by the people who illegally entered the Capitol on January 6th 2021 but instead by a committee whose members walk freely in its halls every day"" he said.

In Budowich's complaint against the committee his attorneys argue that because House Speaker Nancy Pelosi D-Calif. only appointed nine members to the committee it is not acting in accordance with its own authorizing resolution which says the committee ""shall"" appoint 13 members. The Trump spokesman's attorneys also say the subpoena lacks ""a valid legislative purpose"" and that compelling JPMorgan Chase to produce financial records violates the First Amendment.

Budowich is also seeking a temporary restraining order to prevent the bank from giving his information to the committee.

The Jan. 6 committee did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News. JPMorgan Chase declined to comment.

Republicans argue the committee is more of a political witch hunt than a serious investigation particularly after Pelosi refused to seat picks from Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy R-Calif. on the committee.

But Democrats say the committee is necessary to ensure an attack like the one on Jan. 6 — during which a mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol and menaced lawmakers after Trump spent months falsely claiming that the presidential election was stolen — never happens again. They created the committee after Republicans blocked a bill for an independent commission on the matter.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZS1zdW4uY29tL21vbmV5LzQyODY5OTgvYXJlLWJhbmtzLW9wZW4tdG9kYXktbmV3LXllYXJzLWZvci1jaGFzZS_SAVNodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGUtc3VuLmNvbS9tb25leS80Mjg2OTk4L2FyZS1iYW5rcy1vcGVuLXRvZGF5LW5ldy15ZWFycy1mb3ItY2hhc2UvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Are banks open today?

The committee through a subpoena is seeking the financial records from J.P. Morgan Chase for potential information connected to the source of funding to an organization that helped promote a rally attended by Trump that preceded the Capitol Hill insurrection Politico reported.

But Budowich argues in the suit filed Friday in United States District Court for the District of Columbia that he’s been cooperating with the committee and that he has been denied due process after not receiving a copy of the J.P. Morgan Chase subpoena or enough time to look over it according to Fox News.

“Mr. Budowich has not been afforded the opportunity to review the subpoena at issue in order to ascertain the extent or scope of information and records requested” his lawsuit says.

“Moreover the Select Committee has dispensed with all procedural rules failed to accord due process and neglected to provide formal notice” it continues.

Budowich already handed over “more than 1700 pages of documents” and “roughly four hours of sworn testimony” to the committee.

He told Fox News on Friday that included in the records he already provided to the committee were bank transactions and text messages connected to his consulting role with the group that promoted the rally.

While being deposed Budowich answered questions on “his involvement in the planning of a peaceful lawful rally to celebrate President Trump’s accomplishments” according to the suit.

Budowich was deposed by the committee on Wednesday in Washington DC. The same day mail from JPMorgan Chase was delivered to his California home notifying him the institution would be complying with the subpoena Fox News reported.

The banking institution said “that they’d be handing over my banking records to the committee if I did not provide a court-ordered stoppage by December 24th” Budowich said in a statement to Fox News.

“To add to the absurdity neither the committee nor JPMorgan Chase will provide me with a copy of the actual contents of the subpoena” Budowich said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS9uZXdzL3RydW1wLXNwb2tlc21hbi1zdWluZy1qYW4tNi0xNDA2NDAwNjAuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Trump spokesman suing Jan. 6 panel says he is cooperating with investigation,"



A spokesman for former President Trump said he has cooperated with the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol but is seeking to block his bank records from the panel.

Taylor Budowich - who according to his Twitter profile is the director of communications for Trump and his Save America PAC - revealed in a lawsuit filed Friday that he has provided the panel with more than 1700 pages of documents and has delivered roughly four hours of sworn testimony after being subpoenaed by the committee in November.

According to the panel's subpoena Budowich ""solicited a 501(c)(4) organization to conduct a social media and radio advertising campaign to encourage people to attend the rally on the Ellipse"" on Jan. 6 which was being held in support of Trump and his claims of election fraud.

The committee said it has a reason to believe that Budowich funneled roughly $200000 from one or several undisclosed sources to finance the campaign.

Budowich on Friday filed a lawsuit against the committee its members and Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) in an effort to block JPMorgan Chase from having to hand over his banking information to the committee as requested in a subpoena his bank received.

The Trump spokesman is claiming that the panel ""lacks the lawful authority to seek and to obtain"" the bank records contending that he will ""suffer irreparable harm by having a third party involuntarily produce his private and personal financial information.""

The lawsuit points to his cooperation with the committee as a reason his bank should not have to hand over his financial records.

It says the documents he provided to the committee were ""sufficient"" to identify transactions made between Dec. 19 2020 and Jan. 31 2021 in connection to the rally at the Ellipse.

The lawsuit also says Budowich answered questions at his deposition ""concerning payments made and received regarding his involvement in the planning of a peaceful lawful rally to celebrate President Trump's accomplishments.""

""Despite Mr. Budowich's continuing cooperation with the Select Committee upon arriving home from his deposition before the Select Committee in Washington D.C. Mr. Budowich had a notice from his bank that he had until 5:00 p.m. the next day Christmas Eve to respond"" the lawsuit reads.

""The Select Committee's deceptive tactics to ambush Mr. Budowich and deprive him of a meaningful opportunity to object to the production of personal financial records demonstrates a lack of good faith by the Select Committee"" the lawsuit continues.

The Trump spokesman also took issue with the timing of the bank subpoena. The lawsuit says he received a letter dated Dec. 21 from JPMorgan Chase on Dec. 23 at 7 p.m. Eastern time that said it was going to produce documents requested in the subpoena unless Budowich provided the bank with ""documentation legally obligated it to stop taking such steps"" by Dec. 24 at 5 p.m. Eastern time.

The lawsuit says the committee ""refused to extend the deadline for when JPMorgan could produce documents and Mr. Budowich could file this lawsuit to object"" despite the banks being closed nationwide for the holiday weekend.

""Government should not be a weapon that's freely used against political opponents and private citizens--but it seems like this Democrat-led Congress is intent on codifying that precedent"" Budowich said in a statement on Friday regarding the lawsuit.

He also claimed that the committee did not provide him or JPMorgan Chase with ""a copy of the actual contents of the subpoena.""

The Hill reached out to the select committee for comment.

Budowich is the latest individual to take legal action against the select committee. Far-right radio host Alex Jones and former Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows have both filed lawsuits against the committee and Pelosi.

Trump sued the committee and the National Archives in October after President Biden waived executive privilege for Trump White House records the panel had requested for its investigation.

After losing a number of battles in lower courts Trump earlier this week filed an emergency petition with the Supreme Court requesting that the jurors block the National Archives from handing over the requested records to the committee.

Hours later the panel filed an expedition request asking that the bench respond to the former president's request by mid-January because a delay in making a decision would ""inflict a serious injury on the Select Committee and the public."""

This quirky compelling musical by David Lindsay-Abaire and Jeanine Tesori world-premiering Off-Broadway at the Atlantic Theater Company has a 62-year-old actress going on 16 named Victoria Clark.

It’s a bittersweet 16. Kimberly Levaco is a teenager suffering from Methuselah Syndrome a rare (and fatal) genetic disorder that causes her to age at more than four-and-a-half-times the normal rate. By the time she reaches full teenage bloom she’s ready to cash in her chips. “Getting older is my affliction” she sings to her high school peers. “Getting older is your cure.”

Paramount among the pleasures of this show is watching a seasoned Broadway veteran melt into a willowy innocent unassuming young girl. Clark parks her star status at the stage door and surrenders to the character she’s playing. “All of us have these different facets to our personality” the actress insists. “As actors we get to tap into those different people living inside of us and give them air time. There has always been a big kid inside of me so that is the joy—and also the difficulty—of this role actually accessing her and allowing her free rein.

“It’s rigorous on me in every way—physically emotionally vocally—but I’d say every bit of my life experience and my experience as an actor comes into play. It feels as if I’ve tapped into a deep part of myself that wants to grapple with mortality and bathe in the beauty of being alive.”

It was Tesori who recruited a reluctant Clark for Kimberly Akimbo. “Almost two years ago she called me up and told me she was working on something that might interest me” Clark recalls. “I didn’t seem right for it but she persisted and sent me some of the music. I still said ‘Oh no. This isn’t for my voice. You need a big old Broadway pop singer.’ She just said ‘Trust me.’”

A gang of three—Tesori Lindsay-Abaire and director Jessica Stone—finally convinced Clark to make the leap and the upshot is she’s gotten some of the best reviews of her career. Yes she’s glad she said yes. “These are artists who are in their prime. They asked me to look at it then come in and talk to them about it. The score really touches me and the story is so incredible.”

Getting rolling after the pandemic was rough. “We all came out of hibernation for this project. It felt very odd going back to work but Jessica had a very clear vision of what she wanted.”

Kimberly Akimbo is an odd-duck dramedy with off-center charm and poignant underpinnings. By turns it can be profoundly funny or deeply moving. “That’s David and Jeanine” Clark says spotting the instigators immediately. “They have such extremes inside of themselves. They’ve got the wit and the humor and the nonchalance—plus this work ethic that is incredibly distilled and defines them as artists. They dig and this show requires a lot of digging for the actors.”

It is not the first time Clark has encountered a musical heroine with an age discrepancy. In her 2005 Tony-winning role in Craig Lucas and Adam Guettel’s The Light in the Piazza she was a Southern mother summering in Florence with a 26-year-old daughter who because of a childhood accident has been left with the mind of a 10-year-old. She watches the daughter fall in love with a rich ardent Italian who construes her condition as innocence and proposes marriage.

Similarly Kimberly is out of place in the real world a painfully conspicuous misfit with her teen besties. She shrugs off a threat of pregnancy with “I went through menopause four years ago.”

She doesn’t even belong at home. Her special malady has driven her father (Hand to God’s Steven Boyer) to drink and her mother (Cry Baby’s Alli Mauzey) to another pregnancy hoping for better results. Thus Kimberly finds her room turned into a nursery forcing her to hit the road with her for-want-of-a-better-word “love interest” a tuba-tooting anagram-obsessed nerd named Seth (Justin Cooley). Punctuating all of the above is Kimberly’s Aunt Debra (Head Over Head’s Bonnie Milligan) an ex-con trying to organize the local youths in a money-laundering scheme. Milligan’s Aunt Debra swipes scenes right and left while she spreads comedy chaos wherever she goes.

“It is such a joy to work with these actors” Clark trills. “Sometimes when I’m really worn out I just think ‘Well I get to see Bonnie and Alli and Steve—the whole gang. They are incredible.”

As for Cooley her leading man he’s 18 a music student from Texas Christian University in his Off-Broadway debut. Also she adds “He’s very grounded and present with great instincts.”

Sarah Laux who did the costumes and J. Jared Janas who designed the wigs are chief among Clark’s accomplices in creating her contradictory image. “They really helped to define this character” she admits. “Even in my head I pictured Kim in this gray dress and sweatshirt. We started fittings very early on in the rehearsal process and Sarah said to me ‘Kim’s a badass. I think she dyes her hair. I think she has streaks of color in her hair.’ Sarah really resurrected her own badass self from her teenage years for me. I certainly wasn’t a badass. I was a good girl—dorky trying to find my look. I wore a uniform for 12 years of private school. I didn’t know what to wear to football games Friday nights or how to talk to boys. Kim looks a lot better than I did.”

One of the pleasant side effects of Kimberly Akimbo is that it allows Clark to revisit her days at dear old Hockaday an all-girls school in Dallas. She says it was a nice way to go but “there are some key players who aren’t around anymore. I wish my mom and dad could see this. My best friend from grade school came. Anybody that I have loved who has come to see it—there have been some weeping and some gnashing of teeth. People who know me know this is a journey.”

Reviews for the play have been favorable and the rumor is that it will make the big leap uptown by spring the way The Band’s Visit pole-vaulted from the Atlantic to Broadway and the Tony podium. “The cast is the last to find out things” Clark claims. “We just keep our heads down and don’t read the reviews.

“But personally I would love to share it with as many people as possible because I think any story that talks about perseverance and overcoming personal struggles to embrace life is the story we need right now. Kim is an unlikely hero. Most of our heroes’ journeys are let’s face it by men. The fact this is a woman—and a young woman at that—is very powerful I think.

“I’d like people to take away from this a sense that life is short but it’s precious. Carpe diem! Stop complaining about what you don’t have. Take advantage of every moment. Don’t hide.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Akuapem Youth from the Eastern Region and Jasikan based Buem SC from the Oti Region were all present to showcase their talents while Serial Callers Association Marathon SC from Sakumono and Kotobabi CAC all took part. Ashaiman had Wanted FC from Tsinagbe and Zenu Ahotor Fun Club with Lashibi based Group FC and Lashibi United joining the home teams Klagon All Stars and Royal Sportive for the one-day event.

The host Klagon Royal Sportive emerged victorious on the day after beating Lashibi United 4-1 on penalties. Both teams played to a goalless draw in a end to end game on Saturday evening at the Klagon school park in Tema.

Royal Sportive and Lashibi United were both unbeaten throughout the competition and showed lots of quality to book their tickets to the final. The Champions could have buried the game in the first half after missing a few scoring chances that came their way.

Lashibi United grew stronger after the break but could not match the tactical prowess of Royal Sportive who kept misfiring. The game would finally be settled through spot kicks with Royal Sportive converting five while Lashibi United scored once. Buem SC finished third and were very unfortunate to lose on penalties to the Champions in the semi-final having dominated the game from the blast of the whistle.

As part of Ahotor FM’s Corporate social responsibilities the one-day event saw Royal Sportive’s young goalkeeper Joshua Lagah crowned the best player after his heroics in the semi-final and final having saved 4 penalties while Buem SC’ Daniel Opare was also adjudged the Most Discipline Player. All the 12 teams were presented with a set of jersey and football while the top three teams received extra jerseys each with two Footballs and cash prize for the Champions.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vbml0b3IuY28udWcvdWdhbmRhL25ld3MvbmF0aW9uYWwvdHJhbnNwb3J0LWNvc3RzLXJpc2UtZnVydGhlci0zNjYyNDMy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Transport costs rise further | Monitor,"People travelling from Kampala to different parts of Uganda to celebrate the festive season will have to dig deep into their pockets.

With a few hours left to celebrate Christmas bus and taxi operators have nearly doubled transport fares for various reasons.

Passengers travelling from Kampala to Busia will now have to part with Shs50000 as opposed to Shs30000 that they used to pay before the festive season.

Most of the taxi and bus operators that the Daily Monitor talked to yesterday said they were compelled to hike the fares due to the skyrocketing fuel prices and other operational costs.

“It is hard to convince the transport operators not to increase the fares when the price for fuel keeps increasing every other day” Mr Nelson Ssekandi the manager of Namayiba Bus Park in Kampala said.

Fuel prices increased about two months ago. A litre of diesel now costs about Shs4500 while a litre of petrol costs Shs4800.

Mr Ssekandi said a bus travelling from Kampala to Mbale currently consumes fuel worth Shs1.3 million as opposed to Shs800000 that they were spending before the fuel price increment.

Some desperate travellers especially women and children kept trekking from one bus and taxi park to another in search of fair prices.

At the Link Bus Terminal in Kisenyi a number of travellers braved the scorching sunshine to queue to board relatively cheaper buses.

The transport and Logistics Officer at the Link Bus Terminal Mr Lambert Kairirizi said the company made a slight increment at the beginning of December due to high fuel prices.

“We have not increased much because we know that most people are struggling financially. These passengers have been there for us and we have also decided to appreciate their support by not hiking the fares” Mr Kairirizi said.

Operators also say the impact of Covid-19 on the income of Ugandans has limited the number of people travelling upcountry for the festivities.

Mr Michael Okello the courier manager for Teso Coach said most passengers are business people from upcounty who came to shop items to sell during this festive season.

“We have very few travellers who are going to celebrate. Most people have been living in their villages since the second lockdown. Those travelling now are mainly traders and government workers” Mr Okello said.

Mr Marvin Afeti who works in Kampala said he would celebrate Christmas from the city to save money for school fees early in January.

“I will simply send mobile money to my parents in the village. However my family will stay here (Kampala) and plan for January. We have two weeks to prepare for school” he said.

From Tomato Sauce flavoured Simba Chips to trying to bring back Chocolate Log South Africans have had some bad food heartbreaks this year.

HP Sauce was also hard to find this year.

With alcohol bans to blame Marmite was also in short supply earlier in the year.

We may be right in the throes of the festive season but some South Africans may still be mourning the discontinuation of favourite food items that did not survive 2021 or food shortages they had to endure this year.

This year saw a number of leading snacks and treats go on the production line for a final time in South Africa while some were at times hard to find.

These are some of the food items that were discontinued this year or were in short supply.

The All Gold Tomato Simba Chips

Under the SaveYourFlavour hashtag this year chip makers PepsiCo which owns the Simba and Lays brands asked customers to choose their favourite flavour between three of their iconic ones; Cheese and Onion Salt & Vinegar and Tomato Sauce. Failing to get enough votes the Tomato Sauce flavour faced the cull. But it was not without many lamenting the loss.

So Nestle's Chocolate Log and Simba's All Gold Tomato Sauce flavour are going to be discontinued?I wish I could buy every favourite to keep them on the shelves but alas all things come to an end eventually. pic.twitter.com/fNX1bewCcY — Natalie (@NatAlleyCat) August 1 2021

This is how South Africans voted for their favourite flavour

1. Cheese and Onion: 539 298 | 4499%

2. Salt and Vinegar: 195 460 | 3700%

3. Tomato Sauce: 110 623 | 1801%

When the company confirmed its discontinuation of the Tomato Sauce flavour it said South Africans have changed their taste preferences over time and are moving away from sweet salty creamy and tangy favourites. It said customers are now moving towards braai flavours such as Shisanyama Chilli Biltong and Chakalaka.

In the same crisps category stock levels of Lays and Simba chips are currently low following frost damage to some potatoes. The harsh weather conditions this year caused a potato supply disruption that has left PepsiCo which owns Lays and Simba with limited capability to deliver some flavours and packet sizes.

""We experienced disruptions in our potato supply due to frost conditions affecting crop yields. Whilst those issues are largely behind us we were left with very low inventory levels entering peak season festive demand with constrained supply as a result"" John Stevenson senior vice president for South Africa foods & beverages at PepsiCo Sub-Saharan Africa told the Business Insider South Africa this week.

Chocolote Log

South African's hearts broke a second time when an attempt to bring back Chocolate Log flopped. South Africans are so obsessed with Nestle’s Chocolate Log that they drew up a petition to bring it back over a year since it was discontinued. In October Nestle said it took note of the petition and although it did not promise it would bring back the chocolate with a creamy marshmallow on a crisp wafer it always listens to its customers.

The petition demanded that Nestlé must return ""the GOAT of chocolate"" or greatest of all time because the world needs ""[t]he creaminess of the marshmallow stuffed with caramelized wafer all coated in glazed sweet chocolate"".

The HP Sauce

HP Sauce lovers had a tough year in 2021 after the much-loved UK condiment disappeared from shelves last year. This came following the end of a distribution contract between Kraft Heinz which owns HP sauce and PepsiCo-owned Pioneer Foods which held the licence to sell the sauce in the country.

Although retailer Pick n Pay managed to bring back the sauce it had scant supply of the product.

The popular brown sauce is named after London's Houses of Parliament. Every year 28 million bottles of the sauce are consumed. With a distinct taste the sauce is tomato-based with molasses and malt vinegar derived from barley.

A shortage of Marmite

Every time South Africa experiences a Marmite shortage it becomes clear just how much they love the the yeast-derived spread. Around June this year consumers reported that they could not find Marmite on shelves. It was not the first time customers had to face such a shortage. Last year supply grew thin too following alcohol bans that disrupted the supply of brewer's yeast from AB-Inbev. The spread is made from a concentrated extract from that byproduct of making beer.",,,,,,,,,

Posted by @dblack15 the video shows a Kroger employee trying to coax the rat into a trashcan from atop a turkey before it turns around and runs away disappearing without a trace.

https://www.tiktok.com/@dblack15/video/7044722072190340358?is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v1

Commenters on the video took the opportunity to crack many jokes about the situation.

“Nah he works there just inspecting the turkey to make sure they haven’t expired” one commenter wrote. “He should get a raise.”

Others expressed pure disgust asking the poster of the video which location the video was taken at so that they can avoid it.

“If I seen that I’ll walk out expeditiously!” one commenter wrote. “And never shop at that location again.”

Others thought the move to try and hold the trashcan near it was odd.

“Y’all thought it was just gonna hop into the trash can or (something)?” one commenter wrote.

More jokes centered around references to the Disney film Ratatouille in which a rat becomes a chef by working his way into a restaurant.

“Y’all leave Remi alone he’s just [looking] for ingredient he need to shop” one commenter wrote.

Another commenter wrote that rats as well as roaches are in more places than people might expect.

“Evert place has rats and roaches!” the commenter wrote. “They come out when we go! I’m saying every facility including day cares and bread nut factories and water and soda.”

The Daily Dot has reached out to @dblack15 via TikTok DM regarding her video of the rat as well as to Kroger.

Tibot launches poultry robot T-Moov

After 4 years of marketing its first robot Tibot technologies the Rennes-based agritech start-up presents T-Moov which circulated in the building 24/7 to stimulate the birds’ natural activity. It helps relieve the farmer of this repetitive task while reducing stress among the birds and improving their health says the company. T-Moov starts with 2 buttons and does not require any technical installation and yet it adapts to the farm whether the birds are turkeys breeding hens or layers.

The $10 billion project will become the worlds most powerful space observatory to further explore the origins of the universe.

RIT researchers are among the first groups chosen to analyze data in the initial stages of the telescopes' time in space.

“The moment we found out we were one of the accepted programs was shocking"" said Jeyhan Kartaltepe associate professor and astrophysicist at RIT ""I can remember the exact moments and just receiving an email from my collaborator saying 'Oh my god. We got it.'""

A team of nearly 50 researchers partially led by scientists Rochester Institute of Technology are taking part in the momentous launch.



The launch had been delayed over the last couple of days because of communication issues and bad weather.

It will replace the Hubble Telescope which has been taking historic pictures of space for more than 30 years.



Roughly 200 employees from L3Harris Technologies in Rochester helped assemble and test the mission.

""Our job with this telescope was to assemble and place 18 individual mirrors in their proper place onto the spacecraft which we needed to do through roughly the size of the width of a pencil head"" said Conrad Wells an operation systems engineer with L3Harris ""To see the real launch actually occur was truly magnificent. To know all the thousand or 2000 people in the country part of this including a big part from Rochester New York was truly magnificent.”

The Webb telescope will help detect some of the first galaxies taking place after the Big Bang and will orbit the sun over time.

""We have to deploy the rest of the telescope over the next month. What we're going to hear about is the sunshield deployed mirrors deployed and that is when I will truly breathe a sigh of relief and know that everything was okay"" said Wells.

RIT researchers will track the progress of the telescope and issue surveys to the public.

The first pictures from the telescope will come back around June 2022.

Melon,"French fries are in short supply at some restaurants. Flavio Coelho/Getty Images

The famous cottage fries at beloved New York burger joint J.G. Melon have been hit by supply chain snags.

The restaurant's supplier has discontinued the product another casualty in ongoing supply chain issues.

Owner Jaine O'Neill said the restaurant is currently serving up a different fry shape.

The supply chain is devastating one of America's beloved food staples: French fries.

As Bloomberg first reported classic New York burger spot J.G. Melon — beloved by everyone from restaurateurs to Michael Bloomberg — took to Instagram to share the news of change hitting its menu.

""The rumors are true – due to a supply chain issue we are temporarily not serving our legendary cottage fries"" the restaurant wrote. The post has over 1700 likes and over 100 comments. The restaurant's two prior posts brought in around 400 likes each.

It's another blow for New York's foodies. Their bagels are already experiencing the squeeze of a cream cheese shortage as Insider's Bethany Biron reported. Now Big Apple residents will have to cross J.G. Melon's cottage fries off their Christmas lists for the time being.

Jaine O'Neill the owner of J.G. Melon told Insider that there's been an ""interesting response"" to the restaurant's fry shortage and that ""a lot"" of people have reached out. O'Neill told Bloomberg that the restaurant's potato supplier Lamb Weston ended up discontinuing the cottage fries.

O'Neill told Insider that they discontinued it ""for whatever reason"" but said that with the ""amazing response"" perhaps they might actually bring back the product. Lamb Weston did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment. O'Neill did say that at least three or four enterprising fry-lovers had reached out to try and find a solution.

Fries have become another example of consumers around the world making due with less as supply chain shortages still run rampant. In Japan McDonald's goers will only be able to order a size small in fries through December 30 the company said. That's because flooding in North America and disruptions from the pandemic have disrupted potato imports. About 2900 stores across Japan will feel the impact of the potato disruption according to a press release.

Similarly O'Neill said that J.G. Melon's is serving a different type of the fry in the meantime. It's a wedge she said which is roughly the shape of a fry that's been folded over into a wedge. It also has little ridges like the cottage fries. She said it's the fry that customers seem to like best.

""Thank you for your support"" O'Neill said when asked for her message to fry lovers. ""It's been an interesting experience tasting all of these different fries. I'm just noticing different qualities to fries; it's a real learning experience. Thank you to everybody and everyone stay safe.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

Peloton  Zoom Video  Penn National Gaming and Global Payments are among the stocks that have been relegated to Santa's 'naughty list' not just sitting out the rally but also posting steep losses for the year.

CNBC's ""Trading Nation"" asked two of its traders which of the most beaten-down stocks could be setting up to rebound in the new year.

Nancy Tengler CEO and chief investment officer at Laffer Tengler Investments highlighted payments company Block  the company formerly known as Square. Shares have tumbled 23% this year.

""This is a company that is in the perfect space for disruption but they seem to have faced a number of hurdles this year not just recent regulatory concerns about 'Buy Now Pay Later' but there were worries about slowdowns in payments and as fiscal 'stimmy' checks began to fade"" Tengler said on Thursday.

The tailwinds for 2022 are now piling up she says. An e-commerce partnership with TikTok and its acquisition of 'Buy Now Pay Later' company Afterpay are two reasons to be bullish according to Tengler.

Joule Financial president Quint Tatro instead is focusing on casino stock Las Vegas Sands which is down more than 35% this year.

""Las Vegas Sands has really experienced a double whammy this year. Obviously it's an entertainment name that's going to be in trouble due to Covid but it's also tied to China. So this stock has really been in the trash heap"" Tatro said during the same interview.

Chinese stocks and companies with exposure to the country have had a bumpy 2021 as Beijing cracked down on certain industries ranging from tech to private education amid the nation's uneven economic recovery. Las Vegas Sands generates nearly half of its revenue from Macao a gambling destination off the coast of mainland China.

""I do think travel and gaming will come back"" said Tatro. ""This is a stock that looks fairly cheap has been beaten up but I think will do well in the coming years.""

Sheldon Adelson

Sheila Bromberg

Sheila Bromberg turned up at the famed Abbey Road studio on a winter’s evening in 1967 because the in-demand harpist needed the cash as a single mom living in London. Her first clue that she was about to make history was a man with a Liverpool accent asking her “What you got on the dots?” Paul McCartney was asking her to play the sheet music to “She’s Leaving Home.” The gig earning Bromberg about the equivalent of $190 in today’s money made her the first woman to perform on a Beatles track. She had a stellar career otherwise recording with artists such as Frank Sinatra and the Bee Gees and she did not want to be famous only for the Beatles milestone — but she eventually grew into it. “It does feel a bit good” she said in 2011. She died in August at 92.

Helene Fortunoff

Helene Fortunoff became a powerful player in the jewelry industry long before many women had even entered the workplace. She helped turn her husband’s housewares business into a major player which at its height operated six retail stores specializing in high-end giftware including its flagship location on New York City’s Fifth Avenue. She was also a frequent donor to Jewish causes. Fortunoff died in November at 88 in Miami Beach.

Flory Jagoda

Flory Jagoda’s “Ocho Kandelikas” a Ladino Hanukkah song has become a holiday favorite widely covered by other artists. But it wasn’t written until 1983 when Jagoda was 60 years old. The Sarajevo-born singer-songwriter gained wide acclaim for her efforts to preserve Sephardic Jewish culture and Ladino music winning a prestigious National Heritage Fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts in 2002. She died in January at 97. FLORY JAGODA (credit: SMITHSONIAN CENTER FOR FOLKLIFE AND CULTURAL HERITAGE)

Norton Juster

“The Phantom Tollbooth” one of the most beloved children’s books of all time was written by a Jewish architect who fell in love with wordplay through Yiddish novels. Norton Juster said that his parents Jewish immigrants from Romania and Poland had multiple shelves of thousand-page novels and other tomes translated from Yiddish and Russian. “I just loved the language and the way the words sounded” he said. He died in March at 91.

Larry King

Television talk show legend Larry King was nearly as famous for the 50000 interviews he claimed to have conducted in his career as he was for his romantic history marrying eight times to seven women. With his trademark suspenders and oversized glasses King was a gentle presence on the air known for asking open-ended questions and letting his interviewees respond at length. He also made much of his modest Jewish upbringing in Brooklyn claiming to have done his entire bar mitzvah in Hebrew and raising money for Jewish charities into his 80s. He died in Los Angeles in January at 87.

Carl Levin

Carl Levin was Michigan’s longest-serving senator holding a seat in Congress’ upper chamber from 1978 until his retirement in 2015. He was also known as a relentless inquisitor. Hauling Goldman Sachs leaders before a committee on investigations following the carnage of the 2008 financial collapse Levin repeatedly quoted an internal email in which executives admitted they misled their clients. Levin died in July at 87.

Karen Lewis

Lewis led the Chicago Teachers Union from 2010 to 2018 during which the group exploded into public awareness as a model for a new breed of public education organizing. Her teachers and others across the country who followed in her footsteps fought tooth and nail not just for better pay but also significant policy changes. A widely-covered seven-day strike in 2012 transformed Lewis into a public figure and she briefly contemplated running for mayor of Chicago. Lewis felt herself drawn to Judaism in her 20s and became a regular at synagogue after converting. Although she feuded bitterly with Mayor Rahm Emanuel the two reportedly became friends in part bonding over their shared religion. She died in February at 67 from brain cancer.

Bernie Madoff

Bernie Madoff the fraudster whose Ponzi scheme lost billions for investors — many of them major Jewish institutions — died in April while serving a 150-year sentence in a federal prison in North Carolina. The exposure of Madoff’s scam during the 2008 financial crisis rippled across the Jewish world. Yeshiva University Hadassah and prominent Jews like Elie Wiesel and Sandy Koufax were among the thousands of investors who saw their profits wiped out overnight.

Janet Malcolm

The influential New Yorker writer Janet Malcolm hailed as one of the 20th century’s pioneers of New Journalism didn’t know she was Jewish until she was called an antisemitic slur in elementary school. Her family had changed its surname from Wiener to Winn and hid its Jewish identity. Besides a 2018 essay in which she delved into this family history Malcolm — who had married fellow writer Donald Malcolm in the 1950s — did not tackle Jewish topics and instead often delved into the world of psychoanalysis and the journalism process. Her reputation took a hit after being sued for allegedly fabricating some quotes and distorting others for a series of articles and a book on the former director of the Sigmund Freud Archives but after years of public scrutiny a court ruled in her favor in 1994. She died in June at 86.

Joan Micklin Silver

Director Joan Micklin Silver was most famous for telling two love Jewish stories of New York’s Lower East Side straddling both ends of the 20th century: Hester Street almost entirely in Yiddish was about a marriage of immigrants and Crossing Delancey made and set in the 1980s was about a Jewish courtship involving a pickle seller. Both films which her husband Ray helped produce tackled the difficulties of assimilation. Her Hollywood ambitions were curtailed in part because of the Jewishness of her content but also because of the challenges of being a female director in a sexist industry. She died in January at 85.

George Segal

George Segal’s long career stretching from the 1960s to this decade started with troubled heartthrob roles — many of them explicitly Jewish. He later transitioned into Jewish dad roles; he had played the patriarch on ABC’s The Goldbergs for eight seasons when he died. Segal heralded a generation of Jewish actors who were unabashed about their Jewishness. He told The New York Times in 1971 that neither his name nor his nose were “unwieldy” so why change them? He died in March aged 87.

Neal Sher

Neal Sher joined the Justice Department office tracking Nazi war criminals in the late 1970s and found it relied on tips from the public which were not reliable. So he set about formulating a new system: Check immigration records against Nazi records. His methodology led to the removal of 69 Nazis (so far) who lied about their pasts when they immigrated. His research got former United Nations Secretary General Kurt Waldheim permanently uninvited from the United States. Sher never stopped being an advocate — he led the AIPAC pro-Israel lobby for a few years and pressed for compensation for the beneficiaries of Jews who took out insurance policies before and during the Holocaust. He also lobbied for Purple Hearts for 13 troops killed in a terrorist attack on a Texas military base. He died in October aged 74.

Stephen Sondheim

Stephen Sondheim made his Broadway debut as the lyricist for West Side Story in 1957 and went on to redefine the American musical through a series of influential works that included Into the Woods Sweeney Todd Follies A Little Night Music and Sunday in the Park With George. Sondheim avoided traditional Broadway formulas known to immediately draw audiences instead crafting musicals about subjects that had not received treatments on mainstream stages: loneliness despair and the artistic temperament. He died in November at 91.

Jessica Walter

Jessica Walter earned a cult following for her portrayal of the manipulative Bluth family matriarch Lucille Bluth in the beloved TV comedy Arrested Development. But that role capped a long career in which she specialized in playing predatory women beginning with Bye Bye Braverman in 1968. Another beloved character in recent years was Malory Archer the mother to a dysfunctional secret agent in the animated sitcom Archer to which Walter lent her voice. Walter died in March at the age of 80.

Sylvia Weinstock

Weinstock was a grade school teacher living in Long Island until a bout with breast cancer at 50 led her into a career that would dub her the “Queen of Cakes.” She became famous for wedding cakes that were stunning handmade confabulations among them a replica of Masada with the Dead Sea at its base. She paid close attention to detail and became a much sought after baker to the stars. Her husband Ben an attorney who was handy with gadgets and who died in 2018 quit his job to build the devices that facilitated her masterpieces. She died in November aged 91.

Shirley Zussman

While Shirley Zussman may not be as well-known as Dr. Ruth Westheimer one of the world’s most famous sex therapists Zussman served as an inspiration to her fellow Jewish New Yorker. After studying with the famed Masters and Johnson sex experts Zussman and her husband ran the Human Sexuality Program at Long Island Jewish Hillside Medical Center together for a decade wrote a book about sexuality for couples worked for several clinics and advised young people about sex into her 90s. She died earlier this month at 107.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2dpYWNvbW90b2duaW5pLzIwMjEvMTIvMjQvcmloYW5uYS10aGUtd2lua2xldm9zcy10d2lucy1hbmQtbW9yZS1oZXJlLWFyZS10aGUtbW9zdC1ub3RhYmxlLW5ldy1iaWxsaW9uYWlyZXMtb2YtMjAyMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rihanna The Winklevoss Twins And More: Here Are The Most Notable New Billionaires Of 2021,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/giacomotognini/2021/12/24/rihanna-the-winklevoss-twins-and-more-here-are-the-most-notable-new-billionaires-of-2021/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2dpYWNvbW90b2duaW5pLzIwMjEvMTIvMjQvcmloYW5uYS10aGUtd2lua2xldm9zcy10d2lucy1hbmQtbW9yZS1oZXJlLWFyZS10aGUtbW9zdC1ub3RhYmxlLW5ldy1iaWxsaW9uYWlyZXMtb2YtMjAyMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,

Valued at an estimated $2.7 billion the JABMS will play a critical role in the future of Australia’s defence apparatus. Not only is the program intended to bolster situational awareness of air and missile threats via defence’s future Integrated Air and Missile Defence (IAMD) system it is also aimed at enhancing the interoperability between Australia and partner nations. The final decision on the program is expected to be announced in 2023.

The recent down selection of the two primes followed extensive stakeholder engagement via defence’s tender process which involved an assessment of the respective integrated air and missile defence offerings proposed by the contenders. The two shortlisted primes edged ahead of Boeing Defence Australia and Raytheon Australia who also nominated for the first phase of the competitive evaluation process. Minister for Defence Peter Dutton explained that the JABMS will connect the ADF’s warfighting domains thus enhancing their joint defensive capabilities.

“Through the competitive evaluation process Australian industry has demonstrated its versatility and adaptability to provide innovative proposals in the challenging field of integrated air and missile defence” Minister Dutton said.

“The Joint Air Battle Management System will connect our ships aircraft and other capabilities together in a way that multiplies their defensive power.”

Defence analysts have reiterated Minister Dutton’s optimistic outlook for the JABMS. In 2019 ASPI’s Dr Malcolm Davis described the proposed JABMS capability as a “system of systems”.

“The fifth-generation force has to be capable of operating across land sea air cyber EM and space and that is a core component of the transition to the joint force. We have to have systems of systems not just stovepipe platforms that are capable of connecting across a network and that is what is driving the AIR 6500 Integrated Battle Management program” Davis noted.

The offerings

Lockheed Martin Australia and Northrop Grumman are hotly contesting the project bid. In a statement to Defence Connect Steve Froelich AIR 6500 program executive Lockheed Martin Australia said “since 2014 LMA has been building our sovereign AIR 6500 presence by growing our Australian workforce across Canberra Adelaide Melbourne and Williamtown establishing partnerships with Australian industry and investing in leading local capabilities.

In early December Lockheed Martin Australia (LMA) and Leidos Australia signed a teaming agreement which will see the firms jointly design develop and build advanced secure technologies under the Royal Australian Air Force’s Joint Air Battle Management Systems Project (AIR6500-1).

As part of the collaboration LMA – which is one of two primes selected to participate in the final competitive phase of AIR6500 Phase 1 Project – will work alongside Leidos Australia to develop capabilities that can be integrated into an open architecture framework supporting application development for the project.

“LMA is committed to partnering with Australian industry academia and government to develop an AIR 6500 solution powered by a sovereign open architecture connected to a tactical cloud. This will enable the ADF to rapidly integrate best of breed capabilities from Australia and the US to meet emerging operational needs and defeat future threats.

“LMA’s solution will be developed in Australia by Australians creating in-country capability and jobs for Defence industry. Our solution will generate exportable advanced warfighting technology to enhance our military alliances and support Australia’s economic growth.

“Fundamental to Northrop Grumman Australia’s proposed solution for AIR 6500 Phase 1 is our unmatched expertise in developing complex multi-domain multi-mission weapons systems our team is led by Australians with local understanding of how best to partner with the Commonwealth and our investment in sovereign infrastructure that allows for the transfer of US technology to support the growth of an Australian defence industry.”

Speaking on Northrop Grumman’s bid for the AIR 6500 project Christine Zeitz general manager Asia Pacific Northrop Grumman said that the bid capitalises on the company’s deep global expertise in battle command capabilities.

“The Northrop Grumman developed Integrated Battle Command System (IBCS) is the basis for our fifth-generation Joint Air Battle Management System (JABMS) solution offering and it is game-changing technology already making a great contribution to emerging Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) capabilities for militaries around the world. The open modular systems architecture Northrop Grumman Australia is developing will be the cornerstone of Australia’s integrated air and missile defence (IAMD) capability. It gives the Commonwealth the ability to bring in different C2s to allow the integration of current and future multi-domain capabilities and determine how they are integrated.

“With support from our US Northrop Grumman team we’re working with our 22 industry partners including 12 Australian SMEs in the areas of sensors artificial intelligence and deployable capabilities to extend to the broader Australian supply chain. We’re doing this through our investment in our sovereign infrastructure Parallax Labs a distributed secure capability that supports the transfer of US technology to our Australian engineers and into our supply chain.

“We look forward to continuing to collaborate with our industry partners through the phases of AIR 6500 to bring the best of breed solution from industry to the Commonwealth to build an enduring and innovative Australian sovereign capability for the delivery sustainment and ongoing evolution of the nation’s integrated air and missile defence (IAMD) capability.”

Already both contenders have begun to showcase their uniquely Australian supply chains for the project and draw from their international pedigree in building a unique robust and innovative defence system. 2023 will shape up to be an exciting year!

Encontré las cartas desesperadas que nos enviamos con mi novio: cómo se hablaba de amor 40 años atrás.,"Los primeros meses de la pandemia los aproveché para cambiar cosas de lugar en la casa y tirar lo que ya no sirve. En uno de esos arranques de orden y limpieza encontré una caja con papeles de otros tiempos. Entre ellos había un paquete de cartas atado con un hilo. Recordé inmediatamente de qué se trataba: era la correspondencia que había mantenido entre 1981 y 1982 con mi novio de ese entonces. Alberto estaba haciendo la conscripción en la Marina en la Base Aeronaval de Punta Indio. Yo vivía en la casa de mis padres en José Mármol. Los sobres tenían remitentes que remitían a otra época nada menos que a mi adolescencia. Las 39 cartas entre las mías y las de él estaban rigurosamente ordenadas por fecha. Tomé la primera y con una mezcla de curiosidad y emoción contenida comencé a leer.

Mi amor: Te super extraño. Aunque sea una gansada me siento –en este momento– unido a vos porque yo ahora estoy escribiendo la carta y vos ahora la estás leyendo.

Acá la paso como pensaba que la iba a pasar. Sutileza.

Fotos carnet. La autora Cecilia Blanco y su novio Alberto en la época en que se enviaban sus alegrías y desazones por cartas que perduraron.

En realidad todo lo escrito que sale de acá tiene que ser sutil porque a lo mejor antes que vos la carta la lee alguien. No sé tu hermana o tu sobrinito.

No tenía hermana tampoco sobrinito. Era evidente que ya sabíamos que la correspondencia se podía violar en uno de los tantos atropellos de los militares hacia los conscriptos. El Servicio Militar Obligatorio funcionaba como una maquinaria para destruir voluntades y para colmo en el contexto de una dictadura que todavía no mostraba fisuras. Sin embargo para Alberto con la rebeldía propia de la edad y de su personalidad siempre había un pequeño lugar por dónde escapar. En otra de sus cartas me cuenta:

Acá la vida que se lleva es de robots de personas que en vez de cerebros deben llevar puesto un número de matrícula; tenés que ser un autómata. Y te decía que hay algo casi increíble en mí –bah no es tan increíble conociéndome y sin sobreestimarme– y es que a pesar de todo estoy –sigo– cultivando la bohemia.

¡La bohemia! A la distancia no pude menos que reírme y darle la razón. Porque a pesar de que él estaba en la colimba seguíamos charlando por carta como si estuviésemos en un bar en Adrogué. Comentando libros películas música o las notas de la revista Humor.

Facsímil. Uno de los textos de Alberto que Cecilia Blanco aún conserva.

Dolina decía que las parejas en su correspondencia trataban de camuflar evitar o disimular ciertas cosas y frases. Remitiendo algún “te amo” a la PD o a los “mi amor” entremezclados entre palabras para que no se noten tanto. Obviamente se refería a ciertas parejas de entre ciertos grupos de gente al cual suele hacer referencia. Y lo que notaba es que nosotros jamás tuvimos ni vergüenza ni pudor ni nada por el estilo en decirnos las cosas que sentíamos ni cara a cara ni papel a ojos.

Era verdad. Nuestras cartas destilaban besos y palabras dulces. Y no solamente eso. Atravesaba las páginas un deseo salvaje y a flor de piel. El de Alberto casi desesperado:

Ganas de vos de tus labios en mi boca de tu aliento en mi cara de mis dedos en tu piel de los tuyos en la mía. Deseos de sentir el calor que juntos irradian nuestros cuerpos. Deseos de piernas entrelazadas.

El mío sutil describiéndome antes de ir a dormir: Me hubiese gustado que me veas me hubieses dicho que era hermosa me hubieses acariciado los pechos pero no para hacer el amor sino tan solo porque me encontrabas hermosa casi perfecta… Sin embargo en una sociedad que sabía de represiones era un deseo que ambos manteníamos oculto. Y vuelve a aflorar la rebeldía de Alberto cuando dice:

A veces me agarra ganas de contarle a todo el mundo o por lo menos a algunas personas que hacemos el amor que es hermoso que te amo profundamente que no te quiero “solo para eso” sino que en todo caso te quiero “también para eso”. ¿No creés que sería lindo poder decir totalmente sin tapujos esas y un montón de cosas más? No tiene mucho que ver pero recordé el tema Imagine y no precisamente la melodía que tiene. Vos fijate las cosas que escribía un tipo que fundamentalmente y ante todo era un hombre inteligente.

Lennon Spinetta Bradbury Machado Prévert María Elena Walsh Oscar Wilde van surgiendo en las cartas como flores silvestres casi sin querer. Eran marcas de época como los primeros televisores a color las revistas under y las películas que veíamos con cortes gracias a la censura. También lo era el tiempo que demoraba la comunicación epistolar. Por las fechas de los matasellos deduje que una carta tardaba aproximadamente una semana en llegar a destino. Muy de vez en cuando “Entel le ganaba a Encotel” y Alberto conseguía llamar por teléfono a casa. Llamada que luego era narrada con todo detalle en la siguiente carta:

Ocurrió que desde que le di el número a la semiidiota de la telefonista hasta que me dijo que fuera a la cabina me agarraron unos nervios que no podía ser ¿sabés cómo me latía el corazón? Después cuando sonó el teléfono lo levanto y digo hola me olvidé de todo lo previsto de antemano. El escucharte a vos. Eso solo bastó para que lo que tenía preparado sea completamente olvidado. Tenés una voz hermosa. Sí flaquita linda no sabés qué bien suena en mi oído. Lo mismo que sentir tu risa. Sentir cada palabra.

La relación entre los dos se había transformado en eso en una catarata de palabras. A veces podían ser muy pocas y escritas a los apurones en una tarjeta como modestísimo regalo del primer aniversario como novios.

¿Te llegó la tarjeta? ¿Te gustó? Revolví todo Lomas para encontrarla y aunque no me convencía del todo era de lo mejorcito. Las demás tenían una “parejita” o una frase cursi o un dibujo pavo. Espero que haya llegado más o menos en fecha. ¡Ah! Y disculpá la no muy original frase que puse pero la escribí en el correo apurada porque cerraba. No es mucho pero es el único regalo que podía mandarte junto con un beso que no sé si lo viste.

Papeles besados dibujitos en los márgenes miles de postdatas que estiraban el doloroso e inevitable momento del punto final. A tantos años de estas cartas y tan desacostumbrada como estoy a leerlas (y ni qué decir a escribirlas) me sentí como en un viaje en el tiempo. Pasé toda aquella tarde de pandemia leyendo las 39 cartas en orden como si se tratara de una novela en capítulos. A veces me reía y otras paraba a secarme las lágrimas que no me dejaban seguir. Volví a recordar lo vivido con una intensidad que creo solo puede transmitir una correspondencia. Nadie escribe una carta para “el público”. Uno tiene un destinatario concreto al que le abre su corazón porque sabe que del otro lado se esperan sus palabras con ansias. Por eso es que quizás cuando un noviazgo termina las cartas se rompen o se devuelven. Raramente se guardan.

Nuestro noviazgo había empezado en el último año de la escuela secundaria y llevaba algo así como diez meses cuando Alberto entró en la colimba. No duramos mucho. La ruptura definitiva se produjo en una de las salidas de fin de semana de Alberto por ese entonces trasladado a una base en Bahía Blanca. Sin embargo y para mi sorpresa como lectora la correspondencia entre nosotros siguió —con otro tono pero con la misma intensidad— tratando de recuperar lo que ya ambos sabíamos: un cariño más allá de todo.

Voy a hablar de un tema difícil. Pero como es algo digamos superado lo hablo. Se trata de “nosotros”. Y te cuento mis sentimientos hacia vos. Fundamentalmente te considero una amiga una gran amiga. Y nosotros sabemos qué valor tiene la amistad como para otorgar ese título. Entonces puedo decir tranquilamente que te quiero como te dijera aquella tarde la de “la despedida”.

Meses después llega el desembarco en Malvinas el traslado de Alberto a la base de Río Grande y la falta de comunicación entre nosotros involuntaria. Mis cartas se pierden… o no se las dan. En mi desesperación le envío una a la casa de sus padres con una poesía de Almafuerte que en sus últimos versos dice “Todo lo incurable tiene cura /cinco segundos antes de la muerte.” La guerra pasa entre nosotros sin que la nombremos pero con una terrible omnipresencia. Terminado el conflicto cuando puede volver a escribirme Alberto reflexiona:

A mí hubo algo chiquitito ínfimo que me ayudó de una forma increíble. Como espero que te sirva te lo paso: “Nunca odies a tu enemigo sino eres en parte esclavo de él. Nunca tu odio será mejor que tu paz.”

Frank Kafka en sus famosas Cartas a Milena dice que “escribir cartas es desnudarse antes los fantasmas”. Y yo de manera inconsciente me apropié de sus palabras cuando le digo al que fue mi novio:

A esta altura de la carta me siento como si estuviese desnuda. Estaría de más agradecerte algo desearte algo mandarte algo… ¡qué sé yo! Me gustaría únicamente poder volvernos a comunicar personalmente. Que superemos ciertas fallitas mutuas y podamos seguir unidos que busquemos la forma de estarlo… y si al mundo no le gusta que se vaya a la mierda.

En julio de 1982 a Alberto le dieron la baja de la colimba. A partir de ese entonces nunca más nos escribimos cartas pero nuestra amistad continuó a lo largo de los siguientes años. De una manera profética lo que decía en mi última carta se cumplió porque encontramos la manera de seguir unidos.

La adolescencia fue una época que nos marcó a fuego como le pasa a todas las personas. Encontrarme con ella de una manera tan directa a través de unas cartas de las que ni recordaba su existencia fue como zambullirme de cabeza en el pasado. Me volví a leer que es lo mismo que verse otra vez a los dieciocho años con toda la vida por delante. Con conflictos deseos ilusiones proyectos y… ¡tan enamorada! En eso no cambié. Creo que uno no cambia en su esencia. Lo que sí cambió y cómo es el mundo en que vivimos. Pienso en los adolescentes de hoy en la manera que tienen de comunicarse de relacionarse con sus parejas. Pienso también en esta época llena de ansiedad por recibir respuestas inmediatas desbordante de estímulos y posibilidades deseosa de mostrar todo el tiempo a los demás la más mínima de las intimidades por las redes sociales. En ese contexto las cartas -esas que me mandaba con Alberto o cualquier otra- son casi piezas de arqueología. Solo basta pensar en el tiempo que llevaba escribirlas. Cómo buscábamos la manera de darle forma a las ideas y los sentimientos eligiendo las palabras. La escritura a mano la letra nerviosa o florida lo tachados los dibujitos. Había que doblar el papel prolijo para que entrara en el sobre. Luego todavía quedaba ir al correo pagar pegarle las estampillas volver a la ventanilla para que sellen el sobre y meterla en el buzón. Y después a esperar porque la respuesta podría tardar días e incluso meses. Recuerdo estar mirando por la ventana del living e ilusionarme cuando el cartero frenaba su bicicleta en la puerta de mi casa allá en José Mármol. No tengo nostalgia por cosas del pasado… pero ahora me doy cuenta de que la excepción es haber perdido ese ritual de enviar y recibir cartas.

Una aplicación que acostumbra a lanzar nuevas funciones constantemente como aquella para que los desconocidos no cotilleen la última vez que te conectaste u otras para mejorar la privacidad; pero que sigue siendo vulnerable y otras personas pueden espiar tu cuenta.

Espiar conversaciones de WhatsApp es completamente ilegal pero eso no quita que haya personas que sigan realizando esta práctica. Si sospechas de que alguien más puede estar vigilando tu cuenta siempre puedes llevar a cabo unos trucos para salir de dudas. Incluso también hay ciertas acciones que puedes hacer para evitar esa situación.

A diferencia de otros atajos para completar estos trucos poco conocidos no es necesario descargarse ninguna aplicación de terceros ya que se usa tan sólo unas funciones nativas de la app propiedad de Meta antiguamente conocida como Facebook. Por lo tanto son totalmente seguros de realizar.

¿Cómo funcionan?

Existen una serie de pasos y señales para averiguar si te han hackeado o si están espiando tu WhatsApp como las sesiones activas o si te llegan mensajes y siempre te aparecen como leídos sin que tú lo hayas hecho antes. El primer tuco para salir de dudas es comprobar qué sesiones hay abiertas con tu cuenta.

Cerrar sesiones vinculadas en WhatsApp. Manuel Fernández Omicrono

Para averiguarlo hay que abrir WhatsApp tocar en los tres puntos de la esquina superior derecha en Android o en el apartado de 'Configuración' en iPhone y acudir a la sección 'Dispositivos vinculados'. Al pulsar sobre ella verás la lista de todas las sesiones activas y cuándo se han conectado. Si no reconoces alguna debes pulsarla y eliminarla.

WhatsApp Web es otra forma que se suele utilizar para espiar una cuenta y más si se comparte el ordenador con otra persona ya que si dejas la sesión sin cerrar es bastante sencillo que acceda a tus conversaciones. Otro método es que vinculen tu cuenta a un PC ajeno aunque para ello necesitarían tener físicamente tu móvil. Una sesiones que también te saldrían en el apartado de 'Dispositivos vinculados'.

Crear una lista de difusión es otro truco para saber si alguien te espía ya que te permite averiguar si un desconocido tiene tu número sin que lo sepas. Cualquier persona puede tener acceso a tu WhatsApp por medio de algún software espía que puede entrar en tu smartphone de diferentes formas aunque la más común suele ser la descarga de una app fraudulenta. Por otro lado también existe la técnica de 'SIM swapping' es decir los hackers hacen un duplicado de la tarjeta SIM de la víctima.

Cómo evitar que te espíen

Existen algunas señales que te pueden indicar si están espiando tu cuenta de WhatsApp como que la batería de tu teléfono se agote más rápido de lo normal. Si tu móvil emite las alertas sonoras de las notificaciones y no recibes ningún mensaje también es un mal síntoma.

Activar la verificación en dos pasos en WhatsApp. Nacho Castañón Omicrono

Por otro lado si la pantalla del teléfono se calienta en exceso incluso cuando no lo estás usando también puede ser una señal de que te están espiando.

US Congress on Wednesday announced a bipartisan investigation into Travis Scott’s Astroworld tragedy

The House Oversight Committee of the United States Congress on Wednesday announced a bipartisan investigation into the tragedy at Travis Scott’s Astroworld Festival that left 10 dead.

According to Deadline the committee will look into the role of Live Nation Entertainment in the leadup to the deadly crowd surge.

A letter addressed to the CEO of Live Nation Michael Rapino by the committee read “Recent reports raise serious concerns about whether your company took adequate steps to ensure the safety of the 50000 concertgoers who attended Astroworld Festival.”



They will be investigating the ""security planning for the event and the steps Live Nation took after being made aware that law enforcement had declared the event a 'mass casualty event.'""

The committee also highlighted other instances of security lapses at Live Nation events.

“The tragedy at Astroworld follows a long line of other safety violations involving Live Nation… It has been fined or sued numerous times over safety issues at previous events including other incidents involving surging fans or stampedes.”

Webb's primary imager will help it see some of the oldest light in the universe.

KOUROU French Guiana Dec. 25 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- With the liftoff of NASA's James Webb Space Telescope from French Guiana today humankind is one step closer to seeing the universe in a whole new light with help from a camera built by Lockheed Martin [NYSE: LMT]. The instrument will be key in giving the telescope its first glimpse of celestial light.

The Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam) is Webb's primary imager and one of the most sensitive infrared cameras ever built. As the telescope sets itself up in space NIRCam will help align Webb's intricate array of mirrors. It will then take science images throughout the entire mission.

""NIRCam's journey is over two decades in the making and seeing it lift off into space on Webb was the culmination of many years of hard work with Marcia Rieke and our University of Arizona partners"" said Alison Nordt Lockheed Martin's space science and instrumentation director who led development of NIRCam. ""Webb will rewrite the science books of how we understand our universe and to have Lockheed Martin-built technology help advance the future of space imaging is an honor.""

The Lockheed Martin and University of Arizona team designed built and tested NIRCam out of the company's Advanced Technology Center in Palo Alto California.

How to Look at the Universe's Oldest Light

Webb is designed to peer at the universe's oldest light which scientists believe occurred around 13.5 billion years ago. As the universe expands those light waves that were once visible have now shifted into the infrared spectrum.

This light is incredibly far away and extremely dim which is why Webb requires large mirrors – along with NIRCam's ultra-precise optics – to see it.

Before that can happen NIRCam's first job is to sense incoming infrared light and take images that will help the telescope's systems properly align its 18 primary mirror segments. This is critical to ensuring Webb provides crystal clear images once it enters science mode.

The Technology Behind NIRCam

For Webb's mirror alignment in early 2022 NIRCam senses what's called a ""wavefront"" or an ideally perfect sphere of light particles emitted from any luminescent object. When those particles encounter another object – in this case the telescope's optics – they become distorted.

NIRCam measures those distortions with nanometric accuracy and that data is then used to advise how Webb's mirrors must adjust. This iterative process is done until the telescope's mirrors are properly aligned.

With Webb traveling more than 1 million miles from Earth into space NIRCam must function with extreme precision and stability in temperatures as cold as -400°F. In fact the telescope needs frigid temperatures to ensure infrared radiating off the observatory doesn't overwhelm the images.

To enable operations in such extreme conditions Lockheed Martin developed a new technique for bonding NIRCam's optical lenses to their mounts. The innovative method ensures the cold and launch vibrations don't cause shifts in alignment of NIRCam's lenses.

After more than a decade of meticulous engineering and rigorous testing the team delivered one of the most capable infrared instruments ever created and NIRCam was fully integrated onto Webb in 2014.

Now the telescope gets situated for a decade of ground-breaking observations to shape how we see space for years to come.

More About the Mission

The Webb Space Telescope is the world's newest premier space science observatory. It will solve mysteries in our solar system look beyond to distant worlds around other stars and probe the mysterious structures and origins of our universe and our place in it. Webb is an international program led by NASA with its partners – the European Space Agency and the Canadian Space Agency – and industry participation from many companies including Lockheed Martin.

The SR-72 is estimated to have a top speed of Mach 6 or 4603 mph (7.400 kph) making it roughly twice as fast as its predecessor and could theoretically evade current fighter jets with its killing pace.

This massive speed boost is hypothetically thanks to a new turbine-based combined cycle (TBCC) propulsion system. This combined with an existing dual-mode ramjet would have allowed it to travel far faster than any other plane circling the globe in a few hours.

While the alleged progress development and production timelines are still blurry Lockheed said in late 2018 that an SR-72 prototype will fly by 2025 with the aircraft possibly entering service into the 2030s.

Since this is exciting news for Lockheed Martin hypersonic technology in aircraft has been making headlines all over the globe. Most notably China’s hypersonic weapon launch in July caught intelligence services off guard including the U.S. Space Force. The Chinese hypersonic technology is more advanced than any other country even though it missed its intended target. It looks like China is in the lead but still has a long way to go to win the race.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vbmF0aW9uYWxpbnRlcmVzdC5vcmcvYmxvZy9yZWJvb3QvbmF0Zi0yMi1zd2VlcC13aW5nLWYtMjItY29uZ3Jlc3Mtd2FudGVkLWNhcnJpZXItZHV0eS0xOTg1MDfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NATF-22: The Sweep-Wing F-22 Congress Wanted For Carrier Duty,"The U.S. Air Force’s venerable F-22 Raptor is widely seen as the world’s most capable air superiority fighter but for a short time it was nearly joined by a sister platform modified specifically for the Navy in the NATF-22.

Here's What to Remember: The Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor came about as a result of the U.S. Air Force’s Advanced Tactical Fighter program that aimed to field an all-new aircraft that could not only compete with advanced Soviet jets like the Sukhoi Su-27 and Mikoyan MiG-29 but dominate them. The Su-27 and MiG-29 had both been developed with America’s F-15 Eagle and F-16 Fighting Falcon squarely in their sights and although the Soviet Union was on its last leg by the late 1980s the Air Force remained steadfast in its need for a new generation of fighter.

Ultimately the F-22 Raptor won out over its (arguably more capable) Northrop YF-23 competition thanks in no small part to Lockheed’s flair for dramatic presentations and Northrop’s troubled reputation at the time. While the YF-23 boasted better range and stealth the YF-22 and its operational F-22 successor offered a combination of solid capability and Lockheed Martin’s reputation for delivering highly capable military aircraft. While the YF-22 ultimately won the decision either aircraft would have gone on to become the world’s first stealth fighter establishing a new generation of fighters to come. Had the YF-23 won out it would have also been the defacto choice for a Navy fighter variant for consideration.

While some still contend that an F-23 could have been the superior fighter the F-22 quickly separated itself from its operational competition thanks to a combination of low observability high speed and acrobatic performance. The Raptor was not only able to reach and sustain speeds as high as Mach 2.25 it also offered the ability to “supercruise” or to maintain supersonic speeds without the use of the afterburners on its pair of Pratt & Whitney F119-PW-100 augmented turbofans. The thrust pouring out of those engines was managed by the aircraft’s Thrust Vector Control surfaces which allowed the pilot to orient the outflow of the engines independent of the direction the aircraft was pointed. In other words an F-22 pilot can point its nose (and weapons) down at you while it continues to push forward through the sky.

The F-22 proved so capable in fact that Congress pressed the Navy to consider adopting a sweep-wing version of the new fighter under the NATF (Naval Advanced Tactical Fighter) program that began in 1988. The groundbreaking fighter was also the basis of the FB-22 concept which was a Delta-wing F-22 variant meant for service as a fighter-bomber.

In return for the Navy considering the NATF as a potentially lower-cost alternative to developing their own replacement carrier-based fighter the U.S. Air Force agreed to evaluate a modified version of the carrier-based stealth bomber being developed under the Navy’s Advanced Tactical Aircraft (ATA) program as a replacement for their own aging F-111.

In theory this agreement would allow the Air Force to leverage Navy R&D for their new bomber while the Navy leveraged the Air Force’s for their new fighter. This approach to sharing development costs across branches one could argue would reach its zenith when multiple combat aircraft programs across the Navy Air Force and Marines were merged to create what would go on to become the (incredibly expensive) F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program.

In a prelude to things to come the NATF program and its associated plans for an NATF-22 were soon seen as prohibitively expensive. By 1990 some seven years before the F-22 would first take to the sky Admiral Richard Dunleavy the man responsible for outlining the Navy’s requirements for a new fighter was quoted as saying that he didn’t see any way the F-22 could be incorporated into an affordable plan for Naval aviation. As a result the NATF-22 concept was dropped in early 1991.

Had the U.S. Navy opted to pursue a carrier-capable variant of the F-22 there would have been a number of significant technical hurdles to overcome. Aircraft designed for carrier operations have to manage a very different set of take-off and landing challenges than their land-based counterparts. The fuselage needs to be more physically robust to withstand the incredible forces applied to it during catapult launches and short-distance landings supported by a tailhook at the rear of the aircraft. The NATF-22 would also have to leverage the same sort of variable-sweep wing approach found on the F-14 to grant the aircraft the ability to fly slowly enough to safely land aboard a carrier.

That variable-sweep wing design itself brought a slew of its own problems engineers would need to solve. First and foremost the Navy was already dealing with the high cost of maintaining the sweep wing apparatus on the F-14 Tomcat. A new sweep wing design likely wouldn’t alleviate all of the high operational costs associated with the Tomcat. As the Air Force has gone on to prove the Navy’s decision was probably right. Even with fixed wings the F-22 remains one of the most expensive fighter platforms to operate.

It also stands to reason that the variable-sweep wing design would compromise some degree of the aircraft’s stealth. If the connecting surfaces of the moveable wings produced a high enough return on radar to secure a weapons-grade lock on the aircraft the value of such a fighter would be fundamentally compromised. The F-22 may be fast and maneuverable but the Navy’s existing F-14 Tomcats were faster — and despite their high maintenance costs still significantly cheaper than building a new stealth fighter for the Navy’s flattops even if it was borrowing heavily from the Air Force’s program.

At the end of the day it’s easy to see why the U.S. Navy opted not to pursue the NATF-22. It was complicated expensive and may have only offered a slight improvement over the Navy’s existing carrier-based platforms (if any at all). But nonsensical as it may be in practical use the very conceptof a variable-sweep wing F-22 carrying on the legacy of the fan-favorite F-14 Tomcat aboard America’s supercarriers is just too cool not to look back on a bit wistfully.

After all with only 186 F-22 Raptors ever rolling out of Lockheed Martin’s factories this king of sky combat is destined to have a painfully short reign. One has to wonder… could a Navy variant of the F-22 have been enough to save this program from the budgetary ax?

The truth is probably not — but the pictures sure are cool to look at.

The silhouette of the supersonic jet is enveloped in blue plastic and attached tail first aboard a large trailer bed in Marana Arizona according to images taken by Aldo Boccaccio and published by The Drive.

Skunk Works' X-59 quiet supersonic testbed jet spotted on a trailer heading to Texas:https://t.co/iZdnLYguqg — Tyler Rogoway (@Aviation_Intel) December 23 2021

The X-59 QueSST is an experimental aircraft that is being developed by Lockheed Martin for the American space agency NASA. Lockheed Martin was awarded the contract to develop a quiet supersonic plane in 2016 since then the project has made significant development.

Skunk Work’s facility at the United States Air Force’s Plant 42 in Palmdale California has been working on the plane since 2018.

The current plan is to transport the X-59 to Lockheed Martin’s Texas plant which is famed for housing the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter production line for structural testing before returning it to Palmdale for the initial round of flight testing.

As EurAsian Times previously reported the disruptive noise and trembling produced by planes flying faster than the speed of sound are still major roadblocks to commercial supersonic aircraft. Although the sonic boom is only experienced briefly it is really produced indefinitely as long as the aircraft is flying at supersonic speeds.

Depending on when the supersonic plane passes through the region various people will hear the thunderous impact at different times and at different points along the flight path. As a result the United States and a number of other countries have put a ban on such flights in their air space.

The X-59 and the QueSST program’s objective is to examine the technology that could greatly decrease the sound and felt impact of sonic booms on planes traveling faster than the speed of sound as the name implies.

X-59 QueSST Design

The X-59 is an innovative design that makes extensive use of components from other Lockheed Martin aircraft in order to keep the design as basic and low-cost as possible.

“Landing gear from an Air Force F-16 fighter a cockpit canopy from a NASA T-38 trainer a propulsion system part from a U-2 spy plane and a control stick from an F-117 stealth fighter is among the repurposed parts to be used on NASA’s newest airplane” according to NASA.

The X-59’s structure according to Lockheed Martin would considerably reduce the decibel level of a sonic boom reaching the ground. The plane will take to the skies as part of a mission to gather data on silent supersonic flight and evaluate public reaction to supersonic “thumps.”

The success of this concept could pave the way for commercial supersonic flights which would substantially reduce the amount of time it takes to travel long distances.

The firm’s demonstrator model is a single-engine plane with a length of 28.7 meters and a wingspan of 9 meters. The plane has an extended nose that reduces noise levels. The X-59 is driven by F414-GE-100 turbofan engines that were specifically designed to be used on the plane.

By 2025 the plane is projected to meet International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) requirements. The pandemic however has caused delays in the project The EuraAsian Times had earlier reported.

Representatives from Skunk Works claimed earlier this year that just about 10% of the design is completely new. At the same time the company further stated that this plane was used to test new sophisticated manufacturing techniques such as the large single-piece composite skins on the wings.

One of the more remarkable aspects of the design is the pilot’s total absence of forward sight. Rather the X-59’s pilot will employ a remote vision system known as the eXternal Vision System (XVS) to “see” through feeds from an array of forward-facing high-resolution cameras.

This design enables the aircraft’s complete front end to be more tuned for sonic-boom-mitigating supersonic flying.

Development Timeline

In February 2016 NASA awarded Skunk Works a Lockheed Martin division a $247.5 million contract for a preliminary design of the X-59. The goal was to have the plane pre-designed by 2020 and delivered by 2021.

The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic however had caused the flight testing to be delayed.

Skunk Works was chosen in April 2018 to develop build and test the X-59 and in November of that year the first parts for the X-59 began to be manufactured. The study findings and concept for the quiet supersonic passenger airliner were presented in June 2019. NASA and Skunk Works concluded the critical design evaluation for the X-59 in September of that year.

Additionally the airplane was lifted away from the jig support system in late October of this year. This technology which works similarly to scaffolding ensures that all of the aircraft’s hardware is correctly installed during the production process.

According to NASA’s official timeline the X-59 will make its first flight by next year. Initial flight testing is projected to last nine months and stretch into 2023. The initial flight testing will demonstrate things like the basic airworthiness of the aircraft.

During the Community Response Study phase which will occur between 2024 and 2026 and include flights over numerous American cities the public will be asked for feedback. People on the ground will be notified of X-59 flights via push notifications and reactions will be collected.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb2JhbHNlY3VyaXR5Lm9yZy9taWxpdGFyeS93b3JsZC9ldXJvcGUvbmV4dGdlbndzLmh0bdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,France + Germany - Next Generation Weapon System NextGenWS,"France + Germany - Next Generation Weapon System NextGenWS

By the time it is finished the new jet will replace the Eurofighter and Rafale aircrafts currently used by the German and French air forces. Although demonstration flights are scheduled for 2025 the plane is not expected to go into use until 2040. The multi-billion dollar project was made possible after Germany heeded French calls to exclude Lockheed-Martin from bidding to replace its aging Tornado jets with the US manufacturer's F-35 Joint Strike Fighters. The multi-billion dollar project was made possible after Germany heeded French calls to exclude Lockheed-Martin from bidding to replace its aging Tornado jets with the US manufacturer's F-35 Joint Strike Fighters. German Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen and French Defense Minister Florence Parly announced plans to produce a new joint fighter jet on 06 February 2019. The two spoke at Gennevilliers near Paris at a facility operated by Safran Aircraft Engines which will produce the jet's new engine in collaboration with Germany's MTU Aero Engines. The Joint Concept Study (JCS) contract signing was the culmination of two years of preparatory work by Airbus Dassault Safran and MTU. The French electronics company Thales and European missile maker MBDA will also be participants.

France's Dassault Aviation and European manufacturer Airbus had already signed a contract to produce a concept study for a shared air combat system. In January 2019 Airbus Defense and Space and Dassault Aviation were awarded a 65 million ($74 million) two-year contract to develop the architecture and manufacturing structure of the new FCAS project. The money will be split 50/50 by the European partners.

The fighter jet is one component of the Next Generation Weapons System (NGWS) with the manned jet operating in conjunction with other new weapons and swarms of drones linked to it by a so-called combat cloud. The NGWS is itself part of the Future Combat Air System (FCAS) project first announced by French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel in July 2017. The project is slated to include a variety of unmanned aircraft and missiles.

By December 2015 Reuters reported that Germany planned to develop a new fighter jet to replace Tornado jets and it aimed to hold initial talks with European partners in 2016 about what features they want in such an aircraft. A draft Defence Ministry 'military aviation strategy' said it was still unclear whether the new jet would be manned or unmanned. It said it was also possible that the jet would be designed for both options and then be flown with or without a pilot depending on the type of deployment.

At the same time Germany's armed forces were looking into whether it would be possible to extend usage of the Tornado jets into the mid-2030s the paper said. The Tornado jets had been due to be phased out in the mid-2020s. France generally prefers domestic sources for its fighters. Britain is a likely partner with BAE having developed the Taranis unmanned concept demonstrator Italy and Spain might be expected to show interest. Even Sweden could conceivably become involved.

The NextGenWS could be unmanned or manned but also optionally be manned. A definition of this within the framework of further analyses and in the context of European solution. To break-free preservation of current capabilities by the Bundeswehr would be the achievement of the initial operational capability of a NextGenWS at the latest at end of life the Tornado weapon System. Following the strategic line this is to be done multinationally.

A NextGenWS is envisaged as a future complementary system to the EUROFIGHTER in the FCAS network and in some areas as a potential successor of the TORNADO. It must thus be geared to the future requirements of airborne weapon systems. A focus must be placed on possible options for using capabilities in an Alliance context. The resulting capability requirements should be defined in a complementary approach taking into account the augmentation of capabilities for the EUROFIGHTER the capabilities of the MALE UAS target solution technological developments trends and threats.

German business daily ""Handelsblatt"" reported in its 12 June 2017 edition that the military arm of plane maker Airbus had started preparations for building a new European fighter jet. Airbus Military chief Fernando Alonso said in Toulouse that the company was currently working on some components for the jet at its locations in Germany and Spain with funding coming from the respective governments ""and hopefully other players in the future.""

As the EU executive aimed to define a joint foreign and defense policy in the 28-member bloc Airbus said it would definitely make sense to drastically reduce the number of different weapons systems with a view to enhancing efficiency and ultimately saving costs. The plane maker noted that several nations including Germany and Spain required new air defense systems mid-term and a new integrated approach towards a pan-EU fighter jet combining the capabilities of drones satellites and reconnaissance planes would be useful Airbus argued.

Alonso told the ""Handelsblatt"" there was no room for two to three different defense systems in Europe adding that he hoped to convince the French governments and domestic companies such as Dassault of the need to participate in the program.

Airbus' initiative should dovetail nicely with the German Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen's call for a joint defense strategy involving FCAS the Future Combat Air System to eventually replace the Eurofighter and the Tornado in Germany as well as the F16 in Spain. Another option would be the purchase of American F35 planes which would be available right away but would drastically reduce Europe's future sovereignty in air defense capabilities.

Ahead of the September 2017 general election in Germany the unpopular issue of a new fighter jet involving huge initial costs is being played down by policymakers in Berlin. The Defense Ministry in Berlin said no immediate decisions should be expected right now citing ""comprehensive market research going on.""

The CEO of Airbus Defense urged Europe to keep its military independence and warned Germany not to procure F-35s from the US arguing it would kill the Franco-German effort to build their own fifth-generation jet. As soon as Germany becomes an F-35 nation cooperation on all combat aircraft issues with France is dead Dirk Hoke the CEO of Airbus Defense and Space at Airbus Group told Welt am Sonntag newspaper 22 April 2018. Europe needs to define its sovereignty more clearly and state that we need to remain independent in defense and space Hoke said referring to the joint Franco-German project to develop a fifth-generation fighter according to the newspaper.

France and Germany unveiled plans to develop a next-generation European fighter jet in July 2017. While little is known about the new planes layout and features it is understood the jet would replace the Rafale and Eurofighter Typhoon rival fourth-generation jets that compete on international markets. When this model flies whether 2035 or only 2045 was still open.

According to Airbus the German and Spanish air forces need over 100 new fighter jets. They would form the core of the new FCAS weapons system and ""replace the aging Tornado and F-18 fleets of the German Armed Forces or the Spanish Air Force from 2035 and complement the Eurofighter "" it says in the Airbus armaments division.

Spain also wants to embark on a project launched by Germany and France to develop the New Generation Weapon System (NGWS) a 21st century European aircraft fighter. In December 2018 the Spanish Defense Minister officially signaled the intention of joining the French and German partners. The Spanish Government had already allocated EUR 25 million for the next two years to develop the details of accession.

It is planned that NGWS (for the time being did not find a fancy fantasy name for it) would replace the former Typhoon (Eurofighter) and Rafale (Dassault Aviation) in 2040. At the moment there are two projects for the creation of a new European fighter: the French-German NGWS and the British Tempest. The Spanish Defense Ministry is convinced that the two programs will ultimately unite in view of the huge investments needed to develop it.

NGWS would be a ""conventional"" piloted aircraft which would perform its tasks in co-operation with jet aircraft and drone of various purpose. NGWS is integrated with a number of systems including long-range FCA (Future Combat Air System) medium-range UAV (which is being developed by Spain with a 23% share) and will also work with satellites and winged rocket launchers.

By 2025 the Spanish Air Force will be forced to replace the 20 FA-18s stationed in the Canary Islands and by 2030 an additional 65 aircraft will grow out of the active service. The idea of joining the NGWS program became public three weeks after the Spaniards announced the plan to replace the F / A-18 Hornets. Programs for switching already run under the name of Dassault and Airbus but the English Tempest program has been featured including BAE Systems Leonardo UK MBDA and Rolls-Royce companies. From the point of view of the Spanish the decisive argument will be the share of domestic industry when choosing the type of change.

By 2025 it was planned to introduce the new fighter concept and by 2030 the aircraft prototype would be completed. The launch of the fighter is expected to take place between 2040 and 2045. Belgium is expected to become a member of the Berlin Paris and Madrid consortia. Despite the fact that according to Spain the two European programs will unite in the future many experts disagree with this. In their view the United Kingdom-led project to which Sweden Italy and the Netherlands are likely to join will instead act as a rival rather than a merger.

Disney Coca-Cola American Express Bank of America Lowe's and Pfizer faced accusations that they trained employees on certain ""woke"" ideas such as putting ""marginalized"" staff above ""privileged"" staff learning to ""decolonize"" their minds"" and combating aspects of an alleged ""White supremacy culture"" such as perfectionism individualism and objectivity.

These ideas trace back to critical race theory (CRT) — a framework that involves deconstructing aspects of society to discover systemic racism beneath the surface. Current and former employees at American Express told Fox News that the change began after the police-involved killing of George Floyd in May 2020 but the ""woke"" trainings came to light in 2021.

AMERICAN EXPRESS CRT TRAINING URGED STAFF TO ADOPT A HIERARCHY PUTTING ‘MARGINALIZED’ ABOVE ‘PRIVILEGED’

In February a whistleblower at Coca-Cola claimed that the company forced employees to take a seminar teaching them to ""be less white."" The whistleblower posted photos of a seminar giving tips to ""be less white"" including ""be less arrogant be less certain be less defensive be more humble listen believe break with apathy"" and ""break with white solidarity."" The materials claimed that White people in the United States and other western nations are ""socialized to feel that they are inherently superior because they are white.""

Yet Coca-Cola told Fox Business that the slides ""are not part of the company's learning curriculum.""

Coca-Cola President Alfredo Rivera apologized for the situation in March.

""Recently we learned that content accessible through our company training platform did not align with"" being ""respectful for all"" he said.

While this material was not part of the training curriculum Rivera said ""We apologize to those who were offended by this content. We would never encourage anyone to be any less of themselves.""

In March Manhattan Institute Senior Fellow Chris Rufo revealed whistleblower documents from the Walt Disney Company's diversity and inclusion program ""Reimagine Tomorrow."" The program includes multiple training modules on ""antiracism.""

The modules tell employees that they must ""take ownership of educating [themselves] about structural anti-Black racism."" The modules claim that the U.S. has a ""long history of systemic racism and transphobia"" and that White employees must ""work through feelings of guilt shame and defensiveness to understand what is beneath them and what needs to be healed."" Another module encourages employees to reject ""equality"" focusing on ""equal treatment and access to opportunities"" and instead strive for ""equity"" focusing on ""the equality of outcome.""

PFIZER SETS RACE-BASED HIRING GOALS IN THE NAME OF FIGHTING ‘SYSTEMIC RACISM’ ‘GENDER EQUITY CHALLENGES’

Disney did not deny the training but insisted that whistleblowers took it out of context.

Ticker Security Last Change Change % DIS THE WALT DISNEY CO. 105.80 +0.02 +0.02%

""These internal documents are being deliberately distorted as reflective of company policy when in fact their purpose was to allow diversity of thought and discussion on the incredibly complex and challenging issues of race and discrimination that we as a society and companies nationwide are facing"" the company said in a statement.

In August Rufo published internal documents showing that American Express subjected its employees to a series of critical race theory training sessions that encouraged staff to rank themselves on a hierarchy of ""privilege"" and apply that hierarchy in the workplace with the more ""privileged"" employees deferring to staff from ""marginalized groups.""

In the trainings the outside consulting firm Paradigm urged Amex employees to construct their own intersectional identities mapping their ""race sexual orientation body type religion disability status age gender identity [and] citizenship"" on an official company worksheet. Employees could then determine whether they have ""privilege"" or are members of a ""marginalized group."" Whites males heterosexual people Christians able-bodied people and citizens would presumably count as ""privileged.""

The training sessions also warned White employees to avoid certain phrases such as ""I don't see color"" ""We are all human beings"" and ""Everyone can succeed in this society if they work hard enough"" as ""microaggressions.""

In a high-profile ""anti-racism"" event Amex executives invited Khalil Muhammad a great-grandson of Nation of Islam founder Elijah Muhammad to speak on ""race in corporate America."" He argued that capitalism was founded on racism and that ""racist logics and forms of domination"" have shaped Western society since at least the Industrial Revolution. He even argued that the credit card company should reduce standards for Black customers and sacrifice profits in the interest of race-based reparations.

""If American Express cares about racial justice in the world it can’t simply say the market’s going to define how we price certain customers who happen to come from low-income communities"" he said. ""If you want to do good then you’re going to have to set up products and [product] lines that don’t maximize profit.""

AMERICAN EXPRESS ENGAGES IN ‘REVERSE DISCRIMINATION’ AGAINST WHITE PEOPLE CURRENT AND FORMER EMPLOYEES SAY

In September five current and former AmEx employees — speaking on condition of anonymity — told FOX Business that the company singles out Black people for promotion in a practice that former employees described as reverse discrimination against White people. The employees did not present internal documents to demonstrate an official policy but they said they witnessed a worrisome trend that raises questions about racial discrimination in promotion. One former employee said they quit because the critical race theory trainings and the apparent promotion of employees due to skin color sent the message that White employees could not expect to even be considered for promotion.

American Express denied this accusation in a statement.

""We have a high-achieving culture and we are proud of our dedicated and highly engaged colleagues"" an American Express spokesperson told FOX Business. ""Advancement within our company is based solely on individual business and leadership performance. Any characterization of our company and culture to the contrary is just plain wrong.""

The statement also claimed that the company's ""diversity equity and inclusion programs"" focus on upholding a commitment to ""a diverse and inclusive culture where all colleagues feel welcome and heard and have equal opportunities to thrive regardless of their gender race ethnicity age religion sexual orientation and nationality."" The programs ""are not based on any specific theory nor are they directed to a specific group of employees.""

In August Rufo revealed documents showing that Bank of America Lowe's and Truist Financial Corporation sponsored a United Way critical race theory ""Racial Equity 21-Day Challenge"" claiming that America is systemically and institutionally racist encouraging participants to ""decolonize"" their minds and get ""woke at work"" and urging white people to ""cede power to people of color.""

The Racial Equity 21-Day Challenge included a document with responses to potential objections. Should participants ask about reverse discrimination the guide claims that there is no such thing. The document also claims that people of color cannot be racist: ""Racism is used to justify the position of the dominant group White people in this case and to uphold White supremacy and superiority. Everyone can be biased and engage in bigoted and belittling behavior that is intolerant of other perspectives. But racism is by definition a form of oppression exercised by the dominant racial group (Whites).""

BANK OF AMERICA LOWE'S SPONSORED CRT TRAINING URGING WHITES TO ‘CEDE POWER TO PEOPLE OF COLOR’

Bank of America spokesman Bill Haldin told FOX Business that his company does not endorse these ideas and that it does not run its own employee trainings along these lines.

""This was not our program and not our training materials"" he said. ""The United Way ran this program independent of Bank of America and it is not part of our training material.""

Lowe's and Truist Financial did not respond to FOX Business' request for comment.

The pharmaceutical company Pfizer has set goals to fill a percentage of leadership positions with Black and Hispanic candidates by the year 2025 in the name of fighting ""systemic racism."" In September FOX Business reported on an Environmental Social & Governance (ESG) Report 2020  published in March 2021 in which Pfizer set ""opportunity parity goals"" for 2025. Those goals include ""increasing our minority representation from 19% to 32% and doubling the underrepresented population of African Americans/Blacks and Hispanics/Latinos.""

The report includes a letter from Albert Bourla Pfizer's chairman and CEO in which Bourla says he is ""proud"" of having ""set concrete goals to address systemic racism and gender equity challenges by reviewing and augmenting our plans to increase diversity and opportunity parity by 2025 particularly focusing on increasing female and U.S. minority representation at leadership levels.""

""We now have quotas basically in hiring and promotions"" explained a current Pfizer employee who spoke with FOX Business on condition of anonymity. The employee said the company hosted events with Ibram X. Kendi and encouraged employees to read books written by Robin DiAngelo two prominent CRT proponents.

The Brundidge City Council attended a safety meeting for city employees before going into regular session at 1 p.m. on Tuesday.

The council worked from a short agenda that included a review of the city’s financials and recognition of Saint Paul A.M.E. Church and Cemetery by the Alabama Historical Commission.

Brundidge Mayor Isabell Boyd said the commission has announced that the church and cemetery have been approved for listing on the Alabama Register of Landmarks and Heritage.

The Alabama Register is the state’s official listing of historic architectural and archaeological landmarks.

Boyd said the Alabama Register recognizes Alabama’s historic places and encourages their continued preservation.

“Listing in the state register is an honorary designation” Boyd said. “Saint Paul is to be congratulate for this recognition and this honor.”

The council welcomed members of the staff of the Tupper Lightfoot Memorial Library and the Chris Rodgers family to the council meeting.

The city’s library was the recipient of a Lowe’s “100 Hometowns” initiative that commemorated the home improvement company’s 100th birthday. The Tupper Lightfoot Memorial Library was the recipient of one of the 2021 grants and used the funds to enclose an open walkway between the library’s two buildings.

Theresa Trawick library director told the council that as the grant recipients concluded their projects Lowe’s is giving more meaning to the season by transforming each grant recipient into a Hometown Secret Santa.

Each “Santa” received $2000 in gift cards to purchase gifts for another deserving community member.

Trawick said the library staff gave much consideration to the needs of individuals and families in the community.

“The Chris Rodgers’ home was heavily destroyed by fire in November and the family is in the process of trying to recover from the loses they suffered” Trawick said. “The library staff wanted to assist them in their recovery efforts with the grant funds from a ‘Hometown Secret Santa.’”

On behalf of his family Chris Rodgers expressed appreciation to Lowe’s for making the grants available to his family and the other 99 grant recipients who also benefitted.

“We are so blessed to have people think about us and what all we lost in the fire” Rodgers said. “We thank everybody at the library for thinking of us. Now we will be able to buy things that we need so we’ll have a better Christmas. We just thank everybody.”

""Staples"" as it was known colloquially in Los Angeles became synonymous with the Lakers' championship teams headlined by Kobe Bryant Shaquille O'Neal and Pau Gasol and coached by Phil Jackson. The Lakers won the NBA championship each of their first three seasons at Staples Center and won three additional titles while calling the building home.

At halftime of the Lakers' 138-110 loss to San Antonio the team held player introductions for former Lakers Gary Payton Byron Scott Luke Walton Metta Sandiford-Artest and Robert Horry as each trotted out to stand amid six trophies each resting on a plinth on the court.

Staples Center also hosted three NBA All-Star Games whose MVPs were O'Neal Bryant and LeBron James respectively. The 2011 All-Star Weekend featured LA Clippers forward Blake Griffin's storied dunk over a car on All-Star Saturday. In addition Bryant's 81-point milestone in 2006 as well as his 60-point performance in his final NBA game in 2016 took place on the hardwood at Staples Center.

AEG Worldwide the owner of the arena that has housed the Lakers and the Los Angeles Clippers for the past 20 years sold the naming rights to office-supply giant Staples in 1997 for $116 million for a term of 20 years that began when the arena opened its doors in downtown Los Angeles in 1999.

The building will be rebranded as Crypto.com Arena on Christmas Day when the Lakers face the Brooklyn Nets (8p ESPN). The Singapore-based cryptocurrency platform purchased the rights from AEG for $700 million over 20 years according to multiple reports."

The settlement which follows an investigation from a coalition of 50 attorneys general requires the three companies to make their advertisements more transparent.

Under the terms of the agreement Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T can only advertise their plans as “unlimited” if there are no limits on how much data someone can use during a billing cycle. The ads must “clearly and conspicuously” say that restrictions on speed may apply as well as specify the amount of data customers can use before triggering the slowdown.

Additionally the attorneys general went after the allegedly misleading claims Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T made in ads promising to “pay” customers to switch carriers. All three companies must now clearly disclose the terms and conditions associated with the offer including how much a customer will be paid and when they will receive their payment. The carriers must also disclose the requirements customers must meet to receive “free” phone offers along with any hidden fees.

“AT&T Verizon and T-Mobile lied to millions of consumers making false promises of free phones and ‘unlimited’ data plans that were simply untrue” New York Attorney General Letitia James says in a statement. “Big companies are not excused from following the law and cannot trick consumers into paying for services they will never receive.”

Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T will also have to appoint a “dedicated representative” to field customer complaints. The three companies deny any wrongdoing. “These voluntary agreements reflect no finding of improper conduct and reaffirm the wireless industry’s longstanding commitment to clarity and integrity in advertising so that consumers can make informed decisions about the products and services that best suit them” Nick Ludlum the senior vice president of the CTIA the trade group representing the carriers tells The Verge.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjQvMDUvMTEvdHJ1bXAtaXJzLWNoaWNhZ28tYXVkaXQtMDAxNTc0ODDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Trump may face a $100M-plus tax bill if he loses IRS audit fight over Chicago tower according to report,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/11/trump-irs-chicago-audit-00157480 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjQvMDUvMTEvdHJ1bXAtaXJzLWNoaWNhZ28tYXVkaXQtMDAxNTc0ODDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNmZ2F0ZS5jb20vcmVhbGVzdGF0ZS9hcnRpY2xlL21hZ2ljYWwtdHJlZWhvdXNlLWxpa2UtaG9tZS1vYWtsYW5kLWhpbGxzLTE5NDUxMDQzLnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Magical' $1.8M treehouse-like home in the Oakland Hills for sale,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sfgate.com/realestate/article/magical-treehouse-like-home-oakland-hills-19451043.php on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNmZ2F0ZS5jb20vcmVhbGVzdGF0ZS9hcnRpY2xlL21hZ2ljYWwtdHJlZWhvdXNlLWxpa2UtaG9tZS1vYWtsYW5kLWhpbGxzLTE5NDUxMDQzLnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvcmFyZS1taWNoYWVsLWpvcmRhbi1jYXJkLWNvdWxkLWZldGNoLTVtLWF1Y3Rpb24ta2VuLWdvbGRpbi1yZXZlYWxzLTEwMC1iZXN0LWNvbGxlY3RpYmxlc9IBggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3hidXNpbmVzcy5jb20vbGlmZXN0eWxlL3JhcmUtbWljaGFlbC1qb3JkYW4tY2FyZC1jb3VsZC1mZXRjaC01bS1hdWN0aW9uLWtlbi1nb2xkaW4tcmV2ZWFscy0xMDAtYmVzdC1jb2xsZWN0aWJsZXMuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rare Michael Jordan card could fetch $5M at auction: Ken Goldin reveals '100 best collectibles',"Goldin Auction’s second annual Goldin 100 event displays the rarest and most valuable collectibles of the year.

The 2024 roundup does not disappoint with a variety of pop culture items and sports memorabilia including a one-of-a-kind signed Michael Jordan 2003 ultimate collection card.

The card is currently valued at $2 million but Goldin Auctions CEO and founder Ken Goldin told FOX Business in an on-camera interview that he thinks it could sell for much more than that.

AS POKEMON TURNS 25 HERE'S WHAT THE ANNIVERSARY COULD MEAN FOR YOUR CARD COLLECTION

""It probably will sell for between $3 million and $5 million"" he said. ""I think [it’s] the best-ever Michael Jordan card.""

Any offer over $2.7 million will be a record sale for a Michael Jordan card according to Goldin.

Goldin Auctions based in New Jersey is the leading marketplace for trading cards sports memorabilia and other collectibles serving millions of customers around the globe according to its website.

The CEO came up with the Goldin 100 event in 2023 to take the ""100 best collectibles in the world"" hand-selected from various categories that ""people are excited about.""

""Whether it's the best item of baseball the best item of basketball comic books video games pop culture historical — it's all gelling together in one unique event"" he said.

The 2024 auction also includes ""the most historic"" Kobe Bryant game-used jersey according to Goldin.

""[The jersey] was worn during the night he tore his Achilles"" he said. ""And with a torn Achilles he went to the free throw line and sunk two free throws before leaving the game.""

While the Bryant jersey has a current bid of $1 million Goldin predicted that it could sell for more than $3 million.

The auction also features a 1957 Mickey Mantle game-used jersey that Goldin expects to be a seven-figure item — along with a pair of Michael Jordan’s shoes that the star wore during the Aug. 1985 game when he shattered a backboard.

""The glass collapsed down and [the shoe] actually has a piece of glass in it"" Goldin said. ""It’s the only time Michael Jordan ever broke a backboard in his pro career.""

Among the items in other categories Goldin is auctioning off a highest-grade copy of the first-ever issue of Playboy Magazine featuring Marilyn Monroe on the cover and a rare copy of a Superman No. 1 DC comic book from 1939.

""We even have Harry Houdini’s belt buckle that he was wearing the night he performed his last act and died"" Goldin said.

ELVIS PRESLEY'S REVOLVER FETCHES NEARLY $200K ON THE AUCTION BLOCK

While Travis Kelce’s first career touchdown jersey made this year’s list due to heightened interest among Taylor Swift fans Goldin mentioned that items like video games and comic books have also become hot items over the last several years.

The Goldin 100 features a Nintendo Entertainment System that Goldin assumed would go for about 50 to 100 times its original 1986 value.

Goldin Auctions has also paid special attention to historical documents which have ""really increased in popularity"" Goldin noted.

LAPLACE — With insurance claims and home repairs taking precedence over family traditions this Christmas season Apostle Renita Graber knew it would take something big to reinspire joy in the hearts of those impacted by Hurricane Ida.

Victorious Life Family Worship Center was decked out in dazzling lights Monday evening during the first “Christmas to Remember” toy giveaway and festival. Organized with support from Toys for Tots and numerous community donors the free event included a large-scale toy distribution carnival-style rides Christmas music food unlimited hot cocoa and plenty of sweet treats.

“We are always a church that responds to the needs of the community. Last year we gave away 1000 toys. That was good but the need is more than giving away toys” Graber said. “Because this area had such great devastation people are focused on getting back into their homes. We wanted to stand in the gap and fill it with hope. Since families’ focus is not on Christmas and toys we want to supply it for them. In spite of the devastation we wanted to spread cheer and spread love to the people.”

In addition to local businesses and individual donors members of the church stepped up financially to make the festival a success.

Leona Stephens has been a member of Victorious Life Family Worship Center since its inception. She believes it is important for the church to step up and be a beacon of hope regardless of what situations are impacting the community.

“Before the church even got started my kids were involved in a youth group. Now they’re grown and two of them have their own businesses so we want to give back. We want to do what we were instructed to do here on Earth: give love and make sure everybody is good at this time of year” Stephens said. “People are losing their homes and losing their lives. Once we display the love of Christ then people can start doing the same thing. It’s a domino effect. It’s a great atmosphere around here every Sunday regardless of if it’s Christmastime. We do a lot of things for the community and it’s important to us to keep the community close-knit where everyone is looking out for each other.”

Church member Tawanda Thomas added that it was important to keep this event free so everyone in the community had access to Christmas cheer.

“Oftentimes at a festival parents will have to tell their children ‘You don’t need that’ because they can’t afford it. We wanted to take that burden away. At this festival you don’t need money to buy things. People are here with four or five kids. We want them to enjoy it” Thomas said.

She added that wrapping the church in Christmas lights was a symbolic reminder that Jesus asked the church to be the light of the world. Thomas was pleased to see many new faces around the church during the Christmas festival.

The 102-key Fairfield by Marriott Dehradun opened on December 2 and has seen a good amount of business. Hotel manager Shankush Mahajan told ET HospitalityWorld the first international managed property in the city (there is a Four Points by Sheraton which is a franchise hotel).With around 1000 star rooms divided between the Indian players Lemon Tree (which have three properties) and Sarovar (which have two) a Ramada as well as local players like Hotel Madhuban has a great deal of potential Mahajan told us.The strategy of the hotel is to slowly start offering unique products for the local market—they launched a brunch which was a huge success and are going to have a “bubbly Christmas day brunch” which is also a first he claimed.“We have Pano a restaurant which offers panoramic views of the Mussoorie hills and has a poolside and pool deck along with it. We have already had a few gathering there from 25th anniversary parties birthdays and even conference events” he said adding that with alfresco seating they can stretch seating to reach 120 pax.Mahajan is in the process of tying up with a coffee company with a wide range of gourmet flavours which he plans to offer in his coffee lounge.On the subject of the lucrative wedding business he told us “We have one of the largest banquet right now in the city—our grand ballroom is 4100 square-feet with a ceiling height of five meters. Our city on average has a height of between 2.5 to 3 metres. The hall opens up to a 1200 square-feet lawn and we also have a 1800 square feet pre function area.”“Uttarakhand thrives heavily on leisure with the most sought after destinations being Mussoorie and Rishikesh. For us leisure is a big chunk as is the wedding segment. Right now Mussoorie and Rishikesh are already popular for destination weddings. We would also like to market it in a similar manner but for smaller scale events. We already have queries locked in for 2022 where we will be doing weddings ranging between 200 to 250 pax” Mahajan said.When it came to the corporate sector the Dehradun market’s biggest player was ONGC and given the fact that it is a state capital a great deal of other PSU business as well. “We would like to touch base with their directors and above because of the per diem allowances that they have. Since the day of opening we have done a decent ADR and we would like to sustain that and continue it forward as well” he said.Mahajan’s other big business source in the coming months was in the film and entertainment business and he shared that they were about to close with a crew who would give them a 40 percent occupancy through Q1 of 2022 (Marriott calculates according to calendar year).Looking ahead Dehradun will get a number of new hotels coming from the Hyatt Regency which will open in 2022 to a new IHCL hotel a Radisson which was their next door neighbour as well as two more Marriott brands he added.""Traditionally this market before we came into existence from a numerical standpoint used to have an ADR of INR 3500 to INR 4500. Now that is not the number that we will operate at. Once Hyatt comes in obviously they will take it another notch up. So with these two international brands there is obviously going to be a price shift. Now when you do a price shift which is more than double” he said speaking of the Dehradun market. Though he did not mention his rates the Marriott website listed rooms starting above INR 7000 during the week.Looking ahead to 2022 Mahajan listed his priorities “We have to ensure that we deliver and send the right message out that there are professional hotels in the city right now. And obviously you will get services for which will obviously be at a certain premium to what you were getting already in the market for last couple of years.“Similarly the PSUs will also have to align their own per diems because when you are obviously having a certain category of guests staying with you you will end up delivering a certain category of service as well. These two are my main focus areas for next year”.Mahajan also added crucially that he was keeping a keen eye on news around Omicron and of course trying to anticipate what kinds of operational changes were needed once the state announced measures.“As much as we want guests to come to our hotel we will have to ensure that the wellness of guests and equally of the associates are taken care of” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFiYy5uZXQuYXUvbmV3cy8yMDIxLTEyLTI2L2phY2stdGhlLXJpcHBlci1teXRob2xvZ3kvMTAwNzI0MzA00gEoaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuYWJjLm5ldC5hdS9hcnRpY2xlLzEwMDcyNDMwNA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jack the Ripper kicked off the world's obsession with true crime.

This hotel was the last stop on our trip to Thailand. After passing a week at the Conrad on Ko Samui we moved on to the capital city of Bangkok where we hopped from hotel to hotel.

In this article:

The first stop was at the St. Regis one of the most luxurious hotels in the city and then went to the Conrad and finally to precisely this Marriott.

I was curious about this structure because it is thelatest addition to the group whose name it bears in Bangkok which opened in 2018 but due to the pandemic has not yet finished running in.

Reservation

Prices right now in Bangkok are so low that it would be a suicide to use Bonvoy points To book a stay. The hotel is a SHA+ facility and currently fills up only on weekends thanks to the staycations of locals because very few ""farangs"" are seen in the city.

This is probably one of the rare cases where the new rule for premium nights. could bring savings to bookers.

Going back to the reservation I was able to take advantage of a hotel promo that for stays of less than 4 nights offered a suite at a really reduced price. We thus booked a residential suite.

Check-in

As stated Hopping from hotel to hotel we always tried to optimize time of check-out/check-in aiming for facilities that are close to each other so that you don't have to waste too much time in commuting that in a city like Bangkok can become biblical. We arrived at the Marriott shortly after 11 a.m. hoping that our room would already be available.

As soon as we stepped into the lobby we were inundated with a very good ambient scent and most importantly we were truly amazed at the beauty of the facility.

Everything is brand new you can see that it has only touched on the mass tourism that was in this city in the world before now everything is more peaceful and quiet.

On the opposite side of the lounge is a beautiful room that houses the bar; everything is very elegant neat and fragrant.

There are also a number of awards the hotel has won in its short history including the title of Hotel of the Year in its first year 2019.

The structure

The hotel is located in the district of Bang Rak Bangkok's most dynamic area of the last decade. Here is MahaNakhon the iconic 78-story skyscraper visible from all over the city. There are many new hotels such as Pullman G and plenty of restaurants.

The structure is 32 stories high plus the two of the rooftop and has the advantage but surely it will not be so for long of being free on all four sides this allows for beautiful views of the city skyline.

The main restaurant is located on the second floor while on the 18th are the gym the spa a small kids zone (it was closed) and most importantly the beautiful infinity pool overlooking the most beautiful part of the city.

On the 31st floor is Club M or the lounge dedicated to those who book rooms with this service or elite customers in the Bonvoy loyalty program.

Going up to the top floor is the Yao restaurant and from here there is access to the rooftop of the same name.

The view from the hotel's terraces is beautiful especially at sunset. Enjoying a drink at the end of the day on this terrace is definitely one of the things to do even if you are not staying at this hotel.

The room

To call it a room is reductive but we had already realized this when we were in the hallway where there were no doors except one the door to our room 2209.

Thanks to my Gold level we received an upgrade to the largest suite in the hotel which is in fact a true three-room apartment.

The entrance is on the kitchen complete with everything: dishwasher oven induction hob refrigerator and a table where you can invite friends over for dinner without any problems.

Hidden inside a closet there was also a washer-dryer so we went ahead and washed all our dirty stuff without having to do it at home when we returned.

In the center of the room is a comfortable sofa and a 60-inch mega TV one of 3 in our room.

The main room had a king-size bed a corner sofa under the window and the ever-present TV screen.

An equally spacious walk-in closet.

One bathroom with attached bath and shower room.

On the opposite side is the second room with two queen beds full closet and of course the 60"" TV.

And a second bathroom with a shower in any other arrangement this would have already been larger than a regular bathroom while here it was the service bathroom.

All the rooms face toward the city and from the windows you can even see a slice of the pool.

Services

As mentioned the heart of the facility is divided between the 18th and 32nd floors. The gymnasium is immaculate running while admiring the city from above is definitely a good feeling especially because you are in the cool air conditioning and away from the heat and humidity that reigns in Thailand's capital.

Next to the gymnasium is the small Kids room and then the Spa which occupies a quarter of the floor area.

The most beautiful part is definitely the pool. Nice idea to create a patio for the bar so you can have lunch in the shade without baking in the sun.

The pool of course is small compared to the size of the hotel. But you don't come to these hotels to be in the water all day.

On either side are a small area for children with water 60 cm deep and on the other a jacuzzi area.

Of course the best part is the infinite pool that overlooks the city skyline from this pool you have a beautiful view of Thailand's tallest building which opened in 2016 and has the distinction of looking like a broken lego without some pieces.

The rooftop is definitely the most beautiful place in the hotel and having experienced it during a time when there were still no tourists made it even more magical; in the whole terrace we must have been less than 20 people.

The view is open to the whole city in 360 degrees you see the IconSiam the brand new shopping mall on the Chao Phraya River the one that houses the only indoor floating market in the world. But you also see numerous temples scattered around the city and of course the lights all over Bangkok

Food and beverage

We tried almost everything in this hotel except the Chinese restaurant and the M lounge.

We had lunch by the pool fast and impeccable service and tasty food. And once you realize that in Thailand saying ""not very spicy"" is tantamount to losing your taste buds just order not spicy and you will be able to eat any dish of Thai cuisine.

In the evening after messing around in the street foods we had shrimp soup and rice brought to our room.

Breakfast is served on the second floor and here the hotel not only amazed us but surpassed in quality and quantity any other establishment we visited on our trip.

The room is beautiful occupying the entire floor and having the buffet area with open kitchens in the middle. It is impossible not to find something to eat in this breakfast.

There is everything and more so many fresh ingredients available. From sushi to mini burgers eggs to more typical items such as noodles dim sum and more.

The cooks then freshly prepare from pancakes to eggs in every manner. For dessert lovers there are dozens of offerings: from simple brioche to freshly made waffles from pastries to muffii to a dozen different cereals and types of bread.

There is no shortage of fruit in this country and the supply here is also vast and of excellent quality

Last but not least there is a large bar area where in addition to hot drinks and a selection of teas there are freshly made juices and smoothies. To taste all that this breakfast offers I think it is not enough to stay a week truly a great proposition.

The birthday surprise

I checked in on my birthday and I must say that the hotel staff really outdid themselves.

The first surprise was upon arrival in the room on the main bed was a huge cake made from towels and decorations. BEAUTIFUL.

Then in the evening when we returned to our room we found waiting for us a cake real this time along with chocolate and a greeting card. What can I say only in Thailand do they make you feel better than at home.

In conclusion

The Marriott The Surawongse is the newest hotel of the group in Bangkok and it shows the comparison with the Conrad where we stayed is abysmal on everything.

But we liked this hotel in some aspects such as breakfast better than the St. Regis. Definitely I recommend it to those who want a modern hotel in an area slightly off-center from the nightlife like the Sukumvit district. It is definitely suitable for families with children precisely because it offers all the little things that can help you better experience a vacation in a city like Bangkok.

I would definitely go back.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGVsbmV3c21lLmNvbS9uZXdzL2V4cGVyaWVuY2UtdGhlLXdvbmRlci1vZi10aGUtZmVzdGl2ZS1zZWFzb24tYXQtcm95YWwtY2VudHJhbC1ob3RlbC10aGUtcGFsbdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Experience The Wonder of The Festive Season at Royal Central Hotel The Palm,"It’s the most wonderful time of the year.

The Risk and Insurance Services segment which operates through Marsh and Guy Carpenter is delivering solid results for the last few quarters. Marsh leaves no stone unturned when it comes to boosting its presence. Its MMA unit is on a buyout spree. For instance earlier this month MMA unit of Marsh acquired the market-leading independent agency InSource Insurance Group LLC in Texas.



In November the Marsh unit announced the buyout of Pelnik Insurance a leading independent agency in North Carolina. The year 2020 marked a record phase for MMA with regard to acquired revenues since its establishment in 2009. MMA completed eight transactions last year fetching combined revenues of around $235 million. Marsh is steadily contributing to growth of the Risk and Insurance Services segment.



Shares of this insurance brokerage player have gained 48.2% in a year's time outperforming its industry's growth of 26.3%.

About Binance

When Binance launched in 2017 its users could only deposit and withdraw cryptocurrencies. Fiat support was only added much later. However since the introduction of fiat trading pairs more than seventy traditional currencies are now supported including the US Dollar British Pound and the Euro.

Typically most Binance users prefer to deposit fiat into their accounts exchange them into cryptocurrencies for various purposes then exchange them back to withdraw to their bank accounts. This last process is necessary since cryptocurrencies are yet to be fully adopted in most offline places making their usage limited.

Traditional currencies have more utility outside the digital space which necessitates the exchange from crypto and consequent withdrawal. Various platforms offer varying support for fiat withdrawal and Binance is no exception.

This guide discusses three of the most common ways Binance users can withdraw funds from their accounts to other media such as bank accounts PayPal or payment cards. Additionally the guide delves into the benefits of using the available fiat transfer methods.

However perhaps the most important sections of the guide are the detailed how-to guides with step-by-step instructions from users wishing to withdraw their funds from Binance. Read on to discover ways in which to cash out your profits from Binance.

Crypto beginners’ corner:

Three ways to withdraw fiat from Binance exchange

Binance.com supports over seventy different fiat currencies but how all these can be withdrawn is grouped into different categories. The three most popular and highly recommended ways are:

Direct to bank transfers using SWIFT; Instant card withdrawals through Visa and MasterCard; Withdrawals through third-party channels such as Etana and AdvCash.

The SWIFT method is particularly popular since it mainly supports deposits and withdrawal of the US Dollar currency and is relatively cost-effective. However it can be slow typically taking about four business days to process a transfer.

If you need instant transfers you may have to look into a more expensive option: using payment cards. Visa and MasterCard are popular financial tools almost every investor has at their disposal. Binance users residing in certain countries can withdraw their funds directly into their card accounts depending on which currency they want to transfer.

The biggest advantage of using this method is that the transaction is settled immediately. Conversely this method is relatively costly compared to other available methods and is only recommended when fast transaction speeds are desired.

Finally Binance users can also deposit or withdraw fiat using third-party channels. Some of these payment avenues include using AdvCash or Etana among several others. Each channel supports a limited number of currencies and sometimes only operates within a single jurisdiction meaning their users can only use the survive to transact in their local currencies.

Costs on these services vary amongst channels but typically they are competitive. Transaction settlement times also vary from service to service. The biggest advantage is that these third-party payment companies provide localized services. For instance Binance users in Brazil can withdraw the local Brazilian Real using the CapAccount service a channel not available to most other users.

The main drawback of using third-party channels to withdraw fiat from Binance is that you should not expect similar services. Different companies offer varying products costs and experiences. This means that there are chances that you may experience a terrible service with one of several of these payment providers.

Other Fiat Withdrawal Channels

There are two other channels through which Binance users can transfer their traditional currencies off the platform. They are:

Binance’s peer-to-peer (P2P) marketplace – the P2P platform enables its users to trade with one another exchanging crypto against crypto or fiat. More than 100 different conventional currencies are supported on this platform.

Transfers to external trading platforms – it’s easy to transfer funds to other trading providers from Binance where the specific fiat withdrawal method you are interested in using is available. For example Coinbase supports PayPal deposits and withdrawals but Binance does not. If you wish to use PayPal as a withdrawal channel you have to transfer your crypto to Coinbase sell it for fiat then withdraw to your PayPal account.

Guide to withdrawing fiat currencies from Binance

This section of the article will guide how to transfer fiat currency from Binance through the three most common ways to do it highlighted above. These include using the SWIFT network to transfer US Dollars instant withdrawals using Visa/ MasterCard and third-party payments through Binance’s partner financial services.

#1. Withdraw Fiat Currency from Binance via SWIFT

Note Binance only supports USD transfers through the SWIFT channel. We also have a detailed guide to depositing USD into your Binance account via SWIFT . The guide complements this one and should be read together.

Follow the steps below to withdraw your USD from the exchange to your bank account.

Step 1 – Log in to Binance.

Access your Binance account by logging in and navigating to the Fiat and Spot Wallet page.

Hover over the [Wallet] link on the main navigation and select [Fiat and Spot] from the drop-down list.

Step 2 – Start the withdrawal process.

Click the [Withdraw] button on the Fiat and Spot page to launch the withdrawal wizard.

Alternatively you can access the [Overview] page and click the [Withdraw] button as shown below.

Step 3 – Select currency and transfer channel.

As noted earlier SWIFT transfer is available on Binance only for the USD currency. Therefore select USD on the currency tab. The SWIFT transfer option will automatically be preselected for you. If not just tap on it to show the small orange checkmark on the top right of the selection box.

Fill in the withdrawal amount to the right and click [Continue].

Step 4 – Provide your bank account details.

Since SWIFT is an inter-bank transfer you will be required to provide your banking details to receive your funds. Note that the recipient’s name must match your name on Binance or the transfer will fail.

Fill in all the mandatory fields and provide the optional information if available to ensure the transaction is successfully processed.

Step 5 – Confirm the transfer details.

In the final step Binance will prompt you to confirm the details you provided before initiating the transfer process.

Click [Confirm] if the details are correct to authorize the transfer. Provide the 2-factor authentication details to prove our identity.

SWIFT transfers typically take about four business days to complete. If you experience any further details contact your bank and the Binance customer care.

#2. Withdraw Fiat Currency from Binance via Instant Card Withdrawals

Before we continue it’s worth pointing out that not all payment cards can be used to withdraw fiat funds from Binance. Only Visa cards with the Fast Funds (Visa Direct) feature enabled can be used. If your Visa card does not have the feature contact your card provider.

Step 1 – Navigate to the ‘Fiat Withdrawal’ page.

Log in to your Binance account and navigate to the withdrawal page. You can refer to the previous section on the first two steps where we guide you on how to get to that page.

Ensure that the fiat tab is selected as shown above.

Step 2 – Fill in transaction details.

Choose which currency you wish to withdraw then select the withdrawal channel which in this case is the Bank Card (Visa). We are going to use the Euro currency as an example. The Visa card channel is available depending on the currency and availability.

The right side will automatically populate the appropriate form fields to fill i.e. the card details and the amount. One of your supported Visa cards will be preselected but you can change which card to use by clicking on the card number to reveal other available options.

If this is your first time withdrawing funds via instant card withdrawals you may have to add a card. In that case the part where you select a card will have the button to add a new card. Click on it.

Provide all the card details including the cardholder’s name number expiry date and security code.

Click on the [Add Card] button to continue.

Now that you have added a new Visa card you can select it from the previous stage and click [Continue] to proceed to the next step.

Step 3 – Confirm and authorize the transaction.

At this step Binance will prompt you to confirm the details provided. Ensure that you picked the right card to use. Also confirm that the card you have opted to use is Visa Direct-ready to avoid a failed transaction.

Click [Confirm] to proceed to the transaction authorization whereby you will provide the Google authentication code to initiate the transfer.

The funds will be deposited into your account immediately. However the transfer could take upto 24 hours to complete.

#3. Withdraw Fiat Currency from Binance via Third-party channels

Binance supports several third-party payment channels depending on currency support and geographical coverage which means that different users will have access to different third-party withdrawal methods. For this tutorial we will show you how to withdraw the Russian Ruble using the Advance Cash method but the process is similar to most other Binance payment partners.

Step 1 – Navigate to the Fiat withdrawal page.

You should easily find your way to the fiat withdrawal page from our previous sections. If not just scroll back up and revisit the first two steps of how to transfer funds from Binance via the SWIFT channel.

Choose the currency you wish to transfer once you get to the ‘Fiat Withdrawal’ page. In our example we will be withdrawing the Russian Ruble. Available options for transferring your preferred asset will appear below.

Choose a payment channel then click on the [Continue] button.

Step 2 – Provide account details.

In the Advance Cash example the follow-up step is to provide an email address linked to your AdvCash account.

Enter your AdvCash account email and click [Continue].

Step 3 – Specify the amount to transfer.

The next screen will prompt you to input an amount of the fiat currency you want to withdraw. Fill it in the Amount field.

Click [Continue] to proceed.

Step 4 – Confirm transaction details.

Ensure all the details are correct by confirming the email address and amount you want to transfer to your Advance Cash account.

Click [Confirm] to authorize the transaction.

Step 5 – Complete the transfer.

You have now successfully withdrawn your fiat balance to your third-party account. In our case that is the Advance Cash account. Binance will confirm to you that the transaction was successful.

You can opt to check your wallet balance or transaction history by clicking on either of the two buttons as shown above. Funds transfer speed will depend on the particular method you choose but the duration is relatively short.

Benefits of withdrawing fiat via fiat channels

There are two broad ways to withdraw assets from Binance and most other cryptocurrency exchanges: crypto or fiat. The latter has several benefits some of which we have already highlighted in this guide. They include:

Convenience – fiat currencies have more utility in the physical world than digital assets and withdrawing them from your online account avoids the extra process of converting or looking for a merchant that accepts crypto as payment.

Cost-effective – not all fiat-withdrawal channels are cheap but most are including the Advance Cash channel we featured above. Binance charges zero transaction fees to send your fiat balance to AdvCash wallet. Additionally most fiat payment channels charge a fixed transaction fee which favors large transfers.

Fast transaction confirmation – conventional payment methods such as using instant card withdrawals from Binance could be quicker than withdrawing some digital assets such as Bitcoin. Typically a BTC transfer will confirm after at least 10 minutes and could last up to two weeks depending on the miner fee included. Visa card withdrawals on the other hand are typically confirmed immediately.

Visa card withdrawals on the other hand are typically confirmed immediately. Binance supports several fiat currencies – there are over seventy conventional currencies supported on Binance allowing Binance users to deposit and withdraw their locally available currencies. Binance can offer such wide support because of strategic partnerships with third-party service providers giving users a custom service.

Final thoughts

In this guide you have learned some of the best ways to withdraw fiat currencies from Binance to your bank account and accounts in third-party payment services.

If you want to transfer your funds from Binance try out the three ways we highlighted above and if you need extra options there is also the peer-to-peer platform.

But even in a world where consumers across identities are 4 times more likely to trust brands that take a stand the power of truly inclusive marketing is too often passed over. Instead brands favor siloed multicultural marketing efforts that slice and dice us into segments and fail to bring us all together or worse attempts to check the box with surface-level visual representation in creative.

However 2021’s most-successful inclusive marketing moments reach for more by ambitiously addressing systemic inequities in ways that simultaneously deliver outsized business results. They show us what it looks like to embrace the reality that multiculturalism is mainstream and a more equitable future is on all of us to create. If you’re nodding your head but still not sure what to do next start with the three simple rules guiding the brands getting it right just by keeping it real.

Solve real problems

As we learned from last year’s black square-mageddon well-meaning expressions of solidarity are no substitute for tangible solutions. With True Name Mastercard masterfully showed up for the transgender community while shedding light on an overlooked indignity many are facing simply for being who they are.

Celebration does not connote elevation. —John Graham

When Lyft partnered with CVS to offer free rides to Covid-19 vaccine appointments for those in need they provided a service that made a powerful emotional connection with everyone as did Dove’s partnership with Phenomenal championing the CROWN Act did the same for Black women facing race-based hair discrimination.

There’s no shortage of real problems for brands to solve. Addressing them in ways that also support business goals naturally aligns with the very thing brand leaders have always been striving for: the ongoing alignment of purpose and profit.

Create real opportunities

Sephora’s campaign featuring “the best of Black-owned beauty for everyone” is one of the year’s most powerful examples of authentic allyship as an effective revenue strategy. Closing systemic opportunity gaps requires bold corrective action not just acknowledgment. As John Graham writes in Plantation Theory: The Black Professionals Struggle Between Freedom & Security “celebration does not connote elevation.”

From PepsiCo’s Dig In Initiative to Budweiser’s Brewing Change marketers are uniquely positioned to take advantage of the proven business case for DEI by using their power to address systemic inequities in ways that authentically honor a brand’s purpose.

Face your real history

By committing to make banking more accessible to Black communities and acknowledging systemic injustices plaguing the financial services industry to this day Citi’s Action For Racial Equity Initiative brilliantly exemplifies what it looks like to champion inclusivity from a place of open accountability. From long overdue rebranding efforts to boldly shifting outdated narratives in favor of a more inclusive reality the opportunity to cultivate a tangible sense of belonging that changes how people see and experience the world starts with facing the truth.

Know your real power

As Andrew Winston and Paul Polman write in Net Positive: How Courageous Companies Thrive By Giving More Than They Take the time for “business taking a prominent role in solving our shared challenges instead of contributing to them” is now. Brand leaders who embrace their opportunity to address systemic inequities with marketing will increasingly outshine those who falsely perceive their power as a burden.",,,,,,,,,

Behind Match.com and Tinder Took a Stand on the Texas Abortion Law (Published 2021),"When Texas lawmakers this summer passed a restrictive abortion law corporate America was largely silent. Asked to comment about one of the most divisive issues imaginable executives who had spoken up about voting rights gun control and climate change were conspicuously quiet.

Then there was Shar Dubey. As other C.E.O.s avoided the controversy Ms. Dubey — the chief executive of Match Group which runs online dating sites including Match.com OKCupid and Tinder — confronted it head-on.

“As a Texas resident I am shocked that I now live in a state where women’s reproductive laws are more regressive than most of the world including India” she said in an email to employees while announcing she was creating a fund to support Match employees affected by the new law. “Surely everyone should see the danger of this highly punitive and unfair law.”

For Ms. Dubey who has maintained a relatively low profile even while ascending to the top job at a company worth $37 billion it was an unusual foray into political activism and a reminder of the power she wields as one of the few top female executives in the technology industry.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzEyLzI0LzIyODUyOTY2L2FwcGxlLW5ldGhlcmxhbmRzLWRhdGluZy1hcHBzLW1hdGNoLXRpbmRlci1hcHAtc3RvcmUtY29tcGV0aXRpb27SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Apple must let dating apps offer alternate in-app payment options says Dutch regulator,"Apple must allow dating app developers to offer non-Apple payment systems for in-app purchases or face a hefty fine according to a detailed ruling released today from the Netherlands Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM). The regulator has been investigating the company’s App Store practices since 2019 but Reuters reports that it decided to focus on dating apps after receiving a complaint from Match Group owners of dating services like Tinder Match.com and OkCupid.

This decision doesn’t apply to other app categories like games or productivity apps in the country.

“Some app providers are dependent on Apple’s App Store and Apple takes advantage of that dependency” writes Martijn Snoep chairman of the board of ACM. “Apple has special responsibilities because of its dominant position. That is why Apple needs to take seriously the interests of app providers too and set reasonable conditions.”

In addition to allowing dating app developers to offer alternate payment systems the Dutch regulator says they should also be allowed to point users to payment options outside the app. If the company fails to do so by January 15th it faces a 5 million Euro-per-week fine up to a maximum of 50 million Euros.

The ACM says Apple takes advantage of its dominant position

Currently app developers have to use Apple’s in-app purchase system which lets the company take a 15- to 30 percent cut from any purchases customers make within an app.

In a statement to The Verge Apple spokesperson Marni Goldberg said the company “disagree[s] with the order issued by the ACM and [has] filed an appeal.” She went on to say Apple “does not have a dominant position in the market for software distribution in the Netherlands has invested tremendous resources helping developers of dating apps reach customers and thrive on the App Store and has the right under EU and Dutch law to charge developers of these apps a fee for all the services and technologies Apple provides them.”

Still governments around the world are scrutinizing Apple’s App Store rules. In September the company announced an agreement with a Japanese regulator to let “reader apps” like Netflix and Kindle point users toward external sign-up pages where customers can provide credit card info bypassing Apple’s system. South Korea passed a law in August that looks to let developers use payment systems other than the ones provided by platform owners and is reportedly deciding what Apple and Google will have to do to comply.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvZGF3bnN0YWNleWVubmlzLzIwMjEvMTIvMjUvaG93LWRhdGluZy1hcHBzLWFyZS1jb3VudGVyaW5nLWZvZGEtdGhpcy1jb3ZpZC0xOS1jaHJpc3RtYXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Dating Apps Are Countering 'FODA' This Covid-19 Christmas,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/dawnstaceyennis/2021/12/25/how-dating-apps-are-countering-foda-this-covid-19-christmas/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvZGF3bnN0YWNleWVubmlzLzIwMjEvMTIvMjUvaG93LWRhdGluZy1hcHBzLWFyZS1jb3VudGVyaW5nLWZvZGEtdGhpcy1jb3ZpZC0xOS1jaHJpc3RtYXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5lb3dpbi5uZXQvbmV3cy9kYXRpbmctYXBwcy1zaG91bGQtYmUtYWxsb3dlZC10aGlyZC1wYXJ0eS1ub24tYXBwbGUtcGF5bWVudC1zeXN0ZW1zLXJ1bGVzLWR1dGNoLXJlZ3VsYXRvci_SAXVodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZW93aW4ubmV0L2FtcC9kYXRpbmctYXBwcy1zaG91bGQtYmUtYWxsb3dlZC10aGlyZC1wYXJ0eS1ub24tYXBwbGUtcGF5bWVudC1zeXN0ZW1zLXJ1bGVzLWR1dGNoLXJlZ3VsYXRvci8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dating apps should be allowed third-party non-Apple payment systems rules Dutch regulator,"When you purchase through links on our site we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works

There has been yet another blow to the highly lucrative and profitable Apple Tax and this time it is from the Netherlands Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM). The Dutch regulator has ordered changes to the iPhone maker's App Store payment policies particularly to those concerning the 30 percent commission from every sale.

Apple must allow dating app developers to offer non-Apple payment systems for in-app purchases or face a hefty fine. If this sounds familiar that’s because it is. Epic Games first initiated this legal battle and interestingly responded after Apple threw the company out for offering third-party payment solutions within Fortnite.

According to Reuters the ACM has been investigating Apple’s App Store policies since 2019. However the regulator has singled out “Dating Apps” after receiving a complaint from Match Group. This group owns insanely popular dating services like Tinder Match.com and OkCupid.

While discussing the verdict Martijn Snoep chairman of the board of ACM noted:

“Some app providers are dependent on Apple’s App Store and Apple takes advantage of that dependency. Apple has special responsibilities because of its dominant position. That is why Apple needs to take seriously the interests of app providers too and set reasonable conditions.”

The ACM has allowed Apple until January 15 to comply. As part of the compliance process the iPhone maker must allow dating app developers to offer alternate payment systems. Additionally they should also be allowed to point users to payment options outside the app. Failure to comply could invite a €5 million per week fine up to a maximum of €50 million.

In a similar legal battle not too long ago Apple had relented and allowed app developers to use “external” means of communication such as email to inform about third-party payment options to app users. Developers couldn’t use their own apps to offer this information and facility. Moreover developers had to seek permission from app users to convey the relevant information.

Throughout its run in Ring of Honor Shane Taylor Promotions became arguably the most impressive stable in wrestling today.

The group launched Moses Kaun and O’Shay Edwards to new heights as the trio alongside Shane Taylor defended the ROH World Six-Man Tag Team Championship during their unmatched reign with the gold. Though the group lost the titles at ROH Final Battle: End of an Era Shane Taylor Promotions’ excellence is undeniable.

Taylor has previously discussed his aim to keep the group together though its members are hitting the open market in the wake of the news that ROH reportedly won’t renew the contracts of its talent roster at the end of 2021. No matter what happens next STP’s legacy will go down in ROH history.

During an interview with WrestleZone Taylor Edwards and Kaun reflected on the group’s success. First Taylor expressed his pride in the way each member of the stable has shined; though they were all talented they took the ball and ran with it when they received the opportunities that they hadn’t been getting.

“To sit here and say I feel like a proud big brother would be an understatement” said Taylor. “When I met every single one of these guys they were already supremely talented supremely confident they just needed the reps. They just needed the opportunity. You could see that they were damn near miles ahead of anybody around yet for some reason people didn’t know what to do with them they didn’t see it. They didn’t understand what they had. Seeing talent has never been an issue for me. So I knew that next to me I could provide them the opportunities and the reps that they needed.

“All I had to do was step back and watch them do what I already knew that they could do and we’ve seen it. With the growth of Kaun and Moses as a tag team it’s undeniable. They went from guys that people just were like well you know they could be good. To now you know [they’re] universally recognized as pillars of any tag team division that they walk into it. That’s not an accident. They’ve always had that in them.”

Taylor then took a moment to praise Edwards’ confidence and his successful tendency to bet on himself. “The Baddest of All Time” compared Edwards to himself before he explained that even though STP had to deal with a lot of “bulls—“ the work itself wasn’t a problem at all.

“…Even though O’Shay is older than me I wasn’t about to let that slide I’ve watched him bet on himself own every stage he’s been on whether it’s been on a Ring of Honor stage or every independent that he goes to and dominated” said Taylor. “The level of confidence that he has is scary close to mine you know what I mean and his ability to go out there just because he can and just because he wants to.

“When you have these individuals all together at the same time with the common goal while you still have to put in the work and while it was still tough navigating all the bull— the work is easy. Once we get out there and all we gotta do is fight it’s easy.”

Edwards a powerhouse who is fitting called “The Big Bad Kaiju” went on to describe how he always sought to prove his stablemates they made the right choice by taking a chance on him no matter where they happened to be competing on any given night. Given the way he thrived with the group it’s safe to say he succeeded in this regard.

“It was the day that I linked up with Shane and Moses and Kaun and they were the first group of people where I was never trying to prove them wrong I was trying to prove ’em right” said Edwards. “…It was just like ‘Nah man you’ve got the right guy. You want me let me show you why you made the right choice. And every day I stepped up into that ring it was to prove that you guys made the right choice regardless of who’s signing checks regardless of who’s in front of us regardless of whose ring we were in. It was hey man we made the right choice here.”

As for Kaun he stated that Shane Taylor Promotions collectively made six-man tag team matches important again and the group’s dominance is unrivaled in the wrestling world.

“In the end we should be talking about we made trios wrestling relevant again” said Kaun. “We are the most dominant six-man unit in professional wrestling today…and we’re the greatest six-man unit in Ring of Honor history period.”

Moving forward many fans are eager to see what the members of Shane Taylor Promotions do next. Whether they stay together or venture off on their own the stablemates will continue to pursue the group’s goal to advocate for diversity in wrestling by thriving in the ring and being a shining example of excellence.

Bob Casey goes after Dave McCormick on Connecticut residency,"PITTSBURGH (KDKA) — The race between Sen. Bob Casey and his Republican challenger former hedge fund CEO Dave McCormick is expected to be one of the most hotly contested elections in the nation.

Casey's name is synonymous with Pennsylvania especially Scranton. But it didn't take Casey long to label McCormick a Connecticut Yankee for living outside the state for many years.

""He hasn't told the truth about where he lives"" Casey said. ""He lives in Connecticut. He hasn't been truthful about that. So you have an out-of-state candidate who's being supported by out-of-state billionaires.""

KDKA-TV's Jon Delano: ""Where do you live?""

McCormick: ""I live in Pennsylvania. I live in Pittsburgh.""

Just before his run for U.S. Senate in 2022 McCormick who is divorced and remarried sold his home in Connecticut bought a home in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill and rented another home in Connecticut.

""My youngest daughter lives with her mother in Connecticut so I periodically go back to Connecticut to see my daughter. Being a good dad is even more important than being a good senator"" McCormick said.

McCormick grew up in Bloomsburg where his father was president of Bloomsburg University. But he also lived outside the state working first for the Bush administration and then as president and CEO of Bridgewater Associates a Connecticut-based multi-billion dollar hedge fund from 2009 to 2022.

McCormick sees the Connecticut residency issue as a distraction from Casey's record.

""When you have the results that Bob Casey has with inflation border crime the war on oil and gas the world falling apart what do you do? Well you try to make it about something that is unrelated in your opponent"" McCormick said.

But Casey says McCormick's long out-of-state residency coupled with his work for a hedge fund associated with multi-millionaires demonstrates who he will represent in the Senate.

""He hadn't voted in Pennsylvania in about 16 years. So I think that's going to be an issue. But I think ultimately it's going to be about whose side you are on"" Casey said.

Casey sees himself as representing hard-working middle-class Pennsylvanians while McCormick argues that Casey has failed to deliver any results.

McCormick criticizes Casey for supporting President Biden's infrastructure bill CHIPS and Science Act the Inflation Reduction Act and other bills.

""Bob Casey has been a 98% vote for Joe Biden"" McCormick said.

Casey sees himself as a soft-spoken doer who gets things done for this part of Pennsylvania.

""The bridge investment alone is about a quarter of a billion dollars just for bridges"" Casey said. ""But there's investments for K-12 education investments for communities all across the board whether it was in the infrastructure bill the American Rescue legislation or otherwise. So we've been able to get resources to communities to try to lift them up but we still have work to do so I want to keep delivering.""

The two candidates disagree on other issues as well like abortion. Casey who is personally pro-life supports the Women's Health Protection Act to codify abortion rights nationwide while McCormick opposes abortion with limited exceptions and opposes all federal legislation on the subject.

""Our states should decide"" McCormick said. ""Pennsylvania should decide as it has. My belief is that we shouldn't have bans. We shouldn't have national legislation.""

Casey says McCormick's work at the hedge fund to promote China will be another issue.

""When China cheats Pennsylvania loses jobs. So he's helped to fuel that rise of China and I think that's going to be a major issue in the campaign"" Casey said.

Delano: ""So you're suggesting he's soft on China?""

Casey: ""I don't think there's any question about it compared to what I've been doing.""

""I've been in business"" McCormick said. ""Yes my business did 2% of its business in China. I know what it's like to negotiate against the Chinese in the government and in business. There is no one better equipped to deal with the challenge of China than me.""

These are just a few of many issues on which Casey and McCormick disagree. Given the millions both campaigns will spend expect to hear a lot more in the months ahead.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iZWhpbmR0aGVzdGVlbGN1cnRhaW4uY29tL3BpdHRzYnVyZ2gtc3RlZWxlcnMtbmV3cy8yMDI0LzUvMTAvMjQxNTM5MzYvc3RlZWxlcnMtc2lnbi1yb29raWVzLW1hc29uLW1jY29ybWljay1sb2dhbi1sZWUtY29udHJhY3QtdGVybXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Steelers officially sign rookies Mason McCormick Logan Lee,"The Pittsburgh Steelers officially signed two members of their 2024 NFL Draft class Friday including fourth-round guard Mason McCormick and sixth-round DL Logan Lee. The news comes on the same day of the start of rookie minicamp taking place between Friday May 10 and Sunday May 12. Financial terms of their contracts were not disclosed.

McCormick in particular could be in a position to earn some significant playing time in the 2024 season with several question marks remaining regarding the current configuration of players on the offensive line. Should McCormick have a successful offseason he could be in the mix to compete with starting right guard James Daniels. Daniels is in the final year of his contract with the Steelers with a 2024 cap hit of just under $11.2 million. By trading or releasing Daniels the Steelers can save $8.25 million against the salary cap in 2024.

Related Steelers rookie IOL Mason McCormick could find his way to the starting lineup in 2024

Though McCormick might afford the Steelers the flexibility to make that decision on the roster It would still be a surprise to see them do so especially given the fact that they’ve got two other rookies presumably starting on the offensive line this year including OT Troy Fautanu and C Zach Frazier.

The Steelers have 43 players on their 2024 Rookie Minicamp Roster with 12 of them being rookies in this class including five undrafted free agents who received contracts. That leaves five drafted rookies remaining with whom the team will need to finalize a deal ahead of training camp including first-round OT Troy Fautanu second-round center Zach Frazier third-rounders WR Roman Wilson and LB Payton Wilson as well as sixth-round DB Ryan Watts.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vc3RlZWxlcnNkZXBvdC5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS9tYXNvbi1tY2Nvcm1pY2stcnVzc2VsbC13aWxzb24tY2FsbGVkLW1lLWFzLXNvb24tYXMtaS1nb3QtZHJhZnRlZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mason McCormick: Russell Wilson Called Me 'As Soon As I Got Drafted',"To hammer home the point one more time Russell Wilson is embracing all of his new teammates especially the ones tasked with protecting the quarterback. As he did for Troy Fautanu and several other Pittsburgh Steelers newcomers Wilson made a quick phone call to fourth-round pick Mason McCormick welcoming him to the team.

“Russell Wilson Facetimed me as soon as I got drafted” McCormick said via Erie’s JET24 News. “That was pretty cool. A lot of the vets have reached out.”

Wilson did the same or at least attempted to with Troy Fautanu who missed his initial call on his flight to Pittsburgh. The two eventually got in touch. Wilson was clearly plugged into the Steelers’ selections even on the third day of the draft rookies that aren’t always expected to make an immediate impact. McCormick was the team’s fourth-round selection and third offensive lineman selected. Primarily a guard throughout his college career he’s tabbed to begin the year as a backup behind starters Isaac Seumalo James Daniels and veteran swingman Nate Herbig.

Still offensive line depth can quickly be tested in the league. All it would take is an interior injury or two to press Mason McCormick into action to protect someone like Wilson. While he has the challenge of coming from the FCS level McCormick’s size and elite experience of nearly 60 starts will help him make the transition to the NFL level.

With one of the youngest offenses in football last year the Steelers are looking for leadership. It’s one reason why they pursued Wilson in the offseason and why he’s the front-runner to start the year ahead of Justin Fields. At 35 years old with a Super Bowl ring Wilson is regarded as a hard-worker who wants to lead and rally the group.

Beyond leadership the unit needs to be more productive an offense that’s flailed and sputtered three seasons running. Talent and skill will be the main reasons why Pittsburgh succeeds or fails but having a tight-knit team where everyone is included from starting quarterback to fourth-round guard is often a hidden factor in how to maximize a group."

The Buffalo receiver will be an even more important piece in Sunday’s matchup against New England. Bills pass-catchers Gabriel Davis and Cole Beasley are on the COVID-19 list for a game with tremendous implications in the AFC East divisional title race. The Patriots are 9-5 and Bills are 8-6.

Adjuvant treatment with Keytruda and chemotherapy—with or without radiotherapy—failed to hit the mark for disease-free survival (DFS) in newly diagnosed high-risk endometrial cancer patients who received surgery with curative intent according to an interim analysis of Merck’s late-stage KEYNOTE-B21 study. DFS refers to the length of time after a primary treatment ends that a patient survives without any signs or symptoms of their cancer.

The trial’s other primary endpoint overall survival was not formally tested because the Keytruda-chemo combo failed to reach statistical significance on the DFS metric Merck said in a Thursday release.

Merck says it’s continuing a full evaluation of the data and is working with investigators to share the results at a later date.

Endometrial cancer is the sixth most common cancer in women and the most common type of cancer in the uterus according to Merck. In the U.S. alone the company estimates roughly 67880 patients will be diagnosed with uterine body cancer this year. Merck also estimates there will be 13250 patient deaths from the disease in 2024.

“While these results were not what we had hoped we are focused on continuing to build on the established role of Keytruda in advanced endometrial carcinoma through our approved indications” Gursel Aktan M.D. Ph.D. vice president of global clinical development at Merck Research Laboratories said in a statement.

Merck will continue to test Keytruda-based combinations—plus other treatment approaches like antibody-drug conjugates (ADC)—in endometrial and other types of gynecologic cancers Aktan said.

Keytruda is already approved in patients with endometrial carcinoma that is microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR). The PD-1 inhibitor picked up that nod in 2022 following a 2017 approval that allowed the drug to cover previously treated MSI-H/dMMR tumors in patients without alternative treatment options.

Keytruda also boasts a second indication alongside Eisai-partnered Lenvima in previously treated endometrial cancer that’s not dMMR.

Over the past year Merck’s Keytruda has been sparring with GSK’s PD-1 rival Jemperli over endometrial cancer dominance in the clinic.

Last February just two months after Jemperli snagged a historic win for immunotherapy in first-line endometrial cancer Keytruda plus standard chemotherapy beat chemotherapy alone at staving off tumor progression or death in advanced or recurrent disease.

The following month at the Society of Gynecologic Oncology 2023 annual meeting both GSK and Merck provided a closer look at their meds’ late-stage performance in first-line endometrial cancer with Keytruda appearing to edge out Jemperli in MMR proficient (pMMR) patients—a key subgroup that Merck says comprises roughly two-thirds of all endometrial cancer cases.

GSK ultimately beat Merck to the finish line for a PD-1 nod in newly diagnosed disease with the company’s Jemperli in July snagging FDA clearance as an add-on to chemotherapy for patients with primary advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer but only for tumors that are mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H).

Meanwhile Merck and Eisai’s Keytruda-Lenvima combo in December missed the mark in a phase 3 study as a potential first-line treatment in certain patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma. The oncology cocktail failed to demonstrate an improvement in overall survival and progression-free survival over a regimen of platinum-based chemotherapy missing both of its primary endpoints.

While Keytruda climbed to the top of pharma's sales charts in 2023 the drug has experienced a series of clinical ups and downs in 2024.

The PD-1 inhibitor started out the year by delivering a partial win in a phase 3 study pitting the drug against high-risk localized muscle-invasive bladder cancer and locally advanced bladder cancer. Around the same time Keytruda bolstered its case as a postsurgical treatment for resectable kidney cancer with data showing it helped slash the risk of death by 38% versus placebo post-kidney removal in patients with clear cell renal carcinoma—the most common form of kidney cancer.

The drug also posted a win in cervical cancer in March. But that same month Keytruda in combination with Lynparza failed to improve patients’ life expectancy or delay progression or death when subbed in for the chemotherapy pemetrexed during maintenance treatment of newly diagnosed metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lunger cancer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vaGVhbHRoLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuaW5kaWF0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9waGFybWEvcGhhcm1hLWluZHVzdHJ5L21lcmNrcy1lbmRvbWV0cmlhbC1jYW5jZXItdGhlcmFweS1mYWlscy10cmlhbC8xMDk5ODI0OTbSAYMBaHR0cHM6Ly9oZWFsdGguZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy9waGFybWEvcGhhcm1hLWluZHVzdHJ5L21lcmNrcy1lbmRvbWV0cmlhbC1jYW5jZXItdGhlcmFweS1mYWlscy10cmlhbC8xMDk5ODI0OTY?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Merck's endometrial cancer therapy fails trial,"Join the community of 2M+ industry professionals Subscribe to our newsletter to get latest insights & analysis.

“An epidemic of diphtheria is almost inevitable here. Stop. I am in urgent need of one million units of diphtheria antitoxin. Stop. Mail is only form of transportation. Stop.”

Dr. Curtis Welch

This was the desperate radio telegram in January 1925 from Dr. Curtis Welch in Nome Alaska to all the major Alaska towns to territorial governor Scott Bone in Juneau and to the U.S. Public Health Service in Washington D.C. Diphtheria was spreading through the icebound community. Children had already died and the local supply of diphtheria antitoxin had expired the previous summer.

Known as the “Great Race of Mercy” it’s an iconic story of human compassion.

Weather prevented delivery by air so relay teams of sled dogs and their mushers raced against the clock to deliver 300000 units of antitoxin which was produced by Merck legacy company H.K. Mulford. They completed the 674-mile journey over what later became known as the Iditarod Trail in a record-breaking five days and seven hours despite whiteout conditions and temperatures of 50 degrees below zero.

674 miles 5 days 300000 units

Over 130 years of vaccine leadership In 1895 the H.K. Mulford Company began marketing the first commercially available diphtheria antitoxin in the U.S. the very medication that helped avert the diphtheria epidemic in Nome. Today we have a significant presence in vaccine discovery development and distribution in both human and animal health.

The vaccine pioneers Merck’s Dr. Maurice Hilleman belongs to a distinguished group of vaccine pioneers — including Edward Jenner Louis Pasteur Jonas Salk and Albert Sabin. Hilleman is credited with helping to develop more than 40 vaccines and his impact on public health is undeniable. Learn more

Vaccines are not just for children

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention consider vaccines to be one of the 10 great public health achievements of the 20th century. In the U.S. vaccines are now available for a number of infectious diseases that once routinely affected people. While there are many vaccines available for children it’s important to remember that adults also are susceptible to vaccine-preventable infectious diseases.

Each year in the U.S. thousands of adults suffer complications from these diseases. In low- and middle-income countries the toll is even higher.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2V3b3JsZC5uZXQvMjAyNC8wNS8xMi9tZXJjay1rZ2FhLW90Y21rdHNta2tneS1zZWVzLXNpZ25pZmljYW50LWRyb3AtaW4tc2hvcnQtaW50ZXJlc3QuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Merck KGaA (OTCMKTS:MKKGY) Sees Significant Drop in Short Interest,"Merck KGaA (OTCMKTS:MKKGY – Get Free Report) was the target of a large decline in short interest in the month of April.

Moscow has increased pressure on Big Tech this year in a campaign that critics characterise as an attempt by the Russian authorities to exert tighter control over the internet something they say threatens individual and corporate freedom.

Google said in an email it would study the court ruling on Friday before deciding on further steps.

Later on Friday the court fined Meta Platforms $27.15m on the same grounds. Russia’s communication watchdog Roskomnadzor said that Facebook and Instagram failed to remove 2000 pieces that violate Russian laws whereas Google keeps 2600 pieces of banned content.

Meta Platforms did not immediately respond to request for comment.

Russia has imposed small fines on foreign technology companies throughout this year but Friday’s penalties mark the first time it has exacted a percentage of a company’s annual Russian turnover greatly increasing the sum of the fine.

It did not specify the percentage although calculations by the Reuters news agency show Google’s fine equates to just over 8 percent.

Russia has ordered companies to delete posts promoting drug abuse and dangerous pastimes information about homemade weapons and explosives as well as ones by groups it designates as extremist or “terrorist”.

Google which has paid more than $434560 in fines over content violations this year is at odds with Moscow on a number of issues.

Russia has demanded it restore access to state-backed broadcaster RT’s German-language channels.

Last week a sanctioned Russian businessman claimed victory over Google in a court case that could see the tech giant hit with another heavy fine.

Moscow has also demanded that 13 foreign and mostly US technology companies which include Google and Meta Platforms be set up on Russian soil by January 1 or face possible restrictions or outright bans.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZhc3Rjb21wYW55LmNvbS85MDcwNzkzMS80LWVzc2VudGlhbC1waWVjZXMtb2YtcmVzZWFyY2gtdGhhdC1leHBsYWluLW1ldGEtZmFjZWJvb2tzLXByb2JsZW1zL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,4 essential pieces of research that explain Meta-Facebook's problems,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.fastcompany.com/90707931/4-essential-pieces-of-research-that-explain-meta-facebooks-problems/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZhc3Rjb21wYW55LmNvbS85MDcwNzkzMS80LWVzc2VudGlhbC1waWVjZXMtb2YtcmVzZWFyY2gtdGhhdC1leHBsYWluLW1ldGEtZmFjZWJvb2tzLXByb2JsZW1zL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnhydG9kYXkuY29tL3ZpcnR1YWwtcmVhbGl0eS93aGF0LWlzLW1ldGFzLXZvaWNlLXNkay1kaXNjb3Zlci1hLW5ldy13YXktdG8tbmF2aWdhdGUtdGhlLW1ldGF2ZXJzZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What is Meta's Voice SDK? Discover a New Way to Navigate the Metaverse,"Over the last few years voice has become a popular mode for navigating the digital world – from looking up queries online to getting directions while driving.

It is estimated that around 22% of internet users use voice commands to control their media and television devices and around 40% of smartphone users feel that voice technology significantly improves the mobile UX.

Therefore it makes sense that users would want to leverage the convenience of voice in every type of operating environment at work at home or even inside virtual worlds.

Facebook (now Meta) has recently announced an offering called Voice SDK to help bring voice commands and related technologies into the VR space and potentially one day the metaverse.

Defining Voice SDK

Voice SDK can be defined as a software development kit that assembles key natural language capabilities required to design hands-free navigation systems in immersive realities including AR VR and MR.

The primary use case as Meta highlights would be voice-based gameplay – but one could expect numerous other applications for collaborating in VR VR content consumption and much more.

Voice SDK is part of the company’s Presence Platform for Oculus developers which gives you machine perception and AI tools to start building highly immersive experiences.

It was announced during Connect 2021 and Meta has said that the Voice SDK will be available soon in an experimental release.

Importantly documentation for the solution is yet to become available and we expect a full release next year with the GA version of the Presence Platform.

Voice SDK is Powered by Wit.ai

From early on Facebook kept its ear to the ground and was quick to pick up any new technologies or platforms it felt might come in handy later down the line.

In the last 2-3 years this has primarily comprised immersive reality companies in the lead-up to Facebook’s rebranding as Meta this year.

But in addition to acquiring VR startups and early movers Facebook purchased a tiny fledgling company back in 2015 – called Wit.ai.

At that time Wit.ai was fresh out of Y Combinator and had built an API for voice-enabled interfaces. It saw remarkable growth in a very short time and had over 6000 developers using it when it was acquired by Facebook.

The use case back then was simple: provide a voice-to-text capability for Facebook Messenger and possibly monetise any apps built using Wit. Notably the service was to remain free for use.

Fast forward to 2021 and Wit.ai continues to be available as a free tool (provided you are a Facebook user) and extremely popular among the developer community for its simple elegant yet powerful natural language API.

In October 2021 at Connect Meta announced that Wit.ai would power the Voice SDK component of the Presence Platform now bringing this technology to the XR space.

How Will Voice SDK Transform AR/VR Experiences?

Voice is typically used in scenarios where hand-based controls aren’t available or advisable.

So does it make sense for developers to go the extra mile and bring this capability into virtual worlds where users will have their controllers anyway?

We’d say yes. By reducing dependence on tracked hand controllers Voice SDK enabled more naturalised interactions in VR worlds which are dramatically closer to life. Here are some of its transformative impacts:

1. Users can navigate the metaverse without using hand controllers

The metaverse is by definition a conglomeration of many VR worlds and the user navigates between them for work play social and other purposes. Voice SDK will allow users to navigate using spoken commands without having to turn to their hand controllers.

Use cases like teleportation inside VR could rely on Voice SDK in a big way and users could be empowered to move from one world to another while engaged in other activities.

2. There can be voice-driven commands in game-play

Voice commands for games is an important application for this technology one that we expect to roll out very soon.

Meta provides a couple of examples of this use case in its October 2021 announcement including the ability to talk to characters and NPCs and the ability to achieve game milestones through a voice-activated magic spell.

In short Voice SDK could transform multi-player experiences as we know it through an advanced text-to-speech capability.

3. Users will be able to set voice reminders to self

Another small but handy use case for the SDKs natural language tools is in-VR reminders. Self-reminders are a popular application for voice technology particularly when using virtual assistants or smart home hubs.

Thanks to Voice SDK developers can now allow users to set reminders to themselves through voice commands.

For instance when conducting a multi-participant meeting in VR you’d be able to make a memo-to-self without having to take off your headset or switch apps.

4. Virtual objects can be searched using voice

Similar to voice reminders voice search is another popular use case for this technology.

Developers will now be able to bring voice search into VR with Voice SDK allowing users to look for objects through spoken commands.

5. FAQs and help sections will support voice interactions

Long text repositories in the Oculus ecosystem such as FAQ questionnaires or an application’s help section can be made searchable via voice. Without a traditional mouse or keyboard system looking up information help portals was always difficult in VR.

More often than not users had to resort to their 2-dimensional web presence to find answers to their queries.

Now Voice SDK will power a seamless intuitive and uninterrupted application experience with routine support available and help via voice.

Start Using Voice SDK with Presence Platform

Following October’s announcement Meta announced that the experimental release of Voice SDK was now available starting November 2021.

Unity developers can start using Voice SDK from the Oculus for Developers portal and support for non-unity platforms is slated for the future.

Keep in mind that Voice SDK Experimental cannot be shipped with applications – for that you will have to wait for the production version of Voice SDK expected by the end of 2021.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2xhdXJlbmRlYnRlci8yMDIxLzEyLzI1L2Zhc2hpb24tYW5kLXRoZS1tZXRhdmVyc2Utd2h5LXJhbHBoLWxhdXJlbi13YW50cy10by1zZWxsLXlvdS1kaWdpdGFsLWNsb3RoaW5nL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fashion And The Metaverse: Why Ralph Lauren Wants To Sell You Digital Clothing,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurendebter/2021/12/25/fashion-and-the-metaverse-why-ralph-lauren-wants-to-sell-you-digital-clothing/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2xhdXJlbmRlYnRlci8yMDIxLzEyLzI1L2Zhc2hpb24tYW5kLXRoZS1tZXRhdmVyc2Utd2h5LXJhbHBoLWxhdXJlbi13YW50cy10by1zZWxsLXlvdS1kaWdpdGFsLWNsb3RoaW5nL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWxpbmZvcm1hdGlvbndvcmxkLmNvbS8yMDIxLzEyL2hlcmUtYXJlLW1vc3QtcG9wdWxhci1zb2NpYWwtbWVkaWEuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here Are the Most Popular Social Media Platforms in the World (And the Companies Behind Them),Well over half of the global population around 57% to be precise uses some form of social media in order to make it so that they can connect with one another in some way shape or form. Despite this massive number of users and the fact that they are spread pretty much all around the world the vast majority of social media is controlled by a handful of companies. For example four out of the five most widely used social media platforms currently out there are owned by one company Meta.Meta which was formerly called Facebook before it rebranded and Facebook became just one of its many subsidiaries owns WhatsApp Instagram and Messenger as well. That gives it 2.9 billion users from Facebook 2 billion from WhatsApp and 1.3 billion apiece from Messenger and Instagram. That makes it one of the most powerful players in a thoroughly monopolized social media landscape since at least a third of the world’s population has an account on one of Meta’s platforms.Meta’s only major competitor was Alphabet with YouTube being this company’s only social media centered player in this regard. With nearly 2.3 billion monthly active users YouTube is the second biggest social media platform in the world apart from Facebook and it might just be the only one that can give Facebook a run for its money. That’s something that can be seen in Facebook consistently trying to directly compete with YouTube through things like Facebook watch and IGTV although these attempts have not garnered any major success as of yet.The top five social media platforms in the world by monthly active user count are all owned by American companies and four of them are owned by Meta specifically. However once you move out of the top five you would start to notice China’s relative success in this area. With over 1.2 billion users WeChat is the 6th biggest social media platform in the world with TikTok and a similar app named Kuaishou rounding off the social media platforms with over 1 billion monthly active users.With all of that having been said and now out of the way it is important to note that except for TikTok no other Chinese social media platform has found any significant amount of success outside of China. Out of the four Chinese entries in the top ten list only TikTok has managed to become relevant although the fact that it has pretty much taken the world of social media by storm and changed it entirely is something that should be noted as an indicator that the dominance of American social media might be on the decline especially when you consider the bad press that Meta has been receiving as of late.There is one entry on the list that comes from neither China nor the US but from the UAE. This is Telegram a popular messaging platform that has managed to gain 600 million active monthly users so far and has become a common alternative for people that want to use platforms other than the ones owned by Meta which often involves foregoing the use of WhatsApp as well.H/T: VC Read next: Hazardous Consoles: Gaming is fun for all but not for our planet

Coach Darrell Bevell confirmed Robinson's injury after the Jaguars' 26-21 loss at MetLife Stadium and he is expected to undergo surgery that will end his season after 14 games.

The injury occurred with about three minutes remaining in the first quarter when Robinson came out of his stance after the snap and dropped to the turf without contact. Before he was attended to by the Jaguars training staff he was seen holding the back of his ankle. He was helped off the field and then was carted off from the sideline.

Robinson appeared to be in tears with a towel over his head.

He ends his second season in Jacksonville with 767 yards rushing on 164 carries in 14 games.

Before Urban Meyer was fired earlier this month Robinson was at the center of controversy after getting benched against both the Atlanta Falcons and Los Angeles Rams after fumbles. Meyer didn't give a straight answer for three days after Robinson was benched for 20 plays telling the media they needed to speak with running backs coach Bernie Parmalee.

Ultimately quarterback Trevor Lawrence stood up for Robinson saying that he needs to be on the field.

Pederson Caldwell will be among candidates to interview with Jags

A league source confirmed Sunday that owner Shad Khan is compiling a list of potential candidates to be interviewed for the head coaching job and both former NFL head coaches Doug Pederson and Jim Caldwell are on it.

Khan can begin interviewing candidates on Tuesday because of a new NFL rule implemented this season. The Jaguars fired Urban Meyer on Dec. 16 and named offensive coordinator Darrell Bevell as interim coach for the remainder of the regular season.

Peterson 53 began his coaching career under Andy Reid serving as an assistant for the Eagles from 2009-12. After Reid became the head coach of the Kansas City Chiefs in 2013 Pederson followed him to serve as the Chiefs' offensive coordinator. He returned to the Eagles as their head coach in 2016 a position he held for five seasons. He led the Eagles to the first Super Bowl title in franchise history during the 2017 season. Pederson played 13 seasons in the NFL as a backup quarterback.

Caldwell was the Detroit Lions' head coach from 2014 to 2017 and led the team to two playoff appearances in four seasons. He also led the Colts to a Super Bowl appearance in 2009 but they lost to the Saints. He had two winning seasons in three years with the Colts but was fired after going 2-14 in 2011 when Peyton Manning missed the entire season after undergoing neck surgery. Caldwell who will turn 67 on Jan. 16 has not coached since 2019 when he was the assistant head coach/quarterbacks coach for the Miami Dolphins.

Myles Jack joins Josh Allen on COVID-19 list before Sunday's game

Earlier this week Jaguars did not have any players currently on the COVID-19 list for testing positive despite the surge caused by the newer and more contagious variant of the coronavirus Omicron.

However the Jaguars had four starters miss Sunday's game against the New York Jets because they were placed on the COVID-19 list: outside linebackers Josh Allen and Myles Jack wide receiver Laviska Shenault and offensive guard Ben Bartch.

The franchise announced three hours before kickoff that Jack did not clear COVID protocols. Rookie reserve defensive end/outside linebacker Jordan Smith also was placed on the virus list.

Allen is the only one of the five players who publicly disclosed earlier this season that he is not vaccinated. Allen must sit out at least 10 days and come back with two negative tests before he can rejoin the team.

He will miss Sunday's game against the New York Jets and the team's Jan. 2 game at New England. It will be Allen's first games missed this season.

''[Even] If I was vaccinated I will [still] always take care of myself'' Allen said. ''I have a young family at home so I try to not only protect myself but protect them as well. [We have a] Newborn at the house and we had a scary situation at my house so definitely put me on extra precaution. For me I come to work and wear my mask and made the decision for myself and my family so now I have to stick with it.''

The surge in COVID-19 cases across the league caused the NFL to reschedule three Week 15 games to this week. The Las Vegas Raiders-Cleveland Browns game was played Monday night while Seattle's game at the Los Angeles Rams and Washington's game at Philadelphia were played Tuesday.

New York Jets coach Robert Saleh missed Sunday's game because of having a positive COVID-19 test. Former Jaguars assistant Ron Middleton served as the Jets interim head coach Sunday. On Wednesday the Jets had 17 players on the COVID-19 list.

The bow-wielding streaming series celebrated the holidays in style offering up Clint Barton's first titular role in the and introducing Hailee Steinfeld's Kate Bishop into the fray. Taking place in New York the show was a chance for fans to reengage with a Marvel and Avengers locale they have become so accustomed to over the years.

And though Hawkeye did hit its mark in answering some interesting questions within the MCU it also reiterated a few that fans have had for what feels like years. One of these is who exactly bought Avengers Tower?

The former NYC headquarters of Earth's Mightiest Heroes was sold off in Spider-Man: Homecoming but the mysterious buyer has yet to come forward.

This building is an important piece of real estate in the Marvel Universe (or Multiverse at this point) but some eagle-eyed fans pointed out that not only does the tower have a new owner in Hawkeye but it also seems to have disappeared off the face of the map.

Where's Avengers Tower in Hawkeye?

As posted by a Marvel fan on Reddit Hawkeye features a mistake in the MCU's fictional New York City skyline. Where Avengers Tower should be standing is the MetLife Building an actual piece of architecture that sits in the real-life plot where Avengers Tower would be in the MCU.

In an establishing shot to the Disney+ series' finale the MetLife Building can be seen at the bottom of the screen which is odd because that structure doesn't exist in the MCU.

In real-life New York the MetLife building is found directly behind the busy Grand Central Terminal in Midtown Manhattan.

MetLife Building

And Grand Central is a location that fans have seen in the MCU particularly in Avengers: Age of Ultron.

Upon panning up from Grand Central in Age of Ultron it can be seen that the building behind it is not the MetLife Building but rather the Avengers Tower.

Avengers: Age of Ultron

In a similar erroneous manner Daredevil and other Marvel Netflix shows which existed in the Avengers' universe also accidentally featured the MetLife Building in their own city skyline shots.

A Simple Hawkeye Mess Up

Simple goofs and mistakes happen like this all the time in movies and TV. IMDB has a whole section devoted to these little mishaps.

No this does not mean the Avengers Tower has been purchased by MetLife mowed down and now insurance will be sold where Cap and Thor once stood. Marvel is not impervious to these kinds of mistakes.

The fact that the MetLife logo appears briefly and in such a small portion of the shot should be an indication that this was simply something that fell through the cracks. And even if it was noticed it probably would not have been worth the CGI time and budget to get rid of it in time for Hawkeye's finale.

And Hawkeye is not alone on this island either. In 2021 the MCU has seen its fair share of whoopsies and plot holes.

Just look at Spider-Man: No Way Home. Whether it was a particular villain's memory of Peter Parker breaking the logic of the film or the Lizard taking a phantom punch in trailers No Way Home alone had more than a few goofs.

So don't hold this one small mistake against Hawkeye. Surely the question of who bought Avengers Tower will be answered fans just need to be patient.

All around the NFL (and each pro league) teams are being hit hard by the coronavirus and Robert Saleh is not expected to coach for the Jets after testing positive. Among the many position groups affected is at safety where the Jets might sign two players signed this week.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ueWRhaWx5bmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMS8xMi8yNS9wYXQtbGVvbmFyZHMtbmZsLW5vdGVzLWlmLXJ1c3NlbGwtd2lsc29uLWlzLWF2YWlsYWJsZS10aGVuLWdpYW50cy1oYXZlLXRvLXB1cnN1ZS10aGUtcG9zc2liaWxpdHkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Leonard: Giants have to have the Russell Wilson conversation,"Russell Wilson instantly would give the Giants credibility something this organization hasn’t had in a long time.

Wilson’s talent and pedigree precede him. If he wants New York and the Seahawks are willing to trade him then buckle up for some drama this spring.

Because the Giants would be obligated to discuss that possibility both internally and with Seattle regardless of whether they actually pulled the trigger on a deal.

The Giants’ current offensive identity is rudderless compared to how it might function with Wilson in shotgun at MetLife Stadium. John Mara has long been searching for a way to catch up with the NFL’s modern offenses.

Wilson would bring the confidence to help shape a better offense. He has the ability to create something out of nothing. And he most definitely would put fans in the seats something Mara cares about deeply and hasn’t been able to accomplish for years.

It’s worth remembering however that the Seahawks turned down the Chicago Bears’ offer last offseason of three first-round picks a third-round pick and Seattle’s choice of two big-name starters on the Bears’ roster according to multiple reports.

Russell Wilson might be available in an offseason trade and the Giants have to be involved in the conversation.

Wilson who has a no-trade clause asked Seattle for permission to discuss trades directly with other teams last offseason. And the Seahawks denied it per NFL Network.

Plus he’s scheduled to carry cap hits of $37 million and $40 million in the final two years of his current contract per overthecap.com and the Giants are so cap-strapped that they’re running out of player deals to restructure to spare a few bucks.

So the price in a Wilson trade would be exorbitant. And that’s only if Seahawks GM John Schneider and coach Pete Carroll were willing to entertain the idea in the first place. And if they did trade him he’d cost a fortune.

That’s a lot of ifs. Not to mention there would be other suitors to contend with maybe even the division rival Philadelphia Eagles who were big-game QB hunters last offseason and who now hold three first-round picks in April’s NFL Draft.

The Giants do hold two top 10 picks themselves in a draft projected as thin on top talent including at quarterback. So if there were a year to package that capital in a trade for a star player this is it.

Still the Giants’ roster remains in desperate need of top talent and depth at key positions all over the depth chart from edge rusher to offensive line to corner and on and on.

Trading draft capital would leave the cupboard bare. The Giants would be asking Wilson to be their great eraser of those deficiencies.

The only problem is that Wilson 33 hasn’t even been able to mask a poor offensive line and roster shortcomings on the Seahawks. He is 4-7 as a starter this season. His Seahawks are 5-9.

He wasn’t able to escape injury this fall and he’s no spring chicken even if he has aspirations of playing for a long time.

He’s only gone 3-5 in the playoffs since his back-to-back Super Bowl appearances in 2013-14. He hasn’t been back to the NFC Championship Game since.

The most recent Wilson-Giants connection came from a report a few weeks ago by independent reporter Jordan Schultz. He said Wilson would strongly consider a trade to the Giants Denver Broncos and New Orleans Saints. NFL Network backed that list up too.

The Giants’ idea is not a new one. Colin Cowherd reported in February 2019 that he’d heard Wilson’s wife Ciara a singer and entertainer wanted to live in New York and so Wilson’s football career might take him East.

Interestingly though when Wilson wanted out of Seattle this past offseason the Giants weren’t on the four-team list reported by ESPN. His list at that time included the Bears the Las Vegas Raiders the Dallas Cowboys and the Saints.

Notice the only overlap on Wilson’s two lists in the last 12 months: New Orleans.

The Saints are scrambling post-Drew Brees to fix their quarterback position. Sean Payton loves Wilson’s game (don’t most coaches?) and Wilson would be pairing himself with one of the NFL’s top offensive minds on a sure playoff team.

The Eagles aren’t on any of Wilson’s lists but they might intrigue him from a talent and competitive standpoint too. The unanswered question there obviously is whether GM Howie Roseman will ride with Jalen Hurts after contending for a playoff spot or if he’d view Wilson or Deshaun Watson as the player who would take his team over the top.

All of that potential competition doesn’t mean the Giants shouldn’t explore a match. They’re so lost on offense any move to improve their production must be explored.

So few players view the Giants as a destination nowadays too that if Wilson actually picked the Giants that alone would boost the franchise’s standing regardless of whether he won.

Giving Daniel Jones one more year with a healthier improved roster remains the more likely outcome. Joe Judge seems earnest in his support of the young quarterback into 2022 assuming he fully recovers from his neck injury which the team expects.

But with Dave Gettleman headed out Jones no longer will have the GM who drafted him running the show. And that means no preordained allegiance to anything or anyone except improving the product on the field.

That will mean a call to Seattle even if the Seahawks ultimately refuse to engage or Wilson ends up taking his talents elsewhere.

TESTING TESTING…

The NFL had 320 players test positive for COVID-19 in a 12-day span between Monday Dec. 13 and Thursday when 46 more players went on the Covid reserve list. NFL Network reported the majority of the 320 positives have little or no symptoms as the Omicron variant sprints through the league.

The rash of positives prompted three postponements last weekend and meant the NFL had games played on five of the seven days during Christmas week. Only Wednesday and Friday lacked live televised pro football.

Giants players’ union representative Logan Ryan said the past couple weeks have “been chaos” and that “there’s fear” and “there’s stress.” He was joining an NFLPA call Thursday to discuss the “ever-changing” protocols that Ryan admitted “are very confusing for everybody.”

Ryan who just got over COVID himself a month ago didn’t personally seem to understand the NFL’s new adjusted testing protocol that abruptly changed seemingly designed to help complete the regular season. The league and union stopped weekly testing of vaccinated players and staff in favor of less frequent “targeted testing” of sample groups.

“You worry about not testing that everyone is just going to have it and not know about it” Ryan said. “It’s almost like you’re choosing between health and safety or getting paid and those are tough tough choices for anyone to make. Do I want to sacrifice my health to get paid? It may be the health of others it may be the health of family members and older people and my grandparents and those so it’s a serious conversation.”

FOR SALE SIGN

New Florida head coach Billy Napier is targeting Giants offensive line coach Rob Sale for his new Gators staff per The Athletic. Sale worked for Napier at Louisiana before joining Judge with the Giants. Judge and Napier worked together on Alabama’s staff in 2011.

Sale presumably will either get a new job or a raise out of Napier’s pursuit. If he leaves Judge would be seeking his fourth offensive line coach entering his third season following Marc Colombo Dave DeGuglielmo and Sale. Judge would do well in that case to consider promoting assistant offensive line coach Ben Wilkerson who has put in his time and has the players’ respect.

THEY SAID IT

“…” — The full extent of Giants practice squad offensive lineman Isaiah Wilson’s public comments since signing on Sept. 30: nothing. The team has not made the controversial and disgraced former first-round pick available once despite weekly — and often daily — requests."

I was four years old it was 1996 and my parents had just driven myself my brother and my grandma (Magaw as we called her) from the Texas panhandle to the Las Vegas Strip to celebrate Christmas in style.

We weren't staying at The Mirage.

In fact we were on the far end of the Strip at the MGM Grand but I can still remember if just for a fleeting second how magical it felt to enter that larger-than-life space. Above me the glass atrium felt like a spaceship people from all walks of life floated by in every direction slot machines were dinging and rattling coins were jingling in large plastic buckets and as far as the pictures show — I was enthralled.

But the thing I remember the most were the fish a giant wall of them full of more shapes colors and designs than any little boy from rural cotton-growing ""Friday Night Lights"" West Texas had ever seen. That was the moment when I fell in love with The Mirage — and hotels as a whole.

Now flash forward a quarter of a century and my love for The Mirage hasn't changed. Though I may have ditched my stroller and OshKosh B'gosh overalls every time I visit Las Vegas it's essential for me to walk under that big glass dome and say hi to those fish though now it's usually while I'm in line to check in to the hotel instead of gawking from a distance.

When The Mirage opened its doors for the first time back in 1989 three years before I came into existence it changed the world — at least the hotel world.

Set on 77 acres Las Vegas mogul Steve Wynn set out to build a megaresort. And he did. At the time it was the largest hotel on the planet and it redefined what a resort could with its sprawling size seemingly endless dining options toned down but visible theme (technically Polynesian in case you were wondering) and overall sense of luxury.

It also opened up Las Vegas as a family-friendly destination thanks to its over-the-top erupting volcano Siegfried & Roy's magic show featuring white tigers and the chance to temporarily escape the mundaneness of everyday life to feel like you and your family entered a tropical paradise hidden in the middle of the Nevada desert. A mirage if you will.

Since that first trip to Las Vegas back when my wallet (also OshKosh) only held a library card I've returned countless times. And in a way over the years it feels like I've grown up with The Mirage which became an MGM property in 2000 and was just acquired by Hard Rock International.

On those earlier trips (mostly work trips my parents let me tag along on) we'd slip into The Mirage for a buffet free-for-all or step out on the Strip to watch the volcano. My parents would usually let me pick out a slot machine that ""felt right"" and one would play $5 while the other stood back with me on the kid-designated carpet.

The summer before my senior year of high school my relationship with The Mirage ascended to a whole new level. My mom booked a massive suite to stay in for a work trip and let me invite a friend. Over the course of a long weekend we lounged in the dry summer heat by the pool drank Dr Pepper from champagne glasses saw ""The Beatles LOVE"" by Cirque du Soleil and generally acted like we owned the place. It was a great story to tell our friends back in the sleepy town of Levelland Texas.

Before I knew it I was 21 and my wallet — now Coach maybe American Eagle — had my driver's license my college ID and an MGM player's card. Then I was drinking Champagne from a champagne glass and feeling too scared to sit down at a blackjack table. I'd spend hours playing penny slots with my dad my mom anchored down at a craps table.

It was at The Mirage the first time I won big — $800 on an Ellen-themed slot machine. And it was Howie Mandle's voice at the Deal or No Deal machine tucked away between the bathroom and the ticket office that frequently convinced me to say ""no deal"" sometimes for better and sometimes for worse.

For Christmas of 2019 my family shared a suite at The Mirage the last time we'd see each other for more than 15 months due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It was the silly memories of 2 a.m. steak and eggs me still trying to learn to play craps from my mom and everyone recounting their antics the next morning that held me through that long separation.

And then just this month we evolved again. Celebrating my best friend's 30th birthday 15 friends gathered yet again in a two-bedroom suite on top of The Mirage. This time I saw my favorite casino through the blurry lens of old college friends celebrating the privilege of getting older.

We danced with cowboys in the sportsbook to a live country band; we scouted out the machines that ""felt right"" just like my parents taught me; and we had a moment when we looked around and realized how weird it was that we'd all ""grown up.""

Mostly we talked about how annoying it was that I knew every nook and cranny across the resort's 77 acres.

Soon we'll say goodbye to The Mirage and hello to the Hard Rock Las Vegas. The volcano will have one more triumphant explosion and then be paved over to build a larger-than-life building in the shape of a guitar.

After that who knows what next? I don't even know what's next for me. We've aged and we've changed — and we'll change again. But what won't change and I'm certain of it are the memories I made over the years in the hotel that will always feel like my hotel.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL3RoZWF0aGxldGljLmNvbS8zNjg2NDMwLzIwMjEvMTIvMjUvc3B1cnMtYXNzaXN0YW50LWJlY2t5LWhhbW1vbi1iZWluZy1zZXJpb3VzbHktcHVyc3VlZC1ieS1hY2VzLWxpYmVydHktZm9yLWhlYWQtY29hY2hpbmctdmFjYW5jaWVzLXNvdXJjZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Spurs assistant Becky Hammon being seriously pursued by Aces Liberty for head coaching vacancies: Sources,"The New York Liberty and Las Vegas Aces are seriously pursuing San Antonio Spurs assistant and WNBA legend Becky Hammon to be their respective franchise’s new head coach and Hammon has a mutual interest in making a potential jump sources tell The Athletic.

If Hammon chooses to accept either the Liberty or Aces job it’s expected to take place in the lead up to the WNBA’s January free agency sources tell The Athletic.

The Liberty head coaching job is currently open after New York and Walt Hopkins parted ways in early December. The Aces job is currently filled by Bill Laimbeer who has coached in the WNBA since 2002. If Hammon were to accept the Aces job Laimbeer would step aside and potentially fill a different organizational role sources said.

Hammon played 16 seasons in the WNBA the first eight with the New York Liberty and the second eight with the San Antonio Stars. She retired in 2014 and in 2018 when MGM Grand Resorts International bought the Stars and moved the team to Las Vegas renaming the franchise the Aces.

Since becoming an assistant coach on Gregg Popovich’s Spurs staff in 2014 Hammon has had a lot of firsts. In July 2015 Hammon became the first-ever female to serve as head coach in NBA Summer League leading the Spurs’ summer team to a championship. In 2018 she became the first woman to ever be interviewed for an NBA head coaching job when she spoke to the Milwaukee Bucks. On Dec. 30 2020 Hammon served as acting head coach when Popovich was ejected in a game against the Los Angeles Lakers.

Last offseason Hammon interviewed with the Orlando Magic and Portland Trail Blazers. She became the first woman to reach the finalist stage of an NBA head coaching search process when she was one of the last candidates to meet with Portland ownership before the hiring of Chauncey Billups.

In January 2021 Raiders owner Mark Davis bought the Aces and in May the franchise hired Nikki Fargas to be the team president. Both Davis and Fargas have expressed how important it is to the Aces to be well connected with former players from every iteration of the Aces (Utah Starzz San Antonio Silver Stars and the San Antonio Stars). As a part of those efforts the Aces retired Hammon’s No. 25 jersey this past September.

“It’s another huge honor. I really appreciate the Aces digging back into the program’s history and honoring the people that came before” she said. “I think that’s how you build culture. That’s how you build character within your organization. And I think Mark Davis and the ownership group trying to really make it a family affair and bring in the previous organizations and the players that impacted not just the Aces but the Stars and the WNBA and honoring that legacy is super special.”

The Liberty parted ways with Hopkins in early December after two seasons with the franchise. Hopkins worked closely with GM Jonathan Kolb on a “rebuild hybrid” that resulted in the franchise going 12-20 and making the playoffs in 2021 after going 2-20 in the 2020 bubble season.

The Aces have finished first in the WNBA West over the past two years with A’ja Wilson winning regular-season MVP honors in 2020. Laimbeer’s style has relied far more on interior play and getting to the free-throw line while much of the rest of the league Liberty included have drawn their offense out to lean heavily on 3-pointers. It is worth noting that the Aces GM job is currently open after former GM Dan Padover left to be the Atlanta Dream GM in October.

What would Hammon returning to the WNBA represent?

Chantel Jennings senior WNBA reporter: She has always been a name that would be thrown around in vacancies as a “dream hire” so for a franchise — either the Liberty or Aces — to land a coach who is not only a WNBA alumnus but also a current NBA assistant who appeared to be on track to be an NBA head coach would be quite the coup.

Franchises have talked a lot about getting former players involved in coaching and the front office but Hammon’s return to the league would be a huge boost in the 26th season for both validation of the league and its publicity.

Where would Hammon be a better fit?

Jennings: Both franchises are in different spots but she would help both in their current existences.

In New York she’d be tasked with developing a team around one of the most exciting young guards in the league — Sabrina Ionescu — while continuing to build the franchise out of an extended losing period. With the Aces she’d be handed the keys to a car that already has a lot of the pieces in place but has yet to get over the championship hump.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoZWF0c2hlZXQuY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvdGhlLWdpcmxzLW5leHQtZG9vci13aGVyZS1pcy1ob2xseS1tYWRpc29uLW5vdy5odG1sL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'The Girls Next Door': Where Is Holly Madison Now?,"Holly Madison was a star on 'The Girls Next Door.'

In the 2000s The Girls Next Door gave people an inside look. One of the stars was Holly Madison and she was one of Hefner’s partners. She went on to continue her successful career after she left the show.

‘The Girls Next Door’ was all about Hugh Hefner and his girlfriends

The Girls Next Door is a reality series that Hefner helped create. The show centers around the lives of his girlfriends. They all reside in the Playboy Mansion in LA. The series first aired in 2005 and ran for six seasons.

In the beginning the premise would have been about Hefner raising his son. People would have seen his daily life of helping his kid with his homework. However Hefner was not fond of the idea and changed the focus toward his partners.

For the first five seasons Hefner had three girlfriends in the limelight. Out of the three Kendra Wilkinson became the biggest star. However his relationship with all three of them eventually came to an end. The sixth season featured a new set of girlfriends but fans got to see the previous ones return.

Throughout the show various events took place in the famous mansion. Examples include the Fourth of July celebration and Fright Night. One appeal of the series is that viewers got to see what the parties were like inside the Playboy Mansion.

Holly Madison continued to be a star after the show ended

In 2009 The Girls Next Door concluded and several of the women went on to do their own things. Some former viewers have wondered what they have been doing for the past decade. According to Us Weekly Madison landed her own series soon after the show ended.

Madison’s spinoff show was Holly’s World and it focused on her life and career. The show lasted for two seasons with 18 episodes but she has had other television appearances. Madison was a competitor in the eighth season of Dancing With the Stars.

Madison also landed a minor role in CSI: Crime Scene Investigation. Some people saw her performance in a burlesque show in Planet Hollywood’s Peepshow for multiple years. However her career does not only involve performing in front of others.

In 2015 Madison ventured into the world of writing. She published a memoir titled Down the Rabbit Hole and it is about her early life and adventures at the Playboy Mansion. She wrote a second memoir the following year. Currently the star is a mother and has a net worth of $16 million.

Holly Madison was a girlfriend in the series until 2008

In the reality series Madison was one of Hefner’s girlfriends. She served as a Playboy Bunny as well as his romantic partner. She got the opportunity to be on TV since she was one of the most well-known women in the inner circle. Madison participated in many of the special events in the show.

Madison spent plenty of time with Hefner and viewers saw a glamorized version of Playboy test shoots and birthday festivities. Madison appeared to have close relations with the other girlfriends throughout the episodes. However they were not friends in real life.

In 2008 Madison and Hefner’s relationship ended. While the camera focused less on her she returned for the last season due to her contract. Eventually Madison moved out of the mansion.",,,,,,

If you didn’t know semiconductor chips were important before the pandemic you do now.

Also known as “microchips” these little bits of tech form the brains behind new cars phones computers gaming consoles and countless other products we rely on everyday (which are now all abruptly in short supply).

Now IBM and Samsung have unveiled a new microchip design that promises radically faster more efficient chips — and a big upgrade to all of our tech that relies on them.

The challenge: Semiconductor chips contain tiny gates called “transistors” that control the flow of electricity. This is what allows a traditional computer to process information using a binary on/off code. (If a gate’s open that’s a “1.” If it’s closed that’s a “0.”)

To make faster more powerful computers we need microchips with more transistors but to keep the chips well micro we’ve had to keep packing more and more transistors into the same area.

We’re now hitting a wall in the amount of transistors we can pack onto a microchip.

The end of the line: In 1975 semiconductor pioneer Gordon Moore famously predicted that we’d be able to double the number of transistors on microchips every two years and that projection — “Moore’s Law” — proved accurate for decades thanks to heroic efforts by engineers.

We’re now hitting a wall in the amount of transistors we can pack onto a microchip though. Making them smaller is just becoming physically impossible — the ones we have today are so small that 1000 of them laid end-to-end are only the width of a human hair.

“The fact is when they’re talking about building physical entities like semiconductors and transistors you can only go so small” Robert Sutor chief quantum exponent at IBM told Electronic Products.

“Atoms have a certain size and you’re approaching the almost atomic molecular distances at this point” he continued. “You’re limited by that.”

IBM and Samsung have unveiled a new microchip design that promises radically faster more efficient chips.

The idea: IBM and Samsung’s new design stacks transistor components vertically on a microchip with electricity flowing up and down rather than the traditional horizontal design with electricity flowing from side to side.

They call their approach “Vertical-Transport Nanosheet Field Effect Transistor” (VTFET) and they say it could not only allow for more transistors on a microchip but also make the flow of electricity through them more efficient.

https://youtu.be/OF3Zwfu6Ngc

Compared to today’s standard transistor design (called FinFET) devices with VTFET chips would have a “two times improvement in performance or an 85 percent reduction in energy use” according to IBM.

That means batteries could last way longer (or be much smaller) and computers could produce much less waste heat which impacts performance and requires loud fans to keep the system cool.

In other words: smartphone batteries that last a week rather than a day.

“Scaling silicon is not the only way to get lower power and better performance.” Valeria Bertacco

The bigger picture: IBM and Samsung haven’t said when they plan to start producing chips with the stacked transistor design so we don’t know when they might actually start showing up in your phone or watch but it typically takes a few years to go from the drawing board to figuring out how to mass produce chips and building devices capable of using them.

However the stacked design and more densely packed transistors are not the only ways we’re going to keep computer power growing in the decades to come.

“Scaling silicon is not the only way to get lower power and better performance” Valeria Bertacco director of the University of Michigan’s Applications Driving Architectures research center told EE Times in 2019. “It was just the easiest way until 10 years ago.”

Replacing silicon with other materials such as graphene might unleash big upgrades in performance too.

Another way is to specialize microchips for specific tasks and divide the computer’s labor.

“Hardware customized for particular domains can be much more efficient and use far fewer transistors enabling applications to run tens to hundreds of times faster” MIT researcher Tao Schardl told MIT News in 2020.

More efficient software and better algorithms could also allow progress to continue even if transistor numbers don’t keep increasing. Replacing the semiconductor materials such as silicon in microchips with other materials such as graphene might unleash big upgrades in performance too.

Then there’s the ultimate game-changer: quantum computers which aim to do away with transistor-laden microchips entirely. Instead they encode information in entangled particles that can represent 1s 0s or both simultaneously which dramatically increases the computer’s potential processing power.

But today’s silicon microchip electronics aren’t going to be replaced by quantum versions or even graphene any time soon so in the near-term we’ll have to rely on clever new designs to grind out another round of Moore’s Law improvements.

The country that created the show Real Humans and its English language adaptation Humans is also a stronghold of so-called biohackers who are convinced that humans will become evermore entangled with technology in the future.

“I have a chip implant in my arm and I have programmed the chip so that I have my Covid passport on the chip and the reason is that I always want to have it accessible and when I read my chip I just swipe my phone on the chip and then I unlock and it opens up” said Hannes Sjoblad managing director of DSruptive Subdermals as a PDF with his vaccine certificate appeared on his phone.

“A chip implant costs a hundred euros if you want to buy the more advanced versions and you can compare this with for example a health wearable that will cost perhaps twice that but at the same time a chip implant you can use for twenty thirty forty years. Whereas a wearable you can only use for three four years” he added.

For Sjoblad the Covid pass is just one example of a possible application which will be a “thing for the winter of 2021-2022”.

The Swedish entrepreneur added he has a “strong interest in privacy.”

While he acknowledged that many “people see chip implants as a scary technology as a surveillance technology” Sjoblad said that instead they should be viewed as a simple ID tag.

“They don’t have a battery they cannot transmit the signal by themselves so they’re basically asleep they can never tell your location they are only activated when you touch them with your smartphone” he said.

May 17 2022 - Semiconductor Stocks in India? Here's a Watchlist for You to Track...

Semiconductor Stocks in India? Here's a Watchlist for You to Track...

Editor's note: Semiconductor stocks are a hot trend in equity market today.

In December 2021 we were quick enough to identify this megatrend and wrote about the top semiconductor stocks.

A lot has happened since we last wrote to you in December 2021. In this updated article we take you through the recent developments.

Continue reading...

If you're looking for growth stocks semiconductor stocks should be the first place you should look.

Why?

2021 and 2022 were good years for the semiconductor industry as demand surged. However the pandemic caused disruptions which throttled supply.

The demand-supply mismatch resulted in semiconductor stocks seeing a sharp rally and touching their all-time highs.

And here's the thing...

There are not one or two drivers of technological advancements where semiconductor chips are proving their worth.

The transformation of auto sector as we undergo an electric vehicle (EV) revolution.

5G rollout.

Smartphones smart TVs and other electronic items.

These were just a few examples but there are more.

As industries rush towards digitization demand for semiconductors will only grow more.

So if you think the semiconductor theme is just temporary and might be over soon think again.

The government has lined up a host of initiatives for local semiconductor manufacturing. Currently India meets its semiconductor requirements through imports.

The demand-supply mismatch is here to stay and semiconductor stocks will make headlines yet again.

The companies involved in this space directly or indirectly are still very few. This can change very quickly and the right pick could be the x-factor for your portfolio.

Recently we wrote about the top semiconductor companies and why they should be on your watchlist.

This list is still extremely relevant today.

While these stocks have the potential to deliver huge gains you should be very careful about which semiconductor stock to invest in.

There's been another major development since we wrote about semiconductor stocks in December 2021.

Companies have submitted plans for setting up fab units (a technical word for a plant where semiconductors are produced) while many have submitted proposals for designing and packaging semiconductors.

Global semiconductor giants are showing interest to set shop in India and giving India's semiconductor plans a much-needed push.

For instance international semiconductor consortium ISMC will invest a whopping US$3 bn in setting up a semiconductor chip-making plant in Karnataka.

Believe it or not developments in this space are happening at a fast pace.

India's Semiconductor Stocks to watch Out For...

The global shortage of semiconductor chips has triggered concerns as companies around the world fail to meet rising demand for a wide range of essential as well as modern tech products.

The shortage has intensified over the past couple of months.

Semiconductors are components needed for manufacturing cars televisions refrigerators washing machines personal computers laptops mobiles etc.

These components are made from silicon and fit into microcircuits that power various electronic goods and components.

These little chips are so important that tens of thousands of workers must get lines that are a millionth of a meter i.e. one micron wide exactly right. Or else it won't work. The semiconductor chips fail.

Semiconductors play an important role in a variety of fields. For example operating air conditioners improving automobile safety laser treatment in cutting-edge medical care and the list goes on.

While making a list of semiconductor stocks in India there were no surprises. Every stock which had even little exposure to semiconductors has seen a sharp rally.

Why?

The buzz around semiconductors started mainly due to the shortage of semiconductor chips.

Another factor driving semiconductor stocks higher is the Indian government's efforts and support.

The government has announced the PLI scheme for semiconductor industry. This scheme is worth a whopping Rs 760 bn to be invested over the next 5-6 years.

The scheme aims to boost the semiconductor and display manufacturing in India. It will position the country as a global hub for hi-tech production Semiconductor demand in India is most likely to outstrip supply in near future.

As part of the scheme apart from big companies the government will also incentivise startups to design and make semiconductors.

While there are not many companies involved directly in manufacturing semiconductor chips in India there are some indirect plays.

Let's take a look at listed Indian companies engaged in the semiconductor industry.

#1 Tata Elxsi

It was in August this year when the Tata group showcased its ambitious plan to foray into semiconductor manufacturing.

The company's chairman N Chandrasekaran said the group has already pivoted into a number of new businesses like electronics manufacturing 5G network equipment as well as semiconductors.

The Tata group is in talks with at least three state governments in India to invest US$300 m towards a new semiconductor assembly and testing unit. The states are Tamil Nadu Karnataka and Telangana.

The group is also in talks with major international companies including those from Taiwan for its semiconductor chip business.

Tata Elxsi which is a Tata group company is already into the business of semiconductor services that includes artificial intelligence tools and frameworks design solutions and development.

Note that this foray will help the Tata group supply semiconductor chips and other components to Tata Motors and Tata Power apart from other companies across the world.

#2 Dixon Technologies

Dixon Technologies is the biggest manufacturer of LED TVs in India producing TVs for brands like Samsung Panasonic Xiaomi TCL OnePlus and many more. They also manufacture lighting products for companies like Philips Havells Syska Bajaj Wipro Orient and more.

In 2020 the company forayed into information & communications technology (ICT) hardware including laptops desktops tablets and servers and set up a factory in South India.

As chips are quite important for TVs and other electronics which Dixon makes it could set up a chip manufacturing plant in the future.

However the company's CFO said in 2021 that it has no ready plans for now as a chip manufacturing plant is a high capital expenditure investment of US$4-5 m.

To know more about the company check out Dixon Technologies' financial factsheet and latest quarterly results.

#3 ASM Technologies

ASM Technologies provides consulting and product development services in the areas of engineering services and product R&D.

The main clients of ASM Technologies include reputed customers involved in manufacturing of semiconductor equipment and network devices.

As the pace of technological advancement has been very high in these industries the company's clients invest significantly in R&D to stay ahead of competition. This results in recurring revenues for ASM.

ASM Technologies is in the process of expanding its service offerings and has recently forayed into areas of virtual reality (VR) internet of things (IoT) and open edX platform management.

As the company is closely linked to the semiconductor industry its shares have been on a spectacular run this year.

Over 100% gains came in the month of January 2021. In the year gone by shares of the company are up a whopping 600%.

Surprisingly mutual funds FII or DIIs don't hold any stake in the company. In fact as per ASM Technologies' latest shareholding pattern promoters hold majority of the stake.

Update: Recently the company formed a 50:50 joint venture (JV) with Hind High Vacuum (HHV) to undertake design led engineering and manufacturing of tools sub-systems sub-system components and components for the semiconductor and solar industries.

To know more about the company check out ASM Technologies financial factsheet and latest quarterly results.

#4 SPEL Semiconductor

SPEL Semiconductor is engaged in offering electronic integrated circuits (ICs). Its products are used mostly in cell phones computers notebooks and personal digital assistants.

It's facility Natronix is India's first and only semiconductor IC assembly & test facility.

The company's customers are some of the biggest integrated device manufacturers (IDMs) and fabless companies in the US Asia and Europe.

While the company's shares are on a tear this year it has little to offer on the financials front. For the December 2021 quarter the company has posted a loss of Rs 10 m.

This was its sixth consecutive quarter of losses.

Update: When the government invited proposals for semiconductor manufacturing and display plants SPEL Semiconductor registered for semiconductor packaging.

The scheme for establishing semiconductor and display fabs manufacturing facilities was announced last year in December. The first round of applications were invited till 15 February 2022.

#5 Moschip Technologies

Moschip Technologies is a semiconductor and system design company with a focus on turnkey ASICs mixed signal IP semiconductor & product engineering and IoT solutions catering to various industries.

This little-known company has emerged as a leading semiconductor design services company providing various services to clients globally. It has a track record of more than 20 years.

The company has four arms namely Gigacom Semiconductor LLC California USA Gigacom Semiconductor Visakhapatnam FirstPass Semiconductors Hyderabad and Institute of Silicon Systems Hyderabad. Moschip acquired these companies as part of its growth plan to offer the full suite of skillset and expand business geography.

From the lows of Rs 14 touched last year shares of Moschip Technologies surged to Rs 83.55. That's a gain of over 370% in just one year.

After trading in a range shares of the company broke through and gained momentum after the PLI scheme was informed.

Between November 2021 and December 2021 shares of the company gained 85%.

Update: Shares of the company have come under pressure in the past few months amid the broad-based selloff and because of weak quarterly results.

Currently the company continues to focus on semiconductor design semiconductor IP (intellectual properties) and other IoT projects.

#6 Ruttonsha International

This company manufactures semiconductor devices power rectifiers assemblies and semiconductor diodes.

The semiconductor devices which it makes includes diodes rectifiers thyristors among others ranging from 10 amps to 12000 amps with voltage groups ranging from 200 volts to 5000 volts.

In 2005 Ruttonsha International was taken over by Dr Harshad Mehta and Mrs Bhavna H Mehta the promoters of Silicon Power Corporation USA.

Just like other stocks involved in the semiconductor industry shares of Ruttonsha International also saw a spectacular run on the bourses.

Starting 3 December 2021 when the stock was trading at Rs 75 per share it continuously traded in an uptrend and gained over 100% in a month.

Update: The company's one way rally was halted due to the Russia-Ukraine war inflation concerns among other factors which halved the company's stock.

When government invited bids for semiconductor fab units Ruttonsha International registered for making compound semiconductors.

Compound semiconductors are different from silicon ones. While a majority around 80% of the world's semiconductors use silicon the remaining 20% use compound semiconductors.

The company has also acquired 100% stake in Visicon Power Electronics which is in the business of manufacturing silicon carbide (SiC) wafers and power electronic devices through epitaxial process.

This acquisition was done for ease of business operations and widen its product reach across diverse business vertical of semiconductors.

The company has big plans for manufacturing SiC based products in India for which it is setting up a fab unit.

#7 Vedanta

After Tatas the Vedanta group announced to invest a huge sum to make displays and other semiconductor chips in India.

It was announced in December 2021 that the Vedanta group is planning to invest US$20 bn over the next 5-10 years to make displays and other semiconductor chips in India. This investment will be made through Avanstrate Inc. a glass substrate manufacturer in which Vedanta has a controlling stake.

An integrated display fab facility and a separate semiconductor facility will be set up.

Avanstrate is in talks with various states that have experience in electronics including Gujarat Tamil Nadu Maharashtra and Haryana. These states provide incentives over and above the central government's schemes.

Update: Vedanta's investment of US$20 bn is almost double of the Indian government's PLI scheme for semiconductors.

To become India's first chip maker Vedanta is seeking 1000 acres of free land water and power at concessionary and fixed prices among other incentives.

It will form a joint venture (JV) with Taiwan's Foxconn and manufacture semiconductor chips in the 28 nm category.

Vedanta has also proposed setting up a display fab on its own.

Vedanta's core business is mining. But it has ventured into the semiconductor space before.

None of these attempts took off. Vedanta claims it had never shelved these plans and is ready for another go.

It wants to start operations at its display fab by 2024. It also believes its JV with Foxconn can start operations in the chip fab by 2025.

Apart from the above there are few other listed Indian stocks which are directly or indirectly related to the semiconductor industry.

These companies include Solex Energy MIC Electronics Indosolar and Surana Solar.

How India stands to benefit

Note that building a semiconductor ecosystem needs big investments and critical infrastructure to support it. The plants need a continuous supply of electricity and water.

Even a single manufacturing plant can use anything between two and nine gallons of water per day.

It also needs manpower. If we go by estimates the recent PLI scheme could lead to the creation of 35000 jobs apart from one lakh indirect employment opportunities. It could also generate investments to the tune of Rs 17000 bn.

As the chip shortage seems to be far from over and the demand expected to rise India stands to benefit as it has adequate resources water and manpower.

Most emerging technologies have high dependence on semiconductors.

A mobile phone or a consumer appliance or even a vehicle as the pace of innovation increases the use of semiconductors will also increase.

Also in September 2021 India made a deal with Taiwan. This deal allows Taiwan to transfer technology for a chip plant worth an estimated US$7.5 bn in India. These chips would power everything from 5G devices to electric cars.

Meanwhile India will be financing 50% of the chip foundry capex. In addition the facility will enjoy tax breaks and other incentives. This deal is certainly a win-win for both India and Taiwan.

In a recent editorial Co-head of Research at Equitymaster Tanushree Banerjee shared some insights on this topic.

Here's an excerpt...

Currently India imports almost all semiconductors.



Its demand is estimated to reach around US$100 bn by 2025 from about US$24 bn in 2021.



Previous efforts to get companies to invest in the semiconductor space had failed. The complex manufacturing processes requires heavy investments apart from need for supply of uninterrupted clean water and electricity.



India is seen as strong player in chip design. But the companies here have failed to get chip foundries into the country.



The investments in India's semiconductor capacity are expected to grow 4-fold in the next few decades.

Tanushree has identified a tech company in India which is grossly underrated despite its dominant role in semiconductor chip designing.

The company has set up management teams in Taiwan South Korea and Vietnam in recent months seeing the growth potential of this business.

With its disruptive capabilities Tanushree believes the company's future seems far more promising than its past.

A wide variety of interviewees and an honest assessment of the brand's highs and lows make the six-part documentary feel authentic.

""Jeepers"" I thought. ""I want to play Halo Infinite immediately.""

Then I watched the episode covering the Xbox 360's infamous Red Ring of Death a widespread hardware failure that cost Microsoft more than $1 billion to repair. And I remembered how gutted I was when it happened to me.

This doesn't seem like something to celebrate but it feels like Microsoft is doing just that by selling a $25 Red Ring Of Death ""premium print"" to coincide with the new documentary.

I don't know how countless other gamers -- those whose precious time and energy were wasted by the 360 hardware failure -- feel about this but my blood boiled at the idea that Microsoft is making money off this issue. I'm certainly not nostalgic about it and the idea of having a reminder of the one console that failed me isn't appealing in the slightest.

Xbox declined to comment about the prints.

I loved my 360. Playing Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter on Xbox Live and Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion on that console was essential in getting me through my first breakup as a 19-year-old in 2006. I was fixated on in-game achievements playing for long hours to unlock as many as I could. (I'll admit that I was emotionally dependent on my 360.)

It seemed like Microsoft had a loyal fan for life until my 360's front power indicator showed three red lights instead of the four green ones. That day's Marvel Ultimate Alliance session was cut short. A little online investigation revealed that my beloved console was dead. Microsoft started a repair program to sort out the issue. Three or four weeks later (it apparently took much longer in my native Ireland than it did in the US) I had a working gaming machine again.

Unfortunately some of the magic was gone. I kept expecting the problem to happen again and it sure did. And I went another few weeks without a console. Great.

Pretty much everyone I knew who played their 360 extensively suffered through at least one Red Ring – some of CNET colleagues who are passionate gamers recalled having up to five fails. (One did manage to avoid the issue altogether; his 360 was a chosen one.) A 2009 study of console failures found that nearly a quarter of Xbox 360 consoles failed considerably more than its competitors (10% of Sony PlayStation 3 consoles and 2.7% of Nintendo Wii consoles).

The documentary doesn't shy away from this issue and it's clear the people at Xbox felt terrible about it. Microsoft handled what might have been a brand-killing disaster as well as it could have -- by flinging $1.15 billion at the problem and tweaking later models of the console.

""These were the darkest days of my career"" Leo del Castillo part of the Xbox hardware engineering group said in the documentary.

However you feel about the Red Ring debacle now Power On is an engrossing watch. It addresses the disastrous 2013 Xbox One reveal which put so much emphasis on the 360 successor's TV streaming and online capabilities that it alienated a chunk of the Xbox's core gamer audience -- including me. I bought a PlayStation 4 and dismissed that generation's Xbox completely.

Despite this I acknowledge that Xbox did incredible work in revitalizing its brand. Since Phil Spencer became head of Xbox in 2014 it's acquired killer studios like Minecraft maker Mojang and Elder Scrolls developer Bethesda done stellar work reintroducing backward compatibility created an irresistible subscription program in Game Pass launched cloud gaming introduced gaming to a wider audience through the Xbox Adaptive Controller and is giving the PlayStation 5 a run for its money with the Xbox Series X|S.

This is all extremely admirable and most of the documentary makes me feel warm and fuzzy about Xbox. But Microsoft trying to profit off the Red Ring left me with a sour taste and I'm suddenly of two minds about playing Halo Infinite after all.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvbWljcm9zb2Z0LXdpbGwtbm90LXBhcnRpY2lwYXRlLXBoeXNpY2FsbHktY2VzLXRoZS12ZXJnZS0yMDIxLTEyLTI0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Microsoft joins Google Amazon others in canceling in-person presence at CES,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/technology/microsoft-will-not-participate-physically-ces-the-verge-2021-12-24/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvbWljcm9zb2Z0LXdpbGwtbm90LXBhcnRpY2lwYXRlLXBoeXNpY2FsbHktY2VzLXRoZS12ZXJnZS0yMDIxLTEyLTI0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vc2cubmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vZmluYW5jZS9uZXdzL21pY3Jvc29mdC1ub3QtcGFydGljaXBhdGUtcGh5c2ljYWxseS1jZXMtMjMyMzM4NTA4Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Microsoft joins Google Amazon others in canceling in-person presence at CES,"The CES logo is displayed in the lobby of the Las Vegas Convention Center in Las Vegas

(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp said on Friday it will not participate in person at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2022 in Las Vegas joining a list of companies opting not to have a physical presence at next month's event on concerns over the rapid spread of the Omicron COVID-19 variant.

The U.S. software giant added that it will continue to participate at CES remotely according to an emailed statement. The Verge was the first to report on Friday that Microsoft will not participate physically AT CES.

Several other companies including U.S. automaker General Motors Co Alphabet Inc.'s Google and its self-driving auto-technology company Waymo Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc Twitter Inc Lenovo Group AT&T Inc and Amazon.com Inc dropped in-person attendance plans earlier this week.

CES officials on Thursday said the event will still be held in person Jan. 5-8 with ""strong safety measures in place"" which include vaccination requirements masking and availability of COVID-19 tests.

After their early success Livija Dolanc and Sandi Ceško moved into teleshopping otherwise known as direct response television to sell a wider range of products to consumers in Slovenia.

In the three decades since it was founded the company has branched out into a wide range of channels to reach customers. It owns numerous brands that it markets across Central and Eastern Europe.

But Studio Moderna has not forgotten the days when most of its sales came from customers calling a number they saw on TV. As the company embarks on an ambitious digitalization drive CEO Jan Heere has been thinking how similar types of marketing are evolving online and what’s next.

“One element that will be interesting in our digital strategy is the new model of DRTV which we’ve seen growing in China very strongly during the pandemic with live streaming on social media” he says.

Last October Studio Moderna began live streaming in more than 15 countries through Facebook YouTube TikTok and Instagram to reach customers directly. “It enables the customer to engage through social media and drive them to ecommerce which is to me the modern iteration of DRTV” Jan says.

He thinks this new form of direct-to-consumer marketing is set to become an important part of the way many companies relate to customers. It offers prospective buyers greater insights into products and in a more dynamic way than a pre-recorded video or a listing on a website. “The technology will enable them to interact and to shop without losing the feed or the stream that they’re watching” he says.

Specialized platform

That innovation is just one part of the puzzle. Jan has big plans that will require using the company’s rich range of channels to reach new customers. He and his team want to double the size of the company in the next three to five years.

“We see a big opportunity in the region in which we trade and with leveraging our brands” he says. “We have strong brands in the home and living segment but we still see the opportunity to grow market share in the countries where we operate.”

While growing its brands through ecommerce is the priority in its new strategy Studio Moderna will also be looking for opportunities to enable third-party businesses to leverage its platforms.

From an honest and humble perspective I think the first challenge is probably inside the house.

“Let’s put it like this: we’re not going the way of Amazon or Allegro” Jan says. “We’re not making a big multi-product multi-brand proposition; it’s more of a specialized platform around home and living and beauty that will enable us to leverage our own brands. Plus there will be an element of having some outside brands who are not familiar with this region and want to expand here through our platform.”

One challenge Jan faces as he pushes ahead with this expansion into digital is to change the company culture adapting it to new ways of doing things.

“From an honest and humble perspective I think the first challenge is probably inside the house” he says. “I think like for many organizations this digital disruption was already a challenge for traditional retail but throughout the pandemic this has become one that we need to solve very quickly.”

A common misconception that he has noticed is the idea that ecommerce is something that will become dominant in the future rather than something that is already a top priority.

“It happens to me quite often that I speak with people in the organization or in the industry in general and they will say ‘This ecommerce thing is going to be the most important thing for the customer.’ And I tend to answer ‘This was the case in the past. Today it’s already gone even further.’”

Overcoming bottlenecks

Jan feels Studio Moderna is not yet at the forefront of this change but is encouraged by his team’s progress so far and sees the company catching up. “It’s important to enable the organization to understand what’s going on outside and how to unlock more entrepreneurial behavior in the business so we can be agile” he explains.

Among the external challenges Jan has faced are issues with supply chains. Studio Moderna sources some of its brands from East Asia with China being a major supplier. The disruption caused by the pandemic has led to several logistics challenges. Freight prices have risen sharply putting pressure on the company’s margins. In turn Jan has pushed for the business to be even more efficient and is considering a rethink about where the company sources certain products.

Organizing the last mile in an efficient way with the right IT tools to enable the customer to have transparency about what’s going on with their order is fundamental.

There have also been issues with bottlenecks in the supply chains. “One thing we saw during last year’s Black Friday and that heavy period of pre-Christmas trading is that the online logistics providers were saturated” Jan says. “That generated real bottlenecks to get the goods to the consumers in acceptable lead times. Organizing the last mile in an efficient way with the right IT tools to enable the customer to have transparency about what’s going on with their order is fundamental.”

At the same time Jan and his team will continue growing the company’s brands something that they also consider fundamental to being a relevant and specialized platform in the region. Stronger brands will reinforce Studio Moderna’s credibility in the different segments it trades in while encouraging other partners to join the platform.

As these changes come to life the identity of the company is also evolving from its DRTV roots” Jan says. “You have to be careful making comparisons but when I joined the business probably one reference that we could look at was QVC for instance the American DRTV channel. I think that would be instinctively what we were looking at.”

Now the company is looking at platforms like ASOS and Zalando as reference points but it envisions itself also having a strong mix of its own brands.

“We have this know-how about managing brands” he says. “We don’t manufacture but we do all the product development from sourcing to distribution. That’s a specific skill that not all the tech platforms today have. The idea is really to continue to manage the brands in a very curated way to improve that brand experience and to leverage that to drive more traffic to our websites.”

Winners of tomorrow

Studio Moderna has expanded its online presence in other more surprising ways too. It launched a digital fitness platform driven by demand for workout products during the pandemic. “We felt this was a new emerging trend where probably people will not go back to the fitness clubs 100 per cent” Jan says. “There will probably be a trend that will remain of people who have found balance in doing their workout from home with some support or equipment.

“It’s interesting for us because we experimented here on a real native digital project that was born without any other channel and where we really used the influencer community and digital streaming in order to engage with the customer.”

In the early days of ecommerce people would shop online to find products they didn’t have access to through traditional retail channels or else it was promotions that drove much of the traffic to the ecommerce world Jan points out.

The idea is really to continue to manage the brands in a very curated way to improve that brand experience and to leverage that to drive more traffic to our websites.

Today the key motivator is convenience. People generally expect their purchases to arrive very quickly. In Central and Eastern Europe though overall lead times in ecommerce are still relatively slow compared to more well-developed markets. “It’s easy to see five- to seven-day delivery times offered by the different players” Jan says. “People in the Balkans buy from Amazon in Germany and they know that some things will take more than a week or two weeks.”

This presents a big opportunity for Studio Moderna which can adapt to meet the needs of more demanding consumers in the region where it has decades of experience as the markets there become more sophisticated. “Convenience will be a key factor for consumer decisions” Jan says. “I think the companies that are able to prepare their logistics network in order to anticipate this will be the winners of tomorrow.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0a2l0dHNuZXZpc29ic2VydmVyLmNvbS91ay1yZXBvcnQtYm9vc3Rlci1lZmZlY3RpdmVuZXNzLWFnYWluc3Qtb21pY3Jvbi1kZWNyZWFzZXMtd2l0aGluLTEwLXdlZWtzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,UK Report: Booster Effectiveness Against Omicron Decreases Within 10 Weeks,"A United Kingdom Health Security Agency report published on Thursday suggests that the effectiveness of the COVID-19 booster against symptomatic infections of the omicron variant wanes within 10 weeks.

The report included 147597 delta and 68489 omicron cases which were reported between Nov. 27 and Dec. 17. It analyzed the percentage of vaccine effectiveness between reported cases of the two strains in individuals who had received a two-dose regimen of the Astrazeneca Pfizer or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.

Researchers then compared the vaccine effectiveness of those who received a Pfizer or Moderna booster between reported cases of omicron and delta.

In all cases data showed that the vaccines’ effectiveness against omicron was lower compared with their effectiveness against delta. The effectiveness of both the Moderna and Pfizer boosters was also found to decrease within weeks of people receiving the extra dose.

“Among those who received an AstraZeneca primary course vaccine effectiveness was around 60% 2 to 4 weeks after either a Pfizer or Moderna booster then dropped to 35% with a Pfizer booster and 45% with a Moderna booster by 10 weeks after the booster” the report said.

Those percentages were a far cry from the vaccine effectiveness for individuals who had delta.

Vaccine effectiveness was between 80 and 100 percent in the first week for people who received either Pfizer or Moderna booster and had only slightly dipped to just over 80 percent by the 10th week for those with the Pfizer booster.

In the 10th week for individuals who received the Moderna booster and had delta vaccine effectiveness was closer to 100 percent.

Researchers also compared the effectiveness of the Pfizer and Moderna boosters for individuals who received an initial two-dose regimen of the Pfizer vaccine.

“Among those who received a Pfizer primary course vaccine effectiveness was around 70% after a Pfizer booster dropping to 45% after 10-plus weeks and stayed around 70 to 75% after a Moderna booster up to 9 weeks after booster” the report said of that data.

“These results should be interpreted with caution due to the low counts and the possible biases related to the populations with highest exposure to Omicron (including travellers and their close contacts) which cannot fully be accounted for” the report noted.

The report also said “There are insufficient severe cases of Omicron as yet to analyse vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation but this is expected to be better sustained for both primary and booster doses.”

The CEO of Pfizer said earlier this month in an interview with CNBC that it was possible that people would need to receive a fourth dose of the COVID-19 vaccine in light of the omicron variant.",,,,,,,,,

They’ve been steadily adding to their product offering since their inception in 2002 and now offer everything from tube amps to 3D printers. I’ve been one of their customers for 11+ years beginning with the purchase of a 100’ component cable and most recently with a binding post wall plate for my outdoor speakers; not riveting intel but gives you a sense of the diversity of their product line.

More recently they’ve turned their attention to home theater speakers and rather than limp in they’ve attacked this segment of home theater. The subject of this review is essentially a 5.1.4 Atmos capable rig (the .4 coming from Atmos drivers in the towers and surrounds) from their Monolith line: the THX-465T towers THX-365C center channel THX-265B surrounds and 15” THX Ultra Certified 1000-Watt Monolith subwoofer (model 24458).

Monolith THX Certified Speakers

As you can imagine given the nomenclature all of these speakers and the entire Monolith line are THX Ultra Certified. In a nutshell THX Certification helps ensure accuracy wide dispersion (for those sitting in the cheap seats) and the ability to play at high volume without distortion. The 465T towers retail for $999 each (currently on sale for $799) and feature four 6.5” woofers a 2” cloth dome midrange driver and a 1” silk dome tweeter. The Atmos driver on the top of the speaker features a 5.25” pulp cone woofer and a .6” silk dome tweeter. They’re also quite large measuring 55.3” high by 13.1” wide by 16.7” deep and they weigh a stout 55 pounds each. Frequency response measures 29 Hz – 24 kHz vented and 45 Hz – 24 kHz when sealed and sensitivity is rated at 89.5dB. It’s also worth noting that the cabinets in the Monolith line are all HDF (High-Density Fiberboard) not MDF worth mentioning as this provides markedly better damping and is a welcome touch especially at these price points.



The THX-365C center channel retails for $399 (currently on sale for $349) and features two 6.5” pulp cone woofers a 2” silk dome midrange driver and a 1” silk dome tweeter. The 365C measures 9.7” high by 22.9” wide by 10.8” deep and weighs in at 26.4 pounds. Frequency response is 65 Hz – 24 kHz and sensitivity is rated at 89.5dB.

The THX-265B Atmos-enabled surrounds retail for $349 (currently on sale for $269) and feature one 6.5” pulp cone woofer and a 1” silk dome tweeter while the up-firing Atmos speaker features a 5.25” pulp cone driver and a .6” silk dome tweeter. Frequency response is 65 Hz – 24 kHz and sensitivity is rated at 86.0dB. The 265B’s measure 15.4” high by 9.7” inches wide by 10.8” deep and they weigh 21.4 pounds each.



Lastly the Monolith 15” 1000 Watt sub which is an extreme example of their exemplary price to performance ratio (more on that later).

Hang on to your hats as you read these specs both those of form as well as function. The sub retails for a very reasonable (given its performance) $1339 (currently on sale for $1099) and features a 15” driver and 1000-Watt Class D amp. The cone is made of a combination of fiber pulp and fiberglass said to provide greater accuracy output and dynamics. It’s also been designed with 3 ports allowing you the flexibility to run it sealed or unsealed. Frequency response is dependent on whether you run it sealed: 15-200Hz vented (2 ports): 14-200Hz or vented (3 ports): 16-200Hz.

Generally speaking a sealed sub is going to provide tighter more accurate bass while a ported sub will be louder and give you more boom but you’ll lose some accuracy. It couldn’t be a more subjective situation hence Monoprice provides you the option. I prefer a sealed box and kept the sub as such throughout critical listening. As with all other Monolith speakers the cabinet is made of HDF and Monoprice paid particular attention to the internal bracing of the cabinet in order to ensure proper damping.

In past subwoofer reviews I’ve used the term “beast” to describe them; those reviews need to be edited to reflect what now lurks in my theater – a true beast both in terms of girth as well as performance. To put it in perspective my 12-year-old son was too small to help maneuver it and my wife was simply too scared. So in a true Festivus Feat of Strength I wrestled all 128.5 pounds of it downstairs and into position in my theater without help. There would be no experimenting with positioning. Luckily it did fit albeit barely into the subwoofer sweet spot in my theater.

Hookup

I began by connecting the speakers to my Marantz SR7013 receiver using Solstice 8 speaker cables from Wireworld. Assorted source components include my Macbook Pro Arcam irDAC and LG Ultra HD Blu-ray player. The only real wrinkle with connecting a system of this ilk is the fact that given the upward-firing Atmos drivers in the front towers and surrounds a 5.1.4 system. As such each of those speakers needs an extra set of speaker wires. In some systems this is pretty straightforward in my system due to the fact that all of my source components are in another room; it was kind of a bitch. That said regardless of your particular setup there’s a solid chance it’s going to be easier than cutting holes in your ceiling and routing cables to them.

The only other wrinkle I’ll mention is the fact that the tower cabinets don’t ship enclosed rather the base acts as the final piece of the speaker cabinet enclosure. So it’s a bit disconcerting to unbox one of these beasts lay it on its side and realize that there’s an open hole on the bottom of the cabinet. That said once the base is installed they seal quite nicely and not to tip my hand perform admirably. This is likely a cost-saving measure and one for which I have no complaint just thought it worth mentioning. After plenty of hours of the break-in and running my receiver’s auto-calibration it was time to begin critical listening with several Atmos encoded Blu-rays and some Spatial Audio courtesy of Apple Music.

Performance

Out of the gate I wanted to get a sense of how the upward-firing Atmos drivers would compare to my dedicated in-ceiling Atmos setup. I’ll admit having only heard demos (almost always in highly controlled environments) I was skeptical about how they might perform and honestly had never truly considered such a setup for my theater.

So with plenty of preconceived notions for which I’m not proud I fired up my trusty Dolby Atmos demo disc given to me at CES several years ago. I started with this Blu-ray as there are several well-recorded Atmos clips with which I’m very familiar. I’ll say without hyperbole I was truly stunned. Are there differences in the sound of a dedicated down-firing Atmos ceiling speaker vs one that’s firing up and off the ceiling? Of course. Would it bother an untrained ear with the right setup? I doubt it. Case in point – during casual listening sessions neither my wife nor my 12-year-old son noticed any difference in terms of sound quality immersion etc.

Did it make me second-guess my decision to tear up my ceiling tear out some of my hair and spend a shit ton of money on my existing in-ceiling setup? Yes. In other words if you’re on the fence about in-ceiling vs. upward-firing Atmos speakers I can say that unless you’re truly discerning about sound quality and want only the most immersive setup you should strongly consider both propositions.

After ejecting the demo disc it was on to John Wick 3 – Parabellum (Lionsgate). In the beginning of chapter 8 during the gunfight with Keanu and Halle Berry I noted the Monoliths brought forth most of the realism and intensity that I’m used to from my reference system while also keeping their composure through the cacophony. There are plenty of bullet impacts and stabbings in this scene and this is where the sub shone brightly.

As a matter of fact I’d say at least in terms of watching an action film it’s as solid a performer as I’ve had in my listening room. With music wherein you might want more accuracy speed subtlety etc. you can do better but you’re also going to spend a lot more than a grand to get there. But back to the film I did note that while still compelling the upward firing Atmos speakers tend to put off a bit more of a manufactured sound than what you get with dedicated in-ceiling Atmos speakers which is to be expected. That said the Monoliths still provided a compelling sense of realism and especially with the sub made me miss the movie theater a tad less.

Next up in the cue was the Diamond Luxe Edition of Gravity the only Blu-ray release of the film that has an Atmos encoded soundtrack. So rare is this disc that it’s going for $300 on eBay which is more than I’ll make for writing this article but I digress. In the opening scene as NASA communicates with the astronauts the dialogue comes from all around you a true showcase for Atmos and one that will expose a lesser Atmos rig. In this case you’d never know that the Monolith Atmos drivers were firing up and off the ceiling as opposed to hanging up in the air. Also in this and with other films I noted how articulate and transparent the center channel is with dialogue.

As a reminder we’re talking about a center channel that costs $349; transparency is not a term typically associated with sub-$400 centers. The surrounds also shone brightly during this sequence of the film drawing you right into the action with both the effects as well as the dialogue and managing to create and hold all of the tension the filmmakers intended. I kept marveling at the fact that this level of performance can be had for $3600. While not a bargain for many myself included at this level of performance it’s a downright steal.

Moving on to music I played Pink Floyd’s Learning to Fly in Dolby Atmos through Apple Music’s new Spatial Audio offering. It was an interesting mix with the vocals moving back and forth across the front of the soundstage. While the Monoliths did a commendable job in providing solid detail and imaging Spatial Audio in general turned out to be a bit of a mixed bag. It’s highly track-dependent wherein some mixes are compelling and others sound gimmicky and are off-putting. That said it’s certainly worth your time if you have an Atmos capable rig and like to experiment.

As I continued with music I played around with some familiar bass-heavy tracks to see who’d give up first the Monolith or me. I lost. Playing Sunflower by Post Malone I noted that the sub hit the heavy bass notes with taut accurate bass and never lost its composure. I had a similar experience with tracks like Supersonic (My Existence) by Skrillex and The Beastie Boys Multilateral Nuclear Disarmament which while hitting hard is also a good measure of a system’s overall coherence and dynamic range. It was on this track much like with the Gravity demo where I truly fell in love with the Monoliths.

They image well provide a compelling soundstage (on most tracks) and are just plain fun. The sub also provided me with an answer to a question audiophiles have been asking themselves for many moons – is there such a thing as too much sub? The answer is no. Going up in power driver size etc. is commensurate with the level of enjoyment and is one of the most compelling ways to re-create the movie theater environment.

For my last music test I had to throw in a Blu-ray concert and after much deliberation went with my favorite female artist of all time – Stevie Nicks. Her Blu-ray The 24 Karat Gold Tour (BMG) in DTS-HD Master Audio is a true testament to the fact that at least as of 2015 she’s still got it. It was during this demo that I noted the midrange prowess of the Monoliths especially in terms of resolution. I also noted that both vocals and guitars tended to sit toward the rear of the soundstage while backing vocals tended to fill the entirety of the soundstage though possibly due to the recording rather than the speakers.

Any rig has its limitations and it was while listening to this concert that I came back down to earth and noted the lack of transparency and resolution compared to my reference rig albeit at more than twice the price. All that said we can’t talk Stevie without talking vocals and I noted that the Monoliths did a solid job conveying her signature rasp range and vibrato especially on familiar tracks such as Landslide and Rhiannon. I also noted exemplary imaging with the guitar hovering up and to my left and the piano floating all around the listening position.

The Downside

While the subwoofer comes with a decent set of “getting you started” instructions nothing beyond a card directing you to the Monoprice website exists in the other speaker boxes. This might seem like a minor oversight but when you consider the fact that these are Dolby Atmos capable speakers it’s not necessarily going to be obvious to a noob how to properly connect them to a receiver. Further once you follow the link mentioned on the card Monoprice makes no mention of how to connect them to your receiver.

While these are purpose-built speakers it’s worth noting that they are at least with respect to the towers and sub exceedingly large. While this is not a negative per se it’s simply a reminder to do your homework on your theater’s size and what level of performance you’re looking for before ordering.

All of that said sonically speaking which is obviously the most critical component with a set of speakers; I found no critical fault with the Monoliths at least none that would stop me from buying them.

Competition and Comparison

In the interest of trying to keep this as fair as possible let’s consider this particular system’s total current sale price of $3584 since that’s today’s pricing. Typically when writing this section in a review I have a couple of comps that pop right into my head. In this case I’m somewhat loath to admit I had to resort to research. Though to my credit many of the major speaker manufacturers are limping into the Atmos realm as they’ve been waiting to see if this new technology is here to stay. 3D anyone?

Given the proliferation of films being released in Atmos coupled with Apple embracing the technology it’s now a pretty strong bet that it’s here to stay. Anyway there simply isn’t anything out there at least that I’m aware of that delivers this much bang for the buck; they’re sort of the Bayliner of the speaker realm. Anyway after some digging I did come up with a couple of options – one dedicated rig with the Atmos drivers built-in and the other using Atmos add-ons. Anyway without further preamble here are a couple of other options worth a look at. I’ll start with Klipsch as it’s one of the rare brands in which quality and consistency run from their least expensive offerings all the way up to their reference line.

The rub with Klipsch is in trying to navigate their product offering as it’s a mess; too many products and a website in desperate need of an overhaul. That said a comparable Atmos capable Klipsch system would be their R-625FA 5.1.4 Dolby Atmos Home Theater System. While you’ll save some money with the Klipsch system you’ll also lose out markedly on bass as this system is paired with an anemic (compared to the Monolith) sub featuring a 12” driver and 400-Watt amp. If you want a Klipsch subwoofer comparable to the Monolith you’ll want to look at the THX-1200-SW but that’s also going to cost you roughly $500 more and drop you from a 15” driver down to a 12”. On the upside that also translates to a smaller cabinet that’s almost 50 pounds lighter than the Monolith. Another option for those who might not be aware is Dolby Atmos add-on speakers. These are designed to sit atop an existing tower or surround and basically make them Atmos capable. There are a host of manufacturers offering them – Klipsch Monitor Audio ELAC etc. If your budget doesn’t allow for a dedicated Atmos rig upgrading your current system is worth considering especially if you want to test the water before doing a deep Atmos dive.

Conclusion

This is by far the longest review I’ve ever written... though we’ll see what happens once my editor gets ahold of it. The reason? I had a blast with the Monoliths and truly enjoyed what I was hearing. Monoprice offers a 5-year replacement warranty and a 30-day money-back guarantee both critical components when selling direct to consumers. Monoprice is a company (unlike say Elite Screens) that strives to put the customer first. As such if you place an order and decide after setup that you want more bass or maybe want to go smaller on your front towers just reach out and they’ll be happy to help.

Monoprice is a rare company especially in 2021 that is willing to put the customer first. While Monoprice has priced their speakers aggressively putting together a high-performance Atmos system is still costly. So do your research then create your own real-world demo in your own home but do it with the right company which is to say one that not only makes a solid product but does their utmost to ensure their customers are able to enjoy it.

They’re on sale and it’s the holiday season – a great time to get off the fence get into Dolby Atmos and do it right. Monoprice touts their Monolith line as “the best value in high-end audio” - they’re making one hell of a case.

Bankers with lots of money say it doesn ...,"2021 has not been a normal year. One final piece of evidence for its abnormality is that the standard seasonality of the banking recruitment market seems to have been upended. Headhunters are saying that they’re seeing as much as three times the usual level of activity in the fourth quarter. Since few investment bankers are going to be looking around in December this year in anticipation of a disappointing bonus round that means that there are firms out there who are prepared to buy out the entire 2021 compensation package effectively paying up for work they never benefited from. And according to Kevin Mahoney at Bay Street Advisors they’re paying a premium to do so – MD bonuses are being seen up 20-30% across the industry but some banks are prepared to pay total compensation increases of as much as 50% in the hottest sectors like tech and healthcare.

Not only that but clients are increasingly asking for “lift-out” deals. This is where you hire a senior MD and simultaneously make offers to all of his or her direct reports. Banks are often a bit nervous about doing this sort of thing – it makes your competition very angry and there can be some tricky legal issues raised if it is too obvious that you’ve been coordinating the move.

But for heads of investment banking who started the year in a cautious frame of mind and are now playing catch-up not being adequately staffed right now is unthinkable. The pipeline of deals for January looks just as strong as it did in 2021 and every month of 2022 that you’re understaffed will be one full of missed revenue opportunities. It seems that heads of department are rationalizing their December hiring strategies to themselves by presuming that even if they’re paying slightly over the odds they ought to make it back in revenue terms.

That could be a risky move of course. Anyone making an offer today will be doing incredibly well to get things closed by the year-end. And given that the vast majority of MDs will need to take three months’ gardening leave that means that your new expensive hire will be walking through the door at the end of March. With the time needed to give everyone their new phone number get new pitch books produced and so on a new rainmaker will be aiming to generate revenue in whatever market conditions prevail at the end of April – potentially mid-May.

This matters if you're a banker because the other difference from previous hiring cycles is that there seems to be much less use of multi-year guarantees. This means that the end-year hires are not quite as expensive as they look because although there’s an upfront signing-on bonus there’s no commitment for 2022 (beyond a degree of unenforceable “indication”) and certainly not for 2023. Anyone taking one of these big offers would be well advised to line up a few quick wins to impress the new boss as early as possible.

Elsewhere Spear’s the magazine for really rich people ends the year in philosophical mood asking “what does it all mean”? Of course it’s better to be rich than poor if only for financial reasons but once you’ve become an ultra-high-net-worth individual do you have to do some good with it if you want people to respect you? The answer appears to be yes.

Many of the people giving the message of philanthropy are super-successful bankers like John Studzinski and Guy Hands. But Morris Pearl former BlackRock MD gives an entire life cycle of what it’s like to feel rich. When you’re very young it means being able to buy a sandwich from the posh deli. A bit later on it’s owning a nice commuter house. Once you’ve had kids wealth means being able to tell them that they don’t need to worry about paying for college. And then finally (we think a few interim stages might have been skipped) you start feeling truly wealthy when you’ve got so many philanthropic activities going on that you need to hire a staff to manage them. What’s actually most interesting is that none of the people interviewed seemed to use the traditional banker’s measure of what it means to be rich; having that crucial bit more than the person on the desk opposite you.

This is our last Morning Coffee until January 4th. Wishing you all a happy healthy Christmas and a prosperous New Year. See you in 2022!

A look at the day ahead from Sujata Rao

How many of the investment calls made a year ago did what they promised? As is usual in any year some asset classes stubbornly refused to do as they were told.

Take the dollar. At this time last year shorting the dollar was the most ""crowded"" trade BofA said citing its monthly fund manager survey. Some have pointed out in the past how his particular poll has acted as a contrarian indicator but this one has been particularly spectacular; the dollar index is up 7% this year. No central bank can ""out-dove"" the Fed we were told but of course plenty managed it.

The other one that went wrong was emerging markets; expecting a rebound in trade tourism and commodity prices alongside dollar weakness Morgan Stanley a year ago told clients ""Gotta Buy EM All!""

Hopefully they didn't. Emerging currency debt has lost 9% and equities are down 6%. Those index moves of course contain some gems (look at 20% gains for Indian shares and a 15% rise for frontier market equities) but also unfortunately... some Turkeys.

Even after some unorthodox measures by the administration to repair the damage the lira remains down some 50%-plus on the year.

The commodity and oil bet has worked however as has U.S. tech the gift which kept giving -- for all the threats of more fines for monopolistic behaviour higher taxes and challenges from smaller tech firms the U.S. Nasdaq index rose 26%.

And makers of semiconductors -- dubbed the new oil by some -- are up 40% not too far behind Brent's 45% rebound.

The Chinese yuan is having a greater impact on its emerging-market counterparts than ever before and may play a crucial role in determining their performance in the coming year.The currency's correlation with an MSCI index of its developing-nation peers rose to record in September on a weekly basis before edging back slightly amid the omicron outbreak Bloomberg data show. While the close relationship is partly a result of China's large weighting it's also been driven by the yuan's links to the Brazilian real reaching the strongest since at least 2008 and that with India's rupee touching a three-year high.The yuan's rising global influence is yet another sign of China's deepening connections across the world economy. Investors are increasingly being drawn to its bonds as an alternative to U.S. Treasuries while some banks are calling for the yuan to join the dollar euro and yen as a global reserve currency. Yet with China's potential being offset by murky policy making and regulatory crackdowns being tied too closely to the yuan may also backfire.""China is going to be a very important element of emerging-market stability and the growth picture"" said Magdalena Polan principal economist at PGIM Ltd. in London. ""The willingness for Chinese policy makers to stabilize growth will be very important to the outlook for Latam and Asia and South Africa as countries there still rely quite a lot on exports from China.""The correlation between the yuan and its peers in the MSCI Emerging-Markets Currency Index climbed to 0.81 in September on a weekly basis from as low as 0.24 at the end of 2010 according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It was at 0.72 on Thursday. A reading of 1 would mean the assets moved in lockstep. That has traders of both emerging-market and G-10 currencies looking to the yuan for clues on where other pairs are headed.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlzcmFlbGhheW9tLmNvbS8yMDIxLzEyLzI0LzIwMjEtc2Vlcy05LXllYXItaGlnaC1pbi10ZWwtYXZpdi1zdG9jay1leGNoYW5nZS1saXN0aW5ncy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2021 sees 9-year high in Tel Aviv Stock Exchange listings,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.israelhayom.com/2021/12/24/2021-sees-9-year-high-in-tel-aviv-stock-exchange-listings/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlzcmFlbGhheW9tLmNvbS8yMDIxLzEyLzI0LzIwMjEtc2Vlcy05LXllYXItaGlnaC1pbi10ZWwtYXZpdi1zdG9jay1leGNoYW5nZS1saXN0aW5ncy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vbS5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmNvbS9tYXJrZXRzL3N0b2Nrcy9uZXdzL2luZGljZXMtZ2Fpbi1mb3ItM3JkLWRheS1uaWZ0eS1yZWNsYWltcy0xNzAwMC9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy84ODQ2NDAwOS5jbXPSAXpodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vbWFya2V0cy9zdG9ja3MvbmV3cy9pbmRpY2VzLWdhaW4tZm9yLTNyZC1kYXktbmlmdHktcmVjbGFpbXMtMTcwMDAvYW1wX2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzg4NDY0MDA5LmNtcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Indices gain for 3rd day Nifty reclaims 17000,"







Mumbai: Indian stock indices extended gains for the third straight day on Thursday brushing aside growing worries about the spread of Omicron in Europe. The Nifty managed to scale 17000 but the scope for sharp upsides appears limited unless investors are convinced that the potential impact of the new Covid-19 variant is less harmful than the previous one.The BSE Sensex rose 384.72 points or 0.68% to close at 57315.28. The NSE Nifty gained 117.15 points or 0.69% to end at 17072.60. The MSCI index for Asia Pacific stocks excluding Japan advanced 0.6% while the Euro Stoxx 600 index gained 1%. Analysts said investors are still assessing the effects of the coronavirus variant as its exact impact is not yet known.While governments and the World Health Organization (WHO) have warned that Omicron could spread faster than the Delta variant two independent studies showed lower chances of hospitalisation for a patient infected by Omicron. Research by London's Imperial College said the risk of needing to stay in hospital for people with Omicron is 40-45% lower than for patients with the Delta variant according to Reuters. A South African study on the same day showed people diagnosed with Omicron in that country between October 1 and November 30 were 80% less likely to be admitted to hospital than those diagnosed with another variant in the same period.""What the market has focused on in the last two days is that Omicron may not be as bad as feared. Even though the cases are rising the number of hospitalisations is not high"" said Andrew Holland CEO Avendus Capital Alternate Strategies. ""We are seeing a short-term bounce. Other factors such as global policy tightening have not changed.""The Sensex and Nifty have gained almost 2.8% in the past three days rebounding from the sharp slump on Monday that was driven by concerns over the spread of Omicron and developed economy central banks starting the process of shutting the liquidity tap. Analysts said the Nifty could face hurdles at 17200-17250 levels. But traders do not foresee the risks of a sharp fall immediately with the Volatility Index or VIX - a fear gauge - extending its declines. The VIX fell 4.6% to close at 15.83 on Thursday.Brokers said if foreign selling recedes on account of the holiday season in developed markets the market could drift higher with inflows from domestic institutional investors still intact. On Thursday foreign portfolio investors net sold shares worth ₹271.59 crore while their domestic peers were buyers to the tune of ₹1196.48 crore.The broader market continued its outperformance with the NSE mid-cap 100 index gaining 0.9% and the small-cap 100 jumping 1.3%.",,,,,,

In it Queen Margaret of Montenaro and Princess Stacy of Belgravia (Vanessa Hudgens and Vanessa Hudgens respectively) must prevent an intentional incident after they lose a priceless relic that is on loan from the Vatican. The film is the latest offering in the fiercely rendered Princess Switch series which has previously tackled abdications coronations and the gritty rivalries of royal life.

Some say the Princess Switch films—and other royalty-based Christmas movies peddled by Netflix—are silly lighthearted comedies designed to inspire goodwill and cheer not overzealous analysis. “Some” are wrong. Netflix has now conjured up so many monarchies that it is about time they were properly indexed: How democratic are these nations? How fascistic are their royal families? How wedded are they to the idea of human rights? Below is a ranking of all of the fictional principalities thus far created by Netflix listed in order of just how much their citizens need to invest in a guillotine (or to put it another way ranked from least to most democratic).

Aldovia

Aldovia is a mountainous central European nation situated to the south of Belgravia; its main export is wooden Christmas decorations. The kingdom is most prominently featured in Netflix’s Christmas Prince trilogy which follows the interpersonal drama of the royal family the Charltons.

While at first glance a free press flourishes in Aldovia—with journalists vocally critical of the monarchy during a media conference in the first film—we later see the color drain from a reporter’s face as Princess Emily Charlton threatens to throw him in the palace dungeons if he doesn’t leave the country immediately. At the end of the second film elderly palace adviser Lord Leopold Plumtree is detained in these very same dungeons after he is accused of corruption—he is never granted a trial.

In the third film viewers see that Leopold was incarcerated long enough to scratch “Leopold was here” in his cell’s mossy dripping rock. The Aldovian palace’s dungeons have no natural light electricity or central heating and they are visibly filthy; Leopold’s imprisonment is a clear violation of Section 1 Articles 3 5 and 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights.

Thankfully Aldovian citizens do have the right to protest—but boy do they have a lot to protest about. While Aldovia initially appears not to be a principality with the first film introducing us to a prime minister the sequel reveals that this role is largely ceremonial (if not an outright sham). It is the King of Aldovia himself who dictates the country’s economic policy and he does this so badly that the entire nation goes on strike over unpaid wages. Rather than figure out how to get the workers paid the Charltons (or should that be charlatans?!) plan an elaborate play go sledding and bake. Let them eat gingerbread indeed.

When one Aldovian worker sends a Christmas card to the queen reading in part “I’ve lost my job as the company I’ve worked for my whole life was put out of business by your ‘New Aldovia’ disaster” the gathered royals do nothing about their failed policies and simply hang the card with other festive well-wishes on the high cornices of their gilded hall.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMS9zdHJlYW1pbmcvbmV3cy9hcmFueWFrLW5ldGZsaXgtaW5kaWEtMTIzNTE0MjA2NC_SAU1odHRwczovL3ZhcmlldHkuY29tLzIwMjEvc3RyZWFtaW5nL25ld3MvYXJhbnlhay1uZXRmbGl4LWluZGlhLTEyMzUxNDIwNjQvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Aranyak’ Team Unpacks the Nordic Noir From India That is a Global Hit for Netflix (EXCLUSIVE),"“Aranyak” the Indian noir series that began streaming Dec. 10 has emerged as a global hit for Netflix. It bowed at No. 1 in India and Bangladesh and is in the top 10 in 13 countries including Bahrain U.A.E. Singapore and New Zealand.

The contemporary series is set in the fictitious forest-surrounded town of Sirona in the Himalayan foothills. The protagonists are Kasturi Dogra a police officer wife and mother who is planning to take a year’s leave of absence in order to devote more time to her family and her marriage which is on the rocks; her replacement Angad Malik who has painful baggage from his past; and her father-in-law Mahadev Dogra a retired member of the Sirona police force.

In keeping with the tropes of Scandinavian noir in “Aranyak” a young French tourist goes missing in Sirona. The clue to her whereabouts maybe a supernatural figure known by the locals as ‘man-leopard.’ But it could also be rival politicians or some of the town’s youngsters or tradespeople all of whom have multiple skeletons in their cupboards.

However the similarities to Scandinavian noir end there. “Aranyak” (which translates to English as ‘the forest’) is deeply rooted in Indian culture and tradition. The series is created by Charudutt Acharya a Film and Television Institute of India direction graduate who also holds a masters degree in feature film screenwriting from Royal Holloway University of London. Acharya’s writing credits include Sony TV’s dramatized crime series “Crime Patrol” and SonyLIV crime drama series “Project 9191.”

Popular on Variety

Acharya got the idea for a series based around a policewoman when on vacation in the Himalayan foothill state of Himachal Pradesh. The writer and and his wife were victims of a petty crime went to report it at a quaint police station and came across a woman who was the mother of a teenage girl wife and police officer and was managing all three functions simultaneously and effortlessly. Acharya who had been toying with the idea of a series based on one of the real life cases he came across on “Crime Patrol” combined it with another thought about a creature-based story and the policewoman character.

“While it is a crime thriller and a whodunit and has a bit of a mythological involvement I was very drawn to the fact that the characters and world we create should be rooted in our ethos” Acharya told Variety adding that a lot of his writing is based on his personal experiences and what he grew up with.

“If you do it correctly then it does become universal” said Acharya who is represented internationally by London-based Blake Friedmann Literary Agency and in India by Collective Artists Network. “We did not make it so subculture specific that somebody might not get it.”

Acharya took his idea to Rohan Sippy for whom he’d previously written “Dum Maaro Dum” (2011) and “Nautanki Saala” (2013) an adaptation of 2003 French comedy film “Après Vous” and who had produced Acharya’s directorial debut “Sonali Cable” (2014). “That balance between the personal drama plot and the thriller element of the whodunit plays out really nicely in this format” Sippy told Variety.

Sippy and Acharya developed the idea and took it to prolific producer Siddharth Roy Kapur who warmed to it instantly and a Netflix commission followed.

“What really drew me to was it was so uniquely Indian it felt authentic. It felt local while still maybe harkening to that Nordic noir space but it also wasn’t derivative” Roy Kapur told Variety.

“Aranyak” is produced by Roy Kapur Films and Ramesh Sippy Entertainment with Rohan Sippy serving as showrunner. Vinay Waikul whose credits include ALTBalaji series “The Test Case” (2018) and “Mission Over Mars” (2019) was brought in to direct. Raveena Tandon one of the biggest Bollywood stars of the 1990s and best actress winner at India’s National Film Awards for “Daman” (2000) was cast as Kasturi Dogra.

“Kasturi’s character is what drew me in – she is such a fierce aspirational lady” Tandon told Variety. “It was my intention to play a woman in uniform someday as I have tremendous respect for them. The way they juggle their personal and professional lives the sacrifices they make for their families and their country and all with a smile on their face.”

Parambrata Chattopadhyay star of both Bengali-language cinema (“Abhijaan”) and Bollywood (“Kahaani”) was cast as Angad Malik. “I truly felt that it was a very taut and atmospheric thriller where I was getting to play a very nuanced character” Chattopadhyay tells Variety.

The plan was to shoot in Manali and Dalhousie from May 2020 but India was in the throes of the first wave of the pandemic and all the development work was forced online.

“There are two or three ways of workshopping one can be a very psychoanalytic approach which I had done with some other films which really helps” says Chattopadhyay. “But with this one what we did was we kept reading and reading and reading time and again and with every single read newer dimensions new nuances came out and finally we could just nail those nuances and emboss them upon ourselves.”

The shoot was delayed till October 2020 and was completed before the next wave struck. Sippy recalls the strict social distancing measures that ruled out post-work socializing while Roy Kapur says that the abundant precautions the production took meant that the shoot wasn’t disrupted by COVID-19 at all. Waikul says that he stayed true to the written material which “inspired us to create visuals for the story.”

“Aranyak” captures the ethos of small town India and the menace of the forest with the majestic Himalayas as the backdrop. It is a win for Netflix in that within India where it has slashed subscription rates it has appealed to a broad audience spectrum one of the streamer’s goals.

“In our conversations with Netflix the idea was to have as wide an audience as possible watch it” says Roy Kapur. “The intention at every point was to see how much we could broaden the scope of the audience and not be intimidated in any way with the style of storytelling or with the manner in which things unfolded. So it is one of those unique pieces of material that appeals to so-called class audience as well as a mass audience.”

The cast also includes Ashutosh Rana Zakir Hussain Indraneil Sengupta and Meghna Malik.

Tanya Bami series head Netflix India said: “We are so heartened and excited to see our members loving the complex characters in ‘Aranyak.’ And there’s a lot to love – a tight plot written by Charudutt Acharya which Vinay Waikul brought to life with his vision and Raveena Parambrata Ashutosh Meghna and Zakir brought in their best to the characters.”

When the complete Twilight film collection exits Netflix on Saturday Jan. 15 they will quickly be making their way to Peacock which will be their exclusive new streaming home beginning on Sunday Jan. 16.

Based on author n Stephenie Meyer's book series of the same name Twilight fever began in 2008 with the release of Twilight the first installment in what would become a five-film franchise. The franchise centers on the love story of Bella and Edward. After relocating from Arizona to Forks Washington Bella's life is turned upside down when she meets Edward whom she soon discovers is a vampire. The two quickly fall in love but their relationship faces challenges not only from other supernatural forces but also from a love triangle including Jacob Black. In addition to the original 2008 film the franchise includes four other titles – The Twilight Saga: New Moon (2009) The Twilight Saga: Eclipse (2010) The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 1 (2011) and The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 2 (2012). The series is lead by Kristen Stewart Robert Pattinson and Taylor Lautner with Peter Facinelli Elizabeth Reaser Ashley Greene Jackson Rathbone Nikki Reed and Kellan Lutz also starring.

Elina Svitolina wants to make one thing clear before her exhausting 27-hour trip on Monday from Switzerland to Adelaide via Sydney.

No-one followed up on the Ukrainian tennis star’s initial specticism about the Covid-19 vaccine meaning there were no reports about her being fully vaccinated way back in June.

The Victorian Government and Australian Open’s vaccine mandate remains a hot topic as the tennis summer prepares to start next week – but it’s no issue for 15th-ranked Svitolina.

“Even if they tell me that I have to get a third shot I would be happy to do that because I see now so many new cases – and lots of players” Svitolina told News Corp.

“Lots of our friends are getting Covid so it’s quite tough right now.”

Svitolina and her husband French tennis player and former world No.6 Gael Monfils plan to be in South Australia for two tournaments each and will be the top seed in three of the four combined.

Free of the quad injury that halted her bid to reach the WTA Finals for a fourth time the 27-year-old is keen to test where she’s at against a bumper field that includes Ash Barty and eight of the top 10.

It will be the fun-loving Svitolina’s first trip to Adelaide but Monfils is familiar with the city after previously being coached by South Australian Roger Rasheed.

“It’s amazing to see so many good players signing to play from the beginning of the season” she said.

“Everyone’s trying to be ready for the first (grand slam) tournament for Melbourne so it’s a really good field and it’s going to be really tough from the beginning of the tournament.

“There’s no time for adjustments – you have to be ready from the first round mentally physically so this is very exciting I think for the tournament and for players as well.”

Svitolina who broke into the top 10 in 2017 and kept her spot until October this year made the US Open quarter-finals won a title in Chicago and earned a singles bronze medal at the Tokyo Olympics.

That Olympic medal was Ukraine’s first in tennis so it had no competition as her on-court highlight for 2021 but her Swiss wedding in July topped everything else.

“It was a very special moment for me and Gael” Svitolina said.

“That month was very busy for both of us. We had our wedding and the next day we had to fly to Tokyo straightaway so no big celebrations but in the end it was very special.

“We shared this moment with our family and our close friends. It was a really small wedding and it was super special … definitely this moment will last forever in our memories.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlYWxlc3RhdGUuY29tLmF1L25ld3MvaW50ZXJpb3ItZGVzaWduZXIta2VlbGV5LWdyZWVucy10b3AtdGlwcy10by1ib29zdC10aGUtdmFsdWUtb2YteW91ci1ob21lL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Interior designer Keeley Green's top tips to boost the value of your home - realestate.com.au,"It can be hard to stand out in a busy property market and make a first impression that counts – and invites multiple offers.

But if a full-blown renovation is off the cards there are some relatively easy and inexpensive ways you can add value and increase buyer demand according to Brisbane-based interior designer Keeley Green of Keeley Green Design.

“Buyers want to walk into a place that feels like home from the moment they do that first inspection” Ms Green said.

“There are plenty of small and inexpensive changes owners can do which will transform their once tired property and make it an attractive proposition for even the most discerning buyer.”

Address obvious wear and tear

Cast a critical eye over your home and make a list of any obvious signs of wear and tear. Repainting the walls in a light bright colour can immediately transform a space.

“Most buyers are focused on kitchens as they are the real heart of the home” Ms Green said.

“Replacing old taps and handles on the cupboards and even cupboard fronts can make a big difference.

“Replace knobs with a more modern and stylish option. It can completely change the look and feel of a kitchen bathroom or laundry.”

Let there be light

Ms Green said light could be transformative.

“Updating light fittings can be an inexpensive way to give a modern touch to a home” she said.

“At the very least you should be taking down old light fittings and cleaning them out remove old dead insects and all the layers of dust which have accumulated there.

“Consider replacing low hanging lights with modern downlighting or adding a sleek feature light in a living area.”

Window treatments which allow more light into a room can also make a room immediately feel more inviting and spacious and contemporary she said.

Consider layering hard window treatments like plantation shutters with soft curtains. It can add a genuine design element to a room without breaking the bank.

Create a Zoom Room

With so many people now working from home a home office is a big-ticket item for many buyers.

“Look around your home and see if there is an opportunity to set up an area as a home office whether it is a spare bedroom or a study nook” Ms Green said.

“Make sure it is clutter free so that buyers can picture themselves sitting there and working from home.

“Add a warm tone lamp for a bit of extra lighting and don’t forget the greenery.”

Freshen up the furnishings

Obviously the furniture isn’t going to be sold with the property but old furniture will make a room feel old Ms Green warned.

“Remove outdated worn and damaged furniture and replace it with some short-term hire pieces” she said.

“It is important to select pieces that make an impact and show a buyer the versatility of a space without dominating the entire room.”

Style style style

“If you’ve watched any lifestyle program in the past five years you’ll know that a beautifully styled home will sell faster often for a higher price” Ms Green said.

“It’s essential that you clear out your clutter add some beautiful cushions and soft throw rugs. Buy new bed linen and add a bit of greenery.

“These are all inexpensive ways to bring a room to life and add a homely personal touch.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzLmNvbS5hdS9zcG9ydC90ZW5uaXMvYXVzdHJhbGlhbi1vcGVuLTIwMjItYW5keS1tdXJyYXktZ3JhbnRlZC13aWxkY2FyZC1hdC1tZWxib3VybmUtcGFyay9uZXdzLXN0b3J5L2FiYTI5YjZkMDMzOGJjN2UwY2FjZGI0NzYwYWVjZDE50gGYAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3MuY29tLmF1L3Nwb3J0L3Rlbm5pcy9hdXN0cmFsaWFuLW9wZW4tMjAyMi1hbmR5LW11cnJheS1ncmFudGVkLXdpbGRjYXJkLWF0LW1lbGJvdXJuZS1wYXJrL25ld3Mtc3RvcnkvYWJhMjliNmQwMzM4YmM3ZTBjYWNkYjQ3NjBhZWNkMTk_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Star backflips on vaccine and will play Adelaide Melbourne,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.news.com.au/sport/tennis/australian-open-2022-andy-murray-granted-wildcard-at-melbourne-park/news-story/aba29b6d0338bc7e0cacdb4760aecd19 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzLmNvbS5hdS9zcG9ydC90ZW5uaXMvYXVzdHJhbGlhbi1vcGVuLTIwMjItYW5keS1tdXJyYXktZ3JhbnRlZC13aWxkY2FyZC1hdC1tZWxib3VybmUtcGFyay9uZXdzLXN0b3J5L2FiYTI5YjZkMDMzOGJjN2UwY2FjZGI0NzYwYWVjZDE50gGYAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3MuY29tLmF1L3Nwb3J0L3Rlbm5pcy9hdXN0cmFsaWFuLW9wZW4tMjAyMi1hbmR5LW11cnJheS1ncmFudGVkLXdpbGRjYXJkLWF0LW1lbGJvdXJuZS1wYXJrL25ld3Mtc3RvcnkvYWJhMjliNmQwMzM4YmM3ZTBjYWNkYjQ3NjBhZWNkMTk_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

“Everyone’s trying to be ready for the first (grand slam) tournament for Melbourne so it’s a really good field and it’s going to be really tough from the beginning of the tournament.

“There’s no time for adjustments – you have to be ready from the first round mentally physically so this is very exciting I think for the tournament and for players as well.”

Svitolina who broke into the top 10 in 2017 and kept her spot until October this year made the US Open quarter-finals won a title in Chicago and earned a singles bronze medal at the Tokyo Olympics.

That Olympic medal was Ukraine’s first in tennis so it had no competition as her on-court highlight for 2021 but her Swiss wedding in July topped everything else.

“It was a very special moment for me and Gael” Svitolina said.

“That month was very busy for both of us. We had our wedding and the next day we had to fly to Tokyo straightaway so no big celebrations but in the end it was very special.

“We shared this moment with our family and our close friends. It was a really small wedding and it was super special … definitely this moment will last forever in our memories.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlYWxlc3RhdGUuY29tLmF1L25ld3MvaW50ZXJpb3ItZGVzaWduZXIta2VlbGV5LWdyZWVucy10b3AtdGlwcy10by1ib29zdC10aGUtdmFsdWUtb2YteW91ci1ob21lL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Interior designer Keeley Green's top tips to boost the value of your home - realestate.com.au,"It can be hard to stand out in a busy property market and make a first impression that counts – and invites multiple offers.

But if a full-blown renovation is off the cards there are some relatively easy and inexpensive ways you can add value and increase buyer demand according to Brisbane-based interior designer Keeley Green of Keeley Green Design.

“Buyers want to walk into a place that feels like home from the moment they do that first inspection” Ms Green said.

“There are plenty of small and inexpensive changes owners can do which will transform their once tired property and make it an attractive proposition for even the most discerning buyer.”

Address obvious wear and tear

Cast a critical eye over your home and make a list of any obvious signs of wear and tear. Repainting the walls in a light bright colour can immediately transform a space.

“Most buyers are focused on kitchens as they are the real heart of the home” Ms Green said.

“Replacing old taps and handles on the cupboards and even cupboard fronts can make a big difference.

“Replace knobs with a more modern and stylish option. It can completely change the look and feel of a kitchen bathroom or laundry.”

Let there be light

Ms Green said light could be transformative.

“Updating light fittings can be an inexpensive way to give a modern touch to a home” she said.

“At the very least you should be taking down old light fittings and cleaning them out remove old dead insects and all the layers of dust which have accumulated there.

“Consider replacing low hanging lights with modern downlighting or adding a sleek feature light in a living area.”

Window treatments which allow more light into a room can also make a room immediately feel more inviting and spacious and contemporary she said.

Consider layering hard window treatments like plantation shutters with soft curtains. It can add a genuine design element to a room without breaking the bank.

Create a Zoom Room

With so many people now working from home a home office is a big-ticket item for many buyers.

“Look around your home and see if there is an opportunity to set up an area as a home office whether it is a spare bedroom or a study nook” Ms Green said.

“Make sure it is clutter free so that buyers can picture themselves sitting there and working from home.

“Add a warm tone lamp for a bit of extra lighting and don’t forget the greenery.”

Freshen up the furnishings

Obviously the furniture isn’t going to be sold with the property but old furniture will make a room feel old Ms Green warned.

“Remove outdated worn and damaged furniture and replace it with some short-term hire pieces” she said.

“It is important to select pieces that make an impact and show a buyer the versatility of a space without dominating the entire room.”

Style style style

“If you’ve watched any lifestyle program in the past five years you’ll know that a beautifully styled home will sell faster often for a higher price” Ms Green said.

“It’s essential that you clear out your clutter add some beautiful cushions and soft throw rugs. Buy new bed linen and add a bit of greenery.

“These are all inexpensive ways to bring a room to life and add a homely personal touch.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzLmNvbS5hdS9zcG9ydC90ZW5uaXMvYXVzdHJhbGlhbi1vcGVuLTIwMjItYW5keS1tdXJyYXktZ3JhbnRlZC13aWxkY2FyZC1hdC1tZWxib3VybmUtcGFyay9uZXdzLXN0b3J5L2FiYTI5YjZkMDMzOGJjN2UwY2FjZGI0NzYwYWVjZDE50gGYAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3MuY29tLmF1L3Nwb3J0L3Rlbm5pcy9hdXN0cmFsaWFuLW9wZW4tMjAyMi1hbmR5LW11cnJheS1ncmFudGVkLXdpbGRjYXJkLWF0LW1lbGJvdXJuZS1wYXJrL25ld3Mtc3RvcnkvYWJhMjliNmQwMzM4YmM3ZTBjYWNkYjQ3NjBhZWNkMTk_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Star backflips on vaccine and will play Adelaide Melbourne,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.news.com.au/sport/tennis/australian-open-2022-andy-murray-granted-wildcard-at-melbourne-park/news-story/aba29b6d0338bc7e0cacdb4760aecd19 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzLmNvbS5hdS9zcG9ydC90ZW5uaXMvYXVzdHJhbGlhbi1vcGVuLTIwMjItYW5keS1tdXJyYXktZ3JhbnRlZC13aWxkY2FyZC1hdC1tZWxib3VybmUtcGFyay9uZXdzLXN0b3J5L2FiYTI5YjZkMDMzOGJjN2UwY2FjZGI0NzYwYWVjZDE50gGYAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3MuY29tLmF1L3Nwb3J0L3Rlbm5pcy9hdXN0cmFsaWFuLW9wZW4tMjAyMi1hbmR5LW11cnJheS1ncmFudGVkLXdpbGRjYXJkLWF0LW1lbGJvdXJuZS1wYXJrL25ld3Mtc3RvcnkvYWJhMjliNmQwMzM4YmM3ZTBjYWNkYjQ3NjBhZWNkMTk_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

The clean hydrogen production leader’s pyrolysis technology has met D.O.E.’s stringent eligibility requirements for a program designed to accelerate the commercial deployment of innovative energy technology

Monolith a leader in clean materials production announced it has received conditional approval for a $1.04 billion loan from the U.S. Department of Energy (D.O.E.). Established via the Title XVII Innovative Energy Loan Guarantee Program the loan will allow Monolith to expand its clean hydrogen and carbon black production facilities in Hallam Nebraska U.S.A.

Reaching the ambitious goal of global decarbonization by 2050 will require the innovation of American companies like Monolith and the resources of like-minded organizations like the Department of Energy.

“Monolith was founded with the belief that private sector companies could develop the innovation needed to help lead the clean energy transition while also creating high-paying green jobs and strengthening our nation’s supply chain.”

Jennifer Granholm Department of Energy Secretary.

The Title XVII Innovative Energy Loan Guarantee Program’s purpose is to recognize and support technology that reduces emissions and supports a clean energy future.

“Advanced clean production technology like Monolith’s are the types of impactful projects that support not just sustainability but economic growth and clean energy jobs for the American people.”

Monolith cleanly produces essential materials utilized by a wide variety of industries including hydrogen ammonia and carbon black. Carbon black is a material found in many everyday products but is perhaps most commonly known for its use in tires. Leading tire manufacturers including Goodyear and Michelin expressed their support for the D.O.E.’s conditional approval and Monolith’s technology.

Richard J. Kramer chairman chief executive officer and president The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company.

As the only U.S.-headquartered tire manufacturer it’s especially rewarding to be at the connection point of significant U.S. innovation with Monolith and the commitment of the Department of Energy to sustainable outcomes.

“We are excited to work with Monolith to reduce our carbon footprint and further our use of alternative materials as we continue to deliver industry-leading products.”

Alexis Garcin chairman and president of Michelin North America Inc.

Promoting the mobility of people and goods while protecting our planet requires investments in innovative and sustainable solutions.

“Partnering with organizations like Monolith with the support of the Department of Energy is the latest example of how we at Michelin intend to further accelerate toward our goal of a 100% sustainable tire by 2050 for a better life in motion.”

In addition to carbon black Monolith’s innovative methane pyrolysis process creates cost- effective clean hydrogen. As the world builds a roadmap to decarbonization the energy density of clean hydrogen fuel has been recognized as one of the critical paths to creating a green world.

Shipping aviation long-haul trucking energy storage and clean steel production are areas with the potential to rely on clean hydrogen fuel. Monolith also expects to use much of the clean hydrogen produced from its Olive Creek expansion for the production of cleanly made ammonia that will be distributed in the U.S. Corn belt to help feed a growing national and world population.

John Ketchum president and chief executive officer NextEra Energy Resources.

As the leader in wind and solar energy and as an investor in Monolith NextEra Energy Resources is encouraged by the U.S. Department of Energy’s conditional approval of Monolith’s loan application.

“Monolith’s clean hydrogen production process is powered by locally-produced renewable electricity and represents a significant advancement to support cost-effective decarbonization of multiple sectors of the U.S. economy.”

Title XVII of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (42 U.S.C. Sec. 16511 et. seq.) provides authority for the D.O.E. to guarantee loans for projects that “avoid reduce or sequester air pollutants or anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases; and employ new or significantly improved technologies as compared to commercial technologies in service in the United States at the time the guarantee is issued.”

Current conventional processes to create carbon black release large amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Through Monolith’s methane pyrolysis technology the company is able to prevent an estimated 2.3 tons of CO2 from being released for every ton of carbon black produced.

With its production of cleanly made hydrogen carbon black and ammonia Monolith expects that its Olive Creek expansion will prevent one million tons of greenhouse gas emissions from entering the atmosphere each year compared to traditional manufacturing processes. While this conditional commitment demonstrates DOE’s intent to finance the project several steps remain and certain conditions must be satisfied before a final loan guarantee is issued.

Monolith’s expansion is expected to generate significant economic development starting with approximately 1000 jobs to support facility expansion. Once completed the facility will generate around 260 direct and 600 indirect high-paying highly skilled green energy jobs to support its operations.

Once completed Monolith’s expanded Olive Creek plant is expected to be the largest carbon black production facility in the United States producing an estimated 194000 metric tons per year. The construction of this innovative facility is expected to be performed by Kiewit one of North America’s largest and most respected engineering and construction organizations.

Rick Lanoha president and CEO of Kiewit Corporation.

We’re excited to bring our engineering procurement and construction experience and skilled people to the Olive Creek plant expansion project which will help Monolith commercialize a new innovative technology to produce cost-effective clean hydrogen and materials.

“Kiewit is a Nebraska company so providing EPC services and jobs to a significant project in this state is important to us. We’re fully committed to safely delivering this important sustainable project to help Monolith meet global demand.”

Hanson added “This loan which comes after several years of due diligence further supports what our customers employees investors and strategic partners already know: Monolith’s pyrolysis technology will play a vital role in the energy transition.”

“We are honored to have reached this significant milestone on our path toward helping the world to decarbonize and we are appreciative of the confidence shown by the Department of Energy and Secretary Granholm.”

Monolith which was founded in 2012 developed a process technology that uses 100% renewable energy to convert natural gas into clean hydrogen and carbon black. The company is currently operating its first commercial-scale production facility in Hallam Nebraska and has offices and R&D facilities in Lincoln NE; San Carlos CA; Denver CO and Kansas City MO.

The Nike Blazer Low Jumbo though arguably less timeless than the original has become somewhat of a mainstay offering. More and more colorways are beginning to appear and this latest provides a look that reminds me of the ever-beloved Chunky Dunky.

This is due entirely to the inclusion of primary colors which dresses the silhouette’s more forward-facing elements. The left shoe’s enlarged Swoosh for starters boasts a bright sky blue; and when complemented by the deep green checks on the right the connection to Ben & Jerry’s pints begins to come into focus. Additionally a pale yellow and red also join the palette alternating atop the tongue whose laces and surrounding leather opt for a neutral white.

Enjoy an official look at these Blazer Low Jumbos here and sit tight for their upcoming 2022 release.

RAVENNA Ky. — Chesapeake & Ohio 2-8-4 2716 will visit New England following its restoration the Kentucky Steam Heritage Corporation announced on Saturday.

Kentucky Steam has inked an agreement with the Railroad Museum of New England to bring the big main line steam locomotive to its Naugatuck Railroad in Connecticut at some point in the future for a months-long residency. The visit will kick off what is expected to be a year-long trip from its home base in Ravenna Ky. where it is currently being restored.

C&O 2716’s trip to Connecticut — which Kentucky Steam President Chris Campbell said could happen sometime in the middle part of the decade — would be the first visit of a main line steam locomotive to New England in more than a generation. Kentucky Steam said additional stops on its maiden tour would be announced at a later date.

“We’re pleased to be hosting C&O 2716 on our railroad as it will be the first large steam locomotive to operate in New England since (the 1970s)” said Howard Pincus chairman of RMNE. “It’s a wonderful opportunity to partner with a capable and visionary group like KSHC. Moving operational steam locomotives between heritage groups is quite common in Great Britain but has only been done a few times in the United States.”

While many small steam locomotives have operated in New England in recent decades visits by large main line steamers have been few and far between. In the 1960s and 1970s Nickel Plate Road 2-8-4 759 led excursions there for Steamtown and Ross Rowland’s High Iron Company. And in 1975 Reading Company 2101 lead the American Freedom Train all the way to Portland Maine. Since then the largest steam locomotive to grace New England’s main line rails has been Canadian Pacific 4-6-2 1201 which made a trek across northern Maine in 1989.

The exact dates of the visit have yet to be determined and officials said they would not be announced until certain restoration benchmarks had been met. However there were already plans in the works for excursions along the Naugatuck’s 19-mile line between Waterbury and Torrington Conn. and even photo freights.

Kentucky Steam has been restoring 2716 since 2015. The group also owns a 40-acre former CSX Transportation yard in Estill County Ky. where the work has been taking place. Campbell tells Railfan & Railroad that for the last few years the non-profit has been focusing on working on the shop facility itself. Now that a lot of that work has been completed they plan on focusing on the locomotive more which is about 30 percent done.

“We are several years off from making our way up east” he said. “But with announcements like this we hope people who have considered contributing to the restoration can see an end goal in sight. We are excited to get the engine fully operational and bring people to us in Kentucky. But we are equally as excited to get out on the road.”

Campbell said while Class I railroads including CSX and Norfolk Southern have been very generous to the non-profit it’s important to not simply rely or hope for chances to get out on their rails. He said that working with established short line and tourist operators will get 2716 in front of more people when the locomotive is again running.

Along with Saturday’s announcement KSHC is spearheading a fundraiser to secure $10000 for the locomotive’s restoration by the end of 2021. To make a project-dedicated tax-deductible donation to the locomotive’s rehab visit www.kentuckysteam.org/donate or by mail to Kentucky Steam Heritage Corporation 499 Kirkland Ave Irvine KY 40336.

Its rehoming centres are often one of the first places aspiring new dog owners visit meaning the charity receives a high demand all-year-round.

But it is especially at Christmas time when the charity says it receives a lot of interest as families look to cheer up their festive periods by welcoming a new pet into their home.

The charity's popular slogan ‘a dog is for life not just for Christmas’ has been used in its marketing material for years and continues to apply today.

Explaining whether the Dogs Trust rehomes its pets at Christmas Adam Clowes Dogs Trust operations director said: “Every dog deserves to find their special someone and this doesn’t change because it’s Christmas.

""Dog ownership is a wonderful thing but our slogan ‘a dog is for life not just for Christmas’ is about reminding people that it’s a lifelong commitment which must be carefully considered not just at Christmas but all year round.

“Not everyone celebrates the festive season and for some families having additional time off from work and other commitments could make it a good time to settle in a new dog.

""We will only ever rehome a dog after careful discussion with their new family and if they’re having a particularly busy Christmas the dog will stay and celebrate Christmas with us ready to head off to their new home in the New Year.”

It comes as RSPCA rescuers fear animal neglect will rise this Christmas with 84 per cent of rescuers at the charity concerned more people are taking on pets without understanding how to care for them.

Approximately 30 minutes after launch Webb detached from the Ariane 5 rocket marking the beginning of a million-mile journey and the start of a two-week complex deployment process to unfold the spacecraft in preparation for arrival at Lagrange Point 2 (L2).

“Since the dawn of the space age NASA international partner agencies and industry partners together with Northrop Grumman have been defining what is possible in space science and exploration” said Kathy Warden chairman chief executive officer and president Northrop Grumman. “Over the next few weeks the James Webb Space Telescope will transform into an awe-inspiring scientific tool that will usher in a new era in human discovery.”

During the journey to L2 Webb will convert from its stowed position in which it left Earth to the configuration that will allow it to see light coming from the earliest stars to shine in the Universe. Part of this journey is to unfold the tennis court-sized five-layer sunshield around the sensitive mirrors that allow Webb to take pictures and collect data that will come back to Earth for scientific review. Once operational Webb will explore farther than ever before into the cosmos looking back 13.5 billion years.

For the last time on Earth the James Webb Space Telescope’s sunshield was deployed and tensioned by testing teams at Northrop Grumman in Redondo Beach California where final deployment tests were completed.

To deliver this kind of scientific data Webb incorporates innovative design advanced technology and groundbreaking engineering. Ten technological inventions were created to build the revolutionary telescope so that it can detect light from the first stars and galaxies. Some of these innovations include optics detectors and thermal control systems.

The Webb telescope is the biggest observatory built for launch into space. Its 18 gold-plated mirrors make for a system that is far more sensitive than the Hubble Space Telescope which it will succeed as humanity’s most powerful scientific instrument for studying the formation of our universe and distant worlds in our galaxy.

But the Webb with a price tag of some $10 billion has trudged through one of the most fraught development timelines of any space program lasting over two decades and costing billions more than its original estimate.

“The stuff they faced was what a lot of space programs face because everything has to be perfect on a spacecraft like that — you can’t go fix it after launch” said Cristina Chaplain who for roughly a decade led audits of the James Webb Space Telescope at the Government Accountability Office Congress’ watchdog agency.

“It’s very complex and fragile” she said. “There’s going to be mistakes but on a program like that one little teensy thing can have dramatic consequences.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vYnJlYWtpbmdkZWZlbnNlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzEyL2l0cy1ib3RoLWFpLXRlY2hub2xvZ3ktYW5kLWV0aGljcy10aGF0LXdpbGwtZW5hYmxlLWphZGMyL9IBY2h0dHBzOi8vYnJlYWtpbmdkZWZlbnNlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzEyL2l0cy1ib3RoLWFpLXRlY2hub2xvZ3ktYW5kLWV0aGljcy10aGF0LXdpbGwtZW5hYmxlLWphZGMyLz9hbXA9MQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,It’s both AI technology and ethics that will enable JADC2,"Questions that loom large for the wider application of artificial intelligence (AI) in Defense Department operations often center on trust. How does the operator know if the AI is wrong that it made a mistake that it didn’t behave as intended?

Answers to questions like that come from a technical discipline known as Responsible AI (RAI). It’s the subject of a report issued by the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) in mid-November called Responsible AI Guidelines in Practice which addresses a requirement in the FY21 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) to ensure that the DoD has “the ability requisite resourcing and sufficient expertise to ensure that any artificial intelligence technology…is ethically and reasonably developed.”

DIU’s RAI guidelines provide a framework for AI companies DOD stakeholders and program managers that can help to ensure that AI programs are built with the principles of fairness accountability and transparency at each step in the development cycle of an AI system according to Jared Dunnmon technical director of the artificial intelligence/machine learning portfolio at DIU.

This framework is designed to achieve four goals said Dunnmon:

Clarify end goals align expectations and acknowledge risks and tradeoffs in order to speed development;

Employ fairness accountability and transparency in the development testing and vetting of AI systems in order to avoid things like bias in facial recognition systems for example;

Improve evaluation selection prototyping and adoption in order to avoid potential bad outcomes; and

Foment constructive questions and conversations that can help imbue AI projects with better success.

Trust in the AI is foremost

Just like Isaac Asimov’s Three Laws of Robotics describes ethical behavior for robots the DIU’s guidelines offer five ethical principles for development and use of artificial intelligence.

Responsible : DoD personnel will exercise appropriate levels of judgment and care while remaining responsible for the development deployment and use of AI capabilities. That means that human beings maintain responsibility for the development and use of AI. Equitable : The DoD will take deliberate steps to minimize unintended bias in AI capabilities. That requires reducing bias through testing selection of adequate training sets and diverse engineering teams. Traceable : The Defense Department’s AI capabilities will be developed and deployed in such a manner that relevant personnel possess an understanding of the technology development processes and operational methods including transparent and auditable methodologies data sources and design procedure and documentation. Reliable : The DoD’s AI capabilities will have explicit well-defined mission use cases and the safety security and effectiveness of such capabilities will be subject to testing and assurance within those defined uses across their entire life cycles. Governable : DoD will design and engineer AI capabilities to fulfill their intended functions while possessing the ability to detect and avoid unintended consequences and have the ability to disengage or deactivate deployed systems that demonstrate unintended behavior.

It’s that fifth principle governable that addresses the questions asked at the top about letting the operator know when the AI is wrong. Operators need to establish trust in the AI systems or they simply won’t be used. That’s not an option for something as complex as the Joint All Domain Command and Control concept of operations.

“Governable AI systems allow for graceful termination and human intervention when algorithms do not behave as intended” said Dr. Amanda Muller Consulting AI Systems Engineer and Technical Fellow who is the Responsible AI Lead for Northrop Grumman which is one of the few companies with such a position. “At that point the human operator can either take over or make adjustments to the inputs to the algorithm or whatever needs to be done. But the human always maintains the ability to govern that AI algorithm.”

Northrop Grumman’s adoption of these RAI principles builds justified confidence in the AI systems being created because the human can understand and interpret what the AI is doing determine if it’s operating correctly through verification and validation and take actions if it is not.

The importance of doing so is clear for the future of AI in the military. If AI systems do not work as designed or are unpredictable “leaders will not adopt them operators will not use them Congress will not fund them and the American people will not support them” states the Final Report from the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence (NSCAI). This commission was a temporary independent federal entity created by Congress in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019. The commission was led by former Google CEO Eric Schmidt and former Deputy Secretary of Defense Robert Work and delivered its 756-page Final Report in March 2021 disbanding in October.

“The power of AI is its ability to learn and adapt to changing situations” said Muller. “The battlefield is a dynamic environment and the side that adapts fastest gains the advantage. Like with all systems though AI is vulnerable to attack and failure. To truly harness the power of AI technology developers must align with the ethical principles adopted by the DoD.”

The complexity of all-domain operations will demand AI

The DoD’s pledge to develop and implement only Responsible Artificial Intelligence will underpin development of systems for JADC2. An OODA (Observe Orient Decide Act) loop stretching from space to air and ground and to sea and cyber will only be possible through the ability of an AI system to control the JADC2 infrastructure.

“The AI could perceive and reason on the best ways to move information across different platforms nodes and decision makers” explained Vern Boyle Vice President of Advanced Processing Solutions for Northrop Grumman’s Networked Information Solutions division. “And it could optimize the movement of that information and the configuration of the network because it’ll be very complex.

“We’ll be operating in contested environments where it will be difficult for a human to react and understand how to keep the network and the comm links functioning. The use of AI to control the communication and networking infrastructure is going to be one big application area.”

At the same time RAI will serve as a counterweight to America’s Great Power competitors China and Russia who certainly won’t engage in ethical AI as they push for power. As part of its strategic plan China has declared it will be the global leader in AI by 2030 and its investments in dual-use technologies like advanced processing cyber security and AI are threats to U.S. technical and cognitive dominance.

“The key difference is that China is applying AI technologies broadly throughout the country” said Boyle. “They are using AI for surveillance and tracking their citizens students and visitors. They use AI to monitor online behaviors social interactions and biometrics.

“China has no concern about privacy rights or ethical application of the data that AI is able to gather and share. All data is collected and used by both industry and the Chinese government to advance their goal of global technical dominance by 2030.”

Fundamental to the U.S response to China’s actions is assuring that the Defense Department’s use of AI reflects democratic values according to Boyle.

“It is critical that we move rapidly to set the global standard for responsible and ethical AI use and to stay ahead of China and Russia’s advances toward the lowest common denominator. The U.S. our ally partners and all democratic-minded nations must work together to lead the development of global standards around AI and talent development.”

Northrop Grumman systems to close the connectivity/networking gap

Doing so will help to close one of the most significant capability gaps facing armed forces right now which is basic connectivity and networking. The platforms and sensors needed to support JADC2—satellites unmanned air and ground systems and guided missile destroyers to name a few—aren’t necessarily able to connect and move information effectively because of legacy communications and networking systems.

That reality will dampen the DoD’s ambitions for AI and machine learning for tactical operations.

“It’s both a gap and a challenge” observed Boyle. “Let’s assume though that everyone’s connected. Now there’s an information problem. Not everybody shares their information. It’s not described in a standard way. Having the ability to understand and reason on information presumes that you’re able to understand it. Those capabilities aren’t necessarily mature yet either.”

There are also challenges with respect to multi-level security and the ability to share and distribute information at different classification levels. That adds a level of complexity that’s not typically present in the commercial sector.

The severity of this issue and the need to solve it in the name of all-domain operations is driving Northrop Grumman to prioritize the successful application of AI to communications and networking.

The company has numerous capabilities deployed now on important platforms such as Global Hawk and is working with customers to leverage gateway systems in service now for data relay while developing new capabilities to address gaps in communications and networking.

Northrop Grumman’s portfolio already contains enabling technologies needed to connect joint forces including advanced networking AI/ML space command and control systems autonomous systems powered by collaborative autonomy and advanced resiliency features needed to protect against emerging threats. And it is developing AI that acts as the connective tissue for military platforms sensors and systems to communicate with one another—enabling them to pass information and data using secure open systems similar to how we use the Internet and 5G in our day-to-day lives.

“The DoD has stated that it must have an AI-enabled force by 2025 because speed will be the differentiator in future battles” said Boyle “That means speed to understand the battle space; speed to determine the best course of action to take in a very complex and dynamic battle space; and speed to be able to take appropriate actions. Together they will let the DoD more quickly execute the OODA Loop (Observe Orient Decide Act).

“AI and advanced specialized processing at the tactical edge will provide a strategic information advantage. AI and edge computing are the core enabling technologies for JADC2.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cmFzaWFudGltZXMuY29tL3VzLW5ldy1tYW50cmEtYWZ0ZXItY29tYmF0LXVhdnMtd2FzaGluZ3Rvbi1ub3ctaW52ZXN0aW5nLWluLWRyb25lcy_SAWFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ldXJhc2lhbnRpbWVzLmNvbS91cy1uZXctbWFudHJhLWFmdGVyLWNvbWJhdC11YXZzLXdhc2hpbmd0b24tbm93LWludmVzdGluZy1pbi1kcm9uZXMv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US’ ‘New Mantra’: After Combat UAV’s Washington Now Investing In ‘Highly Enduring’ Underwater Drones,"Northrop Grumman and Martin Defense Group have been chosen by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to proceed to the second phase of the Manta Ray undersea drone project.

While air-borne drones have been widely used by militaries across the world unmanned underwater vehicles (UUV) are a relatively newer concept. The goal of the initiative according to DARPA’s press release is to build underwater vehicles that can function without human assistance even for logistical support or maintenance.

Since UUVs are designed to stay underwater for extended periods of time they must have exceptional endurance.

The UUV as shown in a concept video is planned to function at extreme depths in the oceans and may be configured to carry extra payloads that could perform specialized tasks.

On 20 December the Pentagon research agency announced that the two companies will develop full-scale demonstration versions of the vehicle that would be “able to operate on long-duration long-range missions in ocean environments.

“The Manta Ray program has made substantial progress in enabling payload-capable autonomous underwater vehicles to function without the need for crewed vessels or support infrastructure” stated Kyle Woerner Manta Ray’s program manager.

“Manta Ray is in a unique position to introduce a new kind of underwater vehicle while also contributing important component technologies to other critical undersea programs.”

The video shows the vehicle releasing a smaller sensor-like payload which emits a signal and then returns to the Manta Ray. According to DARPA “the Manta Ray program completed Phase 1 with Critical Design Reviews that confirmed design maturity and readiness for proceeding to Phase 2.”

Now the focus will be “on subsystem testing fabrication and full-scale integrated vehicle in-water demonstrations” the agency said.

The US Navy recently stated that it has begun building a facility in California that will house many of these autonomous vehicle technologies as well as the testing activities that go along with them.

Creating A Hub For Surface Subsurface Drones

The Navy recently revealed new plans for a “purpose-built” facility specialized for testing its latest unmanned surface and subsurface vehicles at its warfare center in Port Hueneme.

This facility will serve as a gateway for Navy learning and experimentation on unmanned maritime vehicle prototype capabilities operations and maintenance in order to guide future programs.

The new facility will also serve as a staging area for the service’s many prototypes and experimental vessels. Several unique unmanned vehicles such as ‘Sea Hunter’ and ‘Overlord’ have been developed by the Navy in collaboration with Pentagon research and development agencies over the past several years but many of them are still technically housed by those same research agencies.

On December 8 the service announced the completion of modifications to an existing building that would now house XLUUV prototypes as well as the personnel who will test them after fabrication by prime contractor Boeing is concluded.

The Extra Large Unmanned Undersea Vehicle (XLUUV) and prototypes for the Medium and Large Unmanned Surface Vehicles are among the systems that will be deployed at Port Hueneme.

The new facility in California will serve as a single hub for all of these vehicles. It also puts them near squadrons dedicated to testing with unmanned technologies such as the Surface Development Squadron in San Diego.

Does China Have Manta Ray-Type Drone?

Early in September 2021 Chinese media reported that the Chinese researchers from a military-linked university have conducted the first open sea test of a bionic robot that resembles and glides like the American Manta Ray drone in South China Sea.

Spy fish? China tests manta ray submersible drone in South China sea. Emeritus Professor @NoelSharkey from @shefcompsci comments on China's first open sea test of a bionic robot that looks and swims like a manta ray. https://t.co/VjKW43110E — EngineeringSheffield (@SheffUniEng) September 28 2021

The drone test was initially announced on September 6 by Xinhua a Chinese state-run news agency. In a video the bright yellow unmanned undersea vehicle (UUV) is seen releasing into the water near the disputed Xisha Islands also known as the Paracel Islands. China Taiwan and Vietnam all stake claim to these islands.

The design of the Chinese UUV is similar to Manta Ray’s and can “flap its wings and slide underwater”. The drone is a fine example of biomimetics a design technology that incorporates physical attributes of biological species. The new 470-kilogram (1036-pound) bionic soft robot prototype with a three-meter wingspan can dive to a depth of up to 1025 meters according to Xinhua.

The drone has “high propulsion efficiency great maneuverability high stability low environmental disturbance low noise large load capacity and smooth seafloor landing” according to the developers. The cost of the Chinese UUV is unknown although the project appears to be further along than its competitors.

Biomimetics is becoming increasingly popular around the world. The manta ray has been imitated in a variety of projects including the US’ Manta Ray project the British Royal Marines’ Raydrive and Singaporean MantaDroid.

Chinese state media reported that the “manta ray” had already been employed to evaluate the ocean environment on a significant coral reef in the Paracels. Vietnam has regularly criticized China’s activity in the area so an underwater reconnaissance capability would be a major concern for the country.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjEvMTAvMjAvc2NpZW5jZS93ZWJiLXRlbGVzY29wZS1hc3Ryb25vbXktaG9tb3Bob2JpYS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Webb Telescope's Latest Stumbling Block: Its Name (Published 2021),"Many astronomers were disappointed when NASA’s up-and-coming space telescope the successor to the vaunted Hubble Space Telescope was named for James Webb a former NASA administrator who led the agency through the glory years of the Apollo missions. Why not name it for an astronomer the way other space missions — Hubble Kepler — have been instead of a bean counter? But they held their tongues.

After all the new telescope which is now scheduled to be launched from a spaceport in French Guiana on Dec. 18 was designed to be bigger and more powerful than the Hubble. Orbiting the sun a million miles from Earth it will be capable of bringing into focus the earliest stars and galaxies in the universe and closely inspecting the atmospheres of nearby exoplanets for signs of life or habitability.

Now a new objection to the Webb name has arisen inflaming the astronomical community. In 2015 Dan Savage a columnist for The Stranger a Seattle newspaper called attention to the fact that James Webb before running NASA had been the under secretary of state in the Truman administration during the Lavender Scare a period when thousands of gay men and lesbians lost their government jobs as potential security risks. Was this the kind of person to name a groundbreaking telescope after?

That question gained prominence this spring when four astronomers — Lucianne Walkowicz of the JustSpace Alliance and Adler Planetarium in Chicago Chanda Prescod-Weinstein of the University of New Hampshire Brian Nord of the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory and of the University of Chicago and Sarah Tuttle of the University of Washington — published an op-ed in Scientific American under the title “The James Webb Space Telescope Needs to Be Renamed.”"

Brian had a discussion earlier this year with NVIDIA on one of his regular podcasts. You can get some NVIDIA DPU detail here.

The features are impressive but first let’s take a look at the evolution of the DPU. If you are not into the history you can skip down to the details for the NVIDIA BlueField-2. It started in the ’90s when Intel x86 processors delivered unmatched power to enterprises combined with an OS. Next came the client/server then the advent of distributed processing. Software development and growing databases accelerated rapidly causing an explosion of hardware deployment into the data center.

In the early 2000s VMware introduced the ESX hypervisor and virtualized the x86 CPU allowing multiple operating system instances to run on a single server. VMs were not necessarily new; IBM ran virtual machines on their mainframes for many years before creating the ESX hypervisor. However this development led to the data center infrastructure aggregation growth.

Hardware was now programmable with developers writing code that defined and provisioned virtual machines without manual intervention. This led to the eventual push for migration to cloud computing.

VMware realized the success of its ESX platform and moved quickly into storage and network virtualization. Not to be outdone EMC teamed up with Cisco to build their own virtualized network and storage solution. A flurry of acquisitions took place. VMware developed vSANS integrated into their vSphere platform.

The development of this converged infrastructure is called Software-Defined Data Center(SDDC). The big players Microsoft VMware Cisco and EMC all scrambled to win the SDDC market. Everything became programmable: I/O security OS applications etc. SDDC was just a CPU component taxing the available resources used for other services.

All this convergence and programmability lead to Artificial Intelligence(AI) development where GPUs were developed to address the processing requirements for these graphic-intensive applications. This leads to the development of hardware offloading some of the operations from the CPU. Networking functions typically CPU intensive were offloaded and NVIDIA jumped on this new opportunity acquired Mellanox to develop smart network adapters.

GPUs became smarter and smart NICs were pivotal in removing the network and graphics processing from the overall SDDC aggregation. Ultimately the development of DPU is the result of offloaded intelligence from the CPU.

The new NVIDIA BlueField-2 DPU has created a system on a chip combining multi-core CPU high-performance network interface and programmable acceleration engines.

NVIDIA BlueField-2 DPU – The Meat

CPU v GPU v DPU: What Makes a DPU Different?

A DPU is a new class of programmable processors that combines three key elements. A DPU is a system on a chip or SoC that combines:

An industry-standard high-performance software-programmable multi-core CPU typically based on the widely used Arm architecture tightly coupled to the other SoC components. A high-performance network interface capable of parsing processing and efficiently transferring data at line rate or the speed of the rest of the network to GPUs and CPUs. A rich set of flexible and programmable acceleration engines that offload and improve applications performance for AI and machine learning security telecommunications and storage among others.

The NVIDIA® BlueField®-2 DPU is the first data center infrastructure-on-a-chip optimized for modern cloud and HPC. Delivering a broad set of accelerated software-defined networking storage security and management services with the ability to offload accelerate and isolate data center infrastructure. Equipped with 200Gb/s Ethernet or InfiniBand connectivity the BlueField-2 DPU accelerates the network path for both the control plane and the data plane and is armed with “zero trust” security to prevent data breaches and cyber-attacks.

NVIDIA ConnectX®-6 Dx combines the network adapter with an array of Arm® cores and infrastructure-specific offloads offering purpose-built hardware-acceleration engines with full software programmability. Sitting at the edge of every server BlueField-2 empowers agile secured and high-performance cloud and artificial intelligence (AI) workloads and reduces TCO while increasing data center efficiency.

A DPU For Storage Networks And Machine Learning

Let’s take a look at how the new BlueField-2 tackles fast storage technologies. BlueField offers a complete solution for storage platforms such as NVMe over Fabrics (NVMe-oF) All-Flash Array (AFA) and a storage controller for JBOF server caching (memcached) disaggregated rack storage and scale-out direct-attached storage. The smarts in this DPU make it a flexible choice.

NVIDIA has posted the impressive results of their test for the BlueField-2 here. The test environment is included in the blog.

Complete Storage Solution

BlueField-2 utilizes the processing power of Arm cores for storage applications such as All-Flash Arrays using NVMe-oF Ceph Lustre iSCSI/TCP offload Flash Translation Layer data compression/decompression and deduplication.

In high-performance storage arrays BlueField-2 functions as the system’s main CPU handling storage controller tasks and traffic termination. It can also be configured as a co-processor offloading specific storage tasks from the host isolating part of the storage media from the host or enabling abstraction of software-defined storage logic using the BlueField Arm cores.

NVMe over Fabrics Capabilities

Utilizing the advanced capabilities of NVMe-oF BlueField RDMA-based technology delivers remote storage access performance equal to that of local storage with minimal CPU overhead enabling efficient disaggregated storage and hyper-converged solutions.

Storage Acceleration

The BlueField embedded PCIe switch enables customers to build standalone storage appliances and connect a single BlueField to multiple storage devices without an external switch.

Signature Handover

The BlueField embedded network controller enables hardware checking of T10 Data Integrity Field/Protection Information (T10-DIF/PI) reducing software overhead and accelerating delivery of data to the application. Signature handover is handled by the adapter on ingress and egress packets reducing the load on the software at the Initiator and Target machines.

BlueField for Networking & Security

Whether in the form of a smartNIC or as a standalone network platform the new Bluefield-2 provides an efficient deployment of networking applications. Using a combination of advanced offloads and Arm compute capabilities BlueField terminates network and security protocols inline.

BlueField SmartNIC

As a network adapter you get the flexibility to fully or partially implement the data and control planes unlocking more efficient use of compute resources. The programmability of the adapter provides the ability to integrate new data and control plane functionality.

BlueField Security Features

When it comes to security the integration of encryption offloads for symmetric and asymmetric crypto operations makes it a great choice for implementing security applications. Security is built into the DNA of the data center infrastructure reducing threat exposure minimizing risk and enabling prevention detection and response to potential threats in real-time.

Painless Virtualization

PCIe SR-IOV technology from NVIDIA data center administrators will benefit from better server utilization while reducing cost power and cable complexity allowing more Virtual Machines and more tenants on the same hardware. This certainly addresses any TCO concerns.

Overlay Networks

Datacenter operators use network overlay technologies (VXLAN NVGRE GENEVE) to overcome scalability barriers. By providing advanced offloading engines that encapsulate/de-capsulate the overlay protocol headers this DPU allows the traditional offloads to operate on the tunneled protocols and also offloads NAT routing capabilities.

BlueField for Machine Learning Environments

Of course NVIDIA has addressed the AI/ML market with this new DPU providing cost-effective and integrative solutions for Machine Learning appliances. Multiple GPUs can be connected via the PCIe Gen 3.0/4.0 interface. With its RDMA and GPUDirect® RDMA technologies BlueField-2 offers efficient data delivery for real-time analytics and data insights.

RDMA Acceleration

The network controller data path hardware utilizes RDMA and RoCE technology delivering low latency and high throughput with near-zero CPU cycles.

BlueField for Multi-GPU Platforms

BlueField-2 enables the attachment of multiple GPUs through its integrated PCIe switch. BlueField PCIe 4.0 support is future-proofed for next-generation GPU devices.

PeerDirect®

PeerDirect a Mellanox product is an accelerated communication architecture that supports peer-to-peer communication between BlueField and third-party hardware such as GPUs (e.g. NVIDIA GPUDirect RDMA) co-processor adapters (e.g. Intel Xeon Phi) or storage adapters. PeerDirect provides a standardized architecture where devices can directly communicate to remote devices across the fabric avoiding unnecessary system memory copies and CPU overhead by copying data directly to/from devices.

GPUDirect RDMA Technology

The rapid increase in the performance of graphics hardware coupled with recent improvements in GPU programmability has made graphic accelerators a compelling platform for computationally demanding tasks in a wide variety of application domains. Since GPUs provide high core count and floating-point operations capabilities high-speed networking is required to connect between the platforms to provide high throughput and the lowest latency for GPU-to-GPU communications. GPUDirect RDMA is a technology implemented within Bluefield-2 and NVIDIA GPUs that enables a direct path for data exchange between GPUs and the high-speed interconnect.

GPUDirect RDMA provides order-of-magnitude improvements for both communication bandwidth and communication latency between GPU devices of different cluster nodes.

Conclusion

The NVIDIA testing revealed the following performance characteristics of the BlueField DPU:

Testing with smaller 512B I/O sizes resulted in higher IOPS but lower-than-line-rate throughput while 4KB I/O sizes resulted in higher throughput but lower IOPS numbers.

100 percent read and 100 percent write workloads provided similar IOPS and throughput while 50/50 mixed read/write workloads produced a higher performance by using both directions of the network connection simultaneously.

Using SPDK resulted in higher performance than kernel-space software but at the cost of higher server CPU utilization which is expected behavior since SPDK runs in userspace with constant polling.

The newer Linux 5.15 kernel performed better than the 4.18 kernel due to storage improvements added regularly by the Linux community.

Overall the results from the internal test are pretty impressive. The BlueField-2 reached 41.5 million IOPS which is more than four times that of any other DPU on the market today.

Standard networking results were also impressive. The DPU clocked more than five million 4KB IOPS and seven million to over 20 million 512KB IOPS for NVMe-oF. If you are looking to improve overall performance in the data center this DPU should fit the bill.

Just like your Christmas turkey I have stuffed this system full of high-end hardware and added a small splash of RGB lighting to keep the Christmas spirit alive.

Recently a friend of mine asked me to build him a new gaming system which normally wouldn’t be a problem. However in the current climate with the extortionate graphics card prices it took me a while to put together a spec that was affordable and also available. After a few days with various stock informer Discord notifications being sent I finally settled on an RTX 3080 Ti (not the best value for money but needs must and all that) that was in stock so I grabbed it at almost £1490 (ouch).

With approximately £2500 to spend on the whole system (which would normally sound like a very healthy budget) we set about picking the rest of the parts for this system. The RTX 3080 Ti took up a big share of the budget but I managed to get what I think is a pretty decent spec gaming system and should hopefully give him a few enjoyable years of gaming with solid graphics performance.

System Specification:

Luckily my friend isn’t too fussy with how his systems look but there were a couple of requests regarding aesthetics. A black case had to be used and RGB should be kept to a minimum so pretty simple overall. I think I managed to fulfil those requests as you can see the build turned out to look quite stealthy with its mostly black interior and just the graphics card adding a splash of colour from the RGB lighting effects.

There are a couple of things worth mentioning about the build. I didn’t get the chance to review the Corsair 4000D case series when it was launched Leo had the pleasure of that but I have to say that now I have built a couple of systems in the 4000D it feels like a great budget case. I am also glad that Corsair chose to use plain black fans in the 4000D as the look worked perfectly with the theme of this build.

KitGuru says: Overall I was very pleased with how this build turned out minimal RGB lighting and the stealthy black interior is pleasing to the eye. I think I did pretty well with the spec for the budget available in the current market. What do you guys think of this £2500 build?

It is based on the GA104-770-A1 Ampere chip and offers 8 GB GDDR6 graphics memory with a 256 Bit memory bus. It supports PCIe 4.0 and will be available in two different variants from 80 to 125 Watt (TGP). As package the notebook graphic card uses GB5-256 and the chip size is 40x40mm. The GPU supports eDP 1.4b to connect the internal monitor.

There is no more Max-Q variant (formerly used for the low power variants) but every OEM can choose to implement Max-Q technologies (Dynamic Boost Whispermode).

The performance depends on the TGP setting and cooling of the laptop. On average it should be similar to the old RTX 2080 Super Mobile and therefore best suited for QHD - 4k gaming. The similar named RTX 3070 desktop card is significantly faster.

The GA104 chip offers 6144 FP32 ALUs of which half can also execute INT32 instructions (i.e. 3072 INT32 ALUs). The RTX 3070 however wont use all ALUs on the chip. With Turing all shaders could still execute FP32 or INT32 instructions. The raytracing and tensor cores on the chip were also improved according to Nvidia. The RTX 3070 mobile series uses 5120 of the 6144 cores. The Ampere chips also include an improved 5th generation video encoder (NVENC for H.264 and H.265) and a 7th generation decoder (for various formats now including AV1).

The GA104 chip is manufactured by Samsung in 8nm (8N) which is not quite able to keep up with the 7nm node at TSMC (e.g. used by AMD and also for the professional GA100 Ampere chip).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiI2h0dHBzOi8vaXRzZm9zcy5jb20vd2h5LXVzZS1wb3Atb3Mv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,7 Reasons Why I Use Pop!_OS Linux Distro as My Daily Driver,"Pop!_OS is a popular recommendation for Linux beginners and gamers alike. But what are some of the reasons that Pop!_OS stands out from other Ubuntu-based distros available? Why should you consider it as a daily driver for your computer?

I switched to Pop OS from Ubuntu three years ago and it has been my daily driver since then.

Let me point out the benefits of choosing it as the operating system of your choice.

Reasons to Pick Pop!_OS Over Other Linux Distributions

Note that some of the reasons listed could be entirely subjective to what you want and how you expect your desktop experience to be.

With that in mind let me highlight why I chose Pop!_OS as my main OS over other Linux distributions:

1. Separate NVIDIA/AMD ISO

In case you have a system with Nvidia GPU it is not feasible to make it work using Nouveau (an open-source driver for Nvidia cards).

Well you get a working display but you cannot utilize the benefits of your graphics card.

For instance you will encounter stuttering and performance issues with almost every task that needs to utilize the GPU.

Hence the proprietary Nvidia drivers are the only solution to make things right.

And to conveniently add the proprietary driver out of the box the distro needs to include it in the ISO itself or offer a separate ISO with Nvidia’s latest available proprietary driver.

While you can always manually install the proprietary drivers it is not always a flawless experience.

The procedure should be similar to that of installing Nvidia drivers in Linux Mint for most of the popular Linux distros if you are curious.

Driver Manager | Linux Mint (Cinnamon)

Note that at times you will need to troubleshoot or re-install the correct (or an older driver version of the driver) to use Nvidia graphics properly.

But if you get a separate ISO for Nvidia-powered systems or an Nvidia graphics installation mode (like Zorin OS) it eliminates the hassle of installing Nvidia drivers manually.

This is not just about the ease of use but Pop!_OS always works out of the box with the help Nvidia ISOs offered.

I have had issues with Linux Mint Ubuntu and a few other distributions when I tried to manually install the proprietary drivers. So Pop!_OS is a breeze to set up for my system with Nvidia graphics.

2. Automatic Tiling Manager

Without a tiling manager you need to constantly drag and drop (and move) your active windows to organize them for quick access.

So a window tiling manager makes it convenient to automatically organize the active windows of any application that you launch.

Of course the experience with a tiling manager will differ as per your screen size but even if you have a modest 27-inch size display it should be a noticeable experience.

I find myself using it all the time even without a big monitor (or a dual-monitor setup).

I have never used it on a laptop but at the end of the day having an automatic window tiling manager (that you can enable/disable) sounds like a useful feature.

It helps with enhancing your multi-tasking capabilities without necessarily moving to different workspaces.

3. Ease of Use

Why do you think Ubuntu is one of the best Linux distributions?

It manages to offer an easy-to-use modern desktop experience for years now.

Impressively System76 has managed to polish the user experience in Pop!_OS up a notch on top of Ubuntu.

Hence Pop!_OS is not just another Ubuntu distro but the presence of an application launcher application library dock workspace customizations and various other optimizations lead to a unique desktop experience.

For my use-case it feels better than Ubuntu. Not to forget it also includes some of its tools like Popsicle that comes in handy later down the road.

4. Newer Linux Kernel

Pop!_OS 21.10 featuring Linux Kernel 5.15.8

Ubuntu may not feature the latest and greatest Linux Kernel especially when it comes to LTS releases.

However Pop!_OS tries its best to offer the latest Linux Kernel releases even for the LTS releases. For instance Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS packs in Linux Kernel 5.11 but Pop!_OS 20.04 LTS features Linux Kernel 5.13.

For most users this may not be a big deal but Pop!_OS pushes newer Linux Kernel faster than most other Linux distributions.

If you want your latest and greatest hardware to work well with Linux distros Pop!_OS is a fantastic bet.

5. Application Launcher

Application launcher comes in incredibly handy to quickly launch an app or navigate between active windows.

The ability to invoke the launcher using a shortcut (or maybe a macro linked to it as I use it) makes it one of the quickest ways to launch applications and navigate between them.

Of course you can install tools like Ulauncher to achieve the same. However having it pre-configured and working out of the box without any troubleshooting is convenient.

6. Fast Upgrade Process

Even though upgrading Linux distributions is usually hassle-free Pop!_OS tries its best to refine and improve the upgrade process with every update.

For instance with Pop!_OS 21.10 they introduced improvements that would prevent conflicts in the upgrade process and make it a seamless process.

In fact I upgraded from Pop!_OS 21.04 to 21.10 in a few clicks without any issues.

7. Thrives to Improve the Modern Desktop Experience

Pop!_OS may not be a lightweight Linux distro but it focuses on providing a top-notch experience for modern desktop users.

While there are plenty of good Linux distributions for older computers it is equally important to aim for newer-gen hardware.

Pop!_OS does that incredibly well considering System76 also tests the distribution on latest hardware configurations with their laptops.

In addition Pop!_OS also offers out-of-the-box tweaks that makes things easy for a user in terms of OS experience. While Linux is all about tweaking and taking control of your system Pop!_OS seems to be succeeding in making it a mainstream option and a viable alternative to Ubuntu that could prove to be better for some.

Bonus: Package Updates

System76 has recently switched away from Launchpad to its own repositories with the Pop!_OS 21.10 release.

It should let them push updates faster and take control of packages to ensure the best experience for users.

This should also make the Pop!_Shop more useful. So yet another reason to keep using Pop!_OS on my machine.

Wrapping Up

Pop!_OS does a lot of good things.

And if you are confused with choosing a Linux distro that is easy to use compatible with latest hardware and fits various use-cases I would recommend Pop!_OS.

The above-mentioned reasons are why I stick to it even after I tried switching away to Zorin OS and Linux Mint for a few months.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuZHJvaWRhdXRob3JpdHkuY29tL2Jlc3QtbGFwdG9wcy1ydHgtMjA4MC05NDM3MDAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The best laptops with RTX 2080 graphics to buy in 2021,"Many premium laptop options have moved onto NVIDIA’s 30 series graphics cards which makes now the perfect time to grab an RTX 2080 model. These laptops offer a significant upgrade over their GTX 1080 touting counterparts. While the sheer graphical fidelity might not represent quite as big a step-change as last time what really sets the chip apart is the inclusion of dedicated cores for ray tracing (and other machine learning/AI tasks).

Ray tracing is the real-time lighting calculation that has helped CG movies look so amazing for years. While this isn’t enabled on all modern games (and a GTX 1080 can technically manage the feature in most cases) the effect is only getting better and is likely to become increasingly common and demanding. This makes a laptop with RTX 2080 a solid purchase decision right now.

Here’s our list of the best laptops with the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080.

Buying the best laptop with NVIDIA RTX 2080 GPU The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 was the top-of-the-line GPU from the RTX 20 series. When it comes to laptops however you shouldn’t expect the exact same levels of performance. You will get slightly lower performance with the difference varying according to the variant you pick.

You’ll see two variants of the RTX 2080. First NVIDIA provides a dedicated version for mobile that’s less powerful than the desktop version. The other variant is the RTX 2080 with Max-Q a tweaked version targeting maximum performance at a reduced power draw. It’s built for thin and light gaming laptops whereas the vanilla RTX 2080 will reside in models nearly an inch thick or larger.

If your priority is having a really portable machine with an RTX 2080 inside you’ll be better off with the RTX 2080 Max-Q. You’ll get lower performance though. On the other hand if portability isn’t a huge factor a laptop with the normal mobile RTX 2080 would be the way to go.

Your portability requirements will be the key while picking the best NVIDIA RTX 2080 laptop for you.

The other factors to consider have to do with picking a good gaming laptop overall. You’ll need a great screen preferably with a high refresh rate. A solid CPU to go along with the RTX 2080 is important too. Gaming laptops require pretty much every specification to be on the higher end. As such you’d do well to pick an option with more RAM and storage as well. See also: Best laptop deals available right now!

RTX 20 laptops v/s RTX 30 laptops

Nvidia’s RTX 30 series laptops are already here so as such it’s valid to consider them while making your purchase decisions. The RTX 30 mobile lineup is fairly recent so equipped laptop options are becoming available right now.

With regards to performance you’re going to get more from RTX 30 with other hardware updated to meet the GPU as well. However the advantage with the RTX 20 laptops is that you can get them at reduced price tags as opposed to their original MRP. While the prices of some SKUs are still inflated if you pick well you can get better value for money with RTX 20 laptops than with RTX 30 laptops.

If you want the latest stuff however you’d do well to get an RTX 30 laptop over the RTX 20 ones. The updated hardware will hold up well and the availability to pricing ratio is likely to be better at this point in time.

The bottom line is that you should only be getting an RTX 20 series laptop right now if you’re getting some serious bang for your buck with other specifications like the CPU matching your requirements.

A: NVIDIA RTX 2080 was the flagship GPU in the series and as such it comes at a premium. Laptops with this GPU start around the $2000 mark and can go all the way up to $4000. The sweet spot for these laptops lies between $2000 and $2500.

Q: What’s the difference between NVIDIA RTX 2080 Max-Q and Max-P?

A: As explained earlier Max-Q is a lower-powered version of the GPU made for slimmer and lighter laptops. Max-P is not an official NVIDIA brand but rather a terminology used by laptop manufacturers to denote “maximum performance” i.e. full power mobile GPU.

Q: Should you get an NVIDIA RTX 2080 laptop over a desktop?

A: You’ll get more performance from a desktop with RTX 2080 but a laptop offers an obvious advantage — portability. Desktop GPUs are also hard to find now at reasonable prices so a laptop would make more sense at the moment.

For many swimming in college is a lifelong dream that is pursued with dedication and determination. Fitter and Faster is proud to honor these athletes and those who supported them on their journey.

Cara O’Toole from London Great Britain has announced her commitment to continue her academic and athletic careers at Old Dominion University beginning in the 2022-2023 school year. She has the potential to make a huge impact at the conference level and in school history.

“SO so excited to officially announce that I have been given the most amazing opportunity to continue my academic and swimming career at Old Dominion University . A massive thank you to my coaches family and friends who have supported me throughout the process🤍#reignon🦁🇺🇸”

O’Toole swims for Ealing Swimming Club out of London GBR. In February 2020 she competed at the Middlesex County Championships where she earned long course best times in the 800 freestyle (8:54.50) and the 200 backstroke (2:19.69).

She continued her success into March 2020 as she earned numerous best times while at the Region Spring Open Meet. Those times included the long course 200 (2:07.30) 400 (4:21.27) and 1500 (17:02.57) freestyles as well as the 100 backstroke (1:05.96).

She is a British 2x national medalist Swim England 2x national medalist and a London region Champion. She also was selected to the Swim England London team that was supposed to race in Barcelona before the meet was canceled due to COVID-19 and she qualified for the British and Irish 2021 Olympic Trials.

O’Toole attends Royal Masonic School for girls in Rickmansworth England.

Her best times (LCM/SCM) with SCY conversions are:

200 freestyle: 2:07.30 2:04.89 (converts to 1:51.80)

400 freestyle: 4:21.27 4:17.68 (converts to 4:52.73)

800 freestyle: 8:54.50 8:53.34 (converts to 9:58.87)

1500 freestyle: 17:02.57 17:27.58 (converts to 16:42.51)

200 backstroke: 2:19.69 2:14.94 (converts to 2:01.56)

Based on her best converted times O’Toole has the potential to make a huge impact for Old Dominion at the conference level. They would have earned her a second place finish in the 1650 freestyle a third place finish in the 500 freestyle and a seventh place finish in the 200 backstroke. She would have been the only member of the team in the top eight in the 500 and 1650 freestyles.

She also has the potential to make school history as her best converted times already put her third in school history in the 500 and 1650 freestyles as well as eighth in the 200 backstroke.

Old Dominion University is a public university located in Norfolk Virginia. The school is a member of Conference-USA (C-USA). The team finished sixth out of six teams at the 2021 C-USA Championships. They were led by current junior Tara Enneking who captured the conference title in the 200 IM.

O’Toole will arrive next fall as a member of the class of 2026 along with fellow international student Sadie Goldin.

Fitzgerald was introduced to the game at an early age. He began playing at the Warnersville Recreation Center in Greensboro North Carolina and grew up in a family full of educators and athletes. At a young age his parents inspired him to find something that he found peace doing which was playing football.

After playing at the Warnersville Recreation Center Fitzgerald played Pop Warner travel football with the R&R Dawgs of North Carolina. He also played AAU travel basketball with the North Carolina Cobras.

Fitzgerald grew up playing at James B. Dudley High School where he was a three-star recruit and state champion in 2016. During his time there he was a part of four great teams.

He continued his academic and football career at Old Dominion and had over 20 scholarship offers in high school but the Monarchs just felt like a great fit. Fitzgerald would go on to graduate with a degree in communications.

When the COVID-19 pandemic hit Fitzgerald and his team were unsure if they were still playing. They returned back home and since gyms were all closed the team was forced to get creative with their workouts. They did everything they could to prepare for a season that may or may not have happened.

“Even though we didn’t play a season in 2020 it didn’t put me back but it gave me a new understanding and different appreciation of the game” Fitzgerald said.

His journey into post-grad life provides him another opportunity to succeed at the sport he loves.

“This season I unfortunately faced an injury where I only played in one game this season” said Fitzgerald discussing his eligibility to play again. “I’ll technically be a redshirt sophomore again next year.”

Throughout all of the offers Fitzgerald continued his education and then UConn entered the picture. It was a perfect match. He expressed how this move would help him be able to get a fresh start and create a new image for himself.

One of the popular factors that Fitzgerald along with other athletes took into account was his confidence in UConn football’s new coach Jim L. Mora.

“Honestly UConn was the best fit for me. It was a great feel. I’m a big fan of Coach Mora” said Fitzgerald. “I believed in his vision for the program from our first phone call.”

The football team was also a great choice for Fitzgerald due to the previous chemistry he had developed with some of the staff. Both wide receiver coach/pass game coordinator John Allen and UConn director of player personnel Michael Zyskowski previously served at Old Dominion.

Fitzgerald is a player who is very passionate about the game itself and stated that he’ll be looking most forward to creating bonds with his new brothers this season. In preparation for the 2022 season he will be training with former Huskies wide receiver Geremy Davis in Arizona during the offseason.

Fitzgerald will lace up and get ready to play for the Huskies and coach Mora with a single goal at hand of turning this football program around.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5waWxvdG9ubGluZS5jb20vMjAyMS8xMi8yNS93ZWVrZW5kLXJlZ2lvbnN0YXRlLXJvdW5kdXAtaGFtcHRvbi1oaWdoLWdyYWR1YXRlLWNhdC1iYXJiZXItbWFrZXMtbmJhLWRlYnV0LWluLWF0bGFudGFzLWNocmlzdG1hcy1kYXktZ2FtZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Weekend region/state roundup: Hampton High graduate Cat Barber makes NBA debut in Atlanta's Christmas Day game,"Former Hampton High and North Carolina State standout Anthony “Cat” Barber made his NBA regular-season debut on Christmas Day earning a call-up to the Atlanta Hawks on a 10-day hardship deal.

The items found in a box under a removed statue of general Robert E Lee are not what historians expected

AP RICHMOND US





A rust-colored 1875 almanac a cloth envelope and a silver coin were found Wednesday in a time capsule that lay hidden beneath a towering statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee in Virginia for more than 130 years.

As intriguing as the water-damaged items were they’re not what many were expecting to see after state conservators spent five hours gingerly prying the time capsule open. Even the mortar-encrusted lead box was a bit of a surprise.

Historical records led many to believe the capsule held dozens of objects related to the Confederacy as well as a picture of deceased president Abraham Lincoln. But in just a few minutes its contents were revealed and the items were few.

This book was found in a time capsule recovered Wednesday from Confederate General Robert E. Lee’s monument. Photo: Reuters

There were three books total. Besides the almanac there was a tattered book with a pink cover that appeared to be an edition of The Huguenot Lovers: A Tale of the Old Dominion by Collinson Pierrepont Edwards Burgwyn. He was a city of Richmond civil engineer who worked on the plans for Monument Avenue where the Lee statue had stood.

There also appeared to be a pamphlet of some kind that made reference to water power facilities for the city of Manchester a community south of Richmond.

Devon Henry the contractor who took down the Lee statue and is continuing to work on the removal of the pedestal in Richmond said there could be a second time capsule that’s yet to be found.

“I’m as intrigued as everyone” he said as conservators worked to open the capsule. “It was a huge relief to find it. Secondly we need to see if it’s what we are looking for.” The day after the Lee statue was removed in September work crews spent more than 12 hours searching for the time capsule in the base of the 12m-tall pedestal but were unable to locate it.

A time capsule was eventually found on Friday embedded 6m high in the pedestal. Henry said his work crew is still being extra careful given that the container opened Wednesday doesn’t match the description of the time capsule they were expecting.

A newspaper article from 1887 — the year a time capsule was embedded in the pedestal — suggested that the capsule contains Civil War memorabilia and a “picture of Lincoln lying in his coffin.” Records from the Library of Virginia also suggested that 37 Richmond residents organizations and businesses contributed about 60 objects to the capsule many of which are believed to be related to the Confederacy.

That time capsule was believe to be a copper box measuring 35cm-by-35cm-by-20cm larger than the lead box pulled from the pedestal last week. Besides there being far fewer objects the capsule removed Friday measured 10cm-by-20cm-by-30cm and was made of lead.

“We were really surprised to find something lead” said Julie Langan the director of the state’s Department of Historic Resources.

The team at the state Department of Historical Resources will catalog the artifacts and expects to have more details on their makeup and their possible origins in a few days. The books will be put in a freezer to avoid mold and the silver coin which started to tarnish when the box was open will be kept in a dry place to limit deterioration.

Before the work began to open the capsule on Wednesday Governor Ralph Northam said Virginia doesn’t need monuments that glorify the Confederacy.

“We are a Commonwealth that embraces diversity” he said. “We are inclusive.”

The Lee statue was erected in 1890 and was long seen as a symbol of racial injustice in the former capital of the Confederacy. Its removal in September came more than a year after Northam ordered it in the wake of protests that erupted after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.

The Lee statue was one of five Confederate tributes along Richmond’s Monument Avenue and the only one that belonged to the state. The four city-owned statues were taken down last year but the Lee statue removal was blocked by two lawsuits until a ruling from the Supreme Court of Virginia in September cleared the way for it to be dismantled. Northam a Democrat announced earlier this month that the enormous pedestal would be removed a reversal from September when the governor said the pedestal would stay in place so its future could be determined by a community-driven effort to reimagine Monument Avenue.

After Floyd’s killing last year the Lee statue became a focal point of the racial justice movement in Richmond. Since then the pedestal has been covered in graffiti some of it profane and much of it denouncing the police. Some activists wanted to see it remain in place as a work of protest art."

TAIPEI: Taiwan and Japan's ruling parties agreed on Friday to have ""all round cooperation"" on semiconductors and to hold regular talks between each other Taiwanese lawmakers said after what are de facto discussions between the two governments.While Chinese-claimed Taiwan and Japan do not have formal diplomatic ties they have close unofficial relations and both share concerns about China especially its increased military activities near the two.The talks attended by two senior lawmakers each from Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and Japan's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) took place online and follow initial consultations in late August.DPP lawmaker Chiu Chih-wei told reporters that chips were not just an issue for Japanese industry which like the rest of the world has faced semiconductor shortages but also an issue of security in the face of China.""Both sides agreed that in the future there will be even more cooperation on chip supply chains there will be a complete framework a system to have all round cooperation on semiconductors and other industries the two countries put importance on"" he said.Japanese officials said they had agreed with Taiwan side that the two needed to cooperate to build resilient supply chains in areas such as semiconductors. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd said last month it would build a $7 billion chip plant in Japan with Sony Group. TSMC a major Apple supplier produces some of the world's most advanced semiconductors.Head of the DPP's international department Lo Chih-cheng who is also a senior DPP lawmaker added that the two parties agreed going forward their dialogue would become regular.The Japanese side also reaffirmed its support for Taiwan to join the 11 member Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership  or CPTPP Lo said which China is seeking to join too.However Lo said that military issues were not discussed during these talks.Japanese and U.S. armed forces have drawn up a draft plan for a joint operation for a possible Taiwan emergency Japan's Kyodo news agency said on Thursday citing unnamed Japanese government sources amid increased tensions between the island and China.In October Japan's government signalled a more assertive position on China's aggressive posture towards Taiwan suggesting it would consider options and prepare for ""various scenarios"".",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lcXVpdHltYXN0ZXIuY29tL2RldGFpbC5hc3A_ZGF0ZT0xMi8yNS8yMDIxJnN0b3J5PTEmdGl0bGU9U2VtaWNvbmR1Y3Rvci1TdG9ja3MtaW4tSW5kaWEtSGVyZXMtYS1XYXRjaGxpc3QtZm9yLVlvdS10by1UcmFja9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Semiconductor Stocks in India?

May 17 2022 - Semiconductor Stocks in India? Here's a Watchlist for You to Track...

Semiconductor Stocks in India? Here's a Watchlist for You to Track...

Editor's note: Semiconductor stocks are a hot trend in equity market today.

In December 2021 we were quick enough to identify this megatrend and wrote about the top semiconductor stocks.

A lot has happened since we last wrote to you in December 2021. In this updated article we take you through the recent developments.

Continue reading...

If you're looking for growth stocks semiconductor stocks should be the first place you should look.

Why?

2021 and 2022 were good years for the semiconductor industry as demand surged. However the pandemic caused disruptions which throttled supply.

The demand-supply mismatch resulted in semiconductor stocks seeing a sharp rally and touching their all-time highs.

And here's the thing...

There are not one or two drivers of technological advancements where semiconductor chips are proving their worth.

The transformation of auto sector as we undergo an electric vehicle (EV) revolution.

5G rollout.

Smartphones smart TVs and other electronic items.

These were just a few examples but there are more.

As industries rush towards digitization demand for semiconductors will only grow more.

So if you think the semiconductor theme is just temporary and might be over soon think again.

The government has lined up a host of initiatives for local semiconductor manufacturing. Currently India meets its semiconductor requirements through imports.

The demand-supply mismatch is here to stay and semiconductor stocks will make headlines yet again.

The companies involved in this space directly or indirectly are still very few. This can change very quickly and the right pick could be the x-factor for your portfolio.

Recently we wrote about the top semiconductor companies and why they should be on your watchlist.

Top Semiconductor Stocks in India

Company CMP (Rs) 1 Month (%) 3 Months (%) 1-Year (%) 3-Year (%) Tata Elxsi 8119.3 4% 17% 124% 840% Dixon Technologies 3340.2 -23% -20% -15% 640% ASM Technologies 423.2 -28% -33% 287% 822% SPEL Semiconductor 57.1 -14% -9% 398% 808% Moschip Technologies 50.2 -26% -27% 70% 164% Ruttonsha International 238.2 -24% -31% 367% 485% Vedanta 287.2 -32% -22% 3% 79% MIC Electronics 15.6 -12% -30% 1257% 1596% Indosolar 3.9 -29% -13% 97% 131% Surana Solar 23.0 -7% -13% 147% 243%

This list is still extremely relevant today.

While these stocks have the potential to deliver huge gains you should be very careful about which semiconductor stock to invest in.

There's been another major development since we wrote about semiconductor stocks in December 2021.

Companies have submitted plans for setting up fab units (a technical word for a plant where semiconductors are produced) while many have submitted proposals for designing and packaging semiconductors.

Global semiconductor giants are showing interest to set shop in India and giving India's semiconductor plans a much-needed push.

For instance international semiconductor consortium ISMC will invest a whopping US$3 bn in setting up a semiconductor chip-making plant in Karnataka.

Believe it or not developments in this space are happening at a fast pace.

India's Semiconductor Stocks to watch Out For...

The global shortage of semiconductor chips has triggered concerns as companies around the world fail to meet rising demand for a wide range of essential as well as modern tech products.

The shortage has intensified over the past couple of months.

Semiconductors are components needed for manufacturing cars televisions refrigerators washing machines personal computers laptops mobiles etc.

These components are made from silicon and fit into microcircuits that power various electronic goods and components.

These little chips are so important that tens of thousands of workers must get lines that are a millionth of a meter i.e. one micron wide exactly right. Or else it won't work. The semiconductor chips fail.

Semiconductors play an important role in a variety of fields. For example operating air conditioners improving automobile safety laser treatment in cutting-edge medical care and the list goes on.

While making a list of semiconductor stocks in India there were no surprises. Every stock which had even little exposure to semiconductors has seen a sharp rally.

Why?

The buzz around semiconductors started mainly due to the shortage of semiconductor chips.

Another factor driving semiconductor stocks higher is the Indian government's efforts and support.

The government has announced the PLI scheme for semiconductor industry. This scheme is worth a whopping Rs 760 bn to be invested over the next 5-6 years.

The scheme aims to boost the semiconductor and display manufacturing in India. It will position the country as a global hub for hi-tech production Semiconductor demand in India is most likely to outstrip supply in near future.

As part of the scheme apart from big companies the government will also incentivise startups to design and make semiconductors.

While there are not many companies involved directly in manufacturing semiconductor chips in India there are some indirect plays.

Let's take a look at listed Indian companies engaged in the semiconductor industry.

#1 Tata Elxsi

It was in August this year when the Tata group showcased its ambitious plan to foray into semiconductor manufacturing.

The company's chairman N Chandrasekaran said the group has already pivoted into a number of new businesses like electronics manufacturing 5G network equipment as well as semiconductors.

The Tata group is in talks with at least three state governments in India to invest US$300 m towards a new semiconductor assembly and testing unit. The states are Tamil Nadu Karnataka and Telangana.

The group is also in talks with major international companies including those from Taiwan for its semiconductor chip business.

Tata Elxsi which is a Tata group company is already into the business of semiconductor services that includes artificial intelligence tools and frameworks design solutions and development.

Note that this foray will help the Tata group supply semiconductor chips and other components to Tata Motors and Tata Power apart from other companies across the world.

#2 Dixon Technologies

Dixon Technologies is the biggest manufacturer of LED TVs in India producing TVs for brands like Samsung Panasonic Xiaomi TCL OnePlus and many more. They also manufacture lighting products for companies like Philips Havells Syska Bajaj Wipro Orient and more.

In 2020 the company forayed into information & communications technology (ICT) hardware including laptops desktops tablets and servers and set up a factory in South India.

As chips are quite important for TVs and other electronics which Dixon makes it could set up a chip manufacturing plant in the future.

However the company's CFO said in 2021 that it has no ready plans for now as a chip manufacturing plant is a high capital expenditure investment of US$4-5 m.

To know more about the company check out Dixon Technologies' financial factsheet and latest quarterly results.

#3 ASM Technologies

ASM Technologies provides consulting and product development services in the areas of engineering services and product R&D.

The main clients of ASM Technologies include reputed customers involved in manufacturing of semiconductor equipment and network devices.

As the pace of technological advancement has been very high in these industries the company's clients invest significantly in R&D to stay ahead of competition. This results in recurring revenues for ASM.

ASM Technologies is in the process of expanding its service offerings and has recently forayed into areas of virtual reality (VR) internet of things (IoT) and open edX platform management.

As the company is closely linked to the semiconductor industry its shares have been on a spectacular run this year.

Over 100% gains came in the month of January 2021. In the year gone by shares of the company are up a whopping 600%.

Surprisingly mutual funds FII or DIIs don't hold any stake in the company. In fact as per ASM Technologies' latest shareholding pattern promoters hold majority of the stake.

Update: Recently the company formed a 50:50 joint venture (JV) with Hind High Vacuum (HHV) to undertake design led engineering and manufacturing of tools sub-systems sub-system components and components for the semiconductor and solar industries.

#4 SPEL Semiconductor

SPEL Semiconductor is engaged in offering electronic integrated circuits (ICs). Its products are used mostly in cell phones computers notebooks and personal digital assistants.

It's facility Natronix is India's first and only semiconductor IC assembly & test facility.

The company's customers are some of the biggest integrated device manufacturers (IDMs) and fabless companies in the US Asia and Europe.

While the company's shares are on a tear this year it has little to offer on the financials front. For the December 2021 quarter the company has posted a loss of Rs 10 m.

This was its sixth consecutive quarter of losses.

Update: When the government invited proposals for semiconductor manufacturing and display plants SPEL Semiconductor registered for semiconductor packaging.

The scheme for establishing semiconductor and display fabs manufacturing facilities was announced last year in December. The first round of applications were invited till 15 February 2022.

#5 Moschip Technologies

Moschip Technologies is a semiconductor and system design company with a focus on turnkey ASICs mixed signal IP semiconductor & product engineering and IoT solutions catering to various industries.

This little-known company has emerged as a leading semiconductor design services company providing various services to clients globally. It has a track record of more than 20 years.

The company has four arms namely Gigacom Semiconductor LLC California USA Gigacom Semiconductor Visakhapatnam FirstPass Semiconductors Hyderabad and Institute of Silicon Systems Hyderabad. Moschip acquired these companies as part of its growth plan to offer the full suite of skillset and expand business geography.

From the lows of Rs 14 touched last year shares of Moschip Technologies surged to Rs 83.55. That's a gain of over 370% in just one year.

After trading in a range shares of the company broke through and gained momentum after the PLI scheme was informed.

Between November 2021 and December 2021 shares of the company gained 85%.

Update: Shares of the company have come under pressure in the past few months amid the broad-based selloff and because of weak quarterly results.

Currently the company continues to focus on semiconductor design semiconductor IP (intellectual properties) and other IoT projects.

#6 Ruttonsha International

This company manufactures semiconductor devices power rectifiers assemblies and semiconductor diodes.

The semiconductor devices which it makes includes diodes rectifiers thyristors among others ranging from 10 amps to 12000 amps with voltage groups ranging from 200 volts to 5000 volts.

In 2005 Ruttonsha International was taken over by Dr Harshad Mehta and Mrs Bhavna H Mehta the promoters of Silicon Power Corporation USA.

Just like other stocks involved in the semiconductor industry shares of Ruttonsha International also saw a spectacular run on the bourses.

Starting 3 December 2021 when the stock was trading at Rs 75 per share it continuously traded in an uptrend and gained over 100% in a month.

Update: The company's one way rally was halted due to the Russia-Ukraine war inflation concerns among other factors which halved the company's stock.

When government invited bids for semiconductor fab units Ruttonsha International registered for making compound semiconductors.

Compound semiconductors are different from silicon ones. While a majority around 80% of the world's semiconductors use silicon the remaining 20% use compound semiconductors.

The company has also acquired 100% stake in Visicon Power Electronics which is in the business of manufacturing silicon carbide (SiC) wafers and power electronic devices through epitaxial process.

This acquisition was done for ease of business operations and widen its product reach across diverse business vertical of semiconductors.

The company has big plans for manufacturing SiC based products in India for which it is setting up a fab unit.

#7 Vedanta

After Tatas the Vedanta group announced to invest a huge sum to make displays and other semiconductor chips in India.

It was announced in December 2021 that the Vedanta group is planning to invest US$20 bn over the next 5-10 years to make displays and other semiconductor chips in India. This investment will be made through Avanstrate Inc. a glass substrate manufacturer in which Vedanta has a controlling stake.

An integrated display fab facility and a separate semiconductor facility will be set up.

Avanstrate is in talks with various states that have experience in electronics including Gujarat Tamil Nadu Maharashtra and Haryana. These states provide incentives over and above the central government's schemes.

Update: Vedanta's investment of US$20 bn is almost double of the Indian government's PLI scheme for semiconductors.

To become India's first chip maker Vedanta is seeking 1000 acres of free land water and power at concessionary and fixed prices among other incentives.

It will form a joint venture (JV) with Taiwan's Foxconn and manufacture semiconductor chips in the 28 nm category.

Vedanta has also proposed setting up a display fab on its own.

Vedanta's core business is mining. But it has ventured into the semiconductor space before.

None of these attempts took off. Vedanta claims it had never shelved these plans and is ready for another go.

It wants to start operations at its display fab by 2024. It also believes its JV with Foxconn can start operations in the chip fab by 2025.

Apart from the above there are few other listed Indian stocks which are directly or indirectly related to the semiconductor industry.

These companies include Solex Energy MIC Electronics Indosolar and Surana Solar.

How India stands to benefit

Note that building a semiconductor ecosystem needs big investments and critical infrastructure to support it. The plants need a continuous supply of electricity and water.

Even a single manufacturing plant can use anything between two and nine gallons of water per day.

It also needs manpower. If we go by estimates the recent PLI scheme could lead to the creation of 35000 jobs apart from one lakh indirect employment opportunities. It could also generate investments to the tune of Rs 17000 bn.

As the chip shortage seems to be far from over and the demand expected to rise India stands to benefit as it has adequate resources water and manpower.

Most emerging technologies have high dependence on semiconductors.

A mobile phone or a consumer appliance or even a vehicle as the pace of innovation increases the use of semiconductors will also increase.

Also in September 2021 India made a deal with Taiwan. This deal allows Taiwan to transfer technology for a chip plant worth an estimated US$7.5 bn in India. These chips would power everything from 5G devices to electric cars.

Meanwhile India will be financing 50% of the chip foundry capex. In addition the facility will enjoy tax breaks and other incentives. This deal is certainly a win-win for both India and Taiwan.

In a recent editorial Co-head of Research at Equitymaster Tanushree Banerjee shared some insights on this topic.

Here's an excerpt...

Currently India imports almost all semiconductors.



Its demand is estimated to reach around US$100 bn by 2025 from about US$24 bn in 2021.



Previous efforts to get companies to invest in the semiconductor space had failed. The complex manufacturing processes requires heavy investments apart from need for supply of uninterrupted clean water and electricity.



India is seen as strong player in chip design. But the companies here have failed to get chip foundries into the country.



The investments in India's semiconductor capacity are expected to grow 4-fold in the next few decades.

Tanushree has identified a tech company in India which is grossly underrated despite its dominant role in semiconductor chip designing.

The company has set up management teams in Taiwan South Korea and Vietnam in recent months seeing the growth potential of this business.

With its disruptive capabilities Tanushree believes the company's future seems far more promising than its past.

The nascent cooperation started earlier this year and will involve Taiwan training Indian engineers. The partnership will also include the transfer of technology and creating a manufacturing hub in the country people in the know of the development told News18.

The Centre on Wednesday approved a Rs 76000-crore scheme to boost semiconductor and display manufacturing in the country in a bid to position India as a global hub for high-tech production and attract large chip makers. The step is aimed to boost India’s ambitions to be self-reliant in electronics manufacturing usher in investments and generate 35000 specialised jobs apart from indirect employment for one lakh people.

While much of the modalities are still to be decided the intent of collaboration between India and Taiwan is clear. The two countries have also created a joint group that is focusing on the creation of a semiconductor manufacturing hub and these groups have already met twice this year.

Taiwan is a world leader when it comes to the semiconductor market and dominates the industry. Its Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company according to estimates accounts for 50% of the global market. According to SEMI the global industry association representing electronics manufacturing Taiwan will remain the largest semiconductor material market in 2020-2021.

Both sides are looking at the possibility of one of three Taiwan semiconductor giants setting up a facility in India that may come up in Gujarat or Maharashtra but this has not been finalised yet.

Amid tensions with China the Indian side has been proceeding cautiously while dealing with Taiwan. But the country’s growing need for semiconductors is believed to be the reason for the engagement with Taiwan. India’s semiconductor needs may grow 50 times from the current level of $2 billion to $100 in the next four years.

The development comes even as there has been increased people-to-people interaction between the two sides. Last year Taiwan’s government hosted mega Diwali celebrations. 2020 also saw spontaneous strong support by Indians especially on social media on Taiwan’s national day. Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen has in the past tweeted about Indian dishes and said her favourite foods are chana masala and naan. She also recalled her India visit what she termed as “memories of a vibrant diverse & colorful country.”

A deal of this size would secure Italy about 10% of the 80 billion euros the U.S. company is looking to spend over the next decade in Europe on cutting-edge manufacturing capacity to help avoid future shortages of semiconductor chips.

Sources had previously told Reuters that the investment size was in a 4 billion to 8 billion euro range. read more

As part of this plan Germany the European Union's largest economy is in the lead to land Intel Corp's (INTC.O) planned European 'megafab' plant although France remains in the running Reuters reported in October.

Intel said it is ""having constructive investment conversations with government leaders in multiple EU countries"" but declined to comment specifically on talks with Italian officials.

""We are encouraged by the many possibilities to support the EU’s digital agenda and 2030 semiconductor ambitions. While current negotiations are ongoing and confidential we plan to make an announcement as soon as possible"" the company said in a statement.

Chipmakers are scrambling to boost output after explosive demand for consumer electronics such as smartphones and computers resulting from the work-from-home trend during the COVID-19 pandemic led.



Meanwhile EU countries where many jobs still rely on industries such as automobile manufacturing are eager to reduce their dependence on semiconductor supplies from China and the United States after recent supply chain problems.



The proposed Italian factory would be an advanced packaging plant using innovative technologies to weave full chips.

Intel and the Italian government of Prime Minister Mario Draghi are discussing an overall investment of $9 billion over 10 years from when construction begins the sources said.

Negotiations are complex and Rome wants Intel to clarify its plans for Italy before formalising a package of favourable conditions especially on jobs and energy costs they added.

If Rome and Intel clinch a deal they will then proceed with the choice of a site for the plant the sources said.

However its Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger earlier this month said he hoped to announce the locations of new chip plants in the United States and Europe early next year. read more

In April the Italian government used anti-takeover legislation to block a planned sale of a controlling stake in a local semiconductor equipment maker to China's Shenzhen Invenland Holdings Co Ltd."

Technology stocks have been far from a sure bet since 2021 began its stretch run in mid-November. Inflationary concerns and fears of rising interest rates pushed investors out of software and internet companies sending scores of prior outperformers into correction territory. Despite the sell-off and the volatility across wide swaths of the tech industry investors have made a bundle of money betting on specific companies and stories. Certain areas of the semiconductor market ballooned this year as demand soared for processors that could speed crypto mining aid game development and connect more devices to the internet. Fintech cloud software and cybersecurity had their share of standouts as well even if buying baskets of those stocks and holding them for the year would not have been a particularly lucrative investment. Here are the five biggest gainers in 2021 among U.S. tech companies valued at $5 billion or more. The list excludes companies that went public this year. Prices are as of Thursday's close.

Upstart

When Upstart held its stock market debut in mid-December of last year the company was valued at about $1.5 billion. Just over a year later it's a $12 billion company. Upstart shares are up 264% since the beginning of 2021 including a gain of 171% over a wild three-day stretch in March. The company uses machine learning to underwrite consumer loans and provides its technology to banking partners who can then better target customers. Revenue in the third quarter soared 250% to $228 million. In addition to rapid growth Upstart is giving investors something that's unusual from a newly public tech company: profits. Upstart has generated earnings for five straight quarters including net income of $29.1 million in the latest period up from $9.7 million a year earlier. Upstart said in its earnings call in November that it now provides technology services to 31 banks and credit unions up from 10 a year ago. In the third quarter the company powered 362780 loans up 244% from a year earlier.

CEO David Girouard said on the call that the company is now moving beyond personal and auto loans and into small-dollar loans for consumers with ""immediate cash needs."" ""Our bank partners rightly feel pressured to better serve low-to-moderate income Americans and we want to help them do that right"" Girouard said. ""The interest in the small dollar product from our bank and credit union partners is off the charts and we hope to bring it to market before the end of 2022.""

Synaptics

Synaptics was founded in 1986 and went public 16 years later. But it took until 2020 for investors to start getting excited about the stock. This year it took off soaring 189%. Synaptics grew up in the heart of Silicon Valley developing touchpads and scroll pads for PCs as well as biometrics. Its touch technology then gained resonance with smartphones. Now with more devices acting like computers Synaptics has positioned itself at the center of the ""Internet of Things"" (IoT) boom. The company's technology can be found in connected cars virtual reality headsets set-top boxes drones and gaming systems. It focuses on low-power consumption for all sorts of wireless devices. ""We've done really really well with that business — it's outperformed our best expectations"" CEO Michael Hurlston told CNBC's Jim Cramer in July. ""I think it's because we didn't go after what everybody else was chasing. We repositioned it to go after an interesting market that has turned out to be a great grower."" Earlier this month Synaptics completed its $549 million acquisition of DSP Group which provides voice processing and wireless chipsets.

Asana

Asana CEO Dustin Moskovitz Asana

At its peak in mid-November Asana was up almost five-fold for the year far outpacing all other U.S. tech stocks. It's lost almost half its value since then falling alongside a bunch of other high-priced cloud software stocks. Still the provider of software that helps marketing operations and sales teams manage projects and collaborate remotely is up 164% in 2021 driven by year-over-year revenue growth of at least 70% in the second and third quarters. Like Upstart Asana went public in 2020 but its coming-out party with investors took a few months to get rolling. Dustin Moskovitz the company's billionaire co-founder and CEO has been buying along the way. Moskovitz has purchased about $293 million worth of Asana shares in December taking advantage of the dip to bolster his position. He now controls about 44% of the company's Class A and Class B combined shares up from 36% before the company's New York Stock Exchange debut in September 2020. Converting free users to paying customers is key to Asana's future growth and profitability. In its third-quarter earnings report earlier this month Asana said paying clients increased by 7000 to over 114000 and said revenue from customers spending more than $5000 annually jumped 96% from a year earlier.

Fortinet

With two straight quarters of revenue growth above 30% Fortinet is expanding at its fastest rate since 2016. A flurry of ransomware attacks along with a more complex security environment created by a sudden surge in remote work led to a spike in demand for Fortinet's technology this year. Shares are up 133% closing on Thursday at $349.02. That's lifted the company's market cap past $57 billion surpassing rival Palo Alto Networks  which is valued at $55 billion after its stock climbed 58% in 2021. Following Fortinet's better-than-expected earnings report and upbeat forecast last month analysts at Wedbush increased their price target to $400 from $350. One reason the firm cited was the company's free cash flow which jumped to $329.8 million from $185.7 million a year earlier. ""In a nutshell Billings growth upside strong FCF and a healthy pipeline should be the trifecta to drive this stock higher"" wrote the Wedbush analysts who kept their buy recommendation on the stock.

Nvidia

Nvidia GeForce Now on iPhone Nvidia

Chipmaker Nvidia was the best-performing mega-cap tech stock of the year. The shares soared 127% in 2021 pushing the company's market cap to $741 billion seventh highest among U.S. tech companies behind the five Big Tech names and Tesla . Revenue growth has topped 50% in each of the last five quarters proving that Nvidia's high-performance graphics processing units remain in hot demand. Within the data center Nvidia's technology bolsters artificial intelligence and data-intensive workloads while gaming systems continue to require heftier processing power. Earlier this year Nvidia released new processors specifically for crypto mining. They've generated $526 million in revenue so far but crypto is proving to be a volatile market for Nvidia. The company said last month that sales of the products plunged 60% sequentially from the second quarter to the third and are expected to be ""very negligible"" in the fourth quarter. Investors aren't expressing much concern. The stock climbed more than 8% after the earnings report largely because gaming processors Nvidia's core business generated $2.76 billion in revenue an increase of 106% from last year. ""We continue to believe the company's long-term prospects are some of the best in the semiconductor industry"" analysts from Piper Sandler wrote in a note after third-quarter earnings. They maintained their buy rating and raised their price target to $350 from $260. WATCH: Nvidia could be a $10 trillion stock one day says Jim Cramer",,,,,,,,,

Check out the hot scams of the week and see how many of them you’ve spotted!

Christmas Giveaway Scams

With Christmas being the season of giving most brands and companies hold giveaway campaigns and sales. However scammers impersonate these brands and send you fake messages with phishing links trying to trick you into clicking on them to claim gifts that don’t even exist.



The phishing links lead to fake online survey pages that state you can claim a gift by completing an online questionnaire. After you fill out the survey you are prompted to enter personal information such as credit card numbers before your “gift” can be delivered.



The scammers’ ultimate goal is to steal your information — they will record sensitive information you enter on these fake pages and use the data to commit cybercrimes: e.g. hack into your bank account withdraw money or steal your identity. Don’t let them!



This week we’ve found 3 Christmas giveaway scams:

1. Amazon – iPhone 11 Scam

We’ve seen Amazon anniversary scams and giveaway scams before and now a new Christmas version has been circulating via WhatsApp:

Source: Twitter

The link leads to a fake Amazon survey page. After you fill it out you are asked to share the link to your WhatsApp contacts and submit personal information. (Don’t do it!)

Source: Twitter

2. Best Buy – iPhone 13 Scam

Fake Best Buy iPhone 13 text messages have been popular for weeks but now scammers have added some extra bits to them to make them Christmassy:

Your cell carrier’s saying MERRY CHRlSTMAS with an earIy compIimentary upgr@de to the lphone13 <URL>

Again the attached link will lead you to a fake online survey page and you could eventually have your personal information exposed. Be careful!

3. Sam’s Club – iPad Pro Scam

Last week we reported on Sam’s Club email scams and we recently spotted a text message version that says Sam’s Club is giving away $250 and that you need to click a link to activate it:

CHRlSTMAS lS HERE! Sams C|ub’s giving you a (1) year membership & $25O. Must be ACTlVATED by 12/18 <URL>

Note: Please don’t submit any credentials here! You will never receive the promised iPad and scammers will have all your credit card details and use them for their own good.

Remember NEVER clicking on links or attachments from unknown sources is the key to staying safe online. You can use Trend Micro Check to combat scams with ease (it’s 100% FREE):

NHS COVID Pass Phishing Scam

As the impact of COVID-19 is on the rise again scams about the COVID-19 vaccine PCR tests and health passports are back and circulating widely. Last week many people have received fake text messages from the National Health Service (NHS) that falsely claim you can apply for a COVID-19 vaccination passport online through the phishing link they provide:

NHS: You’re now eligible to get your NHS COVID pass. You could be fined if you don’t apply. Please visit nhs[.]digital-get-pass[.]com to apply for your pass.

Source: Reddit and Twitter

The link will take you to a fake NHS login page where you are required to enter your name as well as other personal information to apply for your (fake) COVID vaccination passport. Guess what? Scammers can record your credentials and use them for identity theft. Don’t fall for it!



Gift Card / Rewards Survey Scams via Email

Besides text messages scammers also use emails to spread fake survey campaigns. They guarantee you gift cards or rewards or ask you to check shipment details luring you to click on phishing links that lead to fake online survey pages where you could end up exposing your sensitive credentials.

1. PayPal Christmas Gift Card Scams

“Congratulations! Win a $750 PayPal Prepaid Card Christmas Survey.” Did you receive this email from “PayPal”? Don’t click on anything!

2. DHL Shipment Phishing Email

“Your package is waiting!🚚” Posing as DHL scammers try to trick you into thinking that your shipment has arrived so they can get you to click on the embedded button in the email — again that will take you to a fake login page. Don’t submit your account information!

USPS Lottery Scam

Who wants a Samsung Galaxy ZFold for Christmas? Well if you do please be extra careful and don’t fall for this fake USPS lottery email! Scammers falsely claim that you can get a prize if you fill out the survey. Sound familiar? We know what will happen if you click on the button — scammers will steal your personal information!

How to protect yourself

Double-check the sender’s mobile number/email address.

Free gifts or prizes are always a major red flag.

In Italy 93 percent of online stores offer PayPal as a payment method. On the other end of the spectrum PayPal is only offered in 1 percent of Serbian online stores.

The US-based payment method PayPal has become a well-known payment option within Europe. Just last year it was the most popular payment method in Germany and the UK for example. According to the Statista Global Consumer Survey it reaches usage rates above 90 percent among online payment service users in the UK France and Germany.

PayPal compared to other methods

When comparing PayPal to other payment methods it is highly popular. In only 12 out of the 43 countries analyzed by ecommerceDB the payment method had single-digit usage rates. AmazonPay for example reaches double-digit usage rates in only two of the analyzed countries.

Italian stores take the lead

Recent research by ecommerceDB analyzed the vendor side to find oud where online stores offer PayPal as a payment method.

Where in the world is Elon Musk? The internet would sure like to know… This June rumors spread that Musk lives in a prefabricated tiny house with a modest rent of a few hundred dollars a month. But recently a new rumor hit the net: that Elon Musk lives in an Austin mansion owned by Ken Howery a controversial entrepreneur and Trump associate who co-founded PayPal with Musk.

So does the founder of Tesla and SpaceX live in a tiny house or a mansion? Here’s a timeline of the past year of Elon Musk’s living situation.

December 2020: Elon Musk moved to Texas and sold most of his other houses.

Towards the very end of 2020 about eight months after tweeting “I am selling almost all physical possessions. Will own no house” Musk followed through. In early December Musk announced that he had moved to Texas after about 20 years in California and by the end of the month The Los Angeles Times reported that Musk had officially sold four houses. All four homes were located right near each other in Bel Air Calif. and went for a total of around $62 million.

June 2021: Rumors circulated that Elon Musk was living in a prefab tiny house.

This June Musk confirmed on Twitter that his “primary home is literally a ~$50k house” that he rents from SpaceX located in Starbase (part of Boca Chica Texas). He added that the only house he still owned was an “events house” in California’s Bay Area. Teslarati then reported an anonymous tip that the $50000 house Musk mentioned is the Casita tiny house made by Boxabl. While Boxabl did not confirm or deny that the company has dropped some hints that led netizens to believe that Musk really was living in a Casita.

October 2021: Elon Musk put his California house on the market.

November 2021: Elon Musk denied that his tiny house was made by Boxabl.

Feels more homey to live in a small house. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 13 2021

In mid-November Musk cleared things up a tad. “I’ve actually been living in a ~$50k house in south Texas for past 2 years not Boxabl (cool product tho)” he tweeted. “Feels more homey to live in a small house.”

Early December 2021: Musk’s California home sold.

According to a Zillow listing that autoevolution believed to be for Musk’s Hillsborough Calif. home the six-bedroom mansion sold on Dec. 2 for $30.1 million.

Mid-December 2021: ‘TIME’ reported that Person of the Year Elon Musk still didn’t own a home.

On Dec. 13 TIME named Elon Musk its Person of the Year and the first line of his profile read “The richest man in the world does not own a house.” The magazine also reported that Musk still primarily lives in a rental home in Boca Chica Texas. However a few days later that all came into question.

Late December 2021: Rumors spread that Musk was living in Ken Howery’s Austin Mansion.

On Dec. 22 Musk was the subject of what Futurism called a “damning” piece in The Wall Street Journal which reported that anonymous sources believed Musk was living in an Austin Texas mansion owned by Ken Howery. Sources also allegedly told the newspaper that Musk was actively hunting for a new home.

Later that day Musk commented on the rumors telling Business Insider “the WSJ article is false. I don't live there and am not looking to buy a house anywhere” speaking about Howery’s Austin house.

Howery promptly confirmed that telling the WSJ: “Elon does not live at my home he lives in South Texas. He stayed at the house as my guest occasionally when traveling to Austin” as per Business Insider. However some people aren’t eating up Musk and Howery’s claims and are suspicious that Musk is being dishonest about where he really lives.

Who is Ken Howery? He and Elon Musk are both PayPal Mafia members.

Ken Howery is an alum of Stanford University the co-founder of VC firm Founders Fund and a co-founder of PayPal which he Musk Peter Thiel and a few others founded over two decades ago. Since then they have become regarded as part of the “PayPal Mafia” an unofficial group of people who worked for PayPal in its early days before finding other impressive careers in tech as per Business Insider. In 2018 Howery was chosen by President Trump as the ambassador to Sweden.

So where does Elon Musk live now?

Basically the last thing Musk confirmed about his living situation was in his November tweet when he stated that he lived in a non-Boxabl tiny house in Texas. It’s also probably safe to assume that TIME’s Person of the Year profile was OK'd by Musk's team and that profile confirmed that Musk's primary home was his rental in Texas.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmltb3JlLmNvbS9ob3ctcGF5LW5pbnRlbmRvLXN3aXRjaC1vbmxpbmUtd2l0aG91dC1jcmVkaXQtY2FyZNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to get Nintendo Switch Online without a credit card,"Some folks are just a little reticent to store their credit card information on their Nintendo Switch.

Elon Musk has been forced to deny claims he’s secretly been living in a Texas estate worth $12 million.

Now while it would certainly not be abnormal for any billionaire like Musk to live in such luxury Elon has previously publicly declared that he lives a wildly different lifestyle insisting to his followers that he does not own his own house.

He tweeted last year: “I am selling all physical possessions. Will own no house.”

After this Twitter confession the Tesla CEO seemed to have got himself in trouble with now ex-girlfriend Grimes evident in his following tweet: “My gf @Grimezsz is mad at me.”

Seemingly sticking to his promise however after these tweets Musk went on to sell off his nine California mansions for a reported $144 million (£107m).

He sold his last remaining home a 47-acre property in the San Francisco Bay Area for $30 million (£20m) earlier this month.

The space-race entrepreneur had told fans he’s currently living in a '~$50k house in south Texas for past 2 years'.

He said the house was in 'Boca Chica / Starbase' and is rented from Space X.

He is reported to live in a 375-square-feet pre-fab home made by Las Vegas company Boxabl.

However despite actively portraying himself as a man of humble living it was reported that Musk actually spends the majority of time living at fellow billionaire and PayPal co-founder Ken Howery’s mansion.

That's according to The Wall Street Journal who reported that Musk has not only taken an 'extended stay' at his friend’s 8000-square-foot home but has also been in contact with several real estate agents to look for a Texas-based property to buy.

Zillow

Elon Musk and Ken Howery have now come out to deny the Wall Street Journal's claims.

The PayPal billionaire told WSJ via text message: ""'Elon does not live at my home he lives in South Texas. He stayed at the house as my guest occasionally when traveling to Austin.""

Advert

The Tesla giant also directly addressed the claims to Insider saying the story is 'false'.

He said: ""The WSJ article is false. I don't live there and am not looking to buy a house anywhere.""

With what was then considered a bold move Dove gained a place in my heart and in my Target cart for life by offering something money can’t buy–a greater sense of comfort and belonging in the world . Years later an exponentially growing category of inclusive brands like Fenty Beauty and Good American continue to make billions following suit.

While the principles behind Dove’s success haven’t changed there’s never been more opportunity to make the most of them. But even in a world where consumers across identities are 4 times more likely to trust brands that take a stand the power of truly inclusive marketing is too often passed over. Instead brands favor siloed multicultural marketing efforts that slice and dice us into segments and fail to bring us all together or worse attempts to check the box with surface-level visual representation in creative.

However 2021’s most-successful inclusive marketing moments reach for more by ambitiously addressing systemic inequities in ways that simultaneously deliver outsized business results. They show us what it looks like to embrace the reality that multiculturalism is mainstream and a more equitable future is on all of us to create. If you’re nodding your head but still not sure what to do next start with the three simple rules guiding the brands getting it right just by keeping it real.

Solve real problems

As we learned from last year’s black square-mageddon well-meaning expressions of solidarity are no substitute for tangible solutions. With True Name Mastercard masterfully showed up for the transgender community while shedding light on an overlooked indignity many are facing simply for being who they are.

Celebration does not connote elevation. —John Graham

When Lyft partnered with CVS to offer free rides to Covid-19 vaccine appointments for those in need they provided a service that made a powerful emotional connection with everyone as did Dove’s partnership with Phenomenal championing the CROWN Act did the same for Black women facing race-based hair discrimination.

There’s no shortage of real problems for brands to solve. Addressing them in ways that also support business goals naturally aligns with the very thing brand leaders have always been striving for: the ongoing alignment of purpose and profit.

Create real opportunities

Sephora’s campaign featuring “the best of Black-owned beauty for everyone” is one of the year’s most powerful examples of authentic allyship as an effective revenue strategy. Closing systemic opportunity gaps requires bold corrective action not just acknowledgment. As John Graham writes in Plantation Theory: The Black Professionals Struggle Between Freedom & Security “celebration does not connote elevation.”

From PepsiCo’s Dig In Initiative to Budweiser’s Brewing Change marketers are uniquely positioned to take advantage of the proven business case for DEI by using their power to address systemic inequities in ways that authentically honor a brand’s purpose.

Face your real history

By committing to make banking more accessible to Black communities and acknowledging systemic injustices plaguing the financial services industry to this day Citi’s Action For Racial Equity Initiative brilliantly exemplifies what it looks like to champion inclusivity from a place of open accountability. From long overdue rebranding efforts to boldly shifting outdated narratives in favor of a more inclusive reality the opportunity to cultivate a tangible sense of belonging that changes how people see and experience the world starts with facing the truth.

Know your real power

As Andrew Winston and Paul Polman write in Net Positive: How Courageous Companies Thrive By Giving More Than They Take the time for “business taking a prominent role in solving our shared challenges instead of contributing to them” is now. Brand leaders who embrace their opportunity to address systemic inequities with marketing will increasingly outshine those who falsely perceive their power as a burden.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vYWRhZ2UuY29tL2FydGljbGUvc3BlY2lhbC1yZXBvcnQtbWFya2V0ZXJzLXllYXIvYWQtYWdlLTIwMjEtYmVzdC1tYXJrZXRlcnMtbGVicm9uLWphbWVzLzIzODMzODHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ad Age 2021 Best Marketers: LeBron James,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://adage.com/article/special-report-marketers-year/ad-age-2021-best-marketers-lebron-james/2383381 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vYWRhZ2UuY29tL2FydGljbGUvc3BlY2lhbC1yZXBvcnQtbWFya2V0ZXJzLXllYXIvYWQtYWdlLTIwMjEtYmVzdC1tYXJrZXRlcnMtbGVicm9uLWphbWVzLzIzODMzODHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiImh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJ5dDkuY29tL2VuL3ByZy8yNTUxNzTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pepsi Launches Pepsi Golden Retro Special Collection with 3 Limited-Edition Designs Urgent!

From Tomato Sauce flavoured Simba Chips to trying to bring back Chocolate Log South Africans have had some bad food heartbreaks this year.

HP Sauce was also hard to find this year.

With alcohol bans to blame Marmite was also in short supply earlier in the year.

We may be right in the throes of the festive season but some South Africans may still be mourning the discontinuation of favourite food items that did not survive 2021 or food shortages they had to endure this year.

This year saw a number of leading snacks and treats go on the production line for a final time in South Africa while some were at times hard to find.

These are some of the food items that were discontinued this year or were in short supply.

The All Gold Tomato Simba Chips

Under the SaveYourFlavour hashtag this year chip makers PepsiCo which owns the Simba and Lays brands asked customers to choose their favourite flavour between three of their iconic ones; Cheese and Onion Salt & Vinegar and Tomato Sauce. Failing to get enough votes the Tomato Sauce flavour faced the cull. But it was not without many lamenting the loss.

So Nestle's Chocolate Log and Simba's All Gold Tomato Sauce flavour are going to be discontinued?I wish I could buy every favourite to keep them on the shelves but alas all things come to an end eventually. pic.twitter.com/fNX1bewCcY — Natalie (@NatAlleyCat) August 1 2021

This is how South Africans voted for their favourite flavour

1. Cheese and Onion: 539 298 | 4499%

2. Salt and Vinegar: 195 460 | 3700%

3. Tomato Sauce: 110 623 | 1801%

When the company confirmed its discontinuation of the Tomato Sauce flavour it said South Africans have changed their taste preferences over time and are moving away from sweet salty creamy and tangy favourites. It said customers are now moving towards braai flavours such as Shisanyama Chilli Biltong and Chakalaka.

In the same crisps category stock levels of Lays and Simba chips are currently low following frost damage to some potatoes. The harsh weather conditions this year caused a potato supply disruption that has left PepsiCo which owns Lays and Simba with limited capability to deliver some flavours and packet sizes.

""We experienced disruptions in our potato supply due to frost conditions affecting crop yields. Whilst those issues are largely behind us we were left with very low inventory levels entering peak season festive demand with constrained supply as a result"" John Stevenson senior vice president for South Africa foods & beverages at PepsiCo Sub-Saharan Africa told the Business Insider South Africa this week.

Chocolote Log

South African's hearts broke a second time when an attempt to bring back Chocolate Log flopped. South Africans are so obsessed with Nestle’s Chocolate Log that they drew up a petition to bring it back over a year since it was discontinued. In October Nestle said it took note of the petition and although it did not promise it would bring back the chocolate with a creamy marshmallow on a crisp wafer it always listens to its customers.

The petition demanded that Nestlé must return ""the GOAT of chocolate"" or greatest of all time because the world needs ""[t]he creaminess of the marshmallow stuffed with caramelized wafer all coated in glazed sweet chocolate"".

The HP Sauce

HP Sauce lovers had a tough year in 2021 after the much-loved UK condiment disappeared from shelves last year. This came following the end of a distribution contract between Kraft Heinz which owns HP sauce and PepsiCo-owned Pioneer Foods which held the licence to sell the sauce in the country.

Although retailer Pick n Pay managed to bring back the sauce it had scant supply of the product.

The popular brown sauce is named after London's Houses of Parliament. Every year 28 million bottles of the sauce are consumed. With a distinct taste the sauce is tomato-based with molasses and malt vinegar derived from barley.

A shortage of Marmite

Every time South Africa experiences a Marmite shortage it becomes clear just how much they love the the yeast-derived spread. Around June this year consumers reported that they could not find Marmite on shelves. It was not the first time customers had to face such a shortage. Last year supply grew thin too following alcohol bans that disrupted the supply of brewer's yeast from AB-Inbev. The spread is made from a concentrated extract from that byproduct of making beer.",,,
PFE,Pfizer,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMS8xMi8yNS9pbnZlc3RpbmcvY2VvLW9mLXRoZS15ZWFyLTIwMjEvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBQWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uLzIwMjEvMTIvMjUvaW52ZXN0aW5nL2Nlby1vZi10aGUteWVhci0yMDIx?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Albert Bourla of Pfizer is the CNN Business CEO of the Year,"New York CNN Business —

The Covid-19 pandemic is far from over. But life in many ways has returned to something resembling normal for many. That’s in large part because there are now multiple coronavirus vaccines including one from Pfizer.

And that’s one of the main reasons CNN Business has named Pfizer (PFE) CEO Albert Bourla as the CEO of the year. Bourla joins previous winners Marc Benioff of Salesforce (CRM) Target (TGT) CEO Brian Cornell and Chipotle’s (CMG) Brian Niccol.

CNN Business considered several other influential CEOs for this year’s honor including Lisa Su of AMD (AMD) Ford’s (F) Jim Farley Marvin Ellison of Lowe’s (LOW) David Solomon of Goldman Sachs (GS) Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Sundar Pichai and yes Time Person of the Year Elon Musk of Tesla (TSLA)/SpaceX.

But Bourla was our choice for all that Pfizer has done in a year where Covid vaccines went mainstream (vaccine was even named word of the year by Merriam-Webster) and helped stabilize America’s economy — and the world’s for that matter.

“Pfizer did a lot of good [for] humanity and we are very very proud of it” Bourla said in an interview with CNN Business. “Not only were we able to save so many lives … but we are enjoying high levels of corporate reputation right now. People like us.”

Hoping to get Covid pill approved in early 2022

Pfizer isn’t the only company that has developed a vaccine. But the Big Pharma leader even more so than its European partner BioNTech (BNTX) or rival vaccine developer Moderna (MRNA) has become synonymous with the fight against Covid.

The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was the first approved in the United States for 5- to 11-year old kids. But many parents of even younger children are now waiting to hear about when a vaccine might be approved for babies toddlers and pre-schoolers.

Bourla said he understands the frustration of parents who are fully vaccinated but cannot get their youngest kids protected.

“We’re working very intensively on that to make sure we can bring a solution for that” Bourla said.

“We are looking at different doses well below the doses that have been used [for adults and older kids.] We know that it will be safe. What we are looking to see is if that will protect them by giving the lower dose” he added.

But Pfizer announced after the interview with CNN Business took place that it is still evaluating whether three smaller doses of its vaccine will be effective for kids under 5 after finding two child-sized doses were not producing the expected immunity in 2- to 5-year-olds.

In addition Pfizer has developed a pill that could drastically reduce the risk of severe complications hospitalization and death for people who contract the virus. The Food and Drug Administration announced following the interview with Bourla that it had approved Pfizer’s Paxlovid oral treatment.

But Bourla stressed to CNN Business that the pill is not meant to be a substitute for the vaccine.

Ready to launch an Omicron-specific vaccine if needed

The recent rise of the Omicron variant has created concerns around the globe about the efficacy of the current vaccines. But Bourla told CNN Business that he believes its and BioNTech’s vaccine will control Omicron “quite well” especially if people have received two doses and the booster.

He conceded however that it is possible Pfizer will need to launch a new vaccine to specifically target Omicron or any other future variants. Bourla said Pfizer is already developing a shot aimed at Omicron and that he believes it could be tested and submitted to regulators for approval by March.

If Pfizer needs to produce Omicron-specific shots that will not slow the manufacturing of the existing vaccine Bourla said.

“We are aiming for a four billion [dose] annual manufacturing capacity of our current vaccine. And if we have to switch between the two the old and the new we still will make four billion. We don’t expect that we will lose any volume” he said.

Bourla also acknowledged that there are cynics who question whether Pfizer is just trying to make as much money as possible from the vaccine.

After all Pfizer said in its latest earnings release in November that it generated $13 billion in revenue from the vaccine in the third quarter and that it now expects $36 billion in revenue from it for the full year.

Bourla told CNN Business that it is charging poorer developing nations less for the vaccine than it does to wealthier countries. But cost isn’t the only challenge. He said some countries such as those in remote parts of Africa are “lacking basic infrastructure.”

“They don’t have centers to vaccinate people particularly in remote places. They do not have enough nurses” he said. “Sometimes they are lacking syringes sometimes they are lacking refrigerators so that they can store the vaccine. So this is unfortunately the situation.”

Bourla is hopeful the World Health Organization and the public-private vaccine alliance Gavi will be able to help resolve some of these issues. He also said the company is looking into drone delivery more to ensure that people get the vaccine more quickly.

“We are doing everything we can to find ourselves on the right [side] of history” he said.

Bourla also continued to stress that the vaccine is safe and that the only way for life to return to normal is for people to get the shots.

“I don’t see any reason why next year will not be a normal year if we do the simple things that are available for us” Bourla said. “If we have very big numbers of people that don’t want to do a third dose or don’t want to vaccinate at all that’s a problem.”

More to Pfizer than the Covid vaccine

Pfizer and Bourla aren’t resting on their laurels.

The company has also been at the forefront of developing many other promising blockbuster drugs such as blood thinner Eliquis breast cancer treatment Ibrance and rheumatoid arthritis pill Xeljanz as well as the Prevnar family of pneumonia vaccines.

Bourla is fully aware that for a drug company to remain successful it has to have even more promising drugs in the pipeline.

Several of Pfizer’s current top sellers are due to lose patent protection in the next few years. Once they expire that opens the door for cheaper generic drugs to compete with them.

That’s a big reason why Pfizer announced plans for a nearly $7 billion deal earlier in December to acquire Arena Pharmaceuticals (ARNA) a company developing drugs to treat immuno-inflammatory diseases. The acquisition came just one month after Pfizer completed a more than $2 billion purchase of cancer drug maker Trillium Therapeutics.

“It’s challenging to multitask” Bourla said. “But let’s not forget what else we are working on. There are so many medicines for cancer for other infectious diseases for cardiovascular diseases for other diseases.”

“We are heavily invested right now in cancer” Bourla added. “The biggest percentage of our R&D investment goes into oncology right now.”

Investors have rewarded Pfizer which ironically enough was booted from the venerable Dow Jones Industrial Average in 2020 just a few months before its vaccine was approved. Shares are up nearly 65% in 2021 — more than any Dow stock — and are not far from a record high.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vZ2gudXNlbWJhc3N5Lmdvdi91bml0ZWQtc3RhdGVzLWRvbmF0ZXMtMS03LW1pbGxpb24tcGZpemVyLWNvdmlkLTE5LXZhY2NpbmVzLXRvLWdoYW5hMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,United States Donates 1.7 Million Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccines to Ghana,"We’re sorry this site is currently experiencing technical difficulties.

At the time of the lawsuit it was estimated that one in nine South Africans had contracted HIV and the cost of providing the patent-protected medication was largely out of reach to the 4.7 million people in the country who needed it.

Defending his decision to bypass the WTO's agreement protecting intellectual property Nelson Mandela said in a TV interview: ""I think the pharmaceuticals are exploiting the situation that exists in countries like South Africa — in the developing world — because they charge exorbitant prices which are beyond the capacity of the ordinary HIV/AIDS person. That is completely wrong and must be condemned.""

""The government is perfectly entitled in facing that situation to resort to generic drugs and it is a gross error for the companies for the pharmaceuticals to take the government to court"" Mandela continued.

In deciding to ignore patent laws Mandela made a moral decision that saving lives was more important than protecting private property rights. The pharmaceutical companies argued back that if developing countries could effectively steal their medicines they would have less incentive to research new drugs in the future that could also save millions of lives.

Twenty-three years later history is repeating itself. In October of 2020 South Africa and India noticed that the overwhelming amount of pre-purchasing agreements for COVID-19 vaccines were being negotiated by rich countries meaning those countries would get the vaccine first. The two nations went to the World Trade Organization and asked for a temporary suspension on patents for all COVID-related medicines and technologies so that the developing world could produce vaccines on its own without having to rely on handouts from COVAX or donations from rich countries.

It turns out they were right to worry. According to the New York Times COVID data tracker 74% of all COVID-19 vaccines have gone to upper and middle income countries while less than 1% have gone to low-income countries. More booster shots have been administered in rich countries than single shots given in poor ones. All the while lower-middle income countries have suffered the highest estimated excess death rate from the virus.

The pharmaceutical lobby instantly lashed out against South Africa and India's proposal. Among their arguments was that even if they surrendered their patents there weren't enough manufacturers in the developing world to make the vaccines — and they argued that even if there were it would take ages for the technical transfers necessary to get them up and running. That likely isn't true: this week Doctors Without Borders identified 120 manufacturers in Asia Africa and Latin America with the technical requirements and quality standards needed to produce mRNA vaccines.

But putting technical arguments of who-can-do-what aside a bigger question is not who should be allowed to produce the vaccine — but who has the moral right to own it in the first place.

The COVID vaccines used in high-income countries were developed largely — in some cases entirely — with public funding. The AstraZeneca vaccine was invented at the Jenner Institute at Oxford University with 99% of public funding. Moderna received 100% of its funding for the vaccine from Operation Warp Speed and the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was funded with almost half a billion dollars from the German government. Pharmaceutical companies have also invested huge sums of their own money in vaccine development without which they would not have been able to bring about the vaccines so quickly.

But let's pretend that the public invested nothing and it was only a small handful of multinational pharmaceutical companies that took the risk and invested millions of dollars to develop the vaccines. Surely the pharma companies are entitled to a reward for their investment and the great service they are providing humanity by supplying life-saving medicine.

But how much should that reward be? Is a couple of million enough? How about a few billion? Pfizer has said it will make $33.5 billion in revenue from sales of its vaccine this year. Even after taking out a chunk that pharma companies say will be reinvested for the development of new medicines Pfizer's shareholders are left with billions to line their Christmas stockings.

Western society has long enshrined the right to private property; as the old saying goes possession is 9/10ths of the law. The pharmaceutical companies clearly have the right to sell their property – in this case vaccines – to whomever it wants and at whatever price it sees fit. Yet Western societies are also governed by principles of The Enlightenment among them a right to ""life liberty and the pursuit of happiness."" So what happens when these rights abut? Should somebody's right to ""life"" mean they have a right to take somebody else's private property? Representatives from the pharma lobby would likely say no while global health advocates would probably say yes.

Because I'm home alone with my eight-year-old daughter and desperately trying to avoid watching the first Harry Potter movie for the hundredth time I decided to divert her attention away from the TV by asking her how she would resolve this moral dilemma. She responded in typical childhood fashion: ""The pharma companies are not being very very nice and if sick people need the vaccine they should go to the police and make the pharma companies give them the vaccine."" I suppose that any daughter of a left-leaning journalist is likely to produce the same answer to this ethical quandary but I'd be very interested to hear how the children of Pfizer's C-Suite would respond.

Children are usually quite good at answering black and white philosophical questions that lack nuance. Voldemort is bad Harry Potter is good. Killing people is wrong as is stealing Mommy's white chocolate bar. The public invested billions of dollars. Millions of lives are at stake along with hopes and dreams of getting back to ""a normal way of life."" If pharma companies are robbed of the rights to their private property for COVID-19 vaccines who's to say the same won't happen for HIV or diabetes drugs.

Fortunately for policy makers their jobs are not currently under threat by primary school–aged children. But delegates at the WTO are essentially being asked the same question only with a lot more nuance that can easily derail the central question of how the global community should organise itself to respond to a public health emergency. It's been well over a year since the WTO council responsible for intellectual property agreements was asked to consider South Africa and India's proposal for an intellectual property waiver. So far nothing tangible has happened. If delegates don't know what to do about the waiver perhaps they can turn to their children for advice as their moral compass is apt to be more sound.

Another fun question to ask one's children is how much money the people should give the pharma companies in exchange for taking the vaccine and giving them to poor countries. My daughter said: ""Maybe like five or ten euros."" To her that is a lot of money.

Disney Coca-Cola American Express Bank of America Lowe's and Pfizer faced accusations that they trained employees on certain ""woke"" ideas such as putting ""marginalized"" staff above ""privileged"" staff learning to ""decolonize"" their minds"" and combating aspects of an alleged ""White supremacy culture"" such as perfectionism individualism and objectivity.

These ideas trace back to critical race theory (CRT) — a framework that involves deconstructing aspects of society to discover systemic racism beneath the surface. Current and former employees at American Express told Fox News that the change began after the police-involved killing of George Floyd in May 2020 but the ""woke"" trainings came to light in 2021.

AMERICAN EXPRESS CRT TRAINING URGED STAFF TO ADOPT A HIERARCHY PUTTING ‘MARGINALIZED’ ABOVE ‘PRIVILEGED’

In February a whistleblower at Coca-Cola claimed that the company forced employees to take a seminar teaching them to ""be less white."" The whistleblower posted photos of a seminar giving tips to ""be less white"" including ""be less arrogant be less certain be less defensive be more humble listen believe break with apathy"" and ""break with white solidarity."" The materials claimed that White people in the United States and other western nations are ""socialized to feel that they are inherently superior because they are white.""

Yet Coca-Cola told Fox Business that the slides ""are not part of the company's learning curriculum.""

Coca-Cola President Alfredo Rivera apologized for the situation in March.

""Recently we learned that content accessible through our company training platform did not align with"" being ""respectful for all"" he said.

While this material was not part of the training curriculum Rivera said ""We apologize to those who were offended by this content. We would never encourage anyone to be any less of themselves.""

In March Manhattan Institute Senior Fellow Chris Rufo revealed whistleblower documents from the Walt Disney Company's diversity and inclusion program ""Reimagine Tomorrow."" The program includes multiple training modules on ""antiracism.""

The modules tell employees that they must ""take ownership of educating [themselves] about structural anti-Black racism."" The modules claim that the U.S. has a ""long history of systemic racism and transphobia"" and that White employees must ""work through feelings of guilt shame and defensiveness to understand what is beneath them and what needs to be healed."" Another module encourages employees to reject ""equality"" focusing on ""equal treatment and access to opportunities"" and instead strive for ""equity"" focusing on ""the equality of outcome.""

PFIZER SETS RACE-BASED HIRING GOALS IN THE NAME OF FIGHTING ‘SYSTEMIC RACISM’ ‘GENDER EQUITY CHALLENGES’

Disney did not deny the training but insisted that whistleblowers took it out of context.

Ticker Security Last Change Change % DIS THE WALT DISNEY CO. 105.80 +0.02 +0.02%

""These internal documents are being deliberately distorted as reflective of company policy when in fact their purpose was to allow diversity of thought and discussion on the incredibly complex and challenging issues of race and discrimination that we as a society and companies nationwide are facing"" the company said in a statement.

In August Rufo published internal documents showing that American Express subjected its employees to a series of critical race theory training sessions that encouraged staff to rank themselves on a hierarchy of ""privilege"" and apply that hierarchy in the workplace with the more ""privileged"" employees deferring to staff from ""marginalized groups.""

In the trainings the outside consulting firm Paradigm urged Amex employees to construct their own intersectional identities mapping their ""race sexual orientation body type religion disability status age gender identity [and] citizenship"" on an official company worksheet. Employees could then determine whether they have ""privilege"" or are members of a ""marginalized group."" Whites males heterosexual people Christians able-bodied people and citizens would presumably count as ""privileged.""

The training sessions also warned White employees to avoid certain phrases such as ""I don't see color"" ""We are all human beings"" and ""Everyone can succeed in this society if they work hard enough"" as ""microaggressions.""

In a high-profile ""anti-racism"" event Amex executives invited Khalil Muhammad a great-grandson of Nation of Islam founder Elijah Muhammad to speak on ""race in corporate America."" He argued that capitalism was founded on racism and that ""racist logics and forms of domination"" have shaped Western society since at least the Industrial Revolution. He even argued that the credit card company should reduce standards for Black customers and sacrifice profits in the interest of race-based reparations.

""If American Express cares about racial justice in the world it can’t simply say the market’s going to define how we price certain customers who happen to come from low-income communities"" he said. ""If you want to do good then you’re going to have to set up products and [product] lines that don’t maximize profit.""

AMERICAN EXPRESS ENGAGES IN ‘REVERSE DISCRIMINATION’ AGAINST WHITE PEOPLE CURRENT AND FORMER EMPLOYEES SAY

In September five current and former AmEx employees — speaking on condition of anonymity — told FOX Business that the company singles out Black people for promotion in a practice that former employees described as reverse discrimination against White people. The employees did not present internal documents to demonstrate an official policy but they said they witnessed a worrisome trend that raises questions about racial discrimination in promotion. One former employee said they quit because the critical race theory trainings and the apparent promotion of employees due to skin color sent the message that White employees could not expect to even be considered for promotion.

American Express denied this accusation in a statement.

""We have a high-achieving culture and we are proud of our dedicated and highly engaged colleagues"" an American Express spokesperson told FOX Business. ""Advancement within our company is based solely on individual business and leadership performance. Any characterization of our company and culture to the contrary is just plain wrong.""

The statement also claimed that the company's ""diversity equity and inclusion programs"" focus on upholding a commitment to ""a diverse and inclusive culture where all colleagues feel welcome and heard and have equal opportunities to thrive regardless of their gender race ethnicity age religion sexual orientation and nationality."" The programs ""are not based on any specific theory nor are they directed to a specific group of employees.""

In August Rufo revealed documents showing that Bank of America Lowe's and Truist Financial Corporation sponsored a United Way critical race theory ""Racial Equity 21-Day Challenge"" claiming that America is systemically and institutionally racist encouraging participants to ""decolonize"" their minds and get ""woke at work"" and urging white people to ""cede power to people of color.""

The Racial Equity 21-Day Challenge included a document with responses to potential objections. Should participants ask about reverse discrimination the guide claims that there is no such thing. The document also claims that people of color cannot be racist: ""Racism is used to justify the position of the dominant group White people in this case and to uphold White supremacy and superiority. Everyone can be biased and engage in bigoted and belittling behavior that is intolerant of other perspectives. But racism is by definition a form of oppression exercised by the dominant racial group (Whites).""

BANK OF AMERICA LOWE'S SPONSORED CRT TRAINING URGING WHITES TO ‘CEDE POWER TO PEOPLE OF COLOR’

Bank of America spokesman Bill Haldin told FOX Business that his company does not endorse these ideas and that it does not run its own employee trainings along these lines.

""This was not our program and not our training materials"" he said. ""The United Way ran this program independent of Bank of America and it is not part of our training material.""

Lowe's and Truist Financial did not respond to FOX Business' request for comment.

The pharmaceutical company Pfizer has set goals to fill a percentage of leadership positions with Black and Hispanic candidates by the year 2025 in the name of fighting ""systemic racism."" In September FOX Business reported on an Environmental Social & Governance (ESG) Report 2020  published in March 2021 in which Pfizer set ""opportunity parity goals"" for 2025. Those goals include ""increasing our minority representation from 19% to 32% and doubling the underrepresented population of African Americans/Blacks and Hispanics/Latinos.""

The report includes a letter from Albert Bourla Pfizer's chairman and CEO in which Bourla says he is ""proud"" of having ""set concrete goals to address systemic racism and gender equity challenges by reviewing and augmenting our plans to increase diversity and opportunity parity by 2025 particularly focusing on increasing female and U.S. minority representation at leadership levels.""

""We now have quotas basically in hiring and promotions"" explained a current Pfizer employee who spoke with FOX Business on condition of anonymity. The employee said the company hosted events with Ibram X. Kendi and encouraged employees to read books written by Robin DiAngelo two prominent CRT proponents.

Sittenfeld corruption case: Federal appeals court hears arguments Thursday,"CINCINNATI (WXIX) - Attorneys for former Cincinnati City Council member P.G. Sittenfeld returned to a federal courtroom Thursday to try to overturn his convictions for bribery and attempted extortion.

A three-judge panel with the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments from his attorneys and then federal prosecutors.

No decision is expected anytime soon.

Sittenfeld 39 of East Walnut Hills is one of three former Cincinnati council members arrested in 2020 and convicted on federal public corruption charges in a series of cases federal authorities launched in 2017.

At the time of his arrest Sittenfeld was the front-runner in the mayor’s race and repeatedly received the most votes in city council elections.

Sittenfeld rejected a plea deal before his trial that would have limited his punishment if found guilty from probation only to two years or less in prison court records show.

The jury did find him not guilty on four of the six total charges. Those were two counts of honest services wire fraud and one count each of bribery and extortion.

Last year U.S. District Court Judge Douglas Cole rejected Sittenfeld’s request to throw out his convictions and get a new trial.

Sittenfeld failed to present “any persuasive arguments” supporting either motion the judge wrote in his 26-page order.

Judge Cole sentenced Sittenfeld to 16 months in prison and one year of supervised release once he’s out.

In early January Sittenfeld reported to a prison in northeastern Kentucky. Federal Correction Institution of Ashland is a minimum-security prison about 2.5 hours away from Cincinnati.

It was listed as one of America’s “10 Cushiest Prisons” by Forbes magazine.

Federal prosecutors say Sittenfeld promised to support perform “official acts” and “deliver the votes” to help the development of a property with sports betting at 435 Elm Street across from the Duke Energy Convention Center in downtown Cincinnati in exchange for $20000 in donations to his political action fund (PAC) federal court records show.

His indictment alleged he solicited the money in exchange for his support to develop the Elm Street property which former Cincinnati Bengals player turned developer Chinedum Ndukwe envisioned as a hotel and office complex with apartments and a restaurant.

“This was not a single event one-off deal or momentary lapse in judgment” federal prosecutors wrote in his sentencing memo.

“Sittenfeld’s actions were part of a broader strategy to use his position of power within local government and his prospects for higher office to extract financial contributions out of individuals who regularly conducted city business. In doing so Sittenfeld made clear that his support for their city business was tied directly to their contributions to him. This is not faithful public service or even “politics as usual”—this is corruption.”

Sittenfeld’s federal trial attorneys however have repeatedly said that his indictment actually proved he did not commit a “quid pro quo.”

He has always been pro-development they noted contending his actions (raising money for future campaigns) are all perfectly legal and this is typical business conducted by politicians.

Sittenfeld’s lead appellate attorneys are Yaakov Roth and James Burnham.

Burnham is a Washington D.C. attorney considered an expert in federal corruption law because he successfully represented former Virginia Governor Robert F. McDonnell in McDonnell v. United States.

That case was a major challenge to the scope of the Federal corruption laws because the 2016 ruling narrowed the legal definition of public corruption and made it harder for prosecutors to prove that a political official engaged in bribery.

In 2017 then-President Donald Trump appointed Burnham as Special Assistant to the President and Senior Associate Counsel to the President.

Now in Sittenfeld’s appeal Burnham and Roth argue that federal prosecutors didn’t show clear and precise proof of corruption the “quid pro quo.”

If Sittenfeld’s convictions are allowed to stand it would bring “a First Amendment Ice Age” where every politician could face prosecution for fundraising according to his appeal.

“The government engineered a sting to see if (Sittenfeld) would accept a campaign donation in exchange for supporting a local development project. To maximize the sting’s chances of success the FBI approached Sittenfeld through one of his longtime existing donors in connection with a project Sittenfeld had already agreed to support” his appeal states.

“Yet despite the choreography Sittenfeld never bit. Over the course of a year-long prosecutorial Truman Show Sittenfeld rejected the only express quid pro quo his friend offered cautioned him on the legal limits around donations turned away contributions that did not comport with obscure campaign-finance rules and even invited two undercover agents to a dinner party with the U.S. Attorney.”

Several amicus briefs also have been filed in support of Sittenfeld’s appeal

Among them are ones from former U.S. Attorney Generals William Barr and John Ashcroft and the top federal prosecutor for the same government office who prosecuted Sittenfeld Carter Stewart. He was the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio from 2009 to 2016.

Sittenfeld’s case they wrote “has two highly unusual features that render it an extreme outlier among campaign-finance bribery prosecutions. First Mr. Sittenfeld’s conduct did not involve the typical signs of wrongdoing that prosecutors expect to see when a public official is engaged in a corrupt enterprise…

“Second the case resulted from a two-year investigation that involved a sting operation specifically intended to uncover evidence of misconduct…The result was a conviction for conduct that was not criminal.”

It’s too early to know how or if the 19-month-long strike connects with this lawsuit filed Wednesday in Lucas County (Ohio) Common Pleas Court by Allan Block of Toledo Ohio. He’s the CEO of Block Communications Inc. which owns the PG its Toledo sister paper The Blade as well as Pittsburgh City Paper and other businesses including cable companies and TV stations. His suit accuses others in his family of scheming to sell all of it without his input.

The suit doesn’t mention the PG strike. Zack Tanner president of the Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh one of the unions that walked out in October 2022 said the lawsuit has no impact on the strike.

“The Blocks are no strangers to infighting” Tanner said on Thursday. “If you worked at the paper for a minute or for 50 years you know the Blocks like to fight with each other. No big news there. But our fight is our fight. They can fight internally but we’re still committed to winning the strike.”

Tanner said he remains confident the striking unions will prevail. A National Labor Relations Board judge has ruled strongly in the strikers’ favor he noted and the NLRB’s regional office recently took the unusual step of signaling its intent to seek an injunction that could bring the strikers back to work under their last contract and compel the company to bargain in good faith a new one.

“We’ll have our day in court and we will win the strike” Tanner said “no matter whether the Blocks are fighting with each other.”

In the suit Allan Block seeks a preliminary injunction to prevent BCI from being sold by his brother Pittsburgh’s John R. Block and others who run the company several of whom also live in the Pittsburgh area.

The motion says John Block — the publisher and editor-in-chief of the two newspapers — several times has tried and failed to replace the plaintiff Allan Block as CEO a position he is contracted to hold until 2028. “Now in a last-ditch effort to assert his so-called ‘sovereignty’ John Block has conspired with the rest of the Director Defendants to exclude Plaintiff from the most major decision to ever face BCI in its over 100 years of existence: a full sale of all its assets.”

The privately-held BCI started in 1901 by the Block brothers’ grandfather Paul Block is not currently for sale but the motion says that in January John Block “caused BCI to form a strategic transaction committee to pursue a merger or acquisition of the company.” That committee the suit says excluded Allan Block.

That news and the possibility raised in the motion that this committee making a “rushed and haphazard” sale “will result in significant job losses” was concerning to people who are working for those businesses as well as those who are on strike especially at a time when newspapers specifically and media in generally are struggling.

The Block family’s struggle for control of BCI looks to play out in court as does the strikers’ struggle for a contract.

The motion confirms that Allan and John Block each have a 25% stake in BCI while the other 50% is owned by family trusts that benefit family members.

Listed as defendants in the suit in addition to BCE and John Block are William Block Jr. exempt and non-exempt trusts Donald G. Block exempt and non-exempt trusts Karen D. Johnese exempt and non-exempt trusts Barbara L. Block exempt and non-exempt trusts Block Family trust No. 2 Karen Johnese Diana Block Ron Davenport Nancy Reid and Emily Escalante.

Donald Block who lives in Fox Chapel in February was named president of Pittsburgh City Paper after it was purchased by a BCI subsidiary.

Meanwhile workers in four production unions went on strike at the Post-Gazette in October 2022 over a dispute that left them without health care coverage. Journalists in the Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh joined them later in their own unfair labor practices strike which is now in its 19th month. The Guild’s issues go back farther than that in that the union’s last contract expired in 2017 and in 2020 the PG citing an impasse in contract bargaining imposed conditions including a company health plan on the workers.

In April the striking journalists learned that the regional office of the National Labor Relations Board had received approval from the NLRB to seek an injunction in their case in which a NLRB administrative law judge had in January 2023 ruled strongly in favor of the union. The judge ruled that the company had to bring the strikers back to work under their last contract and bargain a new one. The company appealed that decision and the appeal has yet to be heard by the NLRB. The union is expecting the regional NLRB office to file the injunction — called a 10(j) injunction — any day now but until it is doesn’t know the scope of what the NLRB wants a judge to order.

It’s a complicated situation and one with many moving and not moving parts.

Also in April one union the distribution workers ended its strike with the PG agreeing to do so and dissolve their union in exchange for severance payments.

The remaining unions still on strike have stressed that the Post-Gazette could settle with them at any time. The most recent actual bargaining sessions that the Pittsburgh Union Progress knows about and attended were in September of 2023. (One union met with company representatives in February to set bargaining dates but the Union Progress doesn’t know if any subsequent sessions happened.)

The Blocks’ commitment to the Post-Gazette is unclear though John Block said on Wednesday in a statement to The Blade that he remains “committed” to the PG as well as The Blade.

In a brief statement given to The Blade and other outlets a representative of Allan Block seemed to contradict that writing “It is unfortunate that certain Block family members would choose to further enrich themselves at the expense of local jobs and the communities that depend on local news coverage.”

Phone calls and messages from the Pittsburgh Union Progress to Allan Block John Block and Donald Block seeking interviews or comments about the lawsuit and the strike were not returned.

A small contingent of striking journalists went to John Block’s home on Wednesday and he was not home so a small group returned on Thursday evening. A man who answered the door said Block was not home and that the group could try again Friday.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpbmNpbm5hdGkuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvMjAyNC8wNS8wOS9wZy1zaXR0ZW5mZWxkLWFwcGVhbHMtYnJpYmVyeS1leHRvcnRpb24tY29udmljdGlvbnMvNzM2MjY1NjAwMDcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PG Sittenfeld appeal: What's criminal when it comes to campaign contributions?,"No commitment required.

Getting a star athlete on a video call for a reasonable fee was an easy sell to fans but not to the athletes—the company had so many athlete no-shows for calls that the effort was scuttled by constant refunds.

He has higher hopes for his second athlete venture: Finlete which keeps the fan meet-and-greet of the first effort but adds what should be a stronger motivator—more money.

“Finlete is a platform that allows fans to support for now minor league baseball players” Connolly said in a phone call. “And with the current amount of money that these athletes make in the minor leagues there’s a really interesting potential return that people participating in Finlete can see.”

Finlete is a new entry in the increasingly popular financial play of athlete investing in which funds swap an upfront payment to an aspiring pro in exchange for a fixed percentage cut of future sports income. Comcast owns 7% of Finlete’s business while famed venture capitalist Tim Draper has a $50000 seed investment in the endeavor.

For Finlete Connolly sees a lot of potential in farm team ballplayers partly because minor league baseball pays most players badly. Finlete’s first athlete Texas Rangers middle infield prospect Echedry Vargas signed with the club out of the Dominican Republic in 2022 for a $10000 bonus–the minimum at the time according to Connolly. Right now Vargas plays in A-ball where salaries max out at $27300. “He’s like a minimum wage guy … but outperforming players that signed for millions of dollars” the executive said.

Finlete is taking a crowd-funding approach selling shares in a Securities & Exchange Commission-registered offering to retail investors. Investors can buy shares in Vargas for $8 (with a 12-share minimum) with the player receiving a $500000 advance. In exchange investors get a claim of 10% of his baseball earnings for the next 25 years if he makes The Show or even if he ends up off-Broadway so to speak in the top pro leagues of Japan Korea and Taiwan according to the player agreement disclosed as part of the offering. If he fails to make the majors stateside or in Asia Vargas won’t owe anything. The offering is still raising money and has about $26000 in commitments according to the Finlete website.

The presence of smart money suggests there’s increasing traction with the idea of swapping a lump sum of cash now for a cut of athlete income later on. The current wave of start-ups was sparked by the initial success of Big League Advance a private fund that is best known for striking a deal with the now-superstar Fernando Tatis Jr. when he was a minor leaguer. Finlete joins the golf pro-focused Commonwealth Sports NFL player-backing Vestible and international soccer player investing Nordensa—which isn’t available to American investors—as more recent entrants to the budding scene.

Conscious of the other competitors in the space the company sees the carryover of the original Cameo-like idea as a key to drawing in fan investors; part of the pitch to athletes too is to build a cadre of supporters early. In Vargas’ case he commits to things such as signing 100 autographs annually and holding meet-and-greets with fans at games as perks to people buying a minimum number of shares and at least two 30-minute video-chat appearance annually under the deal.

“It’s like a PG version of OnlyFans” Connolly said. “You’re involved with the athlete on an intimate level. You get to be a part of the athlete’s journey you get to hear what they’re struggling with and what they’re working on.”

Such a relationship is also potentially lucrative for Finlete. If the current share offering in Vargas’ future income sells its maximum proposed level of $800000 (100000 shares) $300000 goes to cover the offering costs and reimbursements to Finlete. It’s not quite a fair comparison because certain costs aren’t proportional but a typical stock IPO sees about 5% of proceeds directed to expenses and commissions. Finlete also gets the right of first refusal to buy any future baseball-related income Vargas might consider selling.

“We want to do $100 million in revenue in two years. We want to create a trading platform that allows fans to buy and sell their positions … and have over 100 athletes on our platform from Nascar drivers to horse racing jockeys to baseball players and UFC fighters” Connolly said.

That’s a lot of hope riding on the shoulders of Vargas who is currently batting .227 for the Down East Wood Ducks of the Carolina League.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vYmxlYWNoZXJyZXBvcnQuY29tL2FydGljbGVzLzEwMTIwNTMzLW5iYS10cmFkZS1ydW1vcnMtY2otbWNjb2xsdW0tbm90LXVudG91Y2hhYmxlLWluLXRhbGtzLXBlbGljYW5zLXBnLXNlZW4tYXMtbGVhZGVy0gGNAWh0dHBzOi8vc3luZGljYXRpb24uYmxlYWNoZXJyZXBvcnQuY29tL2FtcC8xMDEyMDUzMy1uYmEtdHJhZGUtcnVtb3JzLWNqLW1jY29sbHVtLW5vdC11bnRvdWNoYWJsZS1pbi10YWxrcy1wZWxpY2Fucy1wZy1zZWVuLWFzLWxlYWRlci5hbXAuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NBA Trade Rumors: CJ McCollum 'Not Untouchable' in Talks; Pelicans PG Seen as Leader,"Jeff Haynes/NBAE via Getty Images

Faced with the possibility of going into the luxury tax next season the New Orleans Pelicans could going into the offseason trying to cut payroll with several trade candidates on their roster.

Michael Scotto said on the latest episode of the HoopsHype podcast that CJ McCollum is ""not untouchable"" in trade talks but he's considered a ""grown-up in the room for a young Pelicans squad providing stability on the court and a good locker room presence for the team.""

The Pelicans currently have $167.4 million in salary on their books for next season. That total doesn't include cap holds that bring their total up to $199.7 million which is nearly $10 million over the projected second tax apron.

Jonas Valančiūnas who has a $23.2 million cap hold is the biggest question mark for the Pelicans among their potential free agents.

ESPN's Bobby Marks noted the Pelicans have never paid the luxury tax in franchise history and the front office's decision regarding Valančiūnas and Naji Marshall who is also a free agent will determine if the club has the full nontaxpayer mid-level exception of $12.9 million or the taxpayer mid-level of $5.1 million available.

Of the potential trade candidates for the Pelicans Brandon Ingram has been the most-talked about thus far. The 26-year-old will be playing on a $36 million expiring contract next season but his deal includes a 15 percent trade kicker that could complicate any potential deal.

ESPN's Brian Windhorst has cited the Philadelphia 76ers as a potential landing spot for Ingram this summer. Scotto noted rival executives consider him to be the ""most likely"" Pelicans player to be moved because the fit on the court ""isn't ideal"" with Zion Williamson.

Next season will mark the first year of McCollum's two-year $64 million deal he signed in September 2022. The contract has descending salaries of $33.3 million in 2024-25 and $30.7 million in 2025-26 that could make it easier to trade.

The Pelicans have invested a lot of money in this core that hasn't produced great results. They have made the playoffs in two of the past three years but lost in the first round both times. They were swept by the Oklahoma City Thunder this year with Williamson unavailable due to a hamstring injury he suffered in the play-in tournament loss to the Los Angeles Lakers."

Here's the story of the last one — who played 59 years ago,"In 1962 Terry Dischinger still had hopes of playing in the next Olympics. He had won a gold medal for Team USA two years prior and he wanted to preserve his eligibility so he could do it again.

At that time the Olympics only allowed amateur players on its teams so Dischinger struck a deal to play basketball for the Phillips 66ers an Amateur Athletic Union team in Oklahoma. He had been a star at Purdue — an eventual College Basketball Hall of Famer and the youngest member of an Olympic team that also had Jerry West and Oscar Robertson — and he eschewed the NBA to live out his dream.

But when he got to Alabama where the 66ers were based he didn’t like what he saw. Dischinger still wanted to play basketball and he realized that he might have to finally go pro. The Chicago Zephyrs were his only shot; they took him with the first pick of the second round of the 1962 NBA Draft and owned his rights.

Dischinger agreed to join the Zephyrs a nascent franchise in an emerging league but he had conditions. He would only sign if he also received permission to finish earning his chemical engineering degree at Purdue. The Zephyrs acceded.

During that 1962-63 season Dischinger was a part-time player and a great one balancing his time between basketball and his classes. His story rings out now because for the first time in 59 years a new part-time player is emerging in the NBA. Kyrie Irving will walk that line with the Nets this season after the franchise let him rejoin the team last week despite him being unable to play home games in Brooklyn because of New York City’s vaccine mandate; Irving is unvaccinated. Brooklyn’s decision-makers made the controversial choice to bring him back after he spent the first two months of the season in exile.

While Irving’s impact and playing time with the Nets remains to be seen Dischinger was an unqualified bright spot for the Zephyrs. He was one of the team’s two best players in an otherwise dismal season.

“He was a star” Don Nelson the legendary coach and a rookie on the Zephyrs that season told The Athletic. “He was like a modern-day player back then. He had all the abilities. Shoot outside make plays.”

The Zephyrs were happy to have Dischinger a 6-foot-7 forward with a perimeter game. The franchise was in its second season with a roster composed of expansion draft additions and its own draft picks. Walt Bellamy a future Hall of Famer was its first-ever selection but there wasn’t much else. Nelson was still just a rookie and not yet the contributor he would be to five Celtics championships.

Dischinger gave the Zephyrs an outside force to pair with Bellamy’s inside presence. He averaged 25.5 points and 8.0 rebounds and played 40 minutes a game. Chicago won just 25 games that season the second-worst record in the league behind the Knicks but he was an All-Star along with Bellamy and beat out John Havlicek to win the NBA’s Rookie of the Year award.

But he played in just 57 games a reflection of the special agreement he made with the franchise. Dischinger was allowed to finish his education at Purdue and he would join the Zephyrs only on weekends and holidays during the first half of the season. He missed the team’s season opener because it was in New York on a Tuesday.

“It went pretty well” he said by phone this week. “Any time I could get to where the team was that’s where I would go.”

Dischinger lived in student housing on campus in Lafayette Ind. during the first semester of that school year some 125 miles away and even now a two-hour drive. His wife Mary was a teacher at West Lafayette High School. His studies kept him busy during the week and made it difficult to join the team. But he left for Chicago — or an airport — as soon as classes ended often driving sometimes by train.

At that point the NBA played most games in the middle of the week and the weekends. The Zephyrs played on just three Mondays that season. Dischinger didn’t play mid-week games. He skipped the first Friday night game because it was in Syracuse. When the Zephyrs had four games at neutral sites in late November he skipped the first two in Boston and New York but played the last two in New England likely because they sandwiched Thanksgiving.

He scored 33 points in a home loss to the Royals on Dec. 1 missed the next four days — played on four consecutive days with trips to Detroit and Rochester — and then scored 33 points in a home win over Wilt Chamberlain and the San Francisco Warriors.

Perhaps nothing exemplified Dischinger’s difficult and compressed schedule like one particular weekend road trip in early November. He joined the Zephyrs for a Friday night game in San Francisco and played 48 minutes played 45 minutes the next day against San Francisco had 30 and 15 that Sunday in Los Angeles in a win over the Lakers and was back at school when the Zephyrs and Lakers played again in L.A. two days later.

“It was really something because I had to put my uniform on the plane so that when I got there I could go and play and it worked out really well” Dischinger said. “It was really fun for me because I just started playing whenever I could but then I got to play more. Because I played well when I played. It was something … It was just wonderful. Of course I loved playing. The team that I was with all the guys were really good to me. It wasn’t ‘Oh you’re this or that or you’re better.’ It was a good thing that happened. I could be with them.”

While it may seem outlandish now for an NBA team to employ a part-time player Dischinger’s split responsibilities weren’t that odd considering the state of the Zephyrs that season.

The franchise was still new to the league; it was the NBA’s first expansion team in 1961-62. They had gone 18-60 in their debut season and would move to Baltimore to become the Bullets after this season ended.

They played their games at the Chicago Coliseum which was first built in 1899 as a reconstructed prison and refurbished several times thereafter. The playing conditions players found were worse off than the ones they had encountered in college. They practiced at the Coliseum too but the heat was only turned on for games Nelson said though not always. Sometimes the temperature would dip into the 30s Nelson added and practices got canceled.

“I remember seeing my breath in the arena and the breath of everyone that showed up which wasn’t too many people” he said. “It was kind of a crazy season.”

Dischinger’s teammates didn’t seem to mind that one of them was only there half the time for half the season. He played with the Zephyrs for 25 of their first 48 games and then all of the team’s final 32 games. Nelson proclaimed it was never an issue.

“When you had him we were a better team” he said. “But we were a bad team anyway.”

That season turned out to be the best of Dischinger’s nine-season career. He’d make the All-Star team in each of the next two seasons though his scoring averages dipped and then he missed two seasons because of military service.

The thought of it brought a pep to Dischinger’s voice as he spoke in Oregon where he now lives and where he worked for decades as a dentist after the conclusion of his playing career. His rookie season remains one of the NBA’s best. He still ranks ninth all-time for most points averaged by a rookie — a little more than Elgin Baylor and a little less than Rick Barry. The rest of the top 10 are Hall of Famers.

He is most touched it seems by an honor bestowed to him by his peers. He won Rookie of the Year Dischinger said based on their votes.

“Can you imagine that? Me?” he regaled. “I was playing part-time and then I have this. It was really something.”

It also hasn’t been done since. The NBA has professionalized since and the sport has changed in the six decades since Dischinger decided he could be a student and a pro athlete at the same time.

But it will also play out again soon unless Irving gets vaccinated.

His attempt at it will be a lot different from Dischinger’s season. Asked about how a part-time player would fare now Nelson the all-time winningest regular-season coach was realistic.

“I think it’s more difficult now than maybe it was” Nelson said. “There were only (nine) teams in the league back then in ‘62. It would be very difficult now. But if he’s a star player you would be happy to have them.”

Following normal closing adjustments the transaction was closed for cash proceeds of $3.1 billion.

Pioneer Natural initially assumed that its fourth-quarter and full-year guidance will include the asset in financial results. But now Pioneer Natural announced that it will not include any results related to Delaware Basin in its December quarter after Dec 20. This was due to the fact that Pioneer Natural has completed the divesture on Dec 21.

Continental Resources earlier mentioned that the transaction signaling its entrance in Permian – the most prolific basin in the United States – will significantly boost its free cashflows. The acquisition has brightened Continental Resources’ long-term production outlook. This is because Continental Resources expects more than 1000 locations in the area.

The latest deal closure signifies that with recovering crude prices from the coronavirus pandemic's low mark reached last year Continental Resources has taken advantage of closing the accord to ramp up production. The Delaware Basin assets that Continental Resources has purchased spread over 92000 net acres.

Pioneer Natural is representing the deal closure as its prime intention of diverting its entire focus to more profitable Midland Basin assets. Thus in the lucrative Midland Basin Pioneer Natural has established itself as the only large-cap exploration and production pure play.

Senior Communications Manager Karen Crane said that on Dec. 17 customers of KeyBank’s Kresgeville Branch at 543 Interchange Road were notified that the branch will close on April 1 and all customer accounts will be automatically transferred to KeyBank’s Lehighton Branch at 904 Blakeslee Blvd. Drive E.

Crane said no actions need to be taken by the client unless they have a safe-deposit box located at Kresgeville. If that is the case they will need to remove the contents before April 1. KeyBank will provide one free year’s safe deposit rental at another KeyBank branch for those impacted.

“How clients interact with our branches continues to change at a rapid pace and we have seen a steady increase in client preference for digital banking” Crane said. For example transactions via online and mobile banking were already two times the number of transactions completed at a branch office prior to the pandemic and those trends have only increased in the last year.

“While this consolidation is in part a reflection of changing client preferences it is also strategic so that we can make additional investments in this market such as redesigning many of our remaining branches to provide a more engaging banking experience and increasing to the number employees in our branches allowing our teammates to spend more time with customers. Together with an expanded ATM network through our partnership with AllPoint and strengthened digital capabilities we are focused on offering more convenience to our clients and providing them with exceptional service.”

Crane added “As the consolidation process moves forward our focus is on making the change as smooth as possible for our clients and teammates. We do not expect this to result in job losses.”

She said clients will continue to receive the same high level of service they expect from KeyBank at any of their branch locations and also have access to Key’s other delivery channels (i.e. the ATM network Telephone Banking at 1-800-KEY2YOU online banking at key.com and mobile banking through their mobile devices).

“Our branches are and always will be a source of strength for KeyBank and a critical way we differentiate ourselves throughout Eastern Pennsylvania” Crane said. “We want to emphasize our continued commitment to helping our communities thrive and we are proud of our entire team’s efforts in supporting our clients and communities throughout this market.”

This is not the first branch closure since the pandemic began.

BB&T Bank closed its branch office at 330 Delaware Ave. Palmerton and was consolidated into the BB&T Walnutport branch at 500 Main St. A branch office is also located at 2503 Chestnut St. off Route 209 in Brodheadsville.

How much it would cost to buy all the gifts,"When it comes to Christmas most of us are happy to settle with one day of gift-giving and receiving so where did the 12 Days of Christmas carol come from - and just how much would it cost you to give all 12 gifts?

What are the 12 Days of Christmas? How much it would cost to buy all the gifts

While many are familiar with the 12 Days of Christmas as a Christmas carol featuring a partridge in a pear tree you may not know why the time period is significant.

The season actually begins on Christmas Day itself rather than in the days leading up to it which is known as Advent to Christians.

The 12 days from December 25 onwards mark the period between the birth of Jesus and the arrival of Magi known as the Three Wise Men or Three Kings on January 6. This date is called Epiphany or Thee Kings' Day by Christians.

Some families celebrate the 12 days with feast days that fall between then such as St Stephen's Day on December 26.

The lyrics of the 12 Days of Christmas carol

While the lyrics of the 12 Days of Christmas have seen an array of variations over time this is the most commonly known version.

You begin the carol with:

""On the first day of Christmas my true love gave to me""

Day 1: A partridge in a pear tree

Day 2: Two turtle doves

Day 3: Three French hens

Day 4: Four calling birds

Day 5: Five gold rings

Day 6: Six geese a-laying

Day 7: Seven swans a-swimming

Day 8: Eight maids a-milking

Day 9: Nine ladies dancing

Day 10: 10 lords a-leaping

Day 11: 11 pipers piping

Day 12: 12 drummers drumming

What are the origins of the carol the 12 Days of Christmas?

It’s been suggested the song is originally French and its first appearance in English was in the 1780 children’s book Mirth With-out Mischief.

Historians believe that the song was designed to be a memory test of sorts with lighthearted forfeits for those who made a mistake.

The rules were simple; sing all the previously sung lyrics and add the next one but if you couldn’t remember a verse you owe your opponent a ‘forfeit’ usually a kiss or some chocolate.

Theories suggesting the song comes from when Christians were punished for worshiping openly and used to secretly pass on their ideology - is widely debunked.

If you ever find a copy of the children's book it appeared in you may find that four calling birds are not there but four colly birds are.

“Colly” is an old English term for birds as black as coal so they’re talking about blackbirds in the original.

Also some versions replace the partridge with a “very pretty peacock upon a pear tree”.

How much would the gifts in 12 days of Christmas actually cost?

It's safe to say you'd be spending a lot of money if you were to actually gift all 12 presents mentioned in the 12 Days of Christmas carol.

American-based financial services group PNC has been running the Christmas Price Index since 1984 that calculates the cost of all the gifts listed in the song at current market rates.

And for 2021 it seems Christmas shopping has got a tad pricier as it now costs £31087.55 ($41205.58) and £135418.82 ($179454.19) if you add up the cumulative cost of all gifts when you count each repetition in the song.

Whereas in 2019 the figures were £29096.82 and £127075.54 respectively.

The index website states: ""The goods and services in the PNC Christmas Price Index® are far more whimsical of course. And most years the price changes closely mirror those in the U.S. Consumer Price Index.

""This year the approach to PNC’s CPI takes into account the sociopolitical environment brought on by the pandemic by using the Index to provide an analysis of current market conditions while including the impacts of COVID-19 as highlighted by the data.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhdmluZ2FkdmljZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjAyMS8xMi8yNC8xMDkxMjg3X2FyZS1iYW5rcy1jbG9zZWQtb24tbmV3LXllYXJzLWV2ZS0yMDIxLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Are Banks Closed on New Year's Eve 2021?,,,,,,,

How to Create a Dividend Portfolio for Daily Cash

We can do this because most dividend stocks pay out on extremely consistent schedules. Investors love the certainty and dividend-paying companies try paying out in the same week even the same day every three months. That means with a little bit of strategy we can fill our portfolio with income stocks that will time our payments for every day of the week.

Now how this is going to work is through these three videos I’ll highlight those dividend income stocks that will be paying out in the next month. For example today we’ll highlight 17 dividend stocks that will pay out in December March June and September. I’ll show you exactly how I found these stocks later in the video but here you can see that I analyzed almost 400 dividend stocks to find the perfect income portfolio for each and every month.

The goal here is going to be about 60 stocks that will generate a dividend income on every weekday of each month. And the best part not only is this going to be a well-diversified portfolio producing constant dividends I’ve picked the best dividend stocks with a yield over 4%…that’s twice the average dividend yield on the market.

Dividend Stocks for Constant Cash Flow

Let’s jump right into that list then I’ll show you how I put together the portfolio of daily dividend stocks!

We’re getting started with a fan favorite Iron Mountain ticker IRM and one of the best dividend yields on the list at nine percent.

IRM is a records management provider with more than 225000 clients trusting it to store hard copy documents as well as digital transformations and storage. But the real value here comes in the form of the company’s real estate where all this is stored more than 90 million square feet across almost 1500 properties.

The company is set up as a real estate investment trust which means it gets a special tax break if it distributes at least 90% of profits to investors. That means you get that sky-high 9% yield with the stock going ex-dividend about mid-month in December March June and September.

IRM is a great start to our dividend portfolio and has grown its payout by 27% over the last five years.

Now remember the dates you’re going to see here on these dividend stocks are the ex-dividend date. How it works is a company’s Board of Directors declares the next dividend and the ex-dividend date. That ex-dividend date is the first day the shares trade WITHOUT the dividend so if you want that payout you want to make sure you pick up the shares at least one day before this.

The idea here isn’t to jump in or out of these dividend stocks so this isn’t going to matter as much to you long-term investors. Just put the stock in your portfolio and you’ll get that dividend every time it comes around.

Next on the list of daily dividend stocks powerhouse Altria Group ticker MO and its 8.8% dividend.

Now if you’re set against investing in some of these vice stocks then you can always substitute out another dividend payer that goes ex-dividend around the same time but for yield and dividend certainty it’s hard to beat Altria.

Besides owning the dominant tobacco brand in the U.S. and a dividend that has grown by 53% over the last five years Altria has some key investments that will help it grow. The company holds a 10% stake in the world’s largest brewer Anheuser-Busch and a 45% stake in cannabis giant Cronos Group. So you’ve got very stable cash flow from the tobacco and alcohol segments and that moonshot potential in cannabis.

Altria is one of the later stocks to go ex-dividend on our list late in December March June and September. That means you’ll usually get your dividend payment about two weeks later.

Our first stock in the financials $12 billion KeyCorp ticker KEY and its 5.8% dividend yield.

KeyCorp is a small regional bank with branches in 16 states but concentrated mostly in Ohio and New York. And those of you in the Nation now financials are one of my favorite sectors for the next couple of years. The sector has been slammed by low rates and is trading at a deep discount.

Case in point shares of KeyCorp trade for just 0.81-times book value which is a 38% discount to the 1.3 multiple it traded at last year. So potentially a lot of value to be unlocked if interest rates start heading higher and the economy keeps growing.

Beyond valuation and the high dividend yield KeyCorp has lately made some strong acquisitions in technology names like HelloWallet and Laurel Road which could give it surprise growth above other regional banks.

The dividend payment has boomed 146% over the past five years and usually goes ex-dividend during the first days of the month in December March June and August.

Another value play here $3.5 billion oil play Devon Energy ticker DVN and its 5% yield.

Next to financials energy is my other big call for the next few years and in fact I’ve added Devon Energy into our 2021 Bow Tie Nation portfolio on Stockcard.

If you’re looking for one sector where everyone is fearful and it may be time to be greedy it’s in the energy space. The price of oil crashed this year on loss of demand and the entire sector has fallen 49% year-to-date.

Will Oil Stocks Recover in 2021?

Being ahead of this means finding those cash-rich best of breed oil companies with the survivability to recover when the market does and Devon is one of the best in the space. The company has nearly $1.5 billion in balance sheet cash and will have no problem keeping up with its debt.

Despite dropping into negative earnings last quarter the company still beat the market estimate by 30% and is expected to return to profitability by the first quarter.

Shares usually go ex-dividend mid-month in December March June and September and paid out a special dividend August this year. Even the lowest analyst estimate has shares up 42% over the next year for a potentially huge upside along with the dividend.

Omnicom ticker OMC is the world’s second-largest ad holding company spanning public relations traditional and digital advertising.

Ad spending is the first to go when company budgets get tight so it’s no surprise that Omnicom has sold off this year but it’s still a solid company. The company has over $3.3 billion in balance sheet cash so no near-term financial problems and is trading at a discount of 38% from its peak.

Management has a history of beating expectations and is positioned to take advantage of the growth in digital ads. The dividend payment has grown a respectable 30% over the past five years and shares go ex-dividend early- to mid-month.

Adding some diversification here with Archer-Daniels Midland ticker ADM and its 2.9% dividend.

Agricultural producers have just started rebounding this year after years of trade war pain and I think there’s further to go for processors like ADM. The company has one of the largest networks for crop storage and transportation which should do well as the trade picture improves.

Even under the weaker environment the dividend here grew by 28% over the last five years and I expect that to pick up. Shares go ex-dividend mid- to late-month in November February May and August.

Another energy name here with Schlumberger Limited ticker SLB and its 3.3% dividend yield.

Now this one is probably the riskiest of my energy bets but still a fairly solid company with $3.8 billion in balance sheet cash. As an oil-field services company Schlumberger has seen its revenue plunge this year as explorers pull back and let some of their fields go into maintenance.

The company is one of the best in its industry with an advantage in drilling that’s hard to beat so there’s a very good chance this one survives and produces not only that dividend but a hefty price return as well. The dividend was cut 75% in June to protect cash flow but still pays that 3.3% yield and goes ex-dividend usually towards the beginning of the month.

How to Pick Dividend Stocks for Daily Payments

We’ve got ten more dividend stocks to highlight and stick with me because we’ve got the highest yields coming up.

I want to go through real quickly how I picked these stocks how I put the portfolio together so you can find your own dividend stocks or just adjust the portfolio when you need to.

Now the concept is easy but it took hours to put together the data on this. I took the 366 stocks in the S&P 500 that pay dividends nearly 400 large-cap companies I then went to the stock page for each one. You can find this on any investing platform but I went to Yahoo Finance and then to this Historical Data tab.

From here I changed the time period and then to Show Dividends Only to see the dividend dates for the last five years. I took that and copied it into my spreadsheet for every single stock noting the dividend dates over the last year.

Once I did that I could note when each dividend stock paid out on each day and then could pick the best for our portfolio. For example for today’s video there were 178 stocks going ex-dividend mid-November and into December.

This allowed me not only to create an income portfolio that pays out nearly every weekday of the month but also to select only the strongest companies with the highest dividend yields.

More Dividend Stocks You Can Count On

Prologis ticker PLD is in one of my favorite real estate types right now and pays a 2.25% dividend.

My Bow Tie Warriors out there you know I love real estate. Got my professional start there as a commercial property analyst and have my own rentals but some of the property types are looking UGLY this year!

Eight of the 12 REIT property sectors are posting losses this year with some getting absolutely smashed. Retail down 39% lodging is down 49% and office space is down 30% for 2020. But there are some sectors doing relatively well like industrial self-storage and data centers are booming.

And Prologis is a leader in that industrial space with 900 million square feet of logistics and warehouse property. Strength in the segment is being driven by ecommerce and the need for those distribution centers and it’s a great long-term trend to be in.

The dividend payment has increased by 45% over the last five years and usually goes ex-dividend mid-month December March June and September.

CBOE Global Markets ticker CBOE operates the options exchange in Chicago and pays a 2% dividend yield.

CBOE is one of the smaller exchanges that have yet to be consolidated into the larger companies but still operates the largest U.S. options exchange as well as a futures exchange. With the growth in retail stock trading this year I’m surprised shares haven’t done better and I like this one as a rebound play.

The dividend has nearly doubled growing 83% over the last five years and it’s a great cash-flow stock going ex-dividend late-month in November February May and August.

Another investor favorite on the list here with the 3M Company ticker MMM and its 3.5% dividend yield.

3M is one of the oldest companies on the list around since 1902 and one that has increased its dividend for an amazing 62-consecutive years.

The company operates in four segments; industrial transportation and electronics healthcare and consumer which gives it a breadth you probably won’t find anywhere else and helps protect that cash flow.

As big as it is the dividend growth surprised me here with 43% growth in the payment in the last five years along with a stable price return. Shares go ex-dividend mid-month in November February May and August.

Another in the financial sector this one in insurance with Prudential Financial ticker PRU and its 6.7% dividend.

Prudential is the second-largest life insurer in the U.S. with significant exposure in Japan as well. The entire industry has been hit on those low interest rates making it harder for insurers to earn a return on their cash reserves but management has released a plan to cut $500 million in costs to boost the bottom line.

Shares trade for a 30% discount on a price-to-book value trading for just 0.4-times the book value of assets and this one has grown the dividend by a solid 57% over the last five years.

Hey Nation while I’ve got you here can I ask a favor? If you’re on Instagram head on over after this video and join the Let’s Talk Money community. I’m sharing motivational quotes investing advice and a personal side I don’t get to show here on the channel so I hope I see you there.

Six more dividend stocks to round out the list and next is Waste Management ticker WM and its 1.9% dividend yield.

Now a 2% yield might not sound so great but this stock has produced an annualized 12.2% return on top of that yield over the last decade. It’s the largest solid waste services company in the U.S. with over 250 land fills and let’s face it probably one of the most stable business models there is.

The share price isn’t the only thing growing with the dividend up 42% over the last five years and one where you can count on future growth.

I highlighted Huntington Bancshares ticker HBAN recently as a favorite in the financials and its 6.3% dividend yield.

Huntington is another small regional bank with branches across eight states in the Midwest. The bank has doubled the amount in its loan loss provision account to over $1.7 billion and has still been able to consistently beat earnings expectations. It’s trading at a 35% discount to last year’s price-to-book multiple and if loan defaults aren’t as bad as feared could see a major earnings surprise.

Even with the slowdown over the past year the dividend has grown 114% over the last five years for a great yield on top of that price potential.

A little more of a safety pick here with PPL Corporation ticker PPL and its 6% dividend.

PPL is a regulated utility provider in Pennsylvania and Kentucky that recently announced plans to sell off its UK operations. That will take a lot of the uncertainty out of the business model and allow the company to focus on its U.S. operations. The move gives it more dividend stability and should also improve investor sentiment in the shares.

And that dividend uncertainty has played out with just a 10% dividend growth over the past five years the lowest in our group but I think you see it start rising from here.

Another agriculture play here with FMC Corporation ticker FMC and its 1.6% dividend yield.

Now another one with a relatively low dividend but an amazing total return producing a 12.6% annual price return over the last decade on top of that yield.

FMC is a pure-play crop chemical company and should benefit from that long-term trend to food demand and the need for higher crop yields. Shares are fairly valued here but it’s hard to argue with a 166% growth in the dividend over five years and that kind of long-term price return.

A little riskier bet in the real estate space is Ventas ticker VTR a healthcare REIT and its 4.3% dividend.

Ventas owns a portfolio of 1200 properties across medical office hospital and healthcare but concentrated in the senior living and skilled nursing niche. Most healthcare properties have been hit this year but most especially the senior care market but it looks like even this is turning more positive.

Occupancy hasn’t declined significantly and with a vaccine approval we should get better investor sentiment in names like Ventas. Shares are down 41% from last year’s peak and the company did cut the dividend this year to protect cash flow but I think it can be a strong long-term investment.

Valero Energy ticker VLO offers our highest yield of the group with a dividend just under 10%.

One of the largest refinery operations in the U.S. with 14 facilities in North America and the U.K. the company is uniquely positioned to refine lower-quality crude and has been able to produce higher profit margins.

The refineries have been hit just like all energy companies but quality names like Valero will survive. The company also owns over 3100 miles of pipeline and other midstream assets that give it a transportation advantage.

Valero is one of the very few in the energy space to maintain its dividend this year and has nearly doubled it over the past five years.

November Dividends List

The 17 stocks in this months portfolio produce a dividend yield of 4.9% just slightly above the entire 56-stock portfolio with a 4.2% yield. That’s 56 dividend-paying companies in every sector with a yield more than double the overall market that is going to put cash in your pocket every single day!

Investing in Dividends is Safe and Steady

What is the one thing everybody wants?

Money.

Everybody wants some more money but not everyone is willing to work hard for it. What if you are someone who does not want to have to work for your money? Well you can just leave that up to the stock market! Stocks are a way of owning part of a company and owning something means having rights to some of what that business makes. When companies make money they have to decide what to do with it put it in the bank (savings) invest in new equipment (capital expenditures) or give it back to shareholders (dividends).

However most companies choose option number 3 giving dividends back! There are two types of dividends: cash dividends and stock dividends. Cash dividends are just that money! You will get a check in your mailbox or direct deposited into your account. The amount changes every quarter since it depends on how much the company made.

Dividends are one of the most important things when it comes to buying stocks. There are many different types of investors you can be but dividends should definitely make up a big part of your strategy. If you do not actually get money every time the company makes money then what good does it do? Well dividends are taxed less than regular income so if you want to keep more of your own money they allow for this! Not only this but it is very safe. When they give you that money it is real money in your bank account (or brokerage statement). If something bad happens to the stock market then there is no chance they will go bankrupt and stop paying out dividends.

There are many different types of dividends you can get: quarterly dividend special dividend variable dividend high yield dividend  etc. They have different rules for how often you get them or how much they are. A good company will usually payout a very high percentage of their earnings each year as cash dividends – usually 4-5%. You are probably thinking this sounds too good to be true and you would be right. There are a few things to keep in mind when investing in dividend paying stocks.

Dividends are one of the most important things when it comes to picking stocks they can make a huge difference over time! They allow companies to pay back investors for all their hard work while still having some left over for themselves. Plus they offer lower risk than normal investments because they do not fluctuate as much as the stock price does. However beware that dividends may decrease or stop completely if you invest in a company during a bad period. It is also very important for investors looking for these high yields to have a lot of research on their potential investments.

Procter & Gamble’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry over the past year (+9.9% vs. +8.3%). The company has been gaining from robust pricing and a favorable mix along with strength across segments.



Procter & Gamble has been focused on productivity and cost-saving plans to boost margins. This led to bottom line beating the consensus mark for the seventh consecutive quarter in third-quarter fiscal 2024. Consequently PG has provided an optimistic fiscal 2024 view.



However the company has been witnessing supply-chain issues higher SG&A costs higher transportation costs and rising inflation. Its significant international presence exposes it to foreign currency risks which acts as a headwind.

Shares Verizon of have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the past year (+12.8% vs. +11.7%). The company has reported modest first-quarter results with the bottom line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line missing the same. The deployment of a cloud-native container-based virtualized architecture has led to increased flexibility scalability and cost efficiency across its network.



Verizon is offering various mix and match pricing in both wireless and home broadband plans which has led to solid client additions. Focus on emerging growth services like cloud security and professional services will likely reap long-term benefits.



However lower wireline and wireless equipment revenues are major concerns. Huge promotional expenses and lucrative discounts to expand customer base are weighing on margins. High capital expenditure for continuous network upgrade and fiber deployment is a headwind. A muted guidance for 2024 is worrisome.



(You can read the full research report on Verizon here >>>)



Intuitive Surgical’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry over the past year (+25.7% vs. +4.0%). The company ended the first quarter on a positive note beating estimates on both counts. Revenues improved year over year. The strong performance is likely to continue in 2024 on the back of continued growth in the company’s da Vinci procedure volume coupled with strong Ion procedure growth.



ISRG’s initiative to increase the pricing of procedures should also continue to aid in sales growth in 2024.Improving procedure volume along with better system placements and services across all markets will drive top-line growth this year. Launch of da Vinci SP in Europe and da Vinci 5 in U.S. market should drive system placements higher.



However ongoing supply chain constraints although easing are likely to hurt the availability of devices. Labor shortage in hospitals will likely act as a headwind to procedure growth in 2024.

The P&G block is available as of Feb 1 2025 and podium signage is offered. The space is being marketed towards life sciences companies and data centre operators. It offers 25 watts of power per sq ft.

If you're in the Cleveland area you can check out the snow paradise inside the baseball stadium.

Cleveland Indians Progressive Field is a bit of a jarring site to take in when you first walk inside this winter. It looks somewhat like your crazy neighbor with the over-decorated Christmas house took over the stadium. The decorations are a tad overdone or perhaps it's that there's not quite enough. It is certainly no theme park but it is undeniably charming and soon you realize it could be the most fun Cleveland's had since LeBron was there.

""The last time we really had a significant non-baseball event here was the Jimmy Buffet concert back in 1994"" senior director of merchandising Kurt Schloss said. ""It's very memorable for people when they're down here for a baseball game but how do we drive them back down to Cleveland when baseball isn't around?""

Welcome to the Indians Snow Days.

A snow machine blows snowballs at anxious youngsters and a quarter-mile long 16-feet-wide ice skating track borders the field. Dubbed ""The Frozen Mile"" it was built by the same company who created the track for the Vancouver Olympics and is the first ice track in the US. Then there's the main attraction the Batterhorn where fans race in tubes down a 10-lane-wide ice luge that's been built into the stadium bleachers.

Sure there are a few dispensable attractions like a maze made from haystacks but the most memorable feature isn't an attraction at all: it's the Indian's home dugout. It's heated open to the public and for many fans this might be the first and only time they'll have the opportunity to sit where Grady Sizemore Carlos Santana and Travis Hafner sit at games.

The idea began back in 2009 and after focus groups meetings and scouting out other stadium's off-season events including the Winter Classic in Boston's Fenway Park the idea for Snow Days emerged. Aside from driving people back to the stadium and downtown area that is for the most part dead in the off-season the Indians hope the event will help boost ticket sales.

""We really think that the long-term affects of having an event like this will be more interest in the Indians organization as a whole"" Schloss explained. ""The goal is to have younger generations say gosh I remember going down to Indians Snow Days why don't we go down and see a baseball game?""

Snow Days runs until Jan. 2.

DELAWARE STORK (Egreta bidensis robinettus)

A close relative of the snowy Egret this statuesque bird is known for its longevity and survival instinct. Bearing long legs and pure white head feathers The Delaware Stork is regularly spotted along coastlines particularly the shore between the District of Columbia and Wilmington Delaware. Sometimes called the “Amtrak Bird” because it is often viewed by passengers on Amtrak’s Northeast corridor trains the Delaware Stork had a small presence in the D.C. area for many years. However its presence has grown over the decades and it now dominates the Capitol area. Its call is a repeated somewhat garbled three syllable whistle sounding like “Here’s the deal Here’s the deal.”

KENTUCKY COOT (Tortoisius mitchellis)

This somewhat haggard-appearing gray grouse is also known by its nickname the Louisville

Turtle based on its unique beak and profile. Slow moving and deliberate on the ground the Kentucky Coot has been and still is a constant presence in the D.C. area. Not a particularly gregarious bird except when interacting with irksome competitive birds like the Blue Speaker (Dux pelosis) the Kentucky Coot will spar while fiercely avoiding their bills. Hence another common nickname of this bird the Gray Killbill.

ORANGE-CAPPED MAGAPIE (Trumperius bombasticus)

This large orange-crested fowl also known as the Trumpeting Mockingbird was quite

prominent here in recent years often spotted along nearby golf fairways although this bulbous avian now prefers a south Florida habitat. Larger than a raven and more bombastic than a jay the Orange-Capped Magapie has a propensity to chatter and tweet incessantly though observers have noticed far less of this vocalizing since the beginning of the year. Where other magpies will often seek discarded shiny objects to line their nests the Orange-capped Magapie guards its own nest zealously in a misguided and futile attempt to stop the stealing. Ornithologists have observed behavior supporting the probability that the Orange-Capped Magapie has an urge to return to the Capitol.

BLUE HOUSE KINGLET (Dux pelosis)

A colorful member of the avian world the Blue House Kinglet is attracted to large inviting chambers and often is seen perched on top of a house appearing to preside over it. This sparrow is among the most liberal of all avians in its interactions with other species appearing to want to share resources with all. Though quite democratic in its socializing with other birds especially doves this bird can be fearless and firm if attacked. The Blue House Kinglet is a well-known antagonist to the Kentucky Coot.

YELLOW-BELLIED TERN (Lindsavis opportuniticus)

A native of South Carolina the Yellow-bellied Tern has the curious flight habit of making

constant u-turns and adjusting its migration pattern to whichever way the wind is blowing. A fickle bird it once attacked competitors like the Orange-Capped Magapie but now it is often seen sharing a branch or feeder with that bird. A notorious opportunist the Yellow-Bellied Tern forgoes building a nest of his own but instead seeks the nesting areas of the most powerful avians in his area hoping to become part of their brood . . . at least for the time being.

GEORGIA NUTHATCH (Greenius marjorius insanis)

A diminutive avian with limited intelligence this nuthatch also known as the Yellow-Capped

Booby is often seen seeking company with common redpolls and American redstarts yet has a curious habit of attacking other birds with blue features particularly bluebirds blue jays and even indigo buntings—seemingly any bird with a blue hue. Unlike eastern nuthatches with their prominent mask-like eye line the Georgia Nuthatch is unmasked and proudly so. One can identify the Georgia Nuthatch by its call a repeated whistle that sounds like “Conspiracy conspiracy!”

OHIO HARRIER (Malus jordanius)

This beefy raptor of the hawk family has close cropped head feathers and a proclivity for

perching only on the far right of limbs and branches. This raptor is easily identified by its incessant haranguing and attacking of other avians perched on the left sometimes even appearing to wrestle with them. Conservative in its socializing with other fowl the Ohio Harrier is curiously drawn to the company of the Orange-Capped Magapie and appears to try to protect it from attacks. His voice is a harsh guttural “Freedom!” repeated three times.

BURLINGTON SANDPIPER (Independentis bernium)

A common summer sight in the Capitol area and Vermont the Burlington Sandpiper is a

particularly social bird. Some might even say that it is socialist in its behavior at feeders spreading the seed evenly to all participants while attempting to gain a fair share from those birds dominating the top. Its voice is a repeated downward guttural undulation sounding like “Medicare for all.” This bird sometimes seems like an avian “Pied Piper” with its habit of attracting a devoted following of youthful sandpipers.

REDWING HAWK (Iritus hawliensis yalensis)

A handsome member of the hawk family this aggressive bird migrates not from north to south but horizontally from Washington to Missouri. A relentless attacker the Redwing Hawk has the curious habit of nesting with the Orange-Capped Magapie and attacks any fowl attempting to dispute that Magapie’s claim to its nest by raising its wings in a fiercely obstructionist manner.

TEXAS PRAIRIE CHICKEN (Luciferius cruzius)

One of the least liked birds of the Washington D.C. populace the Texas Prairie Chicken has the unique habit of dual migrations: the first to its Texas habitat and the second from that state to Cancún whenever a strong storm threatens to cause disruption. One of the most aggressive birds in the Capitol area the Texas Prairie Chicken has been known to squawk and harangue incessantly for

hours on end when gathered with other species in hopes of its competitors finally capitulating and moving on. Like the Yellow-Bellied Tern the Texas Prairie Chicken once harangued and berated the Orange-Capped Magapie but now is often spotted sharing a branch with that Magapie.

Gottheimer says progressive protesters shouted 'Jew' at NJ event,"Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo is backing up a Jewish congressman’s incendiary claim that he heard protesters scream “Jew!” at him during a September event in New Jersey.

Garden State Democratic Rep. Josh Gottheimer caused a stir during a Dec. 13 speech at Rutgers University in which he said he was set upon by anti-Semitic protesters on Sept. 20 as he and Raimondo made a series of stops in Bergen County promoting President Joe Biden’s infrastructure bill.

The pair were greeted by around 100 hecklers in Glen Rock — most of whom Gottheimer claimed came from the local chapter of the Working Families Party. The situation was intense enough that Raimondo’s security detail insisted the pair travel in the commerce secretary’s vehicle.

“They were going from store to store protesting and as we were going into the bakery someone from the crowd derisively screamed ‘Jew!'” Gottheimer said adding that Raimondo heard the remark too and reacted with disgust. “She couldn’t believe it. I remember looking at her.”

Raimondo told The Post this week she too heard the hateful jeers.

“Anti-Semitism is wrong reprehensible and unacceptable. I join Congressman Gottheimer in condemning these hateful attacks that have absolutely no place in our politics” Raimondo said.

Though a Democrat Gottheimer is among his party’s most moderate voices and his attacks on “The Squad” and progressives has long drawn activist ire. WFP endorsed his unsuccessful 2020 primary opponent Arati Kreibich — who was at the protest herself.

The WFP refuted Gottheimer’s claim.

“There is no place for antisemitism at WFP and to be clear if that ever happened at a WFP event the person would have been rebuked instantly and asked to leave” said Sue Altman the party’s New Jersey state director. “We have reviewed video footage from our protests and interviewed many many participants in them including Jewish WFP members. All the footage has been made available to the press. We found no sign of such an outburst. No one we spoke to witnessed any anti-Semitic speech and most volunteered that they’d have shut down such behavior immediately.”

The congressman had come to campus to voice his displeasure over a decision by the the part-time faculty union at Rutgers to support Hamas during their most recent round of hostilities against Israel.

“Not long ago I held an event in my district to talk about the benefits of the bipartisan federal infrastructure bill only to have members of the Working Families Party disrupt the event by screaming ‘Jew’ at me. What has our country come to?” Gottheimer told students.

InsiderNJ which covered the protest at the time noted that things had been “a bit impolite” and that “verbal insults were hurled at the congressman.”

The Rutgers speech nevertheless circulated in Jewish circles and won praise from Jonathan Greenblatt CEO of the Anti-Defamation League.

“Congressman Gottheimer spoke movingly about the threat of anti-Semitism facing students on campus and we applaud him for highlighting it. If the Congressman says he was the victim of an anti-Semitic remark we take him at his word” an ADL spokesman Jake Hyman said.",,,,,,

The company disclosed that a third party illegally accessed one of its file repositories including limited R&D data during the intrusion. Volvo’s investigation found that the incident could have effects on its operations.

Subsequently the Snatch cyber threat group added Volvo’s logo and screenshots of allegedly stolen data to its data leak site and leaked 35.9 MB as proof of responsibility.

Based in Gothenburg Sweden the Chinese Geely Holdings-owned manufacturer employs about 40000 people globally. Its sales were over $15 billion in the first half of 2021 and the company had this year’s largest IPO in Europe on October 29.

Volvo acknowledges a security breach that leaked R&D data

Volvo’s data breach notification said it acted “immediately and implemented security countermeasures including steps to prevent further access to its property and notified relevant authorities.”

The company also commenced an investigation into the security breach and involved a third-party cybersecurity specialist. Preliminary results of the probe confirmed that an unauthorized party illegally accessed the company’s R&D data.

Additionally the investigators suggested that the security breach could have potential impacts on the company’s operations.

“Investigations so far confirm that a limited amount of the company’s R&D property has been stolen during the intrusion” the company wrote. “Volvo Cars has earlier today concluded based on information available that there may be an impact on the company’s operation.”​​​​​​

Volvo did not explain the nature of the stolen R&D data or the scope of the security breach. Additionally the company refused to comment further on the incident.

Volvo’s response to additional information requests stated that the company does not comment on speculations about possible cybersecurity attacks but takes all threats and property thefts seriously.

Similarly the company claimed that cybersecurity was a priority and it “actively participates in the international work on standardization and best practices applying and contributing to the cybersecurity recommendations accepted by the industry.”

The company also assured the public that the security breach did not affect the “safety or security of its customers’ cars or their personal data.” It seems that the security breach was a possible corporate cyber-espionage incident targeting R&D data.

“The situation that Volvo finds itself in highlights a peripheral danger in leaked or stolen enterprise data-the threat of intellectual property and other proprietary information falling into the wrong hands” said Trevor Morgan product manager at Comforte AG.

Volvo hackers ‘Snatch’ deny being a ransomware group

The media outlet Inside-It reported that the cybercrime gang Snatch took responsibility for the security breach on November 30 2021.

Snatch ransomware variant compromises its victims by booting Windows PCs in Safe Mode. The strategy allows the malware to avoid detection by security protections that do not work in Safe Mode.

However the threat actors denied any association with the ransomware group according to Bleeping Computer. The group distanced itself from “projects created earlier under the same name” adding that they do not demand a ransom to decrypt data.

Additionally the group claimed to work exclusively with their potential customers’ data. Their statement supports the previous suggestion that the R&D data heist was a potential cyber-espionage incident.

KnowBe4’s security awareness advocate Erich Kron noted that the incident demonstrated how intellectual property was under threat.

“Although ransomware groups are often involved in the theft of personal information this is an example of how corporate information and intellectual property can also be a target” Kron said. “Most ransomware is spread through phishing emails or through exploiting RDP instances open to the internet.”

Kron also noted that Snatch threat actors exploit RDP tools for lateral movement across the network. He recommended strong passwords avoiding password reuse and monitoring RDP connections for brute force attacks.

“Automotive manufacturers go to great lengths to keep next model year vehicles from prying eyes and the same is true for data especially R&D data” Chris Clark Senior Manager at Synopsys Software Integrity Group concluded. “Protecting key assets like research data is especially critical in a high-intensity market like automotive.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vbXlzdG9ja21hcmtldGJhc2ljcy5jb20vZGl2aWRlbmQtc3RvY2tzLWRhaWx5LWNhc2gtZmxvdy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,17 Dividend Stocks for Daily Cash Flow,"Here are dividend stocks for daily cash flow that I recommend you have in your portfolio for long term growth.

How to Create a Dividend Portfolio for Daily Cash

We can do this because most dividend stocks pay out on extremely consistent schedules. Investors love the certainty and dividend-paying companies try paying out in the same week even the same day every three months. That means with a little bit of strategy we can fill our portfolio with income stocks that will time our payments for every day of the week.

Now how this is going to work is through these three videos I’ll highlight those dividend income stocks that will be paying out in the next month. For example today we’ll highlight 17 dividend stocks that will pay out in December March June and September. I’ll show you exactly how I found these stocks later in the video but here you can see that I analyzed almost 400 dividend stocks to find the perfect income portfolio for each and every month.

The goal here is going to be about 60 stocks that will generate a dividend income on every weekday of each month. And the best part not only is this going to be a well-diversified portfolio producing constant dividends I’ve picked the best dividend stocks with a yield over 4%…that’s twice the average dividend yield on the market.

Dividend Stocks for Constant Cash Flow

Let’s jump right into that list then I’ll show you how I put together the portfolio of daily dividend stocks!

We’re getting started with a fan favorite Iron Mountain ticker IRM and one of the best dividend yields on the list at nine percent.

IRM is a records management provider with more than 225000 clients trusting it to store hard copy documents as well as digital transformations and storage. But the real value here comes in the form of the company’s real estate where all this is stored more than 90 million square feet across almost 1500 properties.

The company is set up as a real estate investment trust which means it gets a special tax break if it distributes at least 90% of profits to investors. That means you get that sky-high 9% yield with the stock going ex-dividend about mid-month in December March June and September.

IRM is a great start to our dividend portfolio and has grown its payout by 27% over the last five years.

Now remember the dates you’re going to see here on these dividend stocks are the ex-dividend date. How it works is a company’s Board of Directors declares the next dividend and the ex-dividend date. That ex-dividend date is the first day the shares trade WITHOUT the dividend so if you want that payout you want to make sure you pick up the shares at least one day before this.

The idea here isn’t to jump in or out of these dividend stocks so this isn’t going to matter as much to you long-term investors. Just put the stock in your portfolio and you’ll get that dividend every time it comes around.

Next on the list of daily dividend stocks powerhouse Altria Group ticker MO and its 8.8% dividend.

Now if you’re set against investing in some of these vice stocks then you can always substitute out another dividend payer that goes ex-dividend around the same time but for yield and dividend certainty it’s hard to beat Altria.

Besides owning the dominant tobacco brand in the U.S. and a dividend that has grown by 53% over the last five years Altria has some key investments that will help it grow. The company holds a 10% stake in the world’s largest brewer Anheuser-Busch and a 45% stake in cannabis giant Cronos Group. So you’ve got very stable cash flow from the tobacco and alcohol segments and that moonshot potential in cannabis.

Altria is one of the later stocks to go ex-dividend on our list late in December March June and September. That means you’ll usually get your dividend payment about two weeks later.

Our first stock in the financials $12 billion KeyCorp ticker KEY and its 5.8% dividend yield.

KeyCorp is a small regional bank with branches in 16 states but concentrated mostly in Ohio and New York. And those of you in the Nation now financials are one of my favorite sectors for the next couple of years. The sector has been slammed by low rates and is trading at a deep discount.

Case in point shares of KeyCorp trade for just 0.81-times book value which is a 38% discount to the 1.3 multiple it traded at last year. So potentially a lot of value to be unlocked if interest rates start heading higher and the economy keeps growing.

Beyond valuation and the high dividend yield KeyCorp has lately made some strong acquisitions in technology names like HelloWallet and Laurel Road which could give it surprise growth above other regional banks.

The dividend payment has boomed 146% over the past five years and usually goes ex-dividend during the first days of the month in December March June and August.

Another value play here $3.5 billion oil play Devon Energy ticker DVN and its 5% yield.

Next to financials energy is my other big call for the next few years and in fact I’ve added Devon Energy into our 2021 Bow Tie Nation portfolio on Stockcard.

If you’re looking for one sector where everyone is fearful and it may be time to be greedy it’s in the energy space. The price of oil crashed this year on loss of demand and the entire sector has fallen 49% year-to-date.

Will Oil Stocks Recover in 2021?

Being ahead of this means finding those cash-rich best of breed oil companies with the survivability to recover when the market does and Devon is one of the best in the space. The company has nearly $1.5 billion in balance sheet cash and will have no problem keeping up with its debt.

Despite dropping into negative earnings last quarter the company still beat the market estimate by 30% and is expected to return to profitability by the first quarter.

Shares usually go ex-dividend mid-month in December March June and September and paid out a special dividend August this year. Even the lowest analyst estimate has shares up 42% over the next year for a potentially huge upside along with the dividend.

Omnicom ticker OMC is the world’s second-largest ad holding company spanning public relations traditional and digital advertising.

Ad spending is the first to go when company budgets get tight so it’s no surprise that Omnicom has sold off this year but it’s still a solid company. The company has over $3.3 billion in balance sheet cash so no near-term financial problems and is trading at a discount of 38% from its peak.

Management has a history of beating expectations and is positioned to take advantage of the growth in digital ads. The dividend payment has grown a respectable 30% over the past five years and shares go ex-dividend early- to mid-month.

Adding some diversification here with Archer-Daniels Midland ticker ADM and its 2.9% dividend.

Agricultural producers have just started rebounding this year after years of trade war pain and I think there’s further to go for processors like ADM. The company has one of the largest networks for crop storage and transportation which should do well as the trade picture improves.

Even under the weaker environment the dividend here grew by 28% over the last five years and I expect that to pick up. Shares go ex-dividend mid- to late-month in November February May and August.

Another energy name here with Schlumberger Limited ticker SLB and its 3.3% dividend yield.

Now this one is probably the riskiest of my energy bets but still a fairly solid company with $3.8 billion in balance sheet cash. As an oil-field services company Schlumberger has seen its revenue plunge this year as explorers pull back and let some of their fields go into maintenance.

The company is one of the best in its industry with an advantage in drilling that’s hard to beat so there’s a very good chance this one survives and produces not only that dividend but a hefty price return as well. The dividend was cut 75% in June to protect cash flow but still pays that 3.3% yield and goes ex-dividend usually towards the beginning of the month.

How to Pick Dividend Stocks for Daily Payments

We’ve got ten more dividend stocks to highlight and stick with me because we’ve got the highest yields coming up.

I want to go through real quickly how I picked these stocks how I put the portfolio together so you can find your own dividend stocks or just adjust the portfolio when you need to.

Now the concept is easy but it took hours to put together the data on this. I took the 366 stocks in the S&P 500 that pay dividends nearly 400 large-cap companies I then went to the stock page for each one. You can find this on any investing platform but I went to Yahoo Finance and then to this Historical Data tab.

From here I changed the time period and then to Show Dividends Only to see the dividend dates for the last five years. I took that and copied it into my spreadsheet for every single stock noting the dividend dates over the last year.

Once I did that I could note when each dividend stock paid out on each day and then could pick the best for our portfolio. For example for today’s video there were 178 stocks going ex-dividend mid-November and into December.

This allowed me not only to create an income portfolio that pays out nearly every weekday of the month but also to select only the strongest companies with the highest dividend yields.

More Dividend Stocks You Can Count On

Prologis ticker PLD is in one of my favorite real estate types right now and pays a 2.25% dividend.

My Bow Tie Warriors out there you know I love real estate. Got my professional start there as a commercial property analyst and have my own rentals but some of the property types are looking UGLY this year!

Eight of the 12 REIT property sectors are posting losses this year with some getting absolutely smashed. Retail down 39% lodging is down 49% and office space is down 30% for 2020. But there are some sectors doing relatively well like industrial self-storage and data centers are booming.

And Prologis is a leader in that industrial space with 900 million square feet of logistics and warehouse property. Strength in the segment is being driven by ecommerce and the need for those distribution centers and it’s a great long-term trend to be in.

The dividend payment has increased by 45% over the last five years and usually goes ex-dividend mid-month December March June and September.

CBOE Global Markets ticker CBOE operates the options exchange in Chicago and pays a 2% dividend yield.

CBOE is one of the smaller exchanges that have yet to be consolidated into the larger companies but still operates the largest U.S. options exchange as well as a futures exchange. With the growth in retail stock trading this year I’m surprised shares haven’t done better and I like this one as a rebound play.

The dividend has nearly doubled growing 83% over the last five years and it’s a great cash-flow stock going ex-dividend late-month in November February May and August.

Another investor favorite on the list here with the 3M Company ticker MMM and its 3.5% dividend yield.

3M is one of the oldest companies on the list around since 1902 and one that has increased its dividend for an amazing 62-consecutive years.

The company operates in four segments; industrial transportation and electronics healthcare and consumer which gives it a breadth you probably won’t find anywhere else and helps protect that cash flow.

As big as it is the dividend growth surprised me here with 43% growth in the payment in the last five years along with a stable price return. Shares go ex-dividend mid-month in November February May and August.

Another in the financial sector this one in insurance with Prudential Financial ticker PRU and its 6.7% dividend.

Prudential is the second-largest life insurer in the U.S. with significant exposure in Japan as well. The entire industry has been hit on those low interest rates making it harder for insurers to earn a return on their cash reserves but management has released a plan to cut $500 million in costs to boost the bottom line.

Shares trade for a 30% discount on a price-to-book value trading for just 0.4-times the book value of assets and this one has grown the dividend by a solid 57% over the last five years.

Hey Nation while I’ve got you here can I ask a favor? If you’re on Instagram head on over after this video and join the Let’s Talk Money community. I’m sharing motivational quotes investing advice and a personal side I don’t get to show here on the channel so I hope I see you there.

Six more dividend stocks to round out the list and next is Waste Management ticker WM and its 1.9% dividend yield.

Now a 2% yield might not sound so great but this stock has produced an annualized 12.2% return on top of that yield over the last decade. It’s the largest solid waste services company in the U.S. with over 250 land fills and let’s face it probably one of the most stable business models there is.

The share price isn’t the only thing growing with the dividend up 42% over the last five years and one where you can count on future growth.

I highlighted Huntington Bancshares ticker HBAN recently as a favorite in the financials and its 6.3% dividend yield.

Huntington is another small regional bank with branches across eight states in the Midwest. The bank has doubled the amount in its loan loss provision account to over $1.7 billion and has still been able to consistently beat earnings expectations. It’s trading at a 35% discount to last year’s price-to-book multiple and if loan defaults aren’t as bad as feared could see a major earnings surprise.

Even with the slowdown over the past year the dividend has grown 114% over the last five years for a great yield on top of that price potential.

A little more of a safety pick here with PPL Corporation ticker PPL and its 6% dividend.

PPL is a regulated utility provider in Pennsylvania and Kentucky that recently announced plans to sell off its UK operations. That will take a lot of the uncertainty out of the business model and allow the company to focus on its U.S. operations. The move gives it more dividend stability and should also improve investor sentiment in the shares.

And that dividend uncertainty has played out with just a 10% dividend growth over the past five years the lowest in our group but I think you see it start rising from here.

Another agriculture play here with FMC Corporation ticker FMC and its 1.6% dividend yield.

Now another one with a relatively low dividend but an amazing total return producing a 12.6% annual price return over the last decade on top of that yield.

FMC is a pure-play crop chemical company and should benefit from that long-term trend to food demand and the need for higher crop yields. Shares are fairly valued here but it’s hard to argue with a 166% growth in the dividend over five years and that kind of long-term price return.

A little riskier bet in the real estate space is Ventas ticker VTR a healthcare REIT and its 4.3% dividend.

Ventas owns a portfolio of 1200 properties across medical office hospital and healthcare but concentrated in the senior living and skilled nursing niche. Most healthcare properties have been hit this year but most especially the senior care market but it looks like even this is turning more positive.

Occupancy hasn’t declined significantly and with a vaccine approval we should get better investor sentiment in names like Ventas. Shares are down 41% from last year’s peak and the company did cut the dividend this year to protect cash flow but I think it can be a strong long-term investment.

Valero Energy ticker VLO offers our highest yield of the group with a dividend just under 10%.

One of the largest refinery operations in the U.S. with 14 facilities in North America and the U.K. the company is uniquely positioned to refine lower-quality crude and has been able to produce higher profit margins.

The refineries have been hit just like all energy companies but quality names like Valero will survive. The company also owns over 3100 miles of pipeline and other midstream assets that give it a transportation advantage.

Valero is one of the very few in the energy space to maintain its dividend this year and has nearly doubled it over the past five years.

November Dividends List

The 17 stocks in this months portfolio produce a dividend yield of 4.9% just slightly above the entire 56-stock portfolio with a 4.2% yield. That’s 56 dividend-paying companies in every sector with a yield more than double the overall market that is going to put cash in your pocket every single day!

Investing in Dividends is Safe and Steady

What is the one thing everybody wants?

Money.

Everybody wants some more money but not everyone is willing to work hard for it. What if you are someone who does not want to have to work for your money? Well you can just leave that up to the stock market! Stocks are a way of owning part of a company and owning something means having rights to some of what that business makes. When companies make money they have to decide what to do with it put it in the bank (savings) invest in new equipment (capital expenditures) or give it back to shareholders (dividends).

However most companies choose option number 3 giving dividends back! There are two types of dividends: cash dividends and stock dividends. Cash dividends are just that money! You will get a check in your mailbox or direct deposited into your account. The amount changes every quarter since it depends on how much the company made.

Dividends are one of the most important things when it comes to buying stocks. There are many different types of investors you can be but dividends should definitely make up a big part of your strategy. If you do not actually get money every time the company makes money then what good does it do? Well dividends are taxed less than regular income so if you want to keep more of your own money they allow for this! Not only this but it is very safe. When they give you that money it is real money in your bank account (or brokerage statement). If something bad happens to the stock market then there is no chance they will go bankrupt and stop paying out dividends.

There are many different types of dividends you can get: quarterly dividend special dividend variable dividend high yield dividend  etc. They have different rules for how often you get them or how much they are. A good company will usually payout a very high percentage of their earnings each year as cash dividends – usually 4-5%. You are probably thinking this sounds too good to be true and you would be right. There are a few things to keep in mind when investing in dividend paying stocks.

Dividends are one of the most important things when it comes to picking stocks they can make a huge difference over time! They allow companies to pay back investors for all their hard work while still having some left over for themselves. Plus they offer lower risk than normal investments because they do not fluctuate as much as the stock price does. However beware that dividends may decrease or stop completely if you invest in a company during a bad period. It is also very important for investors looking for these high yields to have a lot of research on their potential investments.

MANILA – The Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) is providing relief efforts in areas hit by Typhoon Odette and will conduct construction-related skills training.

Regional and provincial offices have started “TESDAmayan” activities in the communities affected by last week’s Typhoon Odette in Visayas and Mindanao according to its news release on Friday.

“TESDAmayan” is the agency’s banner program that aims to aid communities affected by any crisis brought about by natural calamities disasters or any other untoward incidents which causes displacement.

In Region 6 (Western Visayas) field office workers were deployed to help rebuild damaged buildings and conduct clearing operations.

Likewise Provincial Training Center (PTC) – Kabankalan in Negros Occidental installed solar-powered charging station for residents who need to recharge their mobile phones.

In Region 8 (Eastern Visayas) food packs clean water and used clothing were distributed while other interventions from TESDA provincial offices are being prepared

PTC - Agusan Del Norte in Caraga (Region 13) provided food bottled water and masks to 225 individuals in Barangay Humilog Remedios T. Romualdez on December 18.

In a memorandum TESDA Secretary Isidro Lapeña reiterated his previous directive to all regional and provincial offices to prepare training programs in areas affected by disasters and natural calamities.

Field offices according to Lapeña shall provide community-based training and training on construction-related qualifications to make the affected residents capable of rebuilding their houses.

“I have directed our Regional and Provincial Offices to expedite the provision of training on construction-related courses such as Carpentry and Electrical Installation so the displaced residents can immediately rebuild their homes. They will also get an allowance of PHP160 per day” he said.

“Since it will also take some time before electric power is restored in these areas there will also be training on solar panel installation the Photovoltaic Systems Installation so that solar power can be generated” Lapeña added.

President Rodrigo Duterte has declared a state of calamity in areas battered by Typhoon Odette particularly Mimaropa (Region 4-B) Western Visayas Central Visayas (Region 7) Eastern Visayas Northern Mindanao (Region 10) and Caraga.

“Despite the pandemic TESDA is here to provide relevant training programs as part of the collective action to support the rehabilitation of these disaster-stricken areas and ensure the well-being of all affected Filipinos” Lapeña said. (PR)",,,,,,,,,

Well-ordered and expansive its parking lot already neatly paved and marked the construction site is well on its way to completion — but there is yet to be a confirmation of proposed stores and scheduled grand opening. The neighborhood buzz however is thick.

“It’s nice to see an injection of retail in Rosebank” noted Linda Baran president and CEO of the Staten Island Chamber of Commerce referencing the North Shore revitalization that has been ongoing just a few towns over. “There’s buildings and housing going up just a stone’s throw away in the Bay Street Corridor which should bring an influx of new residents. A plaza of stores on Tompkins Avenue will bring increased options for those residents and that’s a good thing.”

Dubbed Tompkins Plaza and encompassing the addresses of 429 – 439 Tompkins Ave. the multiple-building project site is located directly across the street from the Garibaldi Meucci Museum and involves a decent sized parcel of land. The city Department of Buildings (DOB) noted that some permits for the site are incomplete and currently “disapproved” but there are active permits for at least three separate retail stores.

And while the DOB does not require developers to provide information in their permit applications about the specific commercial tenant that will occupy a building a recent spate of real estate ads aimed at potential tenants suggests a Dollar Tree and Lidl grocery store will occupy the space. The German international discount retailer chain that operates over 11000 stores across Europe and the United States one of which is located in New Springville would not confirm however noting it was “too early to share specific details on this particular site.”

“We do look forward to continuing our expansion in New York and serving more communities in the future” noted Chandler Ebeier Lidl’s public relations rep.

Structure Development Company a real estate developer based in Florida lists 435 Tompkins Ave. as part of its portfolio on its website noting that a four-story CubeSmart containing 856 self-storage units will occupy space there. And the national self-storage company which already has four locations on Staten Island is depicted in site renderings. CubeSmart however did not immediately respond to requests about confirmation of the new location.

The area is not devoid of shops and self-storage: Family Dollar Stop and Stor and American Self Storage all currently maintain active locations on the 300 block of Tompkins Avenue. There is also a Phil-Am Food Mart and Market Fresh Supermarket on a nearby stretch of the thoroughfare and Top Tomato and CVS are located about a block away on neighboring Bay Street.

“The area is not desolate by any means but I do think it could use a supermarket” Baran said. “When the Chamber did a needs assessment of St. George Tompkinsville and Stapleton that is something that came up.

The astonishing chart created using the GFXBench 3.1 benchmark also reveals surprising positions for the GPU parts of the Snapdragon 865 Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 and Snapdragon 888.

4 Reviews

A mobile SoC GPU efficiency chart has thrown up some arguably shocking results. The table which features 10 high-end SoCs is headed by the ARM Mali-G710 MP10 part that apparently featured in an alleged MediaTek Dimensity 9000-powered prototype device. Apple SoCs in the form of the A15 and A14 snatch up third and fourth place while the GPUs found in Google’s Tensor chip Samsung’s Exynos 2100 and Huawei’s Kirin 9000 take up seventh eighth and ninth position respectively. Snapdragon chips with Adreno GPUs are scattered throughout the chart offering up a mixture of good news and bad news.

The MediaTek Dimensity 9000 has already impressed thanks to its powerful CPU component but the ARM Mali-G710 MP10 has also proved itself worthy in this particular comparison. While it does not offer the highest FPS rate out of the group which is managed by the Apple A15 with 180 FPS because the Dimensity 9000 only uses 6.8 W (average power) in the test its decent frame rate of 160 FPS results in a terrific performance ratio of 23.5 FPS/Watt. This is +3.07% ahead of the Apple A15’s result of 22.8 FPS/Watt and is surely further demonstration of how capable the MediaTek SoC seems to be.

There are contrasting fortunes for Snapdragon SoCs in the chart which was posted by Golden Reviewer. While the now aging Snapdragon 865’s Adreno 650 only produces 89 FPS in the GFXBench 3.1 run it does so at an average cost of just 3.8 W leaving a very high efficiency ratio of 23.4 FPS/Watt – practically nipping on the heels of the MediaTek 9000/ARM Mali-G710 MP10 combination. However the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 SoC with Adreno 730 is less impressive with a ratio of 20.6 FPS/Watt and is nestled in at fifth place. A high frame rate of 175 FPS comes at the cost of 8.5 W power for the new chip from Qualcomm.

The Snapdragon 870 makes an appearance in sixth place with it also sporting an Adreno 650 GPU part. However it is the placing of the Snapdragon 888 that adds to the overall astonishment factor of this particular chart. The SoC's Adreno 660 GPU churns out 117 FPS but requires 8.2 W average power resulting in a 14.3 FPS/Watt efficiency ratio and last position in the chart. This leaves the MediaTek Dimensity 9000 GPU’s score of 23.5 a whopping +64.34% ahead of the Snapdragon 888 and the ARM Mali-G710 MP10 is also a healthy +14.08% more efficient here than the Adreno 730 in the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1.

It makes too much sense right?

The former Jaguars quarterback and first-round pick won a Super Bowl with the Bucs presides over one of the NFL’s highest-scoring offenses and has worked with Tom Brady for two seasons.

Well we’re about to see how creative Leftwich is as a play-caller as the Bucs enter Sunday’s game against the Panthers without three of their most productive weapons: receivers Chris Godwin (torn ACL) and Mike Evans (hamstring) and running back Leonard Fournette (hamstring).

The Bucs will have to put the puzzle back together using different pieces which will test Leftwich’s ability to put points on the board following last week’s shutout loss to the Saints.

“The first thing is you’ve got to get over who you’re missing right?” Leftwich said. “You’re thinking ‘Dang we’re going to have to do it without Mike without Chris and B.P. (receiver Breshad Perriman) is down. But you know it happened all in like 48 hours. It happened so quickly.

“But that’s the job. The job is not just to be able to put guys in position if it’s Mike Evans or Chris Godwin. Our job is to put whoever is there in position to have success and that’s really how I see it. Obviously you would love to have the guys who are out in the huddle. But that’s just football.”

Unlike 2020 the Bucs haven’t made use of their entire offensive roster this season. That may account for why aside from running back Ronald Jones the backups who entered the New Orleans game looked so woefully out of sync with Brady.

The easiest thing for Brady to do moving forward is turn and hand off the ball to Jones who was 22 yards shy of reaching 1000 in 2020.

Which other players will Leftwich and Brady need to lean on in the last three regular season games if not longer?

Antonio Brown — The Bucs are fortunate he returns from a three-game suspension this week but he hasn’t played since Oct. 15. Tampa Bay is 5-0 with Brown in the lineup but that’s been as a third receiver. What can he do with safeties rotating toward him as the No. 1 target? Also how much rust does he have to knock off?

“It helps any time you have him out there really on the grass” Leftwich said. “Obviously he’s just coming back too though.”

Rob Gronkowski — The tight end is coming off his worst game in years. He caught only two of 11 targets and dropped at least three others. Even Brady was at a loss to explain it. “I don’t know” he said. “Just didn’t play our best game obviously. Just a bad day.””

Cameron Brate — The Bucs could deploy more two-tight-end sets and let Brate work the middle of the field. He doesn’t get much separation and dropped a few passes he normally would catch Sunday. Brate has not caught more than four passes in any game this season and did that only once against the Rams.

Tyler Johnson — He’ll likely be thrust into Godwin’s role as the slot receiver. But he was pushed around by the Saints. Johnson’s lack of speed was glaring as he failed to get separation. He has only 27 receptions for 288 yards and no TDs on 42 targets an underwhelming 64.3 catch percentage.

Scotty Miller — Once the Bucs’ deep threat he’s now a clear-out guy on the outside to draw safety help. Halfway through 2020 Miller was the Bucs’ receiving yardage leader. He enters Sunday with only four catches for 29 yards and 0 TDs. Aside from some tunnel screens not sure he will have an impact.

Perriman the hero of the win over the Bills with his 58-yard TD catch in overtime is on the reserve/COVID-19 list. Le’Veon Bell signed this week and may not be ready to contribute as a third-down back.

“You’ve got to find different ways to win with different players different avenues for success” Brady said. “It’s not always the same thing that’s going to win all the time. I always feel like there’s got to be some type of opportunity guys look for in moments like this. Because you’re challenged in different ways it makes you think differently. Some of those things can add to other aspects of what we’re trying to do offensively.”

Kicking themselves

It was notable that Cowboys punter Bryan Anger and Rams kicker Matt Gay were named to the NFC Pro Bowl team.

Both of course are former Bucs. Anger who punted for Tampa Bay from 2016-18 leads the NFL with a 43.9 net average with 21 punts inside the 20.

Gay who was drafted by the Bucs in the fifth round in 2019 stayed only one season and made 77.1 percent of his field goal attempts before he was released. This year he’s 28 of 29 field goal attempts leading the NFL with 96.6 percent accuracy. Dating back to last season he’s made 42 of 45 field goal tries in the regular season and was a perfect 4 for 4 on field goals in the playoffs or 93.9 percent in 23 total games with the Rams.

Meanwhile Bucs punter Bradley Pinion is struggling with a hip injury. He’s 34th in yards per punt this season at 42.4. He also has the ninth-highest cap hit among all punters at $2.8 million.

“It’s just his play” Arians said of Pinion. “I don’t think the injury had anything to do with it.”

Kicker Ryan Succop missed his only try Sunday from 48 yards. His 81 percent made field goal percentage ranks 26th in the NFL. While he’s missed only four field goals Succop’s limited range has seen him attempt just 21. He’s also missed three extra points.

“It can’t continue that’s for sure” Arians said.

Practice squad punter Sterling Hofrichter and kicker Jose Borregales got plenty of reps in practice this week.

Playoff picture

The Bucs can clinch the NFC South with a win or tie against the Panthers or a loss or tie by the Saints.

They can clinch at least a wild-card berth with one of the following outcomes:

• Vikings loss or tie and Eagles loss or tie

• Vikings loss or tie and Cowboys win or tie

• Vikings loss or tie and Cowboys clinch at least a tie in strength-of-victory tiebreaker over the Eagles

• • •

Florida wide receiver Jacob Copeland a former four-star prospect announced Friday on Twitter that he will transfer to Maryland.

Copeland a redshirt junior started 11 games for the Gators this season recording 41 catches for a team-high 642 yards and four touchdowns. After entering the transfer portal he still suited up for the Gasparilla Bowl against Central Florida on Thursday night finishing with two catches for 35 yards in a 29-17 loss at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa.

The 6-foot 202-pound Copeland who was ranked the No. 69 player and No. 12 receiver in the Class of 2018 totaled 84 catches for 1331 yards and nine touchdowns in his career at Florida.

Copeland’s addition bolster’s a Maryland receiving corps that could be one of the best in the country next season. Senior Dontay Demus Jr. who was the Terps’ leading wide receiver before suffering a season-ending knee injury in October will return for a fifth season rather than enter the 2022 NFL draft. Junior receiver Jeshaun Jones who also suffered a season-ending injury is expected to return alongside sophomore Rakim Jarrett freshman Marcus Fleming and recently signed four-star recruits Octavian Smith Jr. and Shaleak Knotts.

""Enough of this voting nonsense. Jordan and Micah (Hyde) are the best. Simple facts. Can’t argue with stats. FIVE picks. Top graded coverage. Give me a damn break.

The Pro Bowl voting is made up of coaches players and fans. The AFC starters at the safety position include Kevin Byard of the Tennessee Titans Derwin James of the Los Angeles Chargers and Tyrann Mathieu of the Kansas City Chiefs.

Poyer has more interceptions than James and Mathieu and is tied with Byard with five. Byard has a touchdown to his credit though. Poyer has never made the Pro Bowl for as long as he’s been in the NFL which is about nine years.

""#1 defense in the NFL and not a single defensive player from the Bills in the dang Pro Bowl. How is that a pro bowl then?"" Bush added.

All hope is not lost though. It’s more than likely players will pull out over injuries or because of the playoffs. Poyer is a third alternate so he could still make the game.

Introduction & Test Setup 2. The Benchmarks Part 1 3. The Benchmarks Part 2 4. The DLSS Difference 5. Performance Summary & Head-to-Head 6. Closing Thoughts 7. View All Pages

Today we are taking a step back in time to revisit the mid-2019 battle between AMD's RX 5700 and RX 5700 XT and Nvidia's RTX 2060 Super and RTX 2070 Super. When AMD released its RX 5700-series GPUs they debuted with the company's first new graphics architecture in years. The RTX Super series however was a mere refresh of the Turing line-up that had launched only months prior. We put all four GPUs head-to-head today to see which cards have aged the best almost two and a half years on.

I was first inspired to do this testing after seeing a Reddit post asking which of the RX 5700 XT or RTX 2070 Super had aged the best. ‘That's a good question' I thought to myself and began testing both GPUs across more than 25 modern games to find out the answer.

About halfway through this testing I came to the realisation that comparing just those two cards wouldn't be telling the whole story. After all the RTX 2070 Super launched at £475 compared to the £379 MSRP of the RX 5700 XT and even though we saw very competitive performance from Team Red back in our launch day review the RX 5700 XT was never really positioned to go head-to-head with the RTX 2070 Super.

It still made sense to keep the RTX 2070 Super as part of the testing but we also decided to include the RTX 2060 Super itself arriving with a £379 MSRP as well. And at that point we figured we may as well go all in and add the RX 5700 to the comparison as well. All four GPUs were launched within days of each other in July 2019 so it's only right that we brought them all back for this testing today.

So to find out exactly how all four of these GPUs perform today across a total of 27 games over 20 game engines and three different APIs – please read on! I do also want to make it clear that we are testing both 1080p and 1440p resolutions but not 4K. While some games will be playable at 4K with these graphics cards the majority won't and these cards were never intended to be 4K gaming GPUs to begin with. Adding in 4K resolution testing then would have taken significantly more time while only being of limited practical use.

Driver Notes

AMD GPUs were benchmarked with the 21.12.1 driver.

Nvidia GPUs were benchmarked with the 497.09 driver.

MSI has teamed up with Ubisoft to launch a new gaming laptop called Crosshair 15/17. The 15-inch version will also be available with a custom color scheme borrowed from the upcoming Rainbow Six Extraction game set to launch in January.

The laptop will be based on Intel 12th Gen Core CPU and NVIDIA’s latest RTX 30 Ti GPU. The specifications do not list the top Core i9 SKU being used by this laptop but one would assume its Core i9-12900H(K) however variants with Core i7-12700H/12800H CPUs are also to be expected.

Crosshair 15 will be offered with up to GeForce RTX 3070 Ti which is the latest addition to the NVIDIA high-end segment. Unfortunately the spec sheet does not mention CUDA core count or TGP but at least it is confirmed to be an 8GB GDDR6 part.

Rainbow Six Extraction Edition – Crosshair 15 The Crosshair GL series is a collaboration between MSI and Ubisoft. The series features a futuristic design with exclusive sci-fi elements inspired by the feeling and mood of gameplay and the comes equipped with Intel® Core i9 processors and Cooler Boost 5 Technology.

These laptops offer a significant upgrade over their GTX 1080 touting counterparts. While the sheer graphical fidelity might not represent quite as big a step-change as last time what really sets the chip apart is the inclusion of dedicated cores for ray tracing (and other machine learning/AI tasks).

Ray tracing is the real-time lighting calculation that has helped CG movies look so amazing for years. While this isn’t enabled on all modern games (and a GTX 1080 can technically manage the feature in most cases) the effect is only getting better and is likely to become increasingly common and demanding. This makes a laptop with RTX 2080 a solid purchase decision right now.

Here’s our list of the best laptops with the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080.

Buying the best laptop with NVIDIA RTX 2080 GPU The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 was the top-of-the-line GPU from the RTX 20 series. When it comes to laptops however you shouldn’t expect the exact same levels of performance. You will get slightly lower performance with the difference varying according to the variant you pick.

You’ll see two variants of the RTX 2080. First NVIDIA provides a dedicated version for mobile that’s less powerful than the desktop version. The other variant is the RTX 2080 with Max-Q a tweaked version targeting maximum performance at a reduced power draw. It’s built for thin and light gaming laptops whereas the vanilla RTX 2080 will reside in models nearly an inch thick or larger.

If your priority is having a really portable machine with an RTX 2080 inside you’ll be better off with the RTX 2080 Max-Q. You’ll get lower performance though. On the other hand if portability isn’t a huge factor a laptop with the normal mobile RTX 2080 would be the way to go.

Your portability requirements will be the key while picking the best NVIDIA RTX 2080 laptop for you.

The other factors to consider have to do with picking a good gaming laptop overall. You’ll need a great screen preferably with a high refresh rate. A solid CPU to go along with the RTX 2080 is important too. Gaming laptops require pretty much every specification to be on the higher end. As such you’d do well to pick an option with more RAM and storage as well. See also: Best laptop deals available right now!

If you’re still not sure which NVIDIA RTX 2080 laptop is for you we’ve rounded up the best of the best to help make your laptop buying decision much easier.

RTX 20 laptops v/s RTX 30 laptops

Nvidia’s RTX 30 series laptops are already here so as such it’s valid to consider them while making your purchase decisions. The RTX 30 mobile lineup is fairly recent so equipped laptop options are becoming available right now.

With regards to performance you’re going to get more from RTX 30 with other hardware updated to meet the GPU as well. However the advantage with the RTX 20 laptops is that you can get them at reduced price tags as opposed to their original MRP. While the prices of some SKUs are still inflated if you pick well you can get better value for money with RTX 20 laptops than with RTX 30 laptops.

If you want the latest stuff however you’d do well to get an RTX 30 laptop over the RTX 20 ones. The updated hardware will hold up well and the availability to pricing ratio is likely to be better at this point in time.

The bottom line is that you should only be getting an RTX 20 series laptop right now if you’re getting some serious bang for your buck with other specifications like the CPU matching your requirements.

Other frequently asked questions Q: How much does a laptop with NVIDIA RTX 2080 cost?

A: NVIDIA RTX 2080 was the flagship GPU in the series and as such it comes at a premium. Laptops with this GPU start around the $2000 mark and can go all the way up to $4000. The sweet spot for these laptops lies between $2000 and $2500.

Q: What’s the difference between NVIDIA RTX 2080 Max-Q and Max-P?

A: As explained earlier Max-Q is a lower-powered version of the GPU made for slimmer and lighter laptops. Max-P is not an official NVIDIA brand but rather a terminology used by laptop manufacturers to denote “maximum performance” i.e. full power mobile GPU.

Q: Should you get an NVIDIA RTX 2080 laptop over a desktop?

A: You’ll get more performance from a desktop with RTX 2080 but a laptop offers an obvious advantage — portability. Desktop GPUs are also hard to find now at reasonable prices so a laptop would make more sense at the moment.

It is based on the GA104-770-A1 Ampere chip and offers 8 GB GDDR6 graphics memory with a 256 Bit memory bus. It supports PCIe 4.0 and will be available in two different variants from 80 to 125 Watt (TGP). As package the notebook graphic card uses GB5-256 and the chip size is 40x40mm. The GPU supports eDP 1.4b to connect the internal monitor.

There is no more Max-Q variant (formerly used for the low power variants) but every OEM can choose to implement Max-Q technologies (Dynamic Boost Whispermode).

The performance depends on the TGP setting and cooling of the laptop. On average it should be similar to the old RTX 2080 Super Mobile and therefore best suited for QHD - 4k gaming. The similar named RTX 3070 desktop card is significantly faster.

The GA104 chip offers 6144 FP32 ALUs of which half can also execute INT32 instructions (i.e. 3072 INT32 ALUs). The RTX 3070 however wont use all ALUs on the chip. With Turing all shaders could still execute FP32 or INT32 instructions. The raytracing and tensor cores on the chip were also improved according to Nvidia. The RTX 3070 mobile series uses 5120 of the 6144 cores. The Ampere chips also include an improved 5th generation video encoder (NVENC for H.264 and H.265) and a 7th generation decoder (for various formats now including AV1).

The GA104 chip is manufactured by Samsung in 8nm (8N) which is not quite able to keep up with the 7nm node at TSMC (e.g. used by AMD and also for the professional GA100 Ampere chip)."

What You Need To Know The U.S. government says it has halted distributing two of the three available COVID-19 monoclonal antibody treatments because they are not sufficiently effective against the omicron variant



The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response or ASPR announced the pause in a statement Wednesday



The Food and Drug Administration released data showing that it is unlikely the therapeutics from Regeneron and Eli Lilly retain activity against omicron



However a similar treatment developed by GlaxoSmithKline and Vir Biotechnology  called sotrovimab does appear to retain activity against the variant the FDA said

The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response or ASPR announced the pause in a statement Wednesday.

The Food and Drug Administration released data showing that it is unlikely the therapeutics from Regeneron and Eli Lilly retain activity against omicron. However a similar treatment developed by GlaxoSmithKline and Vir Biotechnology called sotrovimab does appear to retain activity against the variant the FDA said.

According to the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention omicron accounts for 73% of new cases in the U.S.

The ASPR said the pause is pending updated data from the CDC.

“Shipments of sotrovimab did resume this week and delivery of 55000 doses of product has begun” the ASPR statement said. “An additional 300000 doses of sotrovimab will be available for distribution in January.”

Monoclonal antibodies are lab-produced molecules that act as a substitute for antibodies that can restore enhance or mimic the immune system’s attack on cells. Regeneron’s antibody cocktail made headlines when it was administered to former President Donald Trump after he was infected by COVID-19 last year.

The treatments are given via subcutaneous injection typically to at-risk or immunocompromised patients who tested positive in order to prevent severe illness.

Regeneron acknowledged on Dec. 16 that its antibody treatment had “diminished potency against omicron.” And a spokesperson for Eli Lilly told WXIN-TV in Indianapolis earlier this week that its analysis showed its treatment had “reduced neutralization activity” against the variant.

Vir Biotechnology CEO George Scangos told The New York Times he believes sotrovimab is more resilient because instead of basing it on the blood of COVID-19 survivors researchers identified an antibody in the blood of a survivor from the 2003 SARS epidemic that also protected against COVID-19. SARS and COVID-19 are caused by related coronaviruses and researchers believe the antibody may attach itself to a part of the virus that has evolved very little over time.

While the federal government is working to increase the supply of sotrovimab available losing the Regeneron and Eli Lilly therapeutics is at least a temporary blow to COVID-19 treatment options at a time when cases are surging again. Nearly 68000 doses of monoclonal antibodies were administered last week according to the Department of Health and Human Services.

Dr. Bob Wachter chairman of the Department of Medicine at University of California San Francisco told The Times earlier this week that it’s a reminder that people who don't take precautions and believe there will be treatment options if they get sick are taking a gamble.

“If you have chosen to be less safe than you might have been either because of your choice of vaccines or your choice of masking it’s a riskier proposition than it would have been a couple weeks ago” he said.

The FDA and CDC this week approved two COVID-19 pills one by Pfizer and the other by Merck. But those will be in limited supply at first.

The ASPR said it is possible the Regeneron and Eli Lilly antibody treatments could still be administered in communities where the delta variant remains the dominant strain.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMS8xMi8yNC9oZWFsdGgvcHJldmVudC1jb3ZpZC0xOS1ldnVzaGVsZC9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFDaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyMS8xMi8yNC9oZWFsdGgvcHJldmVudC1jb3ZpZC0xOS1ldnVzaGVsZA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,There's a new drug to prevent Covid-19 but there won't be nearly enough for Americans who are eligible,"CNN —

For Americans who suffer from weak immune systems it felt like a miracle occurred on December 8. That day the US Food and Drug Administration authorized a drug to help keep immune-compromised people from getting infected with the coronavirus.

But that joy quickly turned to despair as patients learned the government has only contracted for enough doses for less than one-tenth the number of people who are eligible for it.

The first batch of the drug called Evusheld shipped out on Monday according to a spokesperson for the US Department of Health and Human Services. Dr. Camille Kotton an infectious disease expert at Mass General Brigham said her medical system expects to receive in this shipment only doses to treat fewer than 1% of its thousands of immune-compromised patients.

The Covid-19 vaccines worked well for many – but not all – people with suppressed immune systems leaving them vulnerable to the virus. Evusheld is a monoclonal antibody and doctors hoped to give it to their immune-compromised patients because it works in a different way than the vaccines.

“I am very concerned about the immune-compromised population” Kotton said. “I’m disappointed we don’t have better access and I hope we have better access very soon so we can prevent as much illness and potentially death in this population as possible.”

“It’s a shame that something that really could be a game changer for people who didn’t have a good vaccine response is now going to be something that is in short supply” said Dr. Dorry Segev a transplant surgeon at Johns Hopkins University and a leading researcher on vaccine effectiveness for people who are immune-compromised.

In a clinical trial with more than 5000 participants those who received Evusheld – which is given in two shots one right after the other – saw a 77% reduced risk of developing Covid-19 compared to those who received a placebo according to the FDA.

Four percent of the people in the trial were immune-compromised according to a company spokesperson but their results have not been published separately.

CNN interviewed more than two dozen Americans whose suppressed immune systems kept them from getting full protection from Covid-19 vaccines.

“I cried tears of joy when I read the headline about Evusheld. Finally we had hope and then to have it dashed – well the reality is sinking in” said Diane Barron 51.

Barron has lymphoma and rheumatoid arthritis and her immune system is weak. Blood tests show even after three doses of Pfizer’s vaccine she has no detectable antibodies against Covid-19. At high risk of dying from the virus Barron remains a virtual prisoner in her home in Fort Lauderdale Florida.

So do many other people with compromised immune systems – many transplant recipients for example or certain patients with cancers or autoimmune diseases.

About 7 million adults in the US are immune-compromised and could benefit from Evusheld according to its manufacturer AstraZeneca. The federal government which is the sole distributor of the drug has contracted for only enough doses to treat 700000 people.

The 7 million figure comes from US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention information about vaccines and the immune-compromised. The drug is also available to immune-compromised adolescents ages 12-17.

AstraZeneca does have more doses available for purchase a company spokesperson told CNN.

“The US government could purchase more doses if they wanted to” the company spokesperson wrote in an email. “We already hold inventory of finished product that exceeds near-term forecast demand and manufacturing capacity has been reserved with significant further quantities of product already in various stages of manufacture in the supply chain.”

One health official told CNN the government “is preparing to purchase significantly more Evusheld” than the 700000 doses.

That official and some others contacted by CNN asked to speak anonymously in order to candidly discuss preparations and planning.

When asked why the government thus far has contracted for only the 700000 doses Cicely Waters an HHS spokesperson said that “primary protection from COVID-19 related disease including immunocompromised populations is still through vaccination.”

But it’s likely that millions of immune-compromised people did not get protective immunity through vaccination and could benefit from a monoclonal antibody Segev told CNN.

In a clinical trial protection against Covid-19 lasted at least six months according to AstraZeneca. The trial was conducted before the arrival of the Omicron variant but the company says lab tests show Evusheld retains activity against it.

Immune-compromised people who fail to get protective immunity from Covid-19 vaccines tell CNN that the anticipated shortage of Evusheld is the latest in a long list of ways the federal government has failed to protect people who are immune-compromised.

“Frustrated. Abandoned. Forgotten. Angry” said Janet Handal a kidney transplant recipient and co-founder of an advocacy organization for transplant recipients and others who are immune-compromised when asked how people in her group feel about the government’s efforts to protect them.

When asked about the few options available to immune-compromised people a senior health official confirmed that Evusheld is the only drug available for pre-exposure prevention. The official added that the government has “built an arsenal of treatments” for people who have Covid-19 and are at risk of progressing to severe Covid-19.

“We haven’t put all eggs in one basket and we continue to grow these supplies and bring more products online to have an array of treatment tools at our disposal” the official wrote in an email to CNN.

The official said Evusheld will be distributed by states which will in turn distribute them to health care providers “in a manner consistent with clinical guidelines and recommendations for those who should receive them.”

“As always equity remains central to our planning which is why we are encouraging states to incorporate equity considerations into their distribution plans to ensure this product reaches those who need it most” the official wrote.

Warnings for months about vaccines and the immune-compromised

Handal and other patients want to know why the government contracted for only up to 700000 doses of Evusheld when it has been expected for months that many more would be needed.

In March doctors at Johns Hopkins published a research letter in the medical journal JAMA analyzing immune responses of 436 transplant recipients who had received one dose of either the Moderna or Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.

A Hopkins news release was blunt: “disappointingly” only 17% of the patients produced detectable antibodies in response to the shot.

“This is in stark contrast to people with healthy immune systems who are vaccinated nearly all of whom mount a sufficient antibody defense against COVID-19” said lead author Dr. Brian Boyarsky.

Over the next few months studies in the US and other countries emerged that with two or even three doses of Covid-19 vaccines many people with suppressed immune systems were not getting protective immunity.

The problem lies in the nature of the vaccines. They act like an instruction manual giving the immune system a recipe for how to make antibodies to the virus that causes Covid. But a suppressed immune system doesn’t always know how to read those instructions or is unable to act on them.

“They make very poor immune responses” Dr. Anthony Fauci President Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser told CNN in June. “You’re going to have to figure out – what do we need to do differently to adequately protect these people?”

Monoclonal antibodies work differently than vaccines. They don’t give instructions for how to make antibodies. They just deliver antibodies either through an infusion or shots.

In August Fauci spoke at a White House briefing about “the benefit of prevention using monoclonal antibodies” and how they could have a “major effect” in the prevention of Covid-19.

In October on CBS’s “Face the Nation” former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb called immune-compromised people one of the “pockets of vulnerability” and said that “we could be using the antibody drugs on a prophylactic basis.”

Also in October a top FDA official mentioned the need for monoclonal antibodies for some immune-compromised patients.

For people who take certain drugs for cancer or autoimmune diseases “you can pretty well bet they are not going to respond to vaccination and you probably want to be pursuing some prophylactic strategies with a monoclonal” Dr. Peter Marks director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research said at an event sponsored by the CDC and the Infectious Disease Society of America.

At the same event Dr. Myron Cohen said that “we need these monoclonal antibodies to be approved for pre-exposure prophylaxis” so that if an immune-compromised person doesn’t respond to the vaccine “we have something to give them.”

Cohen director of the Institute for Global Health and Infectious Diseases at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine discussed how doctors feel when they don’t have an alternative to offer their immune-compromised patients who failed to fully respond to the vaccines.

“It’s very upsetting to physicians the situation that we’re in right now” he said.

‘I had to DIY it’

This statistic sends chills down the spines of many immune-compromised people: Between 40-44% of fully vaccinated people who have ended up in the hospital with Covid-19 were immune-compromised according to small studies cited by the CDC.

They know that means the Covid-19 vaccines – while a miracle for so many – didn’t work well for a lot of people like them.

All summer long as the Delta variant raged through the United States killing hundreds of thousands of people the immune-compromised scrambled to try to figure out ways to protect themselves.

Handal the kidney transplant recipient says if she had listened to the FDA she might be dead by now.

In April as the studies started to accumulate French health authorities recommended third doses for severely immune-compromised people.

But in April the FDA was telling Americans – including the immune-compromised – to get two shots of Moderna or Pfizer vaccines.

Handal 71 a technology specialist who worked at the White House during the Clinton administration and now lives in New York City decided to take matters into her own hands.

As a participant in the Hopkins study she knew that two doses of Moderna had given her barely detectable levels of antibodies.

On April 28 she received a third shot of a Covid-19 vaccine after consulting with her nephrologist who said he didn’t object Handal said.

Handal’s antibodies went up significantly. While they didn’t reach levels seen in people with healthy immune systems she still felt better protected than with two shots.

More than three months later on August 12 the FDA gave emergency use authorization for a third shot for immune-compromised people. The next day the CDC made an official recommendation that immune-compromised people should get a third shot.

Handal shudders to think what might have happened to her if she’d waited for an OK from federal agencies before getting her third shot given Delta’s rampant spread in the US between April and August and how vulnerable she is with a suppressed immune system.

She knows she’s one of the lucky ones. She knew about her low antibody levels because she’s in the Hopkins study and she’s bold and was willing to defy government guidelines.

“I had to DIY it” Handal said. “The immune-compromised have been left behind in the thinking during this pandemic from the very beginning.”

“I’m trying to keep myself alive and it takes a while for the FDA and the CDC to catch up” she added. “The government has been late to the game. They’re not looking out for us so we’ve had to look out for ourselves.”

An FDA spokesperson said the agency is “committed to quickly and thoroughly” reviewing applications for emergency use authorization.

“The agency worked quickly once clinically meaningful data were available to authorize the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines to allow for the use of an additional dose in certain immunocompromised individuals. The authorization was ultimately based on the science and data available at that time as has been the case throughout the pandemic” the spokesperson Chanapa Tantibanchachai wrote in an email to CNN. “The FDA has worked around the clock throughout this pandemic to ensure the public including immune compromised individuals has access to the tools needed to best protect themselves based on the best available data on those tools.”

A CDC spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment from CNN.

Kidney transplant recipient finds a loophole

Other immune-compromised patients also say they’ve had to “DIY it.” They said once they learned that their weak immune systems had not fully responded to the Covid-19 vaccines they had to use their ingenuity to find government loopholes to get monoclonal antibodies to prevent Covid-19.

Many of them describe it as a “Hunger Games”-like endeavor to protect themselves.

Some have succeeded. Others have failed.

Cohen the UNC infectious disease expert said he often receives their desperate pleas.

“Every day I get emails – it breaks my heart” Cohen said. “It’s upsetting. They are suffering so much.”

Cohen gets these emails because patients notice he’s done research on Regeneron the first monoclonal antibody to receive emergency use authorization from the FDA.

The patients are looking for prevention but Regeneron is authorized only to treat people with Covid-19 (its most famous patient is former President Donald Trump) or who’ve been exposed to the virus.

Some patients however find loopholes.

Jef Kinney found one because he’s relentless.

In April Kinney 62 a kidney transplant recipient who lives in Oxford Maryland told his nephrologist he’d received two doses of Moderna and planned to get out of the house and start being social again.

“Basically what I got was ‘Whoa cowboy it’s going to be 2022 before you’re out and about.’ And I said ‘Pardon me?’ ” Kinney remembers. “She said ‘You need to lead your life like you’re unvaccinated.’ “

Kinney was lucky that his physician advised him that because of his weak immune system the vaccines might not have been very effective for him. Handal and many other members of the patient organization she co-founded the Transplant Recipients and Immunocompromised Patient Advocacy Group say last spring and summer as Delta raged doctors and transplant centers typically did not reach out to patients to give them this warning.

Fully advised Kinney a self-described “data hog” got to work.

A retired vice president at Fannie Mae of innovation development he’s accustomed to doing research and quickly found the Hopkins studies and emailed Segev one of the authors.

Segev wrote back and Kinney joined the study and learned he did not have any detectable antibodies from his two doses of Moderna.

“I felt pretty naked out there with no protection” he said.

Kinney found an article online that mentioned Leah Lipsich an executive at Regeneron. He sent her an email and Lipsich connected him to the team that runs the company’s “compassionate use” program.

Under compassionate use doctors can ask Regeneron and the FDA for permission to use the company’s monoclonal antibody drug under certain circumstances.

Kinney asked one of his doctors to submit the necessary paperwork and the doctor declined. Other immune-compromised people said their doctors also turned them down because compassionate use applications involve paperwork and the doctors told them they did not have time to do it for all their immune-compromised patients.

Kinney’s family physician whom he describes as a “small town doc” agreed to submit the paperwork but then he hit another snag. For compassionate use applications doctors are required to get permission from an Institutional Review Board. While medical centers have such boards in-house typically individual doctors don’t.

Months passed as Kinney and his doctor worked on the compassionate use application. Then Kinney received an email that his nephrologist who works at a large medical center had agreed to submit his paperwork for compassionate use. Kinney finally received his first dose of Regeneron’s monoclonal antibody in November after a seven-month effort to get the drug.

“Let me tell you if I hadn’t been on top of this none of this would have happened” Kinney said. “You need to be smart and you need to be persistent. It’s a hard slog to get people to engage.”

“I’m very aggressive in pursuing people. I realize there are people who don’t have the resources to do that or who don’t know how to do that or would look at a doctor and say ‘Well I can’t be bothering a doctor.’ I don’t have those issues.”

Cancer patient finds another loophole

Lisa Wiest managed to get monoclonal antibodies to prevent Covid-19 because she knows how to think on her feet.

Wiest who has chronic lymphocythic leukemia learned last spring that her Covid-19 vaccinations had given her barely detectable levels of antibodies.

While her friends and family were getting protection from their vaccines Wiest who was 50 at the time felt vulnerable and unprotected.

In August Wiest a federal employee who lives in Rochester New York heard that the state of Florida had set up clinics to give monoclonal antibodies. On a trip to visit a friend there in September she went to a clinic in Clearwater that was offering Regeneron’s antibodies to qualified patients.

Wiest told the nurse at the clinic that she had a blood cancer and had received very little antibody response to her first two shots. She thought that would be enough to get the Regeneron infusion.

It wasn’t.

While the European Commission has authorized Regeneron’s drug for prevention the FDA has not. In the US Regeneron is only authorized to treat certain people who have Covid-19 or who have been exposed to the virus meaning they have been within six feet of someone with Covid-19 for a total of 15 minutes or more. Wiest didn’t fall into either category.

But the FDA left some wiggle room and Wiest jumped on it.

The FDA allows someone to get Regeneron if they are immune-compromised and are “in the same institutional setting” as people who have Covid “for example nursing homes or prisons.”

The wiggle room patients have found is in the phrase “for example” – someone doesn’t have to actually be in a nursing home or prison to be eligible to get the drug.

Wiest explained to the nurse that her husband is a pastor and since Covid-19 was rampant in their community potentially she was exposed every Sunday in church.

That didn’t cut it.

Then she told the nurse that she’d just gotten off a three-hour flight.

Wiest says that did the trick. The nurse gave her an infusion of Regeneron’s monoclonal antibodies.

While relieved to get the medicine Wiest wishes the federal government would make it easier for people like her to get protected against Covid-19.

“I would like to see the powers that be listen to our little voice. We’re a small group but we’re genuinely upset that the vaccine didn’t work for many of us. Even with Evusheld we’re going to have to fight and advocate for ourselves” she said.

The state of Florida did not return emails from CNN asking about standards at the state-run clinics.

In early June Regeneron asked the FDA to expand its emergency use authorization to include prevention for everyone who is immune-compromised according to Dr. George Yancopolous Regeneron’s president and chief scientific officer.

“We assumed that it was going to happen rapidly and these people would be protected” Yancopolous said. “We are disappointed that there hasn’t been faster action on this.”

“We don’t want to antagonize the FDA” Yancopolous added. “They’re pulled in so many directions and [immune-compromised] people sort of fell into a hole.”

Chanapa Tantibanchachai the FDA spokesperson said the agency is “committing to quickly and thoroughly reviewing all submitted applications including requests for Emergency Use Authorization to speed patient access to medicines to prevent or treat COVID-19 provided they meet the agency’s rigorous standards.”

A Christmas miracle

Much has changed since Kinney and Wiest fought to get monoclonal antibodies this summer and fall. HHS and the FDA say it is “unlikely” that Regeneron “will retain activity” against the Omicron variant.

Evusheld however retains neutralizing ability against the highly transmissible variant according to AstraZeneca.

As immune-compromised patients wait to see if they’ll be one of the relatively few to get a dose of Evusheld all doctors can do is tell their immune-compromised patients to be careful about masking and social distancing – and to get vaccinated.

In October the CDC told the immune-compromised they may get a fourth shot at least six months after their third shot of Pfizer or Moderna.

Even though immune-compromised people often don’t have a robust antibody response to the vaccine it’s still important to get vaccinated because the shots could help improve other parts of the immune system besides antibodies that are more difficult to measure Segev said.

Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.

For weeks Barron the lymphoma and rheumatoid arthritis patient in Florida called the state health department and her physicians nearly every day trying to get one of the precious doses of Evusheld allocated to her state.

She made calls to help other immune-compromised patients get the drug too. She says she’s helping others in the spirit of and in honor of her beloved cousin who died of the virus last summer.

Dr. Clinton Potter who practiced in Naples Florida cared for patients with HIV/AIDS and championed the rights of the LBGT community. Like Barron he was fully vaccinated but had cancer and a suppressed immune system.

“When he died I cried because I was lost in grief but also because he was in my position. I sobbed for it all – for my vulnerability for not knowing what was going to take me out of this” Barron said.

This past week she worked with particular fervor: Ten close family members all of them fully vaccinated tested positive for Covid-19.

Then on Thursday she received a text message.

“Looks like I’ve received a Christmas miracle” she wrote to CNN.”Got a text tonight. I have an appointment to get one of the first and few doses of Evusheld at noon tomorrow Dec 24.”

She wrote that she’s getting the shots “thanks to relentless persistence Janet’s group and sheer luck” referring to the support group for people with compromised immune systems.

She thinks of her cousin all the time. Before he died of Covid in August she often turned to him for guidance on how to stay alive in the pandemic as an immune-compromised person. After he passed away she felt more alone than ever.

“It’s such a lonely place. … It’s very disheartening and frustrating” she said. “You just feel like you’re completely figuring it out on your own.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMisQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wb3N0LWdhemV0dGUuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2hlYWx0aGNhcmUtYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAyMS8xMi8yMy9vbWljcm9uLWNvdmlkLTE5LW1lZGljaW5lLXBoYXJtYWN5LW1vbm9jbG9uYWwtYW50aWJvZGllcy1waXR0c2J1cmdoLWFsbGVnaGVueS1jb3VudHktcGEvc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIxMTIyMzAxNzbSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New COVID-19 medicines: Almost here but not easy to find,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld2luZGlhbmV4cHJlc3MuY29tL3dvcmxkLzIwMjEvRGVjLzI1L2V4cGxhaW5lci13aGF0LWNvdmlkLTE5LXRoZXJhcGllcy1jdXJyZW50bHktYXJlLWF2YWlsYWJsZS1pbi11cy0yMzk5NDAxLmh0bWzSAYkBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmV3aW5kaWFuZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vYW1wL3N0b3J5L3dvcmxkLzIwMjEvRGVjLzI1L2V4cGxhaW5lci13aGF0LWNvdmlkLTE5LXRoZXJhcGllcy1jdXJyZW50bHktYXJlLWF2YWlsYWJsZS1pbi11cy0yMzk5NDAxLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,EXPLAINER | What COVID-19 therapies currently are available in US?,"World

The 17-year-old enlisted two friends to help keep him awake for 264 hours in a project he thought was a surefire way to win first place at the San Diego science fair.

On day one he reported he was feeling focused and ready for the challenge by day four he was hallucinating that he was a football player twice his actual size.

Over the course of the experiment Gardner lost his ability to identify objects by touch had trouble forming short-term memories and struggled to repeat basic tongue twisters.

By the final day when asked to subtract seven repeatedly starting with 100 he stopped at 65. When asked why he stopped Gardner said he forgot what he was doing.

While he and his friends indeed took out that first prize at the science fair and became media sensations years later Gardner reported suffering from intense insomnia.

His experiment represents one of the most vivid examples of the importance of rest and is the reason the Guinness World Records stopped publishing the record for most consecutive days awake.

“Sleep has shown to have positive effects on our cognition memory mental functioning and so much more” says Prof Shanthakumar Rajaratnam chair of the Sleep Health Foundation.

“When we sleep our brain is processing the events of the day eliminating toxins in our brains and it plays a critical role in our ability to learn new things.

“We simply can’t live well without it.”

All of this begs the question what actually is sleep?

While research about the importance of sleep has only grown over the decades according to the Sleep Health Foundation scientists still don’t quite understand why this mysterious yet crucial function is so badly needed.

Prof Rajaratnam says that while sleep is generally believed to be a dormant activity there’s actually a lot more happening in the brain than we think.

“For a long time it was believed sleep is a process in which the brain’s activity decreases but there is now very clear research that many processes actually become more active during sleep” he says.

“Some parts of the brain use more oxygen and glucose while asleep than when awake.”

Studies have shown that while asleep the body restores cells releases proteins and hormones and restores energy levels.

In some good news for Canberrans the capital may actually be the best place in the world for getting some shut-eye.

A report from Lenstore this year found that in categories such as temperature light pollution noise air quality and more Canberra had the best conditions for quality rest.

Second on the list was Vienna in Austria whereas the worst city in the world for sleep was Washington DC which has more people searching for “sleeping pills” online than any other city in the world.

“It might surprise you to know that your brain has a kind of clock in it” says Prof Rajaratnam.

“The most important external signal for the biological clock is light. When the eye senses light it sends signals to the suprachiasmatic nucleus [which] resets the clock every day.

“Our body does this to make sure rhythms don’t drift out of line with the environment.”

Prof Rajaratnam explains this biological system has evolved over millions of years and as a result relies heavily on consistency.

“Try to go to bed at around the same time every evening and get up at around the same time every morning” he says.

“Improved sleep will not happen as soon as changes are made but if good sleep habits are maintained sleep will certainly get better. Find what time works for you and stick with it.”

Potentially interfering with this consistency is napping something that Australians are doing more than ever before according to new research from ResMed.

Its study found almost half the nation is taking a siesta once a week having increased as a result of working from home due to covid lockdowns.

Is napping good for us though?

While Prof Rajaratnam says sometimes a nap is necessary it shouldn’t ever replace a good night’s sleep.

“We often feel most sleepy in the early afternoon around 2pm-3pm. Being able to sleep during a nap may be easier at this time of day than trying to nap at another time” he says.

Over the holidays the Sleep Health Foundation says it’s important to remember getting a good sleep is just as important as a good diet and regular exercise. Happy hay hitting.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Tight ends coach Ron Middleton will handle Saleh's duties on Sunday. Middleton a longtime NFL and college assistant who previously worked with Saleh has been running the Jets' practices since Saleh tested positive for COVID-19 on Wednesday morning.

Saleh said Friday that he was feeling ""good"" and hopeful that he would test negative on Friday and Saturday allowing him to clear the league's protocols. But he admitted that the team was ""operating"" as if he would not be coaching the game.

The Jets still had 16 players including four from the practice squad on the reserve/COVID-19 list after 4 p.m. Saturday making them ineligible to play Sunday. That means the Jets will be without several key contributors including six starters because of COVID: left guard Alijah Vera Tucker right guard Laurent Duvernay-Tardif defensive end John Franklin-Myers defensive tackle Folorunso Fatukasi slot cornerback Michael Carter II and safety Ashtyn Davis.

Wide receiver Elijah Moore and tight end Ryan Griffin are also key players on the COVID list but both were moved there from injured reserve and wouldn't have played anyway.

The Jets are also likely to be without wide receiver Jamison Crowder (calf) who didn't practice this week and was listed as ""doubtful"" on the team's final injury report. The Jets also announced that quarterback coach Rob Calabrese will not coach Sunday because of COVID protocols and senior offensive assistant Matt Cavanaugh would cover his responsibilities.

Bottom line: rookie quarterback Zach Wilson faces a huge challenge without his head coach on the sideline and likely playing without his top three receivers both of his starting guards and his top tight end target.

It’s hard but it isn’t hard"" Middleton said when asked about the uncertainty caused by their COVID issues this week. ""You can only control the things you can control and you have no control over who’s going to pop or who you’re going to have. You just have to work the ones that you have and prepare with the ones that you have. Tomorrow isn’t promised to you. Live for the day and take advantage of it of the opportunity and situation that you’re in right then.""

Middleton said Friday that he had been mentally preparing to coach the game since Saleh notified the staff of his positive test about 45 minutes before the team took the field for its walkthrough on Wednesday.

Saleh chose Middleton because of his experience and their past relationship — Middleton and Saleh were together with the Jaguars for three seasons when Saleh was the linebackers coach there from 2014-16.

Middleton said that the plan was for him and Saleh to have an ""extensive"" conversation Saturday about how he'd be handling game-management situations like potential challenges and fourth-down go no-go calls. Middleton said he's monitored the in-game communication between Saleh and Matt Burke the Jets' game management coach. But he didn't reveal any details about the process because he had yet to have to conversation with Saleh.

This will be Middleton's first time acting as a head coach during a game — he said earlier this week that his closest prior experience was running a practice at Duke where he was an associate head coach.

The circumstances are strange and less than ideal but the 56-year-old said that he eager for the opportunity to coach if Saleh couldn't return.

""Very much so looking forward to it"" Middleton said. "" You know earlier in my career that [being a head coach] was the goal. And as you age your goals change take different paths and what not. But yeah I’ve always wanted to be a head coach and I just appreciate Robert giving me this opportunity to get a taste of it. It’s been great.""

Middleton smiled when he was asked if he planned to mark the occasion with a fiery pre-game speech Sunday.

""I don’t know"" Middleton said. ""I think I’m a pretty emotional person. I’m very passionate about football. I usually just let it happen so I don’t have anything planned. ... I’m just going to let it happen.""

Bankers with lots of money say it doesn ...,"2021 has not been a normal year. One final piece of evidence for its abnormality is that the standard seasonality of the banking recruitment market seems to have been upended. Headhunters are saying that they’re seeing as much as three times the usual level of activity in the fourth quarter. Since few investment bankers are going to be looking around in December this year in anticipation of a disappointing bonus round that means that there are firms out there who are prepared to buy out the entire 2021 compensation package effectively paying up for work they never benefited from. And according to Kevin Mahoney at Bay Street Advisors they’re paying a premium to do so – MD bonuses are being seen up 20-30% across the industry but some banks are prepared to pay total compensation increases of as much as 50% in the hottest sectors like tech and healthcare.

Not only that but clients are increasingly asking for “lift-out” deals. This is where you hire a senior MD and simultaneously make offers to all of his or her direct reports. Banks are often a bit nervous about doing this sort of thing – it makes your competition very angry and there can be some tricky legal issues raised if it is too obvious that you’ve been coordinating the move.

But for heads of investment banking who started the year in a cautious frame of mind and are now playing catch-up not being adequately staffed right now is unthinkable. The pipeline of deals for January looks just as strong as it did in 2021 and every month of 2022 that you’re understaffed will be one full of missed revenue opportunities. It seems that heads of department are rationalizing their December hiring strategies to themselves by presuming that even if they’re paying slightly over the odds they ought to make it back in revenue terms.

That could be a risky move of course. Anyone making an offer today will be doing incredibly well to get things closed by the year-end. And given that the vast majority of MDs will need to take three months’ gardening leave that means that your new expensive hire will be walking through the door at the end of March. With the time needed to give everyone their new phone number get new pitch books produced and so on a new rainmaker will be aiming to generate revenue in whatever market conditions prevail at the end of April – potentially mid-May.

This matters if you're a banker because the other difference from previous hiring cycles is that there seems to be much less use of multi-year guarantees. This means that the end-year hires are not quite as expensive as they look because although there’s an upfront signing-on bonus there’s no commitment for 2022 (beyond a degree of unenforceable “indication”) and certainly not for 2023. Anyone taking one of these big offers would be well advised to line up a few quick wins to impress the new boss as early as possible.

Elsewhere Spear’s the magazine for really rich people ends the year in philosophical mood asking “what does it all mean”? Of course it’s better to be rich than poor if only for financial reasons but once you’ve become an ultra-high-net-worth individual do you have to do some good with it if you want people to respect you? The answer appears to be yes.

Many of the people giving the message of philanthropy are super-successful bankers like John Studzinski and Guy Hands. But Morris Pearl former BlackRock MD gives an entire life cycle of what it’s like to feel rich. When you’re very young it means being able to buy a sandwich from the posh deli. A bit later on it’s owning a nice commuter house. Once you’ve had kids wealth means being able to tell them that they don’t need to worry about paying for college. And then finally (we think a few interim stages might have been skipped) you start feeling truly wealthy when you’ve got so many philanthropic activities going on that you need to hire a staff to manage them. What’s actually most interesting is that none of the people interviewed seemed to use the traditional banker’s measure of what it means to be rich; having that crucial bit more than the person on the desk opposite you.

This is our last Morning Coffee until January 4th. Wishing you all a happy healthy Christmas and a prosperous New Year. See you in 2022!

Apparently part of the reason why so many senior finance people are considering running for political office is that they’re following in the footsteps of Glenn Youngkin formerly of Carlyle Group who was elected Governor of Virginia last month and proved that being a banker is no longer political Kryptonite – the popular villains are social media executives and opiate producers these days. (Financial News)

The company isn’t commenting and Morgan Stanley’s review of its losses on Turkish lira options in 2019 hasn’t been published but the fact that Rodrigo Jolig is no longer working there (his boss Thiago Melzer left the firm in June) suggests that some career limiting moves were made. FINRA filings suggest that “communications about business using an unapproved platform” may have been involved. (Bloomberg)

While many stores had extended hours in the days leading up to Christmas Eve the majority will close early Friday.

For the second holiday shopping season of the pandemic retailers started rolling out deals early to spread out demand. This year consumers were encouraged to also start early because of supply chain constraints.

Those ongoing constraints might be one reason more people will shop in-stores or take advantage of curbside pickup or on-demand delivery.

More people are also off from work. While Christmas Eve is not a federal holiday many businesses and federal offices are recognizing it as a day off because Christmas falls on a Saturday. The stock market is closed Friday.

Adding to the existing mono-brand stores at The Gardens Mall and Pavilion Kuala Lumpur Bell and Ross seeks to elevate the local retail landscape by launching a mono-brand boutique at luxury wonderland Pavilion Bukit Jalil and a permanent pop-up store at 1 Utama Shopping Centre in Petaling Jaya.

Malaysia is currently the proudest home to the watchmaker’s largest mono brand presence in a single country with four standalone stores and more in the pipeline.

Each boutique references the standards set by brand co-founder Bruno Belamich who spearheads the Creative Studio of Bell & Ross. Clean lines smooth surfaces and a monochromatic palette set the background for noble materials and watch models to do the talking.

br_pavilion_bukit_jalil_2.jpg A casual elegance permeates the space swathed in monolithic black marble at the Pavilion Bukit Jalil boutique

Aviation cues dominate the interior of the Pavilion Bukit Jalil boutique all bedecked in concrete floor reminiscent of tarmacs and aircraft hangars while luminous bands on the ceiling recall the signing of landing strips. The imagery continues in more literal forms too sporting black-and-white prints of aviation scenes including a life-sized portrait of a pilot in a cockpit and small displays of aircraft models.

A casual elegance permeates the space swathed in monolithic black marble which symbolises preciousness and prestige of the brand’s propositions. While aeronautics is a driving force behind the statement interiors the watchmaker’s well-rounded oeuvre holds pride of place throughout the boutique with individual sections dedicated to its aviation diver Formula One and urban collections.

br_1utama_1.jpg Aviation is once again the reference of choice in the décor for the 1 Utama pop-up store

On the other hand the pop-up store at 1 Utama displays the same mineral texture this time sans the gentle warmth of wood. Aviation is once again the reference of choice in the décor accentuated by contrasting black and white elements to exude an atmosphere of immaculate precision. Touches of concrete marble and glass add to the vibe of the store which now has stations around the room to pay homage to the different collections. While the Bukit Jalil boutique embraced soft opulence the 1 Utama store is an edgier expression of the multi-faceted brand.

Eagle-eyed watch aficionados would have paid attention to Bell & Ross' boutique-exclusive editions. Take for example the 2011 Asia-only revamp of three key models in the BR 01 collection. The ensuing limited-edition BR 01 RADAR (Singapore) BR 01 Compass (Indonesia) and BR 01 SKULL (Greater China) in red blue and green respectively reflect the colours and tools used in professional flight navigation. In a clever spin the idea of the fun BR 01 CASINO watch was inspired by a roulette as a dial.

br_1utama_4.jpg Touches of concrete marble and glass add to the vibe of the store

Exclusive to boutiques this year is the BR 05 HOROLUM limited to 250 pieces. Paying tribute to the minimalist and technical forms of modern buildings the new timepiece adopts more urban more mineral references.

Valentina Orellana-Peralta was shopping with her mother for a quinceanera dress and inside a dressing room when she was apparently struck by the bullet from a Los Angeles Police Department officer.

The officer who fired the shot that killed Orellana-Peralta was paced on administrative leave while the investigation is ongoing police announced Friday.

Police were called to the Burlington store at 12121 Victory Blvd. near Laurel Canyon Boulevard at about 11:45 a.m Thursday after receiving a 911 call from a person who reported hearing shots fired and arguing inside the store according to the LAPD.

As officers were responding to the call the LAPD received additional reports of a possible active shooter Capt. Stacy Spell said.

""As the officers were responding they arrived at this location and began a search looking for a suspect"" Spell said. ""While conducting that search for a suspect the officers encountered an individual who was in the process of assaulting another and an officer-involved shooting occurred.""

The suspect was fatally shot in the chest police said. He was identified Friday by the Los Angeles County coroner's office as 24-year-old Daniel Elena Lopez a man with a considerable criminal history.

LAPD Assistant Chief Dominic Choi said that during a subsequent search police found a hole in a stretch of drywall that was in front of the officer or officers who opened fire at the suspect.

""We went behind it (the wall) and it turned out to be a dressing room up there"" Choi said. ""… We were able to locate a 14-year-old female who was found deceased in that dressing room.""

Asked if the girl was shot by police Choi said ""Preliminarily we believe that round was an officer's round.""

Choi said it was unclear whether the suspect was armed.

""We did not find a gun"" he said. ""However until the coroner gets here and we do a full search of the suspect that won't be definitive. But right now we haven't located a firearm.""

Officers did find a ""steel or metal cable lock a very heavy lock"" near the suspect that may have been used in the assault Choi said.

A woman who was being assaulted by the suspect when officers arrived was taken to a hospital in unknown condition. She was seen in video footage from the scene being loaded into an ambulance awake but bloodied.

The Los Angeles Times reported that Elena Lopez has convictions for car theft carrying a loaded gun in public and carrying a gun as a felon.

The newspaper also reported that he was arrested in the San Fernando Valley in August 2020 and charged with domestic battery stealing a car and recklessly fleeing the police later pleading guilty to domestic battery and fleeing police and sentenced to two years in state prison.

A spokeswoman for the state corrections department declined to release Elena Lopez's commitment history to The Times citing the ongoing investigation into the North Hollywood shooting.

""This chaotic incident resulting in the death of an innocent child is tragic and devastating for everyone involved"" LAPD Chief Michel Moore who was out of town with family but briefed on the shooting said in a statement.

""I am profoundly sorry for the loss of this young girl's life and I know there are no words that can relieve the unimaginable pain for the family.

My commitment is to conduct a thorough complete and transparent investigation into the circumstances that led up to this tragedy and provide the family and public with as much information as possible"" the chief added.

Moore said he directed critical incident video from the scene to be released by Monday. The release will include 911 calls radio transmissions body-worn video and any surveillance video gathered.

Moore told The Times it did not appear that the officer who fired ""would have known that there was anyone behind there or that he was looking at anyone other than the suspect and a wall"" but said every aspect of what occurred and why would be analyzed by LAPD investigators.

The LAPD Family Liaison is working closely with the Mayor's Crisis Response Team and Councilwoman Monica Rodriguez to provide assistance to the 14year-old girl's family a department official said.

The department's Force Investigation Division and Inspector General's Office were both on the scene investigating Choi said.

The California Department of Justice's California Police Shooting Investigation Team for Southern California was also deployed to the shooting scene and is continuing to investigate under provisions of a bill signed into law last year by Gov. Gavin Newsom that went into effect July 1 state Attorney General Rob Bonta announced.

Once the investigation has been completed the results will be turned over to the California Department of Justice's Special Prosecutions Section within the Criminal Law Division for independent review.

""Two things I promise is to be deliberate and thorough and to be totally transparent"" Mayor Eric Garcetti said Friday. ""That's what everybody deserves that we get to the bottom of what happened and share [it] with the public. It's just a horrible horrible tragedy""

At least two Los Angeles mayoral candidates have also commented on the shooting.

""As a father my heart breaks over Valentina Orellana-Peralta"" Councilman Kevin De Leon tweeted Friday. ""A daughter of LA killed by someone tasked with keeping her safe. When something like this happens it's on us as city leaders to take ownership -- and take responsibility for changing the course of history.

""We owe it to Valentina's family to hear the results of the city and state investigations make the necessary changes and make sure we never lose another Angeleno this way.""

Rep. Karen Bass D-Los Angeles tweeted late Thursday night that ""It is an absolute tragedy that there will be an empty seat at this 14 year-old child's family table in two days. Everyone in this city deserves to be safe.

""I'm glad there will be an investigation and await further information regarding what happened today."""

And at the same time as cases surge shoreside the numbers of coronavirus cases reported on cruise ships are starting to stack up again.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been working with global public health experts and industry partners to learn about omicron spokesperson Dave Daigle told USA TODAY Thursday. ""We are still learning how easily it spreads the severity of illness it causes and how well available vaccines and medications work against it.""

While it is unclear whether the cruise industry could shut down again like it did in March 2020 it doesn't seem likely.

So with the news of cruises experiencing more cases on board and ports of call taking their own precautions as we've seen happen on ships like Carnival Cruise Line's Carnival Freedom and Royal Caribbean International's Odyssey of the Seas travelers may be weighing whether they want to proceed or postpone their cruise plans. Let's walk through what you need to consider:

The choice to cancel or not can be personal

Cruzely.com founder Tanner Callais told USA TODAY he thinks the decision is personal and based on one's ""risk tolerance.""

""Assuming you are otherwise healthy then you may think it is fine to sail"" he continued. ""There are risks but we've seen that there are risks in any group of people be it in a restaurant theme park or stadium. If you plan to be in close interaction with others then cruises have the strongest requirements of any group setting I can think of.""

But he added others may want to cancel if they have underlying conditions are unvaccinated or are in contact with others who may be at risk.

""Personally I've taken several cruises since they've returned but I'm holding off on sailing for a month or two until things have calmed down"" Callais said. ""With daily contact with a family member that has health issues I think there's no harm in putting off travel until cases fall.""

The CDC advises people who are not fully vaccinated against COVID-19 to avoid cruise travel and advises travelers to get a booster shot if eligible Daigle said.

Be prepared for a potentially different vacation if you keep your cruise

While the cruise industry hasn't stopped operations and lines haven't canceled cruises themselves a cruise vacation may look different as coronavirus begins to spread more rapidly.

Cruise attorney Michael Winkleman told USA TODAY he doesn't think cruisers necessarily should cancel but ""they should expect the unexpected and be ready to deal with itinerary changes.""

Your itinerary could change – including port stops

Some itinerary changes have already occurred on sailings with coronavirus cases on board.

Holland America's Koningsdam ship skipped a port call at Puerto Vallarta Mexico spokesperson Erik Elvejord confirmed to USA TODAY Sunday.

The ship had ""small number of fully-vaccinated crew on Koningsdam tested positive for COVID-19"" Holland America said without specifying the number of crew who tested positive. No passengers tested positive.

And Carnival Freedom had to change its itinerary due to COVID-19 too. The ship has an undisclosed ""small number"" of coronavirus cases on board and is following protocols spokesperson AnneMarie Mathews told USA TODAY Thursday.

Aruba and Bonaire did not permit Carnival Freedom to call at their ports.

When port visits are canceled she said the cruise line will try to find an alternative destination.

Royal Caribbean's Odyssey of the Seas has also had to make itinerary changes including canceling port calls due to at least 55 cases of coronavirus on board.

On Wednesday Royal Caribbean announced that the cruise will not stop in Curacao or Aruba as planned.

""The decision was made together with the islands and out of an abundance of caution due to the current trend of cases in the destination communities and having COVID-19 positive cases on board ... representing 1.1% of the onboard community"" according to a statement shared by Lyan Sierra-Caro spokesperson for the cruise line.

The ship also returned briefly to port on Sunday to disembark a passenger with COVID-19.

When asked if cruisers can expect more itineraries to be altered the CDC's Daigle said the health agency ""can't predict the future of cruising or actions of port authorities.""

""We can tell you that CDC’s Temporary Extension & Modification of Framework for Conditional Sailing Order requires cruise ship operators to document the approval of U.S. port and local health authorities in developing medical care housing and port components of an agreement"" Daigle said Thursday.

Some lines are tightening onboard restrictions

Cruise lines including Carnival Cruise Line Norwegian Cruise Line and Royal Caribbean International have already made moves to tighten onboard restrictions.

Carnival Cruise Line updated its mask policy last week for sailings through Jan. 31 as omicron continues to spread.

Norwegian too added mask requirements for indoor areas.

Last month Norwegian also extended its vaccination requirement for 100% of passengers indefinitely.

Similarly Royal Caribbean told passengers in a note last week that it would tighten mask restrictions through Jan. 5.

And Holland America said in a statement to USA TODAY Sunday that ""current operating procedures require all team members and guests to wear a mask in all indoor areas of the ship and all areas are frequently disinfected.""

Some cruise lines have flexible cancellation policies others are adding

Options for canceling cruises vary by line. Canceling doesn't always mean a full refund it may mean a future cruise credit and some lines are stricter than others but some have more flexible options as a result of the ongoing pandemic.

Royal Caribbean International Celebrity Cruises Silversea Cruises

Royal Caribbean Group's ""Cruise with Confidence"" program has been in place since March 2020 and applies to flagship line Royal Caribbean International Silversea Cruises and Celebrity Cruises Sierra-Caro told USA TODAY on Wednesday.

""It allows guests to cancel up to 48 hours before their departure – for any reason at all – and get 100% of the value back in a Future Cruise Credit that they can use towards any sailing"" Sierra-Caro said.

If a passenger or someone in their party tests positive for COVID-19 before the cruise is set to depart they can also get a 100% fare refund.

Carnival Cruise Line

Carnival Cruise Line warned passengers scheduled to cruise through Jan. 14 in an email obtained by USA TODAY that itinerary changes may happen as a result of omicron's spread – and said no refunds would be issued for missed port stops beyond pre-purchased excursions.

""We recognize that given the circumstances some of our guests may want to consider sailing at a different time"" the cruise line continued noting that passengers should contact the company their travel agent or planner to rebook or cancel for a full refund.

The line has had options in place for passengers impacted by COVID-19 who need to cancel.

Holland America Line

Holland America Line a Carnival Corp. cruise line has a ""flexible"" cancellation policy that is in place for cruises booked by Feb. 28 for ships departing through April 30.

""You can cancel for any reason up to 30 days before departure and automatically receive a Future Cruise Credit with our Flexible Cancellation"" the cruise line says on its website. ""Additionally you may cancel up to your sailing date if you test positive for COVID-19 and will also receive a Future Cruise Credit.""

Norwegian Cruise Line

Norwegian Cruise Line has in place a ""Peace of Mind"" policy for pandemic bookings.

For cruises departing through March passengers can cancel up to 61 days ahead of sailing for a full refund.

MSC Cruises

For bookings made through March 31 2022 for cruises through March 31 2023 passengers can change their cruise up to 48 hours ahead of departure.

""They can move their money to another cruise that sails on or before March 31 2023 (any ship any sail date without penalty)"" Stephen Schuler vice president of communications for MSC told USA TODAY on Wednesday. ""The only exception to this is guests booked on MSC World Cruise or World Cruise segments.""

Shah (Bloomberg) Royal Caribbean Cruises diverted a ship from planned stops in Curacao and Aruba after cases of Covid-19 broke out on board the second such report in less than a week.

The Odyssey of the Seas has 55 confirmed positive cases among guests and crew members amounting to 1.1% of the total number of people on board the cruise company said Thursday. All of the cases involve fully vaccinated people who reported no symptoms or mild symptoms.

The company has also identified close contacts and placed them in quarantine before testing. The ship sailed with 95% of the people on board fully vaccinated. On Dec. 19 another Royal Caribbean ship arrived in Miami after an outbreak.

“The decision was made together with the islands out of an abundance of caution” Lyan Sierra-Caro a company spokeswoman said in the statement.

The fast-spreading omicron variant is complicating the cruise industry’s attempt to recover from last year’s shutdowns. As the pandemic spread in early 2020 some countries refused to let exposed passengers disembark at ports. Competitor Carnival Corp. this week predicted a return to profit in the second half of 2022.

Odyssey of the Seas has no more scheduled ports of call and will have “sea days” until its scheduled return on Dec. 26 to Fort Lauderdale Sierra-Caro said.

Shares of Miami-based Royal Caribbean fell less than 1% to $79.02 at 11:31 a.m. in New York. The stock was up 6.4% this year through Wednesday’s close.

Royal Caribbean requires pre-cruise testing for all guests weekly testing of all crew members and vaccinations for all crew and guests age 12 and older among other safety measures the company said.

Choose a cruise deal with airfare included or book an air-cruise package and your cruise purchase can really be one-stop shopping. You always get transportation food and lodging all in one price with a cruise but book your airfare through your cruise line and you'll take care of the majority of your travel plans in one transaction.

But should you book your flights through your cruise line? While doing so can offer various benefits you will want to consider whether the pros outweigh any cons. The answer will depend on your particular travel situation and whether you're contemplating a cruise with flights included in the deal or simply paying for flights through your cruise line.

Learn more about the benefits and drawbacks of cruise and flight packages to determine whether it's a smart move to book your flights via your cruise line.

5 reasons why you should book your flight through your cruise line

The airfare can be a good deal

Some high-end cruise lines include flights as a booking perk. Oceania Cruises offers economy airfare with the most inclusive (and expensive) of its three OLife Choice promotion tiers while Regent Seven Seas Cruises lures travelers with free business-class flights to Europe. It's hard to find a better deal than free even if you might not have as much control over your booking as you'd like.

Even cruise lines selling you flights claim to have low rates. Royal Caribbean claims that its airfares are so competitive that it will refund you 110% of the difference in onboard credit if you can find a cheaper flight. It makes sense that cruise lines' in-house travel agencies can get access to the lowest rates or bulk fares not available to the general public.

You'll still earn points and miles

Buying a cruise line air package is similar to purchasing flights through a travel agent. You can add your frequent flyer number to the reservation to earn miles and access your elite perks — but watch out for extremely discounted fares that might not qualify. Plus if you pay with a rewards-earning credit card you'll also get points or miles for your purchase.

TPG pro tip: Look for credit cards that earn extra points on travel purchases so your cruise-and-flight purchase can earn you free travel faster. Among our top-rated credit cards for travel are the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card which gives you 2 Ultimate Rewards points per dollar spent on travel purchases and the Chase Sapphire Reserve which offers 3 points per dollar on travel.

The cruise line will assist you with travel disruptions

The cruise line's travel department has the back of all cruisers who purchased flights through them. If your flight is delayed due to weather or a mechanical problem agents will assist you with rebooking. Should the flight issues lead to you missing your ship the line will make arrangements to get you to the next port of call.

The same is true if your cruise ends unexpectedly early due to weather mechanical issues or an illness outbreak. The cruise line's air department will rebook cruise passengers who booked their flights through the cruise line but independent travelers will be left to fend for themselves.

You can book now and pay later

Are you a planner and book your cruise a year in advance? With airline change fees you might not want to pay for airfare months in advance in case your plans change. Some cruise lines' air-cruise packages such as Carnival Cruise Line's Fly2Fun Air Program and Holland America's Flight Ease allow you to pay for your flights when your final cruise payment is due (typically about 90 days prior to sailing) rather than at the time of booking.

Cruise lines don't charge booking fees

Cruise lines will not charge you service or convenience fees to book your flights through their air departments. You only have to pay the airfare and the applicable airline taxes and fees.

5 reasons not to book your flight through your cruise line

You can't pay with miles

If you'd love to book your flights with credit card points or airline miles you'll need to do that through the airline not the cruise line.

You might also want to watch out if you hope to pay for coach airfare through your cruise line and then upgrade with miles. As cruise lines often negotiate special low rates with the airlines these fare classes are often ineligible for mileage or elite upgrades.

Cruise lines charge deviation fees for custom itineraries

Some cruise line air bookings come with restrictions around when you can fly. Should you wish to arrive several days early or spend a week in the area after your cruise perhaps even flying home from a nearby city you might need to pay the cruise line a deviation fee of a few hundred dollars.

You can't always pick your airline schedule or flight routing

Many cruise lines now offer choice and flexibility with airline arrangements letting you pick your airline travel time and routing. However some of the cheaper more restrictive options leave the booking exclusively to the cruise line's air department allowing you no say in your flight route — unless you pay the aforementioned deviation fee or pay more for a flexible booking option. For example with Viking you'd need to upgrade from their base Inclusive Air option to the pricier Viking Air Plus fares in order to choose your specific flights.

Free airfare isn't free

Remember that free airfare perk? It's not actually free. The cruise lines increase the base cruise fare to cover the extra perks. Decline the airfare and they will reimburse you with an air credit or charge you a cruise-only rate. If you can find fares cheaper than the credit you'll save money by not booking your flights through your cruise line.

This advice especially applies to travelers flying from smaller airports that aren't among the major ones covered by the free airfare deal. Most cruise line airfare fine print states that passengers flying out of other airports will pay an additional fee. If you can book flights that are cheaper than the fee plus the air credit you should do that and skip the not-actually-free airfare.

The cruise lines can charge service fees for changes

Cruise lines can add their own fees and surcharges on top of the typical airline charges. Some lines such as Carnival charge a flat fee for flight changes in addition to the fees and fines imposed by airlines. If saving money is the most important consideration you might want to book independently to avoid any extra surcharges.

Affirming its confidence in the Jamaican tourism industry Sandals Resorts International is pumping US$240 million in investment during a pandemic that has forced the sector into a spirit of resilience.

The company’s executive chairman Adam Stewart while unveiling 84 new rooms and suites at Sandals Royal Caribbean in Montego Bay on Thursday morning spoke of the tremendous conviction the group has in Destination Jamaica.

The Jamaica-based resort company’s 2021-22 local projects include next summer’s construction of a brand new property to replace the demolished Jewel Runaway Bay the completion of phase one of Sandals Royal Dunn’s River in Ocho Rios and major expansion at Beaches Negril in Westmoreland.

“By virtue of our actions we are signalling that we believe and are committed to the country of Jamaica and tourism at large and we believe ultimately we will ‘get back to happy’ as we say it at Sandals” Stewart emphasised during a ribbon-cutting ceremony marking the first in a series of openings for the chain as it enters 2022.

Sandals Royal Caribbean is the second resort in the history of the organisation and the chain has improved and transformed the hotel in what it tags ‘Sandalization’ offering epicurean journeys at nine restaurants; the option of seven pools; a one-of-a-kind private offshore island and overwater bungalows which Stewart says have been the most aspirational and desirable hospitality accommodations anywhere in the Caribbean.

When combined with Sandals Montego Bay which is located five minutes away guests who stay at one and play at two have the option of 21 restaurants.

With 16 beachfront settings in Jamaica Antigua St Lucia The Bahamas Barbados Grenada and more recently Curaçao Stewart credits the chain’s success during a pandemic with their Sandals platinum protocol which he says is the most comprehensive protocol of any hospitality company this side of the hemisphere.

“It has kept us safe. We have worked hand in hand with the Government of Jamaica with the national protocols. I think Jamaica has done incredibly well” he said.

“Statistically if you look at the extremely low positivity rates Sandals’ positivity rate of 0.156 from the first of January 2021 to date it shows that the protocols work.”

Citing World Health Organization data about surface contagion levels of one in 10000 Stewart argued that the open-air layout of most Caribbean resorts lowered the risk of airborne spread.

Odyssey of the Seas was barred from entering Curacao and Aruba effectively remaining at sea until its planned return December 26 to Fort Lauderdale the Miami Herald reported.

Health officials in Curacao refused to allow the ship to dock because the percentage of infected people on board was too high the Curacao Chronicle reported.

There were 51 positive cases on board on Wednesday morning according to Dr Izzy Gerstenbluth Curacao's national epidemiologist.

""The day before yesterday 18 crew members were positive yesterday 36 and this morning there were 51. In addition several crew members have not been quarantined so there is a good chance that passengers have also been infected"" said Gerstenbluth.

""With these numbers of infections that percentage has been exceeded and we are therefore not eager to receive these people on the island especially not with the current figures on the island"" Gerstenbluth told the Chronicle .

According to Royal Caribbean Odyssey of the Seas can accommodate up to 5500 guests plus 1600 crew members. It wasn't clear if the ship was fully occupied on this trip.

The outbreak comes days after at least 48 people aboard Royal Caribbean's Symphony of the Seas tested positive for COVID-19 when the cruise docked in Miami the company said.

The Symphony of the Seas — known to be the world's biggest cruise ship — had more than 6000 passengers and crew on a week-long journey around the Caribbean. The number of people who tested positive accounted for 0.78 per cent of the on-board population.

It's unclear whether the highly infectious Omicron variant which is currently spreading rapidly around the world was responsible for the cases detected on either cruise.

Royal Caribbean rules dictate that all travellers on board a ship aged 12 and above must be fully vaccinated and test negative before departure. The cruise line says it ""strongly recommends"" guests receive a booster dose prior to sailing but this is not currently mandated."

Since being named on the ticket in late March she has limited her public exposure to friendly podcast interviews virtual events and social media posts.

Shanahan’s first in-person solo campaign stop is unlikely to persuade skeptics.

The event organized by Angela Stanton King a Kennedy campaign consultant who worked for Donald Trump’s campaign last cycle had minimal production and fanfare.

Unlike Kennedy’s campaign events this panel skipped the video trailer that usually proceeds Kennedy’s walk out on stage as well as the typical security presence from Gavin de Becker & Associates staff who flank Kennedy and screen attendees. After the event Shanahan did not stay for a selfie line instead she was whisked away by a white SUV.

“We are so honored to have our VP here in attendance and listening” said Angela Stanton King the event’s emcee and a consultant for the Kennedy campaign.

Stanton King billed the panel event which included a child support reform activist and her former co-star on a BET reality show as the first in a criminal justice reform-focused tour for the Kennedy campaign.

Shananhan’s remarks were light on policy but included admiration for Stanton King’s anti-abortion views.

Shanahan described an earlier private conversation during her remarks saying she saw a “gold light” in Stanton King’s eye while talking about “why you’re a pro-lifer.”

“And I realized there was nothing you could say that I would disagree with because it was coming from your protection for the mothers and children in your community” Shanahan said.

Stanton King runs a nonprofit in Georgia that supports women who chose not to get abortions and said she is advising the Kennedy campaign on abortion policy according to multiple posts on her social media account.

Both Shanahan and Kennedy have issued ambitious statements on abortion  with Kennedy expressing support at times for an abortion ban and for abortion to be legal until “full term.” The Kennedy campaign walked both statements back.

On criminal justice the subject of the event Shanahan mentioned donating money to the campaign of a progressive district attorney and learning about restorative justice.

“But then I realized it goes even deeper. I was learning how to heal myself. I was learning how to heal my daughter” she said. “I was understanding what human health and spirit needs and so I just realized what everybody needs is access to land access to clean food access to clean water access to opportunity.”

Criminal justice reform is part of the stated mission of Shanahan’s nonprofit Bia Echo. It has distributed $11.6 million in grants for this purpose according to financial disclosures filed to the IRS.

Volunteers also used the event to gather signatures to get Kennedy on the ballot in the Lone Star State before Monday’s ballot access deadline. The campaign needed to gather more than 100000 signatures from registered voters who did not participate in either a Democratic or Republican primary. The campaign is expected to turn in more than the required amount according to Richard Winger whose Ballot Access News site tracks third-party ballot access.

Kennedy is poised to put forth the strongest third-party challenge in decades thanks in part to his surname. Shanahan’s largest applause line didn’t come from her talking about her own perspective or background but instead when she mentioned Kennedy’s family legacy.

“Bobby Kennedy is finishing a story of what was robbed from his father and his uncle and that’s what this is all about’ she said to applause. “His father and uncle were murdered for taking a stand. They were both shot in the head. They were silenced.”

“It’s not going to be easy” she continued. “We’re up against so much shit right now.”

Kennedy Jr. said got into his head.

Sarah Sherman had the honors of dressing up as a worm and took a jab at Vanderpump Rules star Tom Sandoval who became known as “the worm with a mustache” after co-star James Kennedy yelled that out during the Season 10 reunion.

“RFK’s body was a worm’s paradise” Sherman said as the brain worm. “Not a single drop of vaccine in sight. My whole parasite posse hung out in there. Shoutout to hookworm… that fish that swims up your pee stream and my man Tom Sandoval.”

Sandoval remains in infamy after his cheating scandal exploded into the mainstream. The Bravo star had been in an almost decade-long relationship with co-star Ariana Madix and was exposed to be having an affair with another co-star Rachel Leviss in what became known as “Sandoval.”

In February SNL had already called out Sandoval on Weekend Update labeling him a “narcissist.”

Weekend Update co-host Colin Jost also cracked a joke at his own expense referring to the Staten Island ferry he and former SNL co-star Pete Davidson bought.

Jost informed viewers that this year marked the first time since 2009 that a Marvel Studios production had not kicked out the summer movie season.

“[It] better be a one time thing because a lot of people rely on Marvel movies to pay for the ferries they bought” Jost joked.

Jost is married to Scarlett Johansson who portrayed Black Widow across the MCU.

At Herold Flags in Rochester customers were snapping up Minnesota flags — plural.

""In all the years I've been in business I've never even come close to selling any flag more than the U.S. flag"" owner Lee Herold said. ""Now I've been selling more state flags than U.S. flags.""

The new state flag: bold blues and sharp angles. The old state flag: long ignored long derided suddenly in demand. And the North Star flag. The one Herold co-designed decades ago when he launched his long campaign for a flag all Minnesotans could get behind.

""Frankly I was astounded that people were still coming in to get it"" he said. The flag he designed to represent Minnesota is a golden star on a field of blue for Minnesota's lakes and rivers white for our winters green for our farms and forests.

There were probably more Minnesota homes flying North Star flags than the actual flag when the search for a replacement began last year. Some Minnesotans still make room for it in their hearts and on their flagpoles.

""I had someone come in this morning and they got both. They got the new [flag] design and the North Star"" said Herold who has also had several customers double up to purchase both the old state flag and the North Star.

When Minnesota launched its search for a new flag last year Herold submitted his North Star for consideration.

It wasn't the flag the committee chose. None of the thousands of flags Minnesotans designed quite match the version that now flies above the state.

But the flag competition brought out the best and weirdest in Minnesota. There were lady slippers and laser loons. There were flags that evoked Ojibwe beadwork or heirloom quilts. There were constellations of stars in a kaleidoscope of colors.

All of them represented Minnesota to somebody. That's a pretty great thing to represent.

Minnesota made its choice. And so did Minnesotans who have flocked to online and brick-and-mortar shops to buy whichever design says ""Minnesota"" to them.

Welcome to the second life of Minnesota's second-place flags.

A month before Statehood Day a new flag rose over the crowd at a Minnesota United game. A bright white flag with the image of a bag and the legend printed in letters big enough for the players to read and share the thrill of Minnesota pride: BAYG.

Bayg flag — beloved crowd-pleasing longshot in the state flag redesign contest — lives.

The State Emblems Redesign Commission for reasons that surpass all understanding declined to choose even one of the flag designs that feature loons shooting lasers out of their eyes. Yet laser loon lives — on flags on totes on stickers on any surface that could be improved by the addition of a laser loon.

Including your library card if you're lucky enough to live in St. Paul.

""One of the joys of my job is asking 'what if?'"" said Claire Huber marketing and communications specialist for the St. Paul Public Library. After watching social media collectively melt down with glee over the funniest state flag designs she wondered: ""What if we made a laser loon library card? Wouldn't it be funny if we did?""

After watching several ""how to draw a loon"" tutorials online Huber designed her own laser loon with the legend: ""READ.""

Suddenly a library card was the hottest ticket in town. The library gave away all 500 new cards — and 500 laser loon stickers for existing cardholders — in a matter of days and quickly printed a thousand more.

""One of the best things about this project has been to bring delight to people"" she said. ""To see something so silly but so community-driven. Everyone has an opinion about the flag … I think it taps into the innate pride of the North.""

Minnesota hasn't quite realized Herold's dream of one flag we can all rally behind.

""Reminder"" Gov. Tim Walz posted on social media on Friday. ""Minnesota's new official state flag will be raised for the first time tomorrow.""

He had reached the dying embers of Paris St.-Germain’s run in the Champions League. Yet again the dream of European glory that powered the club for more than a decade had been dashed.

Suddenly here he was clean through on goal: the best player in the world the hometown icon who has come to symbolize P.S.G.’s ambition prowess excess and hubris his flashbulb moment at his fingertips. And then as Dortmund’s defiant back line trailed helplessly in his blistering wake Mbappé slipped.

No tackle no foul no intervention whatsoever. He just fell over. He would not have his goal. He would not be the hero.

While participating in the on-field drills at the NFL Combine Oladapo suffered a broken toe. He had surgery on it a few weeks before the draft and the hope is that he will be good to go for training camp in August.

However in the meantime while Oladapo will still be involved in the team meetings he’s not going to have the opportunity to apply what he’s learning in the practice field.

An offer for Packers fans For the best local Wisconsin news sports entertainment and culture coverage subscribe to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. $1 for 6 months

“Just staying in the training room getting the swelling down getting my range of motion back” said Oladapo. “And then just staying locked in mental reps on the sideline and then meet with the coaches after make sure I get the game plan.”

Not that Oladapo will have the same fate as Grant DuBose – Oladapo’s path to contributing as a rookie is much more clear – but we saw just last offseason how an injury during this time of the year derailed any sort of roster push DuBose was hoping to make. He didn’t return to the practice field until mid-August and was playing catch up at that point.

At a minimum Oladapo figures to be a core special teams player for the Packers. Defensively while versatile like Javon Bullard and Evan Williams Oladapo fills more of the traditional safety role as GM Brian Gutekunst described it able to fill both the “free and strong safety role” who can also line up as the “big nickel Sam linebacker.”

“As we can move him around more” said defensive backs coach Ryan Downard “the walk throughs are going to become vital because these guys you teach them what you can but until you go out and do it and walk through it that’s to me where the real learning takes place.

“You can sit in a classroom and learn something but until you either have to teach it back or you take them out there physically let them walk through it that’s I think where the growth takes place.”

Downard added that Oladapo’s intelligence and football IQ will help him stay up to speed throughout this process. Downard liked what he saw from him during rookie minicamp and made sure to fire questions Oladapo’s way to keep him engaged.

The addition of Oladapo – along with Bullard and Williams – provides that interchangability that GM Brian Gutekunst was looking for at the position. Increased versatility at the position opens up the playbook for Jeff Hafley from a game-planning perspective and makes it more difficult for opposing offenses pre-snap not knowing who will have what responsibility.

Another element that these three players bring is speed and physicality. Along with finding the right players from a schematic standpoint there is a certain play-style that the Packers want to have under Hafley.

“I’m comfortable anywhere on the field” said Oladapo. “Whatever the team needs me to do: be in the box be in the post blitz guard tight ends guard slots. I can do it all. I feel comfortable just having my two feet on the grass.”"

A fitting description for Commvault. We’ve been following the company closely for several years and while seeing potential the company never reached its full potential. With last year’s introduction of Commvault Metallic the oil tanker started to turn. Today the course is truly different.

Commvault is old school. The company has been around since 1988 and has become one of the largest vendors in backups. By making sure your data is safely stored elsewhere if something should go wrong. Due to the large increase in cyber attacks this has become increasingly important over the past twenty years. Commvault has finally succeeded in leveraging the fact that they are old school.

Commvault has been broadly working on the same product for the past 20 years. Today this product is known as Commvault Complete. The software solution essentially allows any kind of backup or restore facilitating detailed configuration in every step of the backup process. Commvault’s customer base includes large enterprise organizations that backup and restore entire data centres and other complex infrastructures. Commvault even has customers who use the software to deploy completely new software-based infrastructures or standard VMs for customers.

With that said we’ve simultaneously stumbled upon the disadvantage of Commvault Complete. It is suitable for companies that want to configure every step and detail in the process. Companies with very specific requirements eager to be able to turn at all the knobs. In general these are very large enterprise organizations not SMBs. Meanwhile most companies are leaning more and more towards simplicity: solutions that work out-of-the-box requiring minimal effort. Commvault has been facing this situation for a long time seemingly unable to crack the puzzle. That is until the introduction of Metallic.

Metallic is the best of both worlds

Several competitors have passed Commvault in recent years. These competitors were able to offer simple solutions. In other words: reliables backup solutions with minimal configuration. Commvault tried to counter the latter with Complete but that product is simply not suitable for that purpose.

With Metallic Commvault gained an answer to its competition. Metallic is a new cloud-based product that can take all backups off your hands with a few simple actions. Metallic offers simplicity with a modern subscription model and no hidden costs. In addition Metallic supports both cloud and on-premises infrastructure as well as various SaaS applications such as Microsoft 365 and Salesforce.

As such Metallic is a truly modern offering. Meanwhile under the hood and out of sight of customers Metallic uses advanced Commvault technologies developed over the last 20 years. So while Metallic is a new proposition it leverages advanced technologies resulting from years of development. You don’t redevelop an algorithm to apply deduplication. Likewise Commvault doesn’t reinvent what it already has.

Commvault has a lot of advanced technology for backing up and restoring data. Developers can reuse many of these technologies. Naturally the tech has to be tweaked here and there but the algorithms remain the same. Because Metallic uses all of Commvault’s intellectual property it is a very mature and stable solution. This makes Metallic the best of both worlds for many companies: advanced backup technology with a simple interface.

Metallic is growing tremendously demand for support and features will increase

Metallic was introduced in Europe in October 2020. In the past year it has experienced tremendous growth. We discussed the subject with Bart Tournier (Sales Director Benelux) and Donny Navarrete (Metallic Cloud Sales Leader). They revealed that in the past year half of all Metallic customers were new to Commvault. The other half consists of existing customers. As far as they are concerned 50 percent in new business is unprecedented. It shows a great demand for simple yet comprehensive backup solutions.

Therefore Tournier states that he expects Commvault to be able to grow Metallic substantially in the coming year as well. The demand for Metallic is still increasing. Furthermore both men are positive about the further development of Metallic. Support for Microsoft Dynamics was recently added Microsoft’s ERP solution. Microsoft Dynamics is making great strides in the business world; Microsoft recently announced that sales of Dynamics have increased by 48 percent. Navarrete says that many customers sign up for backups of Microsoft 365 (Office Outlook OneDrive) and Salesforce. According to him many companies remain unaware of Microsoft 365’s limited retention time and the fact that you have to arrange your own backups for Microsoft 365.

Metallic has been available in the United States for about two years. In Europe for one year and since very recently in Asia and the Pacific as well. This allows Commvault to continue to grow globally giving greater priority to the further development of the product. Although Metallic can already make backups of for example AWS Azure and VMware infrastructure it still lacks support for Google Cloud Nutanix Oracle Cloud and IBM Cloud infrastructure. In time it will have to start supporting these platforms as well. Many companies have a multi-cloud strategy that goes beyond Azure and AWS.

Navarrete says this is true adding that he cannot say if and when certain extensions will be introduced. However he can confirm that Commvault has an agent that can be deployed to almost any infrastructure if necessary allowing universal backupping. Nevertheless Navarette admits that many companies would rather see it done without an agent. As such Commvault has a few more steps to take with Metallic in the coming years.

When touching upon the topic of Kubernetes it appears the company is further along. Backing up containers can be done through Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Services (EKS) RedHat OpenShift and VMware Tanzu. Also all CNCF-certified Kubernetes distributions should be supported. Google Anthos should among others be compatible.

Metallic works on-premises

Navarrete further emphasizes that even though Metallic is a cloud product there’s support for on-premises as well. Companies using Hyper-V or VMware in their own data centres can leverage Metallic. In addition companies can choose different storage locations for their backups. Commvault has its own Metallic Cloud Storage running on Azure which is an option as a backup location. It also offers Amazon S3 and Azure Storage. Moreover companies can choose to land backups in an on-premises environment. For example through Commvault Distributed Storage NetApp E-Series Dell EMC Isilon Pure Storage FlashArray HPE Primera Nimble or 3PAR and many others. This may be more convenient from a compliance or cost perspective.

Metallic becomes a white-label solution for MSPs

Due too the simplicity and high demand for Metallic many MSPs are interested in Metallic as well. Commvault provides MSPs with a special edition that allows the offering of Metallic as a white label solution. In other words: MSPs can now sell Metallic backup solutions under their own name. MSPs can also set their own prices and offer the environment in their own corporate identity.

The latter will undoubtedly lead to even greater adoption of Metallic. Tournier mentions that there are MSPs that save costs purely by using Metallic to backup data to the cloud. Metallic is as simple as it is competitively priced. Tournier says that Metallic is an excellent alternative for MSPs: if its cloud storage alone is cost-efficient imagine the savings possible when using Metallic to replace a proprietary backup platform.

Metallic Security IQ provides insight into user activity

Following up on the white label offering Commvault recently presented Metallic Security IQ. This is a complementary addition that gives companies complete visibility into activities within Metallic. To detect behavourial anomalies all user activity within Metallic is logged and made transparent. If users suddenly start deleting files en masse Security IQ can alert an administrator. The solution can also detect ransomware activity at an early stage. Ultimately Security IQ entails a security tool that’s all about keeping your backup data insightful and secure.

Commvault is once again sailing on a favourable course

To cite the oil tanker once more: Commvault is sailing a new course. A course more suited for today’s IT in which everything must be faster and simpler. The voyage of using existing advanced technology to create a new fast and simple but powerful product has been particularly successful. It remains to be seen whether Commvault can maintain this course and how competitors will respond.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL2Npby5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmluZGlhdGltZXMuY29tL25ld3Mvc3RyYXRlZ3ktYW5kLW1hbmFnZW1lbnQvaG93LXBhbmFzb25pYy1tYXN0ZXJlZC1zYWxlcy1ieS1sZXZlcmFnaW5nLXRlY2hub2xvZ3kvODg0NjYwNDbSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Panasonic mastered sales by leveraging technology,"By Dhrumil Dhakan



The field of sales has traditionally involved a lot of personal communication and relationship building but the advent of Work-from-Home has changed the way a typical sales staff functions. However this setback has forced organizations to have a new outlook towards the problem using technology to make sales.



Panasonic is one such company that in the last 18 months has utilized CRM software by partnering with Salesforce to keep in touch with customers.



“When it comes to sales specifically it’s very important that you stay connected with the customer physically because there are a lot of discussions if you have a product if you have a technology it becomes really arduous for any organization individual or salesperson to convince the customer that’s how it has been for so many years but with this pandemic everything came to a grinding halt we were also totally perturbed initially” Ajay Saraf Senior VP & Head Project Business at Panasonic Life Solutions said.

Through much internal discussions and the utilization of already existing software such as Zoom and MS Team Panasonic persisted and were able to crack accounts that they weren’t able to before he said.“With this pandemic it created a lot of opportunities for us in terms of reaching out to the customers the customers were also relatively free so we could engage with those customers through webinars MS Teams  and also we had one institutionalized CRM system which was there previously with us but the system was not behaving the way we wanted it to behave so we went in and had discussions with SFDC wherein we could institutionalize this CRM platform and that also helped us a lot” Saraf elaborated on their journey.The firm was able to leverage this system extensively in engaging with the customers and building the bridge between the internal and external customers. The firm focused on internalizing and building up this CRM platform in order to make it more robust.Talking about the major impact of the deployment on the organization he said “We could see that everybody’s talking the same language everybody is on the same platform even the customer is very keen to get associated with us through this platform we used to have demonstrations commercial activity all this happened through these platforms that we created and we focused majorly on this in fact the complete team was aligned and we also supported the customer in terms of which media to use how do you establish a virtual connect because they were also getting cornered in a sense because they also had to engage with their vendors or their customers.”Saraf emphasized the importance of proper implementation of such technologies as the access of it is so simple to large organizations. During the initial few months when things were still a little dormant Panasonic managed to integrate the CRM solutions into their system.“It took us 3-4 months to institutionalize which is in itself a record which is what I hear from the SFDC team and it was very very seamless and within 3 months time we were able to use it internally as well as externally be it in terms of leads or how do you prioritize your discussions how do you plan which customer is to be given priority. I think prioritization also helped through this platform” Saraf said on how institutionalizing the platform helped the firm.“Transactions started happening through this platform we were not used to it first of all and when we started accepting orders and discussing negotiations with the customer that was something which was very good for us. We could close some orders and with this ERP in place it could automatically capture and consolidate data for us as I mentioned in terms of orders billings shipments” Saraf added.He further explained that the platform allowed the organization to provide the customer with demos and pitches and most importantly helped them secure orders.“I would say for any organization a robust CRM platform is something which is very important so there are a lot of other technological innovations also incorporations which we did but if we talk about the last 8-10 months this implementation was something which was a runaway success for us and this was the kind of transformation project for us and we are reaping the harvest now” Saraf concluded.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMS8xMi8yNS9pbnZlc3RpbmcvY2VvLW9mLXRoZS15ZWFyLTIwMjEvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBQWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uLzIwMjEvMTIvMjUvaW52ZXN0aW5nL2Nlby1vZi10aGUteWVhci0yMDIx?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Albert Bourla of Pfizer is the CNN Business CEO of the Year,"New York CNN Business —

The Covid-19 pandemic is far from over. But life in many ways has returned to something resembling normal for many. That’s in large part because there are now multiple coronavirus vaccines including one from Pfizer.

And that’s one of the main reasons CNN Business has named Pfizer (PFE) CEO Albert Bourla as the CEO of the year. Bourla joins previous winners Marc Benioff of Salesforce (CRM) Target (TGT) CEO Brian Cornell and Chipotle’s (CMG) Brian Niccol.

CNN Business considered several other influential CEOs for this year’s honor including Lisa Su of AMD (AMD) Ford’s (F) Jim Farley Marvin Ellison of Lowe’s (LOW) David Solomon of Goldman Sachs (GS) Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Sundar Pichai and yes Time Person of the Year Elon Musk of Tesla (TSLA)/SpaceX.

But Bourla was our choice for all that Pfizer has done in a year where Covid vaccines went mainstream (vaccine was even named word of the year by Merriam-Webster) and helped stabilize America’s economy — and the world’s for that matter.

“Pfizer did a lot of good [for] humanity and we are very very proud of it” Bourla said in an interview with CNN Business. “Not only were we able to save so many lives … but we are enjoying high levels of corporate reputation right now. People like us.”

Hoping to get Covid pill approved in early 2022

Pfizer isn’t the only company that has developed a vaccine. But the Big Pharma leader even more so than its European partner BioNTech (BNTX) or rival vaccine developer Moderna (MRNA) has become synonymous with the fight against Covid.

The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was the first approved in the United States for 5- to 11-year old kids. But many parents of even younger children are now waiting to hear about when a vaccine might be approved for babies toddlers and pre-schoolers.

Bourla said he understands the frustration of parents who are fully vaccinated but cannot get their youngest kids protected.

“We’re working very intensively on that to make sure we can bring a solution for that” Bourla said.

“We are looking at different doses well below the doses that have been used [for adults and older kids.] We know that it will be safe. What we are looking to see is if that will protect them by giving the lower dose” he added.

But Pfizer announced after the interview with CNN Business took place that it is still evaluating whether three smaller doses of its vaccine will be effective for kids under 5 after finding two child-sized doses were not producing the expected immunity in 2- to 5-year-olds.

In addition Pfizer has developed a pill that could drastically reduce the risk of severe complications hospitalization and death for people who contract the virus. The Food and Drug Administration announced following the interview with Bourla that it had approved Pfizer’s Paxlovid oral treatment.

But Bourla stressed to CNN Business that the pill is not meant to be a substitute for the vaccine.

Ready to launch an Omicron-specific vaccine if needed

The recent rise of the Omicron variant has created concerns around the globe about the efficacy of the current vaccines. But Bourla told CNN Business that he believes its and BioNTech’s vaccine will control Omicron “quite well” especially if people have received two doses and the booster.

He conceded however that it is possible Pfizer will need to launch a new vaccine to specifically target Omicron or any other future variants. Bourla said Pfizer is already developing a shot aimed at Omicron and that he believes it could be tested and submitted to regulators for approval by March.

If Pfizer needs to produce Omicron-specific shots that will not slow the manufacturing of the existing vaccine Bourla said.

“We are aiming for a four billion [dose] annual manufacturing capacity of our current vaccine. And if we have to switch between the two the old and the new we still will make four billion. We don’t expect that we will lose any volume” he said.

Bourla also acknowledged that there are cynics who question whether Pfizer is just trying to make as much money as possible from the vaccine.

After all Pfizer said in its latest earnings release in November that it generated $13 billion in revenue from the vaccine in the third quarter and that it now expects $36 billion in revenue from it for the full year.

Bourla told CNN Business that it is charging poorer developing nations less for the vaccine than it does to wealthier countries. But cost isn’t the only challenge. He said some countries such as those in remote parts of Africa are “lacking basic infrastructure.”

“They don’t have centers to vaccinate people particularly in remote places. They do not have enough nurses” he said. “Sometimes they are lacking syringes sometimes they are lacking refrigerators so that they can store the vaccine. So this is unfortunately the situation.”

Bourla is hopeful the World Health Organization and the public-private vaccine alliance Gavi will be able to help resolve some of these issues. He also said the company is looking into drone delivery more to ensure that people get the vaccine more quickly.

“We are doing everything we can to find ourselves on the right [side] of history” he said.

Bourla also continued to stress that the vaccine is safe and that the only way for life to return to normal is for people to get the shots.

“I don’t see any reason why next year will not be a normal year if we do the simple things that are available for us” Bourla said. “If we have very big numbers of people that don’t want to do a third dose or don’t want to vaccinate at all that’s a problem.”

More to Pfizer than the Covid vaccine

Pfizer and Bourla aren’t resting on their laurels.

The company has also been at the forefront of developing many other promising blockbuster drugs such as blood thinner Eliquis breast cancer treatment Ibrance and rheumatoid arthritis pill Xeljanz as well as the Prevnar family of pneumonia vaccines.

Bourla is fully aware that for a drug company to remain successful it has to have even more promising drugs in the pipeline.

Several of Pfizer’s current top sellers are due to lose patent protection in the next few years. Once they expire that opens the door for cheaper generic drugs to compete with them.

That’s a big reason why Pfizer announced plans for a nearly $7 billion deal earlier in December to acquire Arena Pharmaceuticals (ARNA) a company developing drugs to treat immuno-inflammatory diseases. The acquisition came just one month after Pfizer completed a more than $2 billion purchase of cancer drug maker Trillium Therapeutics.

“It’s challenging to multitask” Bourla said. “But let’s not forget what else we are working on. There are so many medicines for cancer for other infectious diseases for cardiovascular diseases for other diseases.”

“We are heavily invested right now in cancer” Bourla added. “The biggest percentage of our R&D investment goes into oncology right now.”

Investors have rewarded Pfizer which ironically enough was booted from the venerable Dow Jones Industrial Average in 2020 just a few months before its vaccine was approved. Shares are up nearly 65% in 2021 — more than any Dow stock — and are not far from a record high.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiJGh0dHBzOi8vaGFici5jb20vZW4vYXJ0aWNsZXMvNTk3ODczL9IBLGh0dHBzOi8vaGFici5jb20vZW4vYW1wL3B1YmxpY2F0aW9ucy81OTc4NzMv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Christmas is here and there is GNOME Desktop Environment extension to improve festive mood,"🎄 It's not snowing in my region but I really like ""true"" winter holidays ambience and I'd like it to snow at least on my laptop. When I found there were no good existing solutions I made my own one using GJS and GNOME Extensions.

Not familiar with Linux and/or GNOME? Check out GNOME Project and Fedora OS websites.

Snowy is fun extension that:

Provides falling snowflakes on screen to improve your festive mood ☃️

Lightweight: There are no any ""heavy"" animations and styles so resource consumption is as minimal. You can also set limit of total snowflakes number on screen to prevent system lagging. Extension is written according to GNOME Extensions guidelines so it has all the known CPU/RAM consumption fixes.

Well documented: The extension has well-designed homepage with installation building and configuration instructions.

Well configurable: There are settings for snowflakes icons (any characters supported by your system) size rotation angle falling duration (speed) and falling interval (rate) other settings are under development.

Has nice support: In addition to lightness what means non-powerful PC support Snowy works great with any (both vertical and horizontal) multi-monitor setup. New versions with bug fixes and support for new GNOME versions are released as soon as possible.

Here are extension's GitHub repository and homepage on GNOME Extensions.

P.S. There are many hidden apps on preview below so it's not only Snowy consumes all that resources shown at the system monitor.",,,

Text description provided by the architects. Selah House a small (2247 SF) home for a soon-to-be-retired doctor is designed with mature environmental strategies that in its next life will become part of a nature preserve. Great care was taken to locate the house in an existing clearing with a “light touch” removing very few trees. Designed for a 100-year life all decisions regarding design material and systems were optimized for an environmentally engaged home.

The program is simple - living kitchen bedroom bath with two special spaces a private garden and a writer’s loft. The house is designed for inhabitants to be intimately connected to the cycles of the day weather seasons and abundant local flora and fauna. Standing in the center of the warm maple paneled interior you are only eight feet away from the courtyard to the north and the view through the trees and across the valley to the south. When the sliding glass doors are open in the main bedroom the room becomes a sleeping screen porch in the forest. From the writer’s tower it seems as if you can touch the moon and stars brilliant in the black sky.

In designing the Selah House the architects set the project in-between witness and the environment: the house is both the frame and foil for the interaction. The design is responsive in this relationship between a visitor and the full environment of the site. The siting form location of rooms views movement of the sun through seasons the weather and the wildlife are in a dynamic conversation to elevate awareness surprise and insight. Selah is designed with mature environmental strategies that will become part of a nature preserve in its next life. Great care was taken to locate the house in an existing clearing with a “light touch” removing very few trees. Designed for long 100-year life all decisions regarding design material and systems were optimized for an environmentally engaged home.

The house is durably built with regional natural materials. Material choices were all judged by their life cycle value to support the most durable and sustainable structure. The house is constructed with super-insulated walls and a high-performance air and vapor barrier skinned with long-lasting slate shingles. The windows are thermally broken double-glazed portals that connect the interior with the exterior and harvest natural light. The southern overhang protects the interior from the summer sun but invites its warmth in the winter.

The house has a dual fuel high efficiency split HVAC system a solar water heat system with an instant backup net-metered photovoltaic electric panels and an electric car charger in the garage. The owner’s energy bills have ranged from $0-$12 per month. The owner currently splits his time between New York with his patients and the house on weekends.

Some of us slowly returned to an office which we inhabited only part-time. New commutes began from pandemic-acquired country homes or suburban houses. We tested the waters of in-person hangouts parties and vacations. Ultimately we still spent a lot of time at home. So what will 2022 bring? It’s hard to say. But to get those dream lists and projects ideating we tapped 16 experts—from an array of interiors backgrounds—to tell us their home renovation predictions for the new year. Let’s keep on renovating in 2022!

Investments in the home office

“There will be an increase in home offices—homeowners are trading kitchen counters for more professional dedicated spaces. The Zoom fatigue is real but so is the realization that the backdrop for those visual calls needs to step up. Allocating space for a home office often involves a reset of the room’s function. For example sitting rooms off of bedrooms or smaller family rooms are converted. Guest rooms also do double duty with sleepers and desks.” —Jean Brownhill founder of Sweeten

“We are all becoming more aware of how the layout and aesthetics of a room can affect our energy and productivity. Transforming a current room into your new home office space is not just a fun project but a necessity for many people who work remotely. When trying to boost the functionality of a home this room may be at the forefront. People will spend more time and effort in designing a unique working space to maximize their concentration motivation and productivity this year.” —Farris Wu founder and CEO at DecorMatters

“Remember the days of home offices and dining rooms being the first rooms you see when entering a home? Well those days are back and we’re getting excited about the requests we’re getting from clients focused on creating the perfect home office space. Once unused rooms such as secondary living spaces and breakfast rooms are now being transformed into custom office spaces with built-ins and high-tech solutions such as smart boards projectors and wet bars.” —Devin Shaffer lead interior designer at Decorilla Online Interior Design",,,,,,

Earlier this month PEOPLE caught up with Legend ahead of his performance at Nordstrom's A Legendary Holiday event at Nordstrom's flagship store in New York City where the EGOT-winner discussed his family's love for the holidays.

The dad of two explained that now that Luna is ""old enough to really know what's going on"" and Miles is ""just figuring things out"" that their family is just starting to create their own Christmas traditions.

As for what the kiddos are getting for Christmas this year? ""Miles tells us he wants an airplane"" he noted while Luna asked for ""a unicorn.""

""Christmas is all about the kids"" Legend said telling PEOPLE that he and Teigen don't exchange big gifts.

Only one Ramsay child was missing from TV chef Gordon Ramsay's cosy Christmas Eve snap - with even one of his rarely-pictured daughters posing alongside Strictly Come Dancing star Tilly Ramsay

Gordon Ramsay and his family have been getting cosy on Christmas Eve.

The TV chef 55 took to social media on Friday to share a wholesome snap of the Ramsay family all donning matching festive onesies.

In the adorable snap Gordon and wife Tana Ramsay can be seen beaming alongside Strictly Come Dancing star Tilly Ramsay and three more of their five children.

21-year-old daughter Holly - who recently celebrated one year sober - beamed as she posed alongside her Strictly sibling and rarely-seen sister Megan.

Holly's twin brother Jack who joined the Royal Marines last year was the only Ramsay offspring missing from the cosy Christmas Eve picture - with youngest Oscar sat on mum Tana's knee.

While the Ramsay ladies wore red all-in-one suits the Kitchen Nightmares star matched with his toddler son Oscar in an alternative black version.

""Merry Christmas from all the Ramsay’s enjoy this special time lots of love Gordon"" the culinary star captioned the sweet snap to his 13.2 million Instagram followers on Christmas Eve.

Strictly Come Dancing champion Giovanni Pernice was one of the many famous faces to comment under the post writing: ""Merry Xmas you beutiful [sic] family.""

A few questioned where Jack 21 was when the cosy snap was taken.

""Apparently he's in the royal marines"" one follower suggested when someone enquired where the star's eldest son was.

""or taking the photo"" another suggested.

When Jack joined the Royal Marines in 2020 proud dad Gordon praised his son for signing up to the United Kingdom's Navy.

""Jack Ramsay you’ve made me feel like the proudest father today"" he wrote on Instagram at the time adding that it was an ""amazing achievement.""

In one of the snaps shared the super proud dad can be seen beaming alongside his son - posing in his new uniform - and his youngest son Oscar.

After welcoming Oscar into the world in 2019 Gordon opened up to The Mirror about becoming a father again in his fifties.

""I am convinced I am going to spend more time with Oscar"" he told us two years ago.

""I am excited to be more hands-on.

The celebrity chef also reflected on his own childhood and his relationship with his own father.

""I had a very humble upbringing—loved by my mother and I think loved by my father but I was desperate to get out the sh**hole I was in"" he explained.

""I didn't want to turn out like my dad. I didn't want to live in a council house and put my kids to school with second-hand clothes. You strive to better yourself.""

CONOR McGREGOR shared photos of his newborn son Rian enjoying his first Christmas on Instagram.

The UFC star welcomed the birth of his third child with fiancee Dee Devlin earlier this year.

The former two weight world champion already has a son named Conor Jr and a daughter named Croia.

And he snapped the newest addition to the McGregor clan enjoying himself in a toy car beside a statue of Santa.

In the caption McGregor wrote: ""Rían’s 1st Christmas we are buzzing!

Happy Christmas everyone.""

McGregor is currently out of action as he recovers from the broken leg he suffered in his last fight against Dustin Poirier earlier this year.

He enjoyed a Christmas night out with Devlin and family members in his Black Forge Inn pub in Drimnagh.

And UFC President Dana White believes he will be ready to return to action in the Octagon again next summer.

He said: “The guy’s go plenty of money but he is still super passionate about fighting.

""Fired up to come back and he’s out there doing everything he needs to do to get himself ready to perform again. He’s chomping a the bit to get back.

“If everything goes right with the healing of his leg he should fight this summer.""

McGregor has been calling for a third fight with his old rival Nate Diaz when he is fit again to return to MMA action.

The two fighters went toe to toe in two epic contests back in 2016 with each fighter taking one victory.

White has said he's open to making the long awaited trilogy fight between the pair provided Diaz also wants it.

McGregor's coach John Kavanagh also said he'd like to see the fight as he believes McGregor and Diaz are perfect rivals for each other.

He said: ""Look the Nate trilogy is like Batman vs Joker they're going to face each other forever.

""They're just perfectly made opponents it's great fun the build-up and there's a respect I won't say it's begrudging.

""They snipe at each other but there's a bit of a tip of the hat to each other as well because they're both warriors and great fighters. It would be lovely to see."""

SEEM builds on existing bilateral trading by establishing a new platform matching buyers and sellers of excess electricity. A third-party analysis estimated SEEM would save 50 million consumers more than $100 million annually by 2037 while boosting renewable energy and energy storage.

Fourteen utilities including Southern Company two Duke energy subsidiaries and the Tennessee Valley Authority submitted the proposal which became automatically effective Oct. 12 due to a 2-2 deadlock at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. On Dec. 13 FERC denied two rehearing requests from opponents of the proposal because they missed a Nov. 10 deadline.

Southern Company spokesman Todd Terrell said ""we are working to be ready in the second half of 2022"" for the SEEM initiative to go live.

Tyler Jubert a power market analyst at S&P Global Platts Analytics said the original proposal in February said the new market ""would reduce trade friction and promote the integration of renewables.""

""However the agreement still lacks an official plan on how an automated system matching buyers and sellers would operate; therefore it remains unclear how trade will be impacted as well as what the integration of renewables will look like"" Jubert said. ""Critics of the agreement have also pointed out a number of potential flaws such as a potential ... for SEEM participants to feel incentivized to maintain their monopoly power at the expense of the customer... and it remains unclear if any additional changes will be implemented at this point making it difficult to say how prices or new projects will be impacted.""

Eric Smith Tulane Energy Institute associate director said the project ""won't really be resolved"" until FERC's newest commissioner Willie Phillips has his say about it.

""When he does the decision will be whatever the leaders of the Democratic party and the Washington circuit [court] decide not the existing members of FERC and certainly not the ... members of the proposed quasi-market"" Smith said.

Smith said he thinks SEEM ""is merely an attempt to maintain the status quo by creating a rudimentary market with limited access and two classes of membership.""

""While [FERC Chairman Richard] Glick is correct in that it is a step forward it is not a very big step"" Smith said.

Forward price trends

Regardless of when and how SEEM is implemented forward traders appear to foresee weakening prices in the second half of 2022. As of Dec. 15 Into Southern and Florida on-peak power forwards for August through December 2022 were substantially lower than average monthly day-ahead on-peak indexes for the comparable months of 2021. For almost all previous months 2022 forwards were valued as higher than 2021's comparable monthly average dailies.

Natural gas forwards and spot indexes followed a similar pattern with most forwards for the second half of 2022 substantially lower than comparable spot numbers in 2021 but with most forwards substantially higher than comparable spot numbers in in the first half of the 2021.

Increased power supply in the region may play a role in lower power price expectations for 2022's second half.

Georgia Power's latest update on its two new Vogtle nuclear generators each with 1117 MW capacity indicates that Vogtle Unit 3 should go online in the third quarter of 2022 followed by Unit 4 in Q2 2023.

However Georgia Public Service Commission staff and independent construction monitors filed on Dec. 1 an estimate that Unit 3 will likely go online between December 2022 and February 2023.

Solar growth coal retirements

Solar is also slated to grow substantially in 2022 but that growth faces uncertainty around supply chain issues. S&P Global Market Intelligence data shows 3.3 GW of solar capacity under construction with 2022 commercial operation dates which would top the 2.7 GW added in 2021 and add to the 19.8 GW installed as of the end of 2020.

The largest solar capacity added in 2021 was 1104 MW in Florida but Georgia has 1146 MW under construction with 2022 planned in-service dates.

However supply constraints exacerbated by the recently dismissed petitions for relief from anti-dumping and countervailing duties on solar cells from Malaysia Thailand and Vietnam ""caused significant shipping disruptions for importers"" the Solar Energy Industry Association said Dec. 14.

Jamie Bach Tennessee Valley Authority Commercial Energy Solution manager said ""Next year we can expect headwinds in terms of commodity and supply chain pressures but remain committed to solar growth to meet increased customer demand.""

Coal retirements may constrain Southeastern US power supply in 2022 which might strengthen power prices. Platts Analytics data shows 3.6 GW of coal retirements across the region in 2022 focused on Georgia Tennessee Florida and Kentucky.

Platts Analytics' Jubert said nuclear and solar additions would more than offset ""coal retirements we anticipate through 2022 so the incremental access to supply would offer lower wholesale power prices as demand is expected to hold flat.""

""This is assuming the Vogtle plant is completed next year"" Jubert said. ""We typically go with what the company's latest proposed in-service date is. However if they are once again reporting further construction delays then that certainly puts a risk to the 3Q 2022 timeline.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGlsbC5jb20vY2hhbmdpbmctYW1lcmljYS9zdXN0YWluYWJpbGl0eS9lbnZpcm9ubWVudC81ODcxNTItbHVtYmVyLWNvbXBhbnktcmV0dXJucy13YXRlcmZyb250LXByb3BlcnR5LXRvL9IBeWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGlsbC5jb20vY2hhbmdpbmctYW1lcmljYS9zdXN0YWluYWJpbGl0eS9lbnZpcm9ubWVudC81ODcxNTItbHVtYmVyLWNvbXBhbnktcmV0dXJucy13YXRlcmZyb250LXByb3BlcnR5LXRvL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lumber company returns waterfront property to Native American tribe in Washington state at no cost,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://thehill.com/changing-america/sustainability/environment/587152-lumber-company-returns-waterfront-property-to/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGlsbC5jb20vY2hhbmdpbmctYW1lcmljYS9zdXN0YWluYWJpbGl0eS9lbnZpcm9ubWVudC81ODcxNTItbHVtYmVyLWNvbXBhbnktcmV0dXJucy13YXRlcmZyb250LXByb3BlcnR5LXRvL9IBeWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGlsbC5jb20vY2hhbmdpbmctYW1lcmljYS9zdXN0YWluYWJpbGl0eS9lbnZpcm9ubWVudC81ODcxNTItbHVtYmVyLWNvbXBhbnktcmV0dXJucy13YXRlcmZyb250LXByb3BlcnR5LXRvL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pY2lqLm9yZy9pbnZlc3RpZ2F0aW9ucy9wYW5kb3JhLXBhcGVycy9wcm9wb3NlZC1ldS1kaXJlY3RpdmUtdGFyZ2V0cy1zaGVsbC1jb21wYW5pZXMtYWZ0ZXItcGFuZG9yYS1wYXBlcnMtZXhwb3NlZC1vZmZzaG9yZS1zeXN0ZW0tYWJ1c2VzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Proposed EU directive targets shell companies after Pandora Papers exposed offshore system abuses - ICIJ,"The European Commission proposed a new directive this week to target shell companies less than three months after the Pandora Papers investigation by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists exposed the large-scale use of anonymous vehicles to hide money avoid taxes and disguise asset ownership.

The proposal dubbed “Unshell” would seek to ensure that letter-box companies that have “no or minimal economic activity” in the EU cannot benefit from any tax advantages the text of the proposal says.

“Recent investigations such as OpenLux or the Pandora papers were another reminder of the injustices that characterize our economic system today” economy commissioner Paolo Gentiloni said at a press conference on Wednesday.

OpenLux by Le Monde and other news organizations showed how Luxembourg’s investment fund industry helps people launder money and avoid tax.

Pandora Papers an ICIJ investigation in collaboration with 600 reporters worldwide is based on a leak of 11.9 million financial records from 14 offshore financial service providers. The data unveiled details on shell companies and trusts owned by 29000 people from around the world including country leaders powerful business people criminals and celebrities.

Those people used shell companies registered in secrecy jurisdictions including the British Virgin Islands the United Arab Emirates and the Cook Islands to own real estate precious artworks and antiquities and investment portfolios the documents show.

Among shell company owners in Pandora Papers ICIJ and its partners identified prominent European politicians including Czech Republic’s former Prime Minister Andrej Babis who used a web of shell companies to own luxury estate in Southern France and Dutch Finance Minister Wopke Hoekstra who invested in a shell company with interests in a safari enterprise in Kenya. They both denied wrongdoing.

According to a 2018 study commissioned by the European Parliament’s financial crimes committee a “‘shell’ company provides anonymity as a key element while simultaneously guaranteeing control over the shell company and its resources.”

The use of shell companies can be legal the study adds but “when associated with anonymity … they can be misused and thus entail serious risks of tax avoidance tax evasion money laundering and abuse of social rights.”

‘Unshell’ proposal

Three criteria will determine whether an entity exists only on paper and consequently is deemed unable to obtain tax relief and tax benefits according to the new directive proposed by the commission.

The criteria are: the nature of the company’s income the proportion of cross-border transactions for the company’s business and whether the company’s management is outsourced or performed in-house.

The proposal “will enable us to step up the fight against tax avoidance and evasion by tightening the screws on shell companies – or letterbox companies – used as vehicles for tax avoidance or evasion” Gentiloni said.

“The new rules will establish transparency standards around the use of shell entities so that their abuse can more easily be detected by tax authorities” he said.

If the entity is a shell company it will have to comply with new tax reporting obligations and “inbound payments will be taxed in the state of the shell’s shareholder” according to the proposal. If the company’s purpose is to own luxury real estate the asset will be taxed by the state where the property is located “as if it were owned by the individual directly” the document says.

The new directive will also increase exchange information across the bloc and enable member states to request another member to conduct a tax audit of any shell company.

In addition to the initiative on shell companies the commission’s proposal also included the implementation of a minimum tax of 15% for large corporations that have their parent or a subsidiary in the EU.

The minimum tax requirement follows a “historic deal” agreed upon by 136 countries and brokered by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development last October and is aimed at stopping the global race to the bottom in terms of corporate tax rates.

The EU Tax observatory a research think tank led by economist Gabriel Zucman estimated that such reform in the EU would increase the corporate income tax revenue by more than $90 billion a year.

Once adopted by EU Member states the proposed directive will come into effect in January 2024.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vaS1yZW50LW91dC1saXZpbmctY2hyaXN0bWFzLXRyZWVzLWJ1c3ktZnVsZmlsbGluZy13b3JrLTIwMjEtMTLSAWJodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuY29tL2ktcmVudC1vdXQtbGl2aW5nLWNocmlzdG1hcy10cmVlcy1idXN5LWZ1bGZpbGxpbmctd29yay0yMDIxLTEyP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,I rent out living Christmas trees to replant after the holidays,"Founder Scott Martin and his dog Kota Claus. The Living Christmas Company

Scott Martin is a landscape architect and the founder of The Living Christmas Company.

Martin and his team rent out living Christmas trees as an alternative to cut or artificial trees.

This is what his job is like as told to writer Jenny Powers.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Scott Martin a landscape architect and the founder of The Living Christmas Company. It has been edited for length and clarity.

When I was a teenager a close friend and I took a job delivering Christmas trees during the holidays in California where we lived. We earned good money and made plenty of tips and everyone was always happy to see us when we arrived tree in hand.

It was such a rush to pass by the houses we'd delivered to and spot the trees in the windows decorated so festively

But then shortly after Christmas we'd pass by those same homes only to find the trees laying outside on the curb stripped bare of all their decor and tossed out next to the trash to be picked up and thrown away.

It struck me as such a disconnect between the happiness on the front end of the tree experience and the disappointment on the back end of witnessing the very same trees that had brought joy to their owners now being discarded.

I remember wondering why people didn't put living trees in their homes instead of dead ones that they'd only throw out after the holidays and the idea just stuck with me. Over time I found out there were people who actually grew trees for this very purpose.

So in 2008 I took some of my savings and invested it in living trees renting them out as potted Christmas trees which made them reusable and plantable when they outgrew their pot

Martin's 2012 ""Shark Tank"" appearance with Mark Cuban on the cover of TV Guide. The Living Christmas Company

That first season I did a soft launch by renting out and delivering 100 Christmas trees locally in California. The following year word of mouth spread and I put up a website. By the next season I'd hired a marketing agency and things just blew up from there.

In 2012 I appeared on ""Shark Tank"" and walked out with a $150000 investment from Mark Cuban in exchange for 40% equity in the company. To this day we're still partners.

We start delivering trees on the weekend after Thanksgiving. In the off season for the past 10 years I've worked as a professional mediator and conflict coach for the nonprofit Mediators Beyond Borders International.



We rent out Christmas trees within 7 delivery zones in Southern California and offer 3 different types that range in price from $135 to $295

Monterey pine is our most popular tree because of its dark-green soft needles that smell like Christmas. Aleppo pine is the easiest to care for and has the highest success rate of survival when planted after retirement. And blue spruce is closest to a traditional noble fir Christmas tree and has open rigid branches that make it the easiest to decorate though it's not very fragrant.

Our trees weigh between 150 and 250 pounds and come with a pot that sits atop a tray. The trees need to be watered every two to three days. We joke that if a tree is returned to us dead or dying your penalty is that we put you on the naughty list.

Something that surprises a lot of people is that a tree can actually go into shock and die when its location is changed

JB an employee of The Living Christmas Company out delivering trees. The Living Christmas Company

After all it's a living thing. We provide care instructions and encourage people to name their trees and water them regularly.

Los Angeles tends to have a pretty transient population and since a lot of people aren't actually from here and tend to go home for the holidays they don't typically get trees. But since the pandemic more and more people are staying home and getting trees.







This season we rented out 1000 trees

The company starts delivering trees the weekend after Thanksgiving. The Living Christmas Company

Some trees come back to us and can be kept a second year in the same pot while the larger ones need to be repotted.

Any trees that return to us a little funky get donated to what I like to refer to as the ""island of misfit trees"" and are planted in the ground right away. Every season we post our misfits on Craigslist and people can claim them as their own after the holidays. While they may not make good standalone trees they're great in groupings for wind or erosion control.



Our customers are all ecologically-minded individuals that run the gamut from first-timers to diehards who've been renting from us for 10 to 12 years and raise their children only knowing live Christmas trees.

We have a delivery crew of 20 to 30 people along with four 'elves' who handle customer service

Each year we partner with a local nonprofit and hire some of their members to work for us as well. By doing this we've been able to employ veterans the formerly incarcerated and the homeless.

This holiday season we've teamed up with the Adult Transition Program which is part of the Long Beach Unified School District to offer special-needs individuals between the ages of 18 and 24 who have aged out of foster care transitional work opportunities with us.

As for me my Christmas tree is a 3-foot-tall funky bonsai I've had for years

Some years I get a chance to string lights on it and dress it up. Other years I'm too busy with work to do it.

Whether or not my tree gets decorated is a strong indicator of how busy we are at the nursery. This year my tree was still bare four days before Christmas if that tells you anything.",,,

FlightAware a flight-tracking website noted 888 flights entering leaving or inside the U.S. canceled Saturday up from 690 Friday. About 200 more flights were already canceled for Sunday

Delta United and JetBlue on Friday had all said the omicron variant was causing staffing problems leading to flight cancellations. United spokesperson Maddie King said staffing shortages were still causing cancellations and it was unclear when normal operations would return.

“This was unexpected” King said of omicron’s impact on staffing.

According to FlightAware the three airlines canceled more than 10% of their Saturday scheduled flights. American Airlines also canceled 90 flights Saturday about 3% of its schedule according to FlightAware. American spokesperson Derek Walls said the cancellations stemmed from “COVID-related sick calls” and the airline contacted customers on Friday. European and Australian airlines have also canceled holiday-season flights due to staffing problems tied to COVID.

Flight delays and cancellations tied to staffing shortages have been a regular problem for the U.S. airline industry this year. Airlines encouraged workers to quit in 2020 when air travel collapsed and were caught short-staffed this year as travel recovered.

It's due to a rise in cases of the Omicron variant of Covid-19 causing hundreds of flights to be canceled and forcing airlines and passengers to stay put.

United Airlines has canceled more than 100 flights that were originally set to depart today. The airline says a surge of Covid-19 cases has impacted its workforce. Delta Airlines meanwhile have cited potentially bad weather as well as the Omicron variant before canceling 90 flights.

Alaska Airlines has canceled more than a dozen flights after some employees reported a possible exposure to Covid-19. Each airline said they were trying to reschedule as many passengers as possible.

This comes as travelers are rushing to get home for the holidays. Holiday air travelers are heading out to their holiday locations spending time with family friends and loved ones.

AAA estimates 109 million people will be traveling for the holidays.

At Southwest Florida International Airport there are currently eleven flights that have been canceled.

Here's how to get a refund.,"This story has been updated. While the airline industry has worked out a lot of its issues caused by the pandemic it’s still not always smooth sailing for air travelers. According to the Department of Transportation flight cancellations stayed below 2 percent during the first four months of 2023 lower than the 2.7 percent cancellation rate of 2022.

Most recently United Airlines canceled hundreds of flights ahead of the July 4 holiday due to weather and equipment issues affecting about 150000 travelers.

If you’re an unlucky flyer who ends up stuck this summer we compiled a guide for what to do if your flight gets canceled and how to get a refund you are owed.

If your flight gets canceled

The bad news is your flight has been canceled. The good news is the airline owes you a refund; Department of Transportation regulations entitle you to one regardless of the reason your flight was canceled. DOT released an online dashboard last year to show travelers a quick view of what airlines offer for passengers affected by cancellations and delays.

But be warned: Accepting the canceled flight getting your money back and starting from scratch may put you in a position of scrambling for a more expensive flight if you can find one at all. Then there’s the risk that your new flight may be canceled or delayed. You may want to reschedule your flight with the airline instead of going for the refund.

More bad news if a flight is canceled: It may take a long time to get rescheduled especially during peak travel periods when flights are already packed. Some small airlines don’t have multiple flights a day or might only fly a few days a week.

“When they cancel one of those remaining flights the number of empty seats on what remains in their schedule is small” said Robert W. Mann a consultant and former airline executive. He said travelers who do get on an alternate flight may end up having to stop or connect multiple times rather than flying direct.

While some airlines might be willing to put a passenger on another carrier that’s not always a choice Mann said — and some airlines don’t have the relationships with competitors to do that.

“It would cost them actual money to do that” Mann said. “They’d rather have you take their travel voucher or their subpar alternate schedule that they offer you.”

If you want to request a refund brace yourself for more delays. Getting a cash refund from airlines can be difficult — like very difficult. In fact DOT recently cracked down on wrongful denials and returned $600 million in refunds back to tens of thousands ofpassengers.

While the airline will likely offer you a flight credit or voucher first stay persistent if you really want your refund; it’s your right.

If your flight gets delayed

You may not know your flight is going to be delayed or rescheduled until the last minute — maybe even after you have arrived at the airport. Katherine Estep a spokeswoman for the advocacy group Airlines For America recommends downloading your carrier’s app to get immediate updates on your flight schedule.

Airlines are not required by law to refund travelers for delays; each airline has its own policy. But if your flight gets significantly delayed and you choose not to fly you are entitled to a refund per DOT regulations. However every airline has a different definition of “significant.” You will have to check with your carrier to find out if you’re eligible which can also depend on the circumstances of the delay. Even if you’re not you may be able to get compensation for the disruption. Ask the airline if you are eligible for a meal voucher or a hotel room for the night while you wait.

Don’t like the rebooked flight? “Keep an eye on backup plans” said Going founder Scott Keyes. “If your flight were to get canceled what are flights that this airline has that would work for me and my schedule?”

Once you have picked a new flight that works for you get on the phone with customer service and request it specifically.

“That’s going to be much more fruitful than saying ‘My flight got canceled what do I do?’” Keyes said.

If you want to be protected

There are a few things you can do to put yourself in a better position for this uncertain time of flying.

Protecting yourself starts when you book the flight. Brian Kelly the founder and chief executive of The Points Guy recommends booking your flights with frequent flier miles.

Share this article Share

“Most airline frequent-flier programs will actually refund your points and taxes and fees so it’s kind of like buying a refundable ticket” Kelly said. “They give you maximum flexibility.”

Look for nonstop flights to your destination that depart earlier in the day. You will have fewer variables to deal with and should something go wrong you’ll have more rerouting options than if you were departing later.

Martin Nolan a traveler rights expert at Skyscanner recommends booking a flight with a flexible fare that allows for a free date or destination change. He also suggests booking travel with a credit card that offers extra protections. A good credit card company will go to bat for you if you are struggling to get a rightfully owed refund.

Adit Damodaran economist at the travel booking app Hopper says it is wise to prepare for the worst by padding your trip with some buffer time if you’re traveling for a special event. Don’t cut your arrival too close; find a flight a day before in case there is a delay or cancellation. Hopper also has “Rebooking Protection Services” allowing travelers to fly on another airline if there is a disruption.

As of 1 p.m. the tracking site FlightAware.com listed 2681 flight cancellations worldwide for Saturday 948 involving flights into or out of the United States.

On Friday 2380 flights were canceled worldwide — 690 involving U.S. flights and 86 at LAX.

The scrapped flights were largely blamed on airline staffing shortages caused by the latest surge in coronavirus cases fueled by the Omicron variant. Weather issues were also causing some of the cancellations.

“We know some airline cancellations across the country are in the news. At LAX today our flights are showing over 90% on time right now with 25 cancellations out of 1028 scheduled flights” LAX tweeted at 9:23 a.m. Friday.

Five hours later the airport added: “We have seen some additional cancellations this evening so please check your flight status with your airline for the latest. Arrive early we will be busy tonight! Check parking at http://parking.flylax.com and @FlyLAXstats.”

LAX had not commented on Saturday’s cancellations as of late Christmas morning.

“When I ask the barista to please remake my drink because it looks about three shades lighter than NC40 and she says it was already made correctly” a text overlay on the video reads.

https://www.tiktok.com/@conniecantu/video/7042509305311939845?is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v1

The TikToker shows her first beverage then pulls out a second drink that is a slightly deeper shade of brown. The audio accompanying the video to which she lip-syncs says “that was embarrassing I really hope you’re embarrassed.”

Some users called the video “condescending” and said it was unnecessary when all she had to do was ask for the drink to be remade.

“Embarrassing?” one commenter wrote. “IDK mistakes happen. They will gladly fix the mistake. It’s not embarrassing. Just kinda a condescending audio.”

When another user implied that they thought it was a bit ridiculous that she was having a service worker remake a drink because it wasn’t the right color she clapped back saying that it was an expensive drink and she expected it to be made correctly.

“Or imaging paying extra for changes like coconut milk bc you can’t do dairy and not only they get the order wrong you get charged for it” she wrote. “Repeatedly.”

Other commenters agreed with her saying that if she paid for a drink to be made a specific way it should be made that specific way and produce the same results every time.

“Hi I’m a barista and espresso drinks should always turn out the same color” one commenter wrote. “If the espresso messed up—not your fault. We should remake it for you.”

When another commenter agreed that something was up with the drink and it looked like the espresso had been incorrectly prepared they asked the poster to kindly let someone know. The poster said she did but was frustrated with responses she consistently received over her drinks.

“I do let them know kindly” she wrote. “It’s just frustrating when they tell me I’m wrong or act like I’m being too picky. Moooost times they remake it no problem.”

Store hours vary by location and stores may occasionally adjust their hours based on business and customer needs. We recommend customers look for specific store hours using the Starbucks® app or by visiting our website store locator: Starbucks.com/store-locator. The Starbucks app continues to be the best way for customers to find a store check store hours order ahead and use contactless payment.

A few examples of Christmas Day hours for specific stores listed in the online locator tool include:

Starbucks Holiday Drinks Are Served While Supplies Last

Bankers with lots of money say it doesn ...,"2021 has not been a normal year. One final piece of evidence for its abnormality is that the standard seasonality of the banking recruitment market seems to have been upended. Headhunters are saying that they’re seeing as much as three times the usual level of activity in the fourth quarter. Since few investment bankers are going to be looking around in December this year in anticipation of a disappointing bonus round that means that there are firms out there who are prepared to buy out the entire 2021 compensation package effectively paying up for work they never benefited from. And according to Kevin Mahoney at Bay Street Advisors they’re paying a premium to do so – MD bonuses are being seen up 20-30% across the industry but some banks are prepared to pay total compensation increases of as much as 50% in the hottest sectors like tech and healthcare.

Not only that but clients are increasingly asking for “lift-out” deals. This is where you hire a senior MD and simultaneously make offers to all of his or her direct reports. Banks are often a bit nervous about doing this sort of thing – it makes your competition very angry and there can be some tricky legal issues raised if it is too obvious that you’ve been coordinating the move.

But for heads of investment banking who started the year in a cautious frame of mind and are now playing catch-up not being adequately staffed right now is unthinkable. The pipeline of deals for January looks just as strong as it did in 2021 and every month of 2022 that you’re understaffed will be one full of missed revenue opportunities. It seems that heads of department are rationalizing their December hiring strategies to themselves by presuming that even if they’re paying slightly over the odds they ought to make it back in revenue terms.

That could be a risky move of course. Anyone making an offer today will be doing incredibly well to get things closed by the year-end. And given that the vast majority of MDs will need to take three months’ gardening leave that means that your new expensive hire will be walking through the door at the end of March. With the time needed to give everyone their new phone number get new pitch books produced and so on a new rainmaker will be aiming to generate revenue in whatever market conditions prevail at the end of April – potentially mid-May.

This matters if you're a banker because the other difference from previous hiring cycles is that there seems to be much less use of multi-year guarantees. This means that the end-year hires are not quite as expensive as they look because although there’s an upfront signing-on bonus there’s no commitment for 2022 (beyond a degree of unenforceable “indication”) and certainly not for 2023. Anyone taking one of these big offers would be well advised to line up a few quick wins to impress the new boss as early as possible.

Elsewhere Spear’s the magazine for really rich people ends the year in philosophical mood asking “what does it all mean”? Of course it’s better to be rich than poor if only for financial reasons but once you’ve become an ultra-high-net-worth individual do you have to do some good with it if you want people to respect you? The answer appears to be yes.

Many of the people giving the message of philanthropy are super-successful bankers like John Studzinski and Guy Hands. But Morris Pearl former BlackRock MD gives an entire life cycle of what it’s like to feel rich. When you’re very young it means being able to buy a sandwich from the posh deli. A bit later on it’s owning a nice commuter house. Once you’ve had kids wealth means being able to tell them that they don’t need to worry about paying for college. And then finally (we think a few interim stages might have been skipped) you start feeling truly wealthy when you’ve got so many philanthropic activities going on that you need to hire a staff to manage them. What’s actually most interesting is that none of the people interviewed seemed to use the traditional banker’s measure of what it means to be rich; having that crucial bit more than the person on the desk opposite you.

She's just as excited about a quarter mile of St. Paul's long-buried Phalen Creek returning after nearly a century underground.

""Scientists look at water as H2O. We look at water as water is life"" she said of the creek which since the 1920s has been channeled through a sewer pipe to the Mississippi. ""I think [daylighting Phalen Creek] is so beautiful. It's like if you have a wound and there is scar tissue over it. Sometimes you open it up let air in. Help the healing.""

Officials with the Lower Phalen Creek Project a Native-led nonprofit launched 24 years ago in part to restore the creek that once meandered 4 miles from Lake Phalen to the Mississippi say they are on the verge of finally ""daylighting"" the creek. When they do Executive Director Maggie Lorenz said it will not only be spiritually and culturally significant to local Native Americans but ecologically important as well.

""[Phalen Creek] is an essential part of the community — it will bring more natural habitat and it means more opportunities for recreation and stormwater management"" said Lorenz who is Dakota and Ojibwe. ""And from a cultural perspective we are really interested in restoring the land and taking care of the land according to our traditional teachings.""

Last month the Lessard-Sams Outdoor Heritage Council recommended the project receive $3.2 million in state funding in 2022-23. The first quarter mile of the stream leaving the lake could be restored by 2025 Lorenz said. It is one of two segments of Phalen Creek that could feasibly be restored — the other is near Swede Hollow Park along the Bruce Vento Trail.

Where Phalen Creek may be restored.

Restoring even small parts of the waterway to something close to their natural state will improve water quality species habitat and the community's care of the creek said officials with the Ramsey-Washington Metro and Capitol Region watershed districts. Both organizations are working with the Lower Phalen Creek Project.

What's more daylighting will ease the effects of untreated stormwater that flows through a sewer pipe to the Mississippi carrying contaminants directly to the river.

""Daylighting allows treatment habitat restoration groundwater recharge"" said Elizabeth Hosch permit program manager with Capitol Region Watershed District. ""Even when doing [daylighting] in sections those benefits are available.""

Paige Ahlborg watershed project manager with the Ramsey-Washington Metro district that oversees the headwaters of the creek said creeks like Phalen were sunken underground because water was seen as getting in the way of development.

""Back when this was put underground that was just the way they did things"" she said.

Such thinking has changed. The benefits of surface water with shoreline vegetation and habitat not only are seen as restorative for water quality but attractive to developers and neighbors as well.

""Another benefit is just restoring a community's connection to the water"" Ahlborg said. ""Seeing it makes it harder to do things that harm it. We still have a number of people who think that 'if I put something down the [storm]sewer drain it will be treated.'""

But for Tara Perron a Dakota author and medicine maker the benefits of Phalen Creek's restoration are more heartfelt. Her late father always drew peace from the waters that flowed there even if they were unseen and polluted.

Returning even small sections of the creek to the way they were she said is healing.

""Lower Phalen Creek [Project] is so sensitive and caring about what they do"" Perron said. ""Even though it was polluted my father felt the spirituality of the place and he would clean it up. And when he did that I too felt something sacred there.""

Perron said she is certain her dad knows restoration is coming.

""I am sure he can feel it now too"" she said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXRlc21hbmpvdXJuYWwuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvMjAyMS8xMi8yNC93aGF0cy1iZWluZy1idWlsdC0yM3JkLXN0cmVldC1zb3V0aGVhc3Qtc2FsZW0tcHVibGljLXdvcmtzLzg5MzA2MDAwMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What's that being built on 23rd Street in southeast Salem?,"No commitment required.

It was an exciting day as the phone was the original Samsung Galaxy Fold and I was about to start life with it connected to what was billed as the latest and fastest cellular connection available.

More than two years later I now know one of these two technologies would reveal itself to be exciting enjoyable and beneficial while the other would turn out to be a massive waste of time and money.

Recommended Videos

Despite the Galaxy Fold’s shortcomings I quickly fell for it but for all its hype 5G has barely made any impact on my life at all and having it enabled on my phone in December 2021 is as pointless as it was more than two years ago.

Before going further I’ll point out that my experience almost certainly won’t precisely mirror your own. You may have better coverage in your area and you may have traveled around more for example. But I also expect it’ll still be difficult to actually name a specific benefit that exclusively came from 5G during this time regardless of whether the 5G symbol has been glowing brightly on your phone.

I remember the first time the 5G symbol showed up on my Galaxy Fold. It has stayed in my mind because not only did my first taste of 5G not come when I was connected to the network I paid for monthly but I wasn’t even in the same country. I had just gotten off a flight to Japan and was standing in Haneda airport in Tokyo using a Japanese SIM I’d purchased for use during my stay. I assume I had stumbled on a test site as 5G wasn’t prevalent in Tokyo at the time and I never received a 5G signal again after I left the airport.

The fact I had to travel thousands of miles before 5G eventually showed up on my Galaxy Fold set the tone for my continued use. I knew when I entered into the contract that my local area didn’t have 5G but as I lived a few miles from the U.K.’s second busiest airport I thought there was a good chance coverage would be slightly higher on the list for my network operator than somewhere in the countryside.

Today more than two years later there’s still no 5G coverage there. A town about 20 minutes away has a 5G signal which I used for a recent test. If I travel into London which is about 90 minutes away then 5G shows up more regularly but it’s certainly not all the time. It’s also shockingly inconsistent as I discovered when I performed a 5G phone test in another town. Despite a 5G logo showing on all the phones at the time I was informed in a conversation with a chip maker later on that the phone may not have actually been using a 5G connection at all.

Do I have hope 5G will come to my phone soon? I moved home late last year and according to my carrier’s coverage map my closest 5G location is a city about 30 minutes away by car. Right now as I write this I have one bar of 4G signal on my Galaxy Z Fold 3 at home so I’m not expecting 5G to arrive in the near future if this is the best it can do with 4G a technology that has been around since 2012. Not that it matters as I’ll now explain.

The pandemic and 5G

Barely six months into my shiny data-laden 5G contract the coronavirus pandemic happened. I’m prepared to give 5G a break for it not having much impact on my life during 2020 but my willingness to give 5G the benefit of the doubt only goes so far. For example our enforced time at home seemed like a great opportunity for networks and companies to show what 5G could do for services like virtual reality and videoconferencing but alas all we got was silence.

I did go out of my way to seek out a signal on more than one occasion and have visited more places in 2021 where 5G is easier to find. Each and every time outside of exclaiming surprise that I’m actually getting 5G on my phone (yes it’s still rare enough that it’s an occasion) I couldn’t list one benefit from it being there or one service app or experience that I could try out to really make use of it at all.

There is quite simply nothing to do with 5G. In 2019 I would have added that it’s early days and benefits will surely start to arrive in the future. After all that’s what we were being sold. It’s very nearly 2022 and I can’t recommend one thing to do with 5G on your phone that will even competently demonstrate how it’s markedly superior to top-level 4G let alone something so cool that it will blow your mind.

You could run a speed test and bask in the knowledge that the numbers on the screen will be a bit higher than the ones that would show on a 4G phone’s screen. You could download an app a podcast or a show from Netflix faster than with 4G but it’s never really that much faster in my experience. I also see some hideous lag using 5G as the modem phone and network all dither around sorting out the signal before a download kicks in — which negates the supposed speed benefit over just downloading with 4G.

There is quite simply nothing to do with 5G.

In 2021 5G lets you scrub through a YouTube video with very little lag webpages appear practically instantaneously and yes files do download quickly most of the time. That’s great except I saw all this when I first tested 5G in the U.K. and in Monaco and that was in summer 2019. Expecting something more than this now isn’t a big ask.

Am I expecting too much?

I’ve paid for 5G for two years so I don’t think it’s asking too much for it to appear on my phone once in a while or to have something specific to try out when it does. After all I’ve been hearing about how amazing 5G is (will be?) for even longer than that. Samsung called 2018 the “Year of 5G” at Mobile World Congress and gave attendees of the industry event a “glimpse at how user-centric 5G networks will soon transform our homes cars cities and more.”

It said 5G would help us move around in autonomous cars while watching ultra-high-definition movies inside let us play streaming games at home with one-millisecond latency and enable us to live in smart cities where 5G nodes were fitted inside street lamps. “A large portion of the 5G technologies that will enable the services being introduced at this year’s MWC are already at the commercialization stage” Samsung excitedly wrote at the time making it sound like these innovations were right around the corner.

Samsung concedes some of these advancements required the wide adoption of Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) networks and didn’t actually give a time frame for its predictions. But here we are coming up to three years after the presentation and FWA is still very much a work in progress with the benefits still discussed only as possibilities for the future. And Ookla’s mean latency speed for mobile networks in the U.S. in 2021 is 39 milliseconds. Still some way to go then.

In the same year the GSMA a mobile industry trade body put together a paper on the “socio-economic benefits of 5G services” in which it concentrated on mmWave 5G signals. It predicted 2024 would be “the year when 5G is expected to begin displaying a measurable impact on growth.” That’s just two years away now but Qualcomm — the loudest voice in the mmWave space — is still talking about mmWave in terms of “typical use cases” and not real situations and listing benefits that sound like science fiction. For example have you used 5G-driven augmented reality to see real-time stats and player information at a sports event recently? No me neither.

I’m sure it will all happen one day but Opensignal’s mid-2021 5G performance report showed that even for those people who do have access to a mmWave 5G signal they’d be connected to it less than 1% of the time and that was across AT&T T-Mobile and Verizon. It seems you could change the published date on both Samsung and the GSMA’s reports from 2018 to 2021 without fear of them reading like old news.

Whether you care or not it’s here

I cannot name one time I have been glad to have 5G on my phone. If I had stayed with a 4G contract in 2019 the following two years would have played out in exactly the same way. Even if I could get a 5G signal on a regular basis none of the transformational tech it’ll hopefully one day deliver is available for me to use or even test out. Simply put 5G has been a complete waste of my time and money and any advantage to having it over just a really good 4G signal is almost nonexistent.

Today almost all smartphones that cost more than $250 have a 5G modem inside and practically all phone contracts come with 5G data too. The days of paying a premium for 5G do seem to have passed as the technology has become mainstream. What a very good thing this is because while we may have access to 5G in 2021 we are still waiting for a reason for it to exist.

In an interview with The Washington Post the creative director of It Takes Two said that when he returns to film making “it’ll be like taking a vacation.”

“As someone who’s been on both sides doing six feature films and now four games I’m telling you: When I go back and make a movie — which I will someday in the future — it’ll be like taking a vacation”

He went on to explain that in games “we have an extreme amount of different mechanics and we need to take them to a level where it makes sense polish-wise. Not only that we had to create bosses enemies and all that and every boss takes around six to nine months to create. How it functions for the player is around five to six minutes of play but it’s an extreme amount of stuff in the background.”

Comparing games to films Fares said: “It’s interactive entertainment. You have your audience going loose and you’re creating everything from the ground up – [in films] you have an actor you have a human being you have a voice you have movement you have environment you have sound you have over 100 years of how to plan a movie and do a script. … And it’s a much more controllable medium.”

Elsewhere in the interview he said he has no ill will towards major film awards but stands by his comments about games deserving more respect from Hollywood.

Chen has been targeted by foreign sanctions over the crackdown targeting the Uygurs and other Muslim minorities in the region that he spearheaded prompting allegations of widespread human rights abuses from the United States and other Western countries.

Xinhua said Chen would be appointed to another post adding that he would be replaced by Ma Xingrui the governor of Guangdong province.

Guangdong is an important springboard for promotion in the Communist Party system. It remains unknown who will take over the post of Guangdong governor.

The changes are part of a wider reshuffle ahead of next year’s party congress where a new Politburo Standing Committee – the country’s top leadership body – will be unveiled.

Chen 66 one of the 25 members of the Politburo is the most senior Chinese official on the US sanctions list.

He was sanctioned last year “in connection with serious rights abuses against ethnic minorities” in Xinjiang which reportedly include mass arbitrary detention and severe physical abuse targeting Uygurs and other mainly Muslim minorities in the region.

In 2016 Chen was promoted to become party secretary of the region where the United Nations estimates about one million Uygurs have been detained in re-education camps. China describes the facilities as vocational skills training centres necessary to combat “extremism”.

Previously he had been the party chief in Tibet another region with a history of violence and uprisings against Beijing’s rule. Just months after his appointment in 2011 the region started advertising for another 2500 police officers.

Ma his replacement as Xinjiang party chief has been governor of Guangdong since 2017 having previously served as Shenzhen party boss from 2015.

The 62-year-old is also one of the country’s top scientists with a background in the aerospace industry.

After serving as general manager of the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation he was made director of the China National Space Administration in 2013 where he commanded China’s first successful lunar surface mission Chang’e 3.

Veterans of the country’s space programme have been promoted to important political roles in key provinces in recent years and Ma’s new role is likely win him a ticket to join the Politburo in the coming congress.

Wu Qiang a political analyst in Beijing said Chen’s replacement was likely to have little impact on policies in Xinjiang.

“The replacement cannot be called a response to international pressure” Wu said. “The pressure does exist but what Beijing did is the opposite – as Chen might be promoted to a higher level and the governance model in Xinjiang might be copied elsewhere in the country.”

However a Beijing-based expert on Xinjiang issues who declined to be named said the replacement might indicate the government wanted to add some new elements to its policy in Xinjiang arguing that “replacement definitely means new thoughts”.

Professor Song Xiaozhuang from Shenzhen University’s Centre for the Basic Laws of Hong Kong and Macau said Ma’s Guangdong experience might aid Xinjiang’s economic development as well as help fend off overseas accusations of “forced labour”.

“Guangdong’s economy has led the country in many aspects including in GDP. Ma is very familiar with the issue of ‘forced labour’ from his dealings with foreign investment from all over the world” Song said.

On Thursday US President Joe Biden signed into law a measure that will effectively ban all imports from Xinjiang saying it showed its determination to “combat forced labour” in the region.

The 1.5 GW capacity addition in the current fiscal year comprises more than 1.3GW of utility scale solar projects. These include 1.2 GW in Rajasthan 105 MW in Gujarat and 20 MW in Maharashtra. In wind projects over 150MW has been installed including 136MW in Karnataka and 22 MW in Gujarat.

All these capacity additions in FY22 are expected to offset over 75000 mn tCo2e of carbon emissions cumulatively. Around 1.05 GW of this organic capacity addition has a PPA with the Solar Energy Corporation of India an entity owned by the Government of India for 25 years.

Chairman and CEO of ReNew Sumant Sinha - recently awarded 'Chief Trailblazer of the Year' by S&P Global Platts Global Energy Awards - said ReNew continues to be at the heart of India's transformation as a clean energy leader.

""The major organic addition of 1.5GW of renewable energy projects this fiscal year and the fact that we have crossed 7GW of commissioned capacity shows we are well on track to achieve our aspirational goal of 18 GW by FY25"" he said. ""We will further intensify our efforts to help India achieve its climate goals including meeting half of its energy needs through renewables and also develop green hydrogen.""

ReNew recently announced a partnership with L&T for developing green hydrogen capacity.

The company's expansion of its operational capability comes as India looks at 500 GW of non-fossil fuel energy capacity by 2030 and by the same year reducing total projected carbon emissions by one billion tonnes as announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the COP26 Glasgow summit.

Saw this same thing on the older cars with ancient hardware and all of these ""features"" like farts and stupid stuff soak up too many of the already limited resources. Eventually you're left with an interface that's nearly unusable because the software's needs have outpaced the hardware's capability. Some of the main features that sold these cars early on (the browser is a good example) basically became broken. I wish they had locked the cars where they were years prior to that so the basic core functions still worked properly. One last solid ""bug fix and optimization"" build would do this older cars the justice they deserve.



Some are complaining about this on the newer cars but they should probably be thankful as it means that their current functions should continue working as they do now. Not a bad thing. I kind of wish Tesla would take a more deliberate approach to the firmware on these older cars to assure they remain functional in perpetuity more so than getting all the latest whiz bang features at the expense of foundational functionality.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vbWFzaGFibGUuY29tL2FydGljbGUvdGVzbGEtbWVnYXBob25lLXVwZGF0ZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla holiday update turns cars into megaphones,"Leave it to Tesla to turn a mandated safety feature into a prankster's dream.

As part of its holiday update the automaker has rolled out a feature that turns some Teslas into megaphones. At the press of a button anything drivers say will be emitted through external speakers. The external speakers only available in Teslas since 2019 were originally meant to serve as a required pedestrian warning system notes Electrek which first reported on the update.

In a demonstration shared to Twitter Tesla showed a driver shouting ""excuse me you dropped something"" at someone dressed as Santa after a gift fell from their arms.

But we can imagine Tesla drivers getting way more troll-y. Remember when Tesla added a ""boombox"" feature that let owners make their cars fart bleat like a goat and blast an airhorn like a '90s DJ? The megaphone builds off that suite of pre-programmed sounds.

Here's a video of YouTube creator Ryan Shaw testing out the megaphone noting that it lowers his voice as it broadcasts.

What could go wrong?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzEyLzI0L3Rlc2xhLWV4cGxvZGVzLWFmdGVyLW1lY2hhbmljcy1jaGFyZ2UtbWFuLTIzay1mb3ItbmV3LWJhdHRlcnkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Man explodes Tesla after mechanics charge $23K for a new battery,"The cost of a new Tesla Model S is about $95000 but the experience of blowing one up is priceless.

Finnish man Tuomas Katainen bought his Tesla in 2013 and it rode like a dream — for about the first 930 miles. “It was an excellent car” he said. “Then the error codes hit.”

After a month in the shop mechanics said he’d need the “whole battery cell” replaced at a price of 20000 euros or about $23900.

“So I told them I’m coming to pick up the Tesla” he said in a video produced by Finnish YouTuber Pommijätkät. “Now I’m going to explode the whole car away.”

More than 2.8 million have watched the eight-and-a-half-minute episode of the reality stunt web show which received a call from Katainen for help blowing up his out-of-warranty Tesla.

4 A Finnish man bought his Tesla in 2013 but when mechanics told him it would cost $23000 to fix the battery he decided to blow it up instead. YouTube

Crews set up the explosion at a former quarry in snowy Jaala in southern Finland where they flanked about 66 pounds (33 kilograms) of dynamite to the self-driving sedan.

The event wouldn’t be complete of course without Elon Musk in attendance — which naturally he was not. But the crew did go so far as to hire a helicopter to fly over the blast site and drop a crash test dummy with a portrait of Elon Musk glued to its face. It was also wearing a jumpsuit and a helmet for realism.

4 The vehicle rode well for about 930 miles before the battery gave out according to former Tesla owner Katainen. YouTube

Tesla has been fighting off a lot of negative feedback as of late. The carmaker is currently dealing with some heat from the government after the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced a probe into their built-in gaming console earlier this week. Tesla quickly responded and agreed to disable the “Passenger Play” feature from 580000 vehicles from their 2017 lines.

Last month Tesla also recalled 11700 cars over a faulty self-driving system following again a NHTSA investigation behind the cause of 11 crashes since 2018 of drivers using “autopilot.”

4 Experts strapped 30kg of dynamite to only one side of the car so they could plan for the direction of the shrapnel. YouTube

Evidently a $23000 bill to replace a battery is par for Tesla’s course while an Inverse investigation in October revealed a discrepancy between Tesla’s top dummy and the itemized receipts of disgruntled customers. Not only are their batteries less powerful and enduring as the company claims but Inverse also found reports of Musk in 2019 stating that a total battery replacement should cost between $5000 and $7000. But FindMyElectric.com found that all parts and labor told the final bill for their Model S Premium battery can put a customer out up to $20000.

Demolishing the whole thing however was free. So when asked what’s more valuable — a working Tesla or the thrill of blowing it up Katainen had to say: “Maybe more explosion.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzEyLzI0LzIyODUyNzk0L3Rlc2xhLWhvbGlkYXktc29mdHdhcmUtdXBkYXRlLW1lZ2FwaG9uZS1mZWF0dXJlLXNwZWFrZXJz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla update lets drivers turn their cars into megaphones,"As part of its annual holiday software update Tesla has released a new feature that lets drivers turn their cars into megaphones.

The update was spotted by Electrek which reports that it’s only available in newer Tesla models (2019 or later). This is because the feature uses external speakers that were installed in recent Tesla vehicles to meet US regulations. These regulations stipulate that otherwise silent electric cars should be able to alert pedestrians to their presence at low speeds.

A video of the feature (below) captures these external speakers repeating everything the driver says with a slight delay and an echo-y bass-heavy distortion. It’s not clear if this distortion can be changed or removed.

It’s not the first creative use Tesla has found for its cars’ external speakers. A Boombox mode introduced in last year’s holiday update let owners replace the default horn sound with any custom audio clip while Sentry Mode which lets owners stream live footage from the cars’ external cameras also includes a remote audio function.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlcGFpcmVyZHJpdmVubmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMS8xMi8yNC9paWhzLXJlY29nbml6ZXMtZWZmZWN0aXZlbmVzcy1vZi10ZXNsYXMtY2FtZXJhLW9ubHktY3Jhc2gtYXZvaWRhbmNlLXN5c3RlbS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,IIHS recognizes effectiveness of Tesla's camera-only crash-avoidance system,"Share This:

A “superior” rating for its camera-only front collision prevention technology has led the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety to restore the 2021-22 Tesla Model Y’s Top Safety Pick+ award the organization’s top safety rating.

IIHS said that the crash-prevention system on Tesla Model 3 vehicles built after April 2021 when Tesla stopped equipping them with radar also earns a “superior” rating in both vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-pedestrian evaluations as a result of a software update.

IIHS had stripped the Model Y and Model 3 of their Top Safety Pick+ awards after Tesla announced that the two vehicles would use its camera-based Tesla Vision system going forward.

“Model Y vehicles built after April 2021 meet all the criteria for the ‘plus’” IIHS said in a Dec. 21 statement. “Following a conversion to a camera only system the standard front crash prevention system earns superior ratings in both the vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-pedestrian tests.”

The change in technology led the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to drop the non-radar cars’ listing as having automatic braking or a front collision warning system. NHTSA at the time explained that it “only includes check marks for the technologies on a vehicle model that have been either verified by NHTSA or reported by the vehicle manufacturers as meeting NHTSA’s performance criteria. We removed the check mark because we have no test results for Tesla’s recent changes.”

NHTSA has yet to restore the check marks for forward collision warning crash imminent braking or dynamic brake support. It gives the Model Y five out of five stars for its performance in crash testing.

Most OEMs’ ADAS systems rely on a combination of cameras radar and lidar units. Radar systems and cameras are relatively inexpensive. Among the three radar stands out for working well in poor weather but it lacks the resolution of the other .

To be eligible for the IIHS Top Safety Pick+ award vehicles must be available with a front crash prevention system that earns advanced or superior ratings in both tests.

Other criteria for Top Safety Pick+ awards include “good” ratings in six IIHS crashworthiness evaluations and standard headlights that are rated as “good” or “acceptable” in all trim lines. For the lower-tier Top Safety Pick award at least one “good” or “acceptable” headlight system must be offered.

Then there was Shar Dubey. As other C.E.O.s avoided the controversy Ms. Dubey — the chief executive of Match Group which runs online dating sites including Match.com OKCupid and Tinder — confronted it head-on.

“As a Texas resident I am shocked that I now live in a state where women’s reproductive laws are more regressive than most of the world including India” she said in an email to employees while announcing she was creating a fund to support Match employees affected by the new law. “Surely everyone should see the danger of this highly punitive and unfair law.”

This tradition was originally made popular in 2018 and updated in 2019 with a holiday feature by IPWatchdog Founder Gene Quinn: The Most Iconic (and Patented) Toys and Games of All Time. The original post included iconic toys such as “the Video Game Console Barbie doll Monopoly Rubik’s Cube Battleship Super Soaker Hoola Hoop Slinky Play-Doh Easy Bake Oven Game-Boy Frisbee YoYo Lego blocks Transformers Tricycles Bicycles Scooters Tonka trucks Rocking Horse Twister Simon Magic 8 Ball Erector Set Etch A Sketch Bunch-o-Balloons and Mr. Potato Head.” Last year an updated list was published: More Iconic (and Patented) Toys and Games: A 2020 Update including updates to the prior list such as the Red Ryder BB gun Teddy Ruxpin Little Tykes Toy Coupe Koosh Ball Furby Mousetrap Game Lite-Bright Stretch Armstrong Lincoln Logs and Skip-It.

Here are a few more that have brought smiles to the faces of so many on Christmas Day over the years.

Elf on the Shelf

The Elf on the Shelf Christmas tradition has been around since about 2004 when Carol Aebersold filed two trademark applications one for the words “The Elf on the Shelf” and one for this elf drawing of the beloved Elf on the shelf. It was registered for goods such as elf dolls and children’s books sold as a unit. The stylized version of “the Elf on the Shelf” was filed in 2008 and assigned U.S. Registration No. 3553223.

According to tradition and the story the accompanies the Elf on the Shelf doll the elves are Santa’s helpers and they keep an eye on children and report back to Santa each night when they fly back to the North Pole. Each morning children are delighted to wake up to find their elf in a new spot in the house. Parents have become an active part of the tradition by “helping” the elves find new places to hide or play around the house. Countless articles have been devoted to ideas for making your Elf on the Shelf the most interesting elf in the neighborhood such as making your elf a sled out of candy canes or tangling your elf up in dental floss.

Mounted Mechanical Fish

In the late 1990s and early 2000s it was rare to find a person who did not know of or own a mechanical singing fish mounted on a plaque. Those who were very lucky even woke up on Christmas morning to find one under the Christmas tree! The one pictured to the left was the subject of U.S. D440525 issued April 17 2001 to Think Tek Inc. Think Tek’s mechanical mounted fish was marketed as the Boogie Bass and sung songs and played back phrases while moving around and opening and closing its mouth. Several other similar products were introduced around the same time period but none of them including Think Tek’s patented version was nearly as popular as the Big Mouth Billy Bass which is protected by trademark Registration No. U.S. 4944012. Big Mouth Billy Bass is arguably the most successful product ever produced by Gemmy Industries. The animatronic singing fish played Al Green’s “Take Me to the River” and “Don’t Worry Be Happy.” According to an interview statement by Al Green the use of his song in the popular singing fish had earned him more royalties than any other recorded versions of the song.

Chatty Cathy Talking Doll

No list of iconic toys is complete without a talking doll! The Chatty Cathy Talking Doll was introduced in the early 1960s and was marked with patent number U.S. 3017187 titled “Multiple Speech Phonograph.” The patent related to a phonograph that may be embodied in a doll. According to the patent a child may cause the doll to speak or pronounce a number of different sentences by pulling of a drawstring. The first Chatty Cathy Talking Doll had blue eyes and blonde hair and she randomly recited 11 phrases such as “I love you” and “Tell me a story.” Such talking dolls have been the subject of many little girls’ dreams (and possibly some nightmares as well). Recently Chatty Cathy served as the inspiration for a talking doll character named Gabby Gabby in Toy Story 4. Gabby Gabby had a dark side that is said to be inspired by another spin off of Chatty Cathy an evil doll named Talky Tina who appeared in a 1963 “Twilight Zone” episode. Chatty Cathy is also the subject of several dead trademarks and one pending U.S. Trademark Application U.S. 88620210.

Speak & Spell

The Speak & Spell was created by Texas Instruments and sold between 1978 and 1992. U.S. Patent No. 4516260 for an “Electronic Learning Aid or Game Having Synthesized Speech” is one of Texas Instrument’s patent’s directed to the Speak & Spell. What began as a three-month feasibility study with a $25000 budget became the invention of the Speak & Spell “marked the first time the human vocal tract had been electronically duplicated on a single chip of silicon” and a primitive version of the synthetic speech technology that drives things like Alexa today. The Speak & Spell remained poplar throughout the late 1970’s and 1980’s and was boosted by its appearance in the movie “E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial” where it was used by E.T to “phone home.”

Pogo Stick

For over 50 years the perfect gift for any energetic and determined child has been a pogo stick. The first modern two-handed pogo stick was issued in February 1955 to G.B. Hansburg as U.S. Patent No. 2793036. The object of the ‘036 invention was to provide a pogo stick that was “neat compact and durable and not likely to become deranged even with long use which may be made from relatively inexpensive components and readily assembled at low cost and which in addition to functioning in the manner of a conventional pogo stick may readily be set for adjustment of its recoil to an amount which depends upon the weight of the user to prevent injury to the latter due to excessive recoil action.”

Dominos

Dominos is an iconic game that has been played by young and old for many years. One particular colored set was patented on May 29 1883 as U.S. Patent No. 278646 wherein each number was distinguished by a separate color. As shown in Figure 1 the spots are distinguished by different shading or coloring. Alternatively the spots may be colored alike and the spaces between the spots may be distinguished by different shading or coloring.

Flying Ring

The flying ring patented on October 16 1973 as U.S. Patent No. 3765122 is a ring shaped flying toy including an annular skirt and a central circular opening. When the ring is “tossed by a person and caused to spin about its axis while traveling through the air an air stream flowing over the toy’s leading edge will be guided by the deflector surface downwardly into the central opening and thereafter directed beneath the toy’s trailing edge to support the trailing edge in flight.”

View-Master

Originally the View-Master was developed as much for adults as for children. The device described in U.S. Patent No. 2189285 was marketed from 1939 to 1950 and was sold alongside View-Master reels which featured scenery of interest to adults. Claim 1 of the ‘285 patent recited in part “[a] disk … having fourteen windows formed therein in each of which is mounted a transparency means for viewing a pair of diametrically opposite transparencies simultaneously means for moving said disk to expose in alternate succession whereby a cycle of views can be shown in repeated succession without inversion.” In the late 1940s the View-Master Model C was marketed towards children and was the subject of U.S. Patent No. 2511334 titled “Stereoscopic Viewer.” The ‘334 patent issued to Wilhelm Gruber in June 1950. The patent was directed to “a stereoscopic device adapted for viewing stereoscopic pictures arranged in circular or disc form whereby the disc can be inserted and removed with a minimum amount of effort skill or care on the part of the user.” In particular the device was designed to be easy to use for a child. View-Masters continue to delight adults and children alike and are still available from many retailers.

Sock Monkey

The Sock Monkey has been an iconic toy for generations and was made using a particular type of socks called “Nelson Red Heel Rockford Socks” for which Nelson Knitting Company was awarded trademark Serial No. U.S. 71532152. On July 14 1953 Helen Cooke was awarded Design Patent No. 170008 for a sock doll design which claimed the classic Sock Monkey. Cooke filed suit against a man named Stanley Levy for selling dolls of a design not made by Cooke. Levy contacted Nelson Knitting Company and the Company gathered evidence that others had been making similar dolls for over two years prior to the filing of Cookes’ patent. Cooke eventually settled the case against Levy and sold the sock monkey doll patent to Nelson Knitting for $750 in 1955. Nelson began including instructions for making the Sock Monkey on every package of Rockford Red Heel Socks.

POMPEY — Dan Palladino remembers exactly where he was when he decided to finally walk away from a very successful and lucrative career with Thermo Fisher Scientific and concentrate on his family’s farm in Pompey full-time. It was 2011 and Palladino was attending a leadership conference in Boston. One of the speakers that day referred to his childhood on a small dairy farm in New England. This piqued Palladino’s interest as he too had grown up on a family farm eschewed the family business and gone into the corporate world.

The speaker a senior-level executive told a story of the day he turned 18 and was approached by his father to discuss transitioning the farm for his eventual takeover to which the son replied “No thanks. I’d like to get a real job.” According to Palladino the room erupted with laughter. He on the other hand was shocked by this supposed punchline. A real job? What could be more real than a family working the land together over multiple generations he thought. Hard work. Tradition. Family. Heritage these formed the foundation of his success and he learned them on the farm.

As he sat in Boston that fateful day Palladino had his feet in both worlds; one in the barn and one in the boardroom. Having left the farm to go to college eventually attaining his MBA from the University of Rochester Palladino settled in Rochester. After his father Nick Sr. passed away in 2009 his uncles were set to sell the farm which was limping along. Dan overcome with a feeling that his children needed to grow up on the farm as he and his older brother Nick had done offered to buy it and keep it in the Palladino family — as it has been since 1951.

A short while after the Boston conference Palladino left Thermo Fisher and turned his attention to the daily operations of Palladino Farms. A decade later the farm (now in its 177th year of cultivation) and its Heritage Hill Brewhouse are thriving bringing a renewed vitality to the pastoral landscape in Pompey.

The story of Palladino Farms and Heritage Hill Brewhouse goes all the way back to 1845 when the land was first cleared and cultivated. German immigrant Morris Beard settled the property and cleared acres of hemlock. Beard also built the beautiful Greek Revival farmhouse that still functions as the family homestead. Beard eventually sold the property to the Hamilton Family and moved to Fayetteville where he developed much of that township. After the purchase the Hamiltons owned nearly 1000 acres and continued to farm much of the land until the 1940s when they put it up for sale.

In 1941 Nunzio Palladino the family patriarch and Dan’s grandfather investigated purchasing the property from the Hamilton family but held off. Like Morris Beard before him Nunzio Palladino was an immigrant to the United States after he and his parents left their hometown of Guardiaregia in Fascist-controlled Italy in 1928 as a 16-year-old.

Settling in East Syracuse where his family had been sponsored by a local family the Albaneses he worked for the New York Central Railroad. In 1933 Nunzio married Christine Albanese herself an Italian immigrant. The couple would go on to have seven children including Michael Nicholas and Anthony each of whom would follow in their father’s footsteps.

In 1951 a roughly 300-acre portion of the old Hamilton tract that Nunzio passed on buying a decade earlier went back on the market and he purchased it. He moved his family from Jamesville to Sweet Road and into the farmhouse built by Beard in the 1840s.

In the beginning the Palladinos focused on dairy farming and they ran a moderately sized and successful operation. Near the end of the 1950s Nunzio frustrated with several of his farm-equipment suppliers approached the Indiana–based Oliver Corporation looking to become a dealer. In 1961 Nunzio Palladino founded N. Palladino & Sons Farm Equipment a licensed Oliver Corp. dealer. The business built a massive equipment showroom. In 1965 N. Palladino & Sons were named the Oliver Corp. Dealership of the Year for the U.S.

In 1978 Palladino Farms was selected as the host for the Empire Farm Days the largest agricultural show in the Northeast. The farm hosted the event for the next three years with an average annual attendance of 100000 people. In 1979 a massive fire destroyed the farm-equipment showroom. The Palladinos rebuilt it across from the farmhouse on Sweet Road (it now houses Holbrook Heating & Air Conditioning). The early 1980s were difficult for many family farms in the area as consolidation forced many into foreclosure. Palladino Farms was able to weather the storm through these challenging times. Empire Farm Days returned to the farm in 1986 and 1987. In 1986 Gov. Mario Cuomo landed at the Empire Farm Days in a helicopter to sign legislation designed to help New York state agriculture and the state’s farmers. That next year both Nunzio and his wife Christine passed away having built a very successful farm and farm-equipment business. Nick Sr. and his brothers Michael and Anthony continued to operate the farm.

As the market shifted towards more demand for organic products the farm started the process of becoming a registered organic farm transitioning its pastureland first. The farm-equipment business which had morphed into a parts-service business in its later years closed for good in 2005 but the Palladinos continued to operate the beef and crop farm.

In April 2009 Nick Sr. passed away at the age of 70 setting in motion the course of events that brought Dan Palladino back to Pompey. Since returning to Palladino Farms full-time in 2011 Dan has kept the 300-acre farm focused on beef and crops including corn oats soybeans and wheat. The popularity of the beef cattle and the farm’s meat products led Dan to the idea of opening a restaurant a long-time dream of his (Palladino started his college career in hotel and restaurant management).

In 2016 he opened the Farm Store to sell a variety of products from his family’s farm and other local farms. The success of the that business in conjunction with the new spate of New York State farm brewery legislation made a brewery a logical next step. Finally in 2019 Palladino Farms formally opened Heritage Hill Brewhouse a farm-to-table style restaurant with Colorado brewer and high school classmate John Farzee. Fitting the name they built the new building on the site of the former showroom that burned down in 1979.

Heritage Hill Brewhouse prides itself on being a vertically integrated New York farm brewery. To meet that stringent requirement at least 60 percent of the hops and 60 percent of all other ingredients in Heritage Hill’s beers and seltzers must be sourced from within New York state. In fact a good amount of grain and hops are estate grown and until 2020 the farm was one of the largest producers of malt barley in the state. Leaving as little to waste as possible all the grain waste from the brewing process is recycled on the farm as feed for the cattle.

In 2019 its first year in existence Heritage Hill won a bronze medal at the Great American Beer Festival in Denver Colorado. In 2021 Heritage Hill Brewhouse and head brewer Billie Smith won two medals (gold and silver) in the New York State Brewers’ Association Craft Beer Competition. The brewery is currently undergoing a major expansion to double its fermenting capacity a sign of Heritage Hill’s growing success in the ultra-competitive craft beer market. In June 2021 Palladino announced that Empire State Farm Days was returning to Palladino Farms for the first time since 1987. The event which was held Aug. 3-5 2021 was an incredible success and drew tens of thousands of visitors the area. In November 2021 Heritage Hill and the Onondaga Historical Association partnered to build The Brewseum at Heritage Hill a new facility dedicated to showcasing the incredible brewing history of Onondaga County.

As the Palladino family enters its 70th year working the historic farm the future for this diversifying and growing third-generation family business is as bright as it has ever been.

Cortaderia selloana (CS) is a grass of the Poaceae family of the Danthonioideae subfamily commonly known as Pampas grass and native to South America. However in the last few decades CS was introduced in a wide diversity of countries worldwide including the USA Australia and Western Europe2. In these locations CS has strikingly spread and it is classified as an invasive species. Within Europe France Great Britain Portugal and Spain are strongly colonised. The United States Department of Agriculture in a report of 2014 stated: 'Cortaderia selloana obtained a relatively high impact potential risk score because it impacts natural anthropogenic and production systems'3. For this reason it has been forbidden to commercialise plant or maintain in a variety of countries. One of such countries is Spain where CS has intensively spread along the northern cost including the regions of Galicia Asturias Cantabria and the Basque Country4567. First report mentioning Cortaderia in Spain are from 1953 in Cantabria8.

The allergic incidence of CS is unknown. CS has been referred to as a danger to autochthonous species strongly affecting biodiversity and landscape. Moreover it is sporadically mentioned in some venues and discussion groups as a danger to humans because of material machinery damage and health such as cuts due to the sharp nature of its leaves or allergic reactions in contact with the skin91011. However despite the striking expansion of the grass in regions where it is not autochthonous there are no studies on the impact on human health so far reported worldwide.

CS has strongly colonised extensive areas of Cantabria a typical Northern Spanish region (Fig. 1AB) of about 500000 inhabitants most significantly during 1990–2008 a period of intensive road and house building612. CS has mainly invaded the coast but it also has reached the inland mountains (Fig. 1B–F). The plant has spread by human activities. It is used in motorways to retain the road slope soil and as a natural barrier1314 and it is transported with construction aggregates and gravel from stone quarries. Therefore it is consistently found next to roads new buildings or small paths covered with gravel and is abundant around stone quarries (Fig. 1C–F). Plans for limiting and eradicating the growth of this invasive plant have been debated in the local parliament due to pressure of ecologist organisations although only limited programmes were implemented. Currently the European Union is funding a regional network for fighting the inland expansion of the grass and diffusing the rapidly increasing problem among the European society (3.5 million euros for 2018–202215). However the presence of CS on the northern cost of Spain is still overwhelming.

Cantabria is a good paradigmatic territory to investigate the allergenic effects of CS on the human population. In Cantabria autochthonous grass pollens peak from April to July11617 when they cause a concomitant peak of hay fever. It is estimated that the percent of the population suffering from grass-associated hay fever in Cantabria is about 19% of patients diagnosed of rhinoconjunctivitis and 14% of asthmatic patients18. In contrast to the autochthonous grasses CS in the North of Spain flourishes from mid August to October 5. Grass pollens of the Pooideae subfamily the main grasses found in temperate climates of the North Hemisphere contain proteins with similarities in their antigens1920. We questioned whether patients allergic to the autochthonous grass pollen (Phleum pratense Phl as representative species) might also be allergic to CS pollen. Allergenic molecules of groups 1 and 5 (Phl p1 and Phl p5) are main antigens inducing allergies due to their high capacity to bind to immunoglobulin IgE of the human immune system. To investigate this issue we analysed the skin reaction to Phl and CS extracts of 98 patients of Cantabria that were allergic to local grass pollen. In addition we determined the presence of specific IgE antibodies (sIgE) to Phl and CS pollen extracts and to the single allergens Phl p 1 Phl p 5 Phl p 7 and Phl p 12 in blood serum. We also compared the seasonal symptoms with reported grass pollen counts. The results very strongly suggest that CS is a significant cause of respiratory allergies at a similar extent as the local grass. This might thus extend the period of respiratory allergies in the region for more than three months every year. This is the first study reported on the effects of the striking expansion of CS on human health and it has implications in all the regions of the world where CS has become a widespread invasive grass. Considering the implications that respiratory allergies have on health not only by the direct effects but also by allowing opportunist infections our results suggest that CS can constitute a significant public health issue. This risk must be added to the ecological impact in order to encourage efforts for eradicating CS from invaded non-autochthonous regions.",,,,,,,,,

Evans who served for 24 years in the United States Navy helped restart the local DAV chapter to help ensure that veterans have access to the benefits available to them.

As a member of the Navy from November 1968 until March 1992 Evans served as a sonar technician and achieved the rank of chief petty officer. Evans said he served on destroyers throughout his career.

""I just did my duty and didn't do anything extraordinary"" Evans said.

After retiring from the Navy Evans moved back to Siloam Springs and then worked for a time at Ozark Electronics in Gravette.

Evans spent a year there before moving on to Syroco as an electrician to help set up a department there. After spending several more years working for different companies like Marrs Electric in Springdale and Franklin Electric he began working for the Veterans Administration in Fayetteville.

He retired from the VA in 2013 after working for 10 years there he said. In 2002 Evans graduated from John Brown University with a degree in organizational management he said.

Evans joined DAV Chapter 50 in Siloam Springs and was a member until the chapter folded due to what Evans referred to as a ""power struggle"" according to an article in the Siloam Springs Herald-Leader on Jan. 28 2018.

Like many other veterans from the now-defunct DAV Chapter 50 Evans started attending the Springdale chapter. As a member of the Springdale chapter he became the go-to person in the western portion of Benton County so he had experience helping veterans in need Evans said.

In 2016 Evans had spoken to different members of the old Siloam Springs chapter and they all said they would like to see a new chapter of DAV in Siloam Springs Evans said.

""I knew there might be some interest in it so I asked around and asked the guys and so I said 'If you guys are willing I'll try to get it started'"" Evans said. ""So some of the other existing veterans here that were DAV members said that they would transfer into our chapter.""

The state chapter of DAV was excited at the prospect of starting a new chapter in Siloam Springs and agreed to Evans' request. It took a couple of years after Evans started the process for the club to be formed he said.

Part of the requirement to start a chapter involves getting 50 new members to join but in the case of Siloam Springs the national DAV organization waived half of the required number so Evans only needed to get 25 members to start the club.

Evans took it upon himself to start the process he said. In 2017 the state DAV and Evans set up a recruitment effort outside Siloam Springs.

He did not remember exactly when in 2017 the recruitment effort was held but said the state sent past state commander Richard Egan and its mobile unit to help with the process.

""He transferred a bunch of people in at the time so that we could have elections and officers"" Evans said.

In April of 2018 Evans received a letter stating that Siloam Springs had a new chapter of Disabled American Veterans he said.

The chapter was named Siloam Springs Disabled American Veterans Chapter 64 Evans said. At first Evans said he tried to get Siloam Springs' original chapter number back but the state denied his request. The next step was to have an organizational meeting which was held a month later Evans said.

""So we had an organizational meeting in May"" Evans said. ""We had their state adjutant come up and help run the meeting at that time there and just to help direct me on what I am supposed to do.""

For Evans being the commander was new for him he said. Evans had served as an officer for the Springdale chapter but taking charge was different he said.

Evans did all of the legal paperwork and in late 2018 the chapter received its nonprofit status which allowed the group to have fundraisers and apply for grants Evans said.

The state provided funds for Evans to help set up the Siloam Springs chapter of DAV he said. Little by little the Siloam Springs chapter began reaching out to help veterans in need Evans said.

When the Siloam Springs chapter began it had a little bit of money so the chapter only could help with $25 or maybe $50 to help here and there Evans said.

Today the Siloam Springs chapter can now help out a little bit better Evans said.

Presently the DAV chapter meets at 6 p.m. on the third Thursday of the month at the VFW hall Evans said. The chapter started out there but a lack of funds prevented it from remaining there Evans said.

The DAV chapter found a temporary home at John Brown University until the coronavirus pandemic started and the campus closed to the public Evans said.

The VFW voted to allow the club to return and meet at the VFW hall in exchange for help with other expenses Evans said. The pandemic provided other challenges for the chapter.

""We were not allowed to have meetings from the state at that point for quite a few months"" Evans said.

When the state did allow the chapter to meet it was at first limited to 10 people then 50 and 100 and then the number was reduced back to 10 Evans said.

After several false starts the DAV chapter started meeting again in June 2020 Evans said.

The future looks bright for DAV Chapter 64 Evans said. It is increasing membership and the current members are interested in doing different activities and fundraisers he said.

A popular fundraiser has been selling hot dogs at Atwood's. However the state limited the chapter to only one fundraiser a year in 2019 and the pandemic put an end to future fundraisers a year later. Plans are in the works to move the hot dog fundraiser to Tractor Supply Co. Evans said.

The DAV chapter also holds its Forget Me Not fundraiser at Harps in Siloam Springs and Gentry Evans said. The most recent fundraiser was on Nov. 17.

""We do it a couple three times a year at least"" Evans said. ""So it's very helpful.""

Every fall the DAV chapter hosts an annual Socks for Troops Evans said. Socks for Troops is a fundraiser in which people can donate socks or purchase socks to donate to DAV which would turn around and donate them to the VA home in Fayetteville Evans said.

The event is held from Nov. 1 to Dec. 31 Evans said. Anyone who wished to donate socks would bring them to Shoe Sensation where DAV has a box set up Evans said.

This year the VA home told Evans that it had a surplus of socks so Evans plans to donate them to the VA hospital which is also located in Fayetteville he said.

Evans said he wants people to know that DAV is here to help veterans with claims and benefits which is in the organization's mission statement. As a certified service officer Evans is able to help veterans to obtain the benefits they need he said.

This will be Evans' last year as commander of Siloam Springs' DAV chapter. Evans said he wants to get some new blood in the leadership. Evans plans to step down around June of next year he said.

Despite stepping down Evans will remain a member and will remain a service officer for the chapter he said.

""We're here to help the veterans in our community"" Evans said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Here's how to get a refund.,"This story has been updated. While the airline industry has worked out a lot of its issues caused by the pandemic it’s still not always smooth sailing for air travelers. According to the Department of Transportation flight cancellations stayed below 2 percent during the first four months of 2023 lower than the 2.7 percent cancellation rate of 2022.

Most recently United Airlines canceled hundreds of flights ahead of the July 4 holiday due to weather and equipment issues affecting about 150000 travelers.

If you’re an unlucky flyer who ends up stuck this summer we compiled a guide for what to do if your flight gets canceled and how to get a refund you are owed.

If your flight gets canceled

The bad news is your flight has been canceled. The good news is the airline owes you a refund; Department of Transportation regulations entitle you to one regardless of the reason your flight was canceled. DOT released an online dashboard last year to show travelers a quick view of what airlines offer for passengers affected by cancellations and delays.

But be warned: Accepting the canceled flight getting your money back and starting from scratch may put you in a position of scrambling for a more expensive flight if you can find one at all. Then there’s the risk that your new flight may be canceled or delayed. You may want to reschedule your flight with the airline instead of going for the refund.

More bad news if a flight is canceled: It may take a long time to get rescheduled especially during peak travel periods when flights are already packed. Some small airlines don’t have multiple flights a day or might only fly a few days a week.

“When they cancel one of those remaining flights the number of empty seats on what remains in their schedule is small” said Robert W. Mann a consultant and former airline executive. He said travelers who do get on an alternate flight may end up having to stop or connect multiple times rather than flying direct.

While some airlines might be willing to put a passenger on another carrier that’s not always a choice Mann said — and some airlines don’t have the relationships with competitors to do that.

“It would cost them actual money to do that” Mann said. “They’d rather have you take their travel voucher or their subpar alternate schedule that they offer you.”

If you want to request a refund brace yourself for more delays. Getting a cash refund from airlines can be difficult — like very difficult. In fact DOT recently cracked down on wrongful denials and returned $600 million in refunds back to tens of thousands ofpassengers.

While the airline will likely offer you a flight credit or voucher first stay persistent if you really want your refund; it’s your right.

If your flight gets delayed

You may not know your flight is going to be delayed or rescheduled until the last minute — maybe even after you have arrived at the airport. Katherine Estep a spokeswoman for the advocacy group Airlines For America recommends downloading your carrier’s app to get immediate updates on your flight schedule.

Airlines are not required by law to refund travelers for delays; each airline has its own policy. But if your flight gets significantly delayed and you choose not to fly you are entitled to a refund per DOT regulations. However every airline has a different definition of “significant.” You will have to check with your carrier to find out if you’re eligible which can also depend on the circumstances of the delay. Even if you’re not you may be able to get compensation for the disruption. Ask the airline if you are eligible for a meal voucher or a hotel room for the night while you wait.

Don’t like the rebooked flight? “Keep an eye on backup plans” said Going founder Scott Keyes. “If your flight were to get canceled what are flights that this airline has that would work for me and my schedule?”

Once you have picked a new flight that works for you get on the phone with customer service and request it specifically.

“That’s going to be much more fruitful than saying ‘My flight got canceled what do I do?’” Keyes said.

If you want to be protected

There are a few things you can do to put yourself in a better position for this uncertain time of flying.

Protecting yourself starts when you book the flight. Brian Kelly the founder and chief executive of The Points Guy recommends booking your flights with frequent flier miles.

Share this article Share

“Most airline frequent-flier programs will actually refund your points and taxes and fees so it’s kind of like buying a refundable ticket” Kelly said. “They give you maximum flexibility.”

Look for nonstop flights to your destination that depart earlier in the day. You will have fewer variables to deal with and should something go wrong you’ll have more rerouting options than if you were departing later.

Martin Nolan a traveler rights expert at Skyscanner recommends booking a flight with a flexible fare that allows for a free date or destination change. He also suggests booking travel with a credit card that offers extra protections. A good credit card company will go to bat for you if you are struggling to get a rightfully owed refund.

Adit Damodaran economist at the travel booking app Hopper says it is wise to prepare for the worst by padding your trip with some buffer time if you’re traveling for a special event. Don’t cut your arrival too close; find a flight a day before in case there is a delay or cancellation. Hopper also has “Rebooking Protection Services” allowing travelers to fly on another airline if there is a disruption.

Keyes strongly urges travelers to skip checking a bag.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnNuZXdzLmNvbS9waGlsYWRlbHBoaWEvbmV3cy9waGlsYWRlbHBoaWEtdHJhdmVsLWNvdmlkLWZsaWdodHMtYWlycG9ydC1ob2xpZGF5LWNocmlzdG1hcy10c2EtY2FuY2VsbGF0aW9ucy1hbWVyaWNhbi1haXJsaW5lcy1kZWx0YS_SAZQBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2JzbmV3cy5jb20vYW1wL3BoaWxhZGVscGhpYS9uZXdzL3BoaWxhZGVscGhpYS10cmF2ZWwtY292aWQtZmxpZ2h0cy1haXJwb3J0LWhvbGlkYXktY2hyaXN0bWFzLXRzYS1jYW5jZWxsYXRpb25zLWFtZXJpY2FuLWFpcmxpbmVzLWRlbHRhLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Philadelphia Travelers Take To The Skies On Christmas Day As COVID Surge Impacts Flights Nationwide,"PHILADELPHIA (CBS) -- Christmas is finally here and some folks decided to wait until Saturday to take flight at Philadelphia International Airport. Lines moved along smoothly at TSA as travelers prepared to spend the holiday in the sky.

""This is my third time traveling on Christmas Day and every time it's been like this. It's been alright"" Tommy Richardson of Fort Lauderdale said.

There are no hiccups with their flight but staff sick calls and exposure to COVID have led to flight cancellations and delays across the nation. More than 900 flights were cancelled Saturday nationwide after nearly 700 flights were cancelled on Christmas Eve.

At PHL the 34 delays and 15 cancellations are mostly American Airlines followed by a handful of Delta cancellations.

With these steps being taken concerns about omicron are minimal.

“I believe people will wear their mask and be vaccinated and keep their distance” said Debbie Cook.

But with the analysis based on number crunching we sometimes lose out on the greatness of some players. Greg Maddux is not one of them. The Hall of Famer has just as stellar a record on stat line as he does in reputation.

Greg Maddux’s Dominance

ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad

Maddux’s presence on the mound was intimidating enough on the Cubs but he really hit his peak at Truist Park. It was at the Braves that his name became an adjective.

Maddux describes a start in which a pitcher tosses a complete-game shutout on fewer than 100 pitches. And being named after the Hall of Famer there is no coincidence. Maddux is the only recorded player in the major leagues to repeat this feat 13 times. The next best pitcher has 7.

A short walk down memory lane also gives us insight into the player that gREG Maddux was. He was dominant in the Braves jersey. He won 4 consecutive Cy Young Awards from 1992 through 1995 and was one of the smartest operators from the mound. In a look back to yesteryear Maddux’s stat line looks like something of a dream.

And while there may be some detractors claiming that stats make books and skills make players. Maddux was no short of smarts on the diamond either. Fellow Hall of Famer Doug Glanville harkens back to when the two had faced off in the ballpark. Sharp as anyone else Maddux used to hurry Glanville whenever he led off leading to strike more often than not.

Maddux’s Career

Maddux started out pitching in the Chicago Cubs in 1986 but switched to the Atlanta Braves in 1992 where he enjoyed his most dominant stretch in the MLB. He was an all-star in 6 of the 11 seasons at Truist Park in between 1992 and 2003. Sprinkled with a few Cy Youngs in there for good measure.

He then switched back to the Cubs before a stint with the LA Dodgers and the San Diego Padres. However even after his retirement from the game as a player Maddux still was involved in the major leagues as an assistant coach and general manager both with the Chicago Cubs and the Texas Rangers.

If any doubts ever existed he was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in his first inclusion on the Ballot in 2014 with a 97.4% vote.

Maddux is a titan of the game and has been recognized as such several times before but who else can you think of whose stats stand upto their reputation in the league as well.

Krista Tyler instructional technology specialist at Grisham Middle School in the Round Rock Independent School District (ISD) read the poem at the Leander ISD school board meeting Dec. 16.

“Everyone in Leander liked reading a lot/ but some evangelicals in Leader did not” Tyler begins. “These kooks hated reading the whole reading season./ Please don’t ask why no one quite knows the reason./ It could be perhaps critical thinking causes fright./ It could be their heads aren’t screwed on just right./ But whatever the reason their brains or their fright/ they can’t follow policy in plain black and white.”

“These bigots don’t get to choose for us that’s clear” Tyler’s poem continues. “Then how I am wondering did we even get here./ They growl at our meetings all hawing and humming/ ‘We must stop this indoctrination from coming!’/ They’ve come for the books and the bonds and what for?/ Their kids don’t even attend Leander schools anymore./ Bring back our books maintain decorum good grief./ Wouldn’t it be nice to have a meeting in peace?”

“I’m disgusted and disheartened that there are teachers in our school district who think it is OK to mock parents for their religious beliefs and for demanding that children not have access to books in the library or classroom that have pornographic illustrations and graphic descriptions of sex acts” Dustin Clark a father of four children in Round Rock public schools who got arrested for speaking out in a school board meeting told Fox News.

Clark mentioned two of the books in question: “Lawn Boy” by Jonathan Evison which includes long sections of a boy reminiscing about explicit experiences he had at 10 years old; and “Gender Queer: A Memoir” by Maia Kobabe which includes photos of sexual acts between a boy and a man. Concerned parents have spoken up about these books and others in Leader and Round Rock as well as in other school districts such as Fairfax County Virginia.

Leander ISD pulled 11 books for sexual content earlier this month.

“The opinions of the teacher who recently spoke at the board meeting illustrate the utter disconnect some teachers have with their communities” Orlando Salinas a father of one child in Round Rock ISD and other children too young for public schools told Fox News. He said the teachers “are under the impression that parents are coming to these meetings in the spirit of political divisiveness when this is not the case.”

“Parents such as myself are increasingly participating in school board meetings because we see firsthand the detrimental effects that ‘woke-ism’ has had on our schools and our children” Salinas continued. “In Round Rock 8% of African American students and 11% of Hispanic students perform math on grade level according to the 2021 STARR Performance data. We parents are attending these meetings to challenge the status quo because the status quo is not working for our students.”

“Superintendents school board members and educators are spending an inordinate amount of time teaching children about what bathrooms to use and when it’s appropriate to lower their face masks and not enough time teaching our children reading writing and arithmetic” the father said.

Kieu Trang a mother of four children in Round Rock ISD at all three school levels said Krista Tyler “shouldn’t be teaching.”

“She is trying to lump all parents who oppose pornographic books into the ‘evangelicals-bigots-brainless’ category that hates reading but the fact of the matter is we are a group of very diverse highly-concerned parents who do not want pornographic books in our schools” Trang said. “The fact that that statement came from a teacher who could be teaching my children at Round Rock ISD is very concerning.”

“I might have opposing views but I don’t call anyone on the opposing side ‘bigots’ or brainless” Trang added. “That is reprehensible and despicable. She shouldn’t be teaching.”

Andy Hogue a father of two students in Leander ISD told Fox News that the State Board of Education approves curriculum but “every so often we find ourselves locked in these battles to stop certain liberal interests from going around our elected representatives. This time we want better representation over our district reading lists – and it’s a shame that we even have to debate this. But we are grateful that 11 of the objectionable books were removed.”

“This is not a matter of ‘banning books’ but one of community representation” Hogue added. “And as long as we’re paying taxes to the LISD we the people deserve to be heard.”

“That a classroom teacher – who by the way has the ability to prescribe ‘book club’ events and vacation reading activities – has such disdain for the very people who pay her salary is mind-boggling” Hogue said. “But it does paint a picture of the overall cluelessness we find ourselves up against.”

Before bedtime the Red Raiders had added one from a Big 12 rival.

Former Texas wide receiver Joshua Moore a Big 12 co-leader with nine touchdown catches in 2020 announced Thursday night he has committed to transfer to Tech. He went public with his plans hours after Erik Ezukanma the Red Raiders' receiving leader over the past three seasons declared for the NFL draft with two years of eligibility left.

Moore caught seven passes for 53 yards and a touchdown in 2018 redshirted in 2019 and caught 30 passes for 472 yards and nine TDs in 2020. This season he had 24 catches for 265 yards and one TD but he had his name entered into the NCAA transfer portal in early November days after he reportedly had a verbal altercation in practice with Texas coach Steve Sarkisian.

After Moore pledged to Tech Red Raiders quarterback Tyler Shough tweeted a photo of the two standing side by side. Moore will be a senior in 2022 then has an additional season of eligibility for 2023 for the extra year the NCAA granted all players after the COVID-disrupted 2020 season.

Moore listed by the Longhorns at 6-foot-1 and 169 pounds was a consensus national top-150 recruit coming out of Class 3A Yoakum where he helped his team reach a state-title game in 2016 and a state semi. He attracted scholarship offers from more than 50 programs including all four in this year's College Football Playoff as well as ones from Notre Dame Ohio State Oklahoma and Oregon.

The most impactful stretch of his career came at the beginning of the 2020 season which he started with a streak of five consecutive games with a touchdown catch.

He caught six passes for 127 yards and a TD in the season opener against Texas-El Paso then caught five passes for 73 yards and three TDs in the Longhorns' 63-56 overtime win against the Red Raiders. The first one against Tech covered 31 yards and then he caught an 18-yarder with 40 seconds left in the fourth quarter and a 12-yarder in overtime.

In the game after that he had eight catches for 83 yards and a TD against Oklahoma.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlLTEwMzQzMTgzL1RleGFzLXBhcmVudHMtb3V0cmFnZWQtdGVhY2hlci1yZWFkLURyLVNldXNzLXN0eWxlLXBvZW0tbW9ja2luZy1ldmFuZ2VsaWNhbHMtYmlnb3RzLmh0bWzSAY4BaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGFpbHltYWlsLmNvLnVrL25ld3MvYXJ0aWNsZS0xMDM0MzE4My9hbXAvVGV4YXMtcGFyZW50cy1vdXRyYWdlZC10ZWFjaGVyLXJlYWQtRHItU2V1c3Mtc3R5bGUtcG9lbS1tb2NraW5nLWV2YW5nZWxpY2Fscy1iaWdvdHMuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Texas parents outraged after teacher read Dr. Seuss-style poem mocking 'evangelicals' and 'bigots',"Parents in suburban Austin are outraged after a middle school teacher read a Dr. Seuss-inspired poem ridiculing 'evangelicals' and 'bigots' who want to ban books featuring sexual content they deemed pornographic.

Krista Tyler an instructional technology specialist at Grisham Middle School in Austin read her derisive rhymes during a school board meeting in the neighboring city of Leander on December 16.

'Everyone in Leander liked reading a lot/but some evangelicals in Leander did not' Tyler began in an exaggerated mocking tone.

The poem went on to call the parents backing book bans 'kooks' and 'bigots' who hate reading are fearful of critical thinking and do not have their heads 'screwed on just right.'

Tyler performed this poem during a December 16 school board meeting at Leander Independent School District

Tyler 40 closed with an appeal to 'bring back our books' and 'maintain decorum' at school board meetings.

DailyMail.com on Friday reached out to the teacher seeking comment on the strong reactions to her poem.

Earlier this month the Leander Independent School District removed 11 books from local school libraries after finding them to be pornographic and obscene including Lawn Boy by Jonathan Evison and Gender Queer by Maia Kobabe.

Gender Queer a graphic novel contains explicit illustrations of oral sex and masturbation involving a child and an adult. Lawn Boy contains graphic descriptions of sexual activity.

The books have sparked similar complaints in other states including Virginia where earlier this year the Fairfax County Independent School District briefly removed the two titles from school libraries.

But the books were reinstated after a review by a committee and administrators who determined the books 'were valuable in their potential to reach marginalized youth who may struggle to find relatable literary characters that reflect their personal journeys.'

“It’s a classic example of Art Deco architecture” Lenihan said. “I think it’ll be great to make a new use of it and keep its character.”

The building’s exterior features elongated arches tall rectangular facets and ornate metal decorations above the main doorway.

Hamilton City Council on Dec. 8 voted to pay the Community Improvement Corporation $300000 from the city’s general fund to make the purchase. The CIC is Hamilton’s agency created to promote economic development in the city. The sale price of the building was about $250000 but the building has a boiler that needed to replaced the reason for the additional $50000 advanced to the organization.

US Bank had an online auction to sell the building and the city was the winning bidder. City officials were hoping a developer would purchase it and create a new use for it. In recent years Hamilton city government has bought significant buildings particularly along the business corridor along High and Main Streets and sold them to developers at low costs in exchange for significant investments to return the properties to productive use.

Economic Development Specialist Stacey Dietrich Dudas has said the city likely will request from developers interested in reactivating the building. In exchange for the low price Hamilton likely would expect the developer to invest several million dollars in the project City Manager Joshua Smith recently told members of City Council.

Ally Bank Account Denial Class Action Lawsuit Overview:

Who: A woman who was brought to the United States as a child and is allowed to work under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program is suing Ally Bank.

Why: The woman says the bank denied her an account because she is not a U.S. citizen or legal permanent resident in violation of the law.

Where: The class action lawsuit was filed in a California federal court.

Ally Bank illegally denies non-United States residents access to bank accounts even if they are legally allowed to work in the country a new class action lawsuit alleges.

Plaintiff Mariela Aguilar Velazquez filed the class action complaint against Ally Bank Dec. 20 in a California federal court alleging violations of the Civil Rights Act and California Civil Code.

Aguilar is a recipient of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.

DACA is a policy that allows immigrants who were brought to the United States as children to receive a renewable two-year period of deferred action from deportation and become eligible for a work permit in the U.S.

Aguilar has had authorization to work in the United States and a Social Security Number since 2012. However in Nov. 2020 she says when she went to open a checking and savings account with Ally Bank she was unlawfully denied.

“Plaintiff Aguilar received a phone call from an Ally Bank representative informing Plaintiff Aguilar that she is ineligible to open a checking and savings account with Ally Bank because she is not a U.S. citizen or an Legal Permanent Resident” the lawsuit says. “Plaintiff Aguilar asked the representative whether this denial was allowed by law. The representative answered that it is Ally Bank’s policy to deny anyone who is not a U.S. citizen or permanent resident.”

Plaintiff Claims No Other Bank Denied Her An Account Because Of Immigration Status

Aguilar is alleging unlawful discrimination on the basis of alienage in violation of the Civil Rights Act and the Unruh Civil Rights Act as codified at California Civil Code. She said no other bank has denied her a bank account because of her immigration status.

“Plaintiff Aguilar suffered harm as a result of Ally Bank’s denial of her checking and savings account application because of her alienage” the lawsuit states. “Ally Bank’s denial of her application caused Plaintiff Aguilar to suffer emotional distress.”

She’s seeking to represent anyone in the United States who was denied a bank account from Ally Bank on the basis of alienage plus a California class.

She’s seeking certification of the class action an injunction damages fees costs and a jury trial.

In 2020 Wells Fargo agreed to pay a $20 million settlement to DACA recipients whose loan applications were denied by Wells Fargo.

But that might not mean much on Sunday.

Stafford is in his first season with the Los Angeles Rams (10-4) who take on the Vikings (7-7) at U.S. Bank Stadium. He had played the previous 12 seasons with the mostly woeful Detroit Lions and had a 74-90-1 overall record as a starter.

“I always thought he was a top-tier quarterback in this league’’ Vikings cornerback Patrick Peterson said on the podcast All Things Covered that he co-hosts with former NFL cornerback Bryant McFadden. “He just happened to play for the Detroit Lions.”

Stafford last was on a team that defeated the Vikings in October 2017. He then lost his next six meetings with them by an average margin of 11.3 points.

But Stafford’s situation got much better when he was traded last March to the Rams who have an abundance of talent. His wide receivers include Cooper Kupp who leads the NFL with 122 catches and 1625 receiving yards Odell Beckham Jr. a three-time Pro Bowl selection who is starting to regain his old form after some struggles in Cleveland and steady Van Jefferson.

“He’s obviously got more weapons’’ said Vikings coach Mike Zimmer.

At least the Vikings have plenty of familiarity with Stafford who has thrown for 4142 yards this season with 35 touchdown passes and 10 interceptions. The Vikings went against him two times a year with he was with Detroit a period Zimmer called “forever.’’ And Zimmer said his style of play this season has been “very similar.”

“He’s one of the toughest quarterbacks I think I’ve ever played’’ said Vikings co-defensive coordinator Adam Zimmer. “He takes a bunch of hits and keeps on getting back up. He gets back up and slings the ball. He’s got a great arm is very mobile in the pocket and I think he’s really thriving in this system.’’

When Stafford was with Detroit the Vikings had plenty of success in sacking him. They dumped him a team-record 10 times in a 2018 game and six other times sacked him five or more times.

But that was against the Lions’ offensive line and when he had their receivers. Much has changed since then.

“He finally has a solid team around him that can help him win and not just put everything on his shoulders and he can just go out there and play … stress-free football’’ Peterson told reporters.

On Sunday it will be seen how much stress Peterson has. He was asked on the podcast about covering Kupp.

“They move him everywhere’’ Peterson responded. “You pray. You literally pray because he can find the holes in the zones.”

RAMSEY’S RESPONSE

Vikings star wide receiver Justin Jefferson said he has “circled” on his calendar his first matchup against Rams star cornerback Jalen Ramsey and that he considers it a “statement game.”

Ramsey responded to what Jefferson said.

“I saw it. … He wants to be an extreme competitor’’ Ramsey said. “He wants to prove that he’s one of the best in the league and he’s trying to get my respect calling me one of the best in the league. But we all know how these matchups go. Sometimes you get ‘em sometimes you don’t. I live for them as well. … I haven’t had this day circled. … I try to play every game the same.”

Nevertheless Ramsey has plenty of appreciation for Jefferson.

“He is a heck of a football player and regardless of our matchup he’s already one of the best in the league’’ Ramsey said. “I do have a lot of respect for him but we’re going to get after it for sure.”

ROSTER UPDATES

The Vikings did not elevate fullback Jake Bargas from the practice squad on Saturday making it likely that fullback C.J. Ham listed as questionable with a hamstring injury will play against the Rams. Wide receiver Adam Thielen who has missed the past two games with left high ankle sprain also was listed as questionable and he is likely to return against the Rams.

The Rams will be without starting left tackle Andrew Whitworth who was placed Saturday on the COVID-19 reserve list. The Rams brought up wide receiver Brandon Powell and defensive back Grant Haley from the practice squad and activated running back Buddy Howell off injured reserve for possible use against the Vikings.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZS1zdW4uY29tL21vbmV5LzQyODY5OTgvYXJlLWJhbmtzLW9wZW4tdG9kYXktbmV3LXllYXJzLWZvci1jaGFzZS_SAVNodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGUtc3VuLmNvbS9tb25leS80Mjg2OTk4L2FyZS1iYW5rcy1vcGVuLXRvZGF5LW5ldy15ZWFycy1mb3ItY2hhc2UvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Are banks open today?

He's a ride-share driver for Uber but pretty soon after the woman got into his backseat things went awry.

Geary picked up the woman at an assisted living facility in Trinity and then began following his Uber GPS directions to her destination.

A couple of minutes into the 15-minute ride the woman told him to go a different way.

""I said ‘That’s not the direction that Uber has on the GPS’"" Geary recalled for FOX 13 News' Justin Matthews. ""She says ‘I don’t care what the direction is that’s where I want you to take me’ and I said ‘Ma’am if I’m taking you to a different location I need you to update this in the app.’ Geary said.

Pasco deputies released images of Geary Wednesday in an effort to locate him

Geary says he stayed on course but the woman became agitated and raised her voice.

""She says ‘Let me out stop stop the vehicle!’ She’s yelling she’s trying to pull on my handle as the car is in motion to get out of the vehicle"" said Geary. ""I said ‘Ma’am relax. Once I stop I will terminate the ride and you can get out of the vehicle.’""

PREVIOUS: Pasco sheriff: Uber driver located cooperating after suspected kidnapping

After finding a safe place to stop Geary says the woman threatened to call the police as she got out of the car.

Geary said the situation was strange but he didn't give it much more thought. He terminated the ride in his Uber app and continued along his day taking three more rides.

But that afternoon Uber suddenly suspended his account. Geary had no choice but to call it a day.

He was at home around 3:30 p.m. when his girlfriend called.

""She says ‘What are you doing?’ I said ‘I just finished cleaning the windows.’ She says ‘I’m shaking right now.’ I said ‘What’s wrong?’ She says ‘You’re wanted by the Pasco County Sheriff’s Department.'""

Geary's face and a picture of his vehicle were all over the news after a 911 caller reported a suspicious incident possibly a kidnapping.

The Pasco County Sheriff’s Office says dispatch received a 911 call just after 7 Wednesday morning from a woman who said she got into an Uber driver's car and noticed a third person hiding under a blanket in the backseat.

The woman told investigators that the person under the blanket engaged her in a physical altercation before she was able to get out of the car.

Geary let her out at a retail complex near Little Road and Trinity Blvd. That’s where Geary says she threatened to call the cops before he terminated the ride and drove away.

He maintains there was no one else in the car – and there was no physical altercation.

""It bothers me that somebody’s word can destroy your life somebody’s statements can really have an impact on you whether they’re true or not"" said Geary.

PCSO eventually located him questioned him and collected evidence. A spokesperson for the agency said Thursday this case is an ongoing investigation.

No arrests have been made.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy53dHNwLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvcGFzY29jb3VudHkvcGFzY28tdWJlci1kcml2ZXIta2lkbmFwcGluZy1zdXNwZWN0LzY3LWNmYWYxZTg1LTg3OTgtNDlmOS04M2UxLTM5YzM4YmJmMDNhZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pasco Uber driver says rider made up story about kidnapping,"""I think people should know that they can't get away with making false statements"" John Geary says.

PASCO COUNTY Fla. — After having authorities called on him for what law enforcement initially described as a suspected kidnapping Pasco County Uber driver John Geary says there was never a kidnapping at all.

He says he wants the truth out there.

On Wednesday Geary planned to spend his day working for Uber. But when his first passenger got in his car he says that’s when the issues began.

“I said the GPS is telling me another direction. She immediately told me go my way go to the directions I’m giving you and I told her she needs to update those directions in the Uber app” Geary explained.

He says he then continued with the GPS’ instructions instead of following his passenger’s instructions.

Well Geary says that was enough to set the passenger off. He says she wanted to get out of the car so he pulled to a safe location to let her out. He adds the passenger was trying to get out of his car while he was still driving.

“Once I identified a safe location to drop the passenger off I came to a complete stop. My door locks opened up my child safety locks opened up. She aggressively grabs the handle the handle slips from her hand she grabs it for a second time and kicks my door open” Geary said.

Geary says there’s a scuff on his door from when she got out.

“So she got out of the vehicle left the passenger side rear door open. I then unlock my seatbelt got out of my vehicle to shut the door.”

That’s when Geary says the passenger was yelling that she would call the police.

“I told her great call the cops I just ended the trip” Geary said.

Geary says he went about his day making several more trips before he received a call from his girlfriend saying he was wanted by the Pasco County Sheriff’s Office.

Deputies said the passenger reported a physical altercation with somebody found hidden under a blanket in the backseat of the car.

However Geary says none of that is true. He even gets into the backseat to show just how small the space is.

“Really would you get in an Uber ride with somebody who had a blanket over them?

“I want the truth out there; I want the true story out there of what took place. I think people should know that they can’t get away with making false statements” Geary said.

He adds the investigation has prevented him from working for Uber. As of right now Geary says his Uber account is terminated pending the investigation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlemVlbi5jb20vMjAyMS8xMi8yNC91YmVyLWFycml2YWwtZWxlY3RyaWMtY2FyLXJpZGUtaGFpbGluZy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"Uber and Arrival design ""super minimal"" electric car for ride-hailing industry","Electric vehicle brand Arrival has revealed the prototype of its monovolume electric car designed for Uber which aims to offer passengers a comfort-driven ride-hailing experience.

Intended for urban environments where ride-hailing is most popular the Arrival Car features a one-box-style design with a squared back-end that smoothly tapers towards the front. Its form was described by Arrival as ""super minimal"".

The design team elevated and moved the driver's seat as far forward as possible to grant optimum visibility which is enhanced by the large size of the windscreen.

The passenger seating area at the back of the car offers twice as much leg-room as that of an average car of the same length more than in a Rolls Royce according to the company.

""The overall footprint of the whole car is the same as the Volkswagen Golf"" said Arrival's Tom Elvidge.

""But as you can see one of the big design features that we've really strived for is in the back of the car [which] is massive.""

The singular front passenger seat can be folded down and moved forward underneath the dashboard to further open up the interior and back row.

Additionally the boot is designed to hold two large suitcases and several small bags.

In a bid to make the dashboard as stripped-back as possible all the car's additional features such as navigation bluetooth phone connection and temperature-control settings can all be monitored via a simple touchscreen display.

When riders start their trip the name and photograph of both the driver and passenger can be shown offering a ""moment for connection"".

The car was developed in just over six months by way of ""vertical integration-utilising technologies"" which saw the team have a hand in all parts of the design process.

It forms part of Arrival and Uber's plan to create an electric fleet of cars that can be used for ride-hailing.

""Electrifying ride-hailing will play a crucial role in reducing the emissions of vehicles in cities globally providing a sustainable clean multi-modal transportation system for communities"" said Elvidge.

""We are keen on supporting drivers with this transition by developing the best possible product for ride-hailing that elevates the experience for both them and their passengers making urban air clean in the process.""

A prototype of the car was unveiled on 16 December 2021 and will be tested at the start of 2022 to provide feedback for a further design phase before going into production.

Arrival previously launched a zero-emissions bus aimed at making public transport feel safer during the pandemic. The vehicle includes features such as a zero-touch bell removable seats and seamless easy-to-clean surfaces.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzEyLzI0L3ViZXItZHJpdmVyLWRhd2VkLW1la29uZW5lLWFjY3VzZWQtb2Ytc2V4dWFsbHktYXNzYXVsdGluZy1wYXNzZW5nZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Uber driver Dawed Mekonene accused of sexually assaulting passenger,"An Uber driver in Las Vegas sexually assaulted a woman who fell asleep in his car police said.

Dawed Mekonene 30 was arrested Monday on sexually motivated kidnapping charges and other counts after the female victim told police she awoke to find him attacking her in his green Toyota Camry during a ride on Dec. 16 Las Vegas police said.

“After the assault the victim was driven to the originally requested destination” cops said in a statement Tuesday announcing Mekonene’s arrest.

In addition to the kidnapping charge Mekonene was booked into jail on two counts of sexual assault and battery by strangulation with intent to commit sexual assault police said.

Logs provided to police by Uber show Mekonene canceled the 6-mile ride from the Las Vegas Strip to an apartment complex while in progress – and then restarted it 22 minutes later while dropping the woman off the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported.

Mekonene tried to “deflect” when detectives later grilled him about the time gap and his leg “started to shake very fast” according to an arrest report.

Mekonene then asked for a lawyer before refusing to answer additional questions. It’s unclear if he’s hired an attorney who could speak on his behalf and court logs do not indicate he’s hired one the Review-Journal reported.

The victim an out-of-state visitor told cops she dozed off minutes into the ride and awoke to find Mekonene sexually assaulting her. He ignored the woman’s pleas to stop and strangled her until she was unconscious the arrest report shows.

Mekonene then took the woman to her destination and pulled her out of the car before tossing her clothes and belongings at her she told police.

Logs provided to police by Uber show Dawed Mekonene canceled the 6-mile ride from the Las Vegas Strip to an apartment complex while the ride was in progress. LVMPD

Prosecutors are declining to pursue the kidnapping charge court logs cited by the Review-Journal show. Mekonene whose bail was set at $200000 is due back in court on Dec. 30. He remained in custody early Friday online records show.

Mekonene told cops he had driven for Uber and Lyft for six months. He has been removed from the former ride-sharing platform the company told the Review-Journal.

“The details described by the ride are horrific and we immediately deactivated the driver” an Uber spokesperson told the newspaper. “We are working with law enforcement on their investigation.”

“Mr. Mekonene no longer has access to the Lyft platform — we permanently removed him when we learned of this incident” a Lyft spokesperson told The Post.

Cops urged anyone with information about Mekonene to contact investigators at (702) 828-3421."

My teens were the acne-fighting years; my 20s the great glow quest; and my 30s are all about neck and décolleté skin care. Yes with things like tech neck sun spots and collagen loss rearing their ugly heads I’ve waged a beauty battle so to speak enlisting all manner of skin care specifically designed for the sub-chin region.

The thing is despite all the products out there the neck and chest are still way too often overlooked and typically neglected until the 11th hour. A shame since many say it’s more susceptible to signs of premature aging due to the delicacy of the skin in that area. Sun damage crepiness and collagen breakdown are all common symptoms of neglected necks and décolletés. And I don’t remember ordering any of these things.

“On the neck the skin starts to crepe and not just because the skin starts to thin out [as we age] but because our facial muscles start to sag and out neck is holding everything up” says Tera Valdez esthetician and co-founder of microcurrent skin care company NuFace in a recent Instagram Live post. “So naturally when those muscles start to sag everything [beneath it] starts to loosen.”

Yikes. For this reason I’m on a constant quest to defy gravity and keep the area taught and smooth as can be. Over the years I’ve developed a nice arsenal of tools creams serums and masks for the space below my jawline — and I make sure to carve out a few extra minutes each day to ensure the region gets just as much love as my face.

Because the skin is so delicate and prone to dryness I’ve learned that rich hydrating formulas are the best way to go so I opt for products with buzzy ingredients like hyaluronic acid antioxidants and peptides. In a Jan 2021 article on neck care products board-certified dermatologist Dr. Ava Shamban told TZR that the neck has thinner skin and fewer oil glands than the face making skin-protective ingredients like ceramides and peptides crucial.

Also just like the contours of the face tools and devices can (and should) be employed for the neck and chest area to keep the skin firm and lifted. I’ve long sung the praises of microcurrent wonder the NuFace Trinity for the face and I’m happy to report it also works its sculpting and tightening magic on my neck and décoletté.

While many stores had extended hours in the days leading up to Christmas Eve the majority will close early Friday.

For the second holiday shopping season of the pandemic retailers started rolling out deals early to spread out demand. This year consumers were encouraged to also start early because of supply chain constraints.

Those ongoing constraints might be one reason more people will shop in-stores or take advantage of curbside pickup or on-demand delivery.

More people are also off from work. While Christmas Eve is not a federal holiday many businesses and federal offices are recognizing it as a day off because Christmas falls on a Saturday. The stock market is closed Friday.

The portents were ominous. In October 1973 his vice president Spiro Agnew had resigned amid a corruption scandal. A week later Arab oil-exporting countries had declared an embargo on the United States. Three days later Nixon had fired the Watergate special prosecutor prompting his attorney general and deputy attorney general to resign in protest in what became known instantly as the Saturday Night Massacre. And just days earlier a Senate committee had subpoenaed his taped conversations as part of the Watergate investigations.

Nixon scrawled his grim conclusion on a notepad: “Last Christmas here?”

It was. Two hundred and twenty nine days later Nixon boarded a military helicopter to leave the executive mansion for the last time as president.

But in the short term he would make a little presidential trivia by flying to his California mansion for a vacation—but going by commercial airline rather than Air Force One.

As the federal nonpartisan Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum once noted on Twitter United Airlines Flight 55 from Dulles to Los Angeles on Dec. 26 1973 marks the only time a sitting president has flown a public commercially scheduled flight. This trip seems self-evidently important in a “dad history” way (it’s even been trotted out in a Tom Clancy-brand novel).

Nixon’s stunt was sold to the press as an environmental move a gesture of responsibility in energy-conscious times. It entered the history books as trivia.

But in reality it was the flight of a defeated man—one who had already half given up on the presidency he had fought tooth-and-nail to win and one of the most powerful symbols of his office with it. Exploring this trip and why it was misremembered and misreported reveals a lot about how preconceptions can lead analysts to miss what’s really happening.

President Richard Nixon and his foreign policy team including Henry Kissinger fly to China aboard Air Force One on Feb. 20 1972.

Heads of state first took to the skies in the middle of the 20th century and made their aircraft symbols of their administration. U.S. President John F. Kennedy worked with his wife and a celebrity designer to transform a utilitarian orange and white design into the familiar blue and white scheme now synonymous with presidential travel.

The two Boeing 707s with the call sign Air Force One didn’t just get new paint jobs. Descriptions of these presidential aircraft routinely mention their role as a military communications hub—a reminder of the executive power to launch Armageddon.

So why then would Nixon make a show of giving up these planes and their penumbra of power at one of the low points in his presidency?

The year 1973 had begun with an administration optimistic that it could build on Nixon’s landslide 1972 reelection to rack up a lasting legacy. There was an early success: a formal end to U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War.

Yet Watergate had curdled everything. In May White House Chief of Staff Bob Haldeman and others were forced to resign for their roles in Watergate. The Senate Watergate Committee publicized the scandal in televised hearings. At the same time the energy crisis caused daily wrenching economic pain for Americans. Nixon’s approval ratings collapsed.

Not everyone had a bad year. Nixon’s foreign policy maven Henry Kissinger had enjoyed a triumphant one. Watergate made Kissinger the quotable successful front man for foreign policy. He won the mother of all bureaucratic turf battles by taking on the role of secretary of state while keeping his post as national security adviser. He also won a Nobel Peace Prize as lagniappe.

Yet the political climate of the energy crisis crimped even Kissinger’s style. On Christmas Eve the Mexican foreign minister telephoned him to pin down Kissinger’s plans for a visit. “Can I call you say after Christmas?” Kissinger dodged. “One problem is how to get down there because I don’t like to travel in a military plane right now with the energy crisis you see.”

Nixon faced similar constraints in his planning to get out of Washington. On Dec. 24 Nixon decided that he would go to his “Western White House” a mansion in coastal Orange County California that he called La Casa Pacifica. (The house paid for through opaque sources and upgraded at federal expense was the center of a Watergate sub-scandal.) He had his military aide make the reservations for the party of 25 family members staff and Secret Service agents at a total cost of $4841 (about $30000 today).

Nixon kept the plans secret even from his staff. He kept a normal schedule on Dec. 26 taking meetings with Kissinger Soviet Ambassador to the United States Anatoly Dobrynin his energy czar William Simon and former New York state governor Nelson Rockefeller. Then at 4:20 that afternoon he was driven to Dulles International Airport with his wife Pat and his daughter Tricia.

Kissinger learned about the trip late on the afternoon of Dec. 26 even though he had spoken to the president an hour before he departed. “I wondered if I had lost my mind” he told White House Chief of Staff Gen. Alexander Haig in a call about the trip minutes before the flight took off.

“He didn’t tell you?” Haig replied. “He was ashamed to.”

“Well” Kissinger said “he should be.”

The presidential party arrived at Dulles about an hour after leaving the White House. Skipping the airport’s mobile lounges the motorcade drove straight to the DC-10 jetliner where Nixon walked to seat 2A. His dog an Irish setter named King Timahoe flew in the baggage compartment.

Rain and baggage problems delayed takeoff for 45 minutes but the flight was otherwise uneventful. The president ate the inflight dinner (ribeye beef) watched part of a movie (From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler starring Ingrid Bergman) and napped. Most passengers didn’t even realize that the president was onboard until midway through the flight when Nixon walked through the plane shaking hands and signing autographs and as one stewardess told the Los Angeles Times “surprising the life out of them.”

The airliner landed at Los Angeles International Airport at 8:02 p.m. Pacific Time. A motorcade met the plane and the president and his family were driven to San Clemente. Bewildered passengers left afterward met by reporters eager to interview them about their unexpected encounter.

When modern presidents travel the media follows them at the very least in the form of a press pool through which reporters share daily coverage of presidents. Nixon’s flight broke this rule. The White House only informed a pair of reporters about the trip an hour before the flight took off.

Tom Brokaw then a weekend anchor for NBC’s Today Show wrote in a later memoir that he was disturbed by the trip because of potential risks to the president’s safety. Professional self-interest also colored his views: Without press coverage Brokaw wrote how would the public learn the truth if something awful did take place? Brokaw bought a red-eye ticket and followed the president westward.

A New York Times page from Dec. 28 1973 details Nixon's commercial flight.

The news broke on Dec. 27 with the morning newspapers. The White House maintained that the trip had been undertaken to save fuel. “He just decided to go to California and thought that he could as president take many steps to set an example in the field of energy” Deputy Press Secretary Gerald Warren told the New York Times.

Newspapers echoed the talking point. The Chicago Tribune reported that the usual assortment of presidential helicopters and airplanes for such a trip would have cost almost twice as much in fuel costs alone. The Los Angeles Times headlined its above-the-fold account “Nixon Saves Fuel.” Nor was the coverage limited to major papers: the Cedar Rapids Gazette ran the Associated Press coverage on its front page reporting an even more favorable estimate of fuel savings.

The coverage was not all favorable. The New York Times raised concerns that the United flight lacked the communications technology needed. (White House officials said the president had brought along the necessary equipment.) The Associated Press reported that Federal Aviation Administration agency head Alexander Butterfield “first learned of the trip as the airliner carrying the presidential party was taxiing out for takeoff.” Butterfield said he was “dismayed” that the president had kept his plans secret. (Earlier that year Butterfield a former White House deputy chief of staff had revealed the existence of the White House taping system to Senate investigators.) The White House responded that security required secrecy about the president’s movements.

Still the press coverage showed Nixon as something closer to a gladhanding politician than a criminal mastermind—a welcome change under the circumstances.

“You are on the front of the Times and the Post walking in the plane” Kissinger told Nixon when they spoke by phone the next day.

“Good or bad?” Nixon asked.

“Good” Kissinger said. “I am surprised. I expected them to say bad but they all say terrific.”

Kissinger perhaps hurt to be left out of the secret voiced his displeasure. “I did not think the President of the U.S. should fly commercially” he said. “I am surprised at it all.”

Nixon explained that he had not told his secretary of state “deliberately” so Kissinger didn’t have to lie for anyone.

“You have to [lie] enough for a good reason” he said. “This would have been for a bad reason.”

Nixon invited Kissinger to join him in California and concluded by instructing Kissinger to lie to the press about their conversation. “I think you should say you talked with the president today for a half hour” Nixon said. White House records show the call lasted only six minutes.

Never sociable the president retreated into his shell even further during his stay in San Clemente doing literally almost nothing. On Jan. 2 1974 in a typical passage for this period his calendar shows only two entries: “9:45: The President went to his office” and “2:00: The President departed his office.” The following day he spoke with Kissinger for three minutes—and with Ohio State University football coach Woody Hayes for four. The most consequential meeting he took was an hourlong interview with lawyer James D. St. Clair whom Nixon hired as his defense attorney on Watergate—and impeachment—issues.

On Jan. 9 his staff presented him with a “surprise” birthday party that began at 10:30 a.m. sharp and ended at 11 a.m. exactly. In possibly the only unscripted moment Nixon invited King Timahoe to lick the cake—before it was served.

Later that day Nixon his wife and his daughter drove to Sunnylands the Palm Springs home of the then-U.S. ambassador to the United Kingdom Walter Annenberg. En route the presidential party stopped at a McDonald’s in the small town of Banning. They ate in the limousine—possibly the most pathetic presidential birthday meal in history.

The Nixons stayed at Sunnylands for two days. On Jan. 12 Nixon his wife and his daughter boarded a presidential Lockheed JetStar at the Palm Springs Municipal Airport. With the president aboard the smaller plane which sat only eight nevertheless bore the callsign Air Force One. The plane arrived at Andrews Air Force Base the following morning.

The media was eager to find symbolism in the presidential flight whether in approachability or environmental responsibility. Even their objections to the flight were framed in terms of security and transparency.

But the trip was a symptom of a presidency that had all but collapsed already—and a president who was barely bothering to play the part at all.

There’s evidence that Nixon psychologically quit the presidency long before he resigned. One systematic study of Nixon’s presidency establishes that Nixon disengaged from the presidency on Dec. 6 1973 when Gerald Ford was confirmed by Congress as his vice president and heir apparent. After that Nixon met with his top officials for only 15 percent of the time he had during his first term an average of just two meetings a day. His public schedule by contrast showed no decline in activity—a president keeping up appearances.

That duality persisted even while Nixon languished in San Clemente. In a latter-day version of The King’s Two Bodies Nixon may have done nothing but the president continued to act signing major legislation creating health maintenance organizations reorganizing the country’s railroads establishing the nationwide 55 mile per hour speed limit and protecting endangered species.

Ironically the mythos of the presidency probably made the collapse harder to discern in real time. The image of presidential power that the White House likes to project is matched by an image of superhuman competence and discipline. Even scholarly theories of presidential behavior often begin by assuming that presidents will allocate their effort optimally.

And yet even competent and stable presidents spend their time making small decisions as well as big ones. They indulge petty whims and private vendettas. They disengage from the job—some more than others. Gossip columnists and presidential fanboys exaggerate the importance of such presidential peccadilloes. Yet self-consciously serious analysts are too ready to dismiss those seemingly irrational behaviors as unimportant leaving them to see the world through theories that deny the possibility of the unexpected.

Both fallacies shape how Nixon’s trip continues to be perceived. Yet even at the time the White House stories about Nixon’s flight made no sense. If secrecy was required for security then putting him on a commercial flight with a known arrival time and place was self-defeating. If saving fuel was the objective taking the smaller Jetstar he returned in rather than the Boeing 707 would have sufficed—or he could have just gone to Camp David instead.

Public statements by the White House proved just persuasive enough to distract from the plain fact that the president was making irrational decisions—to cover up in other words the fact that the president had stopped functioning. It seems far more likely that Nixon in a funk about his impending political demise fled to lick his wounds in isolation—and give a kick to the press along the way.

Those weren’t the acts of a healthy stable person much less a well-adjusted chief executive. Even when Nixon’s private dysfunction mostly kept hidden by a protective staff broke out into the open as he boarded the United jet the impact of the mad king’s flight still did not shake comfortable beliefs that he was acting more or less like a normal publicity-obsessed politician.

Despite his erratic behavior Nixon occupied the most powerful office in the world for months afterward. The political system found it easier to deny that exceptional events were taking place than to take the steps necessary to fix the problem at the root. It would not be the last time.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzEyLzI0L2ltLWEtZmxpZ2h0LWF0dGVuZGFudC1hbmQtaS1nb3QtZmlyZWQtZm9yLXNoYXJpbmctc2VjcmV0cy1vZi1teS1qb2Itb24tc29jaWFsLW1lZGlhL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,I'm a flight attendant and I got fired for sharing secrets of my job on social media,"Arina Bloom used to post videos on Tiktok telling her viewers about her work as a flight attendant for United Airlines.

She had posted roughly 20 videos where she wore her uniform and shared industry secrets for example that the airline doesn’t clean the plane in between flights.

However in a recent video she shared the news that she was fired from her job after someone made an anonymous complaint about her.

She followed that up with a second video revealing that she wasn’t given a warning and was forced to resign immediately.

She said: “I was recently forced to resign from my job because of this Tiktok page.

“My airline was pretty much aware of my social media platform they even commented on my video back in August so it’s not like I was hiding something.

“But all of a sudden in December it became a problem.

“I got in trouble for every single video where I appeared in my uniform which I do understand – every airline has their own rules.

“Although I do feel guilty over some of my content and I promise that I will never do it again I really think that overall my page was positive and I was just showing how happy I am to be a part of this airline.

“I personally think I was a great free advertisement truly tried to inspire others to join [the] aviation industry.”

Between them the two videos have been watched more than 200000 times and viewers have turned out in their thousands to show support for Arina.

One person wrote: “United Airlines you really dropped the ball on this! She really showed lots of people the wonders of working in aviation.”

Arina Bloom said that the airline that she worked for forced her to resign after someone complained about her. TikTok

Someone else put: “That page was the reason for me to apply for this job.

“She is gorgeous and good ad for the company. Really bad decision to cancel her.”

Arina’s story has also been shared on Reddit where users were less sympathetic.

One person commented: “In my opinion this should be common sense. If you’re going to do videos for whatever reason keep your private employment out of it.”

Another wrote: “Is the person that got her fired an a**hole? Yes. Is she foolish for having herself in uniform on her Tiktok? Also yes.”

A third simply wrote: “No sympathy.”

Thankfully she revealed she has interviews for other airlines already sharing videos of her interview tips and advice.

Here's how Christmas Eve flights may be impacted,"More than 100 Delta and United flights have been canceled on Christmas Eve due to the rise in omicron cases the airlines announced Thursday.

So far Delta Airlines has canceled around 90 flights intended to depart on Dec. 24 while United Airlines has canceled nearly 120 flights.

“The nationwide spike in Omicron cases this week has had a direct impact on our flight crews and the people who run our operation” a United Airlines representative said in an email Thursday night. “As a result we’ve unfortunately had to cancel some flights and are notifying impacted customers in advance of them coming to the airport. We’re sorry for the disruption and are working hard to rebook as many people as possible and get them on their way for the holidays.”

Delta and United have announced more than 200 cancellations due mostly to COVID related staffing issues.



It comes as the omicron variant is rapidly spreading nationwide.

The same day a Delta Airlines representative issued the following statement to News 6:

“Delta teams have exhausted all options and resources—including rerouting and substitutions of aircraft and crews to cover scheduled flying—before canceling around 90 flights for Friday. We apologize to our customers for the delay in their holiday travel plans. Delta people are working hard to get them to where they need to be as quickly and as safely as possible on the next available flight.”

German airline Lufthansa also canceled a dozen transatlantic flights over the holiday period because of a massive rise in pilots taking sick leave.

At Orlando International Airport a handful of flights have been disrupted so far. The airport is expecting nearly 130000 passengers for Christmas Eve alone. It’s actually one of the lighter holiday travel days.

HOLIDAY TRAVEL: Wait is about 34-38 minutes. I doubt that includes the 25 minutes it took to even get to normal security lines. I’d say give yourself at least an hour to get through security alone. @news6wkmg pic.twitter.com/7btxK9cx1x — Nadeen Yanes (@NadeenNews6) December 24 2021

Earlier this month airport officials said more than 2.6 million passengers are expected to travel through the gates during their 19-day travel period which runs from Dec. 17-Jan. 4.

Cancellations have the potential to snowball as the days get busier.

If you’re heading to MCO be sure to give yourself extra time and check your flight status through the Greater Orlando Aviation Authority website.

On Christmas Eve 1.7 million people were screened at airport checkpoints according to TSA figures. The day before 2.2 million were.

That’s a 166 percent increase over the same two days in 2020 when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urged Americans not to fly on account of that winter’s COVID-19 surge.

This year officials have only asked that Americans be “prudent” with their travel plans in the face of the Omicron variant.

The two-day total is 76 percent of air travel volume for those days in 2019 the numbers show.

The new variant’s late-December surge has coincided with hundreds of flight cancellations with United Airlines blaming staffing shortages stemming from the spike. “The nationwide spike in Omicron cases this week has had a direct impact on our flight crews and the people who run our operation” a rep for the carrier said.",,,

Officers from Covina Police Department responded to the call and took into custody Trevor Howard Thompson 34 after a 4-hour stand-off with officers. Authorities indicated a semi-automatic weapon was confiscated at the scene that was used in the shooting.

The stand-off began at 4:15 p.m. in the 5100 block of Bonnie Clove Avenue. Thompson was in hiding in an outdoor patio area of a nearby apartment complex when he attempted to evade police. Officers fired their weapons and were able to apprehend the suspect.

Teamsters Local 396 posted a message and condolences on Facebook to the family.

“Our Teamster Brother Pasadena Center Driver [UPS]Joey Casias was tragically murdered last night when he heroically tried to help apprehend a neighborhood burglar last night. Joey was the guy that would give you the shirt off his back. He was the guy that would give his last dollar to you if you needed it. He was the kind of guy the world needed more of. Joey was loved and well respected by all who knew him. A hard-working union man who was always there ready to help his friends and family.”

Unique identifiers have been billed as a way to reduce clinical mix-ups and improve patient safety and data sharing while fortifying a patchwork medical privacy system. The United States is an outlier among developed countries in not having a universal patient identifier experts say.

But the current push comes amid a pandemic that’s spawned heated debates over matters like vaccine passports and other digital credentials that touch on privacy and equity issues.

The most prominent defender of the funding ban is Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) whose father former Rep. Ron Paul devised the language that was inserted in annual spending bills. Opponents like Paul fear a patient identifier could infringe on privacy and allow the government to track a person’s medical history — concerns similar to those the ACLU has articulated.

Senate Democratic appropriators stripped the ban from a spending bill this fall saying it had been a barrier for health institutions reliably sharing patient information and for public health entities tracing contacts and tracking immunizations during the Covid-19 pandemic. Paul responded with legislation (S. 3124 (117)) aimed at removing HHS’ authority to develop health identifiers. Texas Republican Rep. Chip Roy introduced a House version H.R. 5812 (117) raising concerns about surveillance and profiling of patients.

The fate of the ID system will likely be determined in February when a stopgap spending measure H.R. 6119 (117) is set to expire.

Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) a physician who supports the patient ID argued that an identifier could improve privacy by ending the need to rely on Social Security numbers which if compromised could leave both financial and medical data vulnerable.

“I respect that Rand is concerned about privacy. I just think he has it all wrong” Cassidy said.

Outside experts say the privacy concerns are less of an issue than Paul and others argue.

David Bates a professor of health policy at Harvard’s public health school and a professor of medicine said Paul’s concerns aren’t legitimate and only reflect a “highly vocal minority” of the population.

Kirk Nahra a leading privacy lawyer at WilmerHale said a national identifier would likely bring significant benefits with manageable privacy risks though that is still not yet settled.

That’s where the HHS health IT report comes in.

“We’d love to see them make a recommendation that [the ban] be eliminated” said Mari Savickis vice president of public policy at the College of Healthcare Information Management Executives. “Is that going to happen? That’s the million-dollar question.”

Backers of the system say the pandemic underscored the country’s outdated public health infrastructure which hampered its Covid-19 response. The holes included poor data sharing which the advocates say patient identifiers could help patch by allowing information like positive test results to flow more freely allowing for a quicker response.

Many of the key technical details of what a patient identifier would actually look like have yet to be resolved including what entity manages and assigns the identifiers said Shaun Grannis vice president of data and analytics at the Regenstrief Institute a research organization. Medicare already uses a beneficiary identifier that consists of a string of letters and numbers.

Grannis and other experts say the issue touches on social political and economic fault lines though it’s wrapped in technology.

“There’s so much friction in moving health information today in our system. This would move a piece of that friction” said Julia Adler-Milstein the director of the Center for Clinical Informatics and Improvement Research and professor of medicine at the University of California San Francisco.

Dozens of influential health care organizations have banded together to form the Patient ID Now coalition including Intermountain Healthcare the American Heart Association the American Health Information Management Association and the American College of Surgeons. Foster argues that since the language removing the ban is in the text momentum is on his side.

But despite the push not everyone’s optimistic that the ban will be repealed.

“It’s a really tough uphill battle” Savickis said. “But [the report] is something Congress asked for and so [the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology] needs to deliver it so we can move forward.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vdG50cmlidW5lLmNvbS9kY3MtbmVlZHMtYS1tYWpvci1vdmVyaGF1bC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,DCS Needs a Major Overhaul,"For several years running the Tennessee Department of Children’s Services placed more children in foster care than kids it returned to their families. In 2014-15 3078 children of 8093 in 2015-16 2895 of 8001 and in 2016-17 1365 of 14421 children returned home. We asked for more recent data but did not hear back from DCS by press time.

Former Commissioner Jim Henry (2013-2015) supported a number of reform initiatives like In-Home Tennessee to improve how the child welfare system works with families. He promoted and found money for Community Advisory Boards and community-based child abuse prevention.

In 2014 Henry signed 42 contracts with 25 community-based agencies that provided support services to 3200 children. Henry had the right idea: keep children out of the system by providing families with services at home.

Those efforts started to pay off. The number of children taken into DCS custody in 2013 was 8426. In 2014 it was 8008. In Commissioner Bonnie Hommrich’s first year as DCS Commissioner (2015) the numbers dropped again to 7856. (See https://tntribune.com/how-child-welfare-was-fixed/ )

But during the Haslam administration DCS moved away from reforms like advisory boards and instead built a formidable custody apparatus with federal and state funds.

The department operates like the mafia; it has tentacles everywhere. Judges are afraid of it; hospitals are too; police departments do their bidding. Parents are terrified once DCS takes their kids they will never get them back. DCS is also ubiquitous; it operates in every Tennessee County. Each year since 2015 DCS has taken more children into custody than the year before. Its budget increases every year.

DCS likes to brag that it’s done this and that and more of the other but it hasn’t produced better outcomes. Many DCS caseworkers hate working for an agency that is focused more on procedure and control than actually helping needy kids.

As the Tribune has reported long-time employees who tried to help their clients often found themselves at odds with vindictive supervisors who harassed them until they quit. They are replaced by inexperienced caseworkers who are not trained to be effective social workers. Instead they learn quickly to apply often-arbitrary rules or face disciplinary action from autocratic supervisors. At least 20% of caseworkers leave every year. (See https://tntribune.com/inside-dcs-toxic-workplace/)

As we have also reported DCS mishandles cases does sloppy investigations or none at all and it operates with reckless disregard for the families and children they are supposed to serve. It is not just a dysfunctional system; it’s dystopian.

(See https://tntribune.com/twas-the-night-before-christmas/ and https://tntribune.com/another-child-dies-in-dcs-foster-care/)

The two main reasons given for moving children out of their homes and into foster care are sexual abuse and severe neglect. It turns out children are more likely to suffer sexual abuse in foster care often from other foster kids and numerous studies show foster kids do not “do better” than kids who grow up with their families regardless.

One 2007 study by an MIT researcher Prof. Joseph Doyle looked at outcomes for 15000 children in foster care. He compared them with comparably mistreated children left in their own home. On multiple measures the children left in their own homes did better. (see findings below)

A year later Doyle did another study of 23000 cases to find which children were more likely to be arrested as adults once they aged out of the system. In that study children left in their own homes also fared better.

A University of Minnesota study tracked outcomes of foster children from birth to age 9. They compared children in foster care and children under similar circumstances and found that the children left in their own homes did better.

University of Florida researchers looked at two groups of mothers who abused drugs during pregnancy. One group kept their babies the other had them taken away. After six months they tested the babies using the usual measures like rolling over sitting up and reaching out.

“Typically the children left with their birth mothers did better. For the foster children the separation from their mothers was more toxic than the cocaine” wrote Richard Wexler Executive Director of the National Coalition for Child Protection Reform.

Richard Wexler is a noted child welfare advocate and executive director of the National Coalition for Child Protection Reform.

The effects of foster care on older children aren’t any better. Consider the findings of a 2005 study in Oregon and Washington conducted by the Casey Family Programs and Harvard University. The subjects were 659 young adults between the ages of 20 and 33 who had been placed in family foster care between 1988 and 1998.

Overall: Over half of the alumni (54.4%) had current mental health problems while less than one-quarter of the general population (22.1%) had current mental health problems.

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): The prevalence of

PTSD within the previous 12 months was significantly higher among alumni (25.2%) than among the general U.S. population (4.0%).

As a comparison American war veterans have lower rates of PTSD (Vietnam: 15%; Afghanistan: 6%; and Iraq: 12% to 13%). PTSD depression and social phobia may be the most significant mental health conditions of alumni.

PTSD within the previous 12 months was significantly higher among alumni (25.2%) than among the general U.S. population (4.0%). As a comparison American war veterans have lower rates of PTSD (Vietnam: 15%; Afghanistan: 6%; and Iraq: 12% to 13%). PTSD depression and social phobia may be the most significant mental health conditions of alumni. Major depression: The prevalence of major depression within the previous 12 months was significantly higher among alumni (20.1%) than among the general population (10.2%).

“There are cases in which the trauma of removal bad as it is is less bad than leaving the child in her or his own home” Wexler said. But there are relatively few of those severe cases. Wexler said multiple studies show that the only way to fix foster care is to have less of it.

We asked Wexler to describe the perfect child welfare system.

“It would be one that focused on alleviating the worst stresses of poverty. Provide a guaranteed minimum income plus as needed rent subsidies childcare subsidies and universal health care and an enormous proportion of the cases agencies like DCS see would disappear.

Second where substance use really is an issue make high-quality family based drug treatment available on demand.

Where other help is needed let community-based community-run agencies design the help so it is geared to what families actually need.

Abolish mandatory reporting laws so professionals are free to exercise their professional judgment and families don’t need to be afraid to reach out for help.

Provide high quality family defense to make sure families can get the help they need – or simply be left along when DCS should never have been in their lives in the first place.

Shut down the group homes and institutions; replace them for the very few youth who need them with Wraparound services and therapeutic foster care.

Do that and there will be plenty of good foster homes available for the few children who really need them.”

Elected officials could get DCS to change course. Representative Gloria Johnson said Governor Bill Lee is ultimately responsible for Tennessee’s foster children. ““He’s their Daddy” she said.

Johnson and Senator Heidi Campbell are planning to introduce legislation to cap caseloads at 20 per worker and deal with other problems at DCS. Budget hearings will begin soon. DCS leaders will have to defend their poor record in front of the people who sign their paychecks.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiGWh0dHBzOi8vYXZhcy5tdi9lbi8xMTE5MDHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gov't aims to offer quality health services says VP,"Vice President Faisal Naseem has said the government aims to offer quality health services eliminating the need to travel abroad to seek medical services.

Faisal urged concerted efforts by government offices and institutions to improve access to public services. Public services must be provided without discrimination he said.

How to Create a Dividend Portfolio for Daily Cash

We can do this because most dividend stocks pay out on extremely consistent schedules. Investors love the certainty and dividend-paying companies try paying out in the same week even the same day every three months. That means with a little bit of strategy we can fill our portfolio with income stocks that will time our payments for every day of the week.

Now how this is going to work is through these three videos I’ll highlight those dividend income stocks that will be paying out in the next month. For example today we’ll highlight 17 dividend stocks that will pay out in December March June and September. I’ll show you exactly how I found these stocks later in the video but here you can see that I analyzed almost 400 dividend stocks to find the perfect income portfolio for each and every month.

The goal here is going to be about 60 stocks that will generate a dividend income on every weekday of each month. And the best part not only is this going to be a well-diversified portfolio producing constant dividends I’ve picked the best dividend stocks with a yield over 4%…that’s twice the average dividend yield on the market.

Dividend Stocks for Constant Cash Flow

Let’s jump right into that list then I’ll show you how I put together the portfolio of daily dividend stocks!

We’re getting started with a fan favorite Iron Mountain ticker IRM and one of the best dividend yields on the list at nine percent.

IRM is a records management provider with more than 225000 clients trusting it to store hard copy documents as well as digital transformations and storage. But the real value here comes in the form of the company’s real estate where all this is stored more than 90 million square feet across almost 1500 properties.

The company is set up as a real estate investment trust which means it gets a special tax break if it distributes at least 90% of profits to investors. That means you get that sky-high 9% yield with the stock going ex-dividend about mid-month in December March June and September.

IRM is a great start to our dividend portfolio and has grown its payout by 27% over the last five years.

Now remember the dates you’re going to see here on these dividend stocks are the ex-dividend date. How it works is a company’s Board of Directors declares the next dividend and the ex-dividend date. That ex-dividend date is the first day the shares trade WITHOUT the dividend so if you want that payout you want to make sure you pick up the shares at least one day before this.

The idea here isn’t to jump in or out of these dividend stocks so this isn’t going to matter as much to you long-term investors. Just put the stock in your portfolio and you’ll get that dividend every time it comes around.

Next on the list of daily dividend stocks powerhouse Altria Group ticker MO and its 8.8% dividend.

Now if you’re set against investing in some of these vice stocks then you can always substitute out another dividend payer that goes ex-dividend around the same time but for yield and dividend certainty it’s hard to beat Altria.

Besides owning the dominant tobacco brand in the U.S. and a dividend that has grown by 53% over the last five years Altria has some key investments that will help it grow. The company holds a 10% stake in the world’s largest brewer Anheuser-Busch and a 45% stake in cannabis giant Cronos Group. So you’ve got very stable cash flow from the tobacco and alcohol segments and that moonshot potential in cannabis.

Altria is one of the later stocks to go ex-dividend on our list late in December March June and September. That means you’ll usually get your dividend payment about two weeks later.

Our first stock in the financials $12 billion KeyCorp ticker KEY and its 5.8% dividend yield.

KeyCorp is a small regional bank with branches in 16 states but concentrated mostly in Ohio and New York. And those of you in the Nation now financials are one of my favorite sectors for the next couple of years. The sector has been slammed by low rates and is trading at a deep discount.

Case in point shares of KeyCorp trade for just 0.81-times book value which is a 38% discount to the 1.3 multiple it traded at last year. So potentially a lot of value to be unlocked if interest rates start heading higher and the economy keeps growing.

Beyond valuation and the high dividend yield KeyCorp has lately made some strong acquisitions in technology names like HelloWallet and Laurel Road which could give it surprise growth above other regional banks.

The dividend payment has boomed 146% over the past five years and usually goes ex-dividend during the first days of the month in December March June and August.

Another value play here $3.5 billion oil play Devon Energy ticker DVN and its 5% yield.

Next to financials energy is my other big call for the next few years and in fact I’ve added Devon Energy into our 2021 Bow Tie Nation portfolio on Stockcard.

If you’re looking for one sector where everyone is fearful and it may be time to be greedy it’s in the energy space. The price of oil crashed this year on loss of demand and the entire sector has fallen 49% year-to-date.

Will Oil Stocks Recover in 2021?

Being ahead of this means finding those cash-rich best of breed oil companies with the survivability to recover when the market does and Devon is one of the best in the space. The company has nearly $1.5 billion in balance sheet cash and will have no problem keeping up with its debt.

Despite dropping into negative earnings last quarter the company still beat the market estimate by 30% and is expected to return to profitability by the first quarter.

Shares usually go ex-dividend mid-month in December March June and September and paid out a special dividend August this year. Even the lowest analyst estimate has shares up 42% over the next year for a potentially huge upside along with the dividend.

Omnicom ticker OMC is the world’s second-largest ad holding company spanning public relations traditional and digital advertising.

Ad spending is the first to go when company budgets get tight so it’s no surprise that Omnicom has sold off this year but it’s still a solid company. The company has over $3.3 billion in balance sheet cash so no near-term financial problems and is trading at a discount of 38% from its peak.

Management has a history of beating expectations and is positioned to take advantage of the growth in digital ads. The dividend payment has grown a respectable 30% over the past five years and shares go ex-dividend early- to mid-month.

Adding some diversification here with Archer-Daniels Midland ticker ADM and its 2.9% dividend.

Agricultural producers have just started rebounding this year after years of trade war pain and I think there’s further to go for processors like ADM. The company has one of the largest networks for crop storage and transportation which should do well as the trade picture improves.

Even under the weaker environment the dividend here grew by 28% over the last five years and I expect that to pick up. Shares go ex-dividend mid- to late-month in November February May and August.

Another energy name here with Schlumberger Limited ticker SLB and its 3.3% dividend yield.

Now this one is probably the riskiest of my energy bets but still a fairly solid company with $3.8 billion in balance sheet cash. As an oil-field services company Schlumberger has seen its revenue plunge this year as explorers pull back and let some of their fields go into maintenance.

The company is one of the best in its industry with an advantage in drilling that’s hard to beat so there’s a very good chance this one survives and produces not only that dividend but a hefty price return as well. The dividend was cut 75% in June to protect cash flow but still pays that 3.3% yield and goes ex-dividend usually towards the beginning of the month.

How to Pick Dividend Stocks for Daily Payments

We’ve got ten more dividend stocks to highlight and stick with me because we’ve got the highest yields coming up.

I want to go through real quickly how I picked these stocks how I put the portfolio together so you can find your own dividend stocks or just adjust the portfolio when you need to.

Now the concept is easy but it took hours to put together the data on this. I took the 366 stocks in the S&P 500 that pay dividends nearly 400 large-cap companies I then went to the stock page for each one. You can find this on any investing platform but I went to Yahoo Finance and then to this Historical Data tab.

From here I changed the time period and then to Show Dividends Only to see the dividend dates for the last five years. I took that and copied it into my spreadsheet for every single stock noting the dividend dates over the last year.

Once I did that I could note when each dividend stock paid out on each day and then could pick the best for our portfolio. For example for today’s video there were 178 stocks going ex-dividend mid-November and into December.

This allowed me not only to create an income portfolio that pays out nearly every weekday of the month but also to select only the strongest companies with the highest dividend yields.

More Dividend Stocks You Can Count On

Prologis ticker PLD is in one of my favorite real estate types right now and pays a 2.25% dividend.

My Bow Tie Warriors out there you know I love real estate. Got my professional start there as a commercial property analyst and have my own rentals but some of the property types are looking UGLY this year!

Eight of the 12 REIT property sectors are posting losses this year with some getting absolutely smashed. Retail down 39% lodging is down 49% and office space is down 30% for 2020. But there are some sectors doing relatively well like industrial self-storage and data centers are booming.

And Prologis is a leader in that industrial space with 900 million square feet of logistics and warehouse property. Strength in the segment is being driven by ecommerce and the need for those distribution centers and it’s a great long-term trend to be in.

The dividend payment has increased by 45% over the last five years and usually goes ex-dividend mid-month December March June and September.

CBOE Global Markets ticker CBOE operates the options exchange in Chicago and pays a 2% dividend yield.

CBOE is one of the smaller exchanges that have yet to be consolidated into the larger companies but still operates the largest U.S. options exchange as well as a futures exchange. With the growth in retail stock trading this year I’m surprised shares haven’t done better and I like this one as a rebound play.

The dividend has nearly doubled growing 83% over the last five years and it’s a great cash-flow stock going ex-dividend late-month in November February May and August.

Another investor favorite on the list here with the 3M Company ticker MMM and its 3.5% dividend yield.

3M is one of the oldest companies on the list around since 1902 and one that has increased its dividend for an amazing 62-consecutive years.

The company operates in four segments; industrial transportation and electronics healthcare and consumer which gives it a breadth you probably won’t find anywhere else and helps protect that cash flow.

As big as it is the dividend growth surprised me here with 43% growth in the payment in the last five years along with a stable price return. Shares go ex-dividend mid-month in November February May and August.

Another in the financial sector this one in insurance with Prudential Financial ticker PRU and its 6.7% dividend.

Prudential is the second-largest life insurer in the U.S. with significant exposure in Japan as well. The entire industry has been hit on those low interest rates making it harder for insurers to earn a return on their cash reserves but management has released a plan to cut $500 million in costs to boost the bottom line.

Shares trade for a 30% discount on a price-to-book value trading for just 0.4-times the book value of assets and this one has grown the dividend by a solid 57% over the last five years.

Hey Nation while I’ve got you here can I ask a favor? If you’re on Instagram head on over after this video and join the Let’s Talk Money community. I’m sharing motivational quotes investing advice and a personal side I don’t get to show here on the channel so I hope I see you there.

Six more dividend stocks to round out the list and next is Waste Management ticker WM and its 1.9% dividend yield.

Now a 2% yield might not sound so great but this stock has produced an annualized 12.2% return on top of that yield over the last decade. It’s the largest solid waste services company in the U.S. with over 250 land fills and let’s face it probably one of the most stable business models there is.

The share price isn’t the only thing growing with the dividend up 42% over the last five years and one where you can count on future growth.

I highlighted Huntington Bancshares ticker HBAN recently as a favorite in the financials and its 6.3% dividend yield.

Huntington is another small regional bank with branches across eight states in the Midwest. The bank has doubled the amount in its loan loss provision account to over $1.7 billion and has still been able to consistently beat earnings expectations. It’s trading at a 35% discount to last year’s price-to-book multiple and if loan defaults aren’t as bad as feared could see a major earnings surprise.

Even with the slowdown over the past year the dividend has grown 114% over the last five years for a great yield on top of that price potential.

A little more of a safety pick here with PPL Corporation ticker PPL and its 6% dividend.

PPL is a regulated utility provider in Pennsylvania and Kentucky that recently announced plans to sell off its UK operations. That will take a lot of the uncertainty out of the business model and allow the company to focus on its U.S. operations. The move gives it more dividend stability and should also improve investor sentiment in the shares.

And that dividend uncertainty has played out with just a 10% dividend growth over the past five years the lowest in our group but I think you see it start rising from here.

Another agriculture play here with FMC Corporation ticker FMC and its 1.6% dividend yield.

Now another one with a relatively low dividend but an amazing total return producing a 12.6% annual price return over the last decade on top of that yield.

FMC is a pure-play crop chemical company and should benefit from that long-term trend to food demand and the need for higher crop yields. Shares are fairly valued here but it’s hard to argue with a 166% growth in the dividend over five years and that kind of long-term price return.

A little riskier bet in the real estate space is Ventas ticker VTR a healthcare REIT and its 4.3% dividend.

Ventas owns a portfolio of 1200 properties across medical office hospital and healthcare but concentrated in the senior living and skilled nursing niche. Most healthcare properties have been hit this year but most especially the senior care market but it looks like even this is turning more positive.

Occupancy hasn’t declined significantly and with a vaccine approval we should get better investor sentiment in names like Ventas. Shares are down 41% from last year’s peak and the company did cut the dividend this year to protect cash flow but I think it can be a strong long-term investment.

Valero Energy ticker VLO offers our highest yield of the group with a dividend just under 10%.

One of the largest refinery operations in the U.S. with 14 facilities in North America and the U.K. the company is uniquely positioned to refine lower-quality crude and has been able to produce higher profit margins.

The refineries have been hit just like all energy companies but quality names like Valero will survive. The company also owns over 3100 miles of pipeline and other midstream assets that give it a transportation advantage.

Valero is one of the very few in the energy space to maintain its dividend this year and has nearly doubled it over the past five years.

November Dividends List

The 17 stocks in this months portfolio produce a dividend yield of 4.9% just slightly above the entire 56-stock portfolio with a 4.2% yield. That’s 56 dividend-paying companies in every sector with a yield more than double the overall market that is going to put cash in your pocket every single day!

Investing in Dividends is Safe and Steady

What is the one thing everybody wants?

Money.

Everybody wants some more money but not everyone is willing to work hard for it. What if you are someone who does not want to have to work for your money? Well you can just leave that up to the stock market! Stocks are a way of owning part of a company and owning something means having rights to some of what that business makes. When companies make money they have to decide what to do with it put it in the bank (savings) invest in new equipment (capital expenditures) or give it back to shareholders (dividends).

However most companies choose option number 3 giving dividends back! There are two types of dividends: cash dividends and stock dividends. Cash dividends are just that money! You will get a check in your mailbox or direct deposited into your account. The amount changes every quarter since it depends on how much the company made.

Dividends are one of the most important things when it comes to buying stocks. There are many different types of investors you can be but dividends should definitely make up a big part of your strategy. If you do not actually get money every time the company makes money then what good does it do? Well dividends are taxed less than regular income so if you want to keep more of your own money they allow for this! Not only this but it is very safe. When they give you that money it is real money in your bank account (or brokerage statement). If something bad happens to the stock market then there is no chance they will go bankrupt and stop paying out dividends.

There are many different types of dividends you can get: quarterly dividend special dividend variable dividend high yield dividend  etc. They have different rules for how often you get them or how much they are. A good company will usually payout a very high percentage of their earnings each year as cash dividends – usually 4-5%. You are probably thinking this sounds too good to be true and you would be right. There are a few things to keep in mind when investing in dividend paying stocks.

Dividends are one of the most important things when it comes to picking stocks they can make a huge difference over time! They allow companies to pay back investors for all their hard work while still having some left over for themselves. Plus they offer lower risk than normal investments because they do not fluctuate as much as the stock price does. However beware that dividends may decrease or stop completely if you invest in a company during a bad period. It is also very important for investors looking for these high yields to have a lot of research on their potential investments.

Detrás del término hay un mercado que se acerca a los 17.000 millones de dólares según Cointelegraph Research. Y el mercado de NFT OpenSea es el responsable de procesar la mayor parte de estas transacciones con un volumen de operaciones que ha superado recientemente los 10.000 millones de dólares.

El potencial de los NFT va mucho más allá del arte y abarca la música los objetos de colección deportivos y los videojuegos mientras que su utilidad abarca tanto la propiedad como el acceso exclusivo a funciones y características únicas.

Desde CryptoPunks y el collage de Beeple hasta NBA Top Shot y RTFKT las siguientes colecciones destacaron no sólo por su número sino por sus crecientes comunidades. Para terminar el año 2021 echemos un vistazo a las 10 mejores colecciones y ventas en NFTs de este año.

CryptoPunks Larva Labs

Los CryptoPunks son los OG de los NFT según DappRadar. La colección se lanzó allá por 2017 antes de que existiera el estándar ERC-721 de NFT. Larva Labs liberó los 10.000 punks de forma gratuita para los usuarios de Ethereum y desde entonces la popularidad y el valor de CryptoPunks en el mercado secundario se han disparado.

Fuente: Larva Labs

En junio de 2021 un punk alienígena se vendió en Sotheby's por 1175 millones de dólares. En agosto Visa adquirió un CryptoPunk de 150.000 dólares para su colección corporativa y la agencia de Hollywood UTA firmó un acuerdo para utilizar CryptoPunks en los medios de comunicación convencionales. En agosto de 2021 se alcanzó la cifra récord de 400 millones de dólares gastados en CryptoPunks en un solo mes. En septiembre el cofundador de Reddit Alexis Ohanian asistió a la Gala del Met luciendo una insignia de CryptoPunks.

CryptoPunks ha visto el mayor volumen de negociación en OpenSea con 750.78832 ETH (3.040 millones de dólares). Su valor creciente y su poder de permanencia la convierten en la principal colección de NFT.

Bored Ape Yacht Club Yuga Labs

La colección con el segundo mayor volumen de operaciones en OpenSea es Bored Ape Yacht Club o BAYC con 261.81484 ETH (1.050 millones de dólares).

El equipo principal detrás de Yuga Labs está formado por cuatro amigos que querían ""hacer algunos monos aburridos poner a prueba nuestras habilidades y tratar de construir algo ridículo"" este año según su sitio web. El artista principal detrás de BAYC es All Seeing Seneca. Como propietario de uno de los 10.000 simios aburridos un NFT puede doblar como una tarjeta de miembro del Club Náutico y conceder acceso sólo a los miembros a THE BATHROOM el Bored Ape Kennel Club y el Mutant Ape Yacht Club o MAYC.

En septiembre Sotheby's vendió una colección de 107 BAYC NFT compuesta por 101 Bored Apes y seis Mutant Apes por 244 millones de dólares. Esta es la tercera venta de arte NFT fuera de la cadena más alta en una casa de subastas hasta la fecha después de las piezas NFT de Beeple. En noviembre un aumento de las ventas de OpenSea pareció estar relacionado con un incremento de más del 900% en el volumen de ventas de NFT de BAYC y MAYC probablemente debido a compradores famosos como Jimmy Fallon Post Malone que presentó NFT de BAYC en un vídeo musical y en las portadas de Bored Ape y Mutant Ape de la revista Rolling Stone. Más recientemente BAYC formó parte de una colaboración a cuatro bandas entre PUNKS Comic gmoney y Adidas Originals para el lanzamiento del proyecto Into the Metaverse NFT de Adidas.

Beeple

El artista de NFT Mike Winkelmann más conocido como Beeple y autodefinido como un ""tío que hace basura"" tiene el récord de la primera y la segunda pieza de arte digital más cara vendida en subasta pública y fuera de la cadena a partir de noviembre de 2021 según Art Market Research.

Tras la venta por parte de la casa de subastas británica Christie's de la obra de Beeple ""Everdays: The First 5000 Days"" en marzo de 2021 la pieza ""HUMAN ONE"" de Beeple se vendió por 289 millones de dólares en noviembre. ""HUMAN ONE"" es una caja tangible de dos metros de altura que gira y está hecha de pantallas LED. Puede exhibirse físicamente a diferencia de la mayoría de los NFT que viven en carteras digitales. Las imágenes de las pantallas serán editadas y actualizadas periódicamente mediante blockchain por Winkelmann en respuesta a los acontecimientos actuales según un comunicado de Christie's.

Beeple se convirtió en un nombre conocido en 2021 especialmente después de ganar el premio Maddox Gallery Artist Of The Year de GQ en septiembre y de sentarse con Jimmy Fallon en el programa de entrevistas nocturno The Tonight Show.

Axie Infinity Sky Mavis

Axie Infinity batió récords al convertirse en la primera dApp en superar los 2.000 millones de dólares en volumen de operaciones de NFT este año según un informe de la industria del tercer trimestre de DappRadar. Axie está justo por detrás de CryptoPunks en volumen de operaciones. El juego se trasladó recientemente a la solución Ronin sidechain y generó más de 776 millones de dólares en ingresos en el tercer trimestre.

Fuente: Axie Infinity

Los Axies son criaturas que se utilizan para batirse en duelo con otros jugadores luchar contra los enemigos y completar las misiones diarias. Estos NFT pueden criarse (acuñarse) comprarse y venderse y se valoran por su rareza y sus ventajas en el juego. En noviembre una parcela del juego de NFT de batalla contra monstruos se vendió por la lucrativa cantidad de 550 ETH (23 millones de dólares).

El cofundador de Axie Infinity Jeff ""Jiho"" Zirlin habló en un panel en la conferencia NFT BZL a principios de este mes sobre su creencia de que ""estamos en una batalla por el futuro de Internet y las comunidades de base como Axie están teniendo un impacto contra las grandes corporaciones"" refiriéndose a corporaciones como Facebook y Apple.

Axie Infinity se creó por primera vez en 2018 y actualmente lidera el sector del juego como pionero del movimiento play-to-earn o P2E. Y desde el lanzamiento de un programa de staking que permite a los usuarios poseer Axie Infinity Shards o tokens de gobernanza AXS el juego de intercambio atrae cada vez más a los jugadores.

NBA Top Shot Dapper Labs

NBA Top Shot es un popular juego de baloncesto de fantasía NFT que se lanzó por primera vez a finales de 2020. Como primer juego de coleccionismo deportivo de su clase los usuarios pueden coleccionar intercambiar y vender tarjetas como fichas digitales que representan a sus jugadores y momentos favoritos de la NBA. Los momentos más destacados pueden utilizarse para completar desafíos u organizarlos en vitrinas para mostrarlos a la comunidad.

Fuente: NBA Top Shot

Este verano los coleccionistas de Top Shot que estuvieron en persona en los partidos de la Liga de Verano de la NBA en Las Vegas pudieron comprar momentos en directo en el estadio. También se dio la bienvenida a la WNBA a Top Shot y se introdujo su primera entrega de paquetes de la WNBA.

Con licencia oficial de la Asociación Nacional de Baloncesto NBA Top Shot fue creada por Dapper Labs y construida sobre la cadena de bloques Flow. El volumen histórico de operaciones según DappRadar es de 7504 millones de dólares. Los tres NFT más vendidos fueron los de LeBron James de la temporada 2019-20 de Los Ángeles Lakers.

VeeFriends Gary Vaynerchuk

Detrás de VeeFriends está el empresario Gary Vaynerchuk también conocido como Gary Vee como artista y fundador del proyecto. Sus garabatos de animales dibujados a mano se vendieron en mayo por 51 millones de dólares en una subasta en la primera semana que según Vaynerchuk se embolsó en uno de los episodios de su podcast. Tras 90 días los ingresos de VeeFriends ascendían a 91 millones de dólares. Por los 40 millones de dólares adicionales Vaynerchuk recibió un 10% de regalías por cada transacción secundaria. En octubre Christie's subastó cinco personajes de VeeFriends por más de 12 millones de dólares.

La colección de VeeFriends está formada por 10.255 NFT de personajes y cada uno de ellos representa una propiedad intelectual. Una de las ventajas de poseer un VeeFriend es un bono de admisión de tres años a la superconferencia de varios días VeeCon. Un NFT llamado ""Hangout Hawk"" viene incluso con la oportunidad de recibir sesiones de tutoría con Vaynerchuk. Un coleccionista el YouTuber Dan Markham intercambió su Tesla Roadster por el NFT ""Puercoespín positivo"" del novelista gráfico Eli Burton. En el siguiente hilo de Twitter VeeFriends describe sus últimas colaboraciones con empresas desde el productor de juegos de cartas Uno hasta los grandes almacenes Nordstrom.

FLUF World

FLUF World es una colección de avatares 3D listos para el metaverso llamados FLUFs que viven como NFTs en la blockchain de Ethereum. Los FLUFs son avatares de conejos generados por programación. En una entrevista con Cointelegraph los fundadores de FLUF World con sede en Nueva Zelanda compartieron su enfoque para entrar en el metaverso. ""Teníamos esta fuerte creencia de que el metaverso de la Web 3.0 es esta visión creativa dirigida por la comunidad"" dijeron añadiendo:

""Cuando empiezas con historias y las entrelazas con personajes la gente se enamora de esos personajes. Y hemos querido construirlos de forma que sean dinámicos y atractivos. No es una obra de arte estática. Puedes ponerles nombre modificar los fondos o ponerles música nueva según tu estado de ánimo o tu vibración. Todos estos datos se almacenan en la cadena. Y los usuarios forman parte del viaje de cocreación con nosotros"".

Durante Art Basel Miami FLUF World organizó un evento FLUF Haus para presentar a la estrella pop de FLUF AngelBaby que ofreció el primer concierto metaverso en directo para los asistentes físicos y virtuales. FLUF Haus organiza eventos que involucran a artistas del mundo real en el metaverso y es la forma en que FLUF World permanece conectado con el mundo físico.

Los usuarios pueden comprar inmuebles virtuales llamados Burrows que sirven como espacios de reunión para los FLUF y otros avatares. La última adición a FLUF World incluye 9.669 Party Bears que se agotaron a los 10 minutos de salir a la venta para los usuarios que querían nuevos avatares para explorar el metaverso junto a los FLUFs y spider Thingies existentes.

Jadu Hoverboards y Jetpacks Jadu AR Inc.

¿Qué tienen en común la sensación musical canadiense Grimes el siete veces campeón del mundo de Fórmula 1 Lewis Hamilton y el legendario rapero estadounidense Snoop Dogg? Respuesta: junto con el desarrollador de realidad aumentada Jadu todos ellos están detrás del diseño de una serie de hoverboards NFT raros de Jadu para que los jugadores vuelen por la realidad aumentada dentro del metaverso.

La primera consistente en 1.111 Jadu Jetpacks se agotó en 20 segundos con un volumen total de 2.600 ETH (103 millones de dólares) negociados.

La colección Jadu Hoverboard también ha causado sensación con 1700 ETH (68 millones de dólares) de volumen acumulado negociado desde su creación. Recientemente Jadu recaudó 7 millones de dólares en una ronda inicial respaldada por destacadas empresas de capital riesgo como Coinbase Ventures para financiar el desarrollo del juego de realidad aumentada a escala mundial Mirrorverse que se lanzará el próximo año. Además Jadu se ha asociado con Sandbox para llevar sus jetpacks NFT al metaverso de este último. Tanto los jetpacks como los hoverboards serán compatibles con más de 40.000 avatares incluyendo colecciones populares como FLUFs y CyberKongz.

El Día de Regreso al Futuro es el momento perfecto para revelar el Jadu Hoverboard NFT.

RTFKT Studios

El 14 de diciembre Nike entró en el metaverso tras adquirir RTFKT con el objetivo de ofrecer coleccionables de nueva generación para salvar la brecha entre la cultura y el juego. RTFKT que se pronuncia como la palabra ""artefacto"" (en inglés) es un estudio que fomenta una nueva cultura de zapatillas digitales para los entusiastas de los videojuegos y del blockchain. En una entrevista exclusiva con Cointelegraph Chris Le cofundador de la firma dijo casualmente: ""Dirijo un equipo de artistas y conceptualizo los diseños de las zapatillas. Si me apetece ensuciarme las manos modelo las zapatillas en 3D hago todo el renderizado y fabrico las NFT"". A pesar de albergar sólo una pequeña colección de 13 NFT de zapatillas han alcanzado la impresionante cifra de 935 ETH (372 millones de dólares).

Aparte del calzado NFT RTFKT también acuñó una serie de 20.000 avatares tridimensionales en la blockchain de Ethereum llamada Clone X. Estos personajes del juego pueden utilizarse en reinos de realidad virtual descentralizados como Decentraland junto con otros artículos vestibles. En el momento de la publicación los estudios RTFKT tenían las principales colecciones en términos de volumen de transacciones incluyendo su colaboración Clone X con el artista Takashi Murakami y los Clone X Mintvials que se utilizan para canjear los Avatares Clone X.

Sandra Halliday Traducido por

Rocío ALONSO LOPEZ Publicado el

24 dic. 2021

experimentó un aumento en las ventas durante el apogeo de la pandemia en 2020 suponiendo su actividad online dos tercios de las transacciones y la compañía pudo reembolsar 3200 millones de libras esterlinas (3788 millones de euros) de deuda en efectivo según las cuentas presentadas en la feria Companies House.







Charlotte Tilbury



La marca de cosméticos y cuidado de la piel de ocho años fue vendida este año por 1300 millones de libras esterlinas (153888 millones de euros) al grupo español  según revelaron las cuentas un precio más alto que el de 1000 millones de libras que se había asumido en un primer momento. Tilbury maquilladora convertida en emprendedora de belleza tenía una participación mayoritaria en el momento de la venta por lo que habría recibido cientos de millones de libras del acuerdo. Sigue siendo una accionista minoritaria en la actualidad.



Entonces ¿qué pasa con el aumento de ventas? Subieron un 113 % en 2020 a 2585 millones de libras esterlinas (306 millones de euros) ya que mercados clave como el Reino Unido Europa continental y Asia continuaron comprando la marca a pesar de que los confinamientos estuvieron vigentes durante parte del período.

Publicidad

Esos confinamientos hicieron que sus tiendas estuvieran cerradas durante meses y ello provocó que las ventas online aumentaran a más del doble. Subieron un 115 % a 109 millones de libras (12903 millones de euros). Fueron respaldadas por una tienda virtual habilitada con tecnología completa con avatares de Tilbury y consultas de belleza por e-video. También fue importante el hecho de que la compañía continuara con su programa de lanzamientos mientras que algunos de sus competidores retrasaron los lanzamientos en un entorno en el que el maquillaje especialmente pasó a un segundo plano.



Pero parece que la fuerte presencia de Tilbury en redes sociales ayudó a mantener la marca en la mente de los consumidores algo que era crucial en un momento en el que las comunicaciones en las redes sociales estaban más presentes que de costumbre. La propia Tilbury tiene 44 millones de seguidores en .

La marca aprovechará este tiempo para preparar el asalto eléctrico que está por venir y desarrollar con cierta tranquilidad la tecnología que deberán emplear sus próximos modelos. Es lógico pensar que el Jaguar I-Pace será el punto de partida aunque solo sea por la experiencia adquirida con su diseño y su comercialización.

La situación actual de la marca contrasta mucho con la imagen que daba hace unos 10 años cuando parecía estar más fuerte que nunca y se permitía el lujo de presentar coches como el Jaguar C-X75 un automóvil que cerca estuvo de pasar a producción aunque finalmente solo se hicieron algunas unidades para una película.

Estaba animado por un grupo motor híbrido de nada menos que 850 CV. Un motor que combinaba un cuatro cilindros con doble sobrealimentación (turbo y compresor) de 16 litros inspirado en la Fórmula 1 que rendía 502 CV a 10.000 revoluciones. Un motor de carreras asistido por dos motores eléctricos que cuando se presentó eran los que mayor densidad de potencia y par ofrecían del mundo. Dos motores que añadían al cómputo final otros 390 CV.

Seis unidades para una película de James Bond

Cuando Jaguar decidió fabricar este espectacular coche se contó con la ayuda de Williams Advanced Engineering pero finalmente la crisis que comenzó en 2008 acabó por afectar también a la firma británica y se vieron obligados a detener el proyecto fabricando tan solo seis unidades para la película Spectre 007 de James Bond. Además ya por aquel entonces se estaba fraguando el despegue del coche eléctrico y la marca decidió centrar los pocos recursos que tenían en esa nueva tecnología (de ahí salió el mencionado Jaguar I-Pace).

PistonHeads

Así por tanto el único privilegiado en conducir un Jaguar C-X75 fue James Bond el agente secreto más famoso del cine. Pero no eran como se esperaba estos coches recibieron algunos cambios. Por ejemplo el motor no era el brutal grupo híbrido de 850 CV era un bloque V8 de 575 CV procedente del Jaguar F-Type SVR al tiempo que su habitáculo apenas se puede diferenciar del que podemos encontrar en cualquier coche de competición ya que no tiene nada que no sea necesario para conducir. Sin ir más lejos el volante ni siquiera tenía airbag.

El chasis tampoco era lo que se esperaba pues Williams Advanced Engineering creó un marco tubular al que ancló las suspensiones el motor V8 y los paneles de la carrocería que ahora sí eran calcados a los del prototipo. Sin embargo no todos los C-X75 de la película Spectre son iguales porque cuatro de los seis ejemplares fueron destinados a acrobacias es decir estaban destinados a las escenas de acción donde no tendrían buen final. Los otros dos se emplearían en diferentes escenas y secuencias.

Siéntete como el malo de James Bond a los mandos de un Jaguar C-X75

No obstante puedes sentirte como el malo de James Bond conduciendo un Jaguar C-X75 a todo trapo por las calles de tu ciudad siempre que tengas el dinero suficiente claro. El portal Pistonheads tiene una de las unidades a la venta concretamente el chasis 007 y a tenor de las imágenes es evidente que no fue uno de los coches de acrobacias sino no de los usados para las imágenes de los protagonistas y de primer plano. Eso explicaría los dos pequeños agujeros que tiene en el capó (realizados para sujetar las cámaras).

Esta unidad cuenta con todo lo mencionado anteriormente es decir un chasis tubular de acero y el motor V8. También equipa suspensiones específicas para rallye de un POrsche 911 GT3 frenos AP Racing y un freno de mano hidráulico para que las derrapadas sean más fáciles. Acabó en manos de su propietario actual después de la grabación de la película vendido directamente por Jaguar-Land Rover. El precio es de 864.000 libras más de un millón de euros.

Para el comercio electrónico igual es incidente pero por debajo de mayo y octubre.

Diciembre. Calor árbol y pan de pascua luces villancicos… y largas filas fuera de las tiendas y centros comerciales para conseguir todos los regalos de la lista. Por ese motivo es que no fue sorpresa que a nuestro buzón del Contestadog de Watchdog PAUTA llegara la siguiente pregunta: ¿Qué tan importante es la Navidad para el comercio?

El papel protagónico de las ventas navideñas

Las festividades son instancias que repercuten de manera positiva en el comercio. El aumento de las ventas se da principalmente en ocasiones como el Día del Padre de la Madre los cyber days black friday y la Navidad la que se corona como la fecha más importante del año.

Según George Lever gerente de Estudios de la Cámara de Comercio de Santiago (CCS) diciembre es por lejos el mes más importante para el comercio ya que representa entre el 11% y 12% de las ventas anuales.

Cifras similares son las entregadas por la Cámara Nacional de Comercio (CNC) que a partir de una encuesta propia realizada a 895 locales comerciales obtiene conclusiones casi idénticas. “Históricamente se puede ver que diciembre acumula el 12% de las ventas anuales del retail y en categorías como electrónica llega a alcanzar un 17% y en vestuario un 15%” asevera el informe.

“Durante estas fechas aumentan las visitas las ventas y la actividad en todo el ecosistema de los centros comerciales porque también se incrementa la demanda de servicios al coincidir con el fin de año” menciona Katia Trusich presidenta de la Cámara de Centros Comerciales.

Sin embargo el impacto positivo de las compras navideñas no ocurre únicamente en las grandes tiendas del retail sino que también se ven beneficiadas las pymes. Marco Rivas presidente de la Asociación de Emprendedores de Chile asegura que “la Navidad representa una oportunidad para que sea realmente una suerte de respiro para todas las pymes que estuvieron paralizadas por mucho tiempo”.

Juan José del Pino cofundador y director de Apyme explica que diciembre es relevante para el comercio porque además de Navidad abarca Año Nuevo. Agrega que durante el último mes del año las ventas suben alrededor de 50% aunque depende de cada rubo en particular. “Claramente este año vamos a tener que comparar cifras del comercio electrónico versus el tradicional” complementa.

Para el comercio electrónico la Navidad también es muy relevante. Sin embargo en comparación con el comercio presencial o tradicional para el e-commerce esta fecha queda desplazada al tercer lugar en importancia. “Mayo y octubre son claramente los meses más relevantes para el comercio electrónico debido a los eventos cyber los que explican prácticamente el 25% de las ventas anuales online” señala Lever.

En el estudio de Consumo Navideño 2021 realizado por Deloitte queda en evidencia que el canal digital se ha utilizado con bastante frecuencia este año (47%). Además el 30% de los entrevistados declaró que utilizó por primera vez alguna plataforma digital de compra cifra similar a la de 2020 (36%).

Y si bien puede que la Navidad no lidere las ventas en el e-commerce diciembre continúa siendo un mes importante. En Pauta Final de Radio PAUTA el country manager de Falabella.com Domingo Lama comentó que en cuando termina el black friday en noviembre las ventas y visitas relacionadas con las categorías navideñas se duplican.

“En general pasa que en otros años el consumidor sigue comprando online hasta cerca del 18 y 19 de diciembre porque después no se quieren arriesgar a que el producto no llegue y ahí es donde hemos puesto todos nuestros esfuerzos. Hoy día el 70% del catálogo lo tenemos para una entrega en menos de 48 horas que es vital para nosotros para extender el periodo navideño en diciembre” aseguró Lama.

El efecto de la pandemia

La celebración de la Navidad ha experimentado algunos cambios en los últimos dos años debido a la pandemia. Lever menciona que en las mismas fechas del 2020 las ventas fueron 9% superiores que el año previo lo que atribuye a dos factores. “Por un lado los hogares experimentaron un fuerte aumento en sus ingresos debido a los dos primeros retiros y a los subsidios estatales. Pero por otro la restricción de aforos en el comercio físico limitó la capacidad de venta conteniendo lo que pudo ser un crecimiento de dos dígitos”.

Las restricciones también afectaron a los medianos y pequeños empresarios. Pino asegura que “el año pasado las pymes afectadas por la pandemia fueron alrededor del 40% a 50% con caídas de ventas superiores al 60%”.

Otro de los puntos relevantes en torno a esta fecha es el stock disponible. Según una encuesta realiza por la CNC el 302% de las empresas consultadas dicen que no cuentan con el debido stock mientras que el 42% declara que sí lo tiene ya que preparó por adelantando sus pedidos. En tanto el 28% restante sostiene que está con su abastecimiento normal para estas fechas.

Desde el comercio afirman que pese a las complicaciones en cuanto a la importación de productos durante tramos de este año creen haber asegurado una cantidad suficiente. Lever dice que “hay disponibilidad de stocks con algunas categorías más estrechas que eventualmente muestran menor disponibilidad o plazos de entrega más extensos”.

Para las pymes la disponibilidad de productos también es un reto durante estos periodos. Rivas explica que uno de los desafíos “tiene que ver con problemas a nivel de importación por embarques atrasados crisis mundial de contenedores logística interna con falta de camiones y una demanda que no baja por mayor liquidez”. Agrega que pese a esto muchas pymes se han preparado desde mediados de año para contar con stock aunque hay que considerar que “alrededor del 95% de los productos que se venden en las fiestas por las pymes son importados principalmente desde China”.

When it comes to ease of use Tech.co boils it down to two categories: the simplicity of the software and the feel of the hardware.

First off transferring data between an old Pixel 2 and the new Pixel 4 was seamless – a short five minute process facilitated by simply plugging the two devices together with a USB-C cable. The entire device was quickly set up with previously installed apps and existing data from our old phone. A few apps were deleted (like a voice memo app) in favor of the newly added features (like the mind-bending Recorder app from Google).

On the software side navigating the interface is nothing short of seamless. You can opt for gesture control or the three-button navigation option each providing simple means of accessing the home screen apps page or to “go back.” Plus with dedicated Google Assistant features throughout and the the Pixel Neural Core assisting any machine learning processes you’re never more than a click or two away from what you’re trying to access as the device often predicts which app you need or which email you’re looking for.

As for the hardware Google definitely went for sleek and stylish with the Pixel 4. The decidedly thin body combined with the smaller frame makes it incredibly comfortable in your hand. As we mentioned the glass front and back make it pretty slippery but the matte sides will keep it firmly within your grasp if you opt to go without a case.

Naturally with a device this thin the Pixel 4 does not have a headphone jack. But hey you should probably have some Bluetooth headphones by now Google hopes…

Pixel 4 Battery Life

Considering battery life is one of the most important smartphone features to customers Google surprisingly dropped the ball on this one. The Pixel 4 boasts a 2800mAh battery which is notably smaller than the rest of the industry. The company said it went for a sleeker build and that battery life suffered as a result but there’s not a person on Earth that wouldn’t trade a few millimeters of smartphone girth for a couple extra hours of battery life.

In practice the Pixel 4 will last approximately 14 hours on a full charge with light use a woeful comparison to other models on the market. To make matters worse getting rid of battery draining features like Gesture Control and Ambient EQ don’t save much time either so you’re likely going to need to keep an eye on the battery more than you’d want.

Like the Pixel 3 the Pixel 4 is equipped with wireless charging and it’s actually not much slower than the fast charging found via the USB-C cable. However it does heat the phone up a bit which can be unsettling although not an inherent problem.",,,,,,

A pass from defenceman Tyson Barrie was blocked by Kraken winger Brandon Tanev leading to a breakaway. Tanev a player regarded around the league for his speed got to centre ice before Barrie and Yamamoto reached the midway point between the blue and red lines. It looked like he was home free.

Yamamoto refused to quit on the play. He pushed hard to reel in Tanev by the hashmarks and then lifted his opponent’s stick just enough to hinder the shot quality. Oilers goalie Stuart Skinner turned aside an attempt that ended up being much more routine than it could have been.

That was just the beginning for Yamamoto.

Barrie picked up the rebound and transitioned the puck back the other way. The Oilers on a power play now had a greater advantage with Yamamoto and Tanev held up well behind the action.

Yamamoto beat Tanev back up the ice gliding into position inside the offensive blue line and cocked his stick for one-timer as he readied himself for a Leon Draisaitl pass. The Oilers winger unleashed a low shot from the high slot which went off Chris Driedger’s right pad and right onto the stick of Warren Foegele for an easy goal.



Though it hasn’t been a banner season for Yamamoto so far especially offensively it’s shifts like this that keep him in the good graces of his coaches and superstar teammates.

“We ask our top guys who they want to play with and he would be one of those guys” assistant coach Glen Gulutzan said last week. “There’s a saying in the league that the players know who can play and who can’t. Our top guys like what this guy brings.”

“There’s a reason why we’ve been playing together for so long” Draisaitl added.

The efforts before Foegele’s goal highlighted three aspects that are either hallmarks of Yamamoto’s game or have come into focus this season — his skating his determination and his shot. Two of those traits got Yamamoto to the NHL. Fine-tuning the other could help elevate him from a good player to something much more.

Those traits have all been worked on throughout the years and recent summers back home not too far from Seattle.

Getting from Seattle to Spokane takes about an hour by airplane or roughly five hours in a car. The 450-kilometre drive east can be treacherous especially in a hellacious snowstorm through the Snoqualmie Pass.

There’s a modest but close-knit hockey community in Spokane. Only a few players from the city have gone on to make the NHL. Two Yamamoto and Derek Ryan currently play for the Oilers.

Ryan is nearly 12 years older than Yamamoto. He first noticed his future teammate when he was 14 or 15 while helping to run a hockey camp in Spokane for young kids. The pint-sized Yamamoto was in attendance with his older brother Keanu.

“We noticed both Keanu and Kailer right away just because they were good players” Ryan said. “They were fast guys flying around out there.”

The boys’ father Russ was a good athlete. He wrestled played semi-pro soccer in Spokane and raced motorcycles nationally. (His first bike number was 56 coincidentally the digits his youngest son was given with the Oilers.)

Russ and his wife LeAnn put their boys in lots of sports — Yamamoto would play soccer wrestle box and became an excellent left-handed pitcher — as well as their oldest child daughter Kyra who was an accomplished downhill skier. The boys gravitated to hockey before they were 2 years old.

Keanu now a forward at McGill University in Montreal got hooked thanks to the son of a family friend. Kailer followed his brother.

Yamamoto’s ability to track down one of the NHL’s fleetest skaters in Seattle was years in the making.

Russ would duct tape skate guards over the blades so his 20-month-old son could walk around the house in his skates to strengthen his ankles.

“He would just run all over the house up and down the stairs and I’d just let him go crazy” Russ said while sitting in the kitchen of the family’s home for the last decade a bungalow in the city’s north end. “He always wanted to put them on because of his brother.”

LeAnn’s parents Don and Sharon Russell often took the boys to their first skating classes before they turned 2. Don went on the ice and would have to entice them to skate by offering candies either M&M’s or Skittles. It was the mother of another Spokane NHL alum Tyler Johnson’s mom Debbie who first taught Yamamoto how to skate properly when he was 3.

His first hockey coach was Olga Pasher who focused on the basics and preached fun above all else. She coached Yamamoto for two seasons the first when he was 4.

“She’s a little sweetheart” Yamamoto said in an interview with The Athletic before his first NHL game in his home state earlier this month. “She’s probably the sweetest lady I’ve ever met in my entire life. So cute. Anytime I see her I always just have a big smile on my face.”

Now 82 Pasher was born and raised in Edmonton before moving away in 1965. She settled in Spokane two years later. She became involved in the hockey scene when she saw an ad in the local paper looking for someone to run a women’s league. She figured it would be a good way to meet people. She then started playing the sport — only hanging up her skates two years ago — and eventually got into coaching minor hockey.

As a coach Yamamoto was her star pupil.

“He picked it up right away” she said. “He was born on skates.”

And before she met Yamamoto Pasher had become a diehard Oilers fan from afar particularly of Wayne Gretzky. There is a bedroom in her house devoted to No. 99 filled with collectables and jerseys.

However she’d had this vintage Oilers jersey for years and for whatever reason held off on getting it crested with Gretzky’s name and number. She attended the 2017 draft with the family knowing Yamamoto could get selected in the first round. She was blown away when the Oilers the team from her hometown selected him 22nd overall.

She waited until Yamamoto signed his most recent contract with the Oilers in September and knew he was going to keep his No. 56 before bucking tradition.

Pasher attended the Oilers’ first two games of the season in Edmonton but the jersey was still out for stitching then. She lent it to Russ to wear to the Oilers-Kraken game in Seattle on Dec. 3.

“It’s not a Gretzky it’s a Yamamoto” she said gleefully as she presented it to Russ.

Russ knew very little about hockey when his boys started playing. But he did his research and realized how important skating was to being successful — especially since Kailer and Keanu were on the smaller side.

So by the time they each turned 6 their parents put them in power skating lessons twice a week.

“If we want them to have any kind of a competitive edge we knew that they had to work on being faster” LeAnn said.

They turned to Berkley Villard a national silver medallist in singles figure skating in 1987 who transitioned to helping hockey players with their strides after retiring in 1990. She was the skating coach for the WHL’s Spokane Chiefs from 1998 until 2013. She was called up by then-coach Mike Babcock who gave her 15 minutes on the ice with his players to see if she was a good fit. Babcock came down after 10 minutes leaned over the glass to tell her she had the job and then left.

With Yamamoto and his older brother she wanted to keep sessions light at an early age.

“It’s not a sprint. It is a marathon” she said. “You can’t be overwhelming 6-year-olds with information. They have to be kids.

“But it’s important that your base is done very young.”

Yamamoto worked with Villard through his mid-teenage years. He still texts with her regularly and has gone to see her for summertime sessions as recently as 2019 when COVID restrictions weren’t in place.

Villard wants to retire from coaching but she can’t say no when Russ and Kailer come calling. In their most recent work she had him hopping from his outside edges to inside ones. The goals: improving his stride quickness agility footwork and keeping a low centre of gravity.

“I learned how to skate from Tyler Johnson’s mom but she took me to the next level with my skating” Yamamoto said. “I don’t think I’d be here without her.”

“It’s miles (better) but he’s been good since he was young” she said. “He was definitely born with talent.”

Ryan has seen Yamamoto’s skating come a long way too especially since that first encounter all those years ago. They’ve skated together in the offseasons in Spokane for the last few years.

“He’s good on his edges. He’s good at cutting left right” Ryan said. “He’s able to make those elusive moves even in a league like this the NHL where it’s pretty tight checking. He can get the puck down low and he can evade guys.”

The brotherly battles are still very much real today.

“Even today if you eat dinner with them they’re racing to see who can finish their plate first” Russ said laughing. “It’s kind of crazy.”

The good news: no one is getting teeth knocked out anymore the way Yamamoto did when he was 8 or 9. That was the result of his older brother pushing him into the crossbar of their hockey net after Yamamoto got by him while playing roller hockey in the basement.

Yamamoto wanted to do everything his big brother did. But it wasn’t good enough just to tag along despite the two-year age gap.

“Kailer always had to be better than him” Russ said.

“I’ve always just wanted to be better than my brother” Yamamoto said. “It’s just that sibling rivalry. I don’t think I’d be here where I am without him either. He pushed me so many ways that he probably has no idea and so I’m very thankful for that.”

He never backed down. The excellent competition at home helped push Yamamoto from a young age and it wasn’t long before he outgrew the minor hockey scene in Spokane. Yamamoto’s peer group wasn’t as strong as it was for his older brother.

“If your age group’s not the greatest you’ve got to venture out and try to find other avenues other teams” Yamamoto said. “I had to do that growing up.”

By the time he was 8 Yamamoto was being driven to Seattle — sometimes in lousy weather during that five-hour trip — every weekend for games.

“I’d be asleep in the back or watching a movie” he said smiling.

Yamamoto got recruited to play spring hockey with a team in Vancouver when he was 10. That lasted four years.

It was then that he and his parents realized a hockey career of some sort — even if it was just playing collegiately — could be in the cards. He was hanging with top Canadian kids. In some cases parents and teammates were envious of Yamamoto’s skills.

“I always thought I was decent. I’ve always felt like I’ve been one of the better players on my team” Yamamoto said. “But when you play with other guys up in Canada and you’re just as good as them it makes you start to think.”

“That whole mentality about kids playing hockey was so completely different from Spokane. All of them thought their kids were going to the NHL and they all talked about it” LeAnn said. “It gave us hope.”

Yamamoto was asked by a team in Los Angeles to play for them when he was 12. They originally wanted him for their Brick summer tournament team in Edmonton. They offered to find him a billet family with which to live for the season.

It felt too young to have him leave permanently LeAnn said. But Yamamoto flew to some practices and met his teammates at tournaments as far away as Dallas.

“They were far” Yamamoto said. “It was a headache for sure.”

He moved to L.A. to join the team as a regular when he was 14. He spent two years there before moving back home to play for the WHL Chiefs with his brother.

The time and distance apart weren’t always easy — Keanu spent a year travelling to Seattle and a couple seasons in Los Angeles too — but it all worked out. Russ said his father left no stone unturned for him to pursue his athletic interests. He wanted to pay it forward.

“I would have done anything to put them to the next level” he said.

He found it was easy to invest in his boys when they pushed hard to excel. They were always in the family basement rollerblading or shooting pucks.

Russ put Kailer into wrestling and boxing in his early teenage years just to make sure he could defend himself despite his stature. Yamamoto listed at 5-foot-8 and 153 pounds now is one of the smallest players in the NHL.

“They are little but I didn’t want them to think were little. I don’t think they do” Russ said. “I think they can compete with anybody now.”

“My mindset was I always wanted to be the best” Yamamoto said. “I know I was smaller. People would always say ‘He’s never going to make it. He’s too small.’ I always wanted to prove those people wrong.”

His willingness and fortitude to take on any opponent and often come out with the puck has been one of Yamamoto’s best attributes as an NHLer.

This season however his coaches have found there’s been a bit of a dip in that regard.

“We expected more from Yamo” associate coach Jim Playfair said last week. “When we reflect back and remember when Yamo came here (full time in December 2019) he was a competitive player. He was hard on pucks. He had second and third effort. He was pushing the pace of the game.

“I don’t think we’re seeing that as consistently as we have in the past.”

It’s still there in spurts — just as it was against Seattle last Saturday.

“He keeps plays alive for people and extends plays and he can win battles” Gulutzan said. “When he does that that’s why the top guys want to play with him.”

Yamamoto was part of the hottest line in the NHL for just over two months at the beginning of 2020. He looked like an offensive force with Draisaitl and Ryan Nugent-Hopkins posting 26 points in 27 games — largely on the strength of his five-on-five efforts.

To spread out the wealth and give Connor McDavid some help the coaching staff started tinkering with the lines in early March. Nugent-Hopkins got more and more shifts with McDavid. Then the pandemic halted action.

In the playoff series against Chicago Draisaitl Nugent-Hopkins and Yamamoto were only used as a trio as a fallback option. It was a confusing period for the young winger.

His production then plummeted last season to eight goals and 21 points in 52 games.

So in the offseason Yamamoto wanted to make improving his shot a priority. He scored on 25 percent of his shots on goal in 2019-20. That efficiency fell to a much more normal 11.6 percent last season.

The issue was more the quality and quantity of his attempts.

Russ who works in the construction industry rigged together a baseball-style backstop and eventually draped over a protective net when pucks started ricocheting into the neighbour’s backyard. A sheet of synthetic ice was used to propel the pucks to try to replicate the traditional surface.

Grandma and Grandpa Russell live next door and would watch Kailer and Keanu blast pucks through the window. They were outside with a stick in hand every day in the summer.

“We ordered like 75 orange pucks so we were shooting heavier pucks. It was just trying to work on just the hardness and accuracy” Yamamoto said. “My dad did an awesome job. Just being able to start from scrap and just put it together was awesome.”

The rip on net against Seattle that led to Foegele’s goal however was a rarity this month.

Before that shot on Driedger Yamamoto went seven games without hitting the net. He has just five goals and seven points in 29 games. At five-on-five Yamamoto has four goals and an assist while spending almost the entirety of the season on the second line with either Draisaitl or Nugent-Hopkins as his centre.

“I know he worked lots on his shot in the summer. Now it’s about putting himself in more consistent positions to use his shot” Playfair said. “Certainly Yamo has more to give and we need to find that.”

Added Gulutzan: “Where he has to improve as with any young player is his finishing ability. He’s a work in progress.”

Some of it is a mindset that started at home.

“Growing up I was always an assist guy” Russ said. “I always told my kids ‘An assist is way better than a goal.’ And so they passed all the time. They would rather give that guy the goal. I really blame it on me.”

Yamamoto has heard the critiques of his game loud and clear. Even though he feels like he’s contributing in other ways — defensively and being hard on the puck as was the case in Seattle — he’s putting pressure on himself to score a few more goals.

“I’m not scoring at a crazy rate. But there’s a saying that if you can score in practice you can score in a game” he said. “I feel like I’m scoring a lot more in practice.”

When he’s skating well driven to succeed on every play and using his shot effectively Yamamoto is a key cog for the Oilers. He’s also been a mainstay on the penalty kill this season as he continues to round out his game.

How he fits into the team’s plans is unclear though.

Yamamoto needed a new contract before this season and it was expected he’d get a two-year bridge deal. Negotiations dragged on however and he signed a one-year contract instead just days before the start of training camp. He’s slated to be a restricted free agent again in the offseason this time with arbitration rights — joining fellow right winger Jesse Puljujarvi in that category.

Oilers GM Ken Holland said earlier this week that he plans on waiting until the summer to talk contract with Yamamoto’s camp adding he’ll get a deal done.

However the Oilers are projected to be tight against the salary cap for next season which could make a new deal challenging. They’re also expected to make some upgrades at forward before the trade deadline which has the potential to make Yamamoto expendable.

All the uncertainty hasn’t been easy on him.

That doesn’t mean it’s smart to bet against him — not after all the work he’s put in to get this far.

He’s left the team wanting a little more this season but the base for a solid NHL player is there. His cheering section from Spokane believes in him.

“The biggest thing for me is I never doubted it” Villard said. “It’s not actually surprising to me.”

“You bring up this little kid and now he’s up here. It’s unreal” added Pasher.

Impactful shifts like the recent Seattle one have to happen more consistently for Yamamoto to take the next step in his career.

His fellow Spokane native believes that’s just a matter of time.

“He’s young” Ryan said. “He’s obviously learning more and more every day what it takes to be in the NHL what it takes to stay here. He’s extremely skilled.

“I’m just trying to be there for him a little bit … and help him do all the right things it takes to have a long career which I think he can have in this league.”

“It’s short for Mush Mouth” Allocco said. “My dad used to call me that because I was always running my mouth.”

It’s actually an endearing nickname that has stuck with Allocco even as he moved on from a stellar high school career in Ohio to join the team at Princeton.

“It’s a quality we appreciate” Tigers coach Mitch Henderson quipped as Allocco’s was explaining its origins.

It sets the 6-foot-4 sophomore guard apart from his teammates some of whom are more comfortable leading by example than vocally.

“We all have our strengths and weaknesses and that’s one of mine and I think it can help the team” Allocco said. “Whatever I can do to help the team is what I’m going to try to do. That’s what I’m good at so I’m going to keep doing it.”

What Allocco and his teammates are doing is working. Princeton is off to a 10-3 start its best since the 2013-14 season and is ranked among the top 30 nationally in 2-point FG% 3-point FG% effective FG% and 3-poitners made per game.

Almost all of them have said the team chemistry is best they’ve every been a part of.

“The team ever since I showed up on campus has been unbelievable” Allocco said. “We’re all best friends now. We can hang around each other and on the court we are great teammates. It’s been easy to fit in.”

That Allocco ended up in a college basketball uniform shouldn’t come as any surprise if you knew anything about his family also one with deep New Jersey roots.

His father Greg grew up in Berkley Heights and starred at Governor Livingston and played at Susquehanna University. His older siblings sister Carly and brother Chris both played in college. He’s related to the famous Frank Allocco a New Providence legend who played basketball and football at Notre Dame.

“I’m the youngest in my family” Allocco said. “…I got a ton of family around New Jersey. We’re some big names historically. I kind of come from a basketball bloodline.”

That’s one of the things Henderson likes about him.

“It’s in the blood” the coach said.

Allocco has carved out an important role on this team: come off the bench and provide stable ball handling and defense and knock down an open 3-pointer when it presents itself.

He’s appeared in all 13 games averaging 18.4 minutes. He had a big steal in a recent victory over UMBC that sparked a late 7-0 run to secure the victory.

It was the exact kind of play his coach is counting on him to make.

“We have an identity and we want to keep chopping at it and making it sharper” Henderson said. “We’ve come a long way since we opened up against Rutgers-Camden. It feels like a really different team. That’s a really good thing. I wasn’t sure how this would go but I’m very pleased with where we are. It’s just the beginning. Now the real stuff starts.”

The real stuff the coach is alluding to is Ivy League play.

Allocco hasn’t experienced it yet but he’s ready.

“I’m excited to get into those environments” he said. “We’ve come in with a mentality that we’re going to get a little better each day and I think we have. We compete and we have some focuses on active hands running into gaps staying in front of the ball and I think we’re only going to continue to improve.”",,,,,,

PHOENIX — Curbside pickup has really taken off since the start of the pandemic. For some it offers safety others convenience.

It's something many in the Valley will be doing on Friday as the mad rush to ensure a merry Christmas is underway.

One Phoenix woman is warning shoppers that she never got her order.

Valerie Barnett said she purchased $40 dollars worth of food and miscellaneous items at the end of November.

She didn't pick it up same day because she came down with a headache.

Two days later she got an alert from Walmart reading 'your items have been picked up.'

""If someone is going to go and sit in an area and take an order that’s not theirs knowing it's not theirs I think it’s a scam"" Barnett said. ""It's like the person at the airport who waits for everybody to get luggage and whatever is left he picks up and leaves it's a scam it's stealing.""

According to Walmart's website after a time slot is given the retailer provides a four-day window for pickup and will hold your items for up to seven days if you're a no-show.

""They steal your boxes off your front porch like they're not going to sit and watch an order come out it’s a sad state of affairs when people are stealing like that.""

After several phone and online customer service exchanges Barnett was issued a refund.

She has a word of advice for others:

""If you're going to do an online order as soon as it's ready go get it don’t wait"" she encouraged. ""That’s just leaving the door open for anybody to get it to grab it and you might not be as lucky as me in getting a refund even though Walmart is pretty good about that I think.""

Barnett claims customer service told her the items were not placed back on the shelves as many on social media suggested might have happened. That's what led her to believe this was theft.

She also said her ID was not checked the previous time she did curbside pickup.

DIS,Walt Disney,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vbW91c2VwbGFuZXQuY29tL2Rpc25leS10LXNoaXJ0cy1yZXZpc2l0ZWQvODE1OS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Disney T-Shirts Revisited,"As you may have read last month I finally made it back to the magic! After a two-year drought I headed down to the sunshine state and experienced what Walt Disney World had to offer as it celebrates the big five – oh. I hit all four theme parks Bizzard Beach and pigged out (oh how I missed Goofy's Candy Company). I of course also checked out all the merch.

In that area the thing that struck me the most kind of took me by surprise. Of course I loved the 50th commemorate items the artwork and the watches. Those will always be my favorites—but surprisingly it was the T-shirts that grabbed my attention once again. I wrote an article a few years ago about the T-shirts and how Disney was moving beyond generic images of the Fab 5 and the park logo. I'm happy to report that the trend has continued in a big way.

There are literally dozens of different T-shirts available for everyone.

This article is supposed to run on Christmas Eve and my guess is you want to spend time with your families and friends and not hours and hours with me reading a ton about T-shirts so this month's article will be light on words and heavy on pictures of a bunch of my favorites. So here we go with a sampling of what's available at the World.

First comment is that the selection is massive. At outlets such as World of Disney the Emporium and Creations there's generally a wall of T-shirts with a huge selection to choose from.



The wall of T-shirts at World of Disney is huge. Photo by Gregg Jacobs.

At the big stores I mention above there are probably 30 or 40 different shirts to choose from and while there was duplication at the different places on property there was still quite a variety.

The first group of T-shirts I noticed were those that used Disney characters and had funny (and sometimes more adult oriented) sayings.



“Peter Pan” is quite fly. Photo by Gregg Jacobs.

Peter Pan and Pluto are being used in a funny way with sayings like “What up Dog” and “I'm so fly” (which I suppose he is).



I love Pluto and this funny saying. Photo by Gregg Jacobs.

Funnier still is a T-shirt for someone who might want more than just a ride on Space Mountain.



Anyone want to advertise that they're single? Photo by Gregg Jacobs.

Maybe wearers of the single ride T-shirt just want to go on the Test Track single rider line?

Next up while I love the Fab 5 Elsa and Anna and Ariel it's nice to see lesser-known characters show up in unusual ways.



A funny Hei Hei shows up on this one. Photo by Gregg Jacobs.

Remember Hei Hei the not terribly smart chicken companion of Moana? One shirt extols the virtue of living your life like Hei Hei without a care in the world.

The “minor” character theme also extends to them park mainstays like Orange Bird who once again sits on his perch at the Sunshine Tree Terrace in Adventureland.



I love that theme park exclusive characters like Orange Bird are represented. Photo by Gregg Jacobs.

Orange Bird represented the Florida Orange Growers when the park first opened in 1971. He returned I think about 10 years ago to the park and has had growing popularity since. I'm glad to see him represented on park merchandise.

The fact that we like to see new characters doesn't mean we don't still love those that are older and more well known. That said sometimes it's fun to see them in a slightly new way and maybe one that personalizes it a bit.



Classic Disney characters can be depicted in a new way. Photo by Gregg Jacobs.

I love the above shirt that features Mickey Donald and Goofy. The artwork of them is a little different than we normally see and it has the saying “My Favorite Place with My Favorite People”. Perfect for a family reunion.

Along similar lines you can have a shirt that says “My Family is Incredible!”



This shirt is incredible! PPhoto by Gregg Jacobs.

Again great if you're traveling with family. Walking around the parks you see that people have gotten more and more creative in making their own shirts for family reunions vacations etc. I was at Target no less recently and they had shirts with mouse ears on the front that said things like “I'm the Grandpa” and “I'm the baby.” It's good to see Disney getting in on the action.

Despite the fun sayings and pictures I am happy to say that the classics still do endure.



The classics still endure and none is more classic than Mickey. Photo by Gregg Jacobs.

One of my favorites was the shirt with the classic standing Mickey Mouse and 1928 the year he was brought into the world.

Along those lines you might ask what my big T-shirt purchase was this trip. After all my talking about minor characters and funny sayings the shirt thought I bought simply said what I was feeling being there with my family.



Disney makes me “happy.” Photo by Gregg Jacobs.

The shirts aren't always cheap; the ones shown above range from $19.99 to $29.99—but they represent one of the basic souvenirs you can get at Disney Parks that you can actually use and enjoy. I'm glad to see Disney artists continuing to think outside the box and making these more fun and for everyone.

Outside of Disney’s Contemporary Resort the signs have already been replaced with ones for “Airport Shuttle Departures” referencing the upcharge Mears Connect service that will replace Magical Express.

Without it mentioning Mears or Magical Express this should hopefully reduce confusion for guests traveling to and from the airport over this next week.

The new sign can be found outside the main entrance canopy.

The final day of operation for Disney’s Magical Express will be Friday December 31 with Mears Connect taking over beginning January 1 2022. Reservations for the new service which range from $16.00 per adult for a one-way trip to $200 for premium service for up to four guests are now available.

Baltimore was missing countless key contributors on both sides of the ball but the team was still able to go toe-to-toe with future Hall-of-Fame quarterback Aaron Rodgers and company

One of the players who missed Week 15 with an injury was guard Ben Powers. the third-year guard out of the Unviersity of Oklahoma had been starting the majority of games at the position but his absence paved the way for rookie guard Ben Cleveland to make the first start of his NFL career. When veteran guard was asked about his thoughts on the performance of Cleveland in Week 15 the veteran had high praise for the young offensive lineman.

“He did great. Coming out there unexpectedly with [Ben] Powers going down he came in [and] he prepped hard all week. He’s a big strong man and he showed it out there this last Sunday.”

Selected in the third round of the 2021 draft Cleveland has been through a lot during his rookie season. He battled for the starting left guard spot was placed on injured reserve with an injury that cost him multiple weeks and now just made the first start of his NFL career. He played well overall and hopefully it’s a sign of things to come for the former University of Georgia star.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Until I was seven I had a goldfish called Algernon. He wasn’t the most exciting pet but I was quite upset when I found him floating one morning on the surface of his little tank. This or so I thought was the end of a short and uneventful existence.

But a few weeks ago I wrote a column about the failure to regulate waste disposal in the UK. It showed how millions of tonnes of waste some of it extremely hazardous are now being handled by organised criminal networks and illegally dumped or burned presenting major hazards to our health and to the living world. It showed how the Environment Agency in England and its equivalents in the rest of the UK have lost control to the extent that anyone can now get themselves officially licensed as a waste disposer using false information that can remain unchecked.

Some people found this hard to believe. But as chance would have it at that very moment the spirit of my dead goldfish spoke to me. With a clarity he had never exhibited in life he explained that he wished to be registered as an upper-tier carrier broker and dealer in waste. This would ensure that anyone paying him to dispose of waste materials could be confident that he had met the requisite standards and was not the kind of fishy operator who would take your money dump your waste illegally evade landfill tax and potentially land you the unwitting householder with a £5000 fine for failing to exercise your “duty of care”.

Perhaps motivated by a sense of guilt as I had neglected him in life I sought to fulfil his wishes. On the Environment Agency’s website I affirmed that he was a ahem sole trader and had no unspent convictions. I gave his name as Algernon Goldfish of 49 Fishtank Close Ohlooka Castle Derby and paid the requisite fee. It took less than four minutes. A month on my long-deceased goldfish remains on the register as a bona fide upper-tier waste dealer. If you want your rubbish safely removed no job too big or too small Algernon is your man. Or your fish.

Already in other words the system has fallen apart. The government says “We have pledged to reform the licensing system for waste carriers” but this has been going on for a long time and the situation is likely to get worse. Last month the Environment Agency circulated two memos to its managers. They explained that while reports of pollution illegal dumping and other kinds of damage are rising grants for incident management have been reduced in real terms “by 90% in 10 years”. The only events to which it can still respond are those it is specifically funded to investigate which means incidents at “regulated sites” (such as places handling radioactive waste certain kinds of illegal waste and those involved in flood control) and water companies.

The memos instructed staff to “not routinely spend time” on anything other than acute catastrophes caused by other businesses. Members of the public reporting incidents at unregulated sites should be “reassured that their report is useful to help us prioritise our work” and are effectively advised to take the law into their own hands by speaking directly to the perpetrator. The agency’s officers are then instructed to “shut down report”.

In other words unless you run a regulated site or are a water company you can do what you damn well like. Mind you as a constant stream of filth suggests if you are a water company or a regulated site you can also do what you damn well like. Everything is fishy now except our rivers.

There are two categories of crime in this country: those for which you can expect to be prosecuted and those for which you can’t. There’s no consistent connection between the seriousness of the crime and the likelihood of prosecution. Bag snatchers stealing a couple of hundred pounds a week are more likely to be caught and charged than fraudsters emptying the bank accounts of elderly people. Carrying a few grams of cannabis is more likely to land you in trouble than dumping hundreds of tonnes of hazardous waste.

On one estimate aside from the fake companies registered on the Environment Agency site there are more than 250000 unlicensed (in other words outright illegal) waste disposers in the UK. The number of con artists involved in ripping off vulnerable people and in white-collar fraud must also be high. According to the latest report by the auditors Crowe UK and the University of Portsmouth in 2020 fraud cost people and businesses in the UK £137bn. Their estimate has risen by 88% since 2007. Yet only 0.4% of fraud is believed to result in a criminal sanction.

Many tens of thousands of people are likely to be involved in the industrial-scale money laundering tax evasion shell companies corrupt practice and concealment of assets in the City of London and its satellites and the UK’s property market. Large numbers are running coercive labour rackets in farming car washes nail bars restaurants and other businesses. Altogether it would not be surprising if more than a million people in the UK were engaged in the kind of organised crime that seldom leads to prosecution.

This is what you get from 40 years of deregulation. While good citizens are bound by ever more oppressive laws “the market” according to neoliberal theory should be released from regulatory constraint. Deregulation is a euphemism for destroying the effective capacity of the state to protect us from chancers conmen and criminals. Empowered to cut corners fishy businesses outcompete responsible ones and we begin to shift towards an organised crime economy.

As crime syndicates extend their reach and expand their wealth they become politically powerful. Eventually mafias become embedded in public life. This is what happened in the US during prohibition. You can see it at work today in Russia Italy Mexico and Lebanon. There is no obvious mechanism to prevent it from happening here.

When Steve Bannon Donald Trump’s chief strategist announced that his aim was “the deconstruction of the administrative state” people were horrified. But in reality it has been happening for years on both sides of the Atlantic. It’s just that they do it subtly. Our government couldn’t simply close down the Environment Agency: people would be up in arms. Instead it hacks the budget and creates an institutional culture of demoralisation and failure. The same goes for the other regulatory bodies. Probity integrity trust? They sleep with the fishes.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vaW5zaWRlY2xpbWF0ZW5ld3Mub3JnL25ld3MvMjUxMjIwMjEvcGxhc3RpYy1wb2xsdXRpb24tZ2xvYmFsLXRyZWF0eS1uYWlyb2JpL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,World Talks on a Treaty to Control Plastic Pollution Are Set for Nairobi in February. How To Do So Is Still Up in the Air,"Governments are taking steps to rein in plastic waste.

But none of what’s been done so far has been up to the challenge of a growing plastics industry fed by consumer demand for more plastic products resulting in a deepening global plastic waste crisis.

As a result there is now an intensifying focus on the possibility of a global treaty to control plastic pollution.

The next milestone in a diplomatic process that began in 2014 could come in February in Nairobi Kenya when the U.N. Environmental Assembly meets to decide if it will endorse the beginning of official negotiations over a plastics treaty.

Those efforts may have received a boost in late November when Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced the Biden administration would join the talks. Blinken reversing a position from the Trump administration said the U.S. goal is to “create a tool that we can use to protect our oceans and all of the life that they sustain from growing global harms of plastic pollution.”

The chemical industry and environmental groups alike have welcomed U.S. engagement in formal treaty talks with environmental groups like Greenpeace citing the need for global solutions to a global problem and the chemical industry expressing hope that a treaty could help advance its vision of eliminating plastic waste. Separately the industry has opposed suggestions that there be a cap placed on plastic production.

In backing the treaty process Erin Simon head of plastic waste and business for World Wildlife Fund a conservation group that operates in 100 countries cited a 2020 Pew Charitable Trusts report that said without “immediate ambitious and concerted actions” the world by 2040 would see the annual flow of plastic into the ocean triple to about 29 million metric tons per year the equivalent of 2500 single-use plastic bottles for every meter of ocean beach.

“That would continue to obviously create huge impacts on species through entanglement ingestion and just messing up the ecosystems” Simon said. “It would continue to create issues for coastal communities and local fisheries” placing a significant toll on “public health and vulnerable communities in general who are already disproportionately impacted.”

Devil in the Details

Cities states and entire countries have banned single use plastics like grocery bags and straws. Some 187 nations though not the United States have agreed to restrict international trade in plastic scrap and waste. And Congress in November authorized $350 million for recycling and management of plastic waste including the first funding for the 2020 Save Our Seas 2.0 Act to boost research international cooperation ocean cleanup and waste management.

With a treaty the devil will be in the details and the hard work of getting enough countries to agree on the scope and provisions. Observers say the process could take years.

Conceptually the countries supporting a new plastic treaty seem to be dividing into two schools of thought said Björn Beeler the international coordinator for the International Pollutants Elimination Network (IPEN) comprised of more than 600 public interest nongovernmental organizations in 128 countries working to eliminate toxic pollutants.

One school of thought focuses on a “lifecycle” approach that would take into account the impacts of plastics from production to their use and disposal or recycling. It’s led by Rwanda and Peru with support from the European Union and could limit virgin plastic production and control the use of toxic chemicals that are added into plastic products Beeler said.

The other takes a “waste management” approach and would focus more narrowly on strategies to control plastic waste. This orientation has been defined under a draft resolution from Japan he said.

Environmentalists are pushing for restrictions on single use plastics like bags cutlery and straws making plastic producers responsible for plastic waste and enforceable national limits on the flow of plastics into the ocean.

Representatives of the pollutants elimination network said that to be effective any treaty also needs to ban toxic chemical additives in plastics. On Dec. 14 IPEN and another environmental organization seeking to fight plastics pollution International Pellet Watch released two reports that detailed the presence of chemicals found in plastic pellets spilled on beaches and recycled plastic pellets purchased from recycling facilities globally. The groups are working with partner organizations in 35 countries.

Health effects associated with the chemicals include cancer and hormonal effects that can lead to reproductive growth and cognitive impairment according to the reports.

“When you add chemicals to plastics they are not strongly attached” said Sara Brosché an IPEN science advisor and lead author of one of the reports. “So they can leach out. They will slowly move into the household dust” she said. When children put toys in their mouths she added “these chemicals can move out of plastic material” and dissolve in their saliva.

‘Bound up in the Health of Our Oceans’

It’s unclear what specifically the Biden administration wants out of a plastics treaty. But in making his announcement in November Blinken said countries will need to “develop and enforce strong national action plans to address this problem at its source. We recognize that different actors will have different capacities to act but every nation every community and indeed every individual has a role to play.”

He also said “the private sector in particular will need to do more.”

Human health and survival is “bound up in the health of our oceans” Blinken said adding that plastic is sickening and killing ocean animals. “And because plastics absorb toxins when we eat seafood we’re not only consuming microplastics but toxins as well” he said.

IPEN however is concerned that the United States one of the leading plastic producing nations in the world will side with an industry that emphasizes waste management and so-called “advanced” or “chemical” recycling. A National Academies of Sciences Engineering and Medicine report in November concluded that so far chemical or advanced recycling is limited to energy intensive processes used to make fuel or other chemical products rather than new plastics.

“If a treaty promotes waste management and subsidizes chemical recycling which is basically plastic fuels waste-to-energy or building up waste management facilities then you begin to subsidize with public funds the responsibility of the private sector that’s making this product” Beeler said.

Industry’s Nod

In the United States the plastics and chemical industries have fought state local and Congressional efforts to ban plastics or cap plastic production. But the American Chemistry Council a major lobbying arm of the chemical industry and one that Beeler described as a “powerful actor in this whole conversation” has given a nod to Blinken’s announcement that the United States would back efforts to work on a global treaty.

“We are supportive of a global agreement among nations that will accelerate a transition to a more circular economy by expanding systems and infrastructure to collect and repurpose plastic resources” said Joshua Baca the American Chemistry Council’s vice president of plastics in a written statement.

Baca said U.S. plastic makers the International Council of Chemical Associations and the World Plastics Council support a treaty framework with principles that include having all nations agree to eliminating plastic waste while providing flexibility to meet the needs of individual nations. They also want widespread access to waste collection along with “recognizing the role plastics play in a lower-carbon future.”

The industry argues that plastics actually reduce emissions blamed for causing global warming for example by making products lighter and easier to transport and because plastic packaging better keeps food fresh longer reducing food waste and methane emissions. For a more sustainable future the Plastics Industry Association says “we need more plastic not less”

The industry’s position on plastics and global warming however runs counter to recent studies that show plastics production and disposal from production to disposal are adding to global greenhouse gas emissions and will only get worse.

The Center for International Environmental Law working with the Environmental Integrity Project FracTracker Alliance and others in 2019 concluded that the plastics’ and petrochemical industries’ worldwide growth plans could make it impossible to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius the most challenging benchmark established under the 2015 Paris climate agreement.

The industry’s lifecycle emissions from natural gas extraction to plastics production and disposal was projected to rise to 1.34 billion metric tons per year by 2030 equivalent to the emissions from nearly 300 coal-fired power plants sized at 500-megawatts each the study found.

In October the group Beyond Plastics led by former regional EPA administrator Judith Enck published “The New Coal Plastics and Climate Change” which found that as coal plants close and petrochemical infrastructure expands in the United States the plastics industry’s contribution to climate change will exceed that of coal by 2030.

When the diplomats get together in February those from the United States may also find backing for strong action in the National Academies report which concluded that the United States the largest producer of plastic waste needs a comprehensive strategy by the end of 2022 to curb its devastating impacts on ocean health and marine wildlife. It offered several overarching recommendations including a national cap on the production of virgin plastic.

A Call for the Treaty

A mix of businesses some of which have been under withering pressure because of their use of single-use plastic packaging or bottles are joining the call for a treaty.

The World Wildlife Fund with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation and Boston Consulting Group in 2020 published a “Business Case for a UN Treaty on Plastic Pollution.” The report observed that “many companies are facing increased reputational risks” from their use of plastics threatening their customer bases as well as their ability to attract employees. The report also noted that it was “no longer a question of whether regulation is coming but what regulation is coming.”

Regulations already on the books vary so much from jurisdiction to jurisdiction—including bans against plastic bans—that it has become “increasingly difficult for businesses to navigate the maze of heterogeneous regulations at global national and even subnational levels” according to the report.

The three organizations have a “manifesto” now backed by dozens of businesses acknowledging that plastic “plays an important role in our lives and brings many benefits” but that “mounting evidence shows this problem will continue to grow unless we fundamentally rethink the way we produce use reuse and dispose of plastic.” So far about 90 companies have signed on including financial institutions producers retailers and brand owners such as Fidelity International Sodexo Coca Cola and Procter & Gamble.

There has also been a series of summits this year about a plastics treaty between activists and industry representatives organized by The Ocean Plastics Leadership Network a 90-member group assisted by World Wildlife Fund and Greenpeace that is working “not to achieve consensus but understanding and hopefully new ideas and collaborations” according to its website.

While a treaty could be years away Simon with the World Wildlife Fund said she expects there could be progress along the way in part because the process will further reveal the problems with plastic waste and potential solutions.

Because urgent action is needed she said “I’m going to be less caught up in how long it’s going to take and more about if the right topics are being discussed to signal the actions I need to see.”

The holidays give people a reason to gather with friends and family but they also turbo-boost waste material. Households in the United States increase the amount of trash they generate by 25% between Thanksgiving and New Year’s Day according to the Environmental Protection Agency.

Once the holiday cheer winds down of course all that waste has to go somewhere.

That’s why the City of San Antonio’s solid waste management department is reminding residents what can be recycled goes in the blue bin what can be composted goes in the organic green bin and what has to be thrown away goes into the brown trash bin. (Spoiler: wreaths can’t be composted if they contain florist wire.)

You can recycle the following clean items:

Paper mail. That includes catalogs flyers coupons and promotional postcards.

Cardboard boxes. Don’t forget to flatten out the box before recycling. Anything too large can be taken to one of the city’s four Bulky Drop-Off Centers.

Metal cans

Glass bottles

Plastic bottles and jugs

Boxes that contained dry goods

Packing peanuts

Cushion air pouches

Delivery envelopes with bubble wrap

Wrapping paper and seasonal cards made with foil or glitter

Items that can tangle such as ribbon or cords

Glass ornaments

Hard plastics such as toys or decorations

Clothing although if the clothes are still in good shape you can donate them to your favorite thrift store

Live wreaths and garlands held together with florist wire

Bones from meats like ribs

Compost via green bin:

Small live Christmas trees as long as they are cut up and do not keep the lid from closing. Large live trees are accepted at the city’s Brush Recycling Centers.

Flowers and decorative plants with the plastic or metal container and excess soil or rock removed.

Food and table scraps such as peels rinds husks nuts cores trimmings baked goods shells and cobs.

Food-soiled paper including pizza boxes coffee filters tea bags and paper to-go food packaging.

Nestlé Waters has selected Centre County Pennslyvania US as a potential location for a new $50m bottling facility.

The search for a new factory location was carried out under a collaboration between the company and the Chamber of Business and Industry of Centre County (CBICC) Centre County Industrial Development Corporation (CCIDC).

“A Nestlé Waters bottling facility would inject tens of millions of dollars into our local economy provide a substantial tax benefit and bring family-wage manufacturing jobs back to our communities.”

The company is considering building a new facility in order to cater to the increasing consumer demand for bottled water.

Said to be the company’s third bottling plant in Pennsylvania the proposed factory will bottle Deer Park 100% Natural Spring Water for customers across the Mid-Atlantic.

CBICC president and CEO Vern Squier said: “A Nestlé Waters bottling facility would inject tens of millions of dollars into our local economy provide a substantial tax benefit and bring family-wage manufacturing jobs back to our communities.

“The opportunity to bring a global leader in the food and beverage industry into Centre County is a win-win-win for our workforce our tax-base and for economic development.

Every year I’ve intended this list to highlight the beauty of the diversity across our state. I want kids here in Wisconsin to see role models of people who are succeeding to know that it’s possible for Black people to achieve great things here.

That’s exactly what our first five lists accomplished and what we hope to continue with this year’s list.

We can’t pretend though that this is just another year. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a dramatic impact on our communities for nearly two years now — our health and our jobs and our financial wellbeing and our education system and all of these effects are most pronounced in our Black communities. Add to that the brighter-than-ever spotlight on the injustice of systemic racism — it’s been a tough couple years for everybody but even more so for our Black communities.

Many have responded to this extraordinary time by expressing an authentic desire to learn more about Black people get to know Black communities celebrate Black excellence. That’s what this list is — and has always been — about. This list is no longer just a list. It is also an invitation — an invitation to engage to create to make Wisconsin a better place to attract and retain leaders of color.

We have never intended this list to be exhaustive. Obviously no list has been because we keep finding more and more dynamic leaders doing real work across the private public and nonprofit sectors. This list will however introduce you to some people you’ve never heard of who are doing great things in other parts of the state or simply working behind the scenes doing the work without the accolades.

It was important for us to expand the way we think about influence and to highlight more of the people doing what it takes to improve their community. That’s one reason this list is entirely new every year — we considered anyone named on previous lists to be ineligible for this one even though most of the people on past lists continue to wield considerable influence.

Over the next five days I hope you learn something you didn’t know about some of the real leaders in communities throughout Wisconsin and that we might be able to make some connections and start conversations that really move communities forward.

It was a wild year in the market as investors juggled ongoing pandemic recovery inflation monetary policy high valuations and geopolitical issues. There were certainly big winners and losers. Some of the largest stocks moved the market last year and they reveal important investment themes as we move into 2022.

1. Nvidia

Nvidia (NVDA 1.27%) is a semiconductor stock that grew into one of the biggest companies in the world this year. It's up more than 110% year to date. The company has been a leader in the gaming graphics processing unit (GPU) market for years but it is gaining traction in a wider variety of applications such as data centers for cloud computing artificial intelligence and robotics.

That appreciation was driven by excellent fundamentals as Nvidia delivered excellent results despite ongoing supply chain issues. The company's revenue is up 65% over the first nine months of its fiscal year and operating income has climbed 130%. Its forward price-to-earnings (PE) ratio has also doubled to 60 so investors should recognize the implication of buying stocks at that valuation level. Nvidia announced new products for gaming and cloud adding to its prospects. Massive tech investments by Meta Platforms (META 0.16%) and other businesses will also be a major catalyst in the coming years.

2. Alphabet

Alphabet (GOOGL -0.77%) marched steadily higher throughout the year to a 60% stock return. The company delivered roughly 45% sales growth over the first nine months of the year while operating profits increased 120%.

In a year where runaway valuations made headlines for tech stocks Alphabet delivered stellar returns based primarily on fundamentals rather than inflated valuation ratios. Its trailing PE ratio forward PE ratio and enterprise-value-to-EBITDA are all lower than one year ago though price-to-sales and price-to-book have risen slightly.

Alphabet is a major player in a few different growth markets but its sales and profits still come overwhelmingly from its advertising business. That concentration adds risk to the story but it's still oddly cheap for a tech stock with that growth profile.

3. Wells Fargo

Wells Fargo (WFC 1.00%) rode momentum in the financial sector and bank stocks earlier this year while good news in the second half of the year drove the stock more than 60% higher for the year.

Wells Fargo stock has lagged the Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF 0.38%) over the past five- and 10-year periods. The phony accounts scandal in 2016 was a big blow for the company. Things got worse in 2018 when regulators placed an asset cap on the bank limiting its scale until a number of operational and financial health issues were rectified. Wells Fargo is making good progress to improve its operational efficiency and meet the requirements to have its asset cap lifted.

Wells Fargo made progress this year but it's not out of the woods yet. Its dividend yield is only 1.21% today so it's hard to consider this stock cheap at this price.

4. Novo Nordisk

Pharmaceutical stock Novo Nordisk (NVO -0.19%) is up more than 55% this year. The company's sales grew 8% while profits rose 12%. Those are nice results but the stock's returns were driven primarily by valuation -- Novo Nordisk is more expensive based on multiple ratios. Its 1.37% dividend yield is the lowest since 2016.

It seems like investors are seeking safety in Novo Nordisk. The company leads the global diabetes medication market and it's gaining a strong foothold in obesity treatment. Novo Nordisk has a highly rated pipeline and it seems like a safe bet that this company will continue marching forward in the foreseeable future.

5. Home Depot

Home Depot (HD -0.29%) rode a wave of optimism 50% higher in 2021. Sales grew 16% over the first three quarters of the year driving operating income up nearly 30%. The stock's price rose relative to sales forward earnings and cash flow. Its dividend yield also sank around 60 basis points to 1.7%.

Investors are optimistic about consumer strength DIY popularity and homebuilding activity. Home Depot has certainly displayed strong operational performance but it might struggle to keep pace with investor expectations as interest rates rise.

Bonus stay-at-home stocks

This year was also characterized by the unwinding of the stay-at-home trade. Panic early in the pandemic eventually shifted to optimism as investors threw capital at stocks involved in remote activities including work healthcare exercise and shopping. Many stocks reached completely unsustainable valuations as uncertain conditions accelerated existing trends for remote collaboration.

That trend reversed in 2021 as things normalized and more rational valuations were demanded in the market. The charts of Peloton (PTON -5.61%) Teladoc Health (TDOC -2.37%) RingCentral (RNG -0.14%) and Zoom Video Communications (ZM 1.37%) are shockingly similar.

Those companies have all experienced their own challenges and successes but this is a clear case of market forces driving returns. Don't be shocked if this trend continues in 2022 regardless of the companies' earnings results.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3RvcGNsYXNzYWN0aW9ucy5jb20vbGF3c3VpdC1zZXR0bGVtZW50cy9tb25leS9iYW5raW5nLW5ld3MvYWxseS1jbGFzcy1hY3Rpb24tYWxsZWdlcy1iYW5rLWRlbmllcy1hY2NvdW50cy10by1ub24tdXMtY2l0aXplbnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ally Class Action Alleges Bank Denies Accounts to Non-US Citizens,"Top Class Actions’s website and social media posts use affiliate links.

Ally Bank Account Denial Class Action Lawsuit Overview:

Who: A woman who was brought to the United States as a child and is allowed to work under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program is suing Ally Bank.

Why: The woman says the bank denied her an account because she is not a U.S. citizen or legal permanent resident in violation of the law.

Where: The class action lawsuit was filed in a California federal court.

Ally Bank illegally denies non-United States residents access to bank accounts even if they are legally allowed to work in the country a new class action lawsuit alleges.

Plaintiff Mariela Aguilar Velazquez filed the class action complaint against Ally Bank Dec. 20 in a California federal court alleging violations of the Civil Rights Act and California Civil Code.

Aguilar is a recipient of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.

DACA is a policy that allows immigrants who were brought to the United States as children to receive a renewable two-year period of deferred action from deportation and become eligible for a work permit in the U.S.

Aguilar has had authorization to work in the United States and a Social Security Number since 2012. However in Nov. 2020 she says when she went to open a checking and savings account with Ally Bank she was unlawfully denied.

“Plaintiff Aguilar received a phone call from an Ally Bank representative informing Plaintiff Aguilar that she is ineligible to open a checking and savings account with Ally Bank because she is not a U.S. citizen or an Legal Permanent Resident” the lawsuit says. “Plaintiff Aguilar asked the representative whether this denial was allowed by law. The representative answered that it is Ally Bank’s policy to deny anyone who is not a U.S. citizen or permanent resident.”

Plaintiff Claims No Other Bank Denied Her An Account Because Of Immigration Status

Aguilar is alleging unlawful discrimination on the basis of alienage in violation of the Civil Rights Act and the Unruh Civil Rights Act as codified at California Civil Code. She said no other bank has denied her a bank account because of her immigration status.

“Plaintiff Aguilar suffered harm as a result of Ally Bank’s denial of her checking and savings account application because of her alienage” the lawsuit states. “Ally Bank’s denial of her application caused Plaintiff Aguilar to suffer emotional distress.”

She’s seeking to represent anyone in the United States who was denied a bank account from Ally Bank on the basis of alienage plus a California class.

She’s seeking certification of the class action an injunction damages fees costs and a jury trial.

In 2020 Wells Fargo agreed to pay a $20 million settlement to DACA recipients whose loan applications were denied by Wells Fargo.

The plaintiffs are represented by Deylin O. Thrift-Viveros of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund.

The songs are timeless the casting contemporary and dance routines still daring.

But for social scientists like us Steven Spielberg’s remake of the 1961 hit musical West Side Story—a film about two rival street gangs—is more than a 21st-century face-lift of a Broadway classic. Released in theaters on Dec. 10 2021 it is an opportunity to consider societal changes in the six decades since Maria and Tony stole the hearts of audiences across the world—particularly in the world of gangs.

As scholars who have studied gang culture we find that the soul of the street gang hasn’t changed much since the days of the Jets and the Sharks—but the world around them has. Demographics economics technology and public policy have reshaped and reshuffled gang life in America. So dramatic are the changes that the romanticized West Side Story characterization of gangs is now a relic of a bygone era.

Evolving demographics

Perhaps the biggest shift in gangs is skin-deep—urban white-ethnic neighborhood-based gangs like the Jets no longer really exist.

At the top of the page: Dancing with danger (West Side Story/Amblin). Above: A lot has changed about gang life since Leonard Bernstein seen above at its opening at the National Theater Washington DC August 12 1957 created West Side Story (Library of Congress).

Ethnonational conflict among Italian Irish Jewish and Polish youth in cities like Boston Chicago New York and Philadelphia culminated with the end of mass migration from Europe in the early to mid-20th century. Many urban white people moved to the suburbs in the 1960s and generally speaking took their gangs with them. Today when people think of the American street gang they are more likely to think of Black gangs like the Bloods and Crips or Latino gangs like the Nortenos and Surenos. White street gangs are located outside of urban areas and cast as domestic extremists such as the Proud Boys Three Percenters and Skinheads.

The gang as an American enterprise

The gangs of the West Side Story era were often a normal yet fleeting aspect of adolescence soon to be supplanted by work marriage and children.

But in the 1970s and 1980s globalization and industrial restructuring caused the well-paying stable blue-collar jobs that young men in gangs were qualified for to largely disappear. Around this same time gang involvement became more prolonged into adulthood and intergenerational within families.

This era also coincided with an increase in imported drugs such as heroin and crack cocaine. With the rise of the illicit drug economy the gang itself became an institutionalized route to mythologized riches. Gang activity expanded throughout the country emerging in the suburbs and even rural towns leading to the most recent estimates from the National Gang Center of 31000 gangs and 850000 gang members.

The West Side goes digital

Gang life saw more changes with the emergence of the internet. The internet and social media were in the realms of far-fetched fantasy when West Side Story was made but they now provide a repository for gang content a blueprint for gang activity and a catalyst for gang conflict. A modern West Side Story would entail taunts on Twitter fights over Facebook and reliving the rumble on Reddit.

Word always traveled fast on the streets; West Side Story shows that well. But social media makes it faster more public and more permanent. Gossip taunts and threats are now broadcast to a much bigger social world—in some cases with violent consequences.

Gang violence becomes deadlier

Contemporary gangs “shoot it out” rather than “slug it out.” In the 1960s there were several hundred gang homicides annually; now there are several thousand.

When compared with other homicides gang-related homicides disproportionately involve the use of firearms. Firearms are far more prevalent and accessible now than when West Side Story was conceived. But what original West Side Story director and choreographer Jerome Robbins understood back in the 1950s still holds true: When guns and knives are present pushing and shoving can escalate quickly into stabbing and shooting. The movie’s fateful knife fight dramatically illustrates this.

Gangs are a criminal justice priority

As gangs and violence proliferated in the decades after West Side Story first hit screens the cure for the Jets’ self-diagnosis of “sociological sickness” has shifted from social work to suppression. Criminal justice is now the rule of the day. Beat police officers like Officer Krupke and Lt. Shrank have been replaced by gang unit officers and special investigators tasked with gathering intelligence and documenting and collating gang members in databases.

The soul of the street gang hasn’t changed much since the days of the Jets and the Sharks—but the world around them has. Demographics economics technology and public policy have reshaped and reshuffled gang life in America. So dramatic are the changes that the romanticized West Side Story characterization of gangs is now a relic of a bygone era.

States also responded legislatively to gangs. California first passed its anti-gang laws in 1988 and 44 states have since followed suit. Gang membership and recruitment have been criminalized while sentencing enhancements for crimes with a gang nexus have been controversially introduced.

In the days of West Side Story gangs were not a significant issue in prisons. Since the onset of mass incarceration in the 1970s prisons have become a vector for gang activity—around 15% of U.S. prisoners today are affiliated with gangs.

American street gangs in the 21st century

It is impossible to understand gangs in the 21st century without considering how the world around them has shifted. And while structural shifts in policy population and technology clearly matter what is perhaps the starkest change has little to do with the gangs themselves but the way in which the general public and the legal system stigmatize the children within them. The average age of a gang member is 15—these are kids who are trying to survive in the worst of circumstances.

If the gang was a rite of passage when Riff and Bernardo roamed the streets of New York City in West Side Story the reality of the contemporary gang has become much bleaker because of worsening violence mass incarceration and other factors that have operated largely outside of their control.

West Side Story harks back to simpler times with less polarization and violence. Perhaps it could also assist in revising what we know about gangs and reforming some of our more punitive impulses to respond to them.

About SoLo Funds

SoLo Funds is a mobile lending exchange that connects lenders and borrowers for the purpose of providing more affordable access to loans under $1000.

SoLo was created to disintermediate the predatory payday lending system. Today SoLo is one of the fastest growing fintech companies in the country.

The predatory payday lending system is a problem that affects many people. These lenders prey on people who are in a tight spot and need cash fast.

They charge high interest rates and fees which can make it very difficult for people to repay their loans. This can lead to a cycle of debt that can be very difficult to break out of.

SoLo’s story starts the way every SoLo request begins: with someone needing a hand.

Co-founders Travis Holoway & Rodney Williams were noticing that family members friends and roommates were asking for financial help here and there and they understood why.

There weren’t any fair reputable options for small short-term loans.

They decided to create one by harnessing the power of community. SoLo was formed in 2018 to create a viable non-predatory option for moments when life happens.

SoLo tap’s into the power of community and generosity to form an online safety net that is mutually beneficial to all of its members.

Travis and Rodney know that SoLo is needed because they needed it. Our loved ones needed it. And they know that SoLo makes a difference because nearly 80% of Americans live paycheck to paycheck.

Today SoLo is driven to new heights but grounded in the same hope and mission: to build a community that enables financial autonomy for all.

Predatory Payday Lending Practices

Predatory payday lending practices are a growing problem in the United States. These practices can trap vulnerable individuals in cycles of debt and lead to long-term financial instability.

It is vital that you understand how these practices work so that you can protect yourself from becoming a victim. Let’s take a look at what predatory payday lending looks like and how it affects borrowers.

Predatory payday lenders offer short-term loans at high interest rates often with exorbitant fees and hidden charges that may not be disclosed to the borrower until after they have signed the loan contract.

This type of lender does not carefully assess the borrower’s ability to repay the loan which often leads to borrowers taking out multiple loans in order to pay back the original loan.

The combination of extremely high interest rates and excessive fees quickly compounds trapping borrowers in an endless cycle of debt while lining the pockets of predatory lenders.

The Impact on Borrowers

Unfortunately this cycle of debt can have serious consequences for those who find themselves stuck in it. In addition to skyrocketing expenses these individuals are often deprived of access to other mainstream credit sources due to their inability to pay off their existing debts.

This lack of access can create further economic instability as well as limit their ability to purchase important needs such as medical care or housing.

The high costs associated with predatory lending can also have serious implications for an individual’s credit score which can prevent them from ever getting out from under their debt burden.

About Rodney Williams

Rodney has been recognized with numerous awards including Ad Age’s 40 Under 40 in 2012; the Ernst & Young EDGE Award in 2013; Cannes Gold Lion award in 2015; Tech Entrepreneur of the Year by Black Enterprise 2016; NAACP Inspiring Innovation list 2017; 25 Inspiring Entrepreneurs Under 40 by Entrepreneur Magazine 2016; Entrepreneur of the Year in Connected World Communications in the Ohio Valley Region by EY in 2017; Ebony’s Power 100 in 2018 and CNBC Disruptor 50 List in 2015 2016 2018 and 2019.

Rodney attended West Virginia University where he earned his BBA in finance his BA in economics and his MS in integrated marketing communications.

Rodney also holds an MBA in finance & supply chain management from Howard University. He is a member of the 2019 Class of Henry Crown Fellows within the Aspen Global Leadership Network at the Aspen Institute.

How would you characterise the health of the captive insurance market in Bermuda?

If you ask a panel of captive insurance experts for their views on the industry in Bermuda you are likely to get different responses. But when they come together a clearer picture emerges.

Half a dozen Bermuda captive industry experts were polled by Bermuda Finance 2021/2022 Magazine.

These are a couple of the magazine’s questions and the answers provided by the panel.

The six industry experts are Paul Bailie head of offshore Americas Insurance Management Willis Towers Watson; Matt Carr partner Appleby; David Gibbons partner PwC Bermuda; Séadna Kirwan risk advisory director Aon; Michael Parrish senior vice-president and client services leader Marsh; and Brian Quinn chief executive officer Granite Management.

They were asked how they would characterise the health of the captives market in Bermuda.

Brian Quinn: “Granite Management is a small independent captive manager but our real focus is employee benefit consulting.

“We’ve seen a big uptick in interest in bringing employee benefits into captives over the past 18 months to the point where we’ve nearly doubled the amount of premium under management for our captive insurance clients.”

Michael Parrish: “I’m head of the client service group for Marsh Bermuda across captives commercials long-term sector and ILS. We have been very busy both with existing clients increasing the use of captives and with new business.

“We’ve added four new captives this year. There’s a lot of interest but that doesn’t always translate into new captives. But there’s certainly a lot more being done by captives already here. The market is good it’s busy. Bermuda is still doing well. The BMA has been very responsive through the pandemic.

“I don’t think the island has really suffered too much in this segment. Obviously there’s a bit of economic uncertainty on the island generally but that relates more to hospitality not so much international business which is very strong. It’s business as usual. I don’t think there’s been too much change.”

Paul Bailie: “Things are pretty busy at the moment. The wider commercial insurance markets have been difficult with rates increasing and we’re seeing increased activity in the captives segment as a result. In particular some of our existing clients are doing more than they were say two years ago but we are seeing new captives as well.”

What are the forces driving new formations?

Paul Bailie: “In terms of people coming to Bermuda I’m not sure the dynamics have changed massively. Our regulatory environment remains the attraction. We’re still a good home for larger more complex captives. In terms of the expertise on the island we’re probably ahead of some of our competitors.

“The bigger more complex accounts that want international programmes tend to come here. Perhaps companies that write purely domestic business in the US are more onshore now and there’s a lot of competition for that type of business.

“But we are still seeing growth in the complex and the global and in areas that are maybe a little newer where people are doing more innovative things for example around climate change and cyber as well as lines where there have been perennial challenges such as directors and officers liability.

“Hard market conditions in the wider markets have probably driven interest and people are being a little more aggressive about how they approach the particular barriers to form a captive programme. The numbers of start-ups isn’t massively overwhelming but we are also seeing segregated account companies – cells. That’s definitely an area where there is growth driven by hard market conditions.

“Some companies are taking a more holistic view to their use of capital to help them better manage capital and risk financing. Perhaps previously they have not used their captive as extensively as they might.”

Michael Parrish: “There are clear challenges in market conditions. Marsh Global Placement gives a summary of the growth in composite insurance pricing quarter on quarter. Interestingly it looks like increases in rates peaked in quarter four 2020 at 22 per cent.

“Throughout all of 2020 it rose 14 per cent 19 per cent 20 per cent and 22 per cent respectively. This year prices increased in the first quarter 18 per cent and in the second quarter 15 per cent.

“So while prices are still going up and the market is still very challenging it does look like the peak of the market was last year and that it’s starting to stabilise. These are averages across all lines. In certain cases such as cyber and D&O and professional lines the increases would have been vastly more.

“It is clear there are certain lines of business which have been very challenging for buyers and in those cases they tend to look at captives.

“The number of captives managing cyber-risk in some form increased 54 per cent over the same period. Medical stop-loss increased 81 per cent.

“These are risks captives really weren’t involved in a decade ago. There are a lot of new programmes being written by captives as a result of challenging market conditions. When the commercial market is difficult expensive companies will look at alternatives and the most common alternative is a captive.

“The gross written premium in captives under our management went up in 2020. Again that occurs as the market hardens as the market becomes more challenging. That is evidence that market conditions impact captive growth not necessarily in terms of new formations but certainly in terms of the increased usage of captives.”

Séadna Kirwan: “The hard market definitely prompted a broader look at what captives could be used for; in a number of cases they had no choice. The mindset within organisations was when the market was very soft some felt that they never chased rates right to the very bottom and they had some loyalty to their carriers. But they didn’t feel that loyalty was rewarded when the hard market came.

“In some cases the long-term relationships that they have historically had with carriers have been severely and potentially irreparably damaged.

“They are looking into the captive now thinking we actually have control of this over the long term. It’s a much more holistic strategic look at the captive trying to remove that reliance on the external market so that they don’t have to follow those peaks and troughs.

“People are setting budgets for the next 12 months and getting a 20 per cent premium next June that’s not in their budget is very hard to manage.

“That is changing the underlying behaviour of captive owners and of the large corporates utilising them.”

MattCarr: “We hear from our clients that they’re expecting to see some continued hardening of rates for the foreseeable future.

“That may be a driver for continued activity in the Bermuda captive insurance market and we are seeing further conversations and discussions many around emerging risk areas for example digital asset risks and cyber.

“These are exciting discussions for us as practitioners but also for Bermuda as a leading captive insurance domicile.”

Brian Quinn: “Our main focus is on employee benefits outsourced underwriting and management for captives in multiple domiciles including Bermuda and we have doubled our premium under management in the last year.

“A lot of the reasons for the increased interest in captives have been covered already but once companies start assessing they are looking at how to use their captives in other ways because they’ve been forced to reconsider their captive strategy due to the hardening market.

“I have many discussions with clients and potential clients asking me about using their captive to cover multiple different risks. This is not our focus but there’s a lot of interest because the market has made them reconsider. I have seen a lot more interest in setting up captives but also using cell captives structures to facilitate easy access to a captive solution.

“There is obviously an appetite for new captives out there and people are expanding those captives. In the soft market we had for probably well over a decade people weren’t using their captives as efficiently as they should have and now they’re refocusing.

David Gibbons: “A lot of companies are more focused on risk than they have been before. The chief risk officer’s voice around the C-suite is being heard more. Therefore you find people looking at their captive and the best ways to utilise it to mitigate risk.

“It’s not only the pricing component it’s also the impact of culture and the way people are looking at risk now.

“Further as business environments and risks change supply chain management and business interruption are more of an issue in the new dynamic of the world.

“That is where we’re seeing a lot of discussion on how you can change what your captive is doing and cover not just the pricing and limits but the new way we’re working in this environment.”

The entire round-table discussion can be found in Bermuda Finance 2021/22.

Las Vegas has been advertising itself as the sports and entertainment capital of the world with a perfect mix of the two found in the north end zone of Allegiant Stadium.

That’s where you’ll find the Wynn Field Club an only-in-Las-Vegas stadium feature boasting a full-fledged nightclub at field level. The club made possible by a founding partnership deal between Wynn Las Vegas and stadium officials and the Raiders is open for all Raiders home games and other select Allegiant Stadium events that boast a large capacity.

The 10691-square-foot space was designed by Allegiant Stadium architect David Manica and features 29 booths 18 dining tables four bars dual DJ booths 39 televisions and a large LED screen to catch the action inside and out. The space can fit 719 guests.

Club General Manager Hunter Beaty is a veteran of the Las Vegas nightlife industry who said the focus is making the facility live up to the standards of the popular XS and Encore Beach Club locations under the Wynn Nightlife umbrella.

“Everything as far as before and after the game is what we do but obviously when the football game is going on the centerpiece of the stadium is the football game” Beaty said.

“We want to make sure that our guests get a chance to see the game but we want to offer them something that might be a little bit before or after. This is something not seen anywhere else in the country. Other places have nightclubs in their venues but they’re often up in the rafters. They’re not the length of the end zone at field level.”

Club experience

The club has a dedicated entrance on the east side of the stadium allowing patrons to skip the madness at the main gates. Wynn also offers customers who have table reservations at the club transportation between the stadium and the casino.

Fans in the club have routinely become part of the action when the Raiders score a touchdown in the end zone most notably in Week 1 when Derek Carr connected with Zay Jones for the winning touchdown on “Monday Night Football.”

Multiple Raiders were mobbed by fans as they leaped onto the wall bordering the club with the rest of the team running over to join in the celebration.

“The first game of the season couldn’t have worked out any better for us” Beaty said. “The game-winning touchdown scored by Zay Jones then he literally runs across the entire venue with our fans within inches of him. … We’ve had a lot of that and it’s been really exciting.”

Patrons can gain access to the club either by purchasing general admission access or by making table reservations.

Prices for both vary with NFL games this season ranging from $500 to $750 depending on the game. That gets the customer into the stadium and the Wynn Field Club and access to the standing room-only spaces that offer some of the best views of the game.

Then there are the more costly table reservations that come with a minimum spend by those who choose the elevated experience.

The minimum varies by event and table location with tables able to host from 10 to 15 people. For the Garth Brooks concert in July Wynn Field Club listed minimum purchases for tables as between $2000 and $15000 before fees and gratuity. The price for the $15000 minimum-spend table in the front row jumped to $20578 when a venue fee gratuity and sales tax were added in.

“For concerts it might be a little bit lower. For Raider games it’s obviously our peak business but it really just depends on the event” Beaty said.

Dining options

Clubbers also have an array of food options available to them ranging from the game day menu that features almost two dozen items including Charlie’s Famous Pretzel ($19) chicken tenders ($22) and Baja blackened shrimp tacos ($26).

Then there’s the table service menu that must be ordered five days in advance of an event. That premium menu includes offerings such as a tiered shellfish tower that serves four people ($260) and Black Gold a 250-gram serving of Kolikoff golden osetra caviar ($1500) that serves from six to eight people.

“Part of this deal was we wanted to be as Wynn as possible so the Wynn culinary team from the hotel takes care of all the food and beverage inside the venue” Beaty said.

Mixing of fans

During the Dec. 5 game against Washington fans in the club could be heard boasting about having “the best seats in the house.” One clubgoer rooting for Washington suggested that all Raiders games be converted to home games so every fan base could experience the club and the stadium.

No matter who the customer is cheering for during the game the bottom line is they have been taking to the unique stadium space with enthusiasm.

“The biggest takeaway we have so far is that people love to be in the space from start to finish” Beaty said. “If you come at halftime we have a line out the door and we tend to hit capacity at every single game.”

Star power

Various celebrities have joined in the action in the club including former Raider Darren McFadden rapper Lil Jon former NFL star Chad Ochocinco Chumlee of “Pawn Stars” fame and UFC fighters like Jose Aldo and Alexander Volkanovski.

Superstar DJs like Marshmello and Diplo also routinely make appearances with Diplo playing an hour set at the after party of the Dec. 5 game.

“It’s a cool environment after the game” Beaty said. “You’re either celebrating or you’re drinking your sorrows away from your team losing. Either way we have fans from both teams hanging around after the game enjoying the music.”

Any fan with a ticket to the game can attend the after party provided the club hasn’t reached its capacity.

...

In only the past week the NHL announced that its players would not participate in the Olympics the United States-Canada women's hockey exhibition game at Xcel Energy Center was canceled and Wolves forward Karl-Anthony Towns and Vikings running back Dalvin Cook were ruled out for their upcoming games.

These are all COVID-related decisions that have affected the local sports scene. The surging omicron variant is cutting a swath through the sports world.

But what's interesting — or perplexing or troubling — is how professional sports leagues are now all over the spectrum of virus management with their health and safety protocols. Times have changed since March 2020 when sports leagues were unified with safety measures at the outset of the COVID-19 outbreak.

Here's a brief rundown of how some leagues are handling the pandemic:

Football: Infected? Vaccinated? No problem. Suit up.

Basketball: We're not shutting down! Sign replacement players! Who cares if Joe Johnson is 40 years old? Lace 'em up.

English Premier League soccer teams: This is madness! We need to shut down the league in the name of safety. The league: No.

Hockey: Pause the season! Go home for Christmas. Don't get infected Wild and Blues players we need the Winter Classic to go on!

Who's right? Who's wrong? Who's walking a fine line between what's practical and what's plausible? One would think that sports leagues would compare notes or commissioner-source some ideas on how to proceed safely even if each sport has its own particular set of challenges.

The NHL has postponed 64 games after outbreaks among various teams — which reflects an abundance of caution. The NBA and Premier League have postponed games as well but each league appears determined to navigate through the blizzard of infections. The NBA is looking to reduce the number of days an infected player has to quarantine a reasonable approach based on data.

The NFL has determined that if a player's viral load is at a certain level he's infected but not contagious and can play. Also vaccinated players don't have to be tested unless they (wink wink) self-report symptoms.

If you or I get sick we're asked to isolate for 10 days.

Once again the NFL is brandishing its shield and stopping at nothing to ensure its multi-billion-dollar machine operates at full throttle. Meanwhile Texas A&M and Hawaii pulled out of bowl games because of positive tests transfers and other developments.

Sports' place in society is unquestioned. We all want to watch and opine about the games. But the games should be played with health and safety a priority as we ride out the pandemic. Not all leagues appear to be doing so.

Big Ten test ahead

After the New Year we'll find out exactly what the Gophers men's basketball team is made of when it runs into the Big Ten portion of the schedule.

But you have to like what you have seen so far.

After last year's team took way too many three-pointers — making just 28.4% of them — this group is sinking 36.5% from behind the arc.

Despite the new faces this team takes care of the ball — except for the 28-turnover outbreak against Texas A&M-Corpus Christi.

The Gophers play pretty good defense and have been tough on the perimeter holding opponents to 24.8% shooting on three-pointers.

Are these sustainable traits or numbers that will wither in the pressure cooker that is Big Ten basketball? Will a lack of size catch up with them? That remains to be seen. But these Gophers make you want to tune in to see where this goes.

Twins' Followell exits satisfied

Vern Followell was hired as an area scout by then-Twins scouting director Larry Corrigan before the 1989 season. Two seasons later he was part of a World Series-winning organization. Followell thought he was at the right place at the right time — he just wished there had been a couple more trophies along the way.

Back in the days of the 3½-inch floppy disks Followell helped develop a system into which scouts could feed their reports a precursor to modern databases. He eventually moved into pro scouting and was widely respected throughout the league.

Now Followell 64 is retiring after spending his entire career with the Twins.

""I feel lucky about that"" Followell said. ""We had some great times and fought through some things. I probably will miss the guys talking about it arguing about it. [But] it's a good time for me to go.""

... AND TWO PREDICTIONS ...

Cook's absence too much

The Vikings already faced a daunting task on Sunday in trying to stop Cooper Kupp Aaron Donald and the Rams. With Dalvin Cook out it makes it even tougher. Rams win 30-20.

They'll be great outdoors

A Wild team excited to play an outdoors hockey game at Target Field will dominate the Winter Classic from start to finish and down St. Louis 5-2 to start the new year on a winning note.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJyYWluZXJkZGlzcGF0Y2guY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9ob2NrZXktdHdvLWJyYWluZXJkLWJyb3RoZXJzLXNoYXJlLWljZS1hcy1vZmZpY2lhbHPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hockey: Two Brainerd brothers share ice as officials,"Whatever sibling rivalry Morgan and Bronson Shepherd have they don’t show it come game time.

Morgan 36 and Bronson 32 are both hockey officials from the lakes area and a part of the Central Lakes Hockey Referee Association. They also referee college games in the Wisconsin Intercollegiate Athletic Conference.

“It’s very helpful” Morgan said of working with his brother. “I’d say being the older brother we’ve had our battles on the ice but I think we both know each other and want to do a good job. I think we both understand how each other sees a game and it clicks.”

There are two different types of officials in hockey. The referee wears orange sleeves and calls penalties and does line changes. The linesman doesn’t wear orange and calls offsides initiates face-offs and icing but doesn’t call penalties.

On Dec. 9 the two brothers worked together at Essentia Health Sports Center when the Brainerd Warriors hosted the Northern Lakes Lightning in boys hockey. Morgan was the referee and Bronson was the linesman.

“It’s an absolute blast” Bronson said of working with his brother. “He’s kind of the main reason I got into reffing. He’s a huge mentor to me and how I’ve grown as an official. We give each other feedback and I think we see the game in a similar way so it makes things go pretty well and it’s fun to travel with him.”

Morgan was a 2004 Brainerd High School graduate who played on the hockey team and Bronson was a 2008 Brainerd graduate who also played hockey.

Morgan got started officiating after his playing days were over in 2012.

“I just wanted to stay involved in the game” Morgan said. “I’d been playing hockey since I was four or five years old. Played high school junior and college hockey and when I got done I didn’t like mentally playing still after college and wanted to stay in the game.”

Morgan now serves on the board of the Central Lakes Hockey Referee Association.

Bronson started officiating when he lived in the Twin Cities. When he moved back to the lakes area last year he joined the Central Lakes Hockey Referee Association which just started and the two brothers started doing games together.

“I played hockey at Brainerd and at Concordia-Moorhead and (refereeing) was a way to get back into the game” Bronson said. “My brother Morgan was officiating and he kind of pushed me to do it and it’s been fun. I started doing squirts and now I’m doing college so it’s been a fun ride.”

Both Morgan and Bronson have found working games together has made their relationship stronger.

“Spending time with my brother in the car on the way to games and just talking about the game and just being together really” Morgan said. “If we didn’t ref we probably wouldn’t spend that much time together so it’s good to be a part of the game and work with my brother.”

Bronson added: “We talk on the phone like if we don’t do a game together he’s the first person I call when I get into the car. When he typically doesn’t have a game he’ll watch my game and if I don’t have a game I typically watch his game. We talk hockey a ton and that shows how much we care and how good of a job we want to do. Our relationship has really grown and it’s fun to share a hobby with your brother.”

Morgan said he typically refs two to three high school games a week and four to 10 youth hockey games a week. Typically Bronson and Morgan are paired up for two games a week.

For their day jobs Morgan works at Bernick’s and Bronson works at Takedown Gym.

Morgan has refereed two state tournaments in his nine years officiating — one girls and one boys. He also worked the U15 National Tournament in Dallas last year for USA hockey.

“You go to all these small rinks and do these big games at small rinks but you get in front of the Xcel Energy Center and one of the games I had was 19000 fans for a state semifinal game. It was pretty cool” Morgan said.

Bronson has officiated section finals but hopes to get to the state tournament this year.

Both Bronson and Morgan said they’ve heard their fair share of hecklers from parents and fans. The key is blocking it out of their mind during a game.

“That’s part of the game and part of growing and mentoring officials” Morgan said. “It’s not for everyone and the biggest thing is blocking that out. Sometimes you can’t block it and things need to be done but there are a lot of crazies out there.”

Bronson added: “That’s why I think officiating is tough on the younger officials and it’s tough to retain officials and grow areas to actually have games going on. I’ve heard a lot and it is one of those things that as you grow up as an official you tune those things out.”

Morgan serves on the board of the Central Lakes Hockey Referee Association and loves seeing younger referees involved.

“It’s rewarding to work with younger officials and see them grow” Morgan said. “Their confidence level when they go on the ice from calling their first penalty to calling their 100th penalty. And just seeing the confidence build.”

PAUL Minn. – Anxiety swept through the Buffalo Sabres ahead of their game Tuesday in Winnipeg as news spread about a rash of Covid-19 cases across the National Hockey League and professional sports.

Two specific cases struck a nerve with the Sabres before their first road game in Canada since March 3 2020. Carolina Hurricanes rookie forward Seth Jarvis and a team trainer tested positive for the virus while in Vancouver and according to Canadian law were supposed to quarantine there for 14 days. The Hurricanes quickly scrambled to ensure their safe lawful passage by emergency ambulance to Seattle where they boarded a charter flight home.

Observations: Sabres ground Jets behind the work of Dahlin and Luukkonen Dahlin notched the first two-goal game of his career and Luukkonen rang up 34 more saves as the Sabres grounded the Winnipeg Jets 4-2 in Canada Life Centre.

“I’m not going to lie; yesterday was really stressful” Sabres alternate captain Kyle Okposo said following practice Wednesday in Xcel Energy Center. “The last couple days were with the thought of possibly getting stuck in Canada for Christmas. That was on a lot of guys’ minds and it was something that was definitely talked about. … That’s just a life thing where it would be tough to explain to my kids that I can’t be there for Christmas.”

While the Sabres escaped Winnipeg with a 4-2 victory and zero positive Covid-19 tests more than two dozen cases across the league over a two-day span caused the NHL and NHLPA to implement enhanced health and safety protocols through at least Jan. 7.

The league will institute daily testing instead of once every 72 hours masks must be worn at facilities meetings will be held virtually players are barred from dining indoors on the road and everyone is asked to limit social interactions outside of the hotel rink or home. Essentially the players are temporarily back in the same bubble-like environment that kept them isolated on the road last season. The NHL could extend the protocols though.

“It’s concerning” Sabres coach Don Granato said. “Obviously saying that it’s been concerning since the inception of the pandemic and it’s no different. I’ve said it many times it’s such an elusive thing. You can never be too safe. … When you hear about this it does shake you a little bit because it feels that everyone is taking it very serious and you have it not stopping.”

Tyler Bertuzzi of the Detroit Red Wings is the NHL’s only unvaccinated player yet the league has been dealing with Covid-19 cases since the season began in October. Since the start of the season the NHL has postponed 10 games because of cases on four teams: Calgary Carolina Ottawa and the New York Islanders.

But the NHL is now dealing with an outbreak unlike any it has seen since the 56-game 2020-21 season. On Wednesday 17 members of the Flames including 63-year-old coach Darryl Sutter entered Covid-19 protocol. The Boston Bruins had three players deemed unavailable: Brad Marchand Patrice Bergeron and David Pastrnak. Nashville coach John Hynes two assistant coaches and six players entered protocol. Five Florida Panthers are the latest added to the list.

The Hurricanes had four additional players enter protocol causing the postponement of their game Tuesday night in Minnesota. The NHL NHLPA and their doctors held conference calls in response to the increase of cases. And now it’s unclear whether the league’s players will follow through on their plan to attend the Winter Olympics in China in February.

The Sabres have undergone daily testing since goalie Dustin Tokarski tested positive for Covid-19 ahead of a road game against the Panthers and entered protocol Dec. 1. Tokarski experienced symptoms while quarantining in Florida passed the mandatory cardiac testing and is in Buffalo working his way back into game shape. The Sabres’ American Hockey League affiliate in Rochester had four games postponed when coach Seth Appert and assistant coach Mike Weber entered protocol. Both rejoined the team this week. The 31-team AHL reportedly has only one unvaccinated player.

Inside the Sabres: UPL Malcolm Subban to man Sabres' crease until Dustin Tokarski returns ""All signs point to Luukkonen and Subban taking over as the club’s tandem until Dustin Tokarski returns from Covid-19 protocol"" writes Lance Lysowski.

NHL games will go on – Carolina is expected to play with only 16 skaters Thursday against Detroit – but the situation takes its toll on players around the league. Okposo explained that having to drive to KeyBank Center on an off day takes away precious time with family but he expressed confidence that the Sabres will endure.

“If we go back to (enhanced protocols on the road) it’s hard” said Okposo the Sabres' NHLPA representative. “It’s going to be tougher for guys sitting in hotels like we did not being able to interact. It’s not an easy thing to do. … We have to support each other through it. … As a team and an organization we’ll get through it together.”

Alex Tuch sheds noncontact jersey close to making Sabres debut Tuch a 25-year-old winger who has yet to appear in a game since arriving from Vegas in the Jack Eichel trade did not wear a noncontact jersey during the Sabres’ practice Wednesday in Xcel Energy Center.

Tuch nearing return

Alex Tuch is close to making his much-anticipated Sabres debut.

Tuch a 25-year-old winger who has yet to appear in a game since arriving from Las Vegas in the Jack Eichel trade did not wear a noncontact jersey during practice Wednesday and could be ready for game action after experiencing more checking during on-ice sessions with the Sabres.

The Sabres have back-to-back road games in Minnesota and Pittsburgh on Thursday and Friday respectively. They host the Columbus Blue Jackets on Monday in KeyBank Center.

""He is close"" Granato said. ""He’s going to go through a couple days of contact and then we’ll get a better picture of strength response. It won’t be within the next five days but it could be soon after that.""

One of two players acquired in the blockbuster November trade Tuch had 61 goals and 139 points in 249 regular-season games with Vegas from 2017 through 2021. He helped the Golden Knights reach the Stanley Cup final during their expansion season and has appeared in 66 career playoff games.

Tuch has totaled 15 or more goals in three of the past four seasons finishing 2020-21 with 18 goals and 33 points in 55 games. He underwent shoulder surgery in July and was expected to be out until sometime in January.

Around the boards

Sabres defenseman Robert Hagg returned to Buffalo to be evaluated for an undisclosed injury that caused him to miss the third period of the win Tuesday night. Granato said the Sabres will recall someone from Rochester to replace Hagg on the roster. Winger Anders Bjork missed practice for maintenance.

The Sabres (9-15-4) had yet to decide which goalie will start against the Wild (19-8-1) on Thursday.

“Last year we delivered more change than in thirty years of Pret history. As we move into the next phase of our transformation we want to keep the same pace of innovation but use it [to] drive new growth.”

The transformation plan was initiated by the company as its recovery gathered pace with business volumes nearing pre-pandemic levels.

During the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic JAB and Beecham supported the coffee chain with an investment of $252m (£185m).

Since the beginning of the year the company’s workforce has also increased by 28% with the company currently employing approximately 8000 individuals globally including 6400 in the UK.

In its accounts filing at Companies House the company noted that its last year revenue was $407m (£299m) which was a decline of $965m (£708m) in comparison to 2019 revenue.

In a statement the company said: “As Pret continues its transformation the business will continue to invest in its customer loyalty programme while also putting a renewed focus on menu development and product innovation.

“The launch of Pret’s recent autumn menu with the Chicken and Chilli Burrito and Naked Chicken Katsu Baguette marked the return of Pret’s famous record of new recipe launches and product innovation for customers following a period of a slimmed down menus through the height of the pandemic.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb2JhbGRhdGEuY29tL3N0b3JlL3JlcG9ydC9ydXNzaWEtZm9vZHNlcnZpY2UtbWFya2V0LWFuYWx5c2lzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Foodservice Market in Russia to 2025 - Market Assessment Channel Dynamics Customer Segmentation and Key ...,"The foodservice profit sector in Russia was valued at $11.4 billion in 2020. The market is projected to grow at a CAGR of more than 14% during the period 2021-2025. In the profit sector quick service restaurants (QSR) was the leading channel in 2020 followed by workplace; travel; pub club & bar; and accommodation. The healthcare segment dominated the cost sector followed by military & civil defense; education; and welfare & services.

The foodservice market in Russia declined significantly in 2020. The decline in the foodservice profit sector was due to the substantial reduction in the number of transactions in 2020 due to strict operational restrictions on restaurants cafés and bars amid the COVID -19 outbreak. Independent operators dominate Russia’s foodservice profit sector in terms of sales. However chain operators fared better than independent operators during the pandemic owing to their strong financial footing and early adoption of changing consumer demands.

What are the market dynamics in the Russian foodservice market?

Take-aways and deliveries played a crucial role in mitigating losses of foodservice businesses to some extent especially in the QSR channel due to convenience and digital and technological advancements. Cooking meals at home from scratch are making more headway due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Cooking meals at home from scratch became crucial for some customers with 69% of respondents stating that they would continue to do this while 21% stated that are doing this more frequently.

Strict restrictions on seating capacities and operating hours of restaurants cafés and eateries along with the fear of COVID-19 infection discouraged people from visiting restaurants and other food outlets. As a result consumers switched toward food delivery services to eat meals at home. While both dine-in and take-away/delivery transactions will grow during this period dine-in occasions will outpace take-away transactions as consumers will return to foodservice outlets with the rollout of vaccination programs. However the at-home consumption trend will continue to grow in the FSR coffee & tea shops and pub club & bar channels during 2020-2025.

What are the sector classifications in the Russian foodservice market?

The foodservice market is segmented into the profit sector and cost sector. The cost sector typically represents the state’s foodservice operators while the profit sector represents the commercial operators.

Profit Sector:

Quick service restaurants market in Russia

Incidentally the largest market share is held by American-led franchises. With more than 20% market share McDonald’s is the market leader followed by Yum! Brands Inc. and Restaurant Brands International. The sales value of the QSR channel is forecast to rise during 2020-2025. The home consumption trend is expected to remain popular. However dine-in occasions are expected to catch up to the growth of take-away transactions during 2020-2025.

Full-service restaurants market in Russia

The FSR channel was greatly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic due to operational restrictions. Moreover many consumers started cooking at home themselves to save money amid weaker purchasing power. The FSR channel in Russia is highly fragmented with the leading five operators accounting for a small share in the market. Yakitoriya is the largest operator in the channel by value.

Coffee & tea shop market in Russia

Local operator Gallery Alex OOO is the leading player in Russia’s coffee & tea shops market. American brand such as Starbucks is the second-largest operator by sales in 2020. The Russian coffee & tea shop channel is forecast to grow at a CAGR of more than 15% during the forecast period. The growth will be driven by the rising demand for premium drinks as well as drinks offering good value for money. An increase in the online presence of coffee shops will be a prominent feature in coming years with the help of delivery service providers such as Yandex.

Pub club & bar market in Russia

The Russian pub club & bar market is highly fragmented and dominated by locally owned and operated outlets. The channel is largely driven by alcoholic drinks. Enhanced menu offerings with widened food options will result in higher transaction values and will also make room for a wider range of visit occasions. With the growth of home consumption of alcohol in 2020 convenience and online ordering will be crucial for consumers.

Cost Sector:

Healthcare foodservice market in Russia

Healthcare was the largest channel in the Russian cost sector. The channel recorded an increase in the number of transactions at more than 2% during 2015-2020 while outlet numbers grew at a CAGR of less than 1%. The healthcare channel is forecast to remain the largest channel in the Russian foodservice cost sector in terms of OBP value. Furthermore the channel is also expected to see the lowest growth in terms of transactions after welfare & services during 2020-2025.

Education foodservice market in Russia

The retail landscape is undergoing a seismic shift largely propelled by technological advancements. The global pandemic and the ascent of eCommerce have only intensified the influence of technology. Retailers have leveraged technology innovations to enhance efficiency while remaining steadfast in their commitment to customer centricity. The result? Total experiences that delight both customers and employees.

However the retail journey doesn't stop here. The evolution of customer behavior and technology continues unabated. Retailers are mandated to stay attuned to this evolution to stay ahead of the curve in terms of sales and customer satisfaction.

The future of retail is poised to ride the technology wave further bridging the physical and digital realms. Retailers are looking beyond mere product sales on shelves aspiring to build comprehensive ecosystems that encompass services spanning health finance entertainment and more capitalizing on digitization and technology's ability to offer enhanced accessibility to consumers. In this era of technological transformation barriers between industries are blurring enabling retailers and other operators to seize opportunities rapidly by engaging directly with consumers.

Some of the technologies that are scripting this transformation and will continue to do so in the future are Artificial Intelligence (AI) Augmented Reality (AR) Virtual Reality (VR) Blockchain Internet of Things (IoT) and others. These multifaceted technologies promise to revolutionize both physical and virtual operations and reshape customer relations. Let’s take a closer look at these modern-day technologies that will undoubtedly shape the future of retail catering to a digital-first digital-only consumer base.

Generative Artificial Intelligence will Drive Customer Benevolence

The ability of Generative AI to work with Large Language Models applying in-context learning to learn from analogy and generate responses based on enhanced understanding of context improved reasoning inference skills and tailored problem-solving capabilities has come out as a potent force for businesses.

Generative AI is a powerful technology that leverages vast datasets to create personalized experiences and optimize various aspects of retail operations. It's not limited to one area but offers multiple benefits across different functions. In content creation and optimization Gen AI autonomously generates and improves product descriptions and copy reducing the need for extensive human involvement. It also excels at providing personalized discounts by analyzing purchase history.

Gen AI extends its capabilities to customer interactions through the development of intelligent bots. These bots go beyond traditional AI bots by generating relevant responses in various formats such as text and visuals based on real-time data. They are efficient in handling customer inquiries and can identify upselling and cross-selling opportunities.

In the context of inventory management Gen AI analyzes multiple data sources including consumer sentiment and competitor data to predict demand accurately. This helps retailers drive sustainability by optimizing supply and delivery preventing inventory deficits and avoiding wastage.

In the instance of supply chain management Gen AI can assist with product configuration in transport ensuring the best possible use of space and safe handling of goods apart from suggesting the most viable transport routes. This ability to optimize the operational aspect of logistics not just saves costs but also augurs well for sustainability reducing carbon footprints and ensuring minimum wastage of perishable and high-value goods.

Gen AI's real-time capabilities also extend to pricing optimization where it can adjust prices based on competitor pricing demand trends and market conditions.

Gen AI can also play a crucial role in fraud detection by identifying counterfeit products unauthorized sellers and fraudulent activities helping retailers save valuable resources and drive sustainability. Similarly the technology can be utilized for product and packaging design optimization reducing material use and encouraging recyclable materials.

The versatility of the technology is already a talking point among retailers around the globe with 92% planning to ramp up their investments in Generative AI as per a GlobalNewswire release.

Immersive Reality will No Longer be a Novelty

Retailers bet big on experience as a major differentiator and try using technology to drive experience as a differentiator. The evolution of Augmented Reality (AR) Virtual Reality (VR) and Mixed Reality has thrown open a new paradigm in experience that seamlessly marries the physical with the virtual. The ability to experience furniture fashion and more from the comfort of the drawing room is a relatively new experience one that customers are eagerly absorbing and consuming. According to a survey by PWC India China and Qatar are most keen on VR. The survey states that 32% of users buy products after checking them out on VR platforms. A similar report on AR from NielsenIQ highlights that 56% of customers feel more confident about the product using AR while 61% said they prefer to shop with retailers offering AR experiences.

AR/VR and MR empower retailers to:

The evolving wave of spatial computing that utilizes a range of technologies including AI ML AR and IoT to establish an awareness of the three-dimensional (3D) environment surrounding an object enable it to interact seamlessly with its surroundings is a fast-developing technology poised to take the experience quotient to another level and promise an immersive engaging future for retail consumers and better returns for retailers. The growing influence of immersive technologies is charting the way for retailers into the evolutionary world of the Metaverse. Retail giants like Nike Gucci and Adidas among others have already made a foray into the virtual world by buying real estate building digital stores conducting fashion shows and hosting concerts. The future state of this space holds a lot of promise for retailers as it is expected to create a digital connection between the customer and the brand like never before. Retail brands are excited about the opportunity as it provides them with direct access to zero-party data of customers enabling retailers and service providers to establish a hyper-personalized connection with the customers. The customer is enthusiastic and buoyed by the surreal experience that is being rendered across these new digital platforms which promises to better all previous experiences from the past.

Expanding the Expanse with Omnichannel Integration

Powering the futuristic omnichannel retail ecosystem at the front end will be a headless commerce architecture that delivers a distinctive consistent customer experience across channels and supports all touchpoints with shared functionalities such as wish lists appointment booking and payments. This architecture is also expected to be more scalable and flexible than a traditional monolithic architecture as it is decoupled from the backend giving retailers the ability to drive changes faster. The world is steadfastly embracing IoT in the shape of wearables home automation and more. The headless architecture will help retailers deliver content across each device type without reinventing the wheel keeping the experience consistent. Talking of the backend the move towards a microservices-based architecture at the backend can also be a game changer for retailers. This decoupling of the monolithic architecture at the backend will help retailers to upgrade or revamp a specific function quickly for example integrating biometrics into the sign-in function or integrating gesture recognition for payment. These new-age capabilities can be separately developed and deployed in a modular fashion. This is unlike how it is done in the traditional monolithic architecture where the complete system would need a revamp for the addition of any functionality.

Blockchain Safeguarding Digital Assets Across the Virtual Terrain

Blockchain technology is a decentralized ledger system that provides robust security and transparency for safeguarding digital assets in the retail sector across the digital landscape. Through its immutable and distributed nature blockchain ensures the integrity of transactions and data reducing fraud and enhancing trust. For example in supply chain management blockchain can trace the origin and journey of products allowing customers to verify the authenticity and quality of goods. It also acts as a powerful tool for driving sustainability within the retail sector by providing retailers insight into their supply chains promoting responsible sourcing and reducing waste. By verifying product authenticity blockchain helps combat counterfeiting ensuring that consumers receive genuine quality products discouraging the production of environmentally damaging fakes.

In e-commerce blockchain-based payment systems like Bitcoin offer secure and borderless transactions eliminating the need for intermediaries. Blockchain can also be a game changer in driving loyalty programs enabling retailers to offer customers rewards securely while smart contracts an agreement based on blockchain technology that kicks in automatically once certain conditions are met can enforce credible transparent agreements on product authenticity warranties or refund policies ensuring a seamless and trust-driven retail experience. Blockchain holds significant value in a rapidly digitizing world that is embracing Non-Fungible Tokens or unique digital identifiers recorded on a blockchain ledger as an identification of ownership and authenticity for digital assets such as art music fashion or any other collectible owned by an entity. One of the main advantages of NFTs is that they allow people to own and intellectual property. NFT cannot be replicated a strong reason why fashion labels and multinational retail conglomerates are exploring the use of NFTs to secure ownership of digital assets and thwart counterfeiting.

Embracing the Future of Retail Technology Today

As inflation and fears of an economic slowdown weigh heavy on the minds of consumers curtailing their spending retailers will need to embrace the advances in technology to attract convince and drive sales to build an all-encompassing retail ecosystem. Retailers will need to deploy new-age strategies powered by contemporary technologies such as artificial intelligence blockchain augmented and virtual reality and more to get up close and personal with their customers building long-lasting trust and value. Retailers will have to look at technology not just for delivering convenience and experience but also as a medium to drive sustainability and security. The time is ripe for retailers to embrace the future of technology to catapult from digital transformation to digital ascendance.
