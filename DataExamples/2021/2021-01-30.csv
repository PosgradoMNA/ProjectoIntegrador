Clubhouse caused some surprise in the tech community last year when secured a $100 million valuation on a $10 million investment for a beta-stage mobile app with 1500 users and no website. Last week The Information reported (N.B. paywall) that Andreessen Horowitz was poised to lead a new funding round valuing the company at $1 billion just eight months later. The series B funding is for a $100 million cash infusion according to Axios.

There are no firm metrics on users but The Information says there were two million by mid-January 2021 “according to two people familiar with the company’s metrics.” After expanding in Japan Turkey and Greece over the past week plus rapid expansion in Europe that figure is surely approaching three million. Vajresh Balaji created the image above with a forecast that suggests Clubhouse will hit that milestone around mid-February.

Another group that has flocked to Clubhouse of late is the voice AI community. That dynamic has led to some interesting conversations and energy around how the voice AI industry might be impacted by this viral social media trend.

The Business of Social Audio

Tech Analyst Jeremiah Owyang has a lengthy write-up about Clubhouse in his blog this weekend titled “The Future of Social Audio: Startups Roadmap Business Models and a Forecast.” It is not a how-to piece as you might surmise by the title. Instead Owyang offers a broad overview of Social Audio as a segment and ideas on how it is likely to evolve. He includes six new product categories he expects to emerge:

Social Audio Analytics Social Audio Management Systems Social Audo App Partners Social Audio Enterprise Software Social Audio Services and Advisors Marketplace for Voice and Conversational Talent

The Social Audio Analytics space is one where the voice AI community is likely to have a direct impact. Owyang mentions speech-to-text NLU and sentiment analysis in this category and these are all core technology components of voice AI. During a more than three-hour Clubhouse conversation this morning related to this article other related topics arose organically as well. Owyang told me over Twitter:

The new idea was voice authentication which I heard from Christine Hwang in my room.

He also mentioned that the NLP discussion has motivated him to learn more about that segment. Voice authentication has some obvious applications for audio chat rooms where you see nothing more than an avatar and hear someone’s voice. It could be a secondary safeguard against deep fakes. The primary safeguard is Clubhouse’s current practices around requesting people’s real names and connecting them to either or both Twitter and Instagram. That’s not perfect but that along with social graph connections are a good start.

The NLP angle is even more interesting. During a Clubhouse Town Hall with company founders Paul Davison and Rohan Seth today there was mention of a deaf user that was participating in audio chat rooms by starting a Google Meet and holding the phone up to the mic with the automated transcription feature turned on. This is a feature that Google added just last week using technology from Otter.ai.

However transcription is the tip of the iceberg. NLP could also be used to drive sentiment analysis of conversations about ideas brands musicians celebrities events and so forth. This is being done today by “listening” to social posts but in those cases it is actually an analysis of text-based content or transcriptions of video posts. As social audio content rises it will be a new channel for assessing sentiment from spoken conversations which will include even richer data even if the reach is smaller.

What Voice AI Community Members are Saying

Dr. Teri Fisher the creator of Voice in Canada and The Voice Den is optimistic about authentication and sentiment analysis specifically. He also believes it will have a big impact on podcasting.

I’m very interested in the authentication in Clubhouse and the implications of that to prove someone’s identity when the whole interactions are through voice. I’m also very interested in the sentiment analysis about the context of the rooms for the audience…Also the fact that you can record with explicit permission of the speakers will change podcasting. I’ve been waiting a long time for some interactivity as a content producer when it comes to my audio content. This seems like it is a great option now to get real-time feedback and then take this content and share it out in other formats. The impact on podcasting was also raised by Michal Stanislawek CEO of Utter.one and co-founder of #voicelunch . He also pointed out opportunities for using core voice AI technologies and how social audio in Clubhouse is different from other social apps. Clubhouse will create opportunities to integrate services like ASR and TTS that we in voice tech are so familiar with. The main application will be to enable people with hearing and speaking disabilities to participate in the discussion. If the platform decides to open up APIs it may go even further and allow an entire ecosystem of apps or plugins to flourish. Clubhouse is different than any other social network. It will build new habits as it is the first one where users actively schedule their participation in the calendar..With functionality of room scheduling I see a clear path for VoiceFirst experience. I’d love to be notified when my favourite friends start a room and when any scheduled room that I signed up for is about to start and then participate without even getting up from the couch. Yenny Cheung engineering manager at Rasa  believes NLP could be helpful in addressing an emerging risk around content moderation but suggests the technology will need to evolve to meet the challenge. One challenge for audio social platforms lies in moderation. As these platforms scale up their social responsibility also grows: protecting their users from harassment. It will pose a technical challenge on speech-to-text and natural language understanding especially when tackling an international audience and a variety of languages that are not English. The idea of using voice AI technology also resonates with James Poulter CEO of Vixen Labs Voice has been looking for a social media play; it looks like social just finally discovered voice. The opportunities here are plentiful but not easy. All social networks need critical mass to go from a niche to something everyone is using – with that comes the burden of moderation verification and safety. I think the voice first industry has a lot to offer the likes of clubhouse in helping them scale a safe community that makes use of conversational AI for good. Social Audio and Voice Clubhouse is not the only game in town when it comes to social audio. Twitter Spaces is expected to emerge from its closed beta sometime this year. It will bring with it a tremendous user base robust social graph and social messaging integration which could help it grow quickly. Jeremiah Owyang believes these features will start to spread among all of the more established social networks and their enterprise-oriented variants. He also cites nearly 20 more independent startups that already have at least some social audio elements. His prediction is that this list will grow to over 100 in 2021. We have written about Clubhouse and Twitter Spaces in Voicebot and Voice Insider and my thesis has been that it could be complementary but is not directly related to the voice assistant space. In many ways it is similar in that way to podcasts. However when we think beyond assistants to voice AI technology in general I can see the rise in all sorts of audio as directly related in a more narrow sense. Voice AI will be in a support role instead of as the key driver of the social audio space but that means it is another avenue for the industry to grow.

Winter has brought with it a resurgence in COVID-19 cases and while the rollout of preventive vaccines has begun the manufacture and delivery of sufficient doses to inoculate all Americans will take months.

Because the disease can be unpredictable everyone should take precautions to mitigate its spread especially when it makes an appearance at home.

While the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends physical distancing mask wearing and other health-related measures the American Society of Heating Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers also recommends additional guidance when a household member is known to be infected to help reduce risk to other household members. Filtrete Brand a leading air filtration brand of 3M also has made some of this information available at Filtrete.com/3M.

First prepare a clean sanctuary within your home either an isolation space — for someone who has contracted COVID-19 — or a protected space for someone who may be at high risk of getting the coronavirus.

Location is especially important. When the weather is warmer the ideal isolation space should be on a low floor; in cooler months a high floor. However for protected spaces the location should be just the opposite: on a high floor in warmer weather and on a low floor in chilly weather. The reason for this is to prevent having air naturally gravitate toward protected spaces as a result of seasonal temperature differences.

Earmarking space is a good start. To further optimize the space for preventing the spread of infection you can address these key elements as applicable to your home understanding there is variation in home construction HVAC systems and climate:

• Windows: Keep windows closed as much as possible throughout the home. In an isolation space use a window-installable product to provide exhaust ventilation. In a protected space supply filtered outdoor air.

• Doors: For an isolation or protected space always keep the door closed. For added safety install a draft stopper under the door or hang plastic sheets in front of the room’s entrance.

• Vents: If you have a forced-air heating ventilation and air conditioning system seal all vents in the isolated or protected space. By doing so you’ll prevent its air from entering other rooms. However if the room you select has the home’s only HVAC return vent it may be wisest to choose another room.

• Portable heating/cooling: If you’re able to seal off all vents you may require a portable room heater or air conditioner so that thermal conditions can remain comfortable.

• Private bathroom: If possible designate a private bathroom for use only by the occupant of the separate room. For a protected space only run the bathroom exhaust fan when the facilities are in use. For an isolated space run the bathroom exhaust fan continuously at high speed.

• Air purification: A system such as the Filtrete Air Purifier with HEPA filtration can help capture unwanted air particles including viruses and bacteria in a protected space. Be sure to change the filter regularly per instructions or according to the device’s electronic filter life indicator. While Filtrete Air Purifier Filters don’t stop or prevent the transmission of COVID-19 they do improve indoor air quality.

This document prepared December 12 2020 provides interim guidance on the use of the Abbott Panbio™ COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test in the context of the Canadian public health system and a coordinated national response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

The Panbio COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test is used for the qualitative detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antigen in human nasopharyngeal (NP) swab samples collected from individuals who are suspected of COVID-19 by their healthcare provider. The Panbio COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test Device functions as a lateral flow assay including both a control and COVID-19 specific test line within a results window. After application of a patient specimen to the test device the presence of a control line within the results window confirms the validity of the test result while the presence of a test line is interpreted as positive for COVID-19.

It should be noted that while Abbott already markets an antigen rapid test that is in widespread use in the United States (BinaxNOW™ COVID-19 Antigen Card) the antigen test which has been approved for use and is being marketed in Canada (Panbio COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test) is manufactured in a different facility. Furthermore the two versions of the Abbott antigen capture test for COVID-19 differ considerably in their design attributes. As such performance characteristics may not be the same. Canadian clinical data is required to validate the test that is in distribution nationally and at the time of writing this data has not yet been adequately collected. Prior to authorization of the Panbio COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test by Health Canada the Canadian Public Health Laboratory Network formed a working group to verify performance characteristics of various antigen capture technologies coming to market. At the time of writing of this document the evaluation and verification of the clinical sensitivity of the Panbio COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test is ongoing. However preliminary analytical sensitivity data suggest that the Panbio COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test will likely have a lower sensitivity when compared with nucleic acid amplification tests including the Abbott ID NOW™ (Table 1).

The use of a lower sensitivity test carries risks to clinical and public health decision-making that can only be offset by the extent of possible benefits. Careful consideration must be made regarding where and how the Panbio COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test is used in order to mitigate the heightened degree of diagnostic uncertainty associated with this technology in comparison with the conventional ""gold standard"" SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing in Canada.

These guidelines are meant to be updated periodically as more information is available regarding test sensitivity and specificity in the overall context of infection with SARS-CoV-2.

While this document as currently written is specific for the Abbott Panbio many of these guidelines may also be applied to any less sensitive molecular and rapid antigen-based tests that are approved for use in the future.

Key messages

Health Canada provided approval for use of the Panbio COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test (October 2020).

The Intended Use for this assay is outlined in the Panbio COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test kit insert and states the following:

""The Panbio COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test Device is an in vitro diagnostic rapid test for the qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 antigen in human nasopharyngeal swab specimens from individuals who meet COVID-19 clinical and epidemiological criteria. Panbio COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test Device is for professional use only and is intended to be used as an aid in the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The product may be used in laboratory and non-laboratory environments that meet the requirements specified in the Instruction for Use and local regulation. The test provides preliminary test results. Negative results don't preclude SARS-CoV-2 infection and they cannot be used as the sole basis for treatment or other management decisions. Negative results must be combined with clinical observations patient history and epidemiological information. The test is not intended to be used as a donor screening test for SARS-CoV-2.""

Clinical performance of the Panbio COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test must continue to be carefully monitored due to the anticipated low sensitivity of the assay.

The performance of the assay should be verified in the field before recommending its use. This is critical since data obtained from pre-market evaluations cannot adequately account for anticipated variability in training or in the quality of sample collection that follows its use in a broader population and particularly in point-of-care (POC) situations.

The Panbio COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test requires the collection of an NP swab. This test may be less acceptable for serial testing of populations particularly in low-risk and asymptomatic individuals as compared with other tests (i.e. Abbott ID NOW which in addition to NP swabs can also be operated with throat or nasal swabs).

The ""in-field"" performance characteristics of the Panbio COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test is still under evaluation in Canada; however data about the performance of the Panbio COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test assay in the United States suggest that the tests have lower sensitivity but comparable specificity to laboratory-developed tests and commercial nucleic acid amplification tests.

Although the rapid nature and the ease of use of the Panbio COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test makes it suitable for POC applications the performance characteristics described above combined with the incidence of infection within the population being tested must be considered when interpreting the results. Indications for testing (e.g. symptomatic versus asymptomatic outbreak vs non outbreak congregated settings vs general population) are also an important consideration in use of this technology.

In discussion with provincial and territorial laboratory directors careful consideration regarding the use of this test must be in place. At this time until further data is collected because of the decreased sensitivity all negatives should be considered preliminary negatives. Owing to an expected higher rate of false negatives (relative to conventional nucleic acid amplitude testing) it is recognized that reflexive laboratory-based testing of preliminary negatives from the Panbio COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test (depending on its proposed use) will likely introduce an additional burden to reference laboratories already facing enormous testing volumes. The utility of lab retesting using a more sensitive method must take into account the initial indication for testing.

This document outlines scenarios where the Panbio COVID-19 Antigen Rapid tests may prove useful should the expected performance characteristics be confirmed.

Current approach to SARS-CoV-2 testing in Canada

Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 testing has been a key pillar of Canada's response to the pandemic. The broad use of testing as part of an array of public health measures contributed to a flattening of the epidemic curve in the spring of 2020 demonstrating the value of testing as a part of the COVID-19 response. To date testing has relied on molecular (i.e. reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RT-PCR) testing performed on a NP or alternate respiratory sample collected by a health care professional. This testing method currently remains the gold standard for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection in Canada.

Considerations for the use of the Panbio COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test

Notwithstanding the difference in the performance profile other features of the Panbio COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test (including but not limited to faster turnaround time lower per-test cost ability to deliver testing in some jurisdictions by non-healthcare professionals and on a more frequent basis) suggest that it could have an important role to play in the next phase of the pandemic response.

It is critically important to understand the timing of specimen collection in relation to symptom onset since the lower sensitivity of the test is not expected to be uniform over the course of infection. Data suggest that viral shedding may begin 2-3 days before symptoms appear peaking around the time of symptom onset and then declining gradually over time Footnote 1 Footnote 2. During the first five days of symptom onset viral loads are most likely to be above the limit of detection for the Panbio COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test although the time post-symptom onset still needs to be carefully considered. It is also important to understand test performance relative to the time since a potential exposure (i.e. the number of days after exposure that one might expect to have viral loads that can be optimally detected with the Panbio COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test) when used for rapid contact tracing.

It is important for public health microbiology and infectious disease experts to identify the scenarios whereby the use of the Panbio COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test may further strengthen the public health response by 1) expanding access to testing beyond existing indications and 2) increasing capacity for detection of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore establishing mechanisms to allow the results from a new POC test to be efficiently input into the public health system is critical (see Reporting of results and quality control section below).

Balancing test sensitivity against other considerations

The intrinsic performance characteristics of the Panbio COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test are not the only factors that determine its utility. The final interpretation of a test must take into account the performance parameters prevalence of infection predictive values and intended use of the test result. Therefore the tolerance for sensitivity and specificity thresholds will vary based on the reason for testing and the expected action that would follow either a positive or a negative result.

In scenarios where critical decisions and actions rely on a test result (e.g. a symptomatic resident in a long-term care home or a patient in the Intensive Care Unit who requires immediate treatment) the recommended test would be the most accurate test. At the time of writing the indicated (best) test would be RT-PCR performed on a NP sample or lower respiratory tract samples in those with evidence of pneumonia. However there may be circumstances where a rapid POC test would be permissible and would enhance testing capacity to support the public health response particularly when the demand for RT-PCR testing exceeds laboratory capacity is otherwise unavailable or in situations where a symptomatic individual may otherwise be lost to follow-up.

Proposed use of the Panbio COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test

One strategy to reduce the sensitivity gap of a technology would be to use repeat serial testing. However this may not be feasible with the Panbio COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test. This technology specifically requires the use of a NP swab which may limit its utility and uptake owing to the uncomfortable nature of the patient specimen collection and the requirement for collection by a healthcare professional. In low prevalence low-risk settings serial repeat testing with the Panbio COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test may not be ideal. This may be particularly relevant in settings involving a paediatric population (daycares schools sport teams).

There are however specific situations that the Panbio COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test might be considered as a suitable option: when infection is present (whether symptomatic or asymptomatic) within a community; symptomatic testing in congregated settings; symptomatic testing in Northern remote and isolated (NRI) communities; and asymptomatic community-based surveillance in the general population.

Infection is prevalent within a community

The Panbio COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test could be used to test individuals when the prevalence of infection is high within a community and the access to timely RT-PCR testing is significantly limited (Figure 1). Positive results could be considered preliminary (presumptive) positive and actioned immediately because of the increased positive predictive value in these settings. Public health action (isolation contact tracing) should be implemented immediately while laboratory-based PCR tests are conducted to confirm results.

Figure 1: Scenario 1-symptomatic testing when infection is prevalent within a community Text description: Figure 1 Figure 1: Scenario 1-symptomatic testing when infection is prevalent within a community Decision Tree representing suggested public health actions reporting and requirement for retesting of symptomatic patients when infection is prevalent within a community (for example during an outbreak). Due to the higher positive predictive value during an outbreak a positive result could be considered a true positive although the need for retesting would be left to provincial/territorial guidance. Figure 1 footnote Figure 1 - abbreviations Abbreviation: PCR polymerase chain reaction

One must take into consideration if an individual who receives a negative result from the Panbio COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test is symptomatic or asymptomatic as all negative results are considered to be ""preliminary (presumptive) negative"".

Scenario 1-symptomatic testing within a community: It is recommended that symptomatic individuals who receive preliminary (presumptive) negative results be re-tested and maintained in isolation until confirmatory laboratory-based RT-PCR testing results are available. The flow diagram in Figure 1 depicts one possible approach to testing; however algorithms are likely to vary across different provinces/territories depending on local factors including stage of pandemic wave and health system experience with the Panbio assay.

NRI communities face additional barriers to accessing timely test results due to transportation time required to deliver a specimen to a testing laboratory. Given the importance of accurately identifying new cases in NRI communities in order to prevent spread in the face of limited healthcare resources RT-PCR testing is the recommended test for these settings. The use of the Panbio COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test may be helpful in NRI communities where access to laboratory-based testing services and rapid results are unavailable or difficult to access.

Scenario 2-asymptomatic testing within a community: The reflexive re-testing of asymptomatic individuals who receive preliminary (presumptive) negative results must take into consideration the burden that will be placed on already overwhelmed laboratory-based testing systems (Figure 2).

Figure 2: Scenario 2-asymptomatic testing when infection is prevalent within a community Text description: Figure 2 Figure 2: Scenario 2-asymptomatic testing when infection is prevalent within a community Decision Tree representing suggested public health actions reporting and retesting of asymptomatic patients when infection is prevalent within a community. In this scenario a positive Panbio result would require retesting by a more sensitive molecular method.

Testing in congregate settings

Scenario 1-symptomatic testing within a congregate setting: While the use of a less sensitive test would not be recommended for the exclusive management of an outbreak testing of symptomatic individuals and direct contacts with the Panbio COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test can be a useful tool for the early identification of possible outbreaks in congregate settings (e.g. long-term care and correctional facilities large processing plants workers in remote mine settings homeless shelters) (Figure 3). Testing can be part of suspected outbreak identification and investigation where patients can be tested rapidly on site if faster preliminary results will help inform and expedite public health action (triage of patients and contact tracing). All POC antigen tests should be followed up with an in-lab PCR test when done in the setting of an outbreak. This may be particularly relevant in situations where a symptomatic individual may otherwise be lost to follow-up (i.e. homeless shelter).

Figure 3: Scenario 1-symptomatic testing in congregate settings a Single molecularly-confirmed positive case within residents or staff initiates the Outbreak Response Text description: Figure 3 Figure 3: Scenario 1-symptomatic testing in congregate settings Decision Tree representing suggested public health actions reporting and retesting of symptomatic patients in a congregated/high-risk setting. In this scenario both positive and negative Panbio results would require reflexive retesting due to the increased consequences of both false negative and false positive results.

Here the intended use of a POC test is for monitoring infection in individuals who may not otherwise be able to be tested with the same frequency due to challenges with testing capacity. Due to the potential reduction in pre-test probability of a positive result the test would have to be confirmed using a laboratory-based nucleic acid amplification test. This requirement for confirmation is to reduce the potential for negative factors associated with a false positive test (e.g. unnecessary removal from work stigma that may be associated with infection).

Scenario 1A-symptomatic testing in isolated northern communities: Panbio COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Tests could be used to screen all individuals in NRI communities presenting with one or more COVID-19 symptoms (within five days of symptom onset) as a means of providing real-time surveillance of a potential COVID-19 outbreak and to expedite public health actions. Due to anticipated delays in the return of laboratory results two NP swabs would always be collected when a patient first presents for care. One NP swab would subsequently be tested on the Panbio COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test while the second NP swab would be reflexively sent for testing by a gold standard molecular method (at a reference laboratory or at a site using the GeneXpert Xpert™ Xpress SARS-CoV-2 molecular test). In this scenario all Panbio COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test results (both positive and negative) would be considered preliminary/presumptive until molecularly confirmed. Presumptive negative results would require symptomatic individuals to continue self-isolation until results were confirmed negative by reference testing while a presumptive positive result would allow for immediate public health actions that could significantly benefit community members at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19 (i.e. over 65 years of age or underlying medical conditions). If a Panbio COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test is confirmed as positive by a molecular reference method the NRI community would initiate an outbreak response that could include ongoing Panbio screening but would also need to incorporate gold standard molecular testing for effective outbreak management.

Scenario 2-asymptomatic testing in congregate settings: Monitoring of asymptomatic individuals who are at risk of introducing infection into high-risk settings could be considered. Modelling data suggest that testing protocols that incorporate repeated and frequent re-testing of asymptomatic individuals could be effective Footnote 3. The one caveat is that there may be resistance by individuals to undergo repeat NP swab collections due to discomfort. The need for a healthcare professional to obtain NP swabs combined with a decreased sensitivity of the Panbio COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test suggest that this technology may have less utility for the repeat serial testing of asymptomatic individuals in the absence of a known outbreak or in a high prevalence setting. At this time the market authorization for the Panbio COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test from Health Canada-Medical Devices Bureau is focussed exclusively on symptomatic testing in the early phase of disease so the use of the test in a monitoring context will require careful clinical validation. The frequency of repeat testing has not yet been defined.

Asymptomatic community-based surveillance in the general population

There is an abundance of data highlighting the asymptomatic spread of SARS-CoV-2. Up to 40% of all transmissions occurring in the general population even with hand hygiene mask use and social distancing appear to be due to silent or asymptomatic transmission events. Widespread testing of individuals in the general population will provide a better understanding of the extent of asymptomatic spread and prevalence of the infection in the general population and may also help to destigmatize testing for COVID-19. Similar to recent know-your-status programs for sexually transmitted blood-borne infections widespread screening and the knowledge that is gained from it can help normalize COVID-19 testing and help to inform and reduce behaviours associated with transmission. Widespread community-based testing of asymptomatic individuals must take into consideration the impact this testing may have on both the healthcare and laboratory systems ensuring that health care and laboratory resources can remain focussed on the needs of high-risk and symptomatic individuals. As such community-based testing for COVID-19 will likely require novel approaches to sample collection such as using non-regulated non-healthcare professionals who are trained to provide testing on site. Tested individuals would either be able to receive results on site or have results returned to them via text or email in a timely manner.

Figure 4 summarizes the steps to be taken for asymptomatic community-based surveillance in the general population.

Figure 4: Asymptomatic community-based surveillance in the general population Text description: Figure 4 Figure 4: Asymptomatic community-based surveillance in the general population Decision Tree representing suggested public health actions reporting and retesting of asymptomatic patients for surveillance of the general population. In this scenario a negative Panbio result would not require reflexive testing owing to the likelihood of overwhelming an already strained laboratory testing program.

In the case of a negative result text messages can also include information about the limitations of a negative result and reinforce public health measures such as continued vigilance/attention to symptoms. Negative results would not require reflexive testing as it would likely overwhelm an already strained laboratory-based testing program.

In the case of a positive result the individual would be told to self-isolate and be appropriately linked to provincial/territorial public health systems for confirmatory testing and follow up (i.e. contact tracing). Information can be provided in parallel to public health to expedite effective interventions.

Reporting of results and quality assurance

The use of the Panbio COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test will most likely occur outside of a laboratory environment. The current anticipated market authorizations are expected to require oversight of the testing procedure by a trained healthcare professional. It will be essential that a mechanism and guidance for reporting of results (particularly positive results) into the public health system and/or laboratory system is established to ensure appropriate data capture and quality control and to support public health action.

It is critical that quality assurance practices be considered when implementing POC testing regardless of the perceived simplicity of the test. Where POC testing is implemented outside a hospital environment sites are recommended to partner with local accredited laboratories for ongoing guidance and oversight. The laboratory director and partnering laboratories will guide sites to ensure important quality assurance practices are in-place.

Examples of quality assurance practices that must be considered:

Training and ongoing authorization of staff who will perform POC testing

Initial and ongoing reagent validation prior to clinical use

Quality control practices for regular monitoring of test performance

Proficiency testing to monitor overall testing practices at a site

Troubleshooting issues with tests and/or devices

Reporting of results

Critical scientific questions

The state of the science continues to evolve daily as unprecedented global investment in research and development continues. Despite this there remains a number of critical questions to inform the use of new tests such as the Panbio COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test and sample types.

How do these tests perform in ""real life"" situations? Many submissions for regulatory approval have used simulated samples to evaluate tests. This creates uncertainty about the true performance when applied to actual patients. There must be a verification of performance by comparing the real life performance of intended use in the field compared to the traditional nucleic acid amplification methodology.

How frequently is testing required to close the sensitivity gap? This requires understanding of the dynamics of the test over time. It will be important to determine the frequency of testing to best mitigate the risk of cases being missed due to the lower sensitivity of the Panbio COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test. At what threshold of community transmission is repeat testing in specific environments beneficial?



Conclusion

This document provides interim guidance on the use of the Abbott Panbio COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test in the context of the Canadian public health system and a coordinated national response to the coronavirus disease. These guidelines are meant to be updated periodically as more information is available regarding test sensitivity and specificity in the overall context of infection with SARS-CoV-2 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

Two best friends have guns trained at each other’s head agreeing that yep on the count of three they’ll shoot bringing to end two lives that in their eyes haven’t been worth living an inevitable solution to a bleak problem. Predictably we then rewind to “earlier that morning” to see how the pair found themselves on the precipice of suicide at the back of a strip club.

Val (Jerrod Carmichael also the first-time director) goes from glumly smoking in bed to glumly smoking at work a life without aim or purpose one that he sees no point in continuing. Kevin (Christopher Abbott) is no stranger to trying to kill himself having bounced from therapist to therapist to an institution where he’s currently staying doggedly attempting to convince his doctor to let him go despite a suicide attempt just three days prior. When Val goes to visit he decides to break him out revealing his life-ending master plan but just as they prepare to fire Kevin decides that there are a few things they need to do first taking them on a journey through their youth tying up loose ends before they die later that evening.

In the space of just 84 minutes comedian Carmichael working off a script from Ari Katcher and Ryan Welch tries to wring humour and pathos from the pair’s manic last day hitting everything from child molestation to depression to domestic violence with cameos from Henry Winkler Tiffany Haddish and JB Smoove a bravely stacked debut that just about avoids toppling over. Like the characters themselves though it’s forever on the verge of falling apart hurtling along at speed with every hit matched by a miss. It’s the unusually wrought friendship and the frank mental health discussions that keep it on track. We’re so accustomed to seeing young men talk around issues of depression that it’s a relief to see two characters facing it head on without shame or embarrassment and the script shows how they exist on opposite ends of the same sad spectrum dealing with their hopelessness in different ways.

Carmichael more traditionally associated with strictly comic fare such as his well-received sitcom The Carmichael Show makes a striking debut as a film-maker opting for unusual visual and music choices throughout and showing confidence with the film’s more ambitious setpieces (a final quarry-based standoff is rather beautiful in scope). He’s not always as well-served by the script though which relies a little too heavily on unfunny buddy comedy quarreling a tactic that starts to grate by the film’s finale. It’s a shame because there are also nice little character details littered throughout – Kevin’s unease with using a gun as it betrays his political leaning; Val’s effective monologue about the doomed idea that fixing one thing might fix everything; the discussion over how playing on-the-nose songs to match your emotion is corny – that hint at a better slicker draft of the same story. The pair do their best with the uneven dialogue they’re given and there’s a strong enough chemistry between them to sell the more underwritten elements of their friendship but still one keeps wondering what could have been with something a little tighter.

Abbott in particular is a marvel a Sundance mainstay at this stage allowed to play the more fully fleshed of the two whose childhood of abuse and willfully unhelpful therapy has led to a fractured view on the world and he digs deep to sell even the falsest of moments. With delicate material the film treads sensitively (Carmichael consulted mental health experts to ensure authenticity) and any fears over something that might glorify or diminish suicide are quickly allayed. While it’s ultimately a little too messy to work quite as well as it could have given the interesting and ambitious ingredients On the Count of Three is proof that Carmichael is a director to be excited about hoping that perhaps he finds time to write his next script himself (although his upcoming slate as a writer – including a 48 Hours remake with the Safdie brothers and a Django Unchained sequel with Quentin Tarantino – suggests he might be a tad busy). It’s a good shot but next time I’m sure he’ll hit the bullseye.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vZXcuY29tL21vdmllcy9tb3ZpZS1yZXZpZXdzL2plcnJvZC1jYXJtaWNoYWVsLW9uLXRoZS1jb3VudC1vZi10aHJlZS1zdW5kYW5jZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jerrod Carmichael delivers a raw darkly hilarious first film with 'On the Count of Three',"""When you're a kid they tell you the worst thing in life is to be a quitter"" Val (Jerrod Carmichael) marvels to his best friend Kevin (Christopher Abbott) early on in On the Count of Three. ""Why? Quitting is amazing! It means you no longer have to do a thing you hate.""

He's talking about his job at some kind of landscape supply store — his excitable boss has just laid out a bright future for him in gravel and topsoil — but what he really wants to quit in fact is life. Kevin is already way ahead of him; he's just spent the weekend in a mental-health facility after swallowing a fistful of pills. Val comes to break him out One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest style; and once they're home free floats the idea of a more permanent immediate solution: a suicide pact ASAP.

If Kevin agreed on the spot On the Count of Three (which lands in theaters May 13 nearly a year and a half after its premiere at the 2021 Sundance Film Festival) would be over before the title card. Instead he asks for one last day to wrap up whatever business they've got left and the movie settles into the blackest kind of buddy comedy — a lacerating slice of nihilism rooted in real despair and real I-love-you-man tenderness too.

That kind of funny is pretty much Carmichael's brand though the actor and stand-up comic has rarely put it on screen as starkly he does in his feature-directing debut. Shot in intimate 35mm the whole thing is almost shockingly short (just over 80 minutes) and the style poetically raw like an old Jim Jarmusch movie. (If these two guys get to heaven it probably won't look much like Three's wintry parade of strip-club side alleys bland office parks and ill-lit convenience stores.)

The plot by nature is mostly episodic too; nimble jittery jumps from scene to scene. But Carmichael makes nearly all of them count: Abbott's Kevin — in a puffer coat sweatpants and the bleached-blond curls of a depressed Justin Timberlake — is painted right away as the guy pretty much made of feelings; everything touches him like a raw nerve. Val is the opposite: numb to the girlfriend (Tiffany Haddish) who keeps leaving unanswered calls the manager who wants to promote him the whole world he swears he can hardly care enough to stand. ""Not waking up tomorrow"" he confesses. ""Is the most beautiful thought I've had in a long time.""

Still he agrees (mostly because he has to) to Kevin's proposition — which involves among other things french fries dirt bikes and a final visit with the malevolent therapist (Henry Winkler) who did anything but heal him as a kid. That also leaves time to pursue his own closure with his estranged dad (J.B. Smoove) and maybe even his girl — and to ponder more than once whether either of them are truly ready to stick with their mutual-destruction plan.

The script by Ari Katch and Ryan Welch (cocreators of Hulu's Emmy-winning dramedy Ramy) is steeped in a sort of slouchy Millennial wit both ruthless and almost pathologically detached. But Val and Kevin aren't just cool-kid vessels of 21st-century apathy; they're weird and funny and vulnerable and sad. And even as the story picks up speed and velocity their choices rattling inevitably towards a climax neither can walk back from Three supplies its own sideways version of the thing that's eluded its two leads for too long: hope and a reason to care.

Noah Galilee and Dustin Isom owners of Humble Roots LLC and Collins look forward to continuing to provide the most accurate and comprehensive news coverage in the Cullman County area.

The Cullman Tribune was founded in 1874 and is Cullman’s oldest continuously operating business and the oldest continuously published weekly newspaper in Alabama. The Cullman Tribune is also proud to be Cullman’s only locally-owned newspaper and one of only two Alabama Press Association accredited news sources in the area.

Galilee and Isom formed CullmanSense in late 2010. It was the first online news platform in the area solely dedicated to local news coverage and officially launched Jan. 1 2011.

“Noah and I started CullmanSense in my bedroom a decade ago with less than $100 to pay for our website hosting and domain with a goal of simply reporting the news as unbiasedly as we can. There were moments where we thought we would not reach this goal and this idea would become but a memory” said Isom. “Through the years we have persevered only because of the continued support of our community and our incredible crew. We have always been an independent locally owned and operated can’t be paid off not afraid to report the truth even if it hurts the bottom line news organization dedicated to original factual reporting. As we integrate with Cullman Today we will continue providing positive family-friendly content across a variety of channels and we will strive to be a source of positivity uplifting our community through these unusual times.”

The two formed Humble Roots LLC as they eyed their first purchase The Cullman Tribune which was officially acquired April 1 2016. Under their leadership The Cullman Tribune has grown its publication rate from once per week to Cullman’s only 5-day print publication.

Abbott explained the history of Cullman Today sharing “My late husband Tim Collins launched Cullman Today in early 2015 much to my surprise. I came home from a family trip and he announced to me that he just started an online paper. As you can imagine I was in shock. Tim was a naturopath at one point in his life a holistic health merchant a mortgage broker a website builder but newspaper owner was not in the arsenal of jobs I was familiar with. I had no idea he was interested in that but he was great at it. He could write in a way that brought a situation to life. Sometimes it made you laugh and other times it made you go ‘Did he just say that?’ But it was always colorful and in authentic one-of-a-kind Tim Collins fashion.”

She continued “Tim spent all of his time writing about the people in this community highlighting our heroes in blue the heroes who fight the fires each and every day (most of them for free) and our EMS heroes. He was a pioneer in many ways and changed the way that a lot of our news is reported today. Cullman Today was his life and it allowed him to connect with others in a deeply profound way. Cullman Today was basically a love letter to the one and only place that ever felt like home to Tim.”

Abbott and Galilee have been friends for many years but some of those years are described as rocky by both.

Galilee said “Tiffany has been a friend since middle school days. When her late husband Tim launched Cullman Today just a few years after the launch of CullmanSense our friendship dimmed for a few years as competition generally breeds some sort of contempt. Those were not the best years but I am glad they are behind us and our relationship is repaired. The acquisition of Cullman Today by Humble Roots LLC served multiple purposes first of which was to relieve Tiffany from the enormous amount of stress and pressure that come with operating a news service. She has been through the ringer the past few years and she has earned the right to relax. Secondly the acquisition of Cullman Today means there will be a bit more content including more videos and some audio casts- not going to say too much as we are still working on a couple of projects.”

Abbott also acknowledges that the relationship between The Tribune and Cullman Today was not always great sharing “It’s no secret that we have not always been the best of friends. What people do not know is that Noah and I have known each other for many years. We went to school together in middle and high school and we were very close during that time. I think it’s a beautiful thing to work together put aside past differences and make Cullman Today reach its full potential going forward. I truly feel that this was the best decision for myself my family and my business.”

Carrying on the name and work of Tim Collins and Cullman Today is an aspect of the acquisition Galilee intends to honor.

“While Tim and I never spoke before he passed I was able to learn more about him and what his true intentions were for Cullman Today and I find it admirable” he said. “At the time natural competition dictated my moves but as the years passed by it became clear that Tim was a great ambassador for Cullman County. He genuinely had others’ best interests at his core and that is something that will not leave Cullman Today.”

When asked what this means to her and about Cullman Today’s future Abbott said “It means for me personally much needed time to rest spend time with my family and friends and an opportunity to focus on my health. I think the reason I’ve stayed so busy all of these years was to keep my mind off the grief and painful loss we have endured. As for Cullman Today it means an exciting new chapter growth and continuing what Tim built while honoring him and his hard work.”

While Abbott’s decision was not an easy one allowing Humble Roots LLC to acquire Cullman Today is something she is happy with.

“I feel great about it. I know that it will allow Cullman Today to grow in ways I would not have been able to make happen” she said. “As I mentioned earlier I needed more time with my family and friends time to rest and my time was very limited. At one point I was operating two businesses and involved with three nonprofits. This purchase will allow Cullman Today to expand on multiple platforms. It means that just because I don’t have the time and energy to make it go it will not die or disappear. I am grateful for this opportunity.”

The acquisition of Cullman Today will result in minimal changes to The Cullman Tribune according to Galilee who added “The Tribune will continue to print five days per week and post news online daily. We have built the strongest publication in the region and the amount of new print subscribers and daily digital downloads has proven that we are on the correct path. The Cullman Tribune will serve as the main hub for news aggregation for all social media platforms. As far as our day-to-day business it will continue on the same.”

As for changes you can look for at Cullman Today Galilee said “Besides some aesthetics such as a new logo Cullman Today will serve as more of a family fun relaxing lifestyle and free-flowing news aggregate for the Cullman Tribune. It will continue to have breaking news and weather and we will be introducing a new line of videos and podcasts.”

The Cullman Tribune is also excited to welcome members of the Cullman Today family as the two crews come together Galilee said. “The crews from both will work together but assignments will differ based on content. We are happy to have Macie and Coleman joining us from Cullman Today and they have already begun working with our reporters and editorial staff. It’s gone quite well. There were many volunteers at Cullman Today so we will spend the next week reaching out to each individually to find out which ones would like to continue shooting photographs and sending in reports.”

The addition of the Cullman Today crew will add even more depth to a team at The Cullman Tribune who brought home 24 Alabama Press Association Media Awards in 2020 including 2020 Photo of the Year Best In-Depth News Coverage Best Human Interest Column Best Use of Social Media and Most Improved building on the six awards won in 2019.

Abbott has not ruled out future contributions to Cullman Today and The Cullman Tribune. She said of her role for now “I will continue to share Cullman Today news and support Cullman Today. It was built by the man I loved more than anything. Keep your eyes peeled you may see me now and then involved with certain projects and creative endeavors. My dear friend and partner in Cullman Today Tonya Quick will continue to run our sister page Hanceville Today to cover local events happenings and news in Hanceville.”

Galilee concluded “At the end of the day I have spent over 16 years in the news industry while Dustin has spent a decade so between us and our meetings with Tiffany we can assure this acquisition is going to be a great one for all involved from the readers to advertisers and all those who will have their stories told. We are grateful and humbled to take over where Tiffany has left off and will keep true local news flowing for decades to come.”

The above graph represents the worldwide Apple iPhone sales by quarter starting from fiscal Q3 2007 to Q1 2021. Due to the declining sales of iPhones Apple has stopped revealing the sales figure of the iPhone from the first quarter of fiscal 2019 (Oct-December 2018). However a market research firm IDC continues to estimate the number of iPhones sold every quarter along with other 5 top vendors’ smartphone shipments worldwide.

Apple shipped a whopping 90.1 million units of iPhones during Oct-Dec 2020 worldwide. The 22.2% YoY growth was primarily driven by huge demand for the iPhone 12 series.

Region Worldwide Source Apple’s official Reports SEC Filings IDC Graph ID 118 Note Apple financial year starts from October 1st

The global iPhone sales declined a notable 10.6% YoY during the fiscal Q4 2020 totalling 41.6 million units. The decline in shipments was mainly due to the delay in iPhone 12 launch series. However its iPhone 11 series iPhone SE 2020 did quite well.

In fiscal Q1 2019 quarter Apple shipped 68.4 million units of iPhones worldwide. Despite launching three most expensive iPhones – iPhone XS Max iPhone XS and iPhone XR – the company has registered a notable 11.5% YoY decline in its iPhone sales.

The iPhone price cut in China throughout the second quarter along with favourable iPhone trade-in deals in many markets were still not enough to encourage consumers to upgrade their iPhones.

Apple iPhone Sales: History!

It was the fiscal Q1 2017 when the global sales of Apple iPhones reached an all-time high of 78.29 million units. That’s 4.7% YoY and a whopping 72% QoQ growth. The holiday quarter helped the company to generate its highest quarterly revenue ever. However one thing has to be kept in mind that the December quarter being the holiday season has always been Apple’s best quarter and so a QoQ growth rate comparison is meaningless.

The first generation of iPhone was launched in June 2007 at the price of $499 for the 4GB model and $599 for the 8 GB model. And after 10 years in September 2017 Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) celebrated its 10th anniversary of iPhone by launching its most-expensive most-innovative iPhone X along with iPhone 8 and 8 Plus.

Despite tagged as ‘failed’ and ‘flop’ iPhone X emerged as the world’s best-selling smartphone model in both fiscal Q1 2018 and fiscal Q2 2018. In fiscal Q2 2018 3 out of every 10 units of sold iPhones globally were iPhone X.

There was unprecedented growth recorded in the worldwide sales of iPhone after the launch of iPhone 6 and its successor iPhone 6S. In fact iPhone 6S has been the most selling iPhone model to date.

Once at the stage of near bankruptcy the table got turned for Apple after the visionary CEO Steve Jobs decided to join back the company in 1997. Known for his leadership style and rigid attitude Steve Jobs took four years to turn the table back (read known facts about Steve Jobs). With the launch of iPod in 2001 Steve Jobs successfully got the eyes of the industry experts investors and critics back on the growth of Apple.

However it was only 2007 when Steve successfully shifted the gears with the launch first iPhone – a complete touchscreen smartphone running on iOS. After the initial hiccups the worldwide sales of iPhone skyrocketed from fiscal Q4 2008 when Apple recorded nearly 9X jump in the sales of the iPhone.

In 2017 Apple launched iPhone X – the 10th anniversary iPhone. Despite facing strong criticism for its pricing strategy the sales of iPhone X kept increasing and became the most selling smartphone model of Q2 2018.

Nexia BT was hired in 2015 to draw up an evaluation report about the deal after Enemalta’s Chinese partners Shanghai Electric Power (SEP) sought an explanation about its price tag sources familiar with the deal told Times of Malta.

In December 2015 the same month Enemalta went ahead and paid the €10.3 million Nexia BT sent an e-mail indicating that former Energy Minister Konrad Mizzi and former OPM chief of staff Keith Schembri would receive up to €2 million from murder suspect Yorgen Fenech’s company 17 Black.

An internal Enemalta probe was launched after Times of Malta and Reuters had revealed how the former Electrogas director had secretly profited from the deal via 17 Black.

Instead of Enemalta buying shares in the wind farm project directly from the owner (the Spanish consortium Fersa) Enemalta reached an agreement with an intermediary company called Cifidex. Cifidex did not even own the wind farm shares at the time Enemalta’s board formally gave the go-ahead to pursue the deal with it in January 2015.

The introduction of Cifidex into the deal saw them sell shares they had bought from Fersa for €2.9 million in December 2015 onto Enemalta for €10.3 million just two week later.

At the time Cifidex was owned by Turab Musayev a former Socar Trading director of the Electrogas power station consortium. Musayev has denied any wrongdoing.

Enemalta sealed the wind farm deal in late 2015.

The sources explained how Shanghai Electric Power had flagged how Cifidex was going to buy the project shares from Fersa for a third of the €10.3 million it would sell them for to Enemalta.

Accenture the advisers that worked with SEP on the deal were the ones who initially reached out to Nexia BT in January 2015 about drawing up a report.

Nexia BT brought in

Accenture the advisers that worked with SEP on the deal were the ones who initially reached out to Nexia BT in January 2015 about drawing up a report.

Accenture representative Chen Cheng used Nexia BT to open an offshore company in the British Virgin Islands and an account at the now-defunct Pilatus Bank that would according to Nexia BT receive a cash injection of €1 million in 2015 the same year the wind farm deal was completed.

Chen had introduced the Montenegro project to Enemalta’s board in December 2014 describing Cifidex as the “sole agent” for the deal.

A copy of Chen Cheng’s business card was among the documents seized from Fenech’s Portomaso office.

Fenech resigned as an Electrogas director week before his arrest and eventual arraignment on complicity charges in journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia’s murder. Fenech denies the charges.

Apart from an internal Enemalta investigation into the deal a police probe and magisterial inquiry were also opened into the scandal which led to Konrad Mizzi being ejected from the Labour Party."

Image theft is no joke; when you've taken hours days even months or years to capture the right photograph the last thing you want is someone else pinching it for their own use. Perhaps you want to send a proof or contact sheet out to clients so they can pick from a group of photos but don't want them taking the shots and avoiding paying you? Or you may just want to give a little link in the photo so others who see your work online can trace it back to you and get in touch. These are just three important reasons why you'd want to apply a watermark.

So in this guide I'll show you how to apply a watermark in Lightroom Classic using your own signature or logo and the great news is once you know what to do it should take you less than 60 seconds. Not only will I show you how to apply a watermark but I'll also go over how to save the watermark layout so that you can apply this to hundreds or thousands of images automatically when saving your shots.

Head to Export

In Lightroom Classic prep your photograph before heading to the export options to save your image.

Navigate to Watermarks

First up select the photo you want to add your signature or logo to then go to File>Export (Ctrl+Shift+E or Cmd+Shift+E on a Mac). Alternatively you can do this on the photo itself by right-clicking it and going to Export. Don't be tempted to click on any of the preset export options you may have displayed when using this method as you won't have the option to add your watermark.

Head to the watermarks tab and click on the drop-down menu to get ready to edit your own watermark.

Choose a Graphic

In the Export options window that appears scroll down the menu until you get to the Watermarking tab. Tick the box next to the word Watermark and click on the drop-down menu next to it. Notice how I already have some preset watermarks set up this is where you can choose yours once you've made some. For now head to Edit Watermarks to bring up the next window.

We could just type our signature into the text box in the Watermark Editor window but instead head to the Choose button to find your own graphic signature or logo.

Select the Right One

Now that we have the Watermark Editor window open we could head down to the bottom-left to start typing in a quick text-based signature. However we're going to be adding our own pre-existing signature or logo to then apply over the photo so ignore this area for now. Instead head up to the top-right and under the Image Options tab click on the Choose button. Bear in mind that it states to ""please choose a PNG or JPG image"" so TIFFs GIFs PSDs etc. won't work here. If you don't have a PNG or JPG version of your signature or logo head into Photoshop import the graphic and save it as either before continuing with this guide.

Navigate to your signature or logo graphic and open it up Lightroom should now close the explorer window and apply it to the photo.

Change the Size

After clicking the Choose button another window will flash open (File Explorer in Windows or Finder on a Mac). From here we need to navigate to the folder where the logo or signature graphic is saved. Once you've found it select the image and either double-click it or press the Choose button in the bottom right. The explorer window will close and drop back to the Watermark Editor.

Make adjustments to the size and opacity of your logo using the sliders provided.

Alter the Position

Now the logo or signature appears as a watermark on the photograph and by default it is laid in the bottom-left corner. On the right-hand side click on Watermark Effects to reveal a host of sliders and buttons we can use to alter the size and placement of the logo. Depending on the color and shape of your logo or signature you may need to dial down the Opacity slider so that it's less conspicuous in the photo. This step is especially important if your shot relies on having clean areas with plenty of negative space. Usually photographers place a watermark on a photo so that it shows up if anyone tries to steal or recreate the image and so are inclined to keep opacity to 100% as I have here but others prefer a subtle logo splash.

Change the position of your logo using the Anchor points in the 3x3 grid display at the bottom of the window.

Just as you wouldn't shoot with exactly the same composition every time nor do you need to keep your logo in the same spot for each photo. Thankfully the Watermark Editor allows us to reposition the logo. Scroll to the bottom of the window and find the Anchor section. From here you can click on one of the radio buttons to have the signature appear in the same location as the 3x3 grid display. Don't worry we'll still be able to precisely place the watermark in a moment; this is just a rough placement for now (unless you're happy with the position already).

Adjust the Inset and Rotate

I rotated my signature and altered the horizontal and vertical inset sliders so that it would fit down the right-hand edge of the frame.

Our watermark is almost exactly where we want it. Just a little more jiggling around with the settings and we should be ready to export. I decided to place the logo on the right-hand side and adjusted the Horizontal Inset slider to 3 and Vertical Inset slider to 6 to bring it both away from the right edge of the frame and center it up vertically. I then also clicked the Rotate right button to spin it on its side. When you're happy with your settings click Save and then click Export if you're ready to complete the photo save.

Save Your Progress

Save your progress so you don't have to apply the watermark manually to every photo.

Alternatively instead of just exporting the photo you may want to save the progress you've made with making the watermark. Even though the process can take less than 60 seconds what if you want to export 100 photos with your signature on them? That's going to take well over an hour something that just isn't necessary. Once you've made your watermark adjustments click on the drop-down menu in the top-left of the Watermark Editor window and head to Save Current Settings as New Preset. In the window that pops up give it a name and click Create. Now the watermark you've made with your signature or logo will appear in the drop-down list under the Watermarks tab when exporting future photographs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiIWh0dHBzOi8vY3JlYXRpdmVwcm8uY29tL3BhcnRuZXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,CreativePro Solutions Providers,"Adobe is changing the world through digital experiences.

So where is the sequel Bass teased several years ago? Legal limbo unfortunately.

“You know movies people think are made in Hollywood. But they are made in lawyer’s offices” Tan said. “This [sequel] deal is stuck in the lawyer’s office. It’s far from being approved but it’s been stuck there for months.”

“The Joy Luck Club” movie sequel might be at a legal pause but Tan isn’t letting the long wait to begin work on the project dim her spirits. As the writer said “It doesn’t bother me. Ive taken an attitude about movies that I only do things that are worthwhile in the moment. I can never do a project where the reward of doing it occurs in the future. That’s the danger of doing film. A lot of people get excited and they are imagining the premiere they’re imagining long lines at the box office and a lot of time that doesn’t happen. I never wanted to waste my life and so if I make a decision to make a movie I got to know it’s worthwhile in the moment. It can fall apart later and that’s fine.”

“Right now everybody knows that I never get involved with the business” Tan continued. “We are in the stage of the business right now so I am not keeping up with it. I don’t go to meetings. I don’t read the emails because maybe it wont come to anything so why would I look at these business emails? That will all happen or not happen without me. My part will be to work with Ron on the screenplay.”

When the idea of whether or not her “Joy Luck Club” sequel could be a television series instead of a film Tan responded “I don’t really understand TV that well and how they put things together. I don’t understand the structure of TV whereas I do understand the structure of short stories and novels and to a certain degree movies. I don’t watch that much television. It could work as a TV series.”

Will any of last year’s top winners even be on the new list?

After The Economist‘s bizarre MBA ranking last week the Financial Times Global MBA ranking is set to go public on Feb. 8. The new ranking will arrive a week later than typical for the FT yet that is much quicker than The Economist‘s list which was published two and one-half months behind schedule.

The big question confronting the new list? Will the FT ranking face a similar boycott that led 15 of the top 25 business schools in the world to decline cooperation with The Economist. Given the FT‘s importance in business education particularly in Europe and Asia speculation is that the list won’t suffer the same fate as the revered Economist. But it’s likely that at least some schools will part ways at least temporarily with the FT using the pandemic as justification.

Last year Harvard Business School nudged aside Stanford Graduate School of Business for top honors on what was the 21st edition of the Financial Times ranking. Since 2000 when the Financial Times began its MBA ranking Harvard has only captured the top spot six times out of 21 chances. The biggest winner? Wharton with ten overall wins. Wharton in fact topped the ranking for the first nine lists though Wharton shared the limelight twice once with Harvard in 2005 and twice with London Business School in 2009 and 2011. The dominance of the U.S. MBA programs is striking. European schools have claimed sole possession of the FT ranking in only three years with INSEAD earning top honors in 2016 and 2017 and London Business School in 2010. None of these schools participated in The Economist‘s 2021 ranking.

LAST YEAR’S TOP TEN GLOBAL MBA PROGRAMS ON THE FINANCIAL TIMES RANKING

Following Harvard on the 2020 list were the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School No. 3 Stanford Graduate School of Business No. 4 INSEAD and No. 5 CEIBs in Shanghai China. These were the exact five MBA programs at the top of last year’s Financial Times’ ranking only reshuffled. Stanford slipped two places while Wharton improved two spots from fourth to it second-place finish. INSEAD inched lower by one spot while CEIBs maintained its highest rank ever achieved last year in fifth.For the first time ever HEC Paris cracked the top ten soaring ten places to rank ninth from 19th a year earlier. That impressive jump put HEC Paris just below No. 8 Columbia Business School and one spot before the No. 10 MBA program at the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business.

(Readers of Poets&Quants are invited to play our MBA Ranking Fantasy Game to guess the top ten in the forthcoming FT ranking here.)

Story continues

Any significant boycott obviously would scramble the list’s traditional winners clearing the field for the schools that cooperated with the FT just as they did with The Economist’s 2021 ranking (see Ten Biggest Surprises In The Economist’s New 2021 MBA Ranking).

THE FT RANKING IS BASED ON 20 DIFFERENT METRICS

The Financial Times global ranking is the most closely followed in Europe and Asia while U.S. News’ entirely U.S.-centric ranking has become the most influential in the U.S. The FT’s methodology is based on 20 different metrics including several that tend to favor non-U.S. schools. Among other things metrics that add score points to a school’s standing include the percentage of students faculty and trustees who carry passports from a country where the school is not located whether students and alumni worked in foreign countries whether students had an international course experience and whether the school requires students to learn extra languages prior to graduation.

What any of these criteria have to do with the quality of an MBA degree is a matter of opinion. This year will be the third with a relatively new metric: Corporate Social Responsibility. With a weight of just 3% it is based on the proportion of teaching hours from core courses dedicated to CSR ethics social and environmental issues.

Often an even greater impact on a school’s rank can be the result of the FT’s decision to use a purchasing power parity (PPP) formula to convert and count actual salary data — the most heavily weighted metric in the methodology. Such currency gymnastics favor schools that supply graduates to countries with high rates of poverty. With the PPP adjustment for example it’s probable that CEIBS would not have finished in the top five last year. The school’s latest employment report shows that the median base salary for MBAs in 2019 was $64278. The FT’s adjusted salary today figure for CEIBS alumni three years out is $184731 nearly three times larger. Or consider the starting median salary for graduates of IIM-Ahmedabad. They earned only $27951 two years ago but the FT’s adjusted salary today for alums is an extraordinary generous $186866. This adjustment has an especially negative impact on U.S. schools because the vast majority of international students who get an MBA in America want to live and work in the U.S. where their compensation would not be inflated by the PPP filter.

THE RANKING DOES NOT MEASURE INCOMING STUDENT QUALITY

What’s more even though the FT places a 40% weight on these pay numbers they fail to account for total compensation — just salary. In the U.S. a good many MBAs from elite schools often get stock options (at Stanford a record 41% of this past year’s graduating class got stock in their starting packages) and significant annual bonuses that would put their schools well ahead of many of the institutions that are routinely ranked higher by the Financial Times.

Unlike U.S. News moreover the FT pays no attention at all to incoming student quality in its ranking — another reason why U.S. schools do less well on this list. GMAT and GRE scores and undergraduate grade point averages all key components of a business school admission decisions — are ignored. Another issue with the FT ranking is that the newspaper fails to reveal the underlying index scores that allow it to crank out the numerical rankings. Those scores show whether a school’s rank is statistically different among other schools ranked nearby. In most rankings these index scores tend to cluster in close bands and often show that there is no meaningful statistical difference between a school ranked 45th and one ranked 50th. The FT concedes that clustering is a reality and that there are four different groups of schools on its list of the top 100.

Its stock rose 570% more than Zoom Moderna and just about every other growth stock other than Tesla. Enphase is now the largest publicly traded pure-play U.S. solar stock by market capitalization.

Enphase has some impeccable growth prospects and a leading position in a booming industry. But there are a number of reasons why its stock may have ran too far too fast in 2020. Here's why Enphase Energy is a great company but its stock is too expensive right now.

The turnaround

If you were an investor scanning the market for solar stocks in the summer of 2017 you probably wouldn't have noticed the less than $75 million gem that was Enphase Energy. The company that had once been valued at over half a billion dollars and sold for $15 a share was now trading for less than $1 a share. On the brink of bankruptcy and losing market share to rival SolarEdge (NASDAQ: SEDG) Enphase then restructured and went on to have one of the better four-year comebacks on Wall Street. Trading at over $200 a share today you won't find many companies that have produced an over 200-fold return faster than Enphase.

Excellent growth

Enphase's epic surge is due in part to its growth numbers -- which have been impressive. The company doubled revenue between 2018 and 2019. The results aren't out yet but Enphase is guiding for revenue between $245 million and $260 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 which would bring total 2020 revenue to around $762 million (a 22% gain over 2019). Aside from revenue the company is now consistently reporting profitable quarters on a non-GAAP basis growing its operating cash flow and sporting the highest gross margin in its history. At 53% its GAAP gross margin is closer to leading chip manufacturers like NVIDIA or AMD than it is to other solar companies.

Concerning valuation

Just like Enphase's gross margin resembles leading chip manufacturers its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio resembles that of trendy electric vehicle stocks like Tesla and Nio.

Enphase's staggering 38 P/S ratio is about the only chart you need to take a pass on this stock at its current price. It is nearly quadruple the 10.6 P/S ratio of its rival SolarEdge. And it's higher than Nio and Tesla which surged over 1100% and 740% in 2020 respectively.

The P/S ratio is the market capitalization of a stock divided by its revenue. Put another way imagine if you had a coffee shop that earned $100000 a year in revenue and the market valued your business at $3.8 million even though you're barely turning a profit. That's how much the market is valuing Enphase's growth so much so that it's willing to pay a premium price today because it believes in the future of the company.

But it's not just the high P/S ratio on its own that makes Enphase an expensive stock. It's also the fact that Enphase isn't growing revenue at the same pace it did in 2019. Comparing Enphase to other hyper-growth stocks like CrowdStrike or Zoom further outlines Enphase's lofty valuation. Although CrowdStrike and Zoom both have a higher P/S ratio than Enphase (61 and 59 respectively) they are growing revenue much faster than Enphase.

CrowdStrike is expected to double its revenue (again) in Fiscal Year 2021 whereas Zoom's P/S ratio is misleading because it factors in the company's first-half 2020 revenues which are a fraction of what it's earning today.

A league of its own

Enphase has found itself in uncharted territory (literally). Its valuation is multiples higher than that of other leading solar companies. Although it has one of the highest growth rates and gross margins in the sector 2020 revenue is expected to grow by just 22% year over year. 2021 will need to generate much higher revenue growth or Enphase's share price will need to come down before the company is worth considering. And there are other concerns as well. Enphase has picked up its profitability but it technically lost money in the second quarter of 2020. It is also compensating its employees with a fair amount of stock-based compensation which isn't shown in the non-GAAP numbers it tends to quote.

Enphase is a great company but an expensive stock. There are plenty of better solar stocks and wind stocks at more attractive valuations.

What Happened: In a statement Cohen said he was taking down the Twitter page because it had been ""overtaken this week by misinformation unrelated to the Mets that led to our family getting personal threats.""

In The Crossfire: Cohen got caught in the crossfire between the day traders who ran up GameStop's share prices and hedge funds racking up losses on short positions this week with traders viewing him as part of the Wall Street elite.

Point72 was among those funds. The firm reportedly lost 15% this year thanks to the GameStop spike. Point72 also on Monday said it was investing 0 million in Melvin Capital Management another GameStop short seller. It joined Citadel which invested $2 billion.‪

On Thursday he faced flak from the Twitter community and Reddit traders over his hedge fund’s bet. Cohen also engaged in a heated Twitter argument with Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy who accused Cohen of involvement with trading restrictions in GameStop.

Kelly Mi Li and Andrew Gray's relationship dynamic takes center stage in season 1 of Netflix's Bling Empire. But as Kelly revealed early on in the lavish reality show she was once married before meeting the Power Rangers Megaforce star.

""In my twenties I was married to a Chinese guy and we lived a privileged outrageous lifestyle” Kelly 35 explained during the show’s premiere episode. “You know seven cars four houses. I think at the time we were spending like 400000 a month on our black [American Express card] until one day the government showed up and took everything from us and my ex-husband was arrested.""

Who is Kelly Mi Li's ex-husband and what happened to him?

As hinted at in Bling Empire Kelly was once married to Lin Miao a founder and CEO of a texting company who was arrested for ""running one of the largest cyber scams in American history"" roughly 10 years ago. According to the Federal Trade Commission's website and the Los Angeles Business Journal Lin and his co-conspirators conducted a multi-million-dollar scam to charge text message services on consumers' bills without their permission.

The FTC complaint alleged that Lin and his partners used deceptive websites to collect consumers' phone numbers to bill them for the services. Customers were charged a rate of $9.99 per month and the charges were often concealed in a confusing form. When consumers tried to seek refunds some of the promised refunds never came through or customers only received partial refunds. Per the FBI Lin and his co-conspirators' fraud scheme amassed in excess of $50 million which was used to finance their lavish lifestyles.

According to The Sun Lin pled guilty and received supervised released for his cooperation with authorities. Kelly filed for divorce from Lin in November 2014. In May 2015 their divorce was finalized. According to Kelly the couple's assets were frozen and they gave the government roughly $168 million.

""I moved to Los Angeles for two reasons: One is to run away from a boy. Two is to chase a boy"" Kelly explained on the show before opening up about Andrew. "" ... he has a great heart. He’s very honest. [With] a lot of my past relationships trust has always been an issue.""



Recently Kelly confirmed during the Bling Empire: Where Are They Now special that she and Andrew are back together after breaking up briefly in season 1.

Read this article on the Outside app available now on iOS devices for members! Download the app .

For two very different experiences just 90 minutes apart combine southern Utah’s Zion National Park and Bryce Canyon National Park on a single road trip. Camping inside the parks can be great especially during the shoulder seasons. But if a hot shower and comfortable bed sound appealing book a dreamy Airbnb not far from the parks’ entrances. We rounded up some of our favorites ranging from a tiny house with a killer hot tub to a solar-powered retreat on an apple orchard.

The Modern Home

(Courtesy Airbnb)

This contemporary two-bedroom solar-powered home (from $239) located on a 14-acre apple farm in Glendale about 25 minutes east of Zion National Park and less than an hour southwest of Bryce Canyon National Park sleeps up to nine. Come nightfall a fire pit on the rooftop deck makes for the ideal hangout. The hosts also rent a collection of five tiny houses (from $103) on the property—perfect if you have friends joining you.

The Tiny House

(Courtesy Airbnb)

You could sleep up to four in this one-bedroom tiny house (from $338) set on a 75-acre property on the outskirts of Virgin about 20 minutes from Zion and two hours from Bryce but it’s best suited for one or two people. You’ll spend most of your time outside stargazing from beside the fire pit or soaking in the world’s dreamiest hot tub. Be sure to request fresh eggs from the chickens on-site to be delivered for your breakfast.

The Vintage Trailer

(Courtesy Airbnb)

You’ll sleep soundly in this cozy off-the-grid vintage trailer (from $111) situated atop a remote mesa about ten minutes outside Zion’s southern entrance. The camper a renovated 1990 Fleetwood Wilderness has a queen bed and a sofa sleeper. Bonus: your host Shanti Hodges founder of the organization Hike It Baby and co-owner of hiking outfit Wild Utah Tours can offer just-right suggestions on where to trek and and what to explore within the park.

The Loft

(Courtesy Airbnb)

This second-story two-bedroom apartment (from $332) is just steps from the southern entrance to Zion in the town of Springdale. The loft is decorated in a Southwestern bohemian style with colorful wall paint and eccentric art and bedding. The best part? It’s upstairs from Café Soleil which serves the tastiest breakfast burrito in town.

The Tent

(Courtesy Airbnb)

Part of a glamping outfit called Wander Camp this sleek canvas tent (from $104) comes outfitted with a king bed or two twins. Communal bathrooms are a short walk away. You’ll be off the grid—there’s no electricity limited cell service definitely no Wi-Fi—and located on a stunning plateau down a rugged dirt road about 25 minutes from Zion.

The Cabin

(Courtesy Airbnb)

Post up in one of these rustic and quaint cabins (from $150) less than a mile from Zion’s eastern entrance and you’ll have easy access to the park but none of the crowds or bustle of staying right in town. The tiny 400-square-foot wood-paneled accommodations have a queen bed plus a sleeping loft.

The Sanctuary

(Courtesy Airbnb)

Part of a vacation-rental complex called Nama-Stay this laid-back lodging regularly hosts yoga and meditation retreats (there’s a dedicated space on-site). The newly added studio-size guest suite (from $195) is perfect for one or two people but friends could stay in the neighboring properties. Located in downtown Springdale it’s an easy walk to shops and restaurants.

The Whole B&B

(Courtesy Airbnb)

Traveling with a group? This entire six-bedroom bed-and-breakfast (from $600) can be rented for up to 16 people. Located in Tropic it’s just seven miles to the gateway of Bryce Canyon National Park. And like a real B&B a hearty cooked breakfast comes included. The property was remodeled in 2020.

The Cliff House

(Courtesy Airbnb)

This stunning newly constructed house (from $214) is perched on a cliff on a 160-acre ranch outside the town of Escalante about an hour east of Bryce Canyon and two and a half hours from Zion. Built in 2019 the three-bedroom 2200-square-foot masterpiece sleeps up to ten and has striking views of the Escalante River and surrounding mountains from its rooftop deck.

The Studio

(Courtesy Airbnb)

A charming studio apartment (from $140) that’s part of a bed-and-breakfast inn now under new ownership this pad in Tropic is ten miles from Bryce Canyon. Unlike a lot of properties in this area the Wi-Fi is actually fast enough to work remotely from here. You’ll have your own garden entrance a queen bed and a loft that sleeps up to three comfortably.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZm9xLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvMDEvYWlyYm5iLWd1YXJkcmFpbHMtY2hhbmdlLWltcGFjdC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Airbnb: Using Guardrails to Identify Changes with Negative Impact across Teams,"Airbnb rolled out an internal Experiment Guardrails system to identify potentially negative impacts of changes across different teams. Whenever a proposed change does not pass any of the guardrails it is escalated for further analysis by affected teams and stakeholders explains Airbnb data scientist Tatiana Xifara.

Airbnb Guardrails system aims to prevent a team from launching a change in production that while improving that team's own metrics could have a negative impact on different metrics relevant to other teams at Airbnb. This is a scenario that is typical of large organizations where each team focuses on a specific set of goals e.g. fraud detection customer satisfaction overall revenue etc. and where it might not be always evident what kind of cross-team trade-offs a change may have.

As it currently stands Xifara explains Airbnb Guardrails systems includes three guardrails that account for different statistical dimensions of the effects of a proposed change: impact power and statistically significative negative shortened to stat sig negative.

Briefly the impact guardrail ensures that the metric does not percentually decrease below a given escalation threshold t . The power guardrail aims to ensure the experiment is run long enough so its results are statistically significant. This is expressed by requiring that the standard error is less than a given fraction F of t  e.g. StdErr < 0.8 * t . Finally the stat sig negative guardrail can be used to ensure any statistically significative negative impact on a given metric as small as it may be is escalated. This guardrail provides a further guarantee for especially sensitive metrics such as revenue where even minimal decreases could generate huge effects.

Airbnb Guardrails system is based on a few arbitrary constants that will determine its performance. Two of them are the escalation threshold t and the fraction F of t that is used by the power guardrail.

While t is easy to understand since it relates directly to the metric it is applied to for example the page load time F requires some additional consideration. If you choose a lower value for F  you will need to run the experiment longer so it is exposed to a higher number of users. This could make your experiment impractical to run or make it impact negatively your development speed.

Another aspect to look into is the fact that not all experiments will have the same global coverage which is the percentage of users assigned to an experiment. Lower-coverage experiments would need thus to run longer than higher-coverage ones if they had to pass the same power guardrail. To make all experiments complete in a similar time then the escalation threshold t can be defined as a function of the global coverage allowing t to be higher for a smaller coverage.

According to Xifara Airbnb Guardrails system flags about 25 experiment per month. Upon escalation and review roughly 20% of those i.e. 5 are eventually stopped. What is key is choosing all constants to strike a balance between metrics safeguard and speed of development.

It goes without saying that the Guardrails system is not restricted to any specific set of metrics and that each organization will have its own set of metrics to constantly keep an eye on. Xifara and Andersen's article includes much more information than what can be covered here so do not miss it if you are interested in the details.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vNy1lbGV2ZW4tbHV4dXJ5LXN0b3JlLXRleGFzLWFpcmJuYi1wbGF5c3RhdGlvbi01LWdhbWluZy1leHBlcmllbmNlLTIwMjEtMdIBbWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vNy1lbGV2ZW4tbHV4dXJ5LXN0b3JlLXRleGFzLWFpcmJuYi1wbGF5c3RhdGlvbi01LWdhbWluZy1leHBlcmllbmNlLTIwMjEtMT9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,7-Eleven 'luxury' store in Texas is an Airbnb PlayStation 5 gaming experience,"7-Eleven is turning its new Evolution Store in Texas into a PlayStation 5 gaming experience.

FOUNDED: 2008

HEADQUARTERS: Santa Monica

CEO: Robert Kotick

BUSINESS: Video gaming

EMPLOYEES: 9200 (Q4 2019)

MARKET CAP: $72.2 billion

REVENUE: $1.95 billion (Q3 2020)



NEED TO KNOW: Long before 2008 when Activision Blizzard Inc. formed out of the merger of Activision Inc. and Vivendi Games Los Angeles was a major hub for the video game industry. The combination of these gaming leaders created an industry juggernaut and what is now one of the most valuable companies in L.A.



Video games surged in popularity last year and Activision Blizzard reaped the benefits with revenue for the first three quarters of 2020 up 26% over the same period in 2019.



In the year’s final quarter Activision Blizzard released new titles in its signature “Call of Duty” and “World of Warcraft” series and in January the company’s market capitalization hit an all-time high.



The game publisher found success over the last two years with mobile and free-to-play versions of popular games like “Call of Duty.” In an October earnings call Chief Executive Robert Kotick said this would be a key part of the company’s efforts to maximize the popularity of its valuable franchises.



Kotick also said the company is looking for new ways to capitalize on the success of “Candy Crush” the addictive mobile game Activision Blizzard added to its list of franchises with the 2016 acquisition of King Digital Entertainment.



QUOTABLE: “As the community engages they consume more content” Kotick said. “More players are purchasing premium content than ever before and these growth rates highlight the tremendous power of the combination of our premium and free-to-play business model.”

Snap Inc.

FOUNDED: 2011

HEADQUARTERS: Santa Monica

CEO: Evan Spiegel

BUSINESS: Social media

EMPLOYEES: 3195 (Q4 2019)

MARKET CAP: $79.9 billion

REVENUE: $679 million (Q3 2020)



NEED TO KNOW: Gone are the days when investors worried about Snap Inc.’s disappointing initial public offering and wondered whether the company’s signature mobile app Snapchat would lose users to Instagram. Snap’s value more than doubled in 2020 as the company rolled out new features and expanded its library of original games and streaming content.



In the third quarter of 2020 Snap reported a user growth rate of 18% year over year and a revenue total more than 50% higher than the same period a year earlier Snap then took on rival TikTok directly with the launch of a feature called Spotlight which allows users to share short videos publicly and to collect monetary rewards when clips go viral.



Chief Executive Evan Spiegel said the company’s solid growth numbers stem from a focus on development of new user features and assuring solid returns on investment for advertisers.



In its quest to develop more in-app features Snap has partnered with third-party software developers and startups many of them based in the L.A. area. In 2018 the company launched an incubator for budding creators of digital content. Last year Snap rolled out another program called Yellow Collabs in which participating companies worked with Snap to design new features and tools for app users.



QUOTABLE: “The revenue and community growth we have generated as a result of these efforts has afforded us the opportunity to double down and innovate even more especially around our camera and augmented reality platform” Spiegel said on a call with investors.

Google

PARENT COMPANY: Alphabet Inc.

FOUNDED: 1998

LARGEST L.A. OFFICE: Playa Vista

CEO: Sundar Pichai

BUSINESS: Internet services

L.A. EMPLOYEES: Approximately 1000

NEED TO KNOW: All of the “big five” tech companies have offices in the Los Angeles area but Google is poised to be a major player locally once employees return to physical office locations.



Google and its parent company Alphabet Inc. already had a significant Silicon Beach presence in 2018 when it added 450000 square feet of office space in a converted Playa Vista airplane hangar that once housed Howard Hughes’ enormous Spruce Goose aircraft.



Only a few months later Google signed a lease to take over most of the former Westside Pavilion shopping mall in West Los Angeles. The company is tentatively expected to move into the nearly 600000-square-foot space in 2022 though Google reportedly told employees last year that its offices won’t reopen until September 2021 at the earliest.



By expanding its presence in Los Angeles Google is putting itself in a good position to capitalize on the high volume of future tech employees produced by local colleges and universities. Only three other U.S. cities — New York; Washington D.C.; and Boston — produce more tech degrees annually according to a CBRE Group Inc. report released last summer.



QUOTABLE: Mayor Eric Garcetti has touted Google’s Los Angeles presence as a key contributor to the growth of the city’s tech sector. “This investment in our city our economy and our people helps L.A. continue to create tech jobs faster than any other city in America” he said when Google opened its Playa Vista office.

Riot Games Inc.

PARENT COMPANY: Tencent Holdings Ltd.

FOUNDED: 2006

HEADQUARTERS: Sawtelle

CEO: Nicolo Laurent

BUSINESS: Video gaming

EMPLOYEES: 2500

NEED TO KNOW: It may not be obvious to casual observers but Riot Games is at the heart of a rapidly growing esports industry for which Los Angeles is the U.S. capital.



The video game publisher released its first title “League of Legends” in 2009 and has spent more than a decade developing a now-massive fanbase around the game and the players who compete in it professionally.



Livestreams of the 2020 League of Legends World Championship in Shanghai garnered more than 45 million peak concurrent viewers according to Riot Games.



The company last year launched a new game “Valorant” as well as a league of professional teams to foster an esports fan base around the title. Even before its official release the game attracted more than 3 million daily players in a testing period the company said.



Riot’s success has buoyed other Los Angeles companies in the esports industry including the owners of professional franchises like SoloMid Corp. broadcasters such as Super League Gaming Inc. and amateur competition organizer Play Versus Inc.



QUOTABLE: “Our Platform Group has built the infrastructure needed to take us from a single game on a single platform to a limitless future with multiple games across multiple platforms all able to interact with each other seamlessly” said Riot Chief Operating Officer Scott Gelb last year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy93YXRjaC1vbHltcGljLWd5bW5hc3QtY3J1c2hlZC1maXJzdC0xNDQ4MDA4ODkuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Watch an Olympic Gymnast Get Crushed by His First Bodybuilding Workout,"From Men's Health

He may have formally announced his retirement from the world of competitive gymnastics this month but Olympic medalist Nile Wilson is still pushing himself to his physical limits in different ways. In a recent guest appearance on fellow fitness YouTuber Mike Thurston's channel Nile tagged along to the gym on leg day and attempted his first ever bodybuilding session.

""I've never done bodybuilding but to be able to understand people's knowledge and how Mike creates his physique... for me it's always been about how good a gymnast I am and what tricks I can do so now that I'm retired I'm just buzzing to get involved in different types of training"" he says.

Mike starts Nile out with a hack squat which soon lets the gymnast know what kind of intensity level he can expect to be working at: ""I've done one exercise and I can't walk!""

Next they work on engaging the hamstrings and glutes with the Romanian deadlift with Mike ensuring Nile has got the right technique and noting that half of the challenge of this move comes from using the core for much-needed stability.

""I feel dizzy and sick"" says Nile adding how much he admires the dedication that bodybuilders have to put into their training. ""I've been an athlete myself and I think until you really start getting that consistency over a long period of time that's when you're going to get some results. There's no magic pill or one session that's going to change your life.""

Then they hit up some leg extensions and lying leg curls before calling it a day. ""My legs have never felt like this"" says Nile.

""That was a great effort"" says Mike. ""Not once did he quit. He kept pushing himself.""

Zuckerberg ""reached out to talk about the code and the impact on Facebook"" and a constructive discussion followed last week between the social media billionaire Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg and communications minister Paul Fletcher.

""No Mark Zuckerberg didn't convince me to back down if that's what you're asking"" Frydenberg told the Australian Broadcasting Corp without giving further details of the meeting.

A Facebook spokeswoman in Australia said the company's executives regularly meet with government stakeholders on a range of topics.

""We're actively engaging with the Australian government with the goal of landing on a workable framework to support Australia's news ecosystem"" she said.

Australia intends to introduce a law that would force Facebook the world's largest social media platform and internet search giant Google Inc to negotiate payments to media companies whose content drives traffic to their websites. If the parties cannot agree on payments a government-appointed arbitrator will set the fees for them.

Facebook and Google oppose the ""News Media Bargaining Code"" and have mounted public campaigns against it. Google has threatened to withdraw its search engine from Australia while Facebook has warned it would stop Australians sharing news content on its site if the laws go ahead.

At a Senate inquiry into the planned law this month local heads of both companies outlined their opposition to the plans which would be among the toughest in the world in dealing with the financial impact of global internet companies on domestic media which have been hit by shrinking advertising revenue.

""We're told that if we go ahead with this we're going to break the internet"" Frydenberg said on the ABC.

""What I do know is that media businesses should be paid for content.""

Zuckerberg ""reached out to talk about the code and the impact on Facebook"" and a constructive discussion followed last week between the social media billionaire Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg and communications minister Paul Fletcher.

""No Mark Zuckerberg didn't convince me to back down if that's what you're asking"" Frydenberg told the Australian Broadcasting Corp without giving further details of the meeting.

A Facebook spokeswoman in Australia said the company's executives regularly meet with government stakeholders on a range of topics.

""We're actively engaging with the Australian government with the goal of landing on a workable framework to support Australia's news ecosystem"" she said.

Australia intends to introduce a law that would force Facebook the world's largest social media platform and internet search giant Google Inc to negotiate payments to media companies whose content drives traffic to their websites. If the parties cannot agree on payments a government-appointed arbitrator will set the fees for them.

Facebook and Google oppose the ""News Media Bargaining Code"" and have mounted public campaigns against it. Google has threatened to withdraw its search engine from Australia while Facebook has warned it would stop Australians sharing news content on its site if the laws go ahead.

At a Senate inquiry into the planned law this month local heads of both companies outlined their opposition to the plans which would be among the toughest in the world in dealing with the financial impact of global internet companies on domestic media which have been hit by shrinking advertising revenue.

""We're told that if we go ahead with this we're going to break the internet"" Frydenberg said on the ABC.

""What I do know is that media businesses should be paid for content.""

That’s up sharply from 703 departments in 2019 and just 40 in 2018.

The FT reports that local law enforcement departments on the platform asked for Ring videos for a total of more than 22335 incidents in 2020. The disclosure data from Ring also shows that law enforcement made some 1900 requests — such as subpoenas search warrants and court orders— for footage or data from Ring cameras even after the device owner has denied the request. Amazon complied with such requests 57 percent of the time its figures show down from 68 percent in 2019.

Privacy advocates have raised concerns about how Ring data is used by and made available to law enforcement. Ring’s Neighbors app which allows Ring users to share videos with others nearby has been criticized for containing racist comments and reports. And a report from NBC News last February found that Ring footage wasn’t all that helpful for solving crimes. When it was useful the Ring footage was mostly used for low-level non-violent property crimes (like the theft of a Nintendo Switch).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxLzEvMzAvaHVuZHJlZHMtcHJvdGVzdC1hZ2FpbnN0LWFtYXpvbi1leHBhbnNpb24taW4tZnJhbmNl0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYWxqYXplZXJhLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy8yMDIxLzEvMzAvaHVuZHJlZHMtcHJvdGVzdC1hZ2FpbnN0LWFtYXpvbi1leHBhbnNpb24taW4tZnJhbmNl?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,France: Hundreds protest against Amazon expansion,"Demonstrators form human chain as they rally against Amazon’s plan to set up facility in small southern town of Fournes.

Hundreds of people have rallied in several French towns and cities in protests called by anti-capitalist and environmental groups against e-commerce giant Amazon.

Among the places where demonstrators staged rallies on Saturday was the small southern town of Fournes near Pont-du-Gard a World Heritage site where the United States-based company plans to set up a 38000-square-metre (400000-square-feet) facility.

Protesting at the site between 800 and 1000 people formed a human chain to show the size of the project with multicoloured balloons floated 18 metres (60 feet) up to indicate the height of the planned five-storey warehouse.

“It’s two years that the citizens of Fournes and its surroundings have fought against the installation of a giant Amazon warehouse” said Raphael Pradeau spokesman of French citizens’ activist group Attac.

“At the start they were a bit alone against everyone but they have succeeded in halting the project thanks to legal recourse” he added.

“We want to show that these are not small isolated fights and that we can mobilise hundreds of people who are ready to return to stop the work” said Pradeau.

‘Destructive model’

The campaigners view the retail giant as a prime factor in the urbanisation of farmland a process they say is contributing significantly to climate change and the loss of environmental biodiversity.

Amazon’s global revenues have soared during the pandemic and its ability to keep selling during coronavirus lockdowns has deepened frustration among French opponents who say it represents a US-style mass consumer culture at odds with a long local tradition of neighbourhood stores.

The protesters also planted shrubs in front of huge banners reading “Stop Amazon” and “Not here or anywhere”.

“These plants these shrubs that we are planting today are a symbol of life that contrasts with the concretisation that Amazon practises” said 38-year-old Sarah Latour 38 who had brought her two sons aged six and eight.

“I came with my children because I don’t want this destructive model for them” she told AFP news agency.

About 200 people also rallied outside an Amazon facility in Carquefou a suburb of the western city of Nantes organisers said.

“We condemn Amazon for destroying more jobs than they create” said Sophie Jallier a spokeswoman for the organisers in Carquefou.

Other protests were reported in the eastern towns of Ensisheim and Augny.

Reacting to similar demonstrations last month Amazon said it had unwittingly become the mouthpiece of organisations that often made use of “misleading” information. It had invested 9.2 billion euros ($11.2bn) in France and was “at the origin of” the creation of 130000 jobs a spokeswoman said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vYXdzLmFtYXpvbi5jb20vYmxvZ3MvYXJjaGl0ZWN0dXJlL2J1aWxkaW5nLW11bHRpLXBhcnRuZXItaW50ZWdyYXRpb24tb24tYXdzLXVzaW5nLWV2ZW50LWRyaXZlbi1hcmNoaXRlY3R1cmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Building Multi-partner integration on AWS using Event-Driven Architecture | Amazon Web Services,"September 8 2021: Amazon Elasticsearch Service has been renamed to Amazon OpenSearch Service.

Summary

Finserv MARKETS enables customers to buy financial services products such as credit cards loans insurance and investments from various partners. Finserv MARKETS integrates with a large number of partners in real time to provide services to customers.

Each partner has their own semantic APIs which can pose a challenge. There are also issues of latency and failures. We’ll show how our solution based on Event Driven Architecture (EDA) on AWS with Reactive design offers a solution to address these challenges.

Challenges with multi-partner integration

Latency – Making API calls to multiple partners increases latency of a service even in the scenario in which the calls are made in parallel.

– Making API calls to multiple partners increases latency of a service even in the scenario in which the calls are made in parallel. Timeouts – If a partner’s APIs time out this could impact overall service performance and availability.

– If a partner’s APIs time out this could impact overall service performance and availability. Failures – A partner API failure could lead to the failure or major performance degradation of the overall service.

– A partner API failure could lead to the failure or major performance degradation of the overall service. Customer Experience – Preserving the customer experience when depending on partner integration is a challenge considering these technical issues.

Conceptual solution

In order to build this multi-partner platform we discussed using traditional command-driven synchronous architecture. We also considered adopting an Event-Driven Architecture (EDA). Building our solution on EDA enabled us to deliver consistent customer experience while addressing failures and performance issues from partner APIs.

The diagram following shows a conceptual view of the solution:

The key components of the solution are:

1. User Interface: It is the single page application running on the user’s browser. For example the UI makes an API call to business services to calculate insurance premiums with required parameters and receives a unique identifier. This enables the UI to be reactive and display the responses from the partner as they arrive.

2. Business Service: A microservice which provides APIs for:

• The user interface to submit and generate events for request for partner offer

• A callback to submit the response from the partner integration service in a reactive manner

3. Event Bus: The event bus infrastructure enables transportation routing and delivery of events to the right services. The business service raises a set of events to the event bus for a quote request. There is one event for each partner that is listened to by the reactive services.

4. Reactive Services: Services that consume events and call partner integration services for the calling partner API. On receiving the partner response it calls the callback API on the business service. These services are organized by product domain (for example Motor Insurance).

5. Partner Integration Service: This service is responsible for integration with partners. The service translates the canonical request to partner-specific API calls. The service implements partner-specific security and error handling. There is one partner integration service per partner.

Realizing this solution on AWS

Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers cloud-native services enabling us to realize this solution.

We used the following services to implement this architecture:

User Interface

We built the load balancing interface in Angular and host it on Apache Web Servers running Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS). Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) distributes traffic evenly across the containers. Running a container gives us the required flexibility and scalability needed.

Business Service

The business service is a microservice built using Spring Boot and running on Amazon ECS containers. It uses an ELB used for service load balancing. The choice of Spring Boot and Amazon ECS gives flexibility and scalability through cluster auto scaling.

Data Store

We use polyglot architecture for data storage. For different product journeys and depending on data lifecycle we choose either Amazon Aurora Postgres or Amazon ElastiCache for Redis. This gives us the right mix of performance and required durability for each business use case.

Event Bus

We evaluated Amazon Kinesis and Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) and came to the conclusion that for our volume and use cases Amazon SNS offers the right capability. We implemented this by defining topics for example a four-wheeler insurance quote. This topic is subscribed by reactive services for each partner integration where the partner service is called and a quote is generated. For downstream functionality where the API is to be called of the selected partner (for example insurance policy issuance or credit card application submission) we chose Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS). Amazon SQS provides simple queuing for asynchronous processing.

Reactive Services

These services are built using two different technologies. Spring Boot microservice running in an Amazon ECS container and AWS Lambda functions. Spring Boot is chosen due to our team’s familiarity of this technology; however our plan is to move completely towards usage of Lambda functions for all asynchronous reactive services.

Partner Integration Service

Partner integration services provides the abstraction layer between partner API and canonical API and is called by reactive services synchronously. In some cases the error is passed back to reactive service to decide on retry. In other cases for example a policy issuance API retry is built into this service using exponential backoff strategy.

Partner API tracking

Partner API tracking gives us the right way of tracking the partner request and proactively address failures. We use Amazon Elasticsearch Service and Kibana for tracking. We can implement a circuit breaker pattern to shut down any partner for a period of time should failures reach a given threshold.

How this solution addresses multi-partner integration

This solution is built on the foundation of Event Driven Architecture with reactive design and is able to address the following challenges:

Latency

Since the user interface asynchronously polls for the response it receives the partner response as soon as it arrives. This makes the response latency on the fastest partner API rather than slowest.

Timeout

Timeouts are set in the UI for polling so if a partner API doesn’t respond we time it out without any degradation. These timeouts are set based on the established user experience benchmarks. For example how long do we let a user wait to see all insurance quotes before degrading their experience?

Failures

In case of an API failure the UI will time out. Our API tracking can also enable a circuit breaker pattern to take a partner offline in the event of persistent failures.

Customer Experience

The solution gives a consistent experience to the user. Users can make their choice from the partner quotes/offers in a reactive way as received rather than waiting for all offers to be shown. This design meets our customer requirements derived from our Voice of Customer (VoC) study sessions.

Conclusion

In the digital space APIs are the most common mechanism for system integration. Building a solution that is scalable resilient and provides the best customer experience is challenging. Event Driven Architecture with Reactive design offers a solution to address these issues. We process over 5000+ requests every day in Insurance and Credit domains. We’ve been able to achieve required availability of over 99.9% while maintaining a positive customer experience on this platform.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyYW5jZTI0LmNvbS9lbi9ldXJvcGUvMjAyMTAxMzAtYW50aS1jYXBpdGFsaXN0LWFuZC1lbnZpcm9ubWVudGFsLWdyb3Vwcy1wcm90ZXN0LWFtYXpvbi1leHBhbnNpb24taW4tZnJhbmNl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hundreds rally in protest against Amazon expansion in France,"Hundreds rallied in several French towns on Saturday in protests against Amazon called by anti-capitalist and environmental groups including at one site where the US e-commerce giant plans a massive warehouse.

Amazon plans to set up a 38000-square-metre (400000-square-feet) facility in the small southern town of Fournes near the Pont du Gard a Roman aqueduct bridge that is a World Heritage site.

While police said around 800 protesters took part in the protest there organisers said 1400 turned up. The protesters planted shrubs in front of huge banners reading ""Stop Amazon"" and ""Not here or anywhere"".

They formed a human chain to show the size of the project floating multi-coloured balloons 18 metres (60 feet) up to indicate the height of the planned five-storey facility.

""It's two years that the citizens of Fournes and its surroundings have fought against the installation of a giant Amazon warehouse"" said Raphael Pradeau spokesman for French citizens' activist group Attac.

""We want to show that these are not small isolated fights and that we can mobilise hundreds of people who are ready to return to stop the work"" said Pradeau.

'Precarious jobs'

Sarah Latour 38 came with her two sons aged eight and six and the family planted a shrub in waste ground where vines had once grown.

""These plants these shrubs that we are planting today are a symbol of life that contrasts with the concreting that Amazon practises"" she said.

""I came with my children because I don't want this destructive model for them.""

About 200 people also rallied outside an Amazon facility in Carquefou a suburb of the western city of Nantes organisers said.

""We condemn Amazon for destroying more jobs than they create and that these are insecure jobs"" said Sophie Jallier a spokeswoman for the organisers in Carquefou.

In the eastern town of Ensisheim about 100 people gathered to protest a plan to build a giant warehouse on a 15-hectare site of former agricultural land.

Banners read ""Amazon Fiscal Vampire"" and ""No mega warehouse.""

""Today we condemn an economic system that is at the end of its rope and which is using the planet"" said Isabelle Schaeffer a member of an environmental group in the Sud Alsace region.

Other protests were held in Augny in the eastern Moselle region and in Perpignan in the south.

Amazon practices ""unfair competition with regard to businesses that pay their taxes in France"" Eric Barbier of the environmental group Alteratiba said in Perpignan.

In addition ""most workers are on precarious contracts hired during peak periods such as Black Friday or Christmas and are then thrown out"".

Amazon France issued a statement saying it had ""become the target of certain organisations that want to make the causes they represent known"".

More than 11000 French entrepreneurs relied on Amazon to develop their activities and create jobs it added and the company itself employed 9300 people on competitive salaries with excellent career opportunities it added.

The report begins by discussing how Mike Frazzini was brought in to start Amazon Game Studios eight years ago without ever making a game. Since then Frazzini and Amazon Game Studios have released only two games and have seen multiple cancelled projects that were attempting to recreate the financial magic of games like Fortnite and League of Legends. The Grand Tour Game was the first Amazon Game Studios console release and within a year it was removed from storefronts. Crucible was the next game released from the studio and not only did it return to closed beta after its official launch Two other projects which were known as Intensity and Nova never saw the light of day after the teams tried and failed to create games inspired by Fortnite and League of Legends respectively.

All of these cancelled and unsuccessful projects at Amazon Game Studios have done so despite Amazon spending nearly $500 million a year operating the game division. It's also important to note that the amount doesn't include Twitch or Amazon Luna - the latter of which is under different management.Frazzini is an ""Amazon lifer"" who started his career in the books section of Amazon.com where he ""endeared himself to Jeff Bezos as a manager there."" He began his role as head of the games division by bringing in some of the best game development talent in the world including Portal's Kim Swift Far Cry 2's Clint Hocking Madden's Richard Hilleman and Everquest's John Smedley. Today only Smedley remains.According to numerous current and former employees of Frazzini's game studios he continuously ignored much of the advice given by these experienced developers and despite frequently telling the staff that every Amazon game should be a ""billion-dollar franchise"" he would then understaff projects.Furthermore instead of using industry-leading game engines like Unreal Engine or Unity the studio opted to license technology from Crytek to create a homemade engine known as Lumberyard.

While Lumberyard was meant to integrate with Amazon Web Services and could have been a cheaper alternative than paying for the other engines it ended up being known as a ""boogeyman around the office."" Many cited that it was ""painfully slow"" and developers would play Halo or watch Amazon Prime Video as they waited for Lumberyard to process art or compile code. One former employee even went so far as to say ""Lumberyard is killing this company.""Another big issue with working at Amazon Game Studios is said to be linked to the ""bro culture"" that has been cultivated there in which women were often not given the same opportunities as men. Beyond that ""four female game developers said that their worst experiences of sexism in the industry were at Amazon.""There were stories of them being ignored and undermined by male executives in some cases being driven out of the company. One source said that not only did a male on the senior leadership team impede her career growth after she disagreed with him he would then go on to create new management positions above her and hired men to take those positions.Amazon's game problems also extend to how they incentivize their employees. While most studios pay bonuses based on the critical and commercial response of a game Amazon's stock plan only rewards employees for how long they have been at the company. This has led to some employees choosing to ""prioritize job preservation over anything else say three former employees.""

New World Screenshots: November 2020 6 Images

Amazon Game Studio's next project is the MMO New World. Originally planned for a 2020 release it was pushed back to Spring 2021 to improve the quality of the game. Bloomberg's report explains that the project was originally going to be a survival game where players would take on the role of colonists in a fictional version of 1600s America.The problem however was that the enemies players originally were going to face ""looked a lot like indigenous people."" When developers pointed out to Frazzini's deputy Patrick Gilmore that the setting and villains could be considered racist he ""expressed disbelief.""Amazon did eventually hire a tribal consultant who did find that the portrayal was offensive and the Native American imagery has since been removed. Our latest preview of New World's high-level PvE zone show a game that may not be for everybody but one that shows promise and a big improvement in both PvE content and general polish from the previous build.

The southbound sector now departs at 9:30PM and arrives in Rio de Janeiro the following morning at 9:15AM. You can find the original post below.

If this is accurate I’m going to go out on a limb and say that this will be the most oddly timed flight operated by a US airline.

American resuming New York to Rio flights

American and JetBlue have launched a new Northeast partnership and as part of this American plans on launching several new long haul international flights out of New York JFK. The first two destinations to be announced were Athens and Tel Aviv but now American has opened bookings for another route.

American Airlines plans to launch daily New York to Rio de Janeiro flights as of December 16 2021. The route will be operated by a Boeing 777-200ER with the following schedule:

AA2842 New York to Rio de Janeiro departing 2:59PM arriving 2:59AM (+1 day)

AA974 Rio de Janeiro to New York departing 12:01AM arriving 8:00AM

The ~4800 mile flight is blocked at roughly 10 hours in each direction. This will be American’s third “deep” South America destination out of New York JFK (after Buenos Aires and Sao Paulo) and it also represents a service resumption as American operated this route in the past.

What is up with the southbound flight timing?

The timing of that southbound flight is truly bizarre. The flight departs around 3PM and lands around… 3AM.

Let me of course note that in some parts of the world (like the Middle East and India) 3AM is a busy time for airlines. However historically flights between the US and South America have either been proper redeyes or in some cases daytime flights.

I would be hard pressed to think of a worse schedule:

This has none of the benefits of a daytime flight (being able to sleep in a bed at your destination)

This has none of the benefits of a redeye flight (being able to not “waste” a day since you still have to be at the airport in the early afternoon)

I simply can’t make sense of American’s schedule here. When I first saw this I assumed that maybe American was operating an early daytime flight on the northbound sector but nope the airline is operating a redeye there.

Furthermore this isn’t about some sort of an aircraft swap with another route in Rio de Janeiro since the only other American flight in the schedule is out of Miami and that schedule isn’t complementary. The aircraft utilization here is terrible as the plane will sit on the ground in Rio de Janeiro for 21 hours.

That leads me to a few possible explanations:

American decided that this would be the optimal departure time in terms of connectivity beyond JFK

American thinks customers prefer a quasi-daytime flight that lands at 3AM (where you’d probably get to your hotel at 5AM)

There’s something here I’m missing like some cargo benefit for landing at that hour

This is actually just a mistake

I’m talking to sources to try to figure out which explanation is correct but as an avgeek I couldn’t help but draw some attention to this unique schedule and open this up to speculation.

Bottom line

American Airlines will be resuming daily flights between New York and Rio de Janeiro as of December 2021. This is American’s third new or resumed long haul route out of New York since the JetBlue partnership was announced so that’s exciting.

However the timing of the New York to Rio de Janeiro flight is easily the strangest schedule I’ve seen for any flight operated by a US airline. Maybe it will get adjusted (or corrected) but in the meantime it’s a fun mystery.

Can anyone think of a stranger schedule for a flight operated by a US airline? And what do you think — what’s the explanation for this schedule or is it a mistake?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLGh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS83MzctbWF4LWZpdmUteWVhcnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Five Years Ago The Boeing 737 MAX Made Its Maiden Flight,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLGh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS83MzctbWF4LWZpdmUteWVhcnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9tYXJrZXRzL3JvYmluaG9vZC1uYXJyb3dzLXN0b2NrLXRyYWRlLXJlc3RyaWN0aW9uc9IBUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9tYXJrZXRzL3JvYmluaG9vZC1uYXJyb3dzLXN0b2NrLXRyYWRlLXJlc3RyaWN0aW9ucy5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Robinhood narrows stock trade restrictions,"Robinhood has narrowed its stock trade restrictions from 50 to eight companies on Sunday including GameStop Koss Corporation AMC Entertainment Holdings Express Inc.

The stock restrictions were put in place as the mobile brokerage app confronted high trading volume over the past week. The high volatility was spurred by a speculative investing discussion forum on Reddit called WallStreetBets. The group of Reddit users banded together to buy up GameStop's call options causing the struggling retailer's shares to soar to unprecedented levels and hurting market short-sellers. The group then proceeded to target other heavily-shorted stocks.

Robinhood co-founder Vladimir Tenev said in a Twitter thread on Thursday that as a brokerage firm the company has many financial requirements including ""SEC net capital obligations and clearinghouse deposits"" which fluctuate based on market volatility and exist to ""protect investors and the markets.""

""It was not because we wanted to stop people from buying these stocks"" Robinhood added in a blog post. ""We did this because the required amount we had to deposit with the clearinghouse was so large—with individual volatile securities accounting for hundreds of millions of dollars in deposit requirements—that we had to take steps to limit buying in those volatile securities to ensure we could comfortably meet our requirements.""

The Securities and Exchange Commission said on Friday that it is monitoring developments and will “act to protect retail investors when the facts demonstrate abusive or manipulative trading activity that is prohibited by the federal securities laws.” In addition New York Attorney General Leticia James said she would launch her own review into the market activity.

The move has also prompted two separate lawsuits against the investing platform. The first lawsuit filed in the Southern District Court of New York alleges that Robinhood ""purposefully willingly and knowingly"" restricted certain securities transactions including GameStop. The other filed in the Northern District Court of Illinois alleges that the app manipulated its platform.

In addition Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has floated the possibility of an investigation into the matter by the House Financial Services Committee which has received bipartisan support from other lawmakers like Sen. Ted Cruz R-Texas and Congressman Ro Khanna D-Calif. as well as business leaders like Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Ocasio-Cortez added that the inquiry should ""not be solely limited to Robinhood.""

Other competitors who previously restricted securities include TD Ameritrade Charles Schwabb WeBull E*TRADE and Interactive Brokers.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer D-N.Y. said in a tweet Sunday evening that any SEC and Congressional investigations of decisions to restrict access to trade GameStop ""must happen ASAP.""

""We cannot have a stock market where palyers are also refs"" Schumer said.

Robinhood had to raise $1 billion from investors yesterday to help it cover cash demands during the week’s trading frenzy while traders and lawmakers sharply criticized the online broker for halting some trading in Reddit-touted stocks. In short: The consequences of the mania in GameStop AMC and other stocks are becoming more concrete — and in Robinhood’s case more serious.

The surge in trading forced Robinhood to raise cash. As waves of investors poured into the markets Wall Street’s central clearing hub the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation demanded billions more in collateral from brokerages to shield it from the volatility. Robinhood which had already drawn millions from its credit lines to meet margin requirements turned to existing investors for additional capital so it wouldn’t have to impose further limits on customer trades.

A more detailed explanation: Brokerages post money with the D.T.C.C. to cover customers’ transactions while they wait for the trades to settle. With such a big surge in trading the clearing hub wanted more assurance: “It’s the D.T.C.C. saying ‘This stuff is just too risky’ ” said the Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Larry Tabb.

Other online brokerages also cited the D.T.C.C. as a factor in decisions to impose trading restrictions.

Robinhood faces a loss of confidence from customers. After becoming the venue of choice for small investors the app risks alienating a core customer base — and feelings of betrayal over the trading limits may be harder to address than annoyance over technical outages. (Small groups of protesters gathered in New York and outside Robinhood’s Bay Area headquarters yesterday.) “Brokers are now ‘protecting’ customers as a facade so that they can appease their institutional backers” one individual trader told Bloomberg. “The entire community is outraged.”

Online rumor-mongering that the trading limits were done to help Wall Street titans — which Robinhood denies — isn’t helping the company’s case.

It’s also feeling the heat from Washington. An unlikely mix of lawmakers — including Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Ted Cruz — accused Robinhood of imposing trading limits to help out hedge funds caught out by the retail trading frenzy. The heads of the Senate Banking Committee and the House Financial Services Committee called for hearings. It poses a big challenge for Robinhood’s policy team including its chief legal officer Dan Gallagher a former S.E.C. commissioner.

Does the populism angle hold up? Though many traders and commentators — including The Times’s Kevin Roose — see the GameStop mania in part as an internet-enabled pushback against Wall Street elites financial bigwigs like the investment firm Silver Lake were among the big winners.“Are you entirely sure there aren’t wealthy people on both sides?” Senator Elizabeth Warren asked yesterday.

Earlier this week fans of American professional basketball team Miami Heat were able to watch their team compete in person for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic shut down the National Basketball Association (NBA) in March 2020. This was made possible thanks to a number of precautionary measures placed in the stadium including the presence of dogs that are trained to detect COVID-19 infections!

Only 2000 spectators—just 10% of American Airlines Arena’s capacity—were allowed to enter the stadium to watch Miami Heat take on the LA Clippers on Thursday January 28. And while maintaining social distancing and wearing masks was made mandatory at the venue the Miami-based outfit also became the first NBA team to use COVID-sniffing dogs as an added screening method.

The canine team guided two trained pups along the line of socially-distanced fans waiting to enter the arena and the dogs sniffed each person's hands.

""They can spot it (COVID-19) within seconds. Dogs are the most efficient mobile detection system"" explained Michael Larkin the vice president of the Global K9 Protection Group which managed the dogs. ""They are living breathing animals that have these incredible olfactory senses that are used across the world in a variety of environments.""

When these dogs detect the virus they indicate it to their handler by sitting down next to the individual in question. In such cases the potentially infected person and their companions would not be permitted to enter the game and their tickets would be refunded the team’s official website stated.

Advertisement Such canine teams have previously been tested in airports in Santiago Dubai and Helsinki and by police forces in Chile as well.

How do COVID-19-sniffing dogs work?

Back in 2020 researchers from Australia’s University of Adelaide collaborated with international partners to train sniffer dogs to detect COVID-19 infection. Their aim was to build on previous studies that have shown how dogs possess the ability to detect the presence of specific Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) caused by viral infections in people. These compounds tend to create specific scent imprints which trained dogs can sniff-out with high precision rates.

The training results were quite promising too with preliminary findings showing specialised dogs recording a 100% success rate in detecting COVID-19 VOCs in patients. There were also indications of dogs identifying infected individuals even before the development of any symptoms or in those individuals who were infected but asymptomatic.

Speaking of this training Dr Anne-Lise Chaber from the University of Adelaide's School of Animal and Veterinary Sciences had explained: “(These) dogs are trained in the same way as dogs that detect explosives. According to studies dogs are not susceptible to SARS-CoV2 and the virus cannot replicate in them. COVID-19 dog detectors will be a reliable repeatable cheap easy and fast way to screen or pre-screen potential cases.”

Is the Nation's Grid Up to It? (Published 2021),"Major automakers are increasingly betting that millions of new cars and trucks over the next decade will be plugged into electrical outlets not fueled up at gas stations. That raises a question: Is the nation’s power grid ready to handle this surge of new electric vehicles?

Today fewer than 1 percent of cars on America’s roads are electric. But a seismic shift is underway.

General Motors said Thursday that it aims to stop selling new gasoline-powered cars and light trucks by 2035 and will pivot to battery-powered vehicles. California’s governor has set a goal of phasing out sales of new combustion engines statewide in just 15 years. Automakers like Tesla Ford and Volkswagen plan to introduce dozens of new electric models in the years ahead spurred on by plummeting battery prices and concerns about climate change.

That shift will have sweeping implications for the companies that produce and sell electricity and manage the grid. Analysts generally agree that it is entirely feasible to power many millions of new cars with electricity but it will take careful planning.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVudGlmaWNhbWVyaWNhbi5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS93YW50LWdyZWVuZXItY2Fycy1mb2N1cy1vbi1mdWVsLWVmZmljaWVuY3kv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Want Greener Cars? Focus on Fuel Efficiency,"Electric cars are great but higher fuel economy for vehicles of all sizes is better

The following essay is reprinted with permission from The Conversation an online publication covering the latest research.

President Biden has proposed ambitious goals for curbing climate change and investing in a cleaner U.S. economy. One critical sector is transportation which generates 28% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions – more than either electric power production or industry.

Shifting from cars that run on gasoline and diesel to electric vehicles or EVs is a key strategy to address transportation’s contribution to global warming. Industry watchers expect big federal investments in charging stations and tax credits for electric cars. But as Biden’s Day One executive order on climate and the environment recognized an even greater priority is making gasoline vehicles more fuel-efficient.

My research focuses on energy problems including transportation and climate change. I believe though EVs are important it’s emissions from the entire automobile fleet – meaning vehicles of all types and sizes – that ultimately matter for climate. Motorcars stay on the road for a long time so failing to adequately reduce gasoline vehicle emissions this year burdens the atmosphere with excess carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) for many years ahead.

Electric cars in context

The media spotlight on EVs can lend them outsize importance in discussions of the car-climate challenge. Tesla’s leadership on electrification has boosted its stock to record levels. GM has made the news with its announcements of new EVs in the making and all major automakers worldwide now have ambitious EV plans.

Even after accounting for emissions caused by generating electricity to power them research shows that EVs clearly provide environmental benefits. They emit fewer pollutants that contribute to climate change and smog than gasoline-powered vehicles. And they avoid the environmental damage associated with drilling for oil refining it into gasoline and transporting it to filling stations.

For these reasons but especially because of EVs’ crucial role in cutting carbon California aims to require new cars and light trucks sold in the state to be all-electric by 2035. More than a dozen other states are adopting California’s clean-car strategies. Massachusetts recently announced its own plan to effectively ban sales of new gasoline-powered personal vehicles by 2035.

However EVs are not yet close to having a measurable net impact on CO 2 reduction. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s automotive trends report even as EVs have gained market share carbon-cutting progress has ground to a halt.

Why? The surging popularity of highly fuel-consumptive pickups and SUVs. Indeed EPA data show that to date higher emissions from the market shift to larger more powerful vehicles have swamped potential CO 2 reductions from electric vehicles by a factor of five.

The role of clean-car standards

To appreciate this conundrum it helps to understand how federal clean-car standards work. These regulations combine Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards with greenhouse gas emission standards. The two sets of rules are coordinated because cars that get more miles per gallon have lower CO 2 emission rates.

Both types of standards apply to automakers on a fleetwide basis. Therefore when automakers increase their sales of EVs and other high-efficiency vehicles they can sell a greater number of less fuel-efficient SUVs and pickup trucks while still meeting their fleet average greenhouse gas emission limits.

As a result each additional EV sold does not yield a net CO 2 reduction overall. In fact because EVs get extra credit under the standards electric car sales are now increasing fleet-average emissions to a level slightly higher than they would be without EVs in the mix.

Automakers also exploit flexibility provisions built into the regulations. For example a firm’s standard gets weaker when it makes its vehicles larger. On top of that vehicles classified as light trucks – including four-wheel-drive and large SUVs as well as vans and pickups – are held to weaker standards than those classified as cars.

In spite of this regulatory flexibility automakers lobbied the Trump administration to weaken clean-car standards that had been developed under the Obama administration. In response the Trump administration gutted the regulations in 2020. President Biden has directed federal agencies to revisit this issue but for now the weak existing standards mean that little carbon-cutting progress is on the horizon.

Real promises require legal obligation

Automakers recognize the future importance of electrification. Most major car manufacturers have pledged to bring a growing number of EVs to market. Nevertheless EVs still face many obstacles to widespread use including higher price tags and lower convenience for many consumers.

Even as EVs’ prices fall driving ranges rise and charging stations proliferate the time required to charge EVs will remain a barrier. It’s therefore unclear whether the pieces are in place for a rapid transition to an all-electric automotive future.

Adopting clean-car standards that grow progressively more stringent each year and require automakers to cut CO 2 emissions from all the vehicles they sell would ensure that technological promises translate to actual emission reductions. This approach underpinned the Obama administration’s 2012 standards which originally were designed to achieve a nearly 5% yearly average reduction in new-fleet CO 2 emission rates.

Some automakers seem to want to sidestep any serious obligation to meaningfully reduce emissions. General Motors has been on a publicity blitz about its EV plans but the company has been notably silent on restoring strong clean-car standards.

In contrast Ford Honda BMW and Volkswagen have cooperated with California to develop a plan more in line with climate protection needs. I would argue that even more stringent standards are needed to make up for lost time and put the fleet on track to a zero-carbon goal.

Although it’s not a good reason for weak standards automakers raise a valid concern when they point to weak marketwide interest in cleaner cars. Consumer demand for more efficient vehicles waxes and wanes with gasoline prices but there’s an ongoing need to continually reduce CO 2 emissions.

Although green groups and green-leaning policymakers have mounted extensive efforts to promote EVs there is no comparable level of effort to encourage consumers to choose greener gasoline vehicles. That’s a missing link in clean-car strategy.

In short to cut carbon from cars sooner rather than later it is crucial to greatly improve the fuel economy of the gasoline vehicles that will still be sold in the years ahead. This is especially true for the pickups and SUVs that comprise the highest-emitting part of the fleet. At the end of the day total emissions from the entire vehicle market matter much more for the planet than green niches glowing in the spotlight.

Back in the olden days when we used to go places I enjoyed travelling to visit my sister in Minneapolis. I would take lots of scenic pictures — lakes! — but inevitably I would take a photo like this:



Gas prices in Minneapolis on January 30 (Photo credit: Karen Listgarten)

It always amazed me how cheap gasoline was in Minnesota and in fact pretty much anywhere outside of California. This data from the US Energy Information Administration backs that up. We pay about a 40% price premium for gasoline.



We pay about 40% more for gasoline. Source: US CA SF

What I didn’t realize on all of those trips is that the gasoline prices in California are nothing compared to the electricity prices we pay here. (It did not occur to me to look at my sister’s electric bills!)



Our electricity prices are high! Source: US and CA PG&E (1)

We pay 47% more for electricity in California than in the US on average and an eye-popping 72% more in the Bay Area. Ouch. I wonder if we would be doing things differently if electricity prices were posted on signs just like gas prices…



Our electricity is even pricier than our gasoline compared with national averages.

I’ve been wondering about this because:

(a) Our electricity relies on cheap renewables and natural gas so it’s not clear why the rates are so high; and

(b) High electricity prices make it harder for us to electrify and hit our emissions goals. Why are we trying to run a race (emissions!) while shooting ourselves in the foot (high prices!)?

To begin to answer this question I looked at this chart from the California Public Utilities Commission’s annual report on electricity and natural gas costs. It shows a breakdown of our electricity rates. You can see that the cost of generating one additional kWh of electricity — the generation cost — is relatively small compared to the rate we pay. Much of the rest comes from transmission and distribution which are largely fixed costs along with a small amount for “public purpose” programs like energy efficiency EV infrastructure and discounts for low-income households. (Remember those heat pump water heater rebates from the last post? We pay for them via our utility bills.)



Electric rate components. Source: CPUC report for the year 2019.

This chart helps to explain why rates from Peninsula Clean Energy and Silicon Valley Clean Energy aren’t as low as you (or they) might hope. They have to pass along most of the PG&E costs as well as a supplementary “franchise” fee. They are able to save you money only on the blue “generation” component. (2) More generally this chart shows that cheap renewables can only do so much for our prices if other costs like distribution and transmission are high. (3)

So are we stuck with high electricity bills? It seems unlikely that distribution and transmission will get much cheaper especially with wildfire and other safety concerns. (4) But some researchers are asking whether these large generally fixed costs belong on our bill to begin with.

Severin Borenstein an economist at UC Berkeley who is an expert on electricity pricing argues that by pricing our electricity using high “average costs” rather than the smaller incremental or “marginal” costs we are causing a number of problems. The higher prices mean that customers are less likely to switch from gas to electricity and wealthier homeowners are more likely to bypass the system with rooftop solar and home batteries. (5)

When electricity is nearly free moving away from gas looks pretty appealing. As the solar households electrify their homes paying neither gas nor electricity bills lower-income households are left holding the bag paying an increasing share of the fixed costs of both utilities.

The pricing incentives are pretty messed up when it comes to equitable electrification.

There is something inherently unfair about incorporating fixed costs into our electricity rates but it may not be obvious. After all it seems like a good way to pay for the poles and wires vegetation management and so on. Indeed it’s pretty common to put fixed costs into product prices. A retail store will incorporate the costs of its buildings into the prices it charges. The price for a gallon of gasoline will include the costs of maintaining the distribution network. In this way everyone pays for those costs in proportion to what they buy. It seems fair right?

Well not so much when it comes to electricity. The problem is that people of all income levels use similar amounts of electricity. (An economist would say that demand for electricity is relatively “inelastic”.) As a result allocating fixed costs based on electricity usage hits lower-income households harder.

Borenstein shares this graph illustrating the concept:



It is less equitable to include fixed costs in electricity rates than it is to include them in gasoline prices or product prices more generally. Source: The Energy Institute Blog 2020

The orange line at the bottom showing what we spend on electricity relative to the lowest-income households is pretty flat. Wealthier people do spend more on electricity but not much more. In contrast wealthier people spend a lot more than lower-income people on gasoline (the green line) and even more on stuff in general (the purple line). Because the orange line is so flat bloating electricity rates with fixed costs disproportionately hurts low-income households even more so than a gas tax or a sales tax. This gets even worse as higher-income households move to solar and stop paying these costs. (The orange line gets flatter and could even slope downwards.)

Borenstein proposes that rather than allocate fixed costs based on electricity usage we allocate them based on income. He outlines a few ways that could be done including tax credits (ala the Earned Income Tax Credit). Borenstein’s blog post on this topic is worth reading as well as this comment (“This is turning electricity supply into a public good on the same order as education and public health.”) and this one (“The problem is not so much rate design as it is the excessive revenue requirements of the California IOUs.”).

What impact would removing fixed costs from our bills have on prices? Borenstein and Bushnell model how rates across the country could evolve if our rates reflected only the incremental cost of adding new power. The map below shows today’s marginal price per kWh. You can see that prices are high here in California as well as in the northeast.



Price per kWh across the US. Source: Borenstein and Bushnell 2019

If states were to remove the fixed costs from their rate structure so that rates better reflected the cost of producing one more kWh the rates might look like this. (This is referred to in the paper as the “private marginal cost”.)



Private marginal cost estimates. Source: Borenstein and Bushnell 2019

California is no longer an outlier!

Borenstein and Bushnell also look at an alternative adjustment. What would happen if electricity rates reflected the costs of pollution emitted by power plants? They might look like this reflecting dirty power in several areas of the country. (The paper refers to this as the “external marginal cost”.)



External marginal cost estimates. Source: Borenstein and Bushnell 2019

If you combine these two changes — removing fixed costs and incorporating pollution impacts — the prices might look like those shown below which the paper refers to as the “social marginal cost”.



Social marginal cost estimates. Source: Borenstein and Bushnell 2019

That is the kind of electricity pricing I could get behind! (My sister in Minnesota maybe not so much.)

The point is prices have consequences and we have options. In California and across the country we should have energy prices that align with our policies. The high electricity prices and underlying rate structure in our state are hurting our ability to fuel switch and hitting low-income households with more of the fixed costs. Moreover the high prices are encouraging homes to move to off-grid power. As generally high-income earners switch to rooftop solar and then electrify their homes greatly reducing their utility bills lower income households end up paying even more. That cannot be the future we seek. Our electricity pricing should be designed to turn us away from fossil fuels both quickly and equitably. We must do better.

Notes and References

1. I use the PG&E price quoted from EIA specifically because the other two prices come from there as well and I wanted the methodology to be consistent. (For example they likely incorporate the CARE rates.)

2. Peninsula Clean Energy has a good description of its rates in the middle of this page including how they compare with PG&E.

3. Palo Alto’s rates are significantly lower than PG&E by about 30%. This is partly because the city has a very inexpensive hydropower contract and partly because it is a municipal utility with other costs independent of PG&E. However even Palo Alto found that its transmission costs went up 15% last year.

4. We should ask why our transmission and distribution costs are so high. My sister’s Minnesota electricity is cheap (11.4 cents/kWh) and her rates include both transmission (1.5 cents) and distribution (4 cents). That is much less than PG&E’s 4 cents and 10 cents respectively. While we could move the costs off of our bill we should also look into reducing them!

5. There is an argument to be made that rooftop solar is not priced properly with power providers paying retail for rooftop solar power that they would otherwise pay wholesale for. I will write about that in a future post. Questions include how to value the added resilience and reduced load on the grid that rooftop solar provides.

6. In case you are wondering our natural gas is also more expensive than the national average but not by as much as electricity.



Price premiums for residential gas and electricity. Gas prices: US CA PG&E. Electricity prices: US and CA PG&E (The local gas price shown here is sourced from PG&E while the others are from EIA. It’s possible they are calculated differently.)

Our natural gas rates have a similar structure to our electricity rates with distribution and public benefits included. According to this CPUC writeup from a few years ago the cost of the gas is about 31% of the rate transportation costs are twice that and the public purpose charge is the remaining 7%. If only the wealthy are able to move away from gas these fixed costs will hit the remaining lower-income gas users that much harder.

It's no wonder the Amalfi Coast is one of the world's most alluring destinations on Earth. What was a collection of humble fishing villages until the 1950s has become an international symbol of glamor the epitome of la dolce vita.

So how do you plan a trip to this glitzy destination without breaking the bank? And which hotels restaurants and experiences are actually worth splurging on? Read on to find out.

Getting There

The closest airport is Naples International Airport (NAP) and from there you can take a ferry train or car to the coast. In 2019 United launched seasonal direct flights from Newark Liberty International (EWR) to Naples International (NAP). Award flights are available from 33000 miles each way. Delta has some award flight availability for upwards of 93000 points round trip but you'll have to make at least one stopover in Rome. Other mileage redemption options include Air Canada's Aeroplan American Airlines AAdvantage and Iberia Avios.

From Naples the absolute best way to get to the coast is by private car transfer but that'll cost you between €100 and €120 ($112 to $135) each way. The cheapest way to get to Sorrento — the gateway to the Amalfi Coast — is to take the Circumvesuviana train but it's also the least comfortable way to go. A good alternative is to take the ferry from the port of Napoli to Sorrento which will cost a much more reasonable €13.20 ($14.83) one way. Renting a car is another option but be aware that the sharply curving narrow coastal roads are not the easiest to navigate — and drivers from this part of Italy are notoriously bad.

Also keep in mind that when you go — and how far in advance you book — will affect the price of flights and hotels. Summer is high season on the Amalfi Coast so you can expect flights and hotels to be most expensive then. Most hotels close for the winter usually from the end of October until Easter. Your best bet for reasonably priced hotels and flights is to go in the spring or fall. According to Skyscanner the best time to book a flight to Italy is 12 weeks out.

Where to Stay

Though the Amalfi Coast is known for having some of Italy's glitziest hotels you can find budget options for less than $50 per night by searching OTAs like Booking.com. Unfortunately points-based hotels are extremely limited. Marriott only has one hotel in Naples and Hilton has just one hotel in Sorrento.

However it might be worth becoming a member of the Leading Hotels of the World's Leaders Club if you want a truly extraordinary stay in this part of the world. Several of the Amalfi Coast's most storied and glamorous hotels — including Le Sirenuse in Positano Palazzo Avino in Ravello Hotel Santa Caterina in Amalfi and the Grand Hotel Excelsior Vittoria in Sorrento — are LHW members.

If your budget allows it you could spend a few nights in an Airbnb or low-cost hotel and then splurge on a night or two at one of those properties which are truly the crème de la crème of the Amalfi Coast. Going during the shoulder season will also help you save on rates at these hotels which can double or triple during the high season.

Where to Eat and Drink

Another way to soak up some of the glamor of the area's most gorgeous hotels without splurging on a room is to stop by for drinks or a meal. At the al fresco Franco's Bar at Le Sirenuse an Aperol Spritz will set you back €12 ($13) — a pittance compared to the nightly room rates which can run you €1632 ($1830) per night.

The Michelin-starred Rossellini's Restaurant at Palazzo Avino is one of the best places on the coast for fine dining. A tasting menu dinner there will cost between €150 and €180 ($168 to $202) which isn't cheap but is a lot less than paying upwards of €770 ($864) for a room. Here waiters donning white jackets glide around the restaurant depositing artful dishes like Mediterranean lobster alla catalana and saffron risotto. If you like fine wines ask the sommelier for a tour of the hotel's wine cellar and he or she will certainly oblige.

Of course there are plenty of moderately priced restaurants like Ristorante Da Costantino in Positano and Kasai in Praiano which serves delicious food in a charmingly rustic environment.

For a quick espresso and a pastry stop by the historic Pasticceria Pansa in Amalfi. And remember if you want to save your hard-earned cash drink your espresso standing up at the bar like the Italians do. Normally an espresso costs €1 to €2 ($1.12 to $2.24) at the bar but the price spikes if you sit and get table service. The same goes if you want to grab a panino at lunchtime. Many bars and cafés offer premade panini that they'll heat up for you to take out or eat at the bar.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5hbHBoYXN0cmVldC5jb20vZWFybmluZ3MtY2FsZW5kYXItZm9yLXRoZS13ZWVrLW9mLWZlYnJ1YXJ5LTEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Earnings calendar for the week of February 1,"In a week that saw one of the worst stock selloffs Gamestop came under spotlight after the stock experienced unprecedented fluctuations marked by a 10-fold spike in value followed by a sharp retreat.

(Jan. 31 2021)—The U.S. Men’s National Team kicked off 2021 with a dominant 7-0 win against Trinidad and Tobago as four players scored and five added assists.

The USA got off to a scorching start and kept up relentless pressure all night as forward Jesus Ferreira helped spark the victory scoring twice while setting up three other goals. Forwards Paul Arriola and Jonathan Lewis also scored twice marking the first time since 1993 that three USMNT players scored multiple goals in a single game. Ferreira and Lewis’ goals were their first for the USA and center back Miles Robinson also netted his first international goal.

A youthful U.S. line-up out possessed the Soca Warriors by a wide margin and piled up a 19-2 advantage in shots. On the night six players earned their first caps: goalkeeper Matt Turner and defender Aaron Herrera started the match while defender George Bello midfielders Andres Perea and Tanner Tessmann and forward Darly Dike came on as second-half substitutes. Ten players who took the field were age-eligible (born in 1997 or later) for March’s Concacaf Men’s Olympic Qualifying Championship.

The USMNT took very little time to show T&T that it would be a long night as Ferreira set up Lewis for his first U.S. goal less than two minutes after the opening whistle.

The Americans pressed aggressively and played at a pace that Trinidad and Tobago struggled to match with the USA spending much of the game in their attacking half. An extended spell of possession deep in the final third sparked the second USA goal in the ninth minute as a nice interchange ended in a nifty Ferreira finish the FC Dallas forward’s first tally of the night.

The USA continued to threaten during the course of the half keeping the Trinidadian defense on its heels and finding plenty of room to run on the wings. Goalkeeper Adrian Foncette had his hands full but did make a few excellent saves on the night to keep the score down. In the 22nd minute Ferreira broke free on the run towards goal and then teed up an onrushing Arriola for the veteran winger’s first of the night. Not letting up the D.C. United forward bagged his brace in the 41st. Arriola has scored three goals in his last two matches and tonight’s were his seventh and eight for the USA.

After the break midfielder Andres Perea entered the match as a substitute to earn his first cap. The Orlando City SC midfielder was granted a one-time change of association from Colombia to represent the USA just before the USMNT’s January training camp kicked off.

The USA kept its foot on the gas after the break and a flurry of goals extended the American advantage early in the second half. A clinical set piece opened the scoring as captain Aaron Long headed the service back across goal to his center back partner Robinson who buried a diving header from close range for his first international tally. After opening the scoring early Lewis also netted in 55th minute ripping a rocket from 18 yards into the right side of the net. Ferreira added his second to cap the scoring in the 62nd.

Following the three-goal outburst Berhalter made four changes around the 65th minute mark. Shortly after the mass substitution Trinidad and Tobago was awarded a penalty kick and Turner had his biggest moment of the night. After not having much work in the opening hour the debutant goalkeeper dove to his right to make the stop on Alvin Jones’ shot then pounced on the rebound to avoid any further danger.

It was the first penalty kick saved by a USMNT goalkeeper since Brad Guzan's stop Asamoah Gyan’s spot kick in the USA's 2-1 friendly win against Ghana on July 1 2017 in East Hartford Conn.

The USMNT will return to action during the March international window. The U-23 USMNT will compete at the Concacaf Men’s Olympic Qualifying Championship from March 18-30 in Guadalajara Mexico.





GOAL SCORING RUNDOWN



USA – Jonathan Lewis (Jesus Ferreira) 2nd minute: The USMNT got on the board early as Ferreira ran onto a pass into the left side of the penalty area beating onrushing Trinidad goalkeeper Adrian Foncette to the ball and then touched it away from him. As Foncette tried to recover back into the goal mouth Ferreira spun to face the middle of the field and calmly rolled a pass into the path of Lewis who one-timed it to the left side of the net. USA 1 TRI 0

USA – Jesus Ferreira (Sam Vines) 9th minute: Trinidad & Tobago had trouble clearing their defensive third and midfielder Kellyn Acosta poked the ball away from a Soca Warrior to maintain possession.

Vines made an overlapping run deep into the left side of the penalty area and Lewis played him a perfectly weighted pass. Vines then drove to the end line and cut back a cross to Ferreira who was lurking near inside the six-yard box and he volleyed it home just inside the left post first U.S. goal. USA 2 TRI 0

USA – Paul Arriola (Jesus Ferreira) 22nd minute: Breaking free down the right wing Ferreira raced into the Trinidad penalty area maneuvering around one defender before patiently laying a short pass off for the late-arriving Arriola. The charging winger launched a hard-hit shot past the Foncette inside the left post for his seventh international goal. USA 3 TRI 0

USA – Paul Arriola (Jesus Ferreira) 41st minute: As Trinidad attempted to clear a ball in the air an errant header went right to Ferreira who put Arriola on towards goal with a strong header of his own.

USA 4 TRI 0

USA – Miles Robinson (Aaron Long) 52nd minute: On a night with limited set-piece opportunities the USA executed superbly to open the second-half scoring. From the right side of the field Kellyn Acosta swung in a ball to the far side of the six-yard box where Long stood unmarked. He headed it across the goalmouth to Robinson and his diving header from close range was good for his first international goal. USA 5 TRI 0.

USA – Jonathan Lewis (Kellyn Acosta) 55th minute: From just behind the midfield line Acosta bombed a ball downfield to Lewis streaking down the left wing. The Colorado Rapids forward dribbled to the 18-yard line before launching a shot between two defenders to the far top corner. USA 6 TRI 0



USA – Jesus Ferreira (Paul Arriola) 62nd minute: Another booming pass teed up the USA’s final goal of the evening. From near the half-line Jackson Yueill sent a weakside pass to Arriola on the right wing. He centered it for Ferreira near the top of the box and he dribbled towards the penalty spot before sending a hard-hit shot into the back of the net. USA 7 TRI 0

ORLANDO Fla. (AP) — Jesús Ferreira gained U.S. citizenship on Dec. 16 2019 and made his debut for the American national team last Feb. 1. Then he struggled through his second season with Dallas with one goal in 19 Major League Soccer matches.

“Obviously kind of upset” he said. “I took it as you have to do better. You have to make sure that 2021 is a way better year than the past two years.”

Ferrieira scored his first two international goals and had three assists leading the United States over a rusty Trinidad and Tobago 7-0 in an exhibition on Sunday night.

Paul Arriola and Jonathan Lewis scored twice each for a U.S. roster missing its Europe-based players.

Coming off a 6-2 win over Panama in November with top American players and a 6-0 rout of El Salvador last month with a group mostly from MLS the U.S. outshot the Soca Warriors 19-2 and scored five goals for a third straight game for the first time. The last time three Americans scored two goals in a game was an 8-1 rout of the Cayman Islands in a 1993 friendly led by Joe-Max Moore Dominic Kinnear and Mark Chung.

“It wasn’t a World Cup qualifying-caliber team based on who they had available” U.S. coach Gregg Berhalter said of Trinidad and Tobago “but nonetheless it was good to see the focus.”

Ferreira was born in Santa Marta Colombia and grew up in Barranquilla the son of David Ferreira a midfielder who scored three goals in 39 international appearances for Colombia. He moved to Texas when his dad played for Dallas in MLS from 2009-13 and the family remained there even when his father switched clubs starting in 2014. He played in the Dallas academy made a brief pro debut in 2017 and spent 2018 on loan with the Tulsa Roughnecks of the second-tier United Soccer League.

Berhalter used the 20-year-old Ferreira as a center forward who can drop back into the midfield.

“When you have wingers that can threaten the back line you can afford to drop a striker in because you still get that verticality” Berhalter said. “What we talked to him about today was arriving in the penalty box and he certainly did that. So to me it was a complete performance.”

Lewis scored his first and second international goals and Miles Robinson got his first.

Arriola who last month made his first start since tearing his right ACL on Feb. 15 scored twice as the U.S. took a 4-0 halftime lead to give him three goals in his last two international matches. Arriola and Sebastian Lletget were the players on the field most likely to see significant time with the full group.

Goalkeeper Matt Turner and right back Aaron Herrera started in their debuts as the U.S. went again without Europe-based players and 20-year-old midfielder Andrés Perea entered at the start of the second half in his debut then conceded a penalty kick with a high boot to Ryan Telfer in the 65th minute.

Perea who plays for Orlando started for Colombia at the 2017 Under-17 World Cup and 2019 Under-20 World Cup.

Turner 26 leapt to his right to stop Alvin Jones’ penalty kick.

“A late bloomer” Berhalter said. “Really performs well in the league gets his opportunity with the national team debuts saves a penalty to keep to maintain the shutout? It’s a storybook a storybook type of saga.”

George Bello debuted in the 64th Daryl Dike in the 65th and Tanner Tessmann in the 78th. There have been 63 debuts since the October 2017 loss at Trinidad that prevented the Americans from reaching the 2018 World Cup including 40 in 23 matches since Berhalter became coach.

The 22nd-ranked Americans played just four matches in 2020 their fewest since 1987 but figure to have a far busier 2021. Two friendlies in Europe are likely in March the U.S. meets Honduras in June in a semifinal of the first CONCACAF Nations League and the Americans travel to Trinidad in early September for the start of World Cup qualifying delayed by the novel coronavirus pandemic.

Among starters Ferreira Lewis Robinson Vines Herrera and Yueill are eligible for Olympic qualifiers in March limited to players born on or after Jan. 1 1997.

“The earlier we can get our hands on them the earlier we can work with them and I think the better off this whole program will be in the future” Berhalter said.

Lewis put the U.S. ahead 1:40 in off a pass from Ferreira and Ferreira doubled the lead in the ninth minute with a left-footed volley from 6 yards. Arriola scored in the 22nd with a 12-yard right-footed shot and in the 41st with his left foot from just outside the penalty area.

Robinson made it 5-0 in the 52nd with a short-range diving header Lewis got his second goal from 18 yards in the 55th and Ferreira scored again in the 62nd with a right foot shot from near the penalty spot.

No. 103 Trinidad played for the first time under coach Terry Fenwick a defender from England’s 1986 World Cup squad and for the first time since November 2019.

As the government reform group Public Citizen tweeted “If you’re spending $740000000000 annually on ‘defense’ but fascists dressed for the renaissance fair can still storm the Capitol as they please maybe it’s time to rethink national security?”

At a time of acute concern about the health of our democracy any such rethinking must among other things focus on strengthening the authority of civilians and civilian institutions over the military in an American world where almost the only subject the two parties in Congress can agree on is putting up ever more money for the Pentagon. This means so many in our political system need to wean themselves from the counterproductive habit of reflexively seeking out military or retired military voices to validate them on issues ranging from public health to border security that should be quite outside the military’s purview.

It’s certainly one of the stranger phenomena of our era: after 20 years of endless war in which trillions of dollars were spent and hundreds of thousands died on all sides without the U.S. military achieving anything approaching victory the Pentagon continues to be funded at staggering levels while funding to deal with the greatest threats to our safety and “national security” — from the pandemic to climate change to white supremacy — proves woefully inadequate. In good times and bad the U.S. military and the “industrial complex” that surrounds it which President Dwight D. Eisenhower first warned us about in 1961 continue to maintain a central role in Washington even though they’re remarkably irrelevant to the biggest challenges facing our democracy.

These days it’s completely normal for military and defense officials to weigh in endlessly on what once would have been civilian matters. As the Biden years begin it’s time to give some serious thought to how to demilitarize our democracy.

Unfortunately in the America of 2021 the short-term benefit of relying on the widely accepted credibility of military figures to promote policies of every sort is obvious indeed. Who in the political class in the nation’s capital wouldn’t want a stamp of approval from dozens of generals active or retired endorsing their favorite initiative or candidate? (It’s something in years past the authors of this piece have been guilty of as well.) As it happens though such approval comes at a high price undermining as it does the authority of civilian officials and agencies while skewing resources toward the Pentagon that should be invested elsewhere to keep us truly safe.

It’s an essential attribute of the American system that the military remains under civilian authority. These days however given the number of current or retired military officers who have become key arbiters of what we should do on a dizzying array of critical issues civilian control is the policy equivalent of an endangered species.

In the last election season long before the attack on the Capitol there was already an intense national discussion about how to prevent violence at the polls a conversation that all too quickly (and disturbingly) focused on what role the military should play in the process. General Mark Milley chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was repeatedly asked to provide assurances that it would have no role in determining the outcome of the election something that in another America would have been a given.

Meanwhile some actually sought more military involvement. For example in a widely debated “open letter” to Milley retired Army officers John Nagl and Paul Yingling stated that “if Donald Trump refuses to leave office at the expiration of his constitutional term the United States military must remove him by force and you must give that order.” Proposals of this sort undermine the integrity of the many laws Congress and the states have put in place to prevent the military or armed vigilantes from playing any role in the electoral process.

Similarly both former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden have identified the military as a key future player in distributing the Covid-19 vaccine something that could and should be handled by public-health institutions if only they like the Pentagon had adequate resources.

The military knows best?

During and after the attack on the Capitol officials from the military and national security worlds were given pride of place in discussions about the future of our democracy. Their opinions were sought out by the media and others on a wide range of issues that fell well outside their primary areas of expertise. A letter from 10 former secretaries of defense calling on the Republican caucus to respect the results of the election was given headline attention while political figures pressed to have retired military officers involved in the January 6th assault tried in military not civilian courts.

Before pursuing the second impeachment of Donald Trump House Speaker Nancy Pelosi typically turned to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs (who isn’t even in the civilian chain of command) to seek assurance that he could stop the president from starting a last-minute nuclear war. And none of this was faintly unusual given that retired military officers have regularly been asked to weigh in on subjects as varied as abortion rights climate change and childhood obesity. It’s not of course that such figures shouldn’t be able like anyone else to offer their opinions or support on matters of public health and safety but that their voices shouldn’t matter more than those of public-health experts scientists medical professionals or other civilians.

Despite its failure to win a war in decades the military remains one of America’s most respected institutions getting the kind of appreciation that generally doesn’t extend to other more successful public servants. After almost 20 years of forever wars it’s hard at this point to accept that the military’s reputation for wisdom is deserved. In fact continually relying on retired generals and other present or former national security officials as validators effectively erodes the credibility of and the public’s trust in other institutions that are meant to keep us healthy and safe.

In the Covid-19 moment it should be clear that relying on narrowly defined notions of national security harms our democracy a subject that none of those military or former military figures are likely to deal with. In addition in all too many cases current and retired military officials have abused the public trust in ways that call into question their right to serve as judges of what’s important or even to imagine that they could provide objective advice. For one thing a striking number of high-ranking officers on leaving the military pass through the infamous revolving door of the military-industrial complex into positions as executives lobbyists board members or consultants for the defense industry. They work on behalf of firms like Raytheon Lockheed Martin Boeing and General Dynamics that receive a combined $100 billion annually in Pentagon contracts with little accountability even as they remain key go-to media figures.

They then use their former rank and the prestige attached to it to lobby Congress and influence the media on the need for endless wars and an ever-increasing military budget to support major weapons programs like Lockheed Martin’s troubled F-35 Joint Strike Fighter — all without bothering to disclose that they stand to gain financially from the positions they’re taking. And the prospect of a big fat salary in the weapons sector upon retirement also exerts an unhealthy influence on officers still serving in the military who are often loath to anger or in any way alienate their potential future employers.

This revolving-door phenomenon is widespread. A study by the Project on Government Oversight found that in 2018 alone there were 645 cases in which the top 20 defense contractors hired former government officials military officers members of Congress and senior congressional legislative staff as lobbyists board members or executives. This should hardly inspire public trust in their opinions.

In some cases ex-military officers have even taken to the airwaves and the op-ed pages of newspapers to advocate for war without disclosing their ties to the arms industry. A 2008 New York Times investigation for example revealed that a number of retired-officers-turned-media pundits with continuing defense industry ties had for years advocated for the Iraq War at the Pentagon’s behest. Ex-generals like former Trump administration Defense Secretary James Mattis who served on the board of General Dynamics before taking the helm of the Pentagon and returned there shortly after stepping down too often use their stature to refrain from providing basic information to the media while befogging the transparency and accountability that should be a pillar of democracy.

The politicization of the military

When civilian voices and policies are eclipsed as the central determinants in how our democracy should operate a larger dilemma arises: continuing to rely on the military as a primary source of judgment for what’s right or wrong in the civilian world risks politicizing the armed forces too. From retired Lieutenant General Michael Flynn leading chants of “Lock her up!” at the 2016 Republican National Convention to the competition between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump as well as in the 2020 election campaign between Joe Biden and Donald Trump to see who could get more retired generals to endorse him or her only helps militarize the civilian election process and politicizes what should be a nonpartisan institution.

Given the more than a trillion dollars Americans annually invest in the national security state it’s striking to note for instance how such institutions let us down when it came to addressing the threats of white nationalism. Last summer the Intercept uncovered a buried FBI report on the shortcomings of various federal agencies when it came to dealing with domestic terrorism. Before the 2020 election the bureau refused to release that report on the domestic threat of white supremacy. Last year in a similar fashion the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) withheld for months its assessment of the same “lethal” threat of racist extremism in this country.

While there must be a full investigation of what happened at the Capitol on January 6th reports seem to indicate a striking blindness in the national security state to the possibility of such an attack. It’s not that the DHS the FBI or the military need an influx of new funds to face the problem. Rather what’s needed at this moment in history is a clearer focus on the real risks to our country which have little to do with foreign terrorists the Taliban or other such groups the U.S. has been fighting abroad for years on end. The Department of Defense typically did itself and the rest of us no favors by burying a report on widespread racism in the ranks of the military which though completed in 2017 didn’t see the light of day until this January. Only in the aftermath of the riot at the Capitol did that organization finally begin to truly address its own white-supremacy problems.

The military like so many other American institutions has failed to reckon seriously with deep-seated racism in its ranks. Even before the January 6th insurrection it was clear that such racism made it nearly impossible for Black officers to be promoted. And while many questioned the naming of key military bases after Confederate generals the issue has only recently been addressed (over a presidential veto at that) with the creation of a new commission to rename them. Reports of active duty reserve and veteran members of the military aiding the Capitol insurrection only bring into stark relief the inexcusable costs of not having addressed the problem earlier.

More Pentagon spending won’t make us safer

There are also high costs to be paid for relying on the Department of Defense to handle problems that have nothing to do with its primary mission. Using the armed forces as key players in addressing crises that aren’t military in nature only further undermines civilian institutions and is often counterproductive as well.

In the initial stages of the Covid-19 pandemic a number of politicians called for President Trump to use the Defense Production Act (as it seems Biden will indeed soon do) and the Department of Defense to ramp up the production of N95 masks ventilators and other personal protective equipment. The story of what happened to such funds in the Trump years should be telling. The Washington Post discovered that $1 billion in supposed pandemic relief money was instead funneled directly to defense contractors and $70 million of the funds the Pentagon spent went to ventilators that proved unfit for Covid-19 patients. While some of that money did go to bolster mask supply chains another Post investigation discovered that such efforts did not come close to addressing national shortfalls and amounted to less than the department spends on instruments uniforms and travel for military bands.

Perhaps the most disturbing cost of our overreliance on the military can be found in Congress’s budget and policy priorities. In December of last year a bill to authorize nearly $740 billion in Pentagon spending garnered enough votes to easily overcome President Trump’s veto (motivated mainly by his refusal to condone renaming military bases named after Confederate generals) at the very moment when Congress was blocking legislation to give $2000 relief checks directly to Covid-19 embattled Americans.

By now two decades into the twenty-first century it’s clear that more money for the Pentagon hasn’t made this country safer. It has however helped give the military an ever more central role in our previously civilian political world. Biden’s selection of retired General Lloyd Austin III to be secretary of defense only emphasizes this point. While it’s certainly laudatory to appoint the first Black leader to that position Austin has retired so recently that he needed a congressional waiver from a law requiring a seven-year cooling off period before taking up such a civilian post (just as Mattis did four years ago) — another sign that civilian control of the military is continuing to weaken. In addition now that he has retired from his role in private industry Austin stands to make a small fortune up to $1.7 million when he divests his stock holdings in Raytheon Technologies.

“In the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military-industrial complex” President Eisenhower warned Americans in his 1961 farewell address. How right he proved to be! Sixty years later it’s become all too clear that more must be done to deal with that very “unwarranted influence.” The immediate crises of the American republic should be clear enough right now: responding to the pandemic and restoring our civilian democracy. Certainly military leaders like Milley should be appreciated for agreeing on the need to prioritize the pandemic and oppose sedition. However more Pentagon spending and more military influence will not in the end make us any safer.

Egg Harbor City will be the first municipality to consider making that move without having to convince residents to vote for it in a referendum.

Two-thirds of the nine-member Common Council will have to agree to the sale.

The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection agreed with city officials that it does not have the money to replace its aging water and sewer system.

A special council meeting was held Wednesday via Zoom to discuss the agreement of sale with New Jersey American Water for the city’s water treatment plant. The council did not specify when a vote on the proposal will take place.

A good portion of the city’s system is more than 100 years old said Ryan McGowan the city engineer.

New Jersey American Water has agreed to pay the city $21.8 million for its water system which is the highest purchase price ever in the state McGowan said.

The system needs $38 million worth of improvements during the next 20 years and of that amount $14 million worth are essential upgrades McGowan said.

Three different companies expressed interest in taking over the city’s water system but New Jersey American Water was determined to be the best fit.

“It’s a very good deal for the city” McGowan said. “We have been negotiating on the agreement for a couple of months.”

New Jersey American Water can offer short- and long-term rate stability said Nicholas DeVecchis the senior manager of business development. The company has a low-income customer financial assistance program for those who qualify he said.

David Forcinito the senior director of operations said the company’s service area includes Galloway Township and it already has an operating center in Egg Harbor Township.

“We would interview and consider any employees working for the city’s water and sewer departments” Forcinito said.

New Jersey American Water estimates that it can deliver water and sewer service to city residents less expensively than the municipality can and DeVecchis said he believes the Common Council will be voting in the next month or so.

Mayor Lisa Jiampetti said New Jersey American Water wants to be partner with the municipality as opposed to coming in and dictating terms.

“I’m looking forward to being a partner with American Water” said Jiampetti who will have the tie-breaking vote if there is a Common Council tie.

A look at the history of the unique war memorial built through military-citizen cooperation and what new additions have been made to this landmark of Pune.

The history of war memorial in Pune

The National War Memorial in Pune which is an unmissable landmark that stands at the Morwada junction in Camp is arguably the only war memorial in the country that has been constructed through citizens’ contributions. The memorial depicts the names of post-independence martyrs from the Army Navy and Air Force hailing from Maharashtra inscribed on marble.

The citizens’ initiative in constructing a post-independence war memorial in Pune has its origins in the December 1996 celebration of the silver jubilee of India’s victory over Pakistan in 1971 leading to the birth of Bangladesh. Hosted by a Joint Committee led by The Indian Express and comprising citizens of Pune the celebrations of the silver jubilee were also one of its kind in the country at the time.

The committee of citizens formed by the Express Group passed a resolution in January 1997 without waiting for a push from the government that the citizens would construct a war memorial in Pune as a mark of their gratitude for the guardians of the land sea and air frontiers.

The committee which was chaired by Brigadier NB Grant (Retd) approached the Headquarters Southern Command for a suitable piece of land which was immediately earmarked by the Cantonment Board. The committee functioned as a catalyst for fund-raising. A Military Engineers Services contractor under the supervision of the Chief Engineer Pune Zone and Headquarters Pune Sub Area carried out the construction.

Work began on August 15 1997 and exactly one year later the then Governor of Maharashtra Dr P C Alexander dedicated the memorial to the nation. The memorial has an 18-metre-high obelisk signifying ‘Blessings from Heaven’ dressed in cherry brown granite with marble panels carrying names of the martyrs on three sides.

Names of 1480 officers junior commissioned officers and other ranks hailing from Maharashtra who laid down their lives in action since independence till date have been inscribed on the marble panels.

Additions to the war memorial premises

In 2008 the war memorial underwent a major renovation to include the construction of compound wall and gate pathways display of a Vijayanta Tank a MiG-23 aircraft scaled model of Indian Navy’s guided-missile Frigate INS Trishul and improving the landscape with stone-engraved galleries providing an account of major battles in the Southern Command theatre. It was around this time that the memorial was rechristened as National War Memorial Southern Command.

During the Vijay Diwas celebration in 2011 a 101- foot-tall flag mast was inaugurated on the premises.

In 2015 a war museum was opened comprising paintings murals artefacts and photos depicting Southern Command’s martial history post-independence operations along with humanitarian aid and disaster relief operations along with a display of real tanks – some of them captured from the enemy forces during past operations.

The museum depicts the highlights such as operations at the time of the mergers of Goa Junagarh and Hyderabad into the Union of India the 1965 war the 1971 war and the 1987 International Peacekeeping Forces’ mission to Sri Lanka. Later an evening light-and-sound show was also included in the daily routine of the war museum.

The latest renovation

Initially due to the COVID-19 restrictions and later due to renovation work the war memorial and the museum remained closed for several months. In its renovated avatar eight Pillars of Valour depicting major operations by the Indian Armed Forces since Independence four murals depicting the bravery and valour in various battles and busts of Param Vir Chakra awardees have been added to the National War Memorial.

In addition replacement of tiling widening of pathways and lighting along the perimeter was also carried out as part of the renovation.

“The complete initiative was envisioned by the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief Southern Command and has been wholeheartedly supported by the Pune Municipal Corporation and Amphenol Interconnect India Pvt Ltd who generously contributed towards the renovation in the true spirit of civil-military co-operation. The renovated National War Memorial and the light-and-sound show will be open for all visitors in accordance with Covid-19 protocols three days a week on Friday Saturday and Sunday” a Southern Command statement said. The light-and-sound show will be held at 6.45 pm on three days of the week.

Screens have become an integral feature of daily life facilitating how we work connect with loved ones shop order food and find entertainment.

While various lockdowns and states of emergency have become the “new normal” around the world we have all retreated into our digital devices. Perhaps too eagerly: Numerous empirical studies have recorded a growing trend of screen time during COVID-19 — and the Apple Screen Time function has left many shocked at the amount of time they have racked up on their devices. The hours spent bingeing TV series doomscrolling election-watching Zooming friends and family and watching endless TikTok videos add up.

Surely all of that screen time can’t be good for us. Studies show that heavy use of electronic devices before bed suppresses melatonin production a hormone that helps balance the sleep cycle and negatively impacts our sleeping patterns. A separate study conducted at the University of Pennsylvania provides evidence that using social media can also increase depression anxiety and loneliness.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNndWlkZS5jb20vZmVhdHVyZXMvd2h5LWktc3RpbGwtd29udC1kaXRjaC1teS0xMS15ZWFyLW9sZC10dtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why I still won't ditch my 11-year-old TV,"It’s been nearly four and a half years since I purchased a new TV. It was a time when prices had started falling and the Black Friday discounts meant I could pick up a 40-inch screen with 4K and HDR for $100 less than my then-current TV had cost me six years earlier.

Normally in those situations you’d get rid of the old model and revel in the improvements your new screen has to offer. I had 4K and HDR now with upscaling to boot so the older bulkier screen is basically obsolete.

Except I never did. The 30-pound 32-inch Full HD TV I picked up at Costco back in 2010 never left my side.

These days it’s not uncommon to swap out our older devices for the latest and shiniest model. It may have plenty of life left in it but we’re told new equals better and that’s the way it should be. That doesn’t stop it from being wasteful and when faced with the prospect of getting rid of my old TV I just thought “well there’s nothing wrong with it so why not keep it?”

There are plenty of things that have gone wrong with that TV over the years so maybe that statement isn’t entirely true. There’s been a prominent dead pixel on the left side of the screen for the better part of a decade now and the USB port doesn’t read data anymore. It also predates the affordable smart TV so you need a streaming device if you want binge Netflix or Amazon.

Crucially if I want to watch movies and play video games the 11-year-old TV works just as well as the day I bought it. I could have taken the set to the local recycling center donated it to charity or even given it away to a random person but I just didn’t see the point. Certainly not when I could still put the aging TV to good use.

Old doesn't mean useless

I’m not a hoarder and I didn’t keep the screen so it could take up space and gather dust; my solution was to put it in my bedroom. That way I can watch TV in bed whenever the feeling arises. After all there’s nothing more comfortable as your own bed. It really didn’t matter than I was living in a one-bedroom apartment at the time and both screens were less than 5 seconds away from each other.

I’ve moved twice since then once to an even smaller (and cheaper) place and then again to an actual house with more than one floor. I still have both TVs and the now-11-year-old-box is still in my bedroom and still gets plenty of use.

In fact before I redecorated it my old set was the only TV getting any use on account of its bulk making it a lot more stable on the limited furniture I had.

I can’t say I’ve never faltered in my loyalty to the old screen however. I am a practical person and there are reasons why you might not want a heavy aged TV lying around. It’s pretty big for starters and the frame around the screen means it's much bigger than a replacement 32-inch TV would be.

Hell it’s bigger than the new TV that took its place in my living room. Seriously over the past ten years we’ve seen the much-needed death of the bezel and there’s no better way to visualize that than looking at my TVs side-by-side.

But hey the thickness of the thing also means I can adorn it with random nerdy stuff. That already makes it more interesting to look at than a newer TV no matter how advanced in years it may be.

The legacy ports I need

But even then as long as the TV works I have no plans to get rid of it. I definitely wouldn’t be opposed to having a third screen in my office or maybe I could keep it in reserve for tinkering with older tech. Because there’s still plenty of stuff that isn’t immediately compatible with modern TVs.

I discovered this first-hand when dusting off my old PS2 and realizing I couldn’t remember how it was supposed to plug into the new TV. Trying to get everything sorted meant figuring out where the problem was and whether it was the adaptor the cable or something else entirely. Thankfully Grandpa TV came to the rescue with its composite ports confirming that the PS2’s video cable was working just fine.

This TV was purchased in that awkward time when HDMI was taking over but still hadn’t quite succeeded. So it has laughably obsolete ports. S-Video multiple SCART ports and so on. It also has four HDMI ports which gives it a tiny advantage over the three on my new TV. Basically it’ll connect to everything released between now and the early ‘90s. I could probably plug in a laser disc player if I really felt like it.

It just doesn’t have 4K HDR or the ability to safely hang on my cracker-thin walls. But nothing is perfect.

It's functional but it's not perfect

I’ve never had an issue with the size though just the weight. Thirty pounds isn’t a lot to carry but it does make life difficult when you’re trying to mount the thing on a wall. More so when you the wall in question is made of pretty thin plasterboard that doesn’t really handle weight too well.

While I was able to mount the venerable TV it was always a very precarious fix and I didn’t fancy risking it and being startled awake at 3 a.m. when gravity finally won the battle. There are better ways to get around the limitation but I didn’t see much point. Especially since it would have involved more drilling and potentially more patching should the attempt fail.

The way my bedroom is laid out that wall opposite the bed is the most optimal place for the TV to live. Not only is it the best viewing angle it’s also the only spot in the room with two power sockets. Sadly limited floor space makes it next to impossible to just use a TV stand or some other piece of furniture.

That was the point I briefly considered getting a real replacement: a cheap TV that was light enough to safely mount on the wall and comfortably watch in bed. But this all happened in mid-January and the Black Friday/holiday sales season was truly over. Faced with the prospect of paying full price to replace a TV that didn’t really need replacing or having to lie on my side if I want to watch Netflix on a big screen in bed I chose the latter.

That’s not to say I’ll never consider giving up my aging TV unless it breaks down. I wouldn’t mind having a wall-mounted TV in my room but at the moment my money is better spent on other things. Like food bills or a PS5. But if the right deal comes along? I am certainly open to picking up a new screen.",,,,,,,,,

It’s impossible to ignore the great risks taken by firefighters. They experience injuries in large numbers and there is significant loss of life. Almost half of this loss of life is due to cardiovascular events. Additionally studies suggest that there is an increased risk of the development of certain cancers.

These brave men and women put their lives on the line to rescue and protect others. They won’t hesitate to run into a burning building while wearing heavy gear and carrying heavy equipment in order to save lives.

“​​Their job requires a combination of performance mobility strength and endurance and it often exposes them to environmental hazards and psychosocial hazards as well” said Dr. Latha Brubaker senior vice president of medical operations at Concentra.

“Being a firefighter can be physically difficult it can be dangerous and the impact of fighting fires and rescue can have a behavioral health impact as well.”

Given the physical and emotional challenges associated with their jobs firefighters need to be in top physical condition. Regular holistic health screenings and preventive conditioning programs can help protect these heroes ensuring they have long careers serving their communities.

A Dangerous Job

To understand the physical and mental health threats firefighters face it’s important to examine how firefighting exposes them to a number of different risks. Their job is physically taxing. They must wear heavy gear to protect them from high-temperature exposure while rescuing people and pets. They have to climb ladders and stairs during rescue operations. Although wearing masks to limit these exposures firefighters can inhale smoke and be exposed to harmful chemicals and environmental toxins increasing their risk of certain cancers.

“Firefighters have to climb ladders and stairs all the while hauling very heavy and unruly fire hoses and wearing very heavy equipment and PPE” Brubaker said.

While completing these physically demanding tasks firefighters can inhale smoke and other environmental toxins increasing their risks of certain cancers. A study of 30000 firefighters spanning from 1950 to 2009 found that firefighters were 9% more likely to be diagnosed with cancer and 14% more likely to die from the disease than the general population.

Outside of the physically taxing elements firefighters often work in distressing circumstances. There may be thoughts of the personal risks taken to save others. They witness significant injuries and loss of life.

All of these situations have the potential to be emotionally distressing for firefighters. That’s why a number of states — including California Tennessee Florida and Georgia — have passed or are considering passing laws that include PTSD benefits under workers’ comp coverage for firefighters.

“We’ve really doubled down on our commitment to behavioral health and we’ve gone so far as to partner with some third-party resources that have expanded our ability to provide behavioral health support” said Chris Studebaker senior director of onsite preventive services at Concentra.

Protecting Firefighter Health

Unlike in other professions it’s hard to reduce the number of physical and environmental hazards a firefighter faces on the job. Yes PPE can go a long way in protecting firefighters from burns and other injuries but the physical demands are also extreme. Firefighters are wrangling heavy fire hoses to stop the damage. In addition they are often lifting people and maneuvering in confined or challenging spaces.

In order to make sure firefighters are up to the task many departments conduct annual physical health assessments so that they can be certain their firefighters are physically and mentally prepared for the job. Medical personnel follow the guidelines provided by the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Standard 1582 on Comprehensive Occupational Medicine Programs for Fire Departments which helps them determine if there is a condition present that may prevent a firefighter from performing their essential job functions.

The Joint Labor Management Wellness-Fitness Initiative comprised of two major fire service organizations worked to develop a comprehensive wellness-fitness program. Based on this initiative NFPA developed standards regulating these programs. This resulted in the suggestion of adding cancer screening fitness assessments and behavioral health screening to the periodic health assessments of firefighters.

“Some fire departments are now asking us to perform cancer screening” Brubaker said. “Cancer screening recommendations are made by the US Preventive Services Task Force for example and are based on a systematic review of scientific evidence published in peer-reviewed journals. When determining the appropriate screening tests it is important to review the USPSTF recommendations with the understanding of the potential additional risks amongst firefighters for certain cancers.

Sleep health is another area of issue in the fire service due to the 24 or 48-hour shift schedule and the mental strain and stress of the job.

Beyond screenings firehouses can opt to partner with providers of on-site health services including physical therapists who can work collaboratively with employers to develop and implement injury-prevention programs. Known as “tactical athlete programs” because their rigor is like that of the training a pro athlete would undergo these solutions can help catch injuries before they become severe and help keep firefighters’ bodies functioning optimally to enable them to perform their job.

Wearable technologies too are likely to play a role in keeping firefighters safe in the future: “We’re seeing the use of wearable tech sensors that look at environmental exposures and heat. And now the technologies can even track their sleep health” Studebaker said. “I think the future of wearable tech is going to shift away from discrete individual devices and more towards garment-based sensors.”

A Trusted Partner for Firefighter Physicals

The physical rigor required to fight fires combined with the emotional stressors present in the job mean that employers need to put extra care into guarding firefighters’ health and safety. Firefighters should undergo regular physical exams and Concentra is just the partner they need to conduct these physicals.

Concentra clinicians perform examinations imaging and lab tests that meet the National Fire Protection Association standards.

Firefighters who undergo these examinations will complete a physical fitness test that assesses their lifting pushing pulling carrying climbing and other abilities. These kinds of assessments can guard against musculoskeletal injuries common in the industry.

Should an injury occur the clinician utilizes a conservative treatment approach with an emphasis on active rehabilitation. Since firefighters are in safety sensitive positions opioids are usually avoided.

“​​Musculoskeletal injuries can be managed without the use of opioids” Brubaker said. “Our approach is a conservative one with the use of physical therapy when appropriate and anti-inflammatory medication if needed. We try to avoid prescribing opioids. Opioids are typically unnecessary.”

A Concentra clinician will perform lab tests including a complete blood count comprehensive metabolic panel lipid panel and urinalysis as well as TB tests. They will do alcohol and drug tests. They will perform audiograms pulmonary function tests chest X-rays and EKGs. They will complete a cardiovascular risk assessment and depending on age and the level of risks a stress test will be performed either at the onsite clinic or a cardiology office.

“It’s important for us to make sure in the first place that they’re healthy from a cardiovascular perspective that they’re healthy from a respiratory perspective” Studebaker said.

Behavioral health screening and cancer screening can be performed at Concentra Onsite Health clinics. Clinicians can conduct screenings for six cancers firefighters are at elevated risk for: colorectal prostate skin blood thyroid and bladder.

Concentra Onsite Health clinicians assess firefighters’ health holistically — something that is essential for a job that is both physically and emotionally taxing. By providing whole-person care Concentra Onsite Health aims to guard firefighters’ health so that they can come home to their families after a day of protecting others.

“Most firefighters are very passionate about the work they do. They are vital members of their community and take risks every day to keep these communities safe. The work of a firefighter can have an adverse impact on their long-term health and well-being. It is equally vital that we take care of our firefighters and do what we can to improve their overall health.”

Amad Diallo scored only 13 minutes into his first appearance for Manchester United robbing the ball off Billy Koumetio and duly finishing past Marcelo to put his side in front. Joe Hugill doubled United’s lead with a similarly composed one-on-one finish assisted by Arnau Puigmal. Hugill now has 11 goals in 18 appearances in all competitions.

Errors at the back allowed Liverpool to score twice before half-time the goals coming from Tyler Morton and Louis Longstaff.

Joe Hugill ran the show in the second half with the assistance of an excellent Hannibal Mejbri. 17-year-old Hugill ended up with four goals. Amad Diallo got two himself.

17 years old Joe Hugill signed for Manchester United last summer. He has quickly established himself as the first-choice striker for the under-23s partly in thanks to an injury to D’Mani Mellor but also thanks to performances of serious quality.

A hat-trick against Liverpool while playing an age group up is a statement from Hugill. His first goal was a composed left-footed finish. The finish was good but it was the run that was perfectly timed to allow Puigmal to feed him through on goal.

The second goal was a different kind of movement not running on the shoulder of the defender but instead moving within the penalty area to stay unmarked. Fernandez pulled the ball back and Hugill opened his body up and finished high above the legs of the Liverpool defenders. The third was a well-taken penalty into the bottom left corner. The fourth was another tidy finish into the same corner.

MORE UNITED STORIES

Hugill is a mature striker tall and slim but muscular and intelligent enough to be a prolific goalscorer. He didn’t miss a single chance on Saturday afternoon. That speaks of confidence certainly but also serious quality.

The only disappointment is that he gave the second penalty for United to Amad Diallo who duly converted. He could have gone for the double hat-trick.

Hannibal Mejbri

Mejbri played on the left of a three-man attacking midfield behind Joe Hugill. It’s not a position as familiar to him as the central ones but he excelled. His work rate is outstanding and it’s not uncommon to hear United’s coaches bellowing ‘Hannibal’ from the touchline not to berate him but to ensure his teammates follow his example.

It was that workrate that led to United’s second goal. Mejbri pressed well and when the ball was played around him he continued chasing back and snatched the ball off of his opposite man. Looking up and seeing little space he deftly backheeled to the forward-running Puigmal. Puigmal fed Hugill and the ex-Sunderland striker finished well. The goal was made though by Mejbri’s tenacity and flair. It summed him up.

Nothing is a lost cause with Hannibal whether that is in terms of pressing and trying to win the ball back or when he has the ball himself even when it appears he’s lost the ball a flurry of footwork or a strong arm across sees him maintain possession. That footwork from Mejbri saw him win United two penalties in the second half.

Amad Diallo

It was his first appearance at any level for Manchester United and of course drew great interest. Diallo is quick in every part of his game: footwork acceleration pressing passing. He’s always looking for the quickest route to goal and plays with a flair and confidence. His performance showed all of that.

His first goal was a result of front-foot pressing from Diallo and then a cool finish past Marcelo. The second was a penalty. Diallo scored with a panenka. Confidence flair and quality.

It will be a very different challenge at first team level. Diallo will have less time will come up against stronger players with a better understanding of where he’s going to move. But this was an excellent start to life at United.",,,,,,,,,

For the past several years the comic strip Doonesbury has been in re-runs for its weekday strips; this past week’s series hailing from 1995 dated from the release of Windows 95 in which one of the strip’s characters pointed out the superiority of Apple’s Macintosh only to be brought back down to earth by the reality of Microsoft’s platform dominance.

More than a quarter of a century later Apple has become one of the most valuable and pervasive companies in the world but some things clearly haven’t changed that much. CEO Tim Cook said in the firm’s latest quarterly financial call “…we really don’t have a significant share in any market.” Cook was speaking specifically of the iPhone which is a minority in the smartphone market when compared to Android but the same can still be said of the Mac. Yet the company has always maintained an outsized presence even when it’s in the minority.

Cook continues to see that as an opportunity for Apple. When most people in the market aren’t already your customers that means they’re still potentially customers. And that theory seems to be borne out by the numbers; for years Apple has said that around half of those buying Macs or iPads in a quarter are new to the product.

But even with such a big potential market how do you convince people who haven’t already made the jump to switch?

Ice water in hell

Even for those who aren’t owners of Apple devices it’s become increasingly difficult to escape the reach of the Apple ecosystem. With an active installed base of 1.65 billion devices there’s a good chance that at least someone you know has an iPhone especially in the company’s more established markets.

More to the point with Apple’s push into services in recent years there are also more and more places where the company has gone outside of its comfort zone and brought the Apple brand to other platforms. For example when it launched Apple Music in 2015 Apple not only did so on its own devices but also on Android. More recently it teamed up with smart TV makers game consoles and competing set-top boxes to offer Apple TV+ rightly figuring that it needed to appeal beyond just existing Apple customers.

Apple has long had a presence on Windows too; first with iTunes in the iPod era and later with iCloud for Windows. This is all part of what Steve Jobs called the “glass of ice water in hell” strategy—showing people what life could be like on the other side of the fence. And Apple’s continued to extend its reach as recent rumors have shown that the popular iCloud Keychain password manager previously exclusive to Apple’s own devices may soon make the jump to Microsoft’s platform by means of a Chrome extension.

Where’s the beef?

Once the hook is in Apple does what any good company does: it competes. But where Apple has always been savvy is in prioritizing the experience* of technology. You might win over some converts by talking about quantitative specs like memory and processor speeds but Apple has realized it will get much more mileage out of emphasizing the qualitative: Ease of use. Good design. Privacy.

Apple Apple considers its priority on privacy a key selling point.

These differentiators are targeted at places where Apple’s competition has traditionally fallen short. Privacy is a particularly good example since several of the company’s biggest rivals in recent years have build their businesses on top of advertising and users are starting to realize just how invasive disruptive and potentially damaging such data collection can be. (Messaging that to be fair Apple has played a big part in promoting.)

This is about reframing the narrative and it’s savvy because the smartphone market is no longer a luxury market; it’s closer to a commodity. Like a car company Apple’s touting the smoothness of its ride and the convenience of cupholders not how many horses are under the hood.

The secret sauce

All of this wouldn’t amount to anything unless Apple could actually deliver on those claims it’s making and that’s where the company’s competitive advantage really comes to play. On last week’s financial call one analyst asked how Apple decides to enter a new market and one thing Tim Cook pointed to was finding a category where its expertise on hardware software services—and most importantly the tying together of same—could make a difference. (I would also add Apple’s retail stores as a significant factor providing an attractive and carefully controlled environment in which to showcase those products if not at this very moment in time.)

This unity of purpose is the great promise of the Apple ecosystem and while it’s not a promise on which the company always delivers when combined with those drips and drops of ice water and the reframed narrative that Apple has created it’s a strategy that work for Apple in drawing in a steady stream of new customers. After all you can’t really argue with a company that in just three months can pull in $100 billion.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNlbnRpbmVsYW5kZW50ZXJwcmlzZS5jb20vMjAyMS8wMS8zMC9uZXctZW5nbGFuZC1hcHBsZS1wcm9kdWN0cy1kb25hdGVzLWNpZGVyLXRvLWZvb2QtYmFua3Mv0gFsaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2VudGluZWxhbmRlbnRlcnByaXNlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzAxLzMwL25ldy1lbmdsYW5kLWFwcGxlLXByb2R1Y3RzLWRvbmF0ZXMtY2lkZXItdG8tZm9vZC1iYW5rcy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New England Apple Products donates cider to food banks,"LEOMINSTER – Family owned and operated New England Apple Products Company donated well over 25000 gallons of apple cider last year to several charitable organizations a true testament to the company’s commitment to community.

The company has donated cider nearly every fall and winter to Ginny’s Helping Hand in Leominster and Loaves & Fishes Food Pantry in Devens providing enough to accompany hundreds of holiday meals given out. They upped the ante in 2020 amid the pandemic.

“Last spring after hearing about the growing food insecurity problem across Massachusetts we decided to donate truckloads of cider and lemonade to the Greater Boston Food Bank which reaches scores of food pantries across the state” said CEO Steve Rowse.

All in all they donated six tractor trailer truckloads of cider and lemonade to the Greater Boston Food Bank last year to support its efforts in reducing the increased food insecurity that the COVID-19 pandemic has brought on.

“New England Apple’s packaging suppliers greatly assisted this initiative” the company stated in a press release. “Rocheleau Plastics of Fitchburg donated all of the half gallon bottles while Silgan Plastics headquartered in Connecticut donated colorful orange bottle caps Creative Labels of Vermont provided free labels and WestRock Company of Atlanta via their corrugated box plant in Devens provided cardboard shipping boxes.”

Rowse said they are “very grateful” to their packaging suppliers for helping with the effort.

“Their contributions allowed us to increase the volume that we’ve been able to donate to GBFB” he said.

Rowse said New England Apple has been doing OK during the pandemic; as such they are in a position to be able to help those in need.

“We were able to take advantage of government small business assistance programs and figured that this was the best way to give back” he said. “We donated another couple of truckloads of cider to Greater Boston Food Bank before Thanksgiving this fall in addition to the dozens of cases that went to Ginny’s and Loaves.”

Rowse purchased the apple cider-making equipment and other assets from Carlson Orchards of Harvard in the summer of 2011 and moved New England Apple Products to its current location on Industrial Road in North Leominster.

“The folks at City Hall in Leominster were really helpful when I was searching for that new home and I’m glad we landed here in Leominster” he said.

His younger brother Dave Rowse joined him at the company in 2013 as COO.

“He’s an engineering and operations guy and I really needed his help to ramp the cider business” Steve Rowse said.

While the company itself celebrates 10 years in business this year its roots go back to the end of the Civil War. The two brothers grew up in their family’s business Veryfine Products Inc. of Littleton which traces its roots back to 1865.

“Our family owned Veryfine for over 100 years but we sold that company in 2004 as competitive pressure from the big beverage companies had really intensified” Steve Rowse said. “I think the biggest lesson that we’ve carried over from our family’s Veryfine business is how we think about and work with our employees. Our success completely depends on our team and we like to think we treat them fairly and compensate them generously.”

The company instituted strict Department of Public Health and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention COVID-19 protocols and guidelines right when the pandemic hit. To date they have not had any confirmed cases in the cider mill.

“We did have to quarantine a few folks in the office for a couple of weeks last fall but everyone on our team is fine and has been terrific with adhering to the protocols keeping us all safe” Steve Rowse said.

While some of their customers who focus on institutions such as restaurants bars schools and cafeterias “have really struggled” he said their grocery store customers’ purchases “were very strong” this past fall during cider season.

New England Apple presses and bottles fresh apple cider for Carlson Orchards and several other southern New England orchards and also produces hard cider. Steve Rowse said the future of the company is bright and they look forward to continuing their community outreach efforts.

“Fresh cider is a healthy and growing business and we seem to be well positioned to continue to grow there” he said. “Our Carlson Orchards hard cider after some fits and starts to get it going is now on a rapid growth track and has a ton of upside. So in a nutshell we’re not done growing.”

Bloomberg

Elon Musk is going to pay $100 million towards a prize to come up with the best carbon capture technology. (Or so he tweets. Details are scarce so far.) The maverick tech CEO's promise is not particularly notable for its generosity. With a net worth of over $200 billion $100 million is 0.05% of Musk's wealth. But still the richest person in the world's tweet brings attention to an often-overlooked technology that has been around since the 1970s but has mostly been relegated to niche corners of the energy community. ""Mr. Musk's announcement reflects a maturation in the private sector around climate change and investment"" Julio Friedmann a senior research scholar at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University tells CNBC via email. ""As in the past Mr. Musk's announcement has shaken up the gumball machine.""

Why not just plant more trees?

Carbon capture from factory emissions: Where it stands

There are currently 21 large-scale CCUS commercial projects around the globe where carbon dioxide is taken out of factory emissions according to the International Energy Agency a Paris-based intergovernmental energy organization. The first one was set up in 1972. The earliest CCUS technology was used for enhanced oil recovery meaning the carbon dioxide is pumped into an oil field to help oil companies retrieve more oil from the ground Howard Herzog a senior research engineer at the MIT Energy Initiative and author of the book ""Carbon Capture"" tells CNBC. It wasn't until the 1980s that carbon capture technology was studied for climate mitigation efforts but even then it was ""mainly lone wolves"" Herzog says. By the 1990s ""activity really ramped up"" he says. One example in the United States is in Decatur Ill. where the food processing giant Archer Daniels Midland Company launched a carbon capture and storage project in 2017. It has the capacity to take 1.1 million tons of carbon per year out of the emissions released by a corn processing factory and stores that carbon a mile and a half underground.

For factory carbon-capture emissions are routed through a vessel with a liquid solvent which essentially absorbs the carbon dioxide. From there the solvent has to be heated up in a second tower — called a ""stripper"" or ""regenerator"" — to remove the CO2 where it's then routed for underground storage. The solvent can then be re-used in the first vessel or tower Herzog says. If the storing is done carefully ""you should be okay"" Herzog says. ""We don't have experience on the scale we want to go to"" Herzog says ""but we've demonstrated you could do it correctly."" The U.S. Department of Energy is on the case ""developing models that simulate the flow of stored carbon dioxide to help understand and predict chemical changes and effects of increased pressure that may occur.""

Carbon capture from the air: Where it stands

In terms of reversing global climate change there's already been too much carbon released into the atmosphere for us not to try and capture carbon and store it says Klaus Lackner the director of Center for Negative Carbon Emissions and professor at Arizona State University. ""The question of whether you want to store or not to store [carbon] was a very good question in 1980"" Lackner tells CNBC. ""But you needed to have this discussion 30 40 years ago because back then you still had a chance to stop the train before we collide with something."" The concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is tracked as in parts per million or PPM. As of December atmospheric carbon dioxide stands at 414.02 ppm according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. ""We started the industrial revolution with 280 parts per million in the atmosphere"" Lackner tells CNBC. ""By now we have 415 [ppm] and we are going up 2.5 ppm a year at this moment."" The consequences of that rising carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are already dire and will get worse. ""The oceans have started to rise hurricanes have gotten way worse climate has become more extreme and this will only get worse over the next decade"" Lackner says. The only choice Lackner says is to ""draw down"" the atmospheric carbon dioxide — or to suffer unknown devastating consequences. Capturing carbon from the air not from a factory smokestack is called ""direct air capture"" and there are currently 15 direct air capture plants in Europe the United States and Canada according to the IEA. ""Carbon removal is expected to play a key role in the transition to a net-zero energy system"" the IEA says but currently it is a very expensive technology. Direct air capture is ""very expensive because the CO2 in the atmosphere is only .04%"" Herzog tells CNBC and the technical process of removing carbon dioxide from a gas gets more expensive the lower the concentration of the carbon dioxide gets. ""But it is very seductive. A lot of people jumped on this"" he says. Lackner sees it as a necessity. ""In the end I see CO2 as a waste management problem. We have for two centuries simply dumped the waste from energy production — which is carbon dioxide — in the atmosphere and not thought about it any further and we are gradually waking up to the fact that that's not acceptable"" Lackner says.

The future of carbon capture technology

The technology exists to capture carbon and there is a grave need for climate change to be mitigated. So why isn't it being used everywhere already? The problem is economics says Herzog. ""It's cheaper to put [carbon dioxide] in the atmosphere. It is cheaper to let it go up the smokestack than put this chemical plant on the back of the smokestack to remove it"" Herzog says. ""Who is going to pay for that?"" To change that reality there must be economic costs to releasing carbon dioxide pollution into the atmosphere. ""The best capture technology will reduce these costs but it will never be zero. Hence even the best carbon capture technology will be useless if the world is not willing to put a price on carbon"" Berend Smit a Professor of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at the University of California Berkeley tells CNBC by email. His research focuses on finding the optimal material for carbon capture. In the meantime scientists and researchers are working to make current carbon capture technologies better. ""Over the past 10 years there are a number of innovations and improvements to enable us to save more energy and cost up to 70% less for new carbon capture processes"" Paitoon (P.T.) Tontiwachwuthikul a professor of industrial and process systems engineering at the Canadian Academy of Engineering and a co-founder of the Clean Energy Technologies Research Institute University of Regina tells CNBC by email. ""These include novel solvents (and their mixtures) as well as new process hardware items (e.g. new columns catalysts etc.)."" Smit is also working on how to use a kind of sponge ""with a strong affinity for carbon dioxide"" he says. ""Hence if we flow air through the sponge the CO2 gets removed. Once the material is saturated with CO2 we need to heat it pure CO2 comes out which we can then store. The sponge is empty and we can start over again.""

Lackner has developed a free-standing device to take carbon dioxide out of the air. ""Everybody's a machine out there right now they are sucking carbon dioxide or pushing carbon dioxide with fans and blowers ... we think that the wind alone is good enough to move the air around and our design aims to just be passively standing in the wind just like a tree."" While the technology has been demonstrated on campus it's still in its infancy. Fundamentally it all comes down to money. ""You need regulatory frameworks where basically if you want to dig up carbon you better show that you put an equal amount away"" Lackner says. ""If you have a cheaper way by all means do it first. if you don't have a cheaper way you have no excuse because this one will work.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

Gallagher's Recent Short Interest - Arthur J. Gallagher (NYSE:AJG),"Loading... Loading...

Arthur J. Gallagher's AJG short percent of float has risen 5.71% since its last report. The company recently reported that it has 2.11 million shares sold short which is 1.11% of all regular shares that are available for trading. Based on its trading volume it would take traders 2.65 days to cover their short positions on average.

Why Short Interest Matters

Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.

Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.

Cette attitude de l’opposant connu pour son opposition au 3ème mandat du Chef de l’Etat guinéen avait suscité beaucoup de réactions dans le pays. Beaucoup l’avaient accusé de retourner sa veste pour chercher à rentrer dans le gouvernement. Le président du Bloc Libéral a répondu à cette polémique assurant qu’il a participé à cette cérémonie dans le seul but de décrisper la situation politique et éviter au pays de sombrer dans une guerre civile.

« Après notre participation à l’investiture du président nous avons pris la parole pour dire que notre pays avait besoin que la tension baisse pour qu’on dialogue. Qu’on donne la chance à l’espoir d’exister dans notre pays. Je me félicite aujourd’hui qu’après notre passage à l’investiture que la presque totalité des acteurs majeurs de notre pays aient emboîté le pas au BL. Parce qu’il n’y pas un parti politique majeur aujourd’hui qui ne parle pas de dialogue en Guinée. Mais nous n’étions pas allés à l’investiture parce que nous avions un contrat d’être au gouvernement. Pas du tout.

Il faut que les Guinéens réalisent que nous sommes passés à un micron de la guerre civile dans notre pays. Imaginez l’effet que ça vous fait que la personne avec qui vous êtes né ensemble grandi ensemble dont vous avez donné vos enfants l’un à l’autre en mariage et soudain l’un a envie d’en finir avec l’autre. Vous ne voyez pas que nous étions en danger ? Est-ce qu’on voulait que le Rwanda ou le Liberia se reproduisent ici pour qu’on se rende compte du danger auquel on était exposés. En tant que parti patriote nous avons réalisé cela et on s’est dit qu’il faut qu’on travaille pour baisser la tension. Voilà la première raison.

La deuxième raison est que voilà combien de nos responsables sont en prison aujourd’hui ? Ousmane Gaoual et Cie sans oublier ceux qui sont là-bas et qui ne sont connus que par leur papa et leur maman. Ils sont par centaine là-bas. Le vœu du BL c’est de les voir libres. C’est le président de la République lui-même qui m’appelle pour me dire : je t’invite à l’investiture. Croyez-vous que je peux taper à toutes les portes pour le dialogue et que je refuse ce premier appel qu’on m’a lancé ? Je crois qu’il y a beaucoup qui n’ont pas compris ce que ma participation a apporté à la Guinée en termes de baisse de tensions dans le pays » se félicite Dr Faya Millimouno.

Siemens Energy shares soared 12% on Wednesday after the German renewables firm raised its forecast for the year and announced that the CEO of its troubled wind turbine unit will be replaced amid ""comprehensive restructuring measures.""

It said in a statement that Jochen Eickholt at Siemens Gamesa informed the board that he will step down from his position as CEO by mutual agreement on July 31 and be succeeded by Vinod Philip.

""In a very difficult situation at Siemens Gamesa Jochen laid the central foundations for the urgently needed reorganization and new start within Siemens Energy. It is only fair to emphasize that the causes of the quality problems did not fall under his tenure as CEO"" said Siemens Energy CEO Christian Bruch in a statement.

It said that Gamesa had initiated comprehensive restructuring measures and ""steps for long-term strategic development"" in order to boost operating margins.

Strong demand for power grid equipment amid the company's ""success"" in stabilizing the wind business led Siemens on Wednesday to raise its forecast for the year.

For the full year the company now expects a comparable revenue growth between 10% and 12% and a profit margin before special items between negative 1% and positive 1%. It previously forecast comparable revenue growth between 3% and 7% and a profit margin before special items between negative 2% and positive 1%.

Kardashian concentrated her jokes on Brady who she was once rumored to be dating.

“I’m really here tonight for Tom. I wasn’t going to come tonight but since I’m not here as Tom’s date there’s still a good chance I might” she joked.

Kardashian delivered another joke likening Brady’s appearance to her stepdad Caitlyn Jenner.

“I do know it would’ve never worked out” Kardashian said of a relationship with Brady. “An ex-athlete high cheekbones silky hair. … You remind me too much of my stepdad now.”

A meme showing “the evolution of Tom Brady” appeared on screen showing the transformation of Brady’s physical appearance and ending up looking like Jenner.

Kardashian continued: “Part of me thinks you would want to entrust me just to try on my clothes.

BOSTON (CN) — The First Circuit struggled at oral arguments Tuesday with a claim that it is unconstitutional for the Boston City Council to bar a group of Satanists from offering an invocation at its meetings.

“Suppose this was 1920s Boston and Jewish temples weren’t invited to speak” U.S. Circuit Judge William Kayatta said.

“I think you’d have a problem” the city’s lawyer Edward Whitesell conceded.

“So why not here?” Kayatta asked.

“Because the record shows that a lot of other religions were invited” to give invocations Whitesell answered.

Kayatta pressed on. “But there might have been a lot of other religions back then” he said. “Methodists. Lutherans. Isn’t this the exact same thing except we’re substituting Jews for Satanists?”

The lawsuit was brought by the Satanic Temple which was founded in 2013 and boasts that it’s the only Satanic organization that’s officially recognized as a religion by the IRS. It doesn’t believe in a literal Satan and operates in a gray area between a community of faith and a spoof of traditional religions drawing many members from the LGBTQ community. Last year it attracted some 800 attendees to SatanCon a gathering at the Boston Marriott.

The Boston City Council meets about three dozen times a year and typically begins meetings with a prayer poem or other introduction usually from a local religious leader. City councilors have absolute discretion as to whom to invite. From 2016 to 2018 the Satanic Temple repeatedly requested to speak and was rejected.

The invocations date from the 1800s and for years the city offered speakers a small stipend (a practice the temple calls “pray-for-pay”). But in 2017 the city abolished the payments at the suggestion of then-councilor Michelle Wu now Boston's mayor.

The temple claims the invitations favor some religions over others and thus violate the establishment clause of the First Amendment. It lost in the trial court.

One city councilor stated that it would be “absurd” to invite the temple to speak because it’s headquartered not in Boston but in nearby Salem (home of the witch trials). Another called the temple’s request a “publicity stunt” and added “I would not consider anyone that doesn’t have a positive impact on my community my constituents my family and me personally.”

In 2014 the U.S. Supreme Court held 5-4 that it's OK to start an official town meeting with a prayer. But in that case the town had compiled a list of local organizations and invited anyone who wanted to participate on a first-come-first-served basis including the chairman of a Baha’i temple and a Wiccan priestess.

By contrast Boston’s practice is “whim-based and politically motivated” said the Satanic Temple’s attorney Matthew Kezhaya of Minneapolis. “One councilor testified that this is a political reward. That’s a problem.”

Boston’s policy has “the potential for serious establishment clause concerns” agreed U.S. Circuit Judge Sandra Lynch a Bill Clinton appointee. “The system is designed to further the political careers of the Boston city councilors by permitting them to invite whoever is politically advantageous. Let’s assume … there is a consistent pattern of councilors choosing the majoritarian religion of their district and going on with effusive praise. Could there be an as-applied establishment clause problem?”

Whitesell said the temple would have to prove an intent to discriminate not just an intent to further a political career. “But that’s not the only route to an establishment clause issue” said U.S. Circuit Chief Judge David Barron a Barack Obama appointee. “If the selection criteria are whoever has the largest congregation” he said that would raise “very serious problems.”

Whitesell responded by insisting that the criteria aren’t merely political but also included recognizing civic leaders who had contributed to the welfare of the community. Kayatta also an Obama appointee then pressed Kezhaya on whether contributing to the community could be a valid selection criterion.

Kezhaya conceded that it could but he argued that in practice it’s impossible to separate that from the religious aspect and that the test isn’t applied neutrally because who benefits the community is determined by “whatever the councilor feels like.” He also said that the city had gone further and endorsed particular religions with “two to three minutes of gushing praise” for specific ministers which he called “religious gerrymandering.”

Before the Satanic Temple got involved 94% of invocations were given by Christians and the council president often told everyone in attendance to stand for prayers Kezhaya said.

Lynch asked if the Temple had contributed to Boston’s community welfare and Kezhaya answered that it had participated in the city’s pride parade and distributed free tampons to the needy.

“I’m confused as to the criteria” Kayatta complained. “Is it politics or who did good deeds?”

“They go hand-in-hand” Whitesell answered but Kayatta wasn’t satisfied: “On a Venn diagram they would overlap but not completely” he noted.

Barron closed out the argument by asking Kezhaya what he wanted as a remedy — did he want the judges to strike down Boston’s prayer practice altogether or did he want them merely to require the city to let the temple participate?

“We want in” Kezhaya answered.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA3L3BvbGwtc3R1ZGVudHMtaXNyYWVsLWhhbWFzLXByb3Rlc3Rz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,College students shrug at nationwide campus protests,"Data: Generation Lab; Note: Respondents selected up to three issues; Chart: Axios Visuals College protests against Israel's war in Gaza are dominating headlines. But only a sliver of students are participating or view it as a top issue according to a new Generation Lab survey shared exclusively with Axios. Why it matters: The poll hints that the war — and the accompanying protests — might not hurt President Biden's election prospects among young voters as much as previously thought.

By the numbers: Only a small minority (8%) of college students have participated in either side of the protests the survey of 1250 college students found.

Students ranked the conflict in the Middle East as the least important issue facing them out of nine options.

It landed behind health care reform racial justice and civil rights economic fairness and opportunity education funding and access and climate change.

What they found: The survey found that three times as many college students blame Hamas for the current situation in Gaza than they do President Biden.

Some 34% blame Hamas while 19% blame Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 12% blame the Israeli people and 12% blame Biden.

Zoom in: A large majority (81%) of students support holding protesters accountable agreeing with the notion that those who destroyed property or vandalized or illegally occupied buildings should be held responsible by their university per the survey.

A majority also said they oppose the protest tactics: 67% say occupying campus buildings is unacceptable and 58% say it's not acceptable to refuse a university's order to disperse.

Another 90% said blocking pro-Israel students from parts of campus is unacceptable.

The other side: Students were still more likely to say they support the pro-Palestininan encampments than oppose them.

45% said they support them either strongly or a little bit. 30% were neutral and 24% were strongly or a bit opposed.

Zoom out: More than 2000 people have been arrested on campuses across the U.S.

Worth noting: A majority of people (58%) who participated in or favored protests against Israel said they would not consider being friends with someone who has marched for Israel.

Meanwhile 64% of those who participated in a pro-Israel protest said they would still be friends with someone who has marched against Israel.

Methodology: This study was conducted May 3-6 from a representative sample of n=1250 students nationwide from 2-year and 4-year schools. The margin of error is +/- 2.7 percentage points. The Generation Lab conducts polling using a demographically representative sample frame of college students at community colleges technical colleges trade schools and public and private four-year institutions.

As protests raged around the world 1400 researchers signed an open letter calling on their colleagues to stop collaborating with police on algorithms and cities like Santa Cruz New Orleans and Oakland variously banned predictive policing facial recognition and voice recognition. But elsewhere police chiefs worked to deepen partnerships with tech companies claiming that the answer to systemic bias and racism was simply more data.

In her new book “Predict and Surveil: Data Discretion and the Future of Policing” sociologist Sarah Brayne slays that assumption with granular detail. An assistant professor at the University of Texas at Austin Brayne did months of fieldwork at the Los Angeles Police Department and other law enforcement agencies in the area tagging along as cops used software from Palantir PredPol and other companies. She learned that software vendors routinely show up at the department to peddle their wares like pharmaceutical representatives visiting doctors’ offices. She noted how police used an automated license plate reader mounted outside an emergency room to build out networks of victims’ associates. A sergeant explained that family or friends would often drop off an injured person and then speed away. With the automated license plate reader he said police could use plate numbers to determine who else was connected to the victim even if there was no other evidence linking them to a crime.

Riding along in department helicopters Brayne saw how data was used to justify extreme measures. In order to get a reduction in crime in one division police concluded that they had to fly helicopters overhead 51 times per week. They often increased that to 80 to 90 flyovers for good measure meaning that many residents’ days were regularly interrupted by the noise of buzzing choppers. The cops seemed to register the intrusion. They dubbed the copters “ghetto birds.”

Image: Courtesy Oxford University Press For years scholars and activists have critiqued the algorithms used in data-driven policing arguing that they merely techwash bias by making sloppy investigative work seem objective. Leading the charge in Los Angeles is the Stop LAPD Spying Coalition. Through public records requests the group’s activists have obtained documents on police use of data analytics and in 2018 they successfully pushed the city’s Office of the Inspector General to audit the department’s use of technology. “Surveillance is basically the tip of the policing knife” said Hamid Khan a co-leader of the coalition. “When you look at policing and the history of policing from our vantage point it’s not about public safety when it comes to nonwhite folks. It’s about the content to cause harm.” Big data he added simply gives police more ways to do that.

Brayne’s contribution is showing exactly how data is distorted in the hands of police. “Most sociological research on criminal justice has focused on those who are being policed” she told The Intercept. “I very deliberately wanted to flip the lens to focus on those doing the surveilling — on the police themselves.”

Andrew Guthrie Ferguson a law professor at American University and author of “The Rise of Big Data Policing: Surveillance Race and the Future of Law Enforcement” said that Brayne’s work is an unflinching look at what happens when people in power use emerging technologies. “Her book is a completely original inside look at the development of big data surveillance at the height of the first generation of its adoption” he said. “Sarah has been given access to the reality of big data policing in a way that no one else has — and probably because of her success no one else ever will.”

Operation LASER

Brayne first embedded with the department in 2013 as a 27-year-old graduate student. It was a critical moment for policing tech and the LAPD and other departments were ramping up their use of technology. The LAPD had signed on with Palantir Gotham which merges data from crime and arrest reports automated license plate readers rap sheets and other sources. The department also had a contract with PredPol which generates “boxes” or hot spots where property crimes like burglaries and auto theft are predicted to occur. A third program Operation LASER which stands for Los Angeles’ Strategic Extraction and Restoration program used a points-based system called a LASER score to evaluate the risk that individuals posed.

In Brayne’s first interview a captain boasted that the LAPD was at the forefront of technology adoption detailing how software that had been developed for counterterrorism work was helping the department ward off future crimes. Afterward Brayne asked to go on a ride-along with an officer. That trip revealed a more complicated picture. Instead of pulling up PredPol’s software on the laptop mounted to his dashboard the cop worked with a printout of PredPol’s hot spots. He explained that the department’s in-car laptops had trouble loading even standard internet browsers. So much for technological wizardry.

Brayne and the officer took a break to eat In-N-Out burgers under a highway overpass where they watched his colleagues bust up a grow operation and drag marijuana plants onto a flatbed truck. Then when they drove to a new location Brayne noticed that the officer typed in his address manually rather than let the car’s automatic vehicle tracker register his location. The union opposed officers being tracked he explained. While predictive policing systems had caught average citizens in an opaque dragnet police grew squeamish when the technology was turned back on them.

The notion that better technology can fix policing dates to at least the early 20th century. Back then police departments were closely tied to city government political machines. Arguing that a data-driven approach would make policing more professional reformers introduced tactics drawn from military operations including signal boxes telephone kiosks and pin mapping. The militarization of police accelerated during the 1960s and has continued to the present day to the point where even departments in placid American suburbs now have armored vehicles night vision viewers and bayonets.

“That’s a very visible manifestation of the militarization of policing” said Brayne. “But something that’s more invisible is this creep of surveillance software into the daily operations of policing.”

After 9/11 the Department of Homeland Security gave state and local police $35 billion in grants a portion of which was spent on developing data infrastructure. The infusion of cash created needs where there had been none. Police chiefs realized that the data they collected for Homeland Security could also be used for regular policing. In Los Angeles some officials came to believe that predictive analytics and big data might also solve the department’s many problems. The LAPD had been racked by a stream of high-profile scandals most infamously the 1991 beating of Rodney King. In 2001 the Department of Justice imposed a consent decree a court order mandating that the department conduct regular audits and capture more data on officers and crimes. (A spokesperson for the LAPD declined to comment for this article.)

A key figure behind the shift toward predictive policing was William Bratton who brought the data management system COMPSTAT to New York City before becoming the chief of the LAPD in 2002. Bratton oversaw the LAPD’s effort to merge various streams of data.

One result was Operation LASER which was funded with nearly a million dollars from the federal Bureau of Justice Assistance. When they came into contact with someone who seemed suspicious officers filled out a card with the person’s name address physical characteristics vehicle information gang affiliation and criminal history. Each new point of contact with police earned a person one additional point. “There are a lot of chickenshit violations you can stop someone for” a sergeant explained to Brayne during a ride-along. “Yesterday this individual might have got stopped because he jaywalked. Today he might have got stopped because he didn’t use his turn signal or whatever the case might be. So that’s two points.” The sergeant went on to argue that even such minor violations could help police predict the next crime because taken together they show “who is out on the streets.”

Such a system means of course that individuals in overpoliced neighborhoods can easily get caught up in a vicious cycle where they are as Brayne writes “more likely to be stopped thus increasing their point value justifying their increased surveillance and making it more likely that they will be stopped again in the future.” But some of the administrators whom Brayne encountered were apparently less interested in accuracy than they were in amassing more records. The goal one captain told her was simply to get people “in the system”: to capture larger and larger amounts of data on seemingly harmless individuals in the hope that the data would help solve a crime later on. Once an officer had a person in the system they could set an alert to automatically track changes in that person’s profile.

Brayne watched Los Angeles police fill out cards for Operation LASER and noted that they often listed the people who were with a person when they were stopped. She calls this a “secondary surveillance network.” You don’t actually need to have contact with police to be caught up in the system; you just need to have had contact with someone who did. Similarly Brayne learned that images captured by automated license plate readers sometimes showed the faces of people who were stopped with a person of interest. Those people too became data. When Brayne raised the issue of possible legal constraints around the rampant collection and sharing of information an employee in the Los Angeles County Chief Information Office declared bluntly “Consent is anachronistic.”

In some cases even being the subject of a query can boost someone’s suspiciousness. Brayne watched one detective search a national database for a juvenile. He remarked that he could see how many times other users had queried the same name. He claimed that the feature had helped police catch criminals because it told them other officers had suspected the same individual. When Brayne asked why that was useful he replied “Just because you haven’t been arrested doesn’t mean you haven’t been caught.”

Decades of research and years of cellphone videos have shown of course that police regularly target people who haven’t committed crimes. On ride-alongs Brayne watched cops run the plates of law-abiding drivers stopped at traffic lights just in case the numbers turned up a record. But the anecdote underscores how thoroughly big data reinforces existing police biases. One captain claimed “It’s just math.”

The World According to Palantir

In Brayne’s fieldwork Palantir’s technology came in for special praise. “They catch bad guys during every training class” one sergeant told her. A captain rhapsodized about the platform’s constant addition of new data sets marveling at the addition of foreclosure information: “I’m so happy with how big Palantir got.” Another said of Palantir “We’ve dumped hundreds of thousands [of dollars] into that. They are so responsive and flexible about what we want. They’re great. They’re going to take over the world. I promise you they’re going to take over the world.”

But up close the software was only as good as the people maintaining and using it. To make sense of Palantir Gotham’s data police often need input from engineers some of whom are provided by Palantir. At one point in her research Brayne watched a Palantir engineer search 140 million records for a hypothetical man of average build driving a black four-door sedan. The engineer narrowed those results to 2 million records then to 160000 and finally to 13 people before checking which of those people had arrests on their records. At various points in the search he made assumptions that could easily throw off the result — that the car was likely made between 2002 and 2005 that the man was heavy-set. Brayne asked what happened if the system served up a false positive. “I don’t know” the engineer replied.

There were dissenters. Some of the people tasked with implementing data-driven policing at the LAPD complained to Brayne that the software didn’t work as advertised. One person working in information technology said “Our command staff is easily distracted by the latest and greatest shiny object.” Data integration was uneven. Some divisions had certain software while others didn’t. Another employee told Brayne that the detective case management system was “sort of like a pimple” adding “they just like stuck it on top.”

When management was out of the room police were honest about their doubts. “Looks bitching but it’s worthless” one sergeant told Brayne of the LAPD’s data analysis infrastructure which is housed at the department’s Real-Time Analysis and Critical Response Division. One group of officers bought their captain a Ouija board to mock his faith in algorithms. A captain told Brayne that person-based predictive policing was “a civil liberties nightmare” and that he would never adopt it. (His division adopted it after he left.)

Activists who have fought for years against department use of technology told The Intercept that Brayne’s work is useful — but only to a point. “It was very helpful to uncover and learn about the extensive amounts of stuff that LAPD was doing” said Jamie Garcia an organizer with Stop LAPD Spying. “But then what?” In general she added she is tired of academics treating surveillance like a problem to observe and evaluate. “The information goes back to the ivory tower and the ivory tower has this conversation with themselves about what they think about it instead of that information being brought directly to the community.”

Brayne said that she hopes her work can be useful to a broad variety of people. “Transparency is the first step towards accountability” she said. “It is impossible to hold an individual or organization accountable if you don’t know what they’re doing.”

Forrest Stuart a sociologist at Stanford who studies policing said that her book is essential at a moment when anti-racism protests have prompted some law enforcement officials to further embrace technology as a means for reducing bias. “Some of the most popular proposed solutions to the over-policing and over-incarceration of black and brown communities have involved new technologies” he wrote in an email. “There is a sense that if we could just design a good enough computer program we could deploy police more fairly and reduce or perhaps even eliminate unwarranted disparities in criminal justice. Brayne’s book makes us take real pause and recognize the faults in this techno-optimist dream.”

The LAPD ended its contract with PredPol last April citing financial constraints brought on by the pandemic. Operation LASER ended in 2019. But a range of other companies including heavyweights like Amazon and Microsoft have moved into the space nationally and a guidebook published by the LAPD last year makes clear that big data will continue to prominently figure in policing in Los Angeles. Palantir meanwhile has lately expanded its access to data by moving into coronavirus tracking and vaccine safety analysis. Last year the company brokered lucrative contracts with the National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration. It went public in September. Since then its stock prices have more than tripled.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Hanneman Thomas ""Tom"" was born 6-29-52 in Lacrosse WI and passed unexpectedly at home in his sleep on 12-18-2020 at age 68. Tom was predeceased by his father an infant brother younger brother John and 6 weeks prior by his son-in-law Joe Tapper. Tom is survived by his wife and best friend of 44 years Nancy (Johnson) and their children and grandchildren: Adam and children Jack and Mia; Courtney Tapper and daughters Ryn Shae and Laine; Kyle and his wife Ashley. Tom is further survived by his mother Elaine and 6 siblings and their spouses and children: Diane Caroline Balch (Samantha and Henry) Jane (Charlie) Olson (Emily and Jennifer) Mary (Mick) Cochrane (Sam and Henry) Michelle Boeck (Carl) wife and son of John Jim (Margaret Spriggs) (Jane and Leo) Nancy (Mike) Sullivan (Avery and Melissa). He is also survived by Nancy's sister Donna (Wally) Abramson and their sons Erick (Bethany) Miles (Holly) and Alex. Tom moved to MN with his family in the 1960s. Tom and Nancy met while working in the toy department at Donaldson's department store in 1972 and married July 30 1976. Tom had a long successful career in television sports reporting starting at WCCO TV in 1973 then moving to radio and television broadcasting for the new Minnesota Timberwolves in 1989 including a stint with NBA Radio and then on to Fox Sports North in 2012. Tom received the Ray Scott Award for excellence in sports broadcasting in 2004 was a 14-time Upper Midwest Regional Emmy winner and was presented The Silver Circle Award Honoring an Extraordinary Career and Contributions to the Television Industry by the Upper Midwest chapter National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences in November 2020. He traveled extensively in his career - covering the 1984 Olympics in Sarajevo Yugoslavia the MN Twins 1987 World Series Championship run and each NBA team's home court numerous times. But his favorite place to be was at home with Nancy and all of their kids and grands gathered. Tom so loved and was so very proud of his family and cherished their time together. He was the best Boppa to 5 precious grands. Tom was afforded an opportunity to take Nancy on a working cruise with the NBA in 1994 they went reluctantly - and became converts to this way of vacationing. They tried to cruise annually - bringing their children going as a couple or with Donna and Wally and sending each of their newlywed kids on a honeymoon cruise. Tom was a self-described cruise nerd and encouraged anyone who would listen to try cruising. Tom suffered a heart attack and survived a sextuple bypass in July 2019. After arduous physical rehab he was determined to return to work and cohosted the Twins short run in the 2019 playoffs. Tom had a clever way with words was an unapologetic punster loved to joke was master of the Hanneman Pause was blessed with a mellifluous voice was honestly surprised when recognized and would always take time to talk. He would delight his grands with silly impersonations and stories and loved taking car rides to nowhere (causing some anxiety for the kids before GPS). He was fascinated by astronomy and NASA had a deep appreciation for old radios photographing clouds and collecting beautiful geodes. He will be forever missed and our hearts are shattered by his passing. One of our granddaughters said ""Boppa had an extra 18 months he could have died when he had his heart attack."" Tom used those extra months to connect with friends reconnect with old friends and tell each of his family members he loved them every time they spoke. Because of COVID we will gather to celebrate Tom when it is safe to do so. Please email CelebratingTomHanneman@gmail.com for details.

AXON,Axon Enterprise,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vYXRoZW5zcG9saXRpY3NuZXJkLmNvbS9zaG91bGQtcG9saWNlLWhhdmUtdGFzZXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Should police have Tasers? Eight arguments for and against,"The ACC Commission is currently considering a five-year $2.7 million contract with Axon Enterprise Inc. for new Tasers and body-worn cameras for the ACC Police Department. Contracts like this might have passed easily in previous years but recently the commission has been examining matters related to policing very closely. The current proposal has been controversial and was discussed at length by the commission in a three-hour work session in January.

Commissioners Mariah Parker and Carol Myers have voiced support for reducing the Taser part of the contract to two or three years only to avoid locking ACCPD into a long-term commitment that Athenians may not want or need. With two different citizen groups (Mokah Jasmine Johnson’s Civilian Oversight Board and a new Safety and Justice advisory committee) in the process of forming Parker and Myers may wish to hear community opinion before feeling comfortable voting to approve or reject a long contract.

Commissioner Jesse Houle

Several other commissioners also had questions about ACCPD deployment of Tasers but none were as stridently opposed to their continued use as Commissioner Jesse Houle. Houle sent an email to their colleagues on January 28 “strongly urg[ing]” them to consider denial of the Taser part of the Axon contract. This email was well-researched and contained links to a wealth of information on the potential risks and benefits of Taser devices.

With the commission set to vote on the Axon contract this Tuesday let’s dig into the data provided by Houle as well as the data provided by ACCPD in their presentation at the work session on January 14. [UPDATE 2/16/21: The vote was pushed back until today. The Taser contract passed 8-2 with only Houle and Parker voting no.]

Are Tasers a safe and effective means of apprehending suspects and an important part of the use-of-force spectrum for police? Or are they dangerous and fragile devices designed primarily to provide monopoly profits for Axon without providing much in the way of public benefit?

Let’s take a look!

Wait what’s a Taser again?

Tasers are electroshock devices that can operate in two modes: dart mode and drive stun mode.

Dart is the most commonly-used mode which allows police officers to stun people at a range of about 25 or 30 feet. When the trigger is pulled the device will fire two electrode darts capable of piercing skin and clothing. With both electrodes embedded in the target the electrical current makes a complete circuit allowing electricity to flow into the target’s body through one electrode and back out through the other. A successful hit with both electrodes will normally incapacitate the target allowing officers to take them into custody.

An example of ACCPD using a Taser to apprehend a man in 2016.

Tasers in drive stun mode are hand-held devices and thus have a much shorter range. This mode is used to shock the target causing extreme pain as a way of forcing compliance. Despite the name drive stun mode does not normally stun or incapacitate the target; the purpose here is to cause pain.

The word Taser is both an acronym and a brand name. It stands for — no joke — Thomas A Swift’s Electric Rifle. Apparently the inventor of this technology was a big fan of the Tom Swift adventure novels.

Axon formerly known as Taser International is the largest manufacturer of these devices in the world essentially having a monopoly on the technology. Axon maintains its dominant market position by either buying up competitors or devastating them with copyright lawsuits.

The argument for Tasers

The Taser contract will save taxpayer money

This contract bundles together maintenance costs for both body cams and Tasers providing a savings of $400000 over the five-year contract period according to ACC Manager Blaine Williams. This is why the Taser question is even coming up at all — Williams is trying to save taxpayer money.

Tasers are safe and effective

Once ACCPD realized that the contract was meeting opposition they prepared a presentation defending their use of Tasers to the commission. During this presentation Captain Harrison Daniel explained that Tasers are effective devices that can help police apprehend suspects safely. He continually stressed that giving police more options at different levels of force can only help them in their goal of providing safety to the public.

“The more options we have the more opportunity we have to create a safe outcome” Daniel said.

While admitting that “there is no perfect tool” Daniel cited a 2012 study showing that in 1201 Taser applications by police nationwide only 0.25% resulted in a moderate or severe injury to the recipient. These injuries usually result from falls after the subject is stunned but ventricular fibrillation (an abnormal heart rhythm that is potentially fatal) is also possible in rare circumstances.

Daniel also presented ACCPD data from 2019 showing that Tasers are completely effective in their role at immobilizing subjects 75% of the time and partially effective 11% of the time. They are ineffective only 14% of the time usually when the police officer misses with one or more of the darts or when the person targeted is wearing heavy clothes.

ACCPD’s Taser policy is very restrictive

While some police departments around the country have very relaxed rules regarding use of Tasers ACCPD takes their use very seriously and has a number of restrictions that make them even safer to deploy.

For example ACCPD has restrictions against Tasering pregnant women children or the elderly except in extreme circumstances. Likewise if a suspect is in a precarious position where they might take a dangerous fall after suddenly losing control of their muscles Tasers are highly restricted in Athens. Presumably this means they would be allowed in these circumstances only when deadly force was also allowed although Daniel did not directly state this.

As a way of further increasing safety all ACCPD Tasers shut off automatically after five seconds of electrical discharge. They do not have to be configured this way; many police agencies allow victims to be shocked for as long as the officer holds the Taser’s trigger. However that would be “too much of a risk” according to Daniel. ACCPD officers must justify each trigger pull individually to make sure the “electrical current doesn’t reach a dangerous level.”

It’s important to note that Tasers are used very infrequently in Athens as well. ACCPD officers deployed Tasers only 33 times on average over the past 4 years according to Daniel’s presentation.

Tasers prevent injuries and save lives

Lastly Daniel claimed that Tasers are safer for both police officers and suspects than other weapons such as clubs or of course guns. He implied that if police have access to Tasers fewer police officers and members of the public would be harmed during normal police procedure.

Commissioner Patrick Davenport

Commissioner Patrick Davenport agreed saying “as a Black man I’d rather be Tasered than shot.” ACCPD Police Chief Spruill who is also Black spoke passionately in defense of Tasers. “How much is one person’s life worth? If we save one person’s life a year because we have Tasers they’re worth it.”

The argument against Tasers

Tasers are expensive to taxpayers

The Taser part of the contract amounts to about $230000 per year to replace and service ACCPD’s Taser X-26s with new Tasers 7s. If this is being done solely as a way to save taxpayer money it would be even cheaper not to do it at all.

In their email to the commission Houle points out the poor bargaining position that Athens has in negotiating with a monopoly producer like Axon. Monopolies tend to drive up prices at the expense of quality over time so we might end up paying even more in the future for a worse product.

“Given the built-in obsolescence of these devices we can expect similar if not greater pricetags in perpetuity” Houle wrote.

Some reports indicate that the new Taser 7s are actually less reliable with a higher miss rate than the current model in use by ACCPD.

One police officer’s opinion on the Taser 7. “It’s a piece of crap.”

Tasers can be harmful even deadly

Amnesty International has tracked at least 500 people who died after being shocked by Tasers from 2001 to 2012 in the US.

Axon denies that Taser application had anything to do with these deaths. The company makes repeated claims that their products are safe supported by scientific studies that they fund themselves. Unsurprisingly these studies come back saying that Tasers are safe and that they are not responsible for any deaths that happen after subjects are shocked.

Nearly 30% of the studies cited by Axon in defense of Tasers were funded by them or have at least one author who has been paid by Axon as an employee or consultant according to Reuters. Axon maintains close relationships with researchers and police agencies alike and is quick to make legal challenges against anyone who challenges their narrative regarding the safety of these devices.

However the study presented by Daniel finding that Tasers cause mild or no injury 99.75% of the time does not appear to have been funded by Axon and there are many similar studies showing the same thing both in the field (like the study Daniel presented) and in more controlled experiments. It’s safe to say that Tasers are safe… when used on healthy sober white male police officers who are almost always the only volunteer test subjects for these weapons.

When Tasers are used in the field the target population is quite different than the ones used in most studies. In their review of the academic literature on Tasers the Stanford Criminal Justice Center cites a 2011 study showing police more often than not tend to use Tasers on those under the influence of alcohol or illegal drugs or on those with mental illness.

Stanford researchers then quote the Police Executive Research Forum’s 2011 guidelines on Tasers which warn of a “higher risk of sudden death in subjects under the influence of drugs and/or exhibiting symptoms associated with excited delirium.” Put together this means those whom Tasers are most likely to be used against are simultaneously the most vulnerable to their affects and the least studied.

Even if Tasers are found to be almost always safe they can be dangerous in certain circumstances. For example Tasers can be dangerous for those with pacemakers or when the darts strike an unapproved area such as the face or upper chest.

Tasers may do very little to prevent civilian injuries or save lives

The research on Tasers consistently shows that Tasers do reduce injuries to police officers who have access to them as claimed by Daniel and Spruill. These are typically minor to moderate injuries resulting from a hands-on approach to taking suspects into custody that is avoided with the use of Tasers.

But when looking at injuries to civilians the story can be quite different depending on the study. While many researchers do find a correlation between Tasers and reduced civilian injuries the Stanford Criminal Justice Center doubts this conclusion. They found methodological errors in many studies and pointed to others showing that Tasers can actually increase injuries to suspects.

Stanford researchers were unable to come to a solid conclusion about whether Tasers decrease injuries to civilian suspects finding that the results of the studies often depend on the assumptions held by those doing the experiment. They lament the lack of good data and reliable research on this topic saying that “even the best empirical studies in this field are riddled with caveats that limit the confidence readers can place in their results.”

However when it comes to the life-saving potential of Tasers things are a bit clearer. After exhaustively searching the scientific literature Stanford researchers conclude that “there is very little evidence to support th[e] claim” that Tasers reduce the use of lethal force by police.

Houle made this point in the work session asking police why Tasers were not deployed during any of the six police shootings in Athens in 2019. Spruill responded by saying “when you have a person who is within a few inches of striking you in the face with a machete those are not the kind of situations when the Taser would be appropriate. Deadly force will be the response for deadly force against the officer.”

Tasers can discourage police from using de-escalation tactics

Lastly the Stanford review notes one study where the researchers express concern that the availability of Tasers may actually discourage the use of de-escalation techniques by officers. Unfortunately Stanford “found no research that attempted to directly compare the effects of de-escalation techniques” with that of Taser deployment. So it’s currently unclear if de-escalation tactics could reduce or even eliminate the need for Tasers but the possibility exists.

Conclusion

Despite the completion of numerous large-scale national studies on the use of Tasers by police much about the effects of these electroshock weapons still remains unclear.

The most robust finding in their favor is that they tend to reduce injuries suffered by police in the line of duty. This may be enough for the commission to approve the $230000 a year it takes to upgrade ACCPD’s Taser equipment to the new Taser 7s and provide for ongoing maintenance for them but that’s a far cry from claims that the devices are a lifesaving necessity.

However even if the commission refuses the contract ACCPD will continue to use the older X-26 models going forward. Currently only 42% of ACCPD’s Tasers are covered by warranty and if they break ACCPD will likely purchase newer models to replace them anyway.

Therefore it’s best not to look at the commission’s decision on Tuesday as a final decision on the use of Tasers in Athens. The civilian task forces being formed will have a chance to weigh in on this question regardless of what the commission decides. This is perhaps only the beginning of a larger discussion on Tasers and the use-of-force by police more broadly in Athens.",,,,,,,,,,,,

They are obviously a sponsor there too along with having naming rights of the Avs’ home building now).

There was no morning skate today and thus no media availability with the coach so I don’t have any lineup information other than who is starting in goal. Coach Jared Bednar said last night that he didn’t expect Erik Johnson to be a player for today.

It should be quite a good feeling tonight for Miska as he is a Minnesota native (from North Branch). Too bad his family and friends can’t be in the stands to watch though.

By the way Zach Parise had some pretty nice things to say about the Avs last night:

Parise: “That team is good. They’re the class of the league. They play a good style of hockey. They’re fast. Their top line is arguably one of the best in the league. So it was a little different type of game than we had played in the first eight.” — Sarah McLellan (@sarah__mclellan) January 31 2021

The conspiracy-minded part of me wonders if Parise is just saying that to butter the Avs up too much maybe soften ’em up a bit.

We’ll have full coverage of the game tonight right here so check back soon.",,,,,,,,,

Last week the Reddit forum WallStreetBets waged a war against the establishment. A large group of retail investors from the forum pushed up the prices of stocks such as GameStop (GME) and AMC Entertainment (AMC) which had been heavily shorted by hedge funds essentially attempting to play the firms at their own game.

This fight between retail investors and Wall Street is an acceleration of the growing war on inequality said Bank of America's chief investment strategist Michael Hartnett in a January 29 note.

This builds upon Hartnett's previous examination of the topic; in May 2020 he highlighted that the new decade would bring ""big change"" with a shift from deflation to stagflation a simultaneous increase in inflation and stagnation of economic output.

The era of quantitative easing seen over the last decade has driven incredible inequality on Wall Street said Hartnett in May.

""Never in the field of monetary policy was so much gained by so few at the expense of so many"" he added.

Due to the pandemic and recession policy makers forced investors to buy banks to lend and corporate zombies to issue bonds he said in May noting that this could change after the US election with payback via taxes and a focus on regulation and wealth redistribution.

""The ability of private equity financial engineering and stock buybacks to drive asset prices will vanish"" Hartnett said.

The end of a bull market

The WallStreetBets retail investor fury has accelerated Hartnett's original position on the war on inequality.

In 2020 he said society would reach ""peak capitalism"" in the coming decade a point at which capitalism would no longer survive. Hartnett's most recent research note at the end of January suggests society could have already reached that point.

2021 will bring the end of the bull market Hartnett said — an event that will be triggered by the following three events:

1) Regulation (also a trigger for ""peak capitalism"")

Having the Democrats in the White House and in control of Congress had already meant regulatory changes were coming. But after what has happened in the markets over the last week there could also be widespread regulatory changes facing Wall Street trading platforms and investors.

""Regulation aimed solely at new investors simply will sustain the bull market in anger"" Hartnett said.

2) Rates

The US 10-year Treasury has already started to slowly rise. And with GDP growth increasing as COVID-19 vaccines get rolled out and a recovery gets underway interest rates are expected to rise even faster.

Interest rates typically create challenges for growth stocks which have been one of the main beneficiaries in the bull market rally.

3) Redistribution (also a trigger for ""peak capitalism"")

Inequality can only end with higher wage inflation for the poor and wealth taxation for the rich Hartnett said which could redistribute the wealth from Wall Street to Main Street.

Early 2020s outlook

The combination of these triggers will spell a lower and more volatile market in coming quarters. Hartnett is expecting a 10% correction in the second quarter of this year.

Long-term he predicts the end of the bull market will bring bigger government more localization dollar debasement and fiscal excess.

This would be the polar opposite of the early '80s which brought deflationary economic policies such as globalization deregulation and privatization.

Instead the early 2020s would look more like the 1970s with stagflation a situation Hartnett initially laid out in May.

""We do think asset returns will mirror the stagflationary 1970s in that they will be low in real terms (nominal too around 3-5%) as well as volatile and clustered across asset classes"" said Hartnett in May.

So how do investors position?

Own inflation assets and sell deflation assets Hartnett said. He also advised owning real assets instead of financial assets.

Inflation assets are those that perform well in an inflationary environment. Back in May Hartnett noted that previous stagflation winners were small-cap value and energy stocks as well as commodities REITS and real estate.

One of the biggest risks to this outlook is that the bears are ""too early"" and that market events incite more liquidity. The Federal Reserve could continue to have even more accommodative monetary policy in the second quarter. However this would coincide with GDP and profit growth recoveries as well as inflation and visible signs of Wall Street speculation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjAvMDEvMDIvYnVzaW5lc3MvZGVhbGJvb2svY2FybG9zLWdob3NuLWphcGFuLWxlYmFub24uaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Did Carlos Ghosn Flee Japan?,"… and we’re back!

Stephanie Cohen Goldman Sachs JP Yim

When Adena Friedman the CEO of Nasdaq hosted a dozen executives for dinner at her home in June 2018 it marked the first encounter for one of Wall Street's most senior women and another up-and-comer.

Stephanie Cohen then a chief strategy officer at Goldman Sachs impressed Friedman with her penchant for bringing multiple perspectives to bear on a conversation.

""She's witty and funny. She's incredibly smart. And she's what I call a three-dimensional thinker"" Friedman told Insider. ""So it's just a lot of fun.""

Cohen is now a formidable Wall Street figure in her own right. Six weeks after meeting Friedman Cohen became the youngest person to join Goldman's management committee. Last November she and Tucker York credited with building the bank's private wealth business were handed oversight of Goldman's consumer and wealth-management division the home of grand ambitions to go toe to toe with JPMorgan in consumer banking.

Retail investors — especially from the subreddit Wall Street Bets — helped force one of the top-performing hedge funds of the past half-decade to secure billions in emergency funding from two ultracompetitive peers.

Now funds are planning to keep as close of an eye as possible on the social-media platform. One data scientist at a fund told Insider they created a scraping tool this weekend to monitor tickers being discussed on the site to make sure their fund's short book isn't caught in the next ""YOLO"" trade. Thinknum a web-scraping data provider is in the process of building a Reddit-specific dataset after insane client demand.

It’ll hang there until the next time you need to towel off—unless it needs to be washed that is. But how often should you really change out your bath towel for a fresh one?

There’s a certain number of days to be mindful of before your towel becomes a breeding ground for bacteria. Plus using a fresh clean bath towel is not only good for your personal hygiene but for your overall health. Ahead find what experts have to say when it comes to how often you should change your bath towel.

This Is How Often You Should Change Out Your Bath Towel

According to Annie Chiu MD a board-certified dermatologist and founder of The Derm Institute there's a clear guidance on when to make the swap.

“Generally you should change your towels every three to four uses” she says. “This helps prevent the buildup of bacteria and odors.”

It’s important to stick to this clean towel schedule for a few reasons Chiu notes. Bacteria dead skin cells and excess oils from your skin can build up on wet towels. So when a dirty towel is used you run the risk of creating skin infections or exacerbating existing skin conditions like acne.

Factors That Affect When You Should Swap Out Your Towel

That said several factors can impact the length of time you keep a towel in your rotation.

How Smelly It Is

If a towel looks unclean or starts to smell before three uses you should change it sooner Chiu says.

How Often You Shower

On the flip side if you shower every day you might be able to use your towel a few more times before changing it.

How Much You Sweat

“However if your workout or job causes you to sweat a lot you should change your towel more frequently” she adds. “The same applies to those who live in humid climates—because towels may take longer to dry increasing the risk of bacterial growth and odor.”

Your Towel's Material

Your towel’s material can also come into play. Waffle weave towels for example tend to dry more quickly than typical terrycloth towels.

“Thanks to the waffle weave construction of our towels we have found that they do generally dry faster than a traditional cotton terry towel” explains Jason Gutierrez cofounder of textile company Geometry. “In our experience a quicker-drying towel lends itself to more uses between washes.”

Gutierrez estimates swapping out a waffle weave towel every seven to 10 days while also considering how often the towel is being used where and how it is stored in between uses and the humidity and temperature of the area where the towel is hung.

Pollutants in the Environment

“Factors such as exposure to pet dander smoke or outdoor pollutants can also affect towel cleanliness and may necessitate more frequent changes” say the product experts at bedding and linens company Cozy Earth.

When Should You Throw Away Towels?

After swapping towels in and out over a few years your bath towel may start to lose its softness fluff and absorbency. “If your towels no longer absorb water effectively and feel less soft and plush than they used to it may be time for replacements” say the experts at Cozy Earth. “Over time towels can lose their absorbency due to wear and tear or the buildup of detergent residue.”

Similarly if your towels are exposed to chlorine and sunlight that makes a difference in their longevity as do washing habits and how often you use them.

When properly cared for a typical towel's lifespan is about two years (less if they're heavily used more if they're mainly for display).

“Personally once my towel starts to show signs of wear such as fraying I know it has lived its life and it's time for a new one” says Gutierrez. “I have several Geometry waffle bath towels that have been in my towel rotation for years and are still going strong. They’re quite durable in terms of construction and functionality but like all textiles they do eventually wear out.”

Don't throw your towels away though! There's plenty you can do with them like donating them to animal shelters or turning them into cleaning rags.

Whimsical wordplay aside the question would become a serious one for mid-century America as parsons and priests blamed jazz for soaring juvenile crime rates drugs and extramarital sex. A 1960 poll found that among Black preachers just 1 in 5 wanted to let jazz or blues into their services. Decades before a religion editor at the Pittsburgh Courier had denounced Louis Armstrong’s “sacrilegious desecration of Spirituals.” Duke Ellington’s music was “considered worldly” counseled the Rev. John D. Bussey explaining why the local 1966 Baptist Ministers Conference had unanimously passed his resolution opposing a performance.

But whatever commandments they were breaking—and there were plenty from slighting the Sabbath to serial adultery—Duke Louis and king of swing Count Basie all seemed to take the Christian faith they’d been raised in seriously. And that faith found its way into their music.

For Louis Armstrong the connection was there from the very beginning when he learned to sing in his mother’s Sanctified church. “The ‘whole ‘Congregation would be “Wailing—‘Singing like ‘mad and ‘sound so ‘beautiful” he wrote with his characteristic expressive idiosyncratic punctuation. “I’d have myself a ‘Ball in ‘Church especially when those ‘Sisters ‘would get ‘So ‘Carried away while ‘Rev’ would be ‘right in the ‘Middle of his ‘Sermon. ‘Man those ‘Church ‘Sisters would ‘begin ‘Shouting ‘So—until their ‘petticoats would ‘fall off. … My heart went into every hymn I sang” he added. “I am still a great believer and I go to church whenever I get the chance.”

With Saturday night performances that stretched into Sundays that wasn’t often. But nearly half a century later Armstrong released an album the church sisters would have loved Louis and the Good Book with gassed-up versions of spirituals including “Go Down Moses” and “Nobody Knows the Trouble I’ve Seen.” He recorded “When the Saints” the anthem of the Big Easy more than 100 times.

Count Basie was raised in the Black church too. Two of his uncles were ministers; his father was a founder and pillar of Pilgrim Baptist Church in Red Bank New Jersey. In oral histories and writings fellow musicians and friends use the word spiritual to describe what Basie brought to the band. Sideman Harry “Sweets” Edison compared their group to church organists and singers who inspire congregants to “get up to shout.” Basie was a spiritual presence offstage too. “Prior to eating he would do this elaborate silent prayer” recalls tenor saxophonist Eric Schneider. If the food came before he was finished “it was understood that we should go ahead and eat.”

Duke Ellington was perhaps the most pious of the three maestros. Growing up he attended two services each Sunday: African Methodist Episcopal Zion with his father Baptist with his mother. As a young man he consulted the Bible twice a day sometimes taking the book into the bathtub and reading until the water got cold. Though he shunned most jewelry he wore a gold crucifix around his neck and carried a St. Christopher medal in his hip pocket. His Christmas card bore a simple message in gold lettering: LOVE GOD.

In the last ten years of his life Ellington devoted himself to a series of sacred concerts performances that brought together jazz and classical music spirituals gospel and the blues. Suddenly he was getting more invitations to play in churches than in dance halls. Synagogues too. “These are things people don’t know about him” said singer-songwriter Herb Jeffries. “He had a great ministry. It was hidden in his music. … He was practicing his ministry moving about here and there making people happy!” When a reporter asked how he “as a religious man” could “play in dark dingy places where depravity and drunkenness reign” Ellington whispered “Isn’t that exactly what Christ did—went into the places where people were bringing light into darkness?”

He also pushed back against preachers who accused him of defiling their churches with his concerts. “Some people ask me what prompted me to write the music for the sacred concerts. I have done so not as a matter of career but in response to a growing understanding of my own vocation” Ellington wrote in his memoir. “I think of myself as a messenger boy one who tries to bring messages to people not people who have never heard of God but those who were more or less raised with the guidance of the church.” The sacred concerts this most accomplished of composers and bandleaders added were “the most important thing I have ever done.” They were important to audiences too. Take the girl who approached Ellington after one performance telling him “You know Duke you made me put my cross back on!”

Sacrilegious then isn’t the word to describe these jazzmen. Yes their faith was unorthodox and imperfect. But it also was warmly ecumenical and personally sustaining. You can hear it not just in their Christmas tunes but in all of their jazz music rooted in the gospels and Negro spirituals they grew up with. Their abiding belief in God all three maestros made clear is what emboldened and empowered them to write the soundtrack to the Civil Rights revolution to shape the soul of America.

According to his son Mercer Duke Ellington “was quite taken with the story of the ‘Juggler of Notre Dame.’” It’s a parable that applies to Armstrong and Basie too. “The man was a great juggler who would sneak into the church and juggle before the altar. As the story goes the priests found out about it and kicked him out. God intervened and told the priests to leave him alone. The man was celebrating His presence by using the gifts that He gave him.”

The Mary Tyler Moore Show became one of television’s most popular sitcoms when it premiered 1970. With star Mary Tyler Moore at the helm along with co-stars Ed Asner (Lou Grant) Ted Knight (Ted Baxter) Gavin MacLeod (Murray Slaughter) Valerie Harper (Rhoda Morgenstern) Betty White (Sue Ann Nivens) and Cloris Leachman (Phyllis Lindstrom) series was considered Must-See TV during its seven-season run.

With Knight’s character playing a hilariously buffoonish anchor man the actor began having his doubts on how portraying the dimwitted newsman would affect his reputation.

Ted Baxter wasn’t a typical journalist

The role of WJM’s lead newsman Ted Baxter got plenty of laughs from audiences. Known for being vain self-serving and ignorant the on-air journalist was often the butt of jokes on The Mary Tyler Moore Show. Still Knight’s portrayal of Ted Baxter was so brilliant he brought home two Emmys for Best Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series.

Yet Knight soon felt the vanity and stupidity of his character would negatively impact his career. In her memoir After All Moore recalled the actor visiting show producer Allan Burns in season 3 with great concerns over his role.

“[Knight] entered as Allan remembers it with an expression of pain on his face” Moore wrote. “He stood there wordlessly extended both arms in a helpless gesture… slowly shook his head from side to side unable to speak.”

Ted Knight didn’t want to be viewed as stupid

According to Moore when Burns asked Knight what was troubling him he broke down in tears.

“Ted flung his arms around Allan’s neck and sobbed ‘I can’t do it anymore'” Moore revealed. “‘I can’t play Ted Baxter. Everybody thinks I’m stupid and I’m not. I’m an intelligent well-read man and everyone treats me like I’m a schmuck.'”

Knight was so distressed he was contemplating ending his tenure on the sitcom despite its success.

“His tears were real” Moore wrote. “Who knows what tipped him over the edge at that moment but Ted was actually considering leaving the show he felt so humiliated by what he saw as character takeover.”

‘Mary Tyler Moore’ producer gave Ted Knight a pep talk

Burns was able to help Knight realize the talent he possessed which brought the character of Ted Baxter to life.

“With all modesty Allan recalls delivering an inspired talk” Moore explained “using examples of the great comedians throughout time whose intellect and soul brilliantly shone through the clowns they’d created and whose contributions to the hallowed halls of laugher inspire reverence for their commitment.”

The words of wisdom from Burns were enough to prompt Knight to reconsider… despite another member of the production team ruining the moment with a classic blunder.

“Ted was ready to go out there for the Gipper” Moore recalled. “Co-producer Jim Brooks walks in slapped Ted on the back saying ‘Ah Ted Ted Ted the world’s favorite schmuck.'”

Despite Brooks’ foot-in-mouth moment Knight remained on The Mary Tyler Moore Show until the series ended in 1977.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJveGluZ3NjZW5lLmNvbS9tb2UtemF3YWRpLWRlY2lkZXMtdHVybi1wcm8taW5rcy1wcm9tb3Rpb25hbC1hZ3JlZW1lbnQtLTE1NTA4MdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Moe Zawadi Decides To Turn Pro Inks Promotional Agreement,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.boxingscene.com', port=443): Read timed out.

Steve Cohen’s hedge fund Point72 has become entangled in market turmoil that has pitted a band of small investors against traders that made bets against — or “shorted” — stock of companies including GameStop.

Hedge funds that shorted GameStop have lost billions as small investors bid up the company’s shares. One of the short sellers Melvin Capital announced this week that it received a $750 million infusion from Point72.

“I’ve really enjoyed the back and forth with Mets fans on Twitter which was unfortunately overtaken this week by misinformation unrelated to the Mets that led to our family getting personal threats” Cohen said Saturday in a statement issued by the Mets. “So I’m going to take a break for now.”

Twitter users looking for Cohen’s account Saturday got a message reading “This account doesn’t exist. Try searching for another.”

The hedge fund billionaire told Mets fans “We have other ways to listen to your suggestions and remain committed to doing that.” He added that this week’s events would not affect the team’s resources.

Cohen first took a stake in the Mets in 2012. Last year he gained 95% ownership in a deal that valued the club at $2.4 billion a record sale price for a Major League Baseball team.

The Mets tied for last place in the National League East division last season.

CLAIM: President Joe Biden swore on a ""Masonic/Illuminati"" Bible during his inauguration last week.

THE FACTS: Following Biden's inauguration false social media posts spread about the Bible he used to take his oath of office. Some social media users falsely suggested the several-inches thick Bible a Biden family heirloom was ""Masonic"" or associated with an Illuminati conspiracy.

Conspiracy theorists suggest the Illuminati a purported secret society wants world domination. Freemasons a fraternal organization have been the subject of conspiracy theories since the group was founded over 300 years ago. Some founding fathers were even part of the group.

""Sooo has anyone else realized this yet or???? Masonic/Illuminati Bible that Biden swore on yesterday..."" wrote one Facebook user along with a photo of Biden's hand on the Bible. The false post had 19000 shares.

But in fact Biden was sworn in on a Douay-Rheims Bible an English translation of a Latin Bible. The Bible has been in the Biden family since the 1890s. He used the same Bible when he was sworn in twice as vice president and seven times as a senator from Delaware.

""Nothing even vaguely Masonic would have been anywhere near these Bibles"" Robert Miller professor of biblical studies at The Catholic University of America said. ""Same thing for the 'Illuminati' to the extent that such a thing existed: repeatedly condemned by the Popes and certainly coming nowhere into contact with Catholic Bibles.""

Rev. Brent A. Strawn a professor of Old Testament and law at Duke University said there's ""no conspiracy"" behind the Bible. He explained the Douay-Rheims Bible is a translation of the Vulgate a Latin translation of the Hebrew Old Testament and Greek New Testament.

""Douay-Rheims is simply an English translation of the Latin Bible so popular in Catholic piety and worship"" he said.

No Biden did not instruct ICE to release all detained immigrants

CLAIM: A new order from the Biden administration directed Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to release all detained immigrants immediately.

THE FACTS: The Biden administration didn't order all immigrants to be released from ICE custody.

The false claim is based on an email issued by a local ICE officer in Houston to agents leaked to Fox News and taken out of context. The email begins ""I am just the messenger..."" and instructs agents in that office to ""stop all removals.""

One line reads ""Release them all immediately. No sponsor available is not acceptable any longer."" The email signature shows the author of the email holds the rank of assistant officer in charge for the Houston ICE field office.

Social media users and conservative websites cited the leaked email to spread the false claim the Biden administration's various immigration reforms had included immediate mass releases of detained immigrants. ""Joe Biden Orders ICE Agents to Release All Illegal Aliens in Custody"" read the headline of one article that was widely shared on Facebook.

Biden's Department of Homeland Security did issue a memo Jan. 20 establishong enforcement priorities and paused deportations of certain noncitizens who already had a final order of removal. But that directive which was temporarily blocked by a federal judge in Texas on Tuesday didn't include an order to release all immigrants from detention.

A statement issued by ICE shared Tuesday confirms the agency isn't under orders to free everyone in its custody. ""U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) continues to make custody determinations on a case by case basis in accordance with U.S. law and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) policy"" reads the statement.

""During the course of routine operations individuals can be released from custody based on the facts and circumstances of their cases.""

Furthermore a review of the email thread from the Houston ICE office revealed the email in question was retracted a day later only applied to a certain cohort of detainees and was issued in response to a federal court order -- not a directive from Biden's administration.

The emails became available to the public as part of a lawsuit the state of Texas filed against the Biden administration over its deportation moratorium. The email thread which redacts email addresses and names shows after the first email was sent late Thursday morning it was reversed Friday afternoon by an email that read ""Retract this directive immediately.""

That second email was signed ""FOD"" which is likely a reference to the field office director the highest ranking position in the Houston office. Another email in the chain clarifies the initial email was not instructing agents to release all immigrants but rather ""High risk detainees"" with health issues who had to be evaluated for release under an ongoing federal lawsuit.

In that legal case a federal judge in California had previously ordered ICE to individually review detainees and identify those who were at high risk of serious illness or death from covid-19 and prioritize their release.

""ICE does have the obligation to affirmatively review anyone in their custody with risk factors"" said Elizabeth Jordan an attorney with Civil Rights Education and Enforcement Center which represents immigrant detainees in that lawsuit.

WHO did not say covid-19 test led to case numbers being overstated

CLAIM: The World Health Organization admits that PCR tests to diagnose covid-19 gave massive false positives overinflating covid-19 case numbers.

THE FACTS: A WHO press release is being misrepresented online to say it shows that polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for covid-19 caused large scale false positives. Since the outset of the pandemic some social media users have been falsely suggesting false positive test results are the real reason behind the millions of reported covid-19 cases.

The latest posts are misrepresenting a WHO information notice. In widely shared posts on Facebook and Twitter social media users claim the WHO admitted PCR tests were causing false positives.

Kelly Wroblewski director of infectious disease at the Association of Public Health Laboratories said people are confusing infectiousness with what they think are false positives. The PCR test can determine when someone is at the beginning of the virus or at the tail end of it. ""The PCR test doesn't find something that is not there the virus is there"" she said.

The PCR test is generally a more sensitive test compared to rapid antigen tests which identify proteins from the virus. The WHO released an informational notice to lab technicians Dec. 14 clarifying instructions about analyzing PCR tests for covid-19.

WHO then updated the news release and published it Jan. 20. The January release spread online with claims it revealed a failure by the WHO. ""Wait. So there were too many false positives because the PCR tests were set at too high a threshold?"" one Facebook post said. ""Man I hadn't heard that anywhere -- except about 5 million times from reputable doctors who were conveniently silenced by the media for the past 10 months.""

But the WHO made no such admission nor did the health agency see a large scale number of false positives. The supposedly ""massive"" false positives being mentioned in the post were in fact much rarer. WHO told The Associated Press it has received 10 reports of problems related to PCR tests for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. ""The reports were for misdiagnosis both false positive and false negative results"" according to WHO.

""After thorough investigation WHO confirmed that tests were not always being used appropriately and in accordance with the instructions provided by the manufacturer.""

The release emphasized the importance of knowing the details about the patient the number of cycles of testing done when analyzing the specimen provided as well as the patient's clinical history. PCR tests work by analyzing the viral load in cycles.

Dr. Wafaa El-Sadr a professor of epidemiology and medicine at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health said the higher the viral load in a patient the easier it is for a PCR test to become positive. More cycles of the test are needed to detect infections with a lower viral load such as at the start or end of having the virus.

CLAIM: Donald Trump invited National Guard members to stay at the Trump Hotel in Washington so they didn't have to sleep in a cold parking garage.

THE FACTS: A spokesperson with the National Guard Bureau said they received no offers to stay at Trump International Hotel Washington the former president's hotel.

After National Guard troops came to Washington to secure President Joe Biden's the inauguration they were temporarily assigned to take rest breaks in a parking garage. Images of the guard members camping on the garage floor Jan. 21 sparked widespread outrage as well as misinformation online.

""President Trump said he is opening his entire Trump Hotel in Washington DC to the National Guard troops whom President Biden and the Democrats literally kicked to the curb having sent them to bed down in the unheated Capitol parking garage with no food and only one toilet for 1000s of men. God bless President Trump!!!"" read one popular Facebook post.

""Most media won't tell you that TRUMP HAS OFFERED THE NATIONAL GUARD STILL REMAINING IN D.C. to stay at his hotel rather than sleep on the garage cold floor"" another Facebook post stated.

But guard officials say the troops already had hotel rooms and no such offer from Trump was ever communicated. ""We have not received any offers at the National Guard Bureau"" Maj. Matt Murphy media relations officer at the bureau said.

A spokesperson at Trump International Hotel in Washington declined to comment. Capt. Chelsi Johnson a spokesperson for the D.C. National Guard said all troops participating in the mission had hotel rooms to go back to at the end of their shifts.

Some photos circulated online that appeared to show some troops inside the Trump Hotel though the photos were first posted before claims Trump had offered his hotel to them. ""For this mission we are not lodging any National Guard troops at the Trump Hotel"" Johnson said. ""National Guard troops can rest in between their shifts at a location of their choosing.""

In a briefing on Monday Army Maj. Gen. William J. Walker said guard members photographed in the garage Jan. 21 were taking rest breaks. ""Nobody slept there. Nobody spent the night there"" Walker said.

At the same briefing he said ""You stand 12 hours on your feet you want to take a break."" The AP reported the National Guard said it originally moved troops out of the Capitol Rotunda and other spaces to rest in garages at the behest of the Capitol Police.

The National Guard and Capitol Police issued a joint statement Jan. 22 saying they coordinated to establish ""appropriate spaces"" within congressional buildings for on-duty breaks.

Bill Gates did not say '3 billion people need to die'

CLAIM: Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates wants to eliminate at least 3 billion people in the world starting in Africa in a plot involving vaccines.

THE FACTS: A 2019 video falsely claiming Gates wants to depopulate the globe is circulating online anew this month as covid-19 vaccines become more widely available in the United States and elsewhere.

Instagram and Twitter posts containing the video made the further unsubstantiated claim that Gates wanted to use mandatory vaccines as part of his plan to eliminate billions of people.

The video shows naturopath Robert O. Young who uses natural remedies in healing speaking on a panel for the International Tribunal for Natural Justice an independent U.K.-based group that holds ""hearings"" and ""trials"" and whose members have promoted baseless conspiracy theories about 5G technology and the coronavirus.

Young who has previously been convicted for practicing medicine without a license and was ordered to pay $105 million to a woman who said he advised her against traditional cancer treatment claimed without evidence Gates planned to kill billions of people starting in Africa.

""In the words of Bill Gates at least 3 billion people need to die"" Young said. ""So we'll just start off in Africa we'll start doing our research there and we'll eliminate most of the Africans because they're deplorable. They're worthless. They're not part of this world economy.""

A review of public statements by Gates found nothing matching these claims. Young's statement appeared to misrepresent comments Gates made during a TED Talk in 2010 when he said vaccines and improved health care could help reduce the rate of global population growth and as a result lower carbon emissions.

""The world today has 6.8 billion people"" Gates said during the talk. ""That's headed up to about 9 billion. Now if we do a really great job on new vaccines health care reproductive health services we lower that by perhaps 10 or 15%."" Gates was talking about reducing the rate of population growth not the population by 10 or 15%.

In past interviews Gates has argued improving vaccines and health care can paradoxically slow the rate of population growth in poor countries because it lowers the child mortality rate. With more children making it to adulthood Gates has said parents may choose to have a smaller family size.

""Amazingly as children survive parents feel like they'll have enough kids to support them in their old age so they choose to have less children"" Gates said in a 2012. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the International Tribunal for Natural Justice didn't respond to requests for comment.

Biden cancellation of Keystone XL pipeline was not a favor to Warren Buffet

CLAIM: Billionaire Warren Buffett donated $58 million to President Joe Biden's campaign so Biden canceled the Keystone XL pipeline as a favor to Buffett.

THE FACTS: Buffett chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway didn't donate to Biden's presidential campaign nor did he endorse him. Buffett previously has voiced public support for the Keystone XL pipeline.

On Biden's first day in office he canceled the permit for construction of the Keystone XL pipeline saying it wasn't consistent with the administration's ""economic and climate imperatives.""

The 1700-mile pipeline was planned to carry roughly 800000 barrels of oil a day from Alberta to the Texas Gulf Coast. A Facebook post shared more than 60000 times suggests Biden halted the pipeline not for environmental reasons but as a favor to Buffett.

But the post's main thesis that the billionaire investor was a major donor to Biden's campaign is not true. ""Warren Buffet owns the railroad that is now transporting all that oil. Warren Buffet donated 58 million to Biden campaign. Warren Buffet would lose billions in transport fees if the pipeline is completed. See how politics works? It is not an environmental issue it is a money issue..."" the Facebook post reads.

In fact there is no record Buffett gave any money to Biden's 2020 presidential bid and Buffett's assistant Debbie Bosanek confirmed he did not. Federal Election Commission records show Buffett made no individual contributions in 2020.

In 2019 he gave $248500 to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee which supports Democratic House candidates and $5800 to Democratic Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly's campaign. In 2018 he gave $33900 to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee $33900 to the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee and $2700 each to the campaigns of Democrats Donna Shalala and Rufus Gifford.

Bosanek tsaid the 90-year-old billionaire didn't make other donations through a political action committee in the 2020 campaign cycle. Nor did Buffett campaign in favor of the current president.

""Mr. Buffett did not endorse Mr. Biden but both he and his wife voted for Mr. Biden"" Bosanek said.

It is true Buffett's company Berkshire Hathaway owns BNSF Railway a freight railroad network that transports crude oil. While analysts over the years have suggested the Keystone XL pipeline would take business from BNSF Buffett voiced his support for the project in a CNBC television appearance in 2014. ""It's not that big of a competitor"" Buffett said. ""I think probably the Keystone pipeline is a good idea for the country.""

Bosanek said Buffett hadn't offered any opinions about the project more recently that he can remember nor did he have a stance on how it would impact his business. ""Mr. Buffett has never seen any report by BNSF projecting whether the Keystone Pipeline would increase or decrease the revenue of the railroad"" Bosanek wrote.

He's also not enamored of the trend for contests and TV shows about the chase for investments. He doubts that the founders of Minnesota's biggest companies such as Best Buy's Richard Schulze or UnitedHealth's Richard Burke would have won any of them.

""There was nothing unique about their ideas"" Rao said. ""Their genius was in their strategy and skills to execute their strategy. And they just happened to build some of Minnesota's greatest companies.""

Rao notes that the founders of Google Apple and Microsoft avoided or were refused venture capital for years. They waited until they were large and powerful enough to control their own destiny.

Minnesota has had some VC-fueled winners over the last 20 years. However most were purchased by other companies before they became the $1 billion revenue-and-market value ""unicorns"" such as United Health Medtronic and Best Buy that Rao contends is the spine of a strong economy.

Rao an engineer and Ph.D. in finance taught at Harvard the University of Minnesota and most recently at Florida International University. He worked 20-plus years in venture finance and economic development in Milwaukee.

In 2009 Rao wrote ""Bootstrap to Billions."" Last year: ""Finance Secrets of Billion-Dollar Entrepreneurs."" In it Rao interviewed and analyzed the work and skills of Burke Schulze Medtronic founder Earl Bakken Fastenal founder Bob Kierlin and others.

""These are the unicorn billion-dollar entrepreneurs … who [bootstrap-and-borrowed] from startup to more than $1 billion in sales and valuation … among the world's most successful entrepreneurs"" he said.

Rao criticizes the motivation for VCs to gain disproportionate control and wealth for themselves and their investors which leads them to drive companies to go public or sell to bigger firms.

And he explains the business-finance strategies that kept the successful founders in control; from friendly individual investors to various forms of debt finance partnerships and capital-conservation strategies.

Rao said VCs fail to make money on eight of 10 ventures. So they need big success from the other two something like 300%-plus returns to produce aggregate returns that surpass what investors can make in the stock market.

VCs generally invest after a startup company's potential is evident he said. Entrepreneurs need to stay independent longer in search of greater long-term results downstream. That can be tough to do when VCs and investment bankers are dangling millions your way.

Jeff Hinck managing director of Rally Ventures which has offices in the Twin Cities and Silicon Valley presents the counterargument. He said last year's 42% jump in VC investment in the state is great news for entrepreneurs of all stripes.

""VC-backed companies have been a driver of startup activity and job growth in Minnesota for decades"" he said. ""Current and former Rally Ventures portfolio companies such as Compellent SportsEngine Total Expert and others have created thousands of net new jobs in Minnesota. Former employees have created thousands more via new startups.

""There are also a number of current $1 billion-plus [market value] VC-backed companies headquartered here. Jamf Protolabs SPS Commerce and Sezzle to name a few. And companies that are sold generate executives and employees who know what it takes for a business to succeed. They pass on knowledge which creates a more successful startup and economic ecosystem.""

A local venture capitalist recently praised the University of Minnesota-sponsored Minnesota Cup sweepstakes that is the largest pitch competition in the country.

The U's business school since 2006 helped launch 165-plus startups which have attracted $1.15 billion in capital. Seven went public since 2017.

Rao is watching. A grateful immigrant Rao said he is an admirer of Mahatma Gandhi the nonviolent father of Indian independence 70 years ago.

""The only reason [I'm] here and doing well is because of Gandhi"" said Rao. ""Independent India focused on education and developing its youth with world-class institutions.""

Rao's book is a finalist for the Eric Hoffer Award a prestigious competition named after the American philosopher for books published by academic and independent presses. Rao has aided our economy and sparked healthy debate.

If you’re in a hurry you can skip ahead and read the 5 Best European Dividend Stocks to Buy Now.

Most of us know Europe to be the first major world region to develop a modern economy based on agriculture and industrial development. According to the European Commission the EU has ""the largest economy in the world with a gross domestic product (GDP) per head of €25 000 for its 500 million consumers"". They are the top trading partner for 80 countries. In an article we mentioned the 11 Most Livable Countries in Europe. Europe has a large economy but it isn't the largest economy in the world. That title still belongs to the United States and probably China will become the largest economy in about 10 years or so. Nevertheless Europe is a better hunting ground for investors looking for stable and reliable companies to invest in.

The COVID-19 pandemic has taken a toll on many countries. Imposed lockdown and social distancing has left many economic collapses and Europe was not immune to this. The International Monetary Fund forecasts suggest that the aggregate Eurozone public deficit will hit a record level of 10.1% of GDP in 2020 with debt rising above the 100% of GDP threshold for the first time ever to 101.1%. According to Deloitte Spain took the strongest hit with its GDP shrinking 18%.

Despite the economic downfall the European economy is slowly recovering from the trauma of the pandemic. Based on a report published in DW during July August and September as the rate of infections dropped and the authorities loosened lockdowns and travel restrictions. During those three months the GDP grew by 12.7% this was the largest increase since records started in 1995. According to the European Commission the economy is not expected to go back to its pre-pandemic level” before 2023.

After four years of what many viewed as President Trump’s irrationally abrasive treatment of Germany as a key US ally European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen was excited to speak of a “renewed partnership” with newly elected US President Biden. “Once again after four long years Europe has a friend in the White House” she said. Not only was it exciting news for the European commission president but also for Italy’s prime minister Giuseppe Conte where he focused on the future

“We are looking forward to the Biden presidency with which we will start working immediately in view of our presidency of the G-20. We have a strong common agenda ranging from the effective multilateralism that we both want to see to climate change green and digital transition and social inclusion.”

We think European dividend stocks may offer higher capital gains potential than the US dividend stocks because some European stock markets like UK and Spain trade at less than half of the United States' 10-year CAPE ratio. ""We’re actually at a very interesting time in markets whereby I think non-U.S. markets over probably the next six months to nine months will outperform the U.S.” Quilvest Wealth Management's Bob Parker told CNBC in a recent interview. Parker expects European stocks to beat the US stocks and he is especially bullish on Spain U.K. and Italy.

In order to create the list of the best European dividend stocks to buy now we considered European dividend stocks that trade in the U.S. exchanges and ranked them using our hedge fund sentiment data. Our in-house research showed that by using the hedge fund sentiment data we can identify a small group of stocks that can outperform the S&P 500 index on average by double digits annually. For instance the portfolio for stock picks for our monthly newsletter has beaten the market by over 88 percentage points since March 2017 (see details here). Some of the portfolio choices for our monthly newsletter were also publicly shared on our website. In October we posted this real estate stock and since then it’s been up more than 50 percent.

Based on our hedge fund sentiment data we present to you the 14 best European dividend stocks to buy now among 800+ hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey:

14. Unilever Plc (NYSE:UL)

No of HFs: 13

Total Value of HF Holdings: $159 Million

At the end of September a total of 13 of the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were long this stock a change of 0% from the previous quarter. UL's current shares are $58 and offer a dividend yield of 3.95%. The stock was mentioned as one of the 10 Best Food Stocks to Buy Now. In an article Lindsell Train mentioned that UL’s e-commerce revenues were up 76% year-on-year.

“One of the biggest holdings here includes Unilever. The way consumers have flocked to such brands in 2020 perhaps for reassurance has been reassuring for the investors. In Unilever’s most recent quarterly results the company reported its e-commerce revenues were up 76% year-on-year up to 10% of the total. This does not mean that Unilever is turning into Internet business but it does give reassurance that its brands – from Ben & Jerry’s to Domestos – can remain relevant in an increasingly digital world. By the way – have you tried Unilever’s new Marmite-infused peanut butter? It’s divine.”

13. SAP SE (NYSE:SAP)

No of HFs: 16

Total Value of HF Holdings: $1.80 Billion

Heading into the fourth quarter of 2020 a total of 16 of the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey held long positions in this stock unchanged from a quarter earlier. SAP currently trade at $126 and offer a dividend yield of 1.37%. Polen Capital Management mentioned a few of their comments on SAP in their Q2 2020 investor letter

“SAP on the other hand will likely be less affected in the near term by the COVID-19 shutdowns in our view. While it certainly will be impacted as countries around the world face GDP declines Enterprise Resource Planning software is mission-critical and we think the company’s cloud offerings will continue to benefit from its S/4 upgrade cycle. Despite SAP’s strength recurring revenue and durability it was trading at about 20x forward earnings. While we do not focus on macroeconomics or speculate on related market movements member states across Europe were unable to execute a coordinated effort to provide liquidity as quickly as the U.S. or other countries. We suspect the absence of a swift and unified response is at least partially responsible for most European indices being negative 20-30% in early May while the S&P 500 was only down 10%. Regardless of the cause we think SAP is reasonably valued for such a strong and resilient growth business. While a less robust policy response could mean that it takes longer for growth to recover in Europe SAP earns almost 70% of its revenues from outside of the continent.”

12. Anheuser Bush Inbev NV (NYSE:BUD)

No of HFs: 18

Total Value of HF Holdings: $958 Million

BUD ranks 12th in our list of the best European dividend stocks to buy now. The stock was mentioned as one of the 10 Best Beverage Stocks to Buy Now and 15 Largest Beer Companies in the World in 2020. BUD shares offer a dividend yield of 2.32%. Broyhill Asset Management mentioned BUD in a recent investor letter:

“We also diversified our beer exposure during the quarter adding a direct investment in Ambev (ABEV) to compliment our existing investment in Anheuser Busch Inbev (BUD). As the current environment has punished highly leveraged businesses like BUD (despite the company’s ability to generate strong and recurring cash flow) the opportunity to own ABEV with net cash on its balance sheet and the highest returns on capital in the industry—at a lower multiple than its parent—was too good to pass up. Together these names represent roughly 20% of our capital today. Given their cheap valuations combined with the fact that beer and tobacco consumption has historically increased during recession one could argue that we should have even more exposure to these Sin Stocks. In principle we agree and given the opportunity we’d be happy to increase our positions. But in the interim we are highly sensitive to maintaining balance in the portfolio. At one end we own high quality defensive businesses that should fare well in almost any environment. At the other end we’ve begun building a portfolio of more cyclical businesses positioned to rebound sharply and gain share once the clouds clear. We discuss a few of these investments below.”

11. Diageo Plc (NYSE:DEO)

No of HFs: 19

Total Value of HF Holdings: $466 Million

DEO shares currently trade at $160 and offer a dividend yield of 2.22%. They are known to be one of the world’s largest producers of spirits and beers. In 2020 the company announced some changes to their finance leadership team Kathryn Mikells Chief Financial Officer Diageo commented:

""I am delighted Vinod will take on the combined role of Group Treasurer and Head of Global Audit and Risk. Vinod brings a wealth of operational market and global experience to this new role and I would like to thank him for his strong leadership of investor relations. Lavanya’s presence in North America will enable us to continue to build on this platform. I wish them both every success in their new roles.’

10. Sanofi SA (NASDAQ:SNY)

No of HFs: 20

Total Value of HF Holdings: $1.24 Billion

SNY ranks 10th in our list of the best European dividend stocks to buy now. SNY shares are currently at $47 and offer a dividend yield of 3.60%. Generation PMCA talked about the stock in its 2020 Q3 investor letter:

“Sanofi the French pharmaceutical company is one of the largest drug companies globally. Last year Sanofi unveiled its “Play to Win” strategy focused on reigniting growth accelerating R&D and improving profitability via operating efficiencies. A cornerstone of this new strategy is Dupixent the first biologic approved to treat patients with atopic dermatitis whose disease cannot be controlled with a topical prescription. In Q3 Dupixent reached €1 billion in revenue. The company believes this drug can ultimately generate over €10 billion of annual revenue. Over the next 5 years we see Sanofi’s vaccine business growing mid-to-high digits on the launch of key influenza and PPH vaccines. As with Bristol Myers the main risk relates to drug development. We are comfortable with its robust pipeline with over 6 major therapeutics in development and expect further growth from acquisitions. Our FMV estimate is €105 and the stock yields 3.7% while we wait for the share price to appreciate.”

9. Vodafone Group Plc (NASDAQ:VOD)

No of HFs: 22

Total Value of HF Holdings: $677 Million

VOD ranks 9th in our list of the best European dividend stocks to buy now. VOD shares currently trade at $17 and offer a dividend yield of 9.09%.

No of HFs: 30

Total Value of HF Holdings: $611 Million

BP shares currently change hands for $22 and offer a dividend yield of 5.67%. The company is one of the 15 Largest Energy Companies in the World. In an article Broyhill Asset Management mentioned that BP is one of the largest best managed and well-capitalized companies in the industry.

“As if a global pandemic wasn’t enough during the quarter OPEC and Russia decided to add an oil crisis to the list of things for investors to panic about. After oil’s largest one-day decline in history we established a small position in Exxon Mobile (XOM) and British Petroleum (BP)—two of the largest best managed and well capitalized companies in the industry. We don’t have a short-term view on oil but we do know that the best cure for low oil prices is low oil prices. And with the sector trading at its lowest level relative to the market in history we are willing to bet that the current extremes in negative sentiment willrevert to more normal levels—and more normal oil prices—at some point. In the interim we are being paid 10% annually to wait.”

Today's best AMD Ryzen 7 5800X and deals $449 $175 View Deal ends Sun May 12 2024 $599.99 $205 View $449 $225 View Show More Deals

AMD's Ryzen 7 5800X slots into AMD's Zen 3-powered product stack with eight cores and sixteen threads serving as the mainstream workhorse of the Ryzen 5000 series processors that have taken our list of Best CPUs by storm and realigned our CPU Benchmarks Hierarchy. Powered by the Zen 3 architecture that delivers a ~19% increase in instruction per cycle (IPC) throughput the Ryzen 7 5800X delivers the impressive gains over the previous-gen models that we've come to expect resetting our performance expectations for an eight-core processor.

However balancing a product stack is all about selecting the right price point for any given chip and the Ryzen 7 5800X's relatively high price point ($50 more than the previous-gen model) not only puts it into contention with bruising competition from within AMD's own product stack it also allows Intel's $374 Core i7-10700K to slot in as a value alternative.

The $449 Ryzen 7 5800X is the next step up the ladder from the $299 six-core 12-thread Ryzen 5 5600X the best gaming CPU for the money but the 5800X provides roughly the same gaming performance for $150 more. AMD also stopped bundling air coolers with its chips with a TDP rating that exceeds 65W so the 105W Ryzen 7 5800X comes without what used to be one of AMD's most prized value-adds for the Ryzen 7 series – the Wraith Prism RGB cooler.

AMD's cooler-less Ryzen 5000 series models require a 280mm AIO cooler (or equivalent air cooler) adding plenty of cost into the equation. That will likely dissuade gaming-focused enthusiasts from dropping the extra cash for the 5800X's two additional cores that don't deliver meaningful gaming performance gains over the Ryzen 5 5600X.

Conversely the $549 Ryzen 9 5900X is an alluring chip for the productivity-minded. The 5900X comes armed with 12 cores and 24 threads for $100 more than the 5800X and the extra four cores and eight threads equate to ~37% more performance in threaded workloads for 22% more cash. The Ryzen 9 5900X is also the fastest gaming chip in the Zen-3 powered stack so there aren't any tradeoffs from moving up to the competitively-priced 12-core model.

Intel's $440 Core i9-10850K comes into the picture with ten cores and 20 threads. This chip serves as the gaming equivalent to the $490 Core i9-10900K and is $10 cheaper than the Ryzen 7 5800X. The aging Skylake microarchitecture doesn't have enough gas left in the tank to match the Ryzen 7 5800X's stellar performance in gaming or lightly-threaded work but it does offer roughly 3% more performance in threaded performance. Given its other deficiencies we don't see Core i9's extra threaded horsepower wooing away many Ryzen 7 5800X shoppers.

AMD's Zen 3 suffers from a noticeable gap in its product stack: Based upon product naming alone it appears there is a missing Ryzen 7 5700X to plug the $150 hole in the stack but we aren't sure if AMD will actually bring a 5700X to market. For now that gap allows the $374 Core i7-10700K to weigh in as a cheaper alternative to the 5800X but you'll make plenty of tradeoffs for the lower price point. Given the 10700K's low price point it makes a solid value alternative - just be aware that you'll sacrifice performance.

AMD's premium could be a disadvantage if Intel becomes more aggressive on pricing but AMD's suggested selling prices rarely manifest at retail and continuing shortages have found Ryzen 5000 chips selling far over recommended pricing. History indicates that given sufficient supply AMD's processors typically retail for far less than the official price points. That makes it hard to predict how pricing will shake out over the next months as supply normalizes.

Meanwhile Intel's response won't come until the first quarter of 2021 when its Rocket Lake chips blast off. These new chips bring a back-ported Cypress Cove architecture that grants a “double-digit” IPC increase paired with Intel's never-ending line of 14nm chips. Early indicators point to these chips flaunting their own impressive gains in per-core performance.

Intel's Rocket Lake tops out at eight cores so while those chips won't be able to challenge AMD's core-heavy Ryzen 9 processors they could be worthy rivals for AMD's Ryzen 7 and 5 models. For now Zen 3 has caught Intel flat-footed with its Comet Lake chips so you should only consider them as alternatives if they're retailing below the official MSRPs.

Ryzen 7 5800X Specifications and Pricing

The Ryzen 5000 series processors come as four models that span from six cores and twelve threads up to 16 cores and 32 threads. With the exception of the Ryzen 7 5800X AMD increased its Precision Boost clock rates across the board. However the Ryzen 7 5800X has the same 4.7 GHz boost clock as its predecessor the Ryzen 7 3800XT.

As before AMD only guarantees its boost frequencies on a single core and all-core boosts will vary based on the cooling solution power delivery and motherboard firmware. Given sufficient accommodations the chips could exceed their specified boost clocks - our Ryzen 7 5800X sample frequently boosted to 4.85 GHz on a single core which is well above the rated 4.7 GHz boost. It's clear that AMD has spec'd the Ryzen 5000 processors conservatively.

AMD also reduced Zen 3's base frequencies compared to the previous-gen processors. For instance the Ryzen 7 5800X comes with a 3.8 GHz base frequency compared to the previous-gen 3800XT's 3.9 GHz but in practice that isn't a meaningful distinction. AMD says that if you top the chip with an adequate cooler it will rarely (if ever) drop to the base frequency. We recorded many cases of a 4.5 GHz all-core boost with the Ryzen 7 5800X which certainly wasn't possible with the previous-gen chips. We'll cover that more in-depth below.

TDP L3 Cache Ryzen 9 5950X $799 16 / 32 3.4 / 4.9 GHz 105W 64MB (2x32) Ryzen 9 5900X $549 12 / 24 3.7 / 4.8 GHz 105W 64MB (2x32) Ryzen 7 5800X $449 8 / 16 3.8 / 4.7 GHz 105W 32MB (1x32) Ryzen 5 5600X $299 6 / 12 3.7 / 4.6 GHz 65W 32MB (1x32)

The Ryzen chips continue to expose 20 lanes of PCIe 4.0 to the user and stick with DDR4-3200 memory as the base spec. However if the silicon lottery shines upon you we found that the chips offer much better memory overclocking due to improved fabric overclocking capabilities. We achieved DDR4-3800 with a 1:1 memory/fabric clock ratio which wasn't possible with the previous-gen Ryzen 7 3800XT but still short of the DDR4-4000 we achieved with the Ryzen 9 5900X. Overall the 500-series motherboard firmwares are mature but there is continuing development on the memory and fabric overclocking front. That means we could see further improvements here with newer BIOS updates.

The Ryzen 5000 chips drop into existing AM4 motherboards with 500-series chipsets like X570 B550 and A520 models. AMD is adding support for 400-series motherboards starting in Q1 2021 but that comes with a few restrictions. Regardless some motherboard vendors have jumped ahead and already offer support on 400-series motherboards so that initiative is well underway. Just remember that you'll lose support for the PCIe 4.0 interface on those older motherboards.

We've covered AMD's Zen 3 microarchitecture more in-depth in our Ryzen 9 5950X and 5900X review. The highlight reel is that AMD has unified its L3 cache into one 32MB contiguous cluster which vastly reduces memory latency thus boosting performance in latency-sensitive workloads like gaming. AMD also made a number of fine-grained optimizations to the microarchitecture.

AMD leverages its existing Ryzen SoC for the 5000 series chips. Zen 3 uses the same 12nm I/O Die (IOD) paired with either one or two 8-core chiplets (CCD) in an MCM (Multi-Chip Module) configuration. For the Ryzen 7 5800X the chip comes with one CCD with all eight cores enabled while CPUs with 12 or 16 cores come with two chiplets.

The IOD still contains the same memory controllers PCIe and other interfaces that connect the SoC to the outside world. Just like with the Matisse chips the IOD measures ~125mm^2 and has 2.09 billion transistors.

The chiplets have been redesigned however and now measure ~80.7mm^2 and have 4.15 billion transistors. That's slightly larger than Zen 2's CCDs with ~74mm^2 of silicon and 3.9 billion transistors. For more details of the magic behind the 19% increase in IPC head here.

The chart above illustrates how dynamically holding growth and mega caps (the “anti-factors” to value and small size) was preferred over their factor complements in recent years due to their relative dominance in disruptive innovation alongside robust profitability. We can maintain a well-balanced portfolio by also holding positions in momentum quality and minimum volatility to capture exposure to historically rewarded factors.

Expanding the opportunity set in dynamic factor frameworks to include other investment styles or “anti-factors” during periods of cyclical strength has the potential to unlock additional benefits for portfolios and can help mitigate short-term weakness in traditional factors while still maintaining diversification.

Factors with themes

Themes like the predominant work-from-home influences that occurred in 2020 are transitory but they interact with factors in significant ways. Over 2020 much of the US workforce went into work-from-home and many in-person work and leisure activities were curtailed. Value suffered as social distancing themes went into effect—because often value stocks were overweight business models that needed a physical presence like foot traffic in a store or in-person office interactions to generate business. Many growth companies particularly tech services firms with dominant market positions benefited from the rise of connectivity technology. Social distancing also benefited large stocks with large financial cushions. During the worst months of February and March minimum volatility outperformed the market by 4-6%.2

But the pattern for minimum volatility reversed as the economy gradually re-opened over the last half of 2020. From the bottom of the market in late March the market shot up powered by large growth stocks like the FAANGMs (Facebook Apple Amazon Netflix Google or Alphabet and Microsoft) and tech services firms that benefit most from the social distancing and work from home environment of 2020. As market participants’ risk aversion decreased strategies that minimized risk like minimum volatility strategies tended to lag. On the other hand despite their overall disappointing performance in 2020 value and size outperformed the market in Q4 by 5.4% and 5.9% respectively as the economy reopened and in person business resumed.3 The toggling between social-distance themes benefiting growth stocks and economic reopening benefiting value and size over the course of the global pandemic is more fully illustrated in the chart below.

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink/AFP



Lisa Van Dusen

January 30 2021

In his 2020 annual Letter to CEOs — or “Larry’s Letter” — last January BlackRock co-founder and CEO Larry Fink advised that “The evidence on climate risk is compelling investors to reassess core assumptions about modern finance” and that his firm would henceforth avoid investments in companies that “present a high sustainability-related risk.”

In case anyone missed last year’s message or presumed it would be nuanced or amended by the economic exigencies of the COVID-19 lockdown this year’s Larry’s Letter published January 26 doubled down on climate change mitigation as the new pork bellies and compelled companies toward a net-zero agenda. “Climate transition presents a historic investment opportunity” Fink writes of his zealotry on the attractions of “ESG” — environmental social and governance — as a driver of profits.

Fink controls an investment fund worth nearly $9 trillion dollars making him per the New York Times’ Andrew Ross Sorkin “arguably the world’s most powerful investor” and an annual-letter investing Sherpa now greater in oracular parsing power than Warren Buffett and his yearly letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders.

The reality that Fink’s 2021 letter underscores is that the sustainable investing and corporate social responsibility movements that were sidetracked by the calamities of the 2008 financial meltdown have not only bounced back they have bounced back past the tipping point at which doing good means doing well beyond just the public branding dividend.

“Over the course of 2020 we have seen how purposeful companies with better environmental social and governance (ESG) profiles have outperformed their peers” Fink writes. “During 2020 81 percent of a globally-representative selection of sustainable indexes outperformed their parent benchmarks. This outperformance was even more pronounced during the first quarter downturn another instance of sustainable funds’ resilience that we have seen in prior downturns. And the broader array of sustainable investment options will continue to drive investor interest in these funds as we have seen in 2020.”

In other words to update the Gordon Gekko-ism that spawned a generation of pomaded day-traders “Green greed is good.”

This evolution in the global migration patterns of money marks such a significant shift that it is the subject of this weekend’s Financial Times Life & Arts section front by the paper’s US managing editor (Canadian Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland’s old job) and Moral Money columnist Gillian Tett titled Wall Street’s New Mantra: Green is Good.

In other words to update the Gordon Gekko-ism that spawned a generation of pomaded day-traders “Green greed is good.”

While Tett traces the Damascus-bound conversion of Fink and other .001 percent financiers to anecdotal moments of climate change-driven personal devaluation shocks such as elite wilderness fishing trips spoiled by depleted water levels decimated salmon stocks and wildfire smoke in a way that might make environmental activists roll their eyes that’s beside the point. “I am 68 years old and have seven grandchildren” Fink tells Tett. “I want to leave the planet better for them but I am not doing this for environmental reasons — I am a fiduciary responsible for other people’s money and climate change is affecting their investments.”

Yes there is always the chance that a shift driven by profit motive rather than principle will swerve into the same contagion of corruption that produced the 2008 mortgage-driven meltdown. Let’s not forget that that extravaganza of innovation in exotic financial instruments was partly cynically Trojan horsed as a breakthrough in minority home ownership. But as Fink former Bank of Canada and Bank of England Governor and current United Nations Envoy on Climate Action and Finance Mark Carney and others know the new Green Revolution happening on Wall Street won’t happen without a return on investment.

Joe Biden didn’t kill the Keystone XL pipeline reality did. The same combination of climate change-driven political and investment disincentives that made the project a chronic asymmetrical irritant during the Harper-Obama years and made its reinstatement just one among many of Donald Trump’s ludicrous reversals also made President Biden’s repeatedly explicitly telegraphed decision to revert to the pre-Trump status quo entirely unsurprising.

To continue to promise Alberta oil workers a counterfactual salvation belied by the critical mass of pragmatic change instead of investing in 21st-century jobs isn’t just disingenuous it’s political and economic malpractice.

Risk-reducing buffered ETFs that aim to take some of the danger out of investing in stock markets enjoyed a banner year in 2020 with a surge in the number of launches and assets under management.

However a push by a grouping of the exchange traded fund industry’s biggest players could potentially derail the fast-growing sector by stripping funds of their designation as ETFs.

Buffered or defined outcome ETFs provide investors with a degree of downside protection if the stock market falls. In return investors give up some of the potential gains only receiving the return of the underlying index up to a fixed preset cap if it rises over the contract period.

The most recent monthly edition of the Innovator S&P 500 Power Buffer ETF (PJAN) for example launched on January 2 protected investors against the first 15 per cent of any loss over the subsequent 12 months in return for any gains being capped at 9.75 per cent. The cap and protection change every time the ETF resets.

Buffered funds enjoyed a breakthrough year in 2020 with 65 launches (up from the previous record of 19 in 2019) accounting for more than 20 per cent of all ETF debuts in the US according to data from FactSet.

Early movers such as Innovator ETF First Trust Pacer and TrueShares have been joined by an insurance company arm — Allianz Investment Management — for the first time which has been managing similar strategies in an insurance wrapper for decades.

Total buffered ETF assets have surged from $300m to $5bn in the past 12 months according to Allianz.

John Southard co-founder and chief investment officer of Innovator Capital Management the early industry leader with about $3.5bn of assets in defined outcome ETFs said take-up was driven in part by extremely low bond yields.

Investors need to know with one click what type of instrument they are buying

“It’s for the investor who says ‘I want to stay invested in the market but I want some downside buffer in place. Maybe I’m late in my investing cycle. I’m withdrawing money from my retirement account so I can’t afford a big downdraft’” said Mr Southard who with Bruce Bond chief executive co-founded PowerShares which later became Invesco’s ETF arm.

Yet the tried and tested formula of a 60/40 portfolio of equities and bonds has become less attractive as “bond yields are so low people don’t want 40 per cent of their portfolio in something yielding 1-2 per cent so advisers are having to look for alternatives” said Mr Southard. Amid record high markets investors “scared” of a market crash are also potential buyers he said.

Johan Grahn vice-president portfolio management at Allianz IM said it had seen a “tremendous reception to the ETFs” since the rollout of its initial buffered fund in June heralded the German insurance company’s first-ever foray into ETFs.

“We have many decades of managing these strategies for the insurance side of the business” said Mr Grahn. “We manage $150bn of risk around the world and a lot of the underlying structures are the same as for the ETFs.

We don’t want to be unfairly put in a category that would create confusion . . . Just because we have options in our portfolios does not mean we have additional risk. In fact we are lower risk

“We are now taking some of that expertise that we have built up over time and building that into an ETF.”

Mr Grahn said defined outcome ETFs were “solving an age-old problem in a very elegant way” in that it allowed a “de-risking of equity exposure” and their arrival was “a function of the ETF market evolving”.

“The market really earned its spurs in 2020. These strategies held up really well in [the market sell-off] in March. That was a gift to the industry” said Mr Grahn whose ETFs have so far attracted $135m of assets.

So far buffered ETFs are only available in the US.

Mr Southard said Innovator had preliminary discussions about launching products in Europe but given the bank-dominated distribution model in parts of the continent had decided to focus on the US.

Thus far most products are based on US equity indices although Innovator has three further ETFs linked respectively to developed market equities ex-US emerging markets and US investment grade bonds.

Further growth could be slowed however if a grouping of the ETF industry’s most powerful players gets its way.

The asset managers have proposed that buffered ETFs should lose the “ETF” designation and instead be called exchange traded instruments a move that could slow their take-up in an investor community that has become familiar with the ETF label.

The consortium of BlackRock State Street Vanguard Charles Schwab Fidelity Investments and Invesco which between them control more than 90 per cent of the US ETF market wrote to US regulators last year calling for “clearer identification and categorisation of exchange traded products”.

Specifically it argued that “certain ETPs with complex structures and/or certain embedded risks” should be categorised as exchange traded notes (ETNs) commodities (ETCs) or instruments (ETIs) rather than as ETFs.

“Investors need to know with one click what type of instrument they are buying” said Anna Paglia global head of ETFs and indexed strategies at Invesco.

“ETFs were created as plain vanilla types of vehicles to get exposure to market returns but the market has evolved dramatically. Right now we have a variety of instruments that go by the name ETFs.”

However buffered ETF providers are unhappy that under the proposals the vehicles would be rebranded as ETIs alongside leveraged and inverse ETFs which use derivatives to increase risk rather than reduce it.

Mr Grahn pointed out the products would be harder to market “if you have to put a different label on it and explain it”.

“We don’t want to be unfairly put in a category that would create confusion” said Mr Southard. “Just because we have options in our portfolios does not mean we have additional risk. In fact we are lower risk.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vY29ycGdvdi5sYXcuaGFydmFyZC5lZHUvMjAyMS8wMS8zMC9lc2ctYW5kLXN1c3RhaW5hYmlsaXR5LWtleS1jb25zaWRlcmF0aW9ucy1mb3ItMjAyMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ESG and Sustainability: Key Considerations for 2021,"Heading into 2021 corporate investor and stakeholder focus on ESG will continue to accelerate with climate change workplace diversity employee welfare human capital management and supply chain sustainability and resilience remaining forefront issues. Just earlier this week BlackRock’s Chairman and CEO issued a letter to CEOs calling on companies to (1) “disclose a plan for how their business model will be compatible with a net zero economy” including how such plans are incorporated into long-term strategy and reviewed by the board and (2) expand disclosures on talent strategy to fully reflect long-term plans to improve diversity equity and inclusion. The World Economic Forum (WEF) also announced this week that 61 of the world’s largest companies have committed to disclosing against the core ESG metrics developed by the WEF and its International Business Council a key further step in the ongoing convergence of ESG disclosures. Hedge fund TSR activist attacks will also increasingly leverage ESG and sustainability-related themes as will the new breed of ESG impact activist funds.

The fact that ESG-oriented funds recorded unprecedented inflows and outperformed in many respects in 2020 amidst the Covid-19 pandemic demonstrates the possibility of doing well by doing good. At the same time the pandemic exposed the significant social economic and reputational costs of not addressing ESG issues notably systemic racism employee safety health and well- being and supply chain resilience. Below is a review of the trends we expect to see in 2021 as investors and other stakeholders scrutinize how companies create and preserve long-term value:

Heightened Focus on Climate Change Risks

ESG Goal Setting and Accountability

Workplace Diversity Under Scrutiny

Reshaping of Human Capital Management

Supply Chain Sustainability and Resilience

New Expectations for “Active” Board Oversight

Accelerating Disclosure and Moving to Assurance and Integration

Heightened Focus on Climate Change Risks. In November 2021 global leaders will meet in Glasgow for the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) to draw up a successor plan to the Paris Agreement. With evidence indicating that the Paris Agreement targets may fall short of limiting global warming to 1.5°C governments and regulators globally face mounting public pressure to address the threat of climate change. President Biden has already issued an executive order for the United States to re-join the Paris Agreement and key investors have made climate change risk management a key priority for 2021: BlackRock has stated in its 2021 stewardship expectations guidelines that “[t]he events of [2020] have intensified our conviction that sustainability risk—and climate risk in particular—is investment risk” and plans to expand its engagement to the over 1000 companies that are responsible for producing 90% of greenhouse gas emissions in its investment portfolio. Similarly in his letter to boards (discussed on the Forum here) Cyrus Taraporevala State Street’s CEO and President said the asset manager will be elevating its focus on climate risk noting that ahead of COP26 “policymakers are assessing progress on climate change action . . . many jurisdictions are signaling their intentions to make climate risk disclosure mandatory.” Vanguard has determined that “it is critical that public company boards fully understand and own climate-related risks.”

ESG Goal Setting and Accountability. While many current ESG disclosures are descriptive and historical we expect a move towards forward-looking ESG disclosures encompassing qualitative and quantitative targets that help demonstrate accountability commitment and progress towards ESG best practices. A growing number of companies have already publicly disclosed forward-looking initiatives on climate change and diversity. There is also an increasing push among investors for companies to provide disclosures consistent with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosure (TCFD) which include among other things disclosures regarding climate risk scenario planning and the adoption of targets to manage climate-related risks. In 2021 and beyond companies will need to consider how to formulate an ESG strategy whose progress can be measured by concrete reportable targets goals and forecasts and decide how best to publicly communicate initiatives that may extend across several decades and require flexibility to evolve and pivot over time.

Workplace Diversity Under Scrutiny. In 2021 it is likely that investor and stakeholder focus on racial and ethnic diversity will move beyond the board and into the broader workplace. The pandemic has exposed the rampant injustices created by systemic issues and the weight of the pandemic and job loss continues to be disproportionately borne by minorities and women even as people of all backgrounds are adversely affected. With respect to boards late last year Nasdaq filed a proposal with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to require listed companies to have or explain why they do not have at least two diverse directors and ISS Glass Lewis and many investors have amended their 2021 proxy voting guidelines to increase scrutiny of gender and racial diversity on boards. While board diversity will remain a key focus for investors and regulators the push for diversity is expanding to the workforce: investors including the New York City Comptroller BlackRock State Street and Vanguard along with ISS have all called on companies to disclose their workforce EEO-1 data or equivalent workforce demographic information. Vanguard also cautioned in a recent policy statement regarding hiring that “[c]ompanies that fail to include a wider array of individuals will miss out on large portions of the talent pool and put their long term success in jeopardy.” A number of financial institutions even recently announced Rooney Rule-style initiatives with respect to workforce recruitment and hiring.

Reshaping of Human Capital Management. The onset of remote work and the disruption stress and uncertainty created by the pandemic has helped to draw attention to and in many cases prompted companies to rethink their approach to human capital management in particular employee health and well-being. Investors are now looking at how companies are adapting their employee recruitment training development and retention practices corporate culture and corporate purpose to meet the needs of this new era. Late last year the SEC amended Regulation S-K to require disclosure of material human capital-related information in annual reports on Form 10-K. The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) is also currently reviewing the scope of human capital disclosures across its framework.

Supply Chain Sustainability and Resilience. The pandemic saw unprecedented disruptions to global supply chains and underscored the blind spots in supply chain models geared towards maximizing efficiency at the expense of resilience. In the meantime concern regarding sustainability supplier diversity and transparency are gaining traction among consumers as well as investors. Companies looking to rebuild and strengthen their supply chains will need not only to ensure compliance safety and reliability but also explore how their supply chains can play an integral role in the company’s efforts to promote sustainability equality and access.

New Expectations for “Active” Board Oversight. As investor and stakeholder scrutiny of ESG continues to accelerate boards will also continue to face heightened expectations on their oversight of ESG. Management of ESG risks and opportunities such as climate change will often require companies to adopt a long-term strategic approach and investors are looking to boards to oversee the integration of ESG considerations into business strategy and to monitor progress and performance over time. At the same time growing recognition of stakeholder interests means that boards may also need to play a more active role in overseeing stakeholder engagement and ensure such interests are appropriately accounted for in key business decisions for the benefit of the enterprise.

Accelerating Disclosure and Moving to Assurance and Integration. In 2020 we saw significant strides in the push to create standardized and comparable ESG disclosures with five of the major ESG disclosure frameworks including SASB and the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) committing to creating a comprehensive corporate reporting system. With ESG reporting entering the mainstream and reporting standards beginning to converge we expect companies that have yet to issue ESG reports to face increased investor pressure to do so and for companies that have already made ESG disclosures to continue to improve the scope quality and comparability of their disclosures. Heading into 2021 we also anticipate a growing focus on how companies provide assurance and verification for their ESG data. Boards and management will need to decide the scope of any assurance conducted by third-party service providers and how to ensure that internal reporting processes yield accurate and verifiable data.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlydmluZXN0YW5kYXJkLmNvbS8yMDIxL3R3by1pcnZpbmUtY29tcGFuaWVzLXdpbGwtcm9sbC1vdXQtbmV4dC1nZW4tdHJ1Y2tzLXRoaXMtc3VtbWVyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Two Irvine companies will roll out next-gen trucks this summer,"Irvine-based Rivian will deliver the world’s first electric (and fastest) truck in June and is “primed to set the automotive world on its head” according to Car and Driver magazine.

World’s first electric truck

Make/model: Rivian R1T

Price: $67500

0-60: 3 seconds

Launch: June 2021

Irvine-based Rivian will deliver the world’s first electric (and fastest) truck in June and is “primed to set the automotive world on its head” according to Car and Driver magazine.

The auto industry is abuzz. Why? The interior is warm and rich rivaling a Lamborghini and its electric motors and low center of gravity deliver a sports-car feel. “There’s not a faster truck in the world” says Rivian Executive Creative Director Larry Parker. It will take you from 0-60 mph in 3 seconds and take you off-road into the mountains. “It’s designed for the outdoors” he says “whether it’s a journey through South America or a weekend trip with your friends.”

Why have Amazon Ford and T. RowePrice invested in Rivian? Rivian closed on $2.6 billion in funding last month bringing its total to $8 billion. Experts put its valuation at $27.6 billion. Ford has invested $500 million while Amazon invested $700 million. Other investors include T. Rowe Price and BlackRock. “Over the last decade Rivian has been creating a robust organization built for the long term” Parker says.

What about Rivian’s Irvine expansion? Rivian’s presence in Irvine began as a team of 16 people focused on battery technologies. As that team grew Parker says Rivian saw Irvine as the ideal location for its future headquarters. “Access to top talent to off-road driving the beach and the diversity that California has to offer is really enticing to our organization” he says.

A whole new class of vehicle

Make/model: Hyundai Santa Cruz

Price: Not yet announced

Style: Compact crossover

Launch: July 2021

With the Santa Cruz Hyundai has created a whole new class of pickup — a sports adventure vehicle — that is one of the most anticipated launches of 2021.

“It might be the next big thing in the pickup market” HotCars reports.

It was designed right here in Irvine so we asked Hyundai Design Manager Bradley Arnold to sum up the Santa Cruz.

“Segment shattering” he says. “It represents an entirely new class of vehicle that meets many traditional SUV-buyer needs coupled with truck-like capabilities in a design package the U.S. buyer has never seen.”

The four-door crossover is designed to appeal to younger drivers with active lifestyles — and anyone who wants a truck bed on a compact body.

“It definitely fights above its weight class” he says.

Arnold whose dad was a race-team mechanic for the Honda motocross team learned the car-design trade at the ArtCenter in Pasadena where he fell in love with “anything that had an engine was fast made some noise — and looked cool.”

He joined Hyundai because he believes in its mission: “To be provocative always pushing the envelope.”

On top of that he gets to design cars in Southern California long a hotbed for car culture.

“Every day we’re tasked with coming up with the future esthetic for the brand” he says. “And we feel this is the perfect spot to do that.”"

The victim was an adult a spokesperson for the state Fire Marshal's office said.

Firefighters were called to 16 Auclair St. at about 2:20 a.m. Saturday for a fire on the second floor of a two-family residence.

Video from the scene showed smoke and flames pouring from the home as firefighters worked to contain the blaze.

Public safety radio transmissions indicated that firefighters were alerted to a person trapped on the second floor of the building. A dispatcher told firefighters that a police officer was unable to get inside the building

Firefighters from nearby Woonsocket North Smithfield and Bellingham were called in to assist a fire department spokesman said.

The victim of the Blackstone fire is the sixth to die in a house fire in Massachusetts this year.

Two people were killed in Sheffield on Jan. 13 in a blaze caused by failure of the chimney and wood burning furnace.

Five days later an Agawam resident died in a manufactured home fire that was determined to have been caused by smoking near home oxygen.

On Jan. 19 a Holliston woman died after she raced back inside her burning home to try to rescue her dogs.

On Tuesday a Natick man was killed in a house fire that also broke out in the early morning hours.

Jennifer Meith a spokesperson for the state Department of Fire Services said January brings on average in Massachusetts between five to and seven fire-related deaths.

The fire is being investigated by the Blackstone Fire and Police Departments along with State Police assigned to both the Office of the State Fire Marshal Peter J. Ostroskey and to the Office of Worcester District Attorney Joseph D. Early.

Fire crews from neighboring Bellingham and Woonsocket (Rhode Island) provided mutual aid.

@TomFlanaganUSA

Being a first-year varsity coach always comes with a slew of learning opportunities and challenges but Blackstone Valley Tech’s Dan Morin couldn’t have possibly envisioned his rookie year coinciding with one of the more bizarre basketball seasons in history.

Through the starts and stops and highs and lows thrown at the Beavers by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic Morin & Co. are still finding success and gratitude.

BVT is off to a 4-1 start and is averaging over 60 points per game.

“It’s been a challenge across the board this season dealing with things we’ve never had to before” said Morin who has a long history of involvement with the BVT program including the four previous seasons as junior varsity coach. “Our kids have been receptive to all the adjustments we’ve asked them to make in the classroom and with basketball.”

The Beavers are led by senior Shea Finnegan who has averaged over 16 points per game after raising his profile in the offseason with the Mass Elite AAU program. On Saturday Finnegan announced his commitment to play Division III basketball at Rivier University in New Hampshire.

“It's something I've worked for and wanted to do my whole life; to play at the next level” Finnegan said. “I couldn't imagine life without basketball.”

“When Shea left after last season he was a boy but he came back a man” Morin said. “He really committed himself to building up his strength and speed so that he can get prepared to play basketball at the next level. He’s a very coachable very hungry kid who has been a great leader for us.”

Finnegan isn't alone however when it comes to dishing out praise for the Beavers' success.

Sam DiCollela may be one of the area’s most improved players. The senior who stars on the football field has tapped into his athleticism to be a critical contributor.

“Sam has put in the work and built up his basketball IQ and he’s really flourished” Morin said.

The Beavers have some size in 6-foot-7 junior center Ryan Flauto whom Morin said made great strides on his own and during AAU basketball over the summer.

Valley Tech should only get better as the season goes on thanks to the development of sophomore point guard Peyton Manyak who was a member of the varsity team last year and whose steady improvement has led to a marked increase in playing time. He joins BVT football quarterback and basketball guard Josh Mateo in the Beavers' back court.

BVT will play against Hopedale twice this upcoming week (tenatively Tuesday and Friday) in what should be a big test for both teams. The Blue Raiders earned a lopsided 86-47 win over the Beavers in last year’s Division 4 Central championship game.

It's a matchup the Beavers have circled on their calendar.

“It's going to be more personal than any other game” Finnegan said. “Not only did they beat us last year but they killed us in the finals.”

BLACKSTONE Mass. (WLNE) – Fire officials identified a man who died in a house fire in Blackstone Saturday morning.

Officials said the fire broke out at the two-family home on Auclair Street around 2 a.m.

On Tuesday the state fire marshal identified the victim as 30-year-old Teagan Lafayette.

Lafayette lived at the home according to fire officials.

The fire reportedly started in the second floor living room after a power strip failed. Due to the damage and destruction it was unclear if all or some of the electrical appliances were plugged in and running.

Investigators found two space heaters a television and an Xbox nearby.

Blackstone Fire Department’s Chief Sweeney said “On behalf of the town I offer our heartfelt condolences to the Lafayette family. This is a terrible tragedy for them.”

Sweeney continued “We are in the worst part of the winter and firefighters want everyone to keep warm and to keep safe. Make sure you have working smoke and carbon monoxide alarms on every level of your home and that they are less than 10 years old. Make a home escape plan that includes two ways out of every room and a meeting place outside.”

For more safety tips go to www.mass.gov/keepwarmkeepsafe.

The Red Cross said they are assisting two adults who escaped the fire but are now displaced.

State Fire Marshal Ostroskey said “While we cannot say for certain that one or both space heaters were plugged into the power strip it appears likely they overloaded it. I cannot stress enough how important it is to plug any heat generating appliance directly into the wall. Power strips are not designed to support the energy needed by a space heater.”

(NYSE:BX) is about to go ex-dividend in the next 4 days. You will need to purchase shares before the 5th of February to receive the dividend which will be paid on the 16th of February.

Blackstone Group's next dividend payment will be US$0.96 per share. Last year in total the company distributed US$2.26 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments Blackstone Group has a trailing yield of 3.4% on the current stock price of $67.19. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable and if the company is growing.

View our latest analysis for Blackstone Group

Dividends are usually paid out of company profits so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Blackstone Group paid out 151% of profit in the past year which we think is typically not sustainable unless there are mitigating characteristics such as unusually strong cash flow or a large cash balance.

When the dividend payout ratio is high as it is in this case the dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut in the future.

Click here to see the company's payout ratio plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.

Have Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?

Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut the company could see its value fall precipitously. With that in mind we're encouraged by the steady growth at Blackstone Group with earnings per share up 6.0% on average over the last five years.

Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Since the start of our data 10 years ago Blackstone Group has lifted its dividend by approximately 6.5% a year on average. We're glad to see dividends rising alongside earnings over a number of years which may be a sign the company intends to share the growth with shareholders.

To Sum It Up

Is Blackstone Group an attractive dividend stock or better left on the shelf? While we like that its earnings are growing somewhat we're not enamored that it's paying out 151% of last year's earnings. This is not an overtly appealing combination of characteristics and we're just not that interested in this company's dividend.

So if you're still interested in Blackstone Group despite it's poor dividend qualities you should be well informed on some of the risks facing this stock. Our analysis shows 3 warning signs for Blackstone Group and you should be aware of them before buying any shares.

We wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see though. Here's a list of interesting dividend stocks with a greater than 2% yield and an upcoming dividend.

BA,Boeing,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyYXRpbmdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2JvZWluZy1jb250aW51ZXMtdGVjaG5vbG9neS13b3JrLTc5Ny_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Boeing continues technology work on 797,"The Boeing 797 – an aircraft that airline passengers will love – is back on the drawing board despite Boeing’s record 2020 loss.

Speaking with a select group of analysts this week Boeing’s president and chief executive officer David Calhoun said that the aerospace giant is progressing well on engineering and manufacturing forward technology development according to one who spoke with Airlineratings.com.

Mr Calhoun also added that it is ready when that moment comes “to offer a really differentiated product.”

And that product is expected to be what is called a middle-of-the-market twin-aisle 220-270 seat aircraft with a range of about 10 to 11 hours.

The configuration would likely be 2-3-2 in economy 1-2-2 in premium economy and 1-1-1 in business class.

READ: Qatar Airways the world’s favourite airline

The 797 will be made of composite material like the 787 and have all-new engines but will be designed just for medium-haul routes and thus not be as heavy.

The secret to the economics of the 797 which would sit between the single-aisle 737 and the much larger 787 is new technology.

Late last year Mr. Calhoun told media that Boeing has “some incredible underlying technologies that are going to support the point-design for that next airplane” and it would assess the market toward the end of this year.

Boeing had put the design effort on ice and the beginning of COVID but has since reactivated work.

The reality is that competitive pressure from Airbus is forcing Boeing to move forward.

Boeing’s largest 737 the MAX 10 cannot match the Airbus A321neoXLR which can seat up to 240 in an all-economy layout and fly up to 9000km whereas the MAX 10 has a range of 6100km with 230 passengers.

That range shortfall is critical in the COVID-19 world with non-stop capability essential to bypass virus hotspots.

Boeing’s next largest offering is the 787 which can seat between 381 and 400 but carries all the structural weight -and thus cost – for long-range operations such as Perth to London nonstop.

The question for Boeing – and the market – is does it go for the more luxurious twin-aisle design or a conventional single-aisle model.

The twin-aisle concept is what was exciting airlines before COVID-19 with Qantas’s CEO Alan Joyce saying Boeing would be “crazy not to do it.”

“We think it’s a fantastic aircraft on paper that looks good for what we want. And I think they’re hearing that quite a bit” Mr. Joyce told Airlineratings.com last year.

Challenge is while the COVID-19 world is all about lower passenger numbers for the shorter-term designing and building a new design is a 30-year project.

The 797 concept is not new and has been around since the 1980s when McDonnell Douglas now merged into Boeing touted the Advanced Twin-aisle Medium Range (ATMR) aircraft (three photos below).

While Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines wanted the ATMR later named the DC-11 McDonnell Douglas management balked at the risk despite an order for 60 and shelved the design.

Boeing also showed the same concept at the 1991 Paris Air Show but couldn’t make the business casework.

Fast forward to 2021 and a raft of technology and engine improvements make a twin-aisle design viable and desirable.

COVID-19 has made passengers extremely health conscious and being cramped in an aircraft never popular – is now a major detriment to travel.

A twin-aisle aircraft would give passengers much greater space not to mention at least 50 percent more overhead baggage storage.

With airlines struggling to stay in the air launching a new design will require some innovative financing and Boeing would need to work closely with its historic partners in Japan and Italy.

China could also play a much greater sub-contracting role with a possible production line in that country.

Analysts suggest Boeing could launch in 12-months with entry into service in 2026/27.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9lbWlyYXRlcy1ib2VpbmctNzc3LTMwMGVyLWEtZnVsbC1jYWJpbi10b3VyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Emirates Boeing 777-300ER: A Full Cabin Tour,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9lbWlyYXRlcy1ib2VpbmctNzc3LTMwMGVyLWEtZnVsbC1jYWJpbi10b3VyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS93b3JsZC8yMDIxL2phbi8zMS9mYW1pbHktb2YtaW5kb25lc2lhbi1wbGFuZS1jcmFzaC12aWN0aW1zLXN1ZS1ib2VpbmctZm9yLWRhbmdlcm91cy1haXJjcmFmdNIBeGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS93b3JsZC8yMDIxL2phbi8zMS9mYW1pbHktb2YtaW5kb25lc2lhbi1wbGFuZS1jcmFzaC12aWN0aW1zLXN1ZS1ib2VpbmctZm9yLWRhbmdlcm91cy1haXJjcmFmdA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Family of Indonesian plane crash victims sue Boeing for ‘dangerous’ aircraft,"An Indonesian family whose relatives died onboard the Sriwijaya Air flight that crashed into the Java Sea have filed legal action against Boeing alleging that the aircraft was “defective and unreasonably dangerous”.

The Sriwijaya flight SJ-182 plummeted within minutes of taking off from Jakarta’s main airport earlier this month with 62 people on board.

Wisner Law Firm which is representing the family of three victims said it filed a lawsuit against Boeing last week at circuit court of Cook county in Illinois where the company’s headquarters are based.

The lawsuit alleges that the Boeing 737-500 aircraft was defective in one or more ways including possible faults in the autothrottle system which controls engine power automatically or the flight control system. Court documents also alleged possible corrosion on “the engine bleed-air fifth stage check valve… causing it to become stuck in the open position during flight resulting in an uncontrollable compressor stall”.

A preliminary report into the crash by the Indonesian authorities is expected early in February.

Investigators have managed to recover and read the plane’s flight data recorder but are still searching for the cockpit voice recorder which will allow them to listen to conversations between the pilots.

Nurcayho Utomo of Indonesia’s transportation safety committee said earlier this month that a problem with the Boeing 737-500’s autothrottle system was reported after a flight a few days earlier. Officials are probing whether this contributed to the disaster. Planes are allowed to fly with an autothrottle system that is not working because pilots can control it manually instead according to Utomo.

The aircraft did not have the same cockpit software that contributed to the two fatal crashes of Boeing’s 737 MAX in Indonesia and Ethiopia. A total of 346 people were killed in the crashes which occurred in the space of just six months.

Boeing was fined $2.5bn by the US justice department after being charged with fraud and conspiracy in connection with two crashes and faces separate litigation brought by families of those killed. The company reported a net loss of $11.9bn (£8.7bn) for 2020 the largest in its history.

Wisner said that only one family from the Sriwijaya Air crash had filed a case against Boeing but that the legal firm was in contact with other people whose relatives died.

Boeing said in a statement: “Our thoughts are with the Sriwijaya Air flight SJ-182 crew passengers and their families. Boeing technical experts are assisting with the investigation and we continue to offer any support needed during this difficult time.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhcmhpc3RvcnlvbmxpbmUuY29tL25ld3MvZGVmaWFudC14Lmh0bWzSAUpodHRwczovL3d3dy53YXJoaXN0b3J5b25saW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzL2RlZmlhbnQteC5odG1sL2FtcD9wcmViaWRfYWI9ZW5hYmxlZA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sikorsky Boeing Defiant X: New Helicopter Includes Many Sought After Features,"Like many armies and navies around the globe the United States invests billions of dollars annually in equipment that most people sincerely hope will never need to be employed at least not in real combat scenarios with flesh and blood enemies. Nonetheless America must always be prepared for that eventuality even if the chances of such an unwanted confrontation coming to pass are incredibly slight.

To that end the American military is now considering what to purchase as its new helicopters and in the running as a lead contender is the Defiant X an aircraft with all the bells and whistles pilots in battle could hope for at the beginning of a new century. Its prototype was designed and manufactured by Sikorsky & Boeing Company. The firm is up against rival defence manufacturer Bell Textron which has submitted a new 280 Valor helicopter. The winning bid will be announced in 2022.

The Defiant X has several features the U.S. military has asked for most notably the speed at which the aircraft can fly. One company spokesman noted that it will fly twice the distance at twice the speed a profound improvement over the helicopters currently used the Black Hawks and the AH-64 Apache attack aircraft among others.

Another improvement according to Boeing sales and marketing representative Heather McBryan is that “we’ve made some… enhancements to the design to help reduce thermal signature and improve (the) aerodynamic handling.” In layman’s terms that means the helicopter will be easier to maneuver.

Company officials have not said just how fast the Defiant X can fly but last fall it was clocked at well over 200 knots in test flights. Test pilots put in more than 25 hours in actual tests and about 1500 hours of simulations.

Sikorsky designed the Black Hawk which gave the firm a “leg up” when it came time to design the new aircraft. Designers have incorporated all the positive design elements of the old helicopter into the new and added plenty more features on the military’s “wish list.”

One of its most crucial features is its ability to last as demand – and conflict scenarios – change. McBryan added in a recent press release “This is really designed for growth and so out in the 2030s as missions change and threats change there is that growth capability.”

The Defiant X is one of the aircraft in the Future Long Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) program. This design specifically has been “optimized” according to company officials and will be well equipped to respond to changing environments for several decades yet to come.

If the Black Hawk’s history is any indication it seems likely that the American military will choose to replace these venerable machines with the new Defiant X although no one can predict this with certainty.

The Black Hawk has been the go-to helicopter of choice for the American military for more than four decades and not solely for combat missions. They are also used in medical evacuations and for transport of important military personnel.

This aircraft was named for an early 19th century Native American leader named Black Hawk renowned for his bravery and fighting skills. He was one of the top people in the Sauk Tribe which today lives mainly in areas of Minnesota.

His namesake helicopter has seen battle in places like Iraq and has been part of special operations in places like Panama. It is considered one of the finest aircraft in the fleet in U.S. aviation.

Whether the Defiant X will replace the Black Hawk remains to be seen. But if it contains all the latter’s strengths with some brand new technology and speed the odds seem to be in its favour and Sikorsky Boeing’s.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hdmlhdGlvbjI0LmJlL2FpcmxpbmVzL2Fpci1hdGxhbnRhLWljZWxhbmRpYy9hbi1haXItYXRsYW50YS1pY2VsYW5kaWMtYm9laW5nLTc0Ny00MDBmLXJldHVybnMtdG8tbGllZ2UtYWlycG9ydC1kdWUtdG8tZW5naW5lLXByb2JsZW0tc2hvcnRseS1hZnRlci10YWtlb2ZmL9IBqwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hdmlhdGlvbjI0LmJlL2FpcmxpbmVzL2Fpci1hdGxhbnRhLWljZWxhbmRpYy9hbi1haXItYXRsYW50YS1pY2VsYW5kaWMtYm9laW5nLTc0Ny00MDBmLXJldHVybnMtdG8tbGllZ2UtYWlycG9ydC1kdWUtdG8tZW5naW5lLXByb2JsZW0tc2hvcnRseS1hZnRlci10YWtlb2ZmL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,An Air Atlanta Icelandic Boeing 747-400F returns to Liege Airport due to engine problem shortly after takeoff,"An Air Atlanta Icelandic Boeing 747-400F registered TF-AMA operating flight SV3920 to Riyadh on behalf of Saudia Cargo suffered a technical incident shortly after taking off from Runway 04R triggering the precautionary procedures and a return to Liège Airport on the night of Saturday 30 to Sunday 31 January around 02:10 (UTC+1).

Residents of the area around Liege airport were awakened by a deafening noise of explosions and for some witnessed one of the four engines on fire.

The aircraft jettisoned fuel above the North Sea before safely returning to Liège Airport and landing on Runway 04R at 03:40 (UTC+1).

The airport confirmed the incident and the implementation of the emergency procedure which consists of dumping fuel over the North Sea.

It is not the first time that this aircraft has experienced problems at Liege airport. This has happened a couple of times already. Each time the checks were carried out and the flight subsequently operated normally.

But there was a hitch: While I can fix cars and write from anywhere the hard-won client base of her business (“Bugworks”) doing insect-related hands-on in-classroom educational programs in elementary schools libraries and museums was inextricably centered around Boston.

The pandemic however put a stake through the heart of her business—obviously no one is hiring in-class enrichment educators right now. So in one of those change-creates-opportunity scenarios we find ourselves entertaining the possibility of moving.

Now we love living in Newton Massachusetts one of the safest cities in the country with grade-A public schools. There’s not a lot to complain about in Newton; it’s been a great place to raise kids. But we’ve now been here for 30 years and as I’ve written repeatedly it’s a challenging place in which to accumulate cars.

I had my three-cars-easy-or-four-in-a-squeeze garage built in 2005. Then as the number of cars ratcheted up eventually I rented four garage spaces out in central Massachusetts. Now all my spaces are beyond full and I’ve borrowed two over-winter spaces from a friend.

I could pare down the fleet but where’s the fun in that? Why not use this as an opportunity to do what many people have recommended over the years and find a place in the country with a big outbuilding for the cars? The house is nearly paid off its value is high and we should be able to roll that into buying the dream right? Hell we deserve that right? I don’t see us leaving the Northeast but there’s a lot of Northeast outside Boston.

Unfortunately it’s not that easy to find garage-centric properties. A friend turned me onto CarProperty.com but most of the listings were badly out of date. Hemmings also has a real-estate section but it’s kind of thin. So I gravitated toward Zillow; I found it the easiest of the online real estate search tools to use to rapidly look at large numbers of properties.

Unfortunately none of the search engines like Zillow or Realtor.com have database checkboxes for “buyer is a car nut and looking for a car-centric property.” Zillow inexplicably allows you to specify the number of desired parking spots but not number of garage spaces; there’s just a single checkbox for “garage.” Coldwell Banker’s website allows you to check up to “5+” garage spaces but unlike Zillow it doesn’t allow you to search an entire state; instead it requires that you to select a town or a zip code. Besides I didn’t really want something where the car storage was part of the square footage of the house as that was likely to be either a pumped-up McMansion (not our style) or a multi-million dollar estate (not our budget).

So instead of checking off “garage” I wound up having to use keyword search terms and that simply doesn’t work very well. In the first place even though there is a mystique about “barn-find” cars (and I’ve long said that putting a car in a barn is preferable to leaving it outside dust and rodents notwithstanding) if you’re going to the trouble to look for a property and move there barns really aren’t the go-to automotive storage form factor. If they’re horse barns they’re divided into stalls which is the antithesis of the kind of open space you want. If they’re big horse arenas they have dirt floors. It’s not impossible to find a two-story barn built on a gentle slope where the first floor has a cement floor and the second is structurally sound enough to support cars but that’s a pretty small subset.

What I really wanted was a house with a reasonable attached garage and a large but simple metal building; that way the building isn’t part of the square footage of a bloated house. But I rapidly found that if you search for “outbuilding” Zillow and other tools show you everything where that term is used to refer to a shed that holds trash barrels or a canoe.

Also since the keyword matching on these search engines is exact “metal building” and “metal outbuilding” return different results. Searching for “car collection” or “car collector” sometimes bore fruit but again if the listing said “car collectors” instead of “collector” you’d miss it. Plus many listings would show a photo of a barn or outbuilding but include absolutely no mention of it in the description. The idea that folks like me want details on the outbuilding seems to be totally lost on many listing agents.

Much of what I found wasn’t worth seeing but it was great nightly fodder for Facebook. Oh look: Here’s an inexpensive house on a busy road in White River Junction that comes with a storage business with over 40 individual roll-up doors. Here’s one in upstate New York that has an airstrip and a hangar for a small plane. Here’s one in northern Vermont where the property has no house a long barn a long metal building with a small apartment in the back that would cause Maire Anne to divorce me and a manure pit—but on the positive side you could literally fly a paper airplane from there into Canada.

I did however stumble into this absolutely insane property in Tamworth New Hamphirewith a “car barn” that reportedly held up to a hundred cars but clearly you’re paying a huge premium for the “car barn” and the million-dollar price tag is too steep unless I want to start a business serving clients of nearby Club Motorsports. It was like after saying “more cowbell” for weeks I was forced to say “okay waaaay too much cowbell!”

Now anyone who has moved or considered moving knows that everything above is just plain silly because I’ve said nothing about the house the surrounding property or the town. I joke that I could live in a trailer next to a big metal building but it is just a joke—I enjoy nice interior living spaces as much as the next person and fortunately my tastes and Maire Anne’s are remarkably similar. We did in fact do what you’re supposed to do and sit down together and write up a list of what we were looking for.

We didn’t want a farm.

We didn’t want to run a B&B.

We wanted a mid-sized house that’s thrilling with high ceilings and exposed wood unfussy modern/contemporary preferred over Victorian or statelystyles  three or more bedrooms plus an office for me and a quilting space for her a modern-looking kitchen (not a “country kitchen”) and windows and a porch that look out onto mountains or water.

And no chandeliers. We hate those.

And storage space for at least fifteen cars. (Hey there are twelve now; that’s reasonable right?)

And affordable.

And within a 2.5-hour drive of Boston.

Yeah it’s the kind of list of requirements that would make any real-estate agent roll their eyes and say “Oh crap not more of these people. I bet they ask for dressing on the side of their salads and a slice of lemon but it’s got to be organic lemon.”

We did find a listing for a place up in Lancaster New Hampshire north of the White Mountains with a decent-looking house with a killer view and a huge second building that had been an animal-rehabilitation facility and had drive-in access on two floors. Of all the places I’d saved in Zillow this one looked interesting enough that I contacted the listing agent to arrange a tour.

When he asked me if I’d be ready to move quickly if we liked it my preternatural honesty gene kicked in and I truthfully answered no. To my surprise he politely declined to schedule a tour explaining that it likely would be sold within the week due to the insane amount of interest in northern properties from people with cash looking to escape the cities. I was stunned but he then spent 45 minutes with me on the phone advising me on what my steps I needed to take in order to be ready to pull the trigger on something. Sure enough in a few days the listing changed to “sold.”

We actually did visit one property in central Massachusetts right on the New Hampshire border that appeared on Zillow and had an open house the following day. On paper it sounded perfect: a good-size rambling old farmhouse with attached barn the basement of which had three garage spaces. There was a separate 80-by-40-foot metal outbuilding and over 60 acres of land most of which was classified as timberland so the per-acre tax rate was extremely low. As a bonus out on the timberland was a cool little off-the-grid hunting cabin. The entire property was well-priced but it was being sold as-is as part of an estate settlement. It was the only place for which we dropped everything and drove out for a look.

It turned out that the deceased owner was into vintage trucks. There were still two left in the outbuilding and an engine on a stand in the under-barn.

The rest of the barn though showed why barns aren’t a great fit for car storage. This one was warm-feeling and charming but with the horse stalls still intact it certainly wasn’t a place into which you could pack cars.

The outbuilding however was perfect. It was exactly what I wanted.

I’d assumed that since the property was classified as timberland it was built to hold logging equipment but the realtor told me that the owner had built it to house his collection of vintage trucks—in fact the realtor said he’d bought one of the cool old military trucks from the estate himself.

The problem was the house itself. It was so odd and dark that neither Maire Anne nor I could picture ourselves living there and the “as is” terms of the sale threatened to make it a money pit. If there had been a spectacular view we would’ve had something to engage our right brains but there wasn’t so it was a cut-and-dried left-brain decision: No.

The property sold a few days later. Oddly I didn’t regret it. As I said to Maire Anne as much as I love my cars and would love to have a big building on the property to hold them all I’m not going to live in the building—I’m going to live in the house.

So I flipped the search completely around took car storage out of the picture temporarily and began pounding on Zillow for houses where both the house and the view were downright dream-house-level thrilling figuring that if the property was large enough a metal outbuilding could be added at reasonable cost. I rapidly found that the cost of my definition of “dream-house-level thrilling” (post-and-beam construction high ceilings wall of windows and porch overlooking mountains or water) was about $900000 and that if it was substantially less the property was usually in the middle of nowhere. (Also FYI once you wander into Candyland start looking at places on the Downeast Maine coast with 180-degree ocean views like this sink into its narcotic grasp abandon all practicality and instead say “I don’t need no stinking back 40 to build a garage; hell with a view like this I can just sit and stare out the window all day every day” it’s really hard to bring yourself back to reality. I’m just beginning to taste my food again.)

Although the “look for the house and the view and then build the garage” model has merit it’s not a slam-dunk. Using on-line metal-building estimation tools like this one I estimated the cost of a 50-by-80-foot steel building including purchase and delivery of the structure doors and windows pouring the slab and construction at about $53000 and noted that this doesn’t include clearing trees and grading the area electrical service heat or an asphalt driveway leading to it. I asked my friend Alex who built my garage to give me a back-of-the-envelope calculation for a 50-by-80-foot metal building in New England and he came up with $85000. While that wouldn’t be out of the question if we found the right property the listings I found for killer houses with killer views we could afford were generally in remote areas so that when I emailed them to friends in Vermont for advice the reply was usually something like “Whoa do you know anyone up there?”

Interestingly it was our own David Rose Vermont resident founder of Hitting Redline LLC and BimmerLife author (and by utter coincidence childhood friend of the daughter of our longtime friends in Manchester Vermont whose house was the seed for our potential northward migration) who gave me the talking-to I needed basically telling me to stop looking for “the one” (the unicorn combination of house-garage-property-view) and instead figure out where we want to live which is a combination of proximity to family and old friends (e.g. Boston) closeness to civilization and medical centers amount of cold and winter isolation we really want to tolerate and whether the vibe of a town is our vibe. Of course Maire Anne and I knew this but it needed to be said.

The fundamental problem I realized is that we can go on Zillow for twenty minutes at a time in the evening and look at properties whereas we can’t tool around different parts of Vermont for twenty minutes at a time in the evening to see if its vibe fits us and due to a combination of winter and the pandemic that’s not an easily solvable problem in the short term. It would be easier if we could take multi-day trips to different areas to check them out but I’m not sure I see that happening in the short term.

Then we stumbled across this interesting listing in Auburn Massachusetts (just south of Worcester). The house and the attached barn although they looked old were actually of recent construction built only about 30 years ago. The house was the right size and very cool inside and the attached two-level barn was built to hold cars with room for four on each level. In addition there was a separate three-car garage. It lacked the view or way-out-in-the-country feeling we craved but it was interesting enough that I contacted the listing agent.

Unfortunately the agent said that so did another car guy and he bought it before we could see it in the flesh.

I’ll probably keep using Zillow the way many folks use Bring a Trailer which is as a look-lust-and-learn tool. It’s gratifying to me to know that if we see something we think really pushes all of our buttons we are capable of taking action whether that’s contacting the realtor (for whom I would probably dial the honesty knob down a bit next time) or showing up for the open house. The house here in Newton needs shingles and paint and a thousand small things so lining that up for spring would be smart. Hopefully come spring we’ll be vaccinated and will feel more comfortable taking overnight trips at which point it would be a natural to exercise the fun cars and see how they feel about relocation.

After all if I’m going to all this work to look for garage space I might as well admit that they are members of the family so they also get a say.—Rob Siegel",,,,,,,,,,,,

BRO,Brown & Brown,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vaGVjaGluZ2VycmVwb3J0Lm9yZy9wcm9vZi1wb2ludHMtNS10YWtlYXdheXMtc2VncmVnYXRpb24tNzAteWVhcnMtYWZ0ZXItYnJvd24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PROOF POINTS: 5 takeaways about segregation 70 years after the Brown decision,"It was one of the most significant days in the history of the U.S. Supreme Court. On May 17 1954 the nine justices unanimously ruled in Brown v. Board of Education that schools segregated by race did not provide an equal education. Students could no longer be barred from a school because of the color of their skin. To commemorate the 70th anniversary of the Brown decision I wanted to look at how far we’ve come in integrating our schools and how far we still have to go.

Two sociologists Sean Reardon at Stanford University and Ann Owens at the University of Southern California have teamed up to analyze both historical and recent trends. Reardon and Owens were slated to present their analysis at a Stanford University conference on May 6 and they shared their presentation with me in advance. They also expect to launch a new website to display segregation trends for individual school districts around the country.

Here are five takeaways from their work:

The long view shows progress but a worrying uptick especially in big cities

Source: Owens and Reardon “The state of segregation: 70 years after Brown” 2024 presentation at Stanford University.

Not much changed for almost 15 years after the Brown decision. Although Black students had the right to attend another school the onus was on their families to demand a seat and figure out how to get their child to the school. Many schools remained entirely Black or entirely white.

Desegregation began in earnest in 1968 with a series of court orders beginning with Virginia’s New Kent County schools. That year the Supreme Court required the county to abolish its separate Black and white schools and students were reassigned to different schools to integrate them.

This graph above produced by Reardon and Owens shows how segregation plummeted across the country between 1968 and 1973. The researchers focused on roughly 500 larger school districts where there were at least 2500 Black students. That captures nearly two-thirds of all Black students in the nation and avoids clouding the analysis with thousands of small districts of mostly white residents.

Reardon’s and Owens’s measurement of segregation compares classmates of the average white student with the classmates of the average Black student. For example in North Carolina’s Charlotte-Mecklenburg district the average white student in 1968 attended a school where 90 percent of his peers were white and only 10 percent were Black. The average Black student attended a school where 76 percent of his peers were Black and 24 percent were white. Reardon and Owens then calculated the gap in exposure to each race. White students had 90 percent white classmates while Black students had 24 percent white classmates. The difference was 66 percentage points. On the flip side Black students had 76 percent Black classmates while white students had 10 percent Black classmates. Again the difference was 66 percentage points which translates to 0.66 on the segregation index.

But in 1973 after court-ordered desegregation went into effect the average white student attended a school that was 69 percent white and 31 percent Black. The average Black student attended a school that was 34 percent Black and 66 percent white. In five short years the racial exposure gap fell from 66 percentage points to 3 percentage points. Schools reflected Charlotte-Mecklenberg’s demographics. In the graph above Reardon and Owens averaged the segregation index figures for all 533 districts with substantial Black populations. That’s what each dot represents.

In the early 1990s this measure of segregation began to creep up again as depicted by the red tail in the graph above. Owens calls it a “slow and steady uptick” in contrast to the drastic decline in segregation after 1968. Segregation has not bounced back or returned to pre-Brown levels. “There’s a misconception that segregation is worse than ever” Reardon said.

Although the red line from 1990 to the present looks nearly flat when you zoom in on it you can see that Black-white segregation grew by 25 percent between 1991 and 2019. During the pandemic segregation declined slightly again.

It’s important to emphasize that these Black-white segregation levels are tiny compared with the degree of segregation in the late 1960s. A 25 percent increase can seem like a lot but it’s less than 4 percentage points.

“It’s big enough that it makes me worried” said Owens. “Now is the moment to keep an eye on this. If it continues in this direction it would take a long time to get back up to Brown. But let’s not let it keep going up.”

Even more troubling is the fact that segregation increased substantially if you zero in on the nation’s biggest cities. White-Black segregation in the largest 100 school districts increased by 64 percent from 1988 to 2019 Owens and Reardon calculated.

School choice plays a role in recent segregation

Why is segregation creeping back up again?

The expiration of court orders that mandated school integration and the expansion of school choice policies including the rapid growth of charter schools explains all of the increase in segregation from 2000 onward said Reardon. Over 200 medium-sized and large districts were released from desegregation court orders from 1991 to 2009 and racial school segregation in these districts gradually increased in the years afterward.

School choice however appears to be the dominant force. More than half of the increase in segregation in the 2000s can be attributed to the rise of charter schools whose numbers began to increase rapidly in the late 1990s. In many cases either white or Black families flocked to different charter schools leaving behind a less diverse student body in traditional public schools.

The reason for the rise in segregation in the 1990s before the number of charter schools soared is harder to understand. Owens speculates that other school choice policies such as the option to attend any public school within a district or the creation of new magnet schools may have played a role but she doesn’t have the data to prove that. White gentrification of cities in the 1990s could also be a factor she said as the white newcomers favored a small set of schools or sent their children to private schools.

“We might just be catching a moment where there’s been an influx of one group before the other group leaves” said Owens. “It’s hard to say how the numbers will look 10 years from now.”

It’s important to disentangle demographic shifts from segregation increases

There’s a popular narrative that segregation has increased because Black students are more likely to attend school with other students who are not white especially Hispanic students. But Reardon and Owens say this analysis conflates demographic shifts in the U.S. population with segregation. The share of Hispanic students in U.S. schools now approaches 30 percent and everyone is attending schools with more Hispanic classmates. White students who used to represent 85 percent of the U.S. student population in 1970 now make up less than half.

Source: Owens and Reardon “The state of segregation: 70 years after Brown” 2024 presentation at Stanford University.

The blue line in the graph above shows how the classmates of the average Black Hispanic or Native American student have increased from about 55 percent Black Hispanic and Native American students in the early 1970s to nearly 80 percent Black Hispanic and Native American students today. That means that the average student who is not white is attending a school that is overwhelmingly made up of students who are not white.

But look at how the red line which depicts white students is following the same path. The average white student is attending a school that moved from 35 percent students who are not white in the 1970s to nearly 70 percent students who are not white today. “It’s entirely driven by Hispanic students” said Owens. “Even the ‘white’ schools in L.A. are 40 percent Hispanic.”

I dug into U.S. Department of Education data to show how extremely segregated schools have become less common. The percentage of Black students attending a school that is 90 percent or more Black fell from 23 percent in 2000 to 10 percent in 2022. Only 1 in 10 Black students attends an all-Black or a nearly all-Black school. Meanwhile the percentage of white students attending a school that is 90 percent or more white fell from 44 percent to 14 percent during this same time period. That’s 1 in 7. Far fewer Black or white students are learning in schools that are almost entirely made up of students of their same race.

At the same time the percentage of Black students attending a school where 90 percent of students are not white grew from 37 percent in 2000 to 40 percent in 2022. But notice the sharp growth of Hispanic students during this period. They went from 7.6 million (fewer than the number of Black students) to more than 13.9 million (almost double the number of Black students).

Most segregation falls across school district boundaries

Source: Owens and Reardon “The state of segregation: 70 years after Brown” 2024 presentation at Stanford University.

This bar chart shows how schools are segregated for two reasons. One is that people of different races live on opposite sides of school district lines. Detroit is an extreme example. The city schools are dominated by Black students. Meanwhile the Detroit suburbs which operate independent school systems are dominated by white students. Almost all the segregation is because people of different races live in different districts. Meanwhile in the Charlotte North Carolina metropolitan area over half of the segregation reflects the uneven distribution of students within school districts.

Nationally 60 percent of the segregation occurs because of the Detroit scenario: people live across administrative borders Reardon and Owens calculated. Still 40 percent of current segregation is within administrative borders that policymakers can control.

Residential segregation is decreasing

People often say there’s little that can be done about school segregation until we integrate neighborhoods. I was surprised to learn that residential segregation has been declining over the past 30 years according to Reardon’s and Owens’s analysis of census tracts. More Black and white people live in proximity to each other. And yet at the same time school segregation is getting worse.

All this matters Reardon said because kids are learning at different rates in more segregated systems. “We know that more integrated schools provide more equal educational opportunities” he said. “The things we’re doing with our school systems are making segregation worse.”

Reardon recommends more reforms to housing policy to integrate neighborhoods and more “guard rails” on school choice systems so that they cannot be allowed to produce highly segregated schools.

The Sister Wives star took to her Instagram Stories on Sunday to share a snapshot of her special day.

She first posted a photo of her outdoor gardening area in North Carolina where she spends part of her time when she's not in Flagstaff Arizona.

""The NC garden adventure begins (technically I'm at the last part of planing seasons but that's life lol)"" Janelle wrote.

After reposting several birthday messages from friends and family Janelle also shared a photo of herself grinning as she sat in front of what appears to be a homemade German chocolate cake.

""A little red faced from working in the garden"" the TLC star wrote noting that the cake -- which her daughter Madison Brush made -- was mouth watering.

On Monday Janelle shared a video of herself with her new garden and planters boxes writing ""I'll be spending a lot of the summer in NC with Maddie Caleb and the kids so Maddie and I have made big plans for a garden. I am looking forward to learning how to grow veggies in a climate that has such a long season and way more moisture than I'm used to.""

It's been a challenging few months for Janelle whose son Garrison Brown died of suicide in March at the age of 25. Garrison was one of Janelle and her ex Kody Brown's six biological children.

Last month Janelle took to Instagram to honor what would have been Garrison's 26th birthday with a touching tribute video.

""Happy Birthday Sweetheart"" she wrote at the time. ""We are missing you terribly today. It’s hard to believe you aren’t here anymore.""

The Brown family has been estranged in recent years in the wake of Christine Janelle and Meri Brown's splits from Kody. Kody's relationship with his only remaining wife Robyn Brown and his presumed favoritism toward her has also caused friction between the former polygamist and his older children.

This was thoroughly documented on Sister Wives particularly his fractured relationship with his sons Garrison and Gabriel.

ET spoke with Janelle and Christine in November 2023 about Kody's estrangement from some of his family members. Janelle said that Kody wanted to have a better relationship with his kids.

""I think that's probably the goal right? He will eventually figure out how to have a relationship with his children. I mean I hope it will over time"" she told ET at the time.

If you or someone you know is considering suicide please contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255) text ""STRENGTH"" to the Crisis Text Line at 741-741 or go to suicidepreventionlifeline.org.

Brown Dish on This Is Us Podcast (Exclusive),"Mandy Moore Sterling K. Brown and Chris Sullivan are teaming up to launch a This Is Us rewatch podcast titled That Was Us.

PEOPLE has an exclusive look at the podcast's new trailer which teases what fans can expect when That Was Us officially makes its debut on Tuesday May 14.

Moore Brown and Sullivan also chatted with PEOPLE to discuss what they're most excited about what episodes they're feeling a bit anxious to revisit and why the NBC show's impact remains years later.

Mandy Moore Sterling K. Brown and Chris Sullivan are ready to get in touch with their Pearson and Pittsburgh roots!

The trio is just one week away from launching their This Is Us rewatch podcast aptly titled That Was Us — and Moore Brown and Sullivan tell PEOPLE they can't contain their excitement!

""I’m very much looking forward to a Pearson family reunion"" says Moore 40 noting that they're ""excited to get everybody in the studio with us.""

""I don’t think any one of us was ready for the show to end"" continues the actress who played matriarch Rebecca Pearson. ""This show will forever hold a special place in my heart and I think a lot of people feel the same way.""

Brown who played Randall Pearson says he was in London promoting his film American Fiction when he realized the widespread impact of This Is Us.

""I realized that folks over there were kinda just discovering the show and it was moving them the same way folks in America were moved when we were on the air"" he recalls. ""And I just realized whenever folks come to it wherever they’re from they are impacted. And it made me want to revisit it again.""

Sullivan who played Toby Damon adds: ""We missed each other! Nobody was ready for the show to end when it did even though it was wrapped up to perfection. And fans were telling us that they had started rewatching and so we figured why not watch along with them? I’m excited to see everybody again and share in our love for the show.""

This Is Us aired on NBC from Sept. 2016 to May 2022. The family drama centered on the lives of siblings Kevin (Justin Hartley) Kate (Chrissy Metz) and Randall (Brown) and their parents Rebecca (Moore) and Jack (Milo Ventimiglia). The series used multiple timelines showing stories that took place in the present as well as flashbacks to the siblings’ childhood and flash-forwards to later years.

The NBC drama earned numerous accolades throughout its run. It received 39 Emmy nominations winning four. Additionally it also received the Television Academy Honors Award in 2017.

The trio tells PEOPLE they've already recorded episodes with show creator Dan Fogelman as well as Susan Kelechi Watson who played Randall's wife Beth Pearson. They also have plans to welcome Hartley and Jon Huertas (Miguel Rivas) as guests on the podcast.

The podcast — which PEOPLE can exclusively debut its new trailer — will also feature an emotional support hotline for fans to call and share their thoughts about the show and its impact.

Brown 48 says knowing how much the show has meant to people and continues to resonate is ""incredibly gratifying.""

""While the show was incredibly timely when it was on the air it also has a certain sense of timelessness. So whenever folks come to it it can’t help but move you"" he says.

Sullivan 43 echoes his costar noting ""The themes of this show are eternal and they are presented in a way that allows the audience to explore these subjects within themselves and gives them the context to discuss these topics with the people they love. The show is about connection providing its audience with the opportunity to connect.""

Moore who has since welcomed two little boys of her own says she's particularly excited to now rewatch the series from a mother's perspective.

""It’s been such a thrill to rewatch this series. The cast and the writers are just so incredibly talented that each episode has copious amounts of takeaways"" she explains. ""There’s obviously a lot of excitement in reigniting conversations that meant a lot to fans as well as excitement in reuniting and reminiscing.""

""But what I’m seeing as we rewatch is that my viewing perspective has shifted and it’s like watching it all unfold for the first time"" she notes. ""It’s been eight years since This Is Us premiered and I’ve lived a lot of life since then. I’m now a mom with two little boys and so I’m excited to rewatch all the episodes and rediscover the stories from a new perspective.""

Another special moment for the cast has been revisiting episodes of their costars who are no longer alive and honoring their legacy. (Ron Cephas Jones who played Randall's biological father William Hill died in August 2023 at age 66.)

""We try to honor Ron at every turn. Rewatching his performance is an education on acting and humanity. He is one of the most self-realized people I have ever had the pleasure of knowing"" says Sullivan.

""Oh boy it’s gonna hit hard! I can’t tell you exactly how I’ll react but it’ll be powerful. It was powerful shooting it and powerful watching it the first time"" adds Brown. ""I don’t anticipate it being any different.""

Ron Cephas Jones as William Hill on 'This Is Us'.

Ultimately the cast is just looking forward to fans finally being able to hear their new project and reigniting the bond they had for so long during the NBC hit's six-season run.

""It’s human nature for us as a society to seek connection and This Is Us connects people all around the world with the storylines themes and topics that are presented in every episode"" says Moore. ""Fans continue to watch and rewatch sharing what This Is Us means to them how it helped them navigate life differently not feel alone and even heal from trauma. Revisiting the Pearson’s stories can help us all do a bit of collective healing I think.""

But it didn’t take Brown too long after forcing his way off the team in 2019 to start thinking differently. Even in February 2020 he already acknowledged he didn’t realize how good he had it. He discussed Roethlisberger among many topics in a recent interview with Jason Whitlock.

“Ben Roethlisberger is the best quarterback I ever played with as far as the skill level and the skill set and the intangibles of what we was able to do” Brown told Whitlock. “Like sometimes I did some stuff and Ben just he already knew what I was gonna do and he just threw the ball and laughed because he knew”.

Of course Roethlisberger and Brown had nine years to forge a connection. He never had anywhere near that length of time to build the nuances with Tom Brady that he had elsewhere. But Roethlisberger is a Hall of Fame quarterback in his own right and the numbers with Brown speak for themselves. What’s notable however is that Brown also spoke glowingly about his off-field relationship with Roethlisberger.

“We had Big Ben house playing basketball cookouts in the pool” he noted going back to his rookie season. Brown also referenced the many workouts Roethlisberger organized at Georgia University. Recalling that Roethlisberger was under great scrutiny in 2010 during Brown’s rookie season he recalled his rare relationship he built. “I was one of those players that was able to get open with him” he said.

Brown also referenced a wide variety of experiences he and Roethlisberger shared including flights on the quarterback’s private jet. This is a very different tone than the one he took while attempting to orchestrate a trade. He painted a picture of a soulless organization that didn’t care about him as a person. Today’s equivalent I suppose is unfollowing your team on social media.

Roethlisberger’s relationship with Brown though is unquestionably on the field and Brown understands what that means in terms of his legacy. “Ben is one of my best teammates. That’s one of the quarterbacks and one of the teammates I had the most fun [with] and being able to have the most success of becoming who I was because of him” he said.

But more than that he seems to regret the deterioration of the relationship they had off the field. He admits that in hindsight perhaps he “should have opened up and expressed more” during his schism from the team. Brown said that Roethlisberger is the last person he spoke to before the trade. Roethlisberger offered him very thoughtful advice he suggested.

“Big Ben was always a bright spot for me at the Steelers and somebody that always uplifted me and was there for me as a big brother” Brown said of Roethlisberger. One wonders what kind of presence he has influencing his life today. I’m sure he would like to redo many things over the past five years but life doesn’t work that way."

DALLAS (NEXSTAR) — This weekend Bill Goldberg one of professional wrestling’s biggest stars from decades ago steps back into the ring at 54 years old to compete for a championship.

It’s a move World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) hopes brings eyeballs back to an industry that’s struggled to keep its viewership during a pandemic that has emptied arenas.

As we’ve seen in the movie and television industry nostalgia sells — and Bill Goldberg is a beloved throwback for many fans of sports entertainment. In the late 1990s there weren’t many wrestlers hotter than World Championship Wrestling’s Goldberg.

The former college football standout burst onto the scene in 1997 going 173-0 at the beginning of his career — including a victory over Hulk Hogan in front of tens of thousands in Atlanta’s Georgia Dome. He was one of the industry’s biggest stars at one of the peaks of the professional wrestling business.

Twenty-four years later television audiences are much smaller for professional wrestling and in-person crowds are non-existent due to the pandemic. However WWE hopes the former star has enough left in the tank to create a buzz at Sunday’s Royal Rumble event.

The big question: Can he be the 30-year-old version of himself at 54? Goldberg admits he’s not the same athlete he was more than two decades ago but argues he can still entertain crowds.

Drew McIntyre 35 is the WWE champion Goldberg will face on Sunday.

“He’s the face of a new generation. He is. I really can appreciate a lot of the things that he’s done” Goldberg noted.

Even in a business where the winner is predetermined there’s an expectation that the performers put on a top-notch show and compete at a high level. As you can imagine that takes top conditioning cardio and strength.

All eyes will be on the 54-year-old Goldberg Sunday to see if he can keep up in the fast-paced action-packed world of professional wrestling — and provide the spark WWE fans are looking for.

It's no wonder the Amalfi Coast is one of the world's most alluring destinations on Earth. What was a collection of humble fishing villages until the 1950s has become an international symbol of glamor the epitome of la dolce vita.

So how do you plan a trip to this glitzy destination without breaking the bank? And which hotels restaurants and experiences are actually worth splurging on? Read on to find out.

Getting There

The closest airport is Naples International Airport (NAP) and from there you can take a ferry train or car to the coast. In 2019 United launched seasonal direct flights from Newark Liberty International (EWR) to Naples International (NAP). Award flights are available from 33000 miles each way. Delta has some award flight availability for upwards of 93000 points round trip but you'll have to make at least one stopover in Rome. Other mileage redemption options include Air Canada's Aeroplan American Airlines AAdvantage and Iberia Avios.

From Naples the absolute best way to get to the coast is by private car transfer but that'll cost you between €100 and €120 ($112 to $135) each way. The cheapest way to get to Sorrento — the gateway to the Amalfi Coast — is to take the Circumvesuviana train but it's also the least comfortable way to go. A good alternative is to take the ferry from the port of Napoli to Sorrento which will cost a much more reasonable €13.20 ($14.83) one way. Renting a car is another option but be aware that the sharply curving narrow coastal roads are not the easiest to navigate — and drivers from this part of Italy are notoriously bad.

Also keep in mind that when you go — and how far in advance you book — will affect the price of flights and hotels. Summer is high season on the Amalfi Coast so you can expect flights and hotels to be most expensive then. Most hotels close for the winter usually from the end of October until Easter. Your best bet for reasonably priced hotels and flights is to go in the spring or fall. According to Skyscanner the best time to book a flight to Italy is 12 weeks out.

Where to Stay

Though the Amalfi Coast is known for having some of Italy's glitziest hotels you can find budget options for less than $50 per night by searching OTAs like Booking.com. Unfortunately points-based hotels are extremely limited. Marriott only has one hotel in Naples and Hilton has just one hotel in Sorrento.

However it might be worth becoming a member of the Leading Hotels of the World's Leaders Club if you want a truly extraordinary stay in this part of the world. Several of the Amalfi Coast's most storied and glamorous hotels — including Le Sirenuse in Positano Palazzo Avino in Ravello Hotel Santa Caterina in Amalfi and the Grand Hotel Excelsior Vittoria in Sorrento — are LHW members.

If your budget allows it you could spend a few nights in an Airbnb or low-cost hotel and then splurge on a night or two at one of those properties which are truly the crème de la crème of the Amalfi Coast. Going during the shoulder season will also help you save on rates at these hotels which can double or triple during the high season.

Where to Eat and Drink

Another way to soak up some of the glamor of the area's most gorgeous hotels without splurging on a room is to stop by for drinks or a meal. At the al fresco Franco's Bar at Le Sirenuse an Aperol Spritz will set you back €12 ($13) — a pittance compared to the nightly room rates which can run you €1632 ($1830) per night.

The Michelin-starred Rossellini's Restaurant at Palazzo Avino is one of the best places on the coast for fine dining. A tasting menu dinner there will cost between €150 and €180 ($168 to $202) which isn't cheap but is a lot less than paying upwards of €770 ($864) for a room. Here waiters donning white jackets glide around the restaurant depositing artful dishes like Mediterranean lobster alla catalana and saffron risotto. If you like fine wines ask the sommelier for a tour of the hotel's wine cellar and he or she will certainly oblige.

Of course there are plenty of moderately priced restaurants like Ristorante Da Costantino in Positano and Kasai in Praiano which serves delicious food in a charmingly rustic environment.

For a quick espresso and a pastry stop by the historic Pasticceria Pansa in Amalfi. And remember if you want to save your hard-earned cash drink your espresso standing up at the bar like the Italians do. Normally an espresso costs €1 to €2 ($1.12 to $2.24) at the bar but the price spikes if you sit and get table service. The same goes if you want to grab a panino at lunchtime. Many bars and cafés offer premade panini that they'll heat up for you to take out or eat at the bar.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iYS5jb20vd2l6YXJkcy93aXphcmRzLW5ldC1yZWNhcC0wMTMxMjHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Recap: Wizards win a 149-146 thriller over Nets as Westbrook Beal combine for 78,"addByline(""Jackson Filyo"" ""WashingtonWizards.com"");

FINAL: Wizards 149 | Nets 146

SCORING LEADERS

Wizards: Russell Westbrook (41) Bradley Beal (37) Moritz Wagner (17)

Nets: Kevin Durant (37) Joe Harris (30) Kyrie Irving (26)

SUMMARY

In one of the most thrilling games of the season the Wizards defeated the Nets 149-146 on Sunday night with an 8-0 run in the final eight seconds of the game. After Kyrie Irving hit a pair of free throws to put Brooklyn up five with 12 seconds left in the game Bradley Beal raced up the court and converted on a pull-up 3-pointer to cut the lead to two. Garrison Mathews intercepted the Nets’ inbounds pass and quickly found Russell Westbrook who knocked down the game-winning three with 4.3 seconds left.

“This was the craziest game one of the craziest – if not the craziest that I’ve ever been around” Wizards head coach Scott Brooks said postgame. “We fought we battled we clawed and we gave ourselves a chance. Hopefully this is the start of something that we’re going to be pretty proud of.”

Westbrook led the way with a season-high 41 points 10 rebounds and eight assists. Beal finished with 37 points 22 of which came in the fourth quarter. The Wizards’ star backcourt combined for 37 points on 68.4% from the field in the fourth quarter.

Beal now has 10 games this season with 30-plus points tied for the most in the NBA. He’s scored at least 25 points in 15 straight games one shy of tying Michael Jordan for the longest such streak to start a season since the NBA-ABA merger.

The Nets playing without newly acquired guard and three-time scoring champion James Harden (left thigh contusion) jumped out to an early 14-4 lead when Kevin Durant and Joe Harris each knocked down a pair of threes in the first 3:04 of the game. As a team Brooklyn shot 7-11 (.636) from deep in the first quarter and controlled most of the first quarter. Westbrook kept Washington afloat scoring 11 points in the first on 4-6 (.667) from the field and 2-2 (1.000) from 3-point range. Davis Bertans knocked down a running 3-pointer at the first quarter buzzer to cut what had been an 18-point Nets lead to 10. Washington’s run carried into the second quarter as Moe Wagner and Ish Smith scored eight consecutive points for the Wizards before a Westbrook layup cut the lead to one. From 2:58 in the first quarter to 9:50 left in the second the Wizards went on a 24-7 run. After Brooklyn countered to re-take a nine-point lead the Wizards stormed back again this time taking the lead on Bradley Beal and-one layup. Durant scored seven points in the final 3:20 of the half to give the Nets a 71-65 lead.

The scoring pace continued into the third quarter as Washington and Brooklyn combined for 73 points and 56.0% from the floor. The Wizards’ struggles from beyond the arc persisted but seven points from Westbrook and 19 bench points kept the Wizards within reach heading into the fourth. Down by as many as 10 early in the final frame the Wizards slowly worked their way back into reach behind their backcourt heroics. As a team the Wizards shot 60.0% from the field and 50.0% from three on their way to 48 points the most they’ve scored in a single quarter this season putting them in position for the game-winning sequence. After Westbrook nailed the go-ahead 3-pointer the Nets had a chance at a game-winner of their own but missed a layup with less than a second left.

The Wizards win snaps a four-game losing streak and gives them four consecutive home wins over the Nets in D.C.

THREE THINGS TO KNOW

Westbrook does it all for Washington

Coming off a then-season-high 26 points Friday against Atlanta Westbrook turned in his best performance of the season when the Wizards needed it most. His 41 points the most he’s scored since February of 2020 came by way an efficient 16-28 (.571) from the field 4-7 (.571) from 3-point range and 5-7 (.714) at the free throw line. He was active on the defensive end adding two steals and a block. Westbrook did most of his damage in the second half totaling 22 points six rebounds seven assists and zero turnovers.

“Russell willed this game” Brooks said. “This is what he does. He can do it every night. He doesn’t take nights off…He plays hard he competes he lays everything on the floor.”

Smith Wagner shine as three more Wizards return to action

After Davis Bertans Rui Hachimura and Moe Wagner returned from health and safety protocols on Friday it was Deni Avdija and Ish Smith on Sunday who saw their first game action in 20 days. Troy Brown Jr. dressed but did not play. Wagner and Smith each played their best games of the year. Wagner finished with a season-high 17 points highlighted by four dunks and a buzzer-beating jumper at the end of the third quarter. Smith finished with a season-high 13 points and got an early start scoring seven points on 3-4 (.750) from the field in the first quarter and made his presence known on both ends. Smith finished with two steals and a block from behind defending Kyrie Irving in isolation.

“I thought Ish and Moe came in and turned the game around” Brooks said postgame. They just absolutely came in and turned the game around. That just tells you right there – do the right things and be patient and when your time comes make and impact. They both made an impact tonight.”

Durant Harris fuel Nets offense

The back-and-forth affair featured high-scoring star-level performances on both ends. The Nets were led by 37 points from Kevin Durant and 30 points from Joe Harris. The duo combined to shoot 61.1% from the field and Harris alone shot 8-13 (.615) from three. Durant and Harris were two of four Nets players to top the 20-point mark – Irving (26 points) and former Wizard Jeff Green (23 points) did so as well. As a team the Nets shot 56.8% from the field and 52.8% from 3-point range.

Pregame Notes

Some of the most notable teams being talked about in the Eastern Conference are the Philadelphia 76ers the Brooklyn Nets and the Washington Wizards. Now two of those teams sit atop in the East while one team is at the bottom of the bunch. But despite how high one team is and how really low the other is one remains undefeated in the season series and that’s Washington.

Yes although the Wizards only played the Nets once they were victorious as Bradley Beal scored 27 points and 10 rebounds in the 123-122 win. At that time though one of the biggest trades this season hadn’t occurred yet. About a week later the Nets traded for James Harden in a deal that included the Houston Rockets and the Cleveland Cavaliers. This is definitely a huge difference from when the Wizards played them on January 3.

Things are different for Brooklyn but pretty much the same for the Wizards as they’re currently on a four-game losing streak and Beal is the leading scorer in the league averaging 34.7 points per game (let’s make sure he’s an All-Star folks!).

Washington hasn’t been playing with a full roster after many players were under the health and safety protocol. That should change on Sunday but only time will tell. It could make a slight difference for the Wizards but serious doubt as defense isn’t exactly on Washington’s mind at all this season. And if they plan on stopping Kevin Durant (who is second in scoring) Kyrie Irving and Harden then now is the time to start thinking about some defensive measures.

Game time on Sunday is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET and being televised on NBC Sports Washington as well as NBA TV."

In addition a separate group of donors has raised nearly $1.4 million to fund $250 teacher bonuses to reward and retain Catholic school educators who have been teaching students in person since the fall.

The injection of about $3.2 million in private funding arrives at a critical time for the archdiocese which last week announced the closure of four of its schools and the consolidations of dozens of parishes in the city and suburbs in part because of rising debt and declining enrollment.

Tim Liston director of donor engagement and partnerships for Big Shoulders Fund left donates boxes of books for students at St. Francis de Sales High School to school Principal Roni Facen in Chicago on Jan. 29 2021.

Officials at the Big Shoulders Fund a nonprofit that supports 72 of the highest-need Catholic schools in Chicago said the $1.8 million emergency donation will help a “significant number” of schools at risk of closing because of financial hardships worsened during the pandemic. The recent donation is earmarked for 58 schools according to archdiocese officials.

“At the end of the day these schools are community-based organizations in underserved neighborhoods” said Big Shoulders President and CEO Josh Hale.

“Our kids and our teachers have done a heroic job throughout the pandemic and I think when we look back at this part of our history we’ll be able to say they succeeded enormously” Hale added.

In addition to educating students the 72 schools in the Big Shoulders network also are hubs for social services including providing food and rent support for struggling families.

Shauntae Davis principal of St. Margaret of Scotland School 9833 S. Throop St. in the Longwood Manor neighborhood on the South Side said she received an instant message from a former student Friday morning that underscored the importance of the school’s mission.

“I was still a teacher when she was a student here and she thanked me for being that positive person in her life … she’s now a college student at DePaul” said Davis who is also a St. Margaret alumnus.

As the 197 students and 25 teachers at the prekindergarten through eighth grade school celebrate National Catholic Schools Week starting Sunday Davis said this year’s festivities are arriving after nearly 11 months of dealing with pandemic-related obstacles.

“What’s most rewarding to me is that while we were forced to shut down and switch to virtual learning last March we’ve been able to serve our children in person since the start of the school year” Davis said. “It’s been challenging but we were able to reopen our school and reopen safely which is the biggest thing.”

Jim Rigg superintendent of Catholic Schools for the archdiocese said the archdiocese and Big Shoulders founded during Cardinal Joseph Bernardin’s tenure have enjoyed “a very long and extremely beneficial relationship.”

“Big Shoulders has been an essential partner especially for our schools in high poverty communities and we’re always working very closely with them and their help has been absolutely essential” Rigg said.

The schools receiving the emergency funds all have seen steep declines in revenue because of enrolling students whose families have been hit hardest by the pandemic Rigg said.

“These students have parents who have lost their jobs or been furloughed or a family member is sick and unable to work” Rigg said. “All of this has created financial hardships for families and the Catholic schools and Big Shoulders was kind enough to step in.”

While Rigg said there was a possibility that some of the schools funded by Big Shoulders could have been considered for closure because of budget deficits officials at the archdiocese “never got to that point.”

“This donation helped prevent having to have that conversation” Rigg said.

Despite the recent consolidations of dozens of parishes Rigg said he remains optimistic that the latest reconfiguration of parishes under the Renew My Church initiative could channel new revenue streams to Catholic schools through support agreements after the parish mergers.

While enrollment at archdiocese schools has dipped slightly during the pandemic Rigg said some schools have seen an uptick in new students from families seeking in-person instruction.

“It’s always painful to close schools but it’s an initial step that will bring renewal and growth in the future” Rigg said.

Now with the arrival of Catholic Schools Week Rigg said the nearly $1.4 million that was raised by private donors in just two weeks has created a “gratitude fund” to reward the archdiocese’s 5000 school employees at 162 schools.

The fund will be distributed equitably Rigg said with all full-time workers receiving $250 and part-timers receiving up to $100.

“Because of COVID we can’t allow the traditional open houses and large celebrations we typically have each year during Catholic Schools Week which is a time when we do a lot of our recruiting” Rigg said. “Next week we’re hoping to focus on gratitude to our teachers students and parents and all those who support Catholic education.”

RPI aims to address access to quality affordable health care that impacts maternal and infant mortality among poor urban and rural dwellers in Liberia.

The 20 new GVTs were recruited by RPI Clinic as community health workers (CHW) in Chicken Soup Factory Community Gardnersville Township and have since been working with that health facility.

Speaking at program marking closure of the first training cycle the Program Manager of the National Eye Health Program at the Ministry of Health Dr. Joseph L. Kerkula lauded RPI for initiating the exercise stating that the program is in the right direction for early detection.

Dr. Kerkula pointed out that blindness has got negative impact on the family and the society at large as it gives rise to poverty and as such it must be tackled at an early stage.

“I think the step taken by Refugee Place International is in the right direction in the promotion of eye health. We need more clinical refractionists to help in addressing our eye problems” he said.

“If we must bridge the acute shortage in eye health technicians we need to start now by training more people and this is why I said this step is in the right direction. We will need to strengthen human resource capacity in eye health so as to make some improvements in this area.”

Dr. Kerkula also stressed the need for motivation and deployment of eye health technicians/GVTs in rural parts of the country.

[bsa_pro_ad_space id=1]

He also urged the GVTs to deliver quality service to their people as eye health remains cardinal health issue.

“There is a need for motivation and equitable deployment. This is key if we must promote eye health. It has been realized that nearly all of the eye health technicians are just right within Montserrado specifically Monrovia too. We must make a change” he added.

Also speaking at the occasion via mobile conversation the Founder and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of RPI Dr. Mosoka P. Fallah said the vision is to screen 30000 persons during the course of 2021.

“Eye problem is a serious issue and we want to tackle this mainly. Some of these minor eye problems need to be addressed at an early stage because people who fall in this category could have been people that supposed to transform our society” the former Director of the National Public Health Institute of Liberia noted.

“We want to mix screening with referral and basic care. We want to protect their eyes to live better lives. We want to make some extension to be able to provide surgical services for women” he continued.

Like the guest speaker Dr. Fallah also called on the newly trained GVTs to be passionate about the job they do because vision is critical.

“You must be able to give everyone access to good vision because vision is life” he cautioned.

Mr. Thomas Remont Executive Director of RPI in an interview with this paper vowed to execute the project plans that are on the plate of the organization to benefit Liberians.

Remont a trained Optician said he has brought new vision different perspective and new ideas to implement the programs of RPI together with the staff on ground.

“I will be managing daily operations of RPI as well as finding new partners developing new projects; we have idea to implement our agriculture projects water projects on top of the eye project there is a clinic and I will have to try to find grant for these projects. It will be a quite broad job to do” explained the Frenchman who also served as Executive Director of OneDollar Glasses in Burkina Faso.

Providing a statistical data Madam Cecelia S. Howard head of the Care Model Services division at the clinic disclosed that since its establishment in 2014 the RPI clinic has treated 77655 patients and carried out 2024 deliveries without a single death despite Liberia being the second country with the highest maternal mortality rate.

She recounted that the clinic has also been able to vaccinate 18764 children and pregnant women through strong partnership with the Ministry of Health’s Immunization Program.

“Furthermore we started a community health program in 2015. Through this we recruited and trained general community health volunteers from our catchment community based on recommendation from the community leadership. Our catchment areas include: Bassa Town Chicken Soup Factory and Gulf Community” Madam Howard revealed. Editing by Jonathan Browne",,,,,,

But that scorching Caribbean heat was nothing compared to the electric energy of the moment: the sea of neon and pastel feathers bouncing to the music the hands reaching toward the sky and feet stomping in unison the strangers hugging as though they were old friends. The heat didn't matter because the only thing I felt was joy.

Every year right before Lent thousands of people from around the world wait for this moment: Carnival Tuesday the culmination of days of huge parties called fetes. Over the week my body is doused in paint oil and mud and moves in positions that would make some people blush. I welcome drink and shun sleep then repeat. In Trinidad my days end at Maracas Beach with an ice cold Carib beer and a view of the ocean that passes no judgment on those of us using the warm sand as a napping place — until we start up again. The grand finale is an uninhibited celebration fueled by rum soca music and the desire to ""get on bad."" In other words to simply be free.

Over the past seven years I've celebrated Carnival in Trinidad Barbados Bermuda the Cayman Islands Anguilla Grenada and London. Every time the sense of freedom I feel only grows stronger. Back at home in Los Angeles things are framed in relation to time: work deadlines restaurant reservations phone calls. But during Carnival there is no beginning or end. There are no dress codes formalities or penalties for showing up exactly as you are.

During Carnival there is no beginning or end. There are no penalties for showing up exactly as you are.

While outsiders might see only scanty costumes Carnival is rooted in historical rebellion. In the 18th century enslaved West Africans and freed Blacks in Trinidad were banned from joining the masquerade balls held by French plantation owners leading up to Lent. So out in the fields they drew on their various cultures — and their ingenuity — to create their own celebration called Canboulay around the harvesting and burning of sugarcane.

Since Trinidadian emancipation in 1838 Canboulay has evolved into what we know as Carnival. Those famous parades are inspired by the historical masquerades now known as mas. (The organized groups that participate are known as bands.) And then there's J'Ouvert or ""daybreak"" in Creole. It marks the official beginning of Carnival and is perhaps the most defiant celebration of all. During this sacred ritual I wake up before the sun and join thousands of revelers already gathered in the streets. We wear shower caps and bandannas and clothing we don't mind getting messy. Very messy. By the time day breaks I am euphoric covered in glitter and likely a few splashes of rum. The cowbells and steel drums the neon paint and powder the loose chains hanging from bodies and the devil horns on heads — these are all symbols of a once-enslaved people taking freedom into their own hands.

This feeling of breaking free is so magnetic that today Carnival is celebrated on nearly every Caribbean island by the diaspora in London and New York and at Caribbean-style events as far away as Japan. Just as every island has its own unique identity no two Carnivals look exactly alike. My first Carnival experience in Grenada where Jab Jab culture takes center stage was visceral and powerful. Jab is Grenadian patois from the French diable (""devil"") and the attire worn during J'Ouvert there — thick chains goat horns and black oil — is a satirical representation of the oppression of slavery. The celebration in nearby Barbados called Crop Over comes not before Lent but in late summer — when enslaved Africans whose forced labor made rum so profitable to the island would mark the end of the sugarcane season. Today the three-month-long celebration is one of the most popular in the world even bringing Rihanna home to join in.

For me nothing is more powerful than the music that fuels Carnival: soca a cousin of calypso that fuses East Indian and African sounds created in the 1970s by musician Garfield Blackman (a.k.a. Lord Shorty). Its hypnotizing rhythms have inspired dance styles that encourage (and often require) a looseness in the body throwing the waistline in movements with names like winin' and wukkin' up and yes even the splits. The lyrics are powerful chants that become booming echoes at every fete. In the words of Freetown Collective and DJ Private Ryan in their song ""Feel the Love"": We are such a blessed tribe/Sweeter than a million bees/People live a thousand lives/And never feel this free.

A partygoer at Trinidad's 2020 celebration before the onset of the pandemic. Tarique Eastman

There's a word in Carnival culture tabanca: a longing for celebration so visceral that one feels physically sick. Such withdrawals are shared widely each year both in song lyrics and on social media. But this year the tabanca cure will never come. Trinidad's 2021 Carnival was canceled due to rising COVID-19 cases. That joy and camaraderie and winin' are only a memory for now. Virtual events have made for a new type of connection but there is still nothing sweeter to me than the sound of feet pounding against pavement in unison under the Caribbean sun. So until the next Carnival we wait — and we remember what freedom feels like.

A Part of Carnival History

When one reads back on Carnival Cruise Line’s history it connects on many levels with the American Dream. It started with Mardi Gras which ran aground on its maiden voyage and TSS Carnivale’s launch only three years later. However the company’s expansion started in earnest in 1985 with the launch of 46052-ton Holiday and the so-called Holiday Class of ships.

The Holiday Class ships would help Carnival Cruise Line grow into what it is today. A multi-billion dollar conglomerate that sails more cruise ships to more places than any other company in history.

This growth wouldn’t have happened without the success story that is Carnival’s MS Holiday.

MS Holiday– A Rich History Of Cruising

MS Holiday sailed for Carnival Cruise Line for 24 years. Built-in Denmark in the 1980s by Aalborg Vaerft she sailed for the first time on July 13 1985. She was joined by the MS Jubilee and MS Celebration in 1986 and 1987.

The Holiday class ships’ launch was sparking a cruise boom which saw Carnival Cruise Line become the “Most Popular Cruise Line in the World” carrying more passengers than any other.

Although many great holidays were had onboard MS Holiday famously was part of the relief efforts after Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans and used as temporary housing for the victims of the storm. After 24-years of faithful service mostly in the Caribbean she was transferred to Ibero Cruises in 2009.

The vessel was renamed Grand Holiday and sailed for the now-defunct IberoCruceros. Iberocruceros was never a great success for Carnival Corporation as it ceased operation in 2014 after only 11 years of service.

As IberoCruceros ceased operating British cruise operator Cruise and Maritime Voyages stepped in to take over the vessel and renamed her MV Magellan. She sailed with CMV until the company also went into administration in the middle of last year.

Bought in an auction by Greek operator Seajets she never made it far. The company opting to sell the vessel for scrap instead of letting her have one more go at being a cruise ship.

Economic Effects Causing Havoc

Today January 30 2021 her story of being one of the most influential cruise ships in the world came to a sad end on a beach in India. She joins many others that have also not survived the economic effects the pandemic is having on the cruise industry.

In the last few months we have seen Carnival Imagination Carnival Inspiration and Carnival Fantasy scrapped in Turkey while another Iconic Carnival Ship the MS Tropicale was also scrapped in India.

Other former Cruise and Maritime Voyages ships have also been scrapped recently the iconic MS Marco Polo was also beached at the ship-breaking facility in Alang India alongside the MV Astor.

With many more ships already beached at shipbreakers around the world and no end in sight for the pandemic unfortunately these ships will likely not be the last ones to be beached as scrap metal.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMitgFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVhZHZvY2F0ZS5jb20vYWNhZGlhbmEvZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudF9saWZlL21hcmRpX2dyYXMvY2Fybml2YWwtc2Vhc29uLXJvbGxzLW9uLWluLWd1ZXlkYW4td2l0aC1hbm51YWwtY291cmlyLWFuZC1wYXJhZGUvYXJ0aWNsZV9jOTg4YmVhYy02MzNkLTExZWItOWQ5Ny1iMzVkZWUwNmMwZDMuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Carnival season rolls on in Gueydan with annual courir and parade,"Close Get email notifications on {{subject}} daily!

The airline has also established a technology company.

“THY Cargo is becoming a completely separate company. We plan to incorporate AnadoluJet. We are flying these companies to grow faster pave the way for potential partnerships and acquisitions in the future” Ilker Aycı told reporters Friday as he evaluated the coronavirus pandemic ravaged-2020 and plans for 2021.

“We will have wings flying separately. This is a new era for THY” Aycı stressed. “New partnerships and acquisitions will not come as a surprise. We are already getting partnership offers.”

The CEO said they would decide on the matter of the companies’ initial public offerings (IPO) “on the way.”

The airline industry suffered an unprecedented year in 2020 amid rolling global travel restrictions that brought the movement to a near standstill.

Yet Turkish Airlines’ air cargo brand Turkish Cargo emerged as a bright spot as one of the fastest-growing air cargo brands maintaining operations relentlessly in order not to disrupt the global pharmaceutical supply chain. It was named Europe’s best air cargo brand at the 2020 Air Cargo News Awards in November.

To gain ground at a time when most air passenger operations had ground to a halt the company turned its passenger aircraft into cargo planes. It delivered everything from food aid materials medicine masks and medical equipment worldwide.

According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA) data Turkish Cargo managed to rack up a 0.4% rise in air cargo from January 2020 to October 2020 while the global market volume nosedived by 20.8%.

Turkish Cargo’s market share climbed to 4.7% in the 10-month period from 4.1% in January rising to sixth place in 2020 up from eighth in the January-October 2019 period.

According to figures from World Air Cargo Data (WACD) Turkish Cargo’s income market share grew to 5.3% in January-November up from 4.6% at the beginning of last year.

Aycı also said THY managed to rank sixth in cargo transport in the world in 2020. It ranked third in medical equipment transport he added.

“In response to the increasing demand we have turned the crisis into an opportunity and put 25 cargo aircraft as well as 50 passenger aircraft into operation for freight transport. We also took advantage of our extensive flight network” he noted.

Having the world’s largest direct cargo plane network Turkish Cargo reaches more than 300 destinations 95 of which are direct cargo.

The flag carrier subsidiary transported one out of every 20 air cargoes delivered around the world in 2020 said Aycı. It aims to enter the top three in the world by 2023 as it looks to transport one out of every 10 cargoes in the world.

Carrier with least damage

Aycı said the aviation industry has left what he said was the worst year in the industry’s history pushing the sector back 20 years.

“THY has been an airline company that overcame 2020 with the least damage” he said.

The airline posted a net loss of TL 946 million in the third quarter compared with a profit of TL 3.71 billion a year ago.

Analysts expected the company to log a net loss of TL 1.42 billion for the period in question.

According to analysts deferred tax revenues and grant loan revenues related to increased aircraft and engine purchases were effective in the loss that was below expectations.

Aycı said the new financial data they will be announcing in March would indicate that the company had a better year than its peers.

He stressed they particularly managed their cash flow well noting that they ended 2020 with a cash level near to the one before the 2020 crisis. Ayci pointed out that positive results would come especially in the main activity figures.

The CEO said many airlines saw up to a 50% drop in value due to the pandemic stressing this figure in Turkish Airlines remained at around 10%.

Turkish Airlines was again named Turkey’s most valuable brand in 2020 with a value of nearly $2 billion according to the leading London-based independent branded business valuation consultancy Brand Finance.

Aycı emphasized that the carrier looks to play an important role in vaccine transportation this year. He said the company aims to take advantage of being the company flying to the most destinations and gain an important share of global vaccine transport.

According to the CEO the company is flying all of the vaccines developed so far including BioNTech's COVID-19 vaccine.

“These vaccines have their own packaging and are given to us in special containers. We have the necessary software infrastructure for these transports” Aycı noted.

Aycı also hopes for recovery on the tourism side as he said the fact that Turkey has a strong health infrastructure will provide an advantage this year.

“The rate of spread of the virus is faster than the vaccine. The mutated virus has also raised concerns. Many European countries which are popular in tourism plan not to let in unvaccinated tourists. Because the health infrastructure in these countries is not strong. Some countries are even considering not opening the season this year” Aycı explained

“Turkey’s health infrastructure is very strong. So we are trying to get the greatest share in tourism.”

New firm to sell technology to the world

Acyı said they have established a technology company through which it looks to sell technology to the world.

Ali Serdar Yakut who will be leading the THY Technology and IT Inc. said they would be manufacturing more technology in the field of cargo and logistics and sell those products to the world.

“There are several large companies that offer technology to the aerospace industry. We found that they manipulate us about the price because they were few in number. So we turned the crisis into an opportunity” Yakut noted.

He stressed their technology investments have had a significant impact on THY’s cargo growth.

“We are going to sell the technologies that we were purchasing from outside before. We aim to be one of the largest technology companies in aviation” Yakut said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNWh0dHA6Ly93d3cubmV3cy5jbi9lbmdsaXNoLzIwMjEtMDEvMzAvY18xMzk3MDk3MDQuaHRt0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,China's ZQ-2 carrier rocket completes payload fairing separation test - Xinhua | English.news.cn,"Source: Xinhua| 2021-01-30 21:38:39|Editor: huaxia

HANGZHOU Jan. 30 (Xinhua) -- LandSpace a Chinese private rocket company has completed payload fairing separation test of its ZQ-2 carrier rocket laying a solid foundation for its maiden flight.

The fairing with a diameter of 3.35 meters and a total length of 8.24 meters is separated by split spin-throwing.

The ZQ-2 a medium-scale and low-cost commercial launch vehicle system is independently developed by LandSpace.

The Chinese military have for years boasted of a magic weapon capable of destroying the aircraft carriers from a long range. This magic weapon comes under the category of weapons dubbed the shashoujian or “assassin’s mace” by the PLA. The “assassin’s mace” term is used to designate a wide array of technologies that might afford an inferior military an advantage in a conflict with a superior military power.

In Aug 2020 the Chinese Govt mouthpiece Global Times reported that two “aircraft-carrier killer” missiles or “assassin’s mace” launched by China had travelled thousands of kilometres and hit their designated target a moving ship in the South China Sea. The missiles were reportedly DF-26B and DF-21D missiles and are claimed to have struck a moving ship close to Paracel Islands. A former senior colonel Wang Xiangsui says ‘This is a warning to the US asking it not to take any military risk’

Interestingly the missile launch by China was timed to coincide with the presence of two US Navy aircraft carriers which were exercising in the South China Sea a that time. The Global Times made a typically propaganda bluster declaring that “any aircraft carrier movement in the region is at the pleasure of PLA”.”.

China has a wide selection of anti-aircraft carrier weapons like DF-21D and DF-26 ""aircraft carrier killer"" #missiles. South China Sea is fully within grasp of the #PLA; any US #aircraftcarrier movement in the region is at the pleasure of PLA: analysts. https://t.co/X5L0foka6Q pic.twitter.com/rEPjp9gqAZ — Global Times (@globaltimesnews) July 4 2020

This Chinese bluff was almost immediately called out by the US Navy when it responded that the two aircraft carriers in the region “are not intimidated

And yet there they are. Two @USNavy aircraft carriers operating in the international waters of the South China Sea. #USSNimitz & #USSRonaldReagan are not intimidated #AtOurDiscretion https://t.co/QGTggRjOul — Navy Chief of Information (@chinfo) July 5 2020

The answer to why US Navy confidently called off the Chinese bluff was not very clear to many people at that time. One possible explanation is that the US Navy is aware that while ballistic missiles have the capability to strike a static target with high degree of precision it is not easy to target a moving ship. A missile requires active terminal guidance using a radar or other means to target a moving ship but it is highly unlikely that a Ballistic missile has got such a system. In fact no country in the world has developed such ballistic missiles which can target moving ships. The Chinese claim thus appears to be nothing but an empty bluster to impress its domestic audience.

Whatever little hopes the Chinese had of scaremongering using this “assassin’s mace” have now been destroyed by a test missile firing undertaken on 17 Nov 20. In this test a US navy destroyer shot down a hostile ballistic missile using a SM3 missile.

For the first time last night an @USNavy Aegis Destroyer in the Pacific Ocean shot down a target ICBM.

The area defence capability demonstrated by this test clearly put paid to the Chinese hopes of making South China Sea as ‘Lake China’. The myth of the “assassin’s mace” has thus been given and ignominious sea burial.

China Daily predictably has been rattled by this anti-Ballistic missile test and suggested that this missile is not effective against ‘advanced missiles’. No one is however losing sleep over this mythical “assassin’s mace” and South China Sea remains open as per International conventions.

The incident took place January 17 when the Palau-flagged Arvin broke in half and sunk at a Black Sea anchorage off the Port of Bartin. The 1975-built ship was reported to be carrying 2902 tons of urea.

Sadly this incident did not end well. A day after the ship broke six of the ship’s 12 crew members were still reported missing.

You can hear the captain making the MAYDAY call in the video below.

But subduing Brazil 5000 miles from Paris and with a landmass about the size of all Europe would be a different matter.

In 2035 French marines and paratroopers storm Rio de Janeiro while tanks and infantry invade northern Brazil. These troops are the spearhead of a United Nation military expedition determined to seize the Amazon region and turn it into an international environmental zone.

Is this the latest apocalyptic vision from the Tinfoil Hat Brigade? Has Napoleon risen from the dead?

No this is actually a scenario that Brazil’s military is planning for.

“The Brazilian military elite views France as a strategic threat to Brazil” said Brazil’s Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper which obtained a look at a Brazilian military report. “This stems from France's renewed interest in internationalizing the Amazon.”

The military study titled “Defense Scenarios 2040” examined several potential scenarios in what Folha de Sao Paulo called a mixture of “realistic geopolitical considerations and somewhat delusional hypotheses.” Notably the forecast—based on interviews with 500 senior Brazilian officers—envisioned a scenario in which Southeast Asian ultranationalists incensed by Brazil’s growing strength unleashes the coronavirus against Rio de Janeiro in 2039.

But all these scenarios France is the enemy. In the Amazon invasion for example French forces would operate from French Guiana which shares a 500-mile border with northern Brazil.

Never mind that France has not been a military power in Latin America since the nineteenth century. Current French president Emmanuel Macron suggested in 2019 that the Amazon be internationalized for its own protection after massive wildfires in the region generated air pollution on a global scale. Logging and cattle ranching are steadily eating away at the Amazon rainforest leading to fears that the region will no longer function as a global absorber of carbon which in turn could accelerate global warming.

But Macron’s call for an internationalized Amazon incensed Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro a right-wing former army officer who favors loosening restrictions on private development of the Amazon.

Not surprisingly French diplomats in Brazil derided the “limitless imagination” of the study’s authors. France has been Brazil’s “main military partner” and both nations have enjoyed “a close and friendly relationship for decades conducting joint operations on a daily basis” they pointed out.

“Both countries also have signed major partnership agreements including the construction of submarines and helicopters and exchange over 7 billion euros of goods every year” noted French TV network France24. In 2018 Brazil launched the first of five French Scorpene-class diesel submarines under a $7 billion deal with France signed in 2008. The deal later spurred French authorities to investigate whether bribery was a factor in the sale.

As military adversaries comparing Brazil to France is like comparing mangoes to French fries. The two simply don’t intersect. Brazil actually has the larger military—almost 350000-strong—including several infantry brigades trained for jungle warfare. It also has a substantial domestic arms industry that exports some well-regarded weapons such as the Embraer EMB 314 Super Tucano light attack aircraft which the U.S. military almost purchased. In 2019 Brazil also received its first Swedish Gripen jet fighters. However despite some advanced weaponry Brazil armed forces would not be in France’s league in terms of training or command and control.

France does have nuclear weapons which are useless in an environmental rescue mission (“we had to nuke the Amazon in order to save it”). France has a 200000-strong military with a single nuclear-powered aircraft carrier and a few highly capable airborne special forces and Foreign Legion units capable of minor interventions such as against Islamic rebels in Africa. But subduing Brazil 5000 miles from Paris and with a landmass about the size of all Europe would be a different matter.

Not to mention something called the Monroe Doctrine in which the United States. has made clear since 1823 that invading Latin America by any outside nation—except the United States—is a no-no.

All of which means that the chances of France invading Brazil are about the same as France invading Mexico again as it did in 1861. Whatever happens to the Amazon it won’t be a part of the la gloire of France.

A record 2443 entries were received from amateur photographers in 72 countries during 2020. Each winning photograph captures a moment in the busy and often beautiful lives of insects. People of all ages have been discovering the smaller animals we see around us every day even during the pandemic.

Head judge Dr Tim Cockerill from Falmouth University’s Institute of Photography said “In a year that has been memorable for all the wrong reasons it is wonderful to see how so many people around the world have taken solace in nature"".

“Life has gone on as normal for insects and it’s clear that watching wildlife has been a great comfort to many of us. Every one of the photographs entered into the competition represents someone turning their attention to insects. They are truly fascinating animals and are all around us but often go unnoticed. Photographs like these really allow us to appreciate them and the great many roles they play in nature.”

‘Tractors Versus Tanks!’ newspaper headlines proclaimed after this year’s Republic Day. Thankfully the two didn’t come into direct conflict but the juxtaposition was striking with the Indian Army ’s tanks rolling in the official parade and the tractors of the farmers protesting the new farm laws rumbling and battering their way through Delhi sometimes just a short distance away.Yet tractors and tanks are not as different as those events made them seem. They share a common history which also strikingly interlinks indirectly with a history of Sikh lead protests. The common point is Stockton a city in California that stands at the edge of the fertile Central Valley just before the point where the San Joaquin and Sacramento rivers meet through many waterways to form the California Delta region.Benjamin Holt arrived there in the 1880s to set up a wheel-making company with his brothers. Holt’s interest in wheels lead him to making machines that could be rolled out to work in the regions farms like early versions of combine harvesters and tractors. These were initially horse drawn but then used engines initially steam powered and the using other fuel sources like wood coal and oil.But all these shared one problem – their wheels sank in the moist soil of the Delta. Holt realised that mounting the machines on tracks that the wheels turned in a continuous loop would both provide moving power and by distributing the weight better stop them sinking. In effect the tracks provided their own surface to move on even over rough ground or muddy terrain.There is a lot of controversy over whether Holt devised this solution himself or developed or appropriated concepts others had come up with earlier. But his were clearly the first track mounted machines to become a commercial success and his company also came up with the term ‘caterpillar’ term to describe their movement which he trademarked in 1910. In 1925 the company was renamed Caterpillar Tractors and the name is still used today by the giant Caterpillar Inc. corporation.According to an essay by Reynold M.Wik a historian of agricultural mechanisation published in Agricultural History magazine in 1980 a Hungarian engineer named Leo Steiner was the first to see the battlefield potential of Caterpillar tractors to pull artillery guns. He tried to interest the Autro-Hungarian military in this but they ignored him which would prove to be an immense historical mistake. But even the American military was uninterested when Holt approached them believing that mules were all that were needed for the job.The breakthrough would come with the British. In 1915 after suffering huge losses in the early years of the First World War the British were desperate for inventions that could turn the tide. Artillery guns that could be moved rapidly and without depending on easily killed animals to pull them would be a big advantage but because of their size the men working them were easy targets for the enemy.In July 1914 Colonel E.D.Swinton a British officer who had been born in Bangalore and served in the Boer war received a letter from Hugh Marriott a mining engineer named he knew from South Africa. Marriott described a Caterpillar tractor he had seen in Antwerp and Swinton realised that this could be the basis for a fully armoured vehicle that could operate in rough terrain and carry a mounted gun. This became the basis for the first tanks and they would provide the British with a crucial advantage in the battles to come.Holt’s company provide 2100 track mounted tractors to the British armed forces and in 1918 Swinton visited Stockton to express their appreciation. He told Caterpillar’s workers that their tractors lead to the tanks that were vital to winning the war. Later on they would be used for bulldozers that would become crucial in World War II . Wik writes that “Admiral William F.Halsey in 1945 stated that the four machines which won the war in the Pacific were the submarine the airplane radar and the tractor bulldozer.”Stockton is also where the Sikhs come in. Between 1899 and 1914 an estimated 6800 South Asians came to the American West mostly Sikh farmers from the Punjab  though a few Punjabi Muslims and Hindus also came. They were driven by the same problems of falling farm sizes and rising debts that bedevil the farmers today and they heard of the fertile lands of California where their skills could be used. They settled around the Central Valley and Stockton was where they built the first gurdwara in the USA which opened in 1912.These Sikh farmers would definitely have used Holt’s tractors but their interests weren’t limited to farming. Jawala Singh who became a successful potato farmer and one of the founders of the Gurdwara Sahib Stockton would also become one of the founders of the Ghadar Party a movement of expatriate Indians to protest British rule in India and work for revolution. Ghadar was one of the first modern examples of Punjabi lead political protest and it shows how far back the potent links between Sikh farmers tractors and even tanks can reach.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vYXJjaGl2ZXMxLnN1bmRheW9ic2VydmVyLmxrLzIwMjEvMDEvMzEvYnVzaW5lc3MvZmF3LWNhdGVycGlsbGFyLWF0dGFja3MtbG9zcy1tYWl6ZS1leGNlZWRzLTI2MDAwLWhh0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,FAW caterpillar attacks: Loss to maize exceeds 26000 ha,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='archives1.sundayobserver.lk', port=443): Read timed out.

FOUNDED: 2008

HEADQUARTERS: Santa Monica

CEO: Robert Kotick

BUSINESS: Video gaming

EMPLOYEES: 9200 (Q4 2019)

MARKET CAP: $72.2 billion

REVENUE: $1.95 billion (Q3 2020)



NEED TO KNOW: Long before 2008 when Activision Blizzard Inc. formed out of the merger of Activision Inc. and Vivendi Games Los Angeles was a major hub for the video game industry. The combination of these gaming leaders created an industry juggernaut and what is now one of the most valuable companies in L.A.



Video games surged in popularity last year and Activision Blizzard reaped the benefits with revenue for the first three quarters of 2020 up 26% over the same period in 2019.



In the year’s final quarter Activision Blizzard released new titles in its signature “Call of Duty” and “World of Warcraft” series and in January the company’s market capitalization hit an all-time high.



The game publisher found success over the last two years with mobile and free-to-play versions of popular games like “Call of Duty.” In an October earnings call Chief Executive Robert Kotick said this would be a key part of the company’s efforts to maximize the popularity of its valuable franchises.



Kotick also said the company is looking for new ways to capitalize on the success of “Candy Crush” the addictive mobile game Activision Blizzard added to its list of franchises with the 2016 acquisition of King Digital Entertainment.



QUOTABLE: “As the community engages they consume more content” Kotick said. “More players are purchasing premium content than ever before and these growth rates highlight the tremendous power of the combination of our premium and free-to-play business model.”

Snap Inc.

FOUNDED: 2011

HEADQUARTERS: Santa Monica

CEO: Evan Spiegel

BUSINESS: Social media

EMPLOYEES: 3195 (Q4 2019)

MARKET CAP: $79.9 billion

REVENUE: $679 million (Q3 2020)



NEED TO KNOW: Gone are the days when investors worried about Snap Inc.’s disappointing initial public offering and wondered whether the company’s signature mobile app Snapchat would lose users to Instagram. Snap’s value more than doubled in 2020 as the company rolled out new features and expanded its library of original games and streaming content.



In the third quarter of 2020 Snap reported a user growth rate of 18% year over year and a revenue total more than 50% higher than the same period a year earlier Snap then took on rival TikTok directly with the launch of a feature called Spotlight which allows users to share short videos publicly and to collect monetary rewards when clips go viral.



Chief Executive Evan Spiegel said the company’s solid growth numbers stem from a focus on development of new user features and assuring solid returns on investment for advertisers.



In its quest to develop more in-app features Snap has partnered with third-party software developers and startups many of them based in the L.A. area. In 2018 the company launched an incubator for budding creators of digital content. Last year Snap rolled out another program called Yellow Collabs in which participating companies worked with Snap to design new features and tools for app users.



QUOTABLE: “The revenue and community growth we have generated as a result of these efforts has afforded us the opportunity to double down and innovate even more especially around our camera and augmented reality platform” Spiegel said on a call with investors.

Google

PARENT COMPANY: Alphabet Inc.

FOUNDED: 1998

LARGEST L.A. OFFICE: Playa Vista

CEO: Sundar Pichai

BUSINESS: Internet services

L.A. EMPLOYEES: Approximately 1000

NEED TO KNOW: All of the “big five” tech companies have offices in the Los Angeles area but Google is poised to be a major player locally once employees return to physical office locations.



Google and its parent company Alphabet Inc. already had a significant Silicon Beach presence in 2018 when it added 450000 square feet of office space in a converted Playa Vista airplane hangar that once housed Howard Hughes’ enormous Spruce Goose aircraft.



Only a few months later Google signed a lease to take over most of the former Westside Pavilion shopping mall in West Los Angeles. The company is tentatively expected to move into the nearly 600000-square-foot space in 2022 though Google reportedly told employees last year that its offices won’t reopen until September 2021 at the earliest.



By expanding its presence in Los Angeles Google is putting itself in a good position to capitalize on the high volume of future tech employees produced by local colleges and universities. Only three other U.S. cities — New York; Washington D.C.; and Boston — produce more tech degrees annually according to a CBRE Group Inc. report released last summer.



QUOTABLE: Mayor Eric Garcetti has touted Google’s Los Angeles presence as a key contributor to the growth of the city’s tech sector. “This investment in our city our economy and our people helps L.A. continue to create tech jobs faster than any other city in America” he said when Google opened its Playa Vista office.

Riot Games Inc.

PARENT COMPANY: Tencent Holdings Ltd.

FOUNDED: 2006

HEADQUARTERS: Sawtelle

CEO: Nicolo Laurent

BUSINESS: Video gaming

EMPLOYEES: 2500

NEED TO KNOW: It may not be obvious to casual observers but Riot Games is at the heart of a rapidly growing esports industry for which Los Angeles is the U.S. capital.



The video game publisher released its first title “League of Legends” in 2009 and has spent more than a decade developing a now-massive fanbase around the game and the players who compete in it professionally.



Livestreams of the 2020 League of Legends World Championship in Shanghai garnered more than 45 million peak concurrent viewers according to Riot Games.



The company last year launched a new game “Valorant” as well as a league of professional teams to foster an esports fan base around the title. Even before its official release the game attracted more than 3 million daily players in a testing period the company said.



Riot’s success has buoyed other Los Angeles companies in the esports industry including the owners of professional franchises like SoloMid Corp. broadcasters such as Super League Gaming Inc. and amateur competition organizer Play Versus Inc.



QUOTABLE: “Our Platform Group has built the infrastructure needed to take us from a single game on a single platform to a limitless future with multiple games across multiple platforms all able to interact with each other seamlessly” said Riot Chief Operating Officer Scott Gelb last year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jb3VyaWVybWFpbC5jb20uYXUvYnVzaW5lc3MvY3VzaG1hbi13YWtlZmllbGQtbG9zZS1zZXZlbi1hZ2VudHMtYmVmb3JlLWNocmlzdG1hcy9uZXdzLXN0b3J5L2JiZWEwMDMzYTViNGQxYWJmYjc0NTQ3YzI2NjE2ODAw0gGMAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvdXJpZXJtYWlsLmNvbS5hdS9idXNpbmVzcy9jdXNobWFuLXdha2VmaWVsZC1sb3NlLXNldmVuLWFnZW50cy1iZWZvcmUtY2hyaXN0bWFzL25ld3Mtc3RvcnkvYmJlYTAwMzNhNWI0ZDFhYmZiNzQ1NDdjMjY2MTY4MDA_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mass exodus from major real estate agency,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.couriermail.com.au/business/cushman-wakefield-lose-seven-agents-before-christmas/news-story/bbea0033a5b4d1abfb74547c26616800 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jb3VyaWVybWFpbC5jb20uYXUvYnVzaW5lc3MvY3VzaG1hbi13YWtlZmllbGQtbG9zZS1zZXZlbi1hZ2VudHMtYmVmb3JlLWNocmlzdG1hcy9uZXdzLXN0b3J5L2JiZWEwMDMzYTViNGQxYWJmYjc0NTQ3YzI2NjE2ODAw0gGMAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvdXJpZXJtYWlsLmNvbS5hdS9idXNpbmVzcy9jdXNobWFuLXdha2VmaWVsZC1sb3NlLXNldmVuLWFnZW50cy1iZWZvcmUtY2hyaXN0bWFzL25ld3Mtc3RvcnkvYmJlYTAwMzNhNWI0ZDFhYmZiNzQ1NDdjMjY2MTY4MDA_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

Despite opposition from many of the state’s leading medical groups Oklahoma will outsource care for most of the state’s Medicaid recipients to for-profit health care companies.

Gov. Kevin Stitt and state health leaders announced Friday the Oklahoma Health Care Authority will contract with four companies to manage care for more than 700000 Medicaid beneficiaries in what will be a major overhaul of Oklahoma’s Medicaid program.

The agency will spend up to $2.2 billion to privatize the state’s Medicaid program through what is commonly referred to as a managed-care model.

The companies will be paid based on set rates that factor in the number of members enrolled each month. The contracts among the largest ever awarded in state history will be in effect for one year with renewal options thereafter.

Touting the change in a news conference Stitt pointed to the 40 other states that have implemented Medicaid managed care and criticized Oklahoma’s history of poor health outcomes.

“Oklahomans deserve better and we’re going to get better” he said. “A healthy Oklahoma is a prosperous Oklahoma. As leaders we have a moral obligation to make life better for the people that we serve. Business as usual will not make us a Top 10 state.”

The following companies were selected through a public bidding process:

• Blue Cross Blue Shield of Oklahoma

• Humana Healthy Horizons

• Oklahoma Complete Health a subsidiary of Centene Corp.

• United Healthcare

But the managed care plan pushed by Stitt faces opposition from some Republican and Democratic legislators and members of the medical community.

In a statement the Oklahoma State Medical Association Oklahoma Osteopathic Association and the Oklahoma chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics said the state’s prior attempt with managed care was disastrous and resulted in many physicians being forced to stop seeing Medicaid patients.

Since the 1990s Oklahoma has tried several times to implement managed care to varying degrees of success. State health officials have said managed care will look dramatically different this time around.

“It is unfortunate that rather than working with stakeholders and legislators on his managed care scheme this administration has chosen to push through an ill-conceived plan that will have serious implications for our state’s most vulnerable and at-risk populations” said Dr. Woody Jenkins of Stillwater. “Real leadership involves more than buzzwords and partisan talking points. It requires dialogue and compromise two things that have been sorely lacking during this process.”

The Oklahoma Hospital Association Oklahoma Dental Association Oklahoma Pharmacists Association and Oklahoma Medical Equipment Providers Association also oppose managed care.

Proponents of managed care say if patients get more coordinated care like regular primary care visits and preventative care more severe and potentially costly health problems can be caught early or avoided altogether. If the managed care companies are successful in driving down costs they will profit from the state contracts.

""A managed care delivery model will allow the state to improve these outcomes for Oklahomans improve access to prevention and treatment services through better care service and coordination all while increasing cost predictability in the state of Oklahoma"" said Health Care Authority CEO Kevin Corbett.

Managed care seeks to maximize health care quality while stabilizing or cutting costs. Critics say cutting costs is detrimental to goals of improving health care.

Stitt has come under fire from some lawmakers for not involving the Oklahoma Legislature in what will be drastic changes for the state's Medicaid program.

Senate Minority Leader Kay Floyd D-Oklahoma City expressed concerns about managed care this week.

""The Legislature’s a coequal branch of government"" she said. ""To make these kinds of major policy shifts to implement Medicaid without having input from the Legislature we feel is ill-advised.""

A proponent of managed care Senate Majority Floor Leader Kim David R-Porter said the switch will result in more than 1000 new jobs in Oklahoma although she did not cite specifics. Corbett said he doesn't anticipate any cuts among personnel at the Health Care Authority due to the change.

The insurance companies will manage care for the following Medicaid populations: Roughly 200000 Oklahomans who will be covered under Medicaid expansion children pregnant women parent and caretaker relatives former foster children and juveniles in foster care.

When a split Oklahoma Health Care Authority board voted this week to allow the agency to sign off on managed care contracts one board member expressed concerns that a losing bidder may lodge a protest against the agency. Board member Tanya Case who expressed opposition to managed care cited a recent protest filed against the Health Care Authority's contract with software company Orion Health to build a state health information exchange.

The Health Care Authority intends to implement managed care on Oct. 1. The contracts with these health care companies are contingent upon funding from the Legislature.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Justin Sullivan | Getty Images

Every time someone accesses the internet through their smartphone their wireless carrier transmits that data through the airwaves on frequencies that only it has the license to use. In the coming weeks licenses to use some of of the most valuable frequencies will be assigned to the highest bidder. Whoever wins will almost certainly use them to build out a faster more powerful 5G network changing the competitive dynamics of the telecom industry. Earlier this month the Federal Communications Commission announced that bidders have bid $80.9 billion on 280 megahertz of airwave licenses or spectrum in what's referred to as Auction 107. After 97 rounds of bidding the total was significantly higher than the $20 billion to $30 billion range most outside observers predicted last summer and underscores how critical this auction is for telecom companies. ""Once these 5G networks deployed on this mid-band spectrum are rolled out the performance jump is going to be so dramatic that if carriers are not in that game they're going to get left behind"" said Doug Brake broadband policy director at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation a think tank. The winners of the auction aren't public yet. Verizon AT&T T-Mobile and other parties involved in the auction are in a quiet period where they can't comment until it's final and down payments have been paid. A notice issued by the FCC on Jan. 26 reminded applicants that they can't legally talk about any non-public information such as who's won or lost. The FCC also said the auction is entering a second phase in which the winners will get to pick the exact regions and blocks of spectrum they want. The bidders have won licenses but the specific assignments aren't final yet. The results are expected to be released in a few weeks.

The auction is a big deal for Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T the big three U.S. wireless companies. All three are in the process of building out 5G networks. The FCC is involved in spectrum allocation to prevent interference or when two groups are using the same wavelengths at the same time making it less effective. That's why the FCC is running this auction which is intended to make sure that the groups that win have the capital to actually use the spectrum. Most of the proceeds go to the U.S. Treasury. Not all wavelengths are created equal. The highest frequencies only travel short distances but can transmit huge amounts of data with recent advancements in antennas and modems. The lowest frequencies can travel long distances but are less well-suited for pumping large amounts of data. The C-Band wavelengths that are up for auction are in the middle. It's actually called mid-band spectrum. Some call it ""goldilocks spectrum"" — as in it's just right for 5G. Verizon  the current U.S. leader in mobile subscribers doesn't have much mid-band spectrum. It's tried to make up for it with its ""ultra wideband"" 5G that promises to download 4K movies in seconds but those waves don't travel far. It's like a wi-fi hotspot. But if Verizon wins this auction it could build a network that's faster than the current 4G networks and doesn't require the company to build towers on every block. ""If you're Verizon you now have the opportunity to get the spectrum you need because you don't want to lose the beachhead of being perceived as the leading company. They kind of dominated the LTE or the 4G world"" said Walt Piecyk co-founder of LightShed Partners which closely follows spectrum auctions. ""Are you going to let T-Mobile or even AT&T take over the mantle as being the 5G network of choice?"" T-Mobile acquired licenses for a different block of mid-band spectrum through its merger with Sprint. So it doesn't need to win this auction as much as Verizon does. But it's still expected to be a bidder for a variety of reasons. If it wins that means that its rivals didn't. Even if it doesn't win bidding could increase the price. AT&T needs to win too. But it has been spending a lot in recent years. In 2018 it paid over $85 billion for Time Warner which included HBO. This spectrum would also be a large purchase but at the same time AT&T also needs mid-band spectrum to build the wireless network that powers its cash flow. Raymond James analyst Frank Louthan said in a note earlier this month that if AT&T spends $23 billion on spectrum its balance sheet could ""spook investors."" Cable companies like Comcast  Charter and Cox are also registered to bid. Charter and Comcast formed a joint venture called C&C Wireless Holding Company to bid on the frequencies. But the spectrum is less strategic for broadband companies and they are less likely to pay eye watering prices for it. One wildcard is Dish  whose chairman Charlie Ergen has shown a proclivity for snapping up spectrum and bidding up prices in the past. That's not every possible winner out of the 74 entities that registered to bid in the auction but those are the big ones. No big tech companies publicly registered to bid. There's an outside possibility that a tech giant has been quietly participating in the auction through one of the entities but that's very unlikely said Piecyk.

The CEOs of Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. spoke last year about combining the two U.S.-based oil giants the Wall Street Journal reported Jan. 31 citing unnamed sources.

Chevron CEO Mike Wirth and Exxon Mobil CEO Darren Woods spoke shortly after the coronavirus pandemic took hold according to people familiar with the talks. The discussions were described as “preliminary and aren’t ongoing but could come back in the future” the Wall Street Journal report said.

The talks were serious enough for legal documents involving certain aspects of the merger discussions to be drafted one of the sources said according to the report. The reason the talks ended was not disclosed.

UPDATE:

Analysts: Chevron Merger Buzz a Sideshow Before Exxon Mobil Loss

If true the combination would form the world’s second largest oil company by market cap and production second in both measures to Saudi Aramco. The Wall Street Journal reported the combined company’s market value toping $350 billion and production of about 7 million bbl/d of oil and gas based on pre-pandemic levels.

Additionally a deal between Exxon Mobil and Chevron would reunite the two largest descendants of John D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil monopoly.

One of the sources in the report said that the CEOs of Exxon Mobil and Chevron envisioned achieving synergies through massive cost cuts to help weather the downturn in energy markets. At the end of 2019 Exxon Mobil employed about 75000 people and Chevron roughly 48000.

Last year Chevron went on to acquire U.S.-based independent oil producer Noble Energy in a $5 billion all-stock deal that was completed in October.

NEW YORK--The chief executives of ExxonMobil Corp and Chevron Corp held preliminary talks in early 2020 to explore combining the two largest U.S. oil producers in what would have been the biggest merger of all time according to people familiar with the matter.



The discussions which are no longer active are indicative of the pressure the energy sector's most dominant companies faced as the COVID-19 pandemic took hold and crude prices plunged.

The talks between Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods and Chevron CEO Mike Wirth were serious enough for legal documents involving certain aspects of the merger discussions to be drafted one of the sources said. The reason the talks ended could not be learned.

The sources requested anonymity because the matter is confidential. Exxon and Chevron which have market capitalizations of $190 billion and $164 billion respectively declined to comment.

Exxon and Chevron's shares nosedived last year after a Saudi-Russian price war and fallout from the novel coronavirus outbreak caused the value of oil to crater. Exxon's stock was hit hardest as investors raised concerns about the company's long-term profitability and spending decisions.

In their talks the CEOs of Exxon and Chevron envisioned achieving synergies through massive cost cuts to help weather the downturn in energy markets one of the sources said. At the end of 2019 Exxon employed about 75000 people and Chevron roughly 48000.

Following the aborted talks with Exxon Chevron went on to acquire oil producer Noble Energy in a $5 billion cash-and-stock deal that was completed in October.

A proposed combination last year would almost certainly have triggered an intense antitrust review by the U.S. Justice Department a process that typically takes months to complete. And such a review would also potentially have run up against last November's U.S. presidential election raising additional uncertainty about how soon such a deal might be cleared if at all.

Now under the Biden administration the window might be all but closed as Democrats historically have been less sympathetic to such deals one of the sources said. President Joe Biden has put climate change at the forefront of his agenda promoting jobs in renewable energy as opposed to traditional ones in the oil sector.

Biden recently formally revoked the permit to build the Keystone XL oil pipeline. General Motors last week said it would aim to stop selling vehicles powered by gasoline and diesel which rely on oil by 2035.

The White House and Justice Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

News of the unsuccessful talks emerged as Exxon has come under pressure from some of its shareholders over its strategic direction. Engine No. 1 a investment firm based in San Francisco last week nominated four directors to Exxon’s board and is pushing the company to spend its cash better preserve its dividend and invest more in clean energy. Exxon is also in the crosshairs of hedge fund D.E. Shaw which is pressuring the company to cut costs and improve performance."

Chipotle Mexican Grill’s newest Florida ""Chipotlane"" — a regular Chipotle with the added convenience of a drive-through lane — will open in Casselberry in early 2022.

Patrons can place orders via Chipotle’s website or mobile app and pick up their food at a Chipotlane location without entering the store. By early 2022 one hopes the pandemic will be under control enough that contactless pickup won't be necessary but it will still be more convenient than standing in line.

The Chipotlane concept was announced by the Newport Beach California company in 2017. The first in Florida opened in Kissimmee in late 2019. A press release from the company says Chipotlanes are becoming more common among new locations — in the third quarter of 2020 more than half of the 44 new Chipotle restaurants included a drive-through.

According to the Orlando Business Journal groundbreaking is expected to happen in November 2021.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzAxLzMxL21jZG9uYWxkcy1ib3VuY2VzLWJhY2stdG8tZ3Jvd3RoL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,McDonald's Bounces Back to Growth,"The chain just barely managed its seventh consecutive year of growth in the U.S. market.

McDonald's (MCD -0.67%) just closed the books on a forgettable year for the business. COVID-19 continued to sink customer traffic across its global portfolio of stores through the end of 2020 the fast-food giant said in its recent earnings report.

Yet McDonald's notched a few wins that point to a better 2021 ahead assuming the pandemic threat fades over the next few months.

Let's take a closer look.

Growing in the U.S.

McDonald's steady rebound continued in the three months that ended in late December. Comparable-store sales were down just 1% globally compared to a 2% drop last quarter and a 25% slump in fiscal Q2. Declining revenue isn't normally a cause for celebration but management highlighted several bright spots in a tough year.

These include the fact that sales landed in modestly positive territory in the core U.S. market thanks to a quick shift to a drive-thru and home delivery focus. That result kept the chain ahead of peer Starbucks for the year but trailing Chipotle Mexican Grill. ""2020 will be remembered as one of McDonald's most challenging ... moments in our long history"" CEO Chris Kempczinski said in a press release.

Earnings are down

The earnings picture is less encouraging and reflects the depth of the chain's operating slump in 2020. Profits in Q4 fell 9% after excluding currency exchange rate shifts and were down 20% for the full year. That metric trailed McDonald's revenue trend thanks to extra costs related to COVID-19 safety and elevated marketing spending aimed at supporting franchisees.

The fast-food industry has become more competitive in recent months as national chains fight over pieces of a flat market.

McDonald's finances endured a COVID-19 hit but they're still strong. Operating cash flow declined by roughly $2 billion in 2020 yet was solidly positive at $6.3 billion.

The chain continued spending cash on its growth initiatives like store remodels product launches and delivery. ""By investing for the future and leveraging competitive strengths we're confident we can continue to capture market share and drive long-term sustainable growth"" Kempczinski said.

Looking ahead

Management didn't issue a forecast for the new fiscal year but McDonald's is likely to report significant growth this year. The fiscal first quarter which started a few weeks ago is up against a prior-year period that included significant early impacts from the pandemic. Comps dove 13% in the U.S. in March last year and fell 35% in the company's core international segments. Both areas should see significant improvements when compared to those slumps.

The big question is when the chain can get back to setting sales and earnings records again on an absolute basis. Continued modest improvements like the one the chain just announced would mean McDonald's could reach that revenue mark in 2021. The profit rebound will take longer.

That means shareholders should brace for a volatile period ahead for the business and for the stock until the rebound path looks clearer by late 2021.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5hbHBoYXN0cmVldC5jb20vZWFybmluZ3MtY2FsZW5kYXItZm9yLXRoZS13ZWVrLW9mLWZlYnJ1YXJ5LTEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Earnings calendar for the week of February 1,"In a week that saw one of the worst stock selloffs Gamestop came under spotlight after the stock experienced unprecedented fluctuations marked by a 10-fold spike in value followed by a sharp retreat.

For the second time in less than two months Latter-day Saint women have taken to social media to push back against an address delivered by a top female church leader.

Speaking on Friday at Brigham Young University’s Women’s Conference President Camille Johnson leader of the global Relief Society of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints encouraged women to rely on the words of President Russell M. Nelson and emphasized the need for women to prioritize motherhood.

“My primary orientation — that is my focus passion and calling as a woman — is toward motherhood” Johnson a former corporate lawyer said. “That is our primary orientation our sacred calling as daughters of Heavenly Parents.”

The Salt Lake Tribune submitted questions to a church spokesperson for the 60-year-old Johnson including how she and her husband managed child care while they both worked and her advice for Latter-day Saint women interested in pursuing a career but who feel guilty for doing so. No responses were provided.

“I had babies and my husband and I loved and nurtured them while we were both working” Johnson told her worldwide audience Friday. “It was busy sometimes hectic. We were stretched and sometimes tired. I supported him and he supported me. Family was and still is our top priority.”

Senior apostle Dallin Oaks Nelson’s top counselor in the governing First Presidency and next in line to lead the 17.2 million-member faith spoke on similar themes in a 2023 devotional. The 91-year-old father of six warned young single adults against delaying marriage and childbearing even for financial reasons.

He was among the first to comment on the church’s Instagram post quoting Johnson’s talk calling the Relief Society president a “wonderful role model.”

(The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) President Dallin H. Oaks of the First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and wife Kristen speak to young adults at a worldwide devotional broadcast in May 2023. The couple urged young adults to stop delaying marriage and parenthood.

Some commenters however worried the call to prioritize motherhood could leave women particularly vulnerable to financial insecurity.

“Approaching 40 I have seen enough faithful LDS women abandoned by their husbands and left to care for their children — all with weak educational degrees starting from scratch and barely scraping by” wrote @anniemangelson. “Too many women and children end up in absolute crisis having simply ‘followed the prophet.’ We have to quit teaching like this and setting some women up for failure.”

And as many commenters pointed out Johnson’s own decision to pursue a career conflicted with previous prophetic counsel discouraging women from work that took them away from their husbands and children.

“I’m grateful for this message and example” said user @jsmileybug. “However I’m 25 and this is the very first time I’ve EVER heard a church leader suggest it’s acceptable for [mothers] to work outside the home.”

What Kimball and Benson said

(The Salt Lake Tribune_ President Spencer W Kimball of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints sits with apostle Ezra Taft Benson. Both leaders urged women to put motherhood ahead of careers.

Some of the more than 2000 comments pointed to the words of former President Spencer W. Kimball spoken in 1977 and shared a decade later during a Brigham Young University fireside by then-President Ezra Taft Benson as the kind of clear direction Johnson would have heard — and not heeded.

“No career approaches in importance that of wife homemaker mother — cooking meals washing dishes making beds for one’s precious husband and children” Benson quoted Kimball as saying. “Come home wives to your husbands. Make home a heaven for them. Come home wives to your children born and unborn.

Several Instagram commenters cited rhetoric like this as their own reason for forfeiting careers and instead having children sooner than they otherwise would have — decisions some said they now regretted. To have Johnson who chose otherwise now lauded as a role model they said was painful to watch.

One user @oils4us wrote that she was in the audience when Benson delivered his dramatic address. Taking the message to heart she said she proceeded to give birth to three children in three years.

“I used to get the BYU alumni magazine and every time I’d cry and feel sad because where was my paragraph?” she wrote. “Where were my accolades for having done what” Benson instructed?

Seeing Johnson praised now she said brought back that same ache.

“The women” she said “who went against the prophet’s very direct counsel get their paragraphs and fulfillment of becoming something else and a mom.”

Neither was the impact of such rhetoric constrained to a single generation.

“I’m sobbing reading this” commented the 35-year-old Linda Hamilton who in an interview with The Tribune said she gave up her dream of becoming a writer to devote herself to her family.

These days she mourns “for younger me. She gave up all her dreams and ambitions because she truly thought God would only accept her if she obeyed the prophets exactly.”

It’s not that Hamilton who lives in Southern California doesn’t want the church to celebrate working women. Rather she wishes Johnson and other church leaders would acknowledge that doing so represents a major break from the past.

Hamilton is hardly alone.

The ‘right thing to do’

(The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) Relief Society General President Camille Johnson speaks at the European Union Parliament in Brussels in March 2024 on religious liberty for women.

“This would have been an even more beautiful message if it was coupled with an apology” wrote @ariabethards “to all the women who listened to President Benson and other prophets who pressured women into letting go of education and career dreams to stay home as housewives.”

Others meanwhile didn’t seem to know what to think in response to the talk.

“I’m starting to feel so confused” wrote @jameeandelin. “On the one hand I’m so happy that Camille Johnson listened to her own intuition and authority to make decisions for her life. …But I know someone who was not given a temple recommend because they chose to work instead of stay at home at the time. It’s so unfair. I don’t get it.”

Still others saw in the sermon an opportunity to emphasize the importance of following Johnson’s example and carving one’s own path.

“Let this celebratory post of a woman in the church choosing to go against the brethren” @edge_of_inside wrote “stand as a shining example to the rest of us that following our own personal revelation and authority will always be the right thing to do.”

The comments are reminiscent of the more than 13000 responses engendered by a church Instagram post from late March quoting a sermon by Johnson’s first counselor J. Anette Dennis.

In her speech and the associated post Dennis stated “There is no other religious organization in the world that I know of that has so broadly given power and authority to women.”

The women represented in the comments were less convinced arguing that their experience in the patriarchal faith did not align with Dennis’ description.

Plans for a food village showcasing local produce and traders in the grounds of a church during the Isle of Man TT race festival have been thrown out.

The idea was put forward by the Manx Food Market Traders Association which organises food markets on North Quay.

It would have been held in the grounds of St Ninian’s Church in Douglas between 27 May and 8 June.

But the planning committee rejected the application amid concerns over increased traffic parking issues noise odour and the effect on the existing food offering at the grandstand during the period.

The association had put forward plans for one-sided marquees food trucks and street food vendors accompanied by musical entertainment with a pop-up fine dining restaurant in the eaves of the church in the evening.

Resident concerns

In its objection to the plans the Department for Enterprise said there was already due to be “significant food offerings” at the grandstand during the festival but would have supported the village had it been in the town centre.

The DfE also said traffic would be “directed along and away” from the area to alleviate the issues raised by residents previously but holding the food festival may exacerbate the problem.

Concerns were also expressed over the effects of the noise and smell of the festival and potential issues with parking and access to the area for residents of a nearby retirement complex.

But the planning committee heard there had been no concerns raised by environmental health about the smells and the highways authority had “bottomed out” its concerns over traffic with the organisers.

Organisers had also said they would provide parking at a separate site for up to 200 motorcycles and music would be acoustic rather than amplified.

Although the planning officer had recommended the application be approved the committee unanimously refused it citing concerns over the impact on amenity for local residents the existing offer at the grandstand and traffic in the area.

(KSLA) - Daniel Wimberly said he’s glad he took a chance after noticing social media posts that rapper Torence “Boosie” Hatch had been seen in Shreveport.

Wimberly and his wife Shantina were at a concert in Frisco Texas when they heard that the Louisiana rapper had been spotted. Not knowing whether he would respond Daniel sent Boosie a message inviting him to attend service at Greater Pleasant Grove Baptist Church.

“Daniel my husband always invites everyone to attend church with us. To us it was all about the ministry” Shantina said.

That Sunday Daniel was setting up when he spotted Boosie and his fiancée entering the church.

“While I was playing drums I was shocked because we are a small neighborhood church and here is this national recording artist who doesn’t even know me walking in to visit.”

Wimberly said he revealed at the end of the sermon that he was the one who invited Boosie. Wimberly thanked Boosie for coming and invited him to prayer.

“I told him ‘God bless him.’ Boosie smiled and you can see he was overjoyed. Then our pastor called him up to the front and asked him if he would like to say anything and Mr. Hatch asked for prayer” Wimberly recalled.

He said will never forget the conversation he had with Boosie after church.

“This means a lot to me he is one of my favorite artists and I grew up on his music. You never know what a person is going through so that’s why it’s good to reach out and invite someone to God’s house.”

PITTSBURGH (KDKA) -- From Irwin to North Braddock to Ross Township multiple types of disruptions impacting church services have taken place throughout the Pittsburgh area within the last several weeks.

One of the incidents involved a gun pulled on a pastor during a sermon while another consisted of vandalism impacting an organ and sound equipment.

New federal funding has been approved to help increase security for places of worship and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer says that all types of churches are welcome to apply.

Places of worship can apply for funding through the Nonprofit Security Grant Program and can use the funds for whatever they would like as long as it helps add security. The deadline to apply for funding is May 21.

""I thank God because only God stopped and jammed this gun.""

A man was arrested in North Braddock on Sunday after pulling a gun on a pastor during his sermon at the Jesus' Dwelling Place Church -- and it was all caught on camera.

Bernard Polite is facing attempted homicide and aggravated assault charges and is accused of trying to shoot and kill the pastor.

As the pastor ducked out of the way Polite was tackled by a deacon and held down on the ground until police arrived.

Police are also investigating after a man was found shot to death in Polite's home near the church. It's unclear if he is responsible for that shooting.

""All churches are sacred places which should be treated with respect.""

A church in Westmoreland County fell victim to vandalism late last week and is looking for help identifying the teenagers responsible for the damage.

As a result of the vandalism the church was unable to use the organ for the first two Holy Communion masses the following morning.

The church is now asking for help identifying the two teenagers and say that information will be turned over to Irwin Police.

""It would be nice if people could just practice their religions in peace.""

Last month a man was reported to be walking into nearly a dozen area churches includes St. Sebastian Church in Ross Township and yelling at a priest that he was the devil.

Parishioners said that these type of incidents are especially disturbing because the man's intentions weren't clear.

It was the music that changed first. Or maybe that's just when many people at the pale brick Catholic church in the quiet Wisconsin neighborhood finally began to realize what was happening. The choir director a fixture at St. Maria Goretti for nearly 40 years was suddenly gone. Contemporary hymns were replaced by music rooted in medieval Europe. So much was changing. Sermons were focusing more on sin and confession. Priests were rarely seen without cassocks. Altar girls for a time were banned. At the parish elementary school students began hearing about abortion and hell. ""It was like a step back in time"" said one former parishioner still so dazed by the tumultuous changes that began in 2021 with a new pastor that he only spoke on condition of anonymity. It's not just St. Maria Goretti. Across the U.S. the Catholic Church is undergoing an immense shift. Generations of Catholics who embraced the modernizing tide sparked in the 1960s by Vatican II are increasingly giving way to religious conservatives who believe the church has been twisted by change with the promise of eternal salvation replaced by guitar Masses parish food pantries and casual indifference to church doctrine. The shift molded by plummeting church attendance increasingly traditional priests and growing numbers of young Catholics searching for more orthodoxy has reshaped parishes across the country leaving them sometimes at odds with Pope Francis and much of the Catholic world. The changes are not happening everywhere. There are still plenty of liberal parishes plenty that see themselves as middle-of-the-road. Despite their growing influence conservative Catholics remain a minority. Yet the changes they have brought are impossible to miss.

The progressive priests who dominated the U.S. church in the years after Vatican II are now in their 70s and 80s. Many are retired. Some are dead. Younger priests surveys show are far more conservative. ""They say they're trying to restore what us old guys ruined"" said the Rev. John Forliti 87 a retired Twin Cities priest who fought for civil rights and reforms in Catholic school sex education. Doug Koesel an outspoken 72-year-old priest at Blessed Trinity Parish in Cleveland was blunter: ""They're just waiting for us to die."" At St. Maria Goretti once steeped in the ethos of Vatican II many parishioners saw the changes as a requiem. ""I don't want my daughter to be Catholic"" said Christine Hammond whose family left the parish when the new outlook spilled into the church's school and her daughter's classroom. ""Not if this is the Roman Catholic Church that is coming."" But this is not a simple story. Because there are many who welcome this new old church. They often stand out in the pews with the men in ties and the women sometimes with the lace head coverings that all but disappeared from American churches more than 50 years ago. Often at least a couple families will arrive with four five or even more children signaling their adherence to the church's ban on contraception which most American Catholics have long casually ignored. They attend confession regularly and adhere strictly to church teachings. Many yearn for Masses that echo with medieval traditions — more Latin more incense more Gregorian chants. ""We want this ethereal experience that is different from everything else in our lives"" said Ben Rouleau who until recently led St. Maria Goretti's young adult group which saw membership skyrocket even as the parish shrank amid the turmoil. They are Rouleau said happily out of touch with a liberal city like Madison. ""It's radical in some ways"" Rouleau said. ""We're returning to the roots of the church.""

Three decades of progressive change If this movement emerged from anywhere it might be a now-demolished Denver football stadium and a borrowed military helicopter carrying in Pope John Paul II. Some 500000 people descended on Denver in 1993 for the Catholic festival World Youth Day. When the pope's helicopter landed just outside Mile High Stadium the ground shook from the stomping. The pope whose grandfatherly appearance belied an electric charisma and who was beloved both for his kindness and his sternness confronted an American church shaped by three decades of progressive change. If the church is often best known to non-Catholics for its opposition to abortion it had grown increasingly liberal since Vatican II. Birth control was quietly accepted in many parishes and confession barely mentioned. Catholic social teaching on poverty suffused churches. Most priests traded in their cassocks for plain black shirts with Roman collars. Incense and Latin became increasingly rare. On some issues John Paul II agreed with these liberal-minded Catholics. He spoke against capital punishment and pushed for workers' rights. He preached relentlessly about forgiveness — ""the oxygen that purifies the air of hatred."" He forgave his own would-be assassin. But he was also uncompromising on dogma warning about change and cracking down on liberal theologians. He urged a return to forgotten rituals. Catholics ""are in danger of losing their faith"" he told crowds at the final Denver Mass decrying abortion drug abuse and what he called ""sexual disorders"" a barely veiled reference to growing acceptance of gay rights. Across the nation fervent young Catholics listened. Newman Centers which serve Catholic university students became increasingly popular. So did FOCUS a traditionalist organization working on American college campuses. Conservative Catholic media grew particularly the cable TV network EWTN a prominent voice for increased orthodoxy.

Today conservative Catholic America has its own constellation of online celebrities aimed at young people. There's Sister Miriam James an ever-smiling nun in full habit who talks openly about her hard-partying college days. There's Jackie Francois Angel who speaks in shockingly frank detail about sex marriage and Catholicism. There's Mike Schmitz a movie-star handsome Minnesota priest who exudes kindness while insisting on doctrine. Even today surveys show most American Catholics are far from orthodox. Most support abortion rights. The vast majority use birth control. But increasingly those Catholics are not in church. In 1970 more than half of America's Catholics said they went to Mass at least once a week. By 2022 that had fallen to 17% according to CARA a research center affiliated with Georgetown University. Among millennials the number is just 9%. Even as the U.S. Catholic population has jumped to more than 70 million driven in part by immigration from Latin America ever-fewer Catholics are involved in the church's most important rites. Infant baptisms have fallen from 1.2 million in 1965 to 440000 in 2021 CARA says. Catholic marriages have dropped by well over two-thirds. The shrinking numbers mean that those who remain in the church have outsized influence compared with the overall Catholic population. On the national level conservatives increasingly dominate the U.S. Catholic Bishops Conference and the Catholic intellectual world. They include everyone from the philanthropist founder of Domino's Pizza to six of the nine U.S. Supreme Court justices. Then there's the priesthood. Young priests driven by liberal politics and progressive theology so common in the 1960s and 70s have ""all but vanished"" said a 2023 report from The Catholic Project at Catholic University based on a survey of more than 3500 priests. Today's young priests are far more likely to believe that the church changed too much after Vatican II tangling itself up in America's rapidly shifting views on everything from women's roles to LGBTQ people. ""There really aren't very many liberals in the seminaries anymore"" said a young recently ordained Midwestern priest. He spoke on condition of anonymity because of the turmoil that engulfed his parish after he began pressing for more orthodox services. ""They wouldn't feel comfortable.""

Slow shift toward orthodoxy Sometimes the shift toward orthodoxy happens slowly. Maybe there's a little more Latin sprinkled into Mass or an occasional reminder to go to confession. Maybe guitars are relegated to Saturday evening services or dropped completely. And sometimes the changes come like a whirlwind dividing parishes between those thirsting for a more reverent Catholicism and those who feel their spiritual home has been taken from them. ""You'd leave Mass thinking 'Holy cow! What just happened?'"" said another ex-parishioner at St. Maria Goretti whose family eventually left the church describing the 2021 promotion of a new pastor and a sudden focus on sin and confession. Like many former parishioners he spoke only on condition of anonymity worried about upsetting friends still at the church. Diocesan clergy did not respond to requests for interviews. ""I'm a lifelong Catholic. I grew up going to church every Sunday"" he said. ""But I'd never seen anything like this."" The new outlook has spilled across America. In churches from Minnesota to California parishioners have protested changes introduced by new conservative priests. In Cincinnati it came when the new priest abandoned gospel music and African drumming. In small-town North Carolina it was an intense focus on Latin. In east Texas it was a right-wing bishop forced out by the Vatican after accusing Pope Francis of undermining church teachings. Each can seem like one more skirmish in the cultural and political battles tearing at America. But the movement whether called conservative or orthodox or traditionalist or authentic can be hard to define. It ranges from Catholics who want more incense to Latin Mass adherents who have brought back ancient prayers that mention ""the perfidious Jew."" There are right-wing survivalists celebrity exorcists environmentalists and a handful of quasi-socialists. There's the Catholic news outlet railing against the Vatican's ""wicked entourage"" and the small-town Wisconsin priest who traces COVID-19 to a century-old prophecy and warns of looming dictatorship. There's the recent ""Catholic Prayer for Trump"" a $1000-a-plate dinner at the former president's Mar-a-Lago resort featuring a string of conspiracy theorists.

Yet the orthodox movement can also seem like a tangle of forgiveness and rigidity where insistence on mercy and kindness mingle with warnings of eternity in hell. Looming over the American divide is Pope Francis who has pushed the global church to be more inclusive even as he toes the line on most dogma. The orthodox movement has watched him nervously from the first days of his papacy angered by his more liberal views on issues like gay relationships and divorce. Some reject him entirely. And the pope clearly worries about America. The U.S. church has ""a very strong reactionary attitude"" he told a group of Jesuits last year. ""Being backward-looking is useless."" A new vision of Catholic America You can find this new vision of Catholic America at Latin Masses in Milwaukee the pews crowded with worshippers even at noon on a weekday. It's in conferences held in California wine country at reinvigorated parishes in Tennessee and prayer groups in Washington D.C. And it's at a little Kansas college built high on a bluff above the Missouri River. At first glance nothing seems unusual about Benedictine College. Students worry about unfinished essays and the complexities of dating. They wear cutoff shorts on warm autumn afternoons. Football is huge. The cafeteria food is mediocre. But look deeper. Because at Benedictine Catholic teaching on contraception can slip into lessons on Plato and no one is surprised if you volunteer for 3 a.m. prayers. Pornography premarital sex and sunbathing in swimsuits are forbidden. If these rules seem like precepts of a bygone age that hasn't stopped students from flocking to Benedictine and other conservative Catholic colleges. At a time when U.S. college enrollment is shrinking Benedictine's expansion over the last 15 years has included four new residence halls a new dining hall and an academic center. An immense new library is being built. The roar of construction equipment never seems to stop. Enrollment now about 2200 has doubled in 20 years. Students many of whom grew up in conservative Catholic families jokingly call it ""the Benedictine bubble."" And it might be a window into the future of the Catholic Church in America.

In a deeply secular America where an ever-churning culture provides few absolute answers Benedictine offers the reassurance of clarity. ""We don't all agree on everything obviously"" said John Welte a senior majoring in economics and philosophy. ""But I would say everyone has an understanding of like truth."" ""There are certain things you can just know in your mind: This is right and this is wrong."" Sometimes people here quietly admit it goes too far. Like the students who loudly proclaim how often they go to Mass or the young man who quit his classics course because he refused to read the works of ancient Greek pagans. Very often talk here echoes the 13th-century writings of St. Thomas Aquinas who believed God could be found in truth goodness and beauty. Sometimes they say that means finding God in strict tenets about sexuality. Sometimes in the haunting beauty of Gregorian chants. ""It's a renewal of like some really really good things that we might have lost"" said Madeline Hays a pensive 22-year-old senior biology major. She takes the church's rules seriously from pre-marital sex to confession. She can't stand modern church architecture. She's seriously considering becoming a nun. But she also worries about poverty and America's wastefulness and the way Americans — including herself — can find themselves slotted into the political divide without even knowing it. She wrestles with her belief in an unerring Catholic doctrine that can see good people including some of her own friends as sinners. Yet she doesn't want change. ""The church wouldn't be the church if it changed things it had set down as 'This is infallible doctrine and this will not change through the ages' "" she said. They understand that in Benedictine's small mostly closeted gay community. Like the young man once deeply religious who suffers in silence as people on campus casually throw around anti-gay slurs. He's thought many times of leaving but generous financial aid keeps him here. And after many years he's accepted his sexuality. He's seen the joy that people can get from Benedictine how some will move back to Atchison after graduation just to stay close. But not him. ""I don't think I'll come back to Atchison — not ever.""

Remodeling a spiritual home For decades the pews at St. Maria Goretti were filled with the families of plumbers engineers and professors from the University of Wisconsin just a couple miles up the road. The church is a well-kept island of Catholicism tucked into the leafy residential streets of one of America's most liberal cities. Like so many other parishes it had been shaped by the ideals of the 1960s and 1970s. Poverty and social justice became tightly interwoven with sermons and parish life. Gay people felt welcome. Some of the church's moral absolutes like the contraception ban became forgotten dogma. Change arrived in 2003 with a new bishop Robert C. Morlino an outspoken conservative. Many liberals remember him as the man who lambasted the message of acceptance in the modern hymn ""All Are Welcome."" His successor Bishop Donald J. Hying steers clear of public battles. But in many ways he quietly carries on Morlino's legacy warning about ""the tangled thinking of Modernism."" In 2021 Hying named the Rev. Scott Emerson a one time top Morlino aide as pastor of the Madison church. Parishioners watched — some pleased some uneasily — as their spiritual home was remodeled. There was more incense more Latin more talk of sin and confession. Emerson's sermons are not all fire-and-brimstone. He speaks often about forgiveness and compassion. But his tone shocked many longtime parishioners. Protection is needed he said in a 2023 service from ""the spiritual corruption of worldly vices."" He has warned against critics — ""the atheists journalists politicians the fallen-away Catholics"" — he said were undermining the church. For some Emerson's changes were welcome. ""A lot of us were like 'Hey more confession! Sweet!"" said Rouleau who ran the parish young adult group. ""Better music!""

With payments still coming in and expenses still being settled it will take months into 2021 to know local hospitals’ 2020 margins. It is also not clear if more stimulus money could come to hospitals.

In the spring Ohio hospitals expected to lose an estimated $1.27 billion a month due to the coronavirus with 80% of that due to postponing electives procedures according to the Ohio Hospital Association at the time.

Hospitals furloughed some staff though started bringing workers back in the summer. Then as 2020 progressed people who have met their deductible and people who want procedures previously postponed both wanted to come in.

“We’ve been digging out of that two-month cancellation it really has taken all of the year” Premier Health CEO Mary Boosalis said.

Other expenses remain high for hospitals this year compared to other years. Hospitals all competing for a limited pool of travel agency staff has led to an increase in travel wages. Personal protective equipment is more available than the spring shortage but prices are still up and usage is still high.

“It’s still much more expensive for masks than it was pre-pandemic and we use about four times as many masks on a daily basis. We use about 9000 masks a day across our health system which is about four times more than what we use before the pandemic” said Craig Ganger Premier Health chief finance officer.

Patients with COVID-19 on average stay in the hospital longer than the average patient -- sometimes for over a month -- but depending on the insurance the hospital might get a lump payment for all charges from admission to discharge.

So it’s more expensive to provide the labor-intensive care for a severely ill COVID-19 patient but that doesn’t necessarily mean more money for the hospital.

“I‘ve run into people virtually and publicly and when they see how busy we are with just the volume they assume we’re making money hand over fist” Boosalis said. “But COVID is not a money making deal. We’re going to care for you. That’s our mission. But don’t buy into this idea that we’re going to make a lot of money.”

Leading up to the pandemic local hospitals were coming off a strongly profitable year said Allan Baumgarten an independent analyst who authored the Ohio Health Market Review 2020 who every two years takes a deep dive into hospital financial public records.

Hospitals in the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky/Dayton region had combined net income of $1.309 billion in 2019 (11.4% of net patient revenues) up from $791.6 million in 2018. For the region Premier Health was the most profitable system while Cincinnati Children’s Christ and the Kettering Health Network hospitals reported the strongest net income according to Baumgarten’s calculations.

“Based on 2019 data hospital systems across the state enjoyed stronger profitability and continue to pursue growth through new construction and acquisitions” Baumgarten said.

Baumgarten also noted that the stock market has done well so hospitals’ investments funds have also likely did well in 2020.

Hospitals also received money from the CARES Act. When the Journal-News reviewed the HHS Provider Relief Fund allocation database which were last updated Jan. 21 Miami Valley Hospital is listed having received $64.7 million. Kettering Medical Center is listed receiving $17 million.

Michael Mewhirter CFO at Kettering Health Network said in a written statement to questions about how the health system is financially doing that when elective procedures were suspended in March the network saw a significant decline in patient volume. Those procedures are an essential and important piece of any health care system’s operations and finances.

“At the same time people in the community were concerned about coming to health care facilities putting off appointments and even delaying seeking care in an emergency” Mewhirter said.

In a credit rating issued Jan. 11 Moody’s analysts said Kettering Health “will likely achieve greater than breakeven operating margin budgeted for fiscal 2020 following strong second half performance” though said its operating cash flow margins will likely remain below historically higher levels.

Ohio Medicaid enrollment is up 11% since February 2020 reflecting the struggling economy and job losses. Medicaid pays hospitals less for services than employer-sponsored insurance does. There are also more uninsured people or families financially struggling with the economy.

“It’s anticipated that’s going to be a growing challenge across the industry in this coming year and something that will keep a close eye on. It’s not something that we’ve seen in mass at this point in terms of non-Medicaid patients having a struggle to pay their bills but it’s something that will definitely be keeping a close eye on here” Ganger said.",,,,,,,,,

Bukan karena peluncuran produk baru apalagi ada promo. Tetapi karena 'surat cinta' alias surat keberatan yang dikirim ke YouTuber Dian Widiyanarko karena telah me-review produknya.

Pakar Marketing Yuswohady menilai Eiger telah melakukan kecerobohan (blunder) karena kurang matang merespons konsumen. Di era teknologi seperti ini brand harusnya tidak menentang konsumen karena mereka punya kemampuan besar untuk memberikan pendapat lewat sosial media.

""Enggak (strategi marketing) itu sangat berisiko karena ini di Eiger bikin jelek. Jadi ini blunder kekeliruan dari Eiger. Saya kira kalau dia bereksperimen sebagai strategi untuk meningkatkan awareness itu sangat berisiko sangat berbahaya jadi saya kira Eiger nggak akan berani untuk bereksperimen itu"" kata Yuswohady Jumat (29/1/2021).

Kalaupun keberatan dengan sikap konsumen para brand termasuk Eiger harus membangun pendekatan secara persuasif. Bisa dijelaskan dengan cara diajak bertemu atau melalui sambungan telepon tidak disarankan untuk memberi penjelasan secara tertulis karena berpeluang kasus itu diviralkan.

""Barangkali email itu sudah sopan tapi kan konsumen itu ada yang nakal ada yang bagus macam-macam. Kecenderungannya orang itu kan sekarang cari sensasi si reviewer itu ketika dia dapat email kayak gitu dan berpotensi untuk bisa mempopulerkan dia ya blow up aja dan dia nggak rugi apa-apa karena banyak yang berpihak ke reviewer dengan adanya masalah ini"" tuturnya.

Jika sudah terlanjur blunder seperti Eiger sebuah brand disarankan harus langsung meminta maaf dan tidak menanggapinya dengan meneruskan perselisihan. Hal itu harus dilakukan agar permasalahan tidak berlarut.

""Jangan terus nekat nerusin permusuhan lebih baik minta maaf atau mengklarifikasi. Tapi jangan mengklarifikasinya menentang lebih baik itu minta maaf sambil menjelaskan"" imbuhnya.

Ford announced that Cisco Lamont Neal 37 of Reno was sentenced to up to five years in prison for inducing a minor child to engage in prostitution.

As a result of this sexual exploitation the child endured physical and mental suffering. The crimes were committed between August and September 2019.

Second Judicial District Court Judge Kathleen Drakulich sentenced Neal to 24 to 60 months in the Nevada Department of Corrections for the crime of child abuse neglect or endangerment a category “B” felony and 24-60 months for the crime of Attempt Sex Trafficking a category “C” felony. Both counts will run concurrent to each other. Additionally upon Neal’s release from prison he will have to register as a sex offender.

Do not read on unless you have watched season eight episodes nine and 10.

The laundromat murder

The central conflict is clear early. While CID spend most of their time trying to keep Gilou out of prison he is equally determined to land himself back there. Every crime he commits this week (and it’s an impressive list) he does as a private citizen without official sanction thanks to the squirrelly Judge Vargas. Souleymane’s body showing up raises the stakes for everyone and when the heist is moved forward a week with Gilou promoted from wheelman to gunman a chaotic dash to the hotel ensues. A riotous cops-and-robbers shootout leaves François dead and Titi and Ahmed in custody while Cisco takes Gilou for some unscheduled R&R at Titi’s foster home. He’s had better getaways.

From then on CID really come into their own. Their genius for calling in favours greasing legal gears and witness intimidation – finely honed over 15 years – shines like a bag of conflict diamonds. Ahmed safely in custody is ready to sing like a canary about the crooked cop Escoffier so instrumental to the caper. Laure and Ali have a counter-offer: keep Gilou’s name out of your filthy mouth and we won’t charge you with child murder. Ahmed’s singing career comes to an abrupt halt. There are stunning assists from Edelman and Lucie who run interference on Vargas appealing to his naked careerism. Monsieur le Juge passes the case on to the Cergy prosecutors – et voilà! – Gilou is in the clear. If the system seems bent that’s because it’s so flexible.

From there they just have to find and extract the errant Escoffier. Laure tricks Bilal into giving up Titi and the foster home address then risks everything to go there ahead of the armed strike team to give him the heads-up. Although she is briefly taken hostage by Cisco it winds up with him dead and Gilou free to scarper on foot before some non-corrupt police arrive. Titi is on the hook for the two child murders – Souleymane and Amin. In the end they got their man. They usually do.

Laure

If Laure has to go out – and the way she lives she probably does – then how satisfying that she does so on her own terms. No internal affairs investigation no knife to the guts no epic blunder forces her hand. She calls time after a legendary tour of duty and off the back of one of her greatest triumphs. Her interrogation game is on point her instincts flawless and her scramble to save Gilou as gutsy as it is deranged. She gets the killer and gets her man. No one will ever get Laure like Gilou – no one ever could.

Joséphine

Joséphine’s finale is all about love and death. Her redemption arc hits a bump when her mission to save Souleymane fails. Her charge finally runs out of luck when his benzo withdrawal leaves him a sitting duck for the predatory Titi. His murder leaves Joséphine distraught but she gets it together enough to hit the streets and find the other undocumented minors. They are scared to talk but she persuades them that their murdered friends deserve justice. Issa will testify that Amin planted the tracker at Titi’s behest. It won’t bring them back but it’s something.

Loneliness is a killer too though. With no Lola no Souleymane and even Youssef gone it’s a big apartment for Joséphine to come home to alone. She and Edelman hook up his long game paying off. It has a feel of desperation to it. The French legal system’s answer to Serge Gainsbourg may not be Pierre Clément but he’s alive he’s here and he’s utterly devoted to her. True he’s no Prince Charming – but she’s no Cinderella. Let’s give these two pit bulls a chance.

Gilou

Possession of an illegal weapon theft of class A drugs carjacking impersonating a cleaner – I may have missed a couple but that’s essentially Gilou’s rap sheet for the week. His biggest problem though comes when Judge Vargas hears his voice on the tapes from one of his previous crimes – the domestic gun burglary last week. Once Vargas pulls him off undercover detail it means he either bails on the heist – meaning all his work was for nothing – or goes ahead with the job risking a 20 stretch inside. There’s only one answer and he of course chooses the wrong one. He gets away with it only through a combination of blind luck and the love of a good woman.

Notes and observations",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzAxLzMwL3Rlc2xhcy1wcm9maXRzLWFyZS1ub3QtZnJvbS1zZWxsaW5nLWNhcnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla's Profits Are Not From Selling Cars,"Don't be impressed by Tesla's first annual profit.

Tesla (TSLA -3.76%) is a car company worth over $800 billion that has never turned a profit selling cars. Despite a cult following and intense brand loyalty Tesla has been unable to wring any profits out of the half a million cars it now sells annually.

To be clear Tesla did report a profit for 2020 under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) marking the company's first full year of profitability. But that profit did not come from the core business of manufacturing cars. Tesla booked a whopping $1.58 billion of revenue from selling regulatory credits last year more than the previous three years combined. Tesla's net income of $721 million in 2020 turns into a substantial loss if those regulatory credit sales are backed out.

A regulatory bonanza

Certain U.S. states award regulatory credits to automakers for selling electric vehicles. Automakers must acquire a minimum number of these credits to comply with regulatory requirements. These credits can be bought and sold so an automaker that doesn't sell enough electric vehicles can buy credits from other automakers that do.

This regulatory credit system is an attempt by governments to encourage electric vehicle production and reduce emissions. It's ended up essentially subsidizing Tesla's money-losing car operation. Since Tesla only produces electric cars it's able to sell reams of credits to other automakers that are unwilling or unable to produce enough electric cars.

It should be obvious that this situation is not going to last forever. Automakers are aggressively ramping up their electric vehicle efforts and there's little reason to believe that Tesla has any real advantage beyond its brand. One example: General Motors is pouring billions into its electric vehicle efforts with plans for dozens of models over the next few years. GM also recently unveiled a new commercial electric vehicle brand and it already has delivery giant FedEx as a customer.

This regulatory credit windfall for Tesla will start to vanish as other automakers ramp up their electric vehicle sales. Tesla will then need to figure out how to profitably manufacture cars.

An extreme valuation

Tesla's valuation of more than $800 billion is quadruple that of Toyota. Toyota sold nearly 10 million cars in 2020 compared to half a million for Tesla.

I would argue that it probably won't matter how well Tesla does over the coming years because the valuation is so extreme that a positive result for investors would require absolutely everything to go right. The company can do well even very well and the stock could still fall apart.

Here's an example from the dot-com bubble. Cisco Systems stock hit an all-time high around $80 in early 2000. The networking hardware company was valued at nearly $550 billion at its peak.

Today Cisco is the dominant provider of enterprise networking hardware. The company's share of the enterprise switch market hovers around 50% despite no shortage of low-cost competition. Cisco's revenue has soared from about $19 billion in 2000 to nearly $50 billion today. Net income has shot up from $2.7 billion to over $11 billion. Cisco the company has been an unquestionable success story.

Cisco the stock on the other hand has been an unmitigated disaster. If you bought Cisco stock at its peak you're down over 40% more than 20 years later. The company is worth around $200 billion today. You were right about the company but very wrong about the stock.

Tesla the company doing well in the long run does not in any way guarantee that Tesla the stock does well. You can be right about Tesla becoming a top automaker and still lose your shirt investing in the stock. Even if Tesla does wean itself off regulatory credits and starts manufacturing millions of cars annually at a profit the valuation is so deep into the stratosphere that it may not even matter.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vYnJpZ2h0c2lkZW9mbmV3cy5jb20vdnBuL2hvdy10by1zZXQtdXAtYXNhLTU1MTYtYXMtdnBuLWRtei_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to set up Cisco ASA NAT 5516-X as DMZ VPN,"Setting up a Cisco ASA NAT 5516-X as a virtual private network in a demilitarized zone shouldn’t be much more difficult than configuring any other provisionally allowed connection in a similar environment. So long as your firmware is any newer than ancient you should be able set up this behavior irrespective of network complexity (i.e. whether your target hosts are even inside a DMZ).

Why allow a VPN in a DMZ at all?

Short for Adaptive Security Appliance the Cisco ASA series consists of hardware meant to separate a private network from the Internet. Meaning it delivers a firewall first and foremost. Don’t let this part confuse you; while a product like the Cisco ASA NAT 5516-X isn’t exactly advertised as a solution for private network virtualization it’s fully compatible with VPN use cases.

That’s especially true with a DMZ in the mix though you might simply want the extra security benefits of a VPN. Either way there are things that need to happen before you can start thinking about rerouted connections.

Hold your VPNs: updating the ASA NAT 5516-X

As with most network buildouts there are many ways to accomplish basic VPN functionality while working with physical firewalls. Note that these instructions should apply to all products from the ASA 5500-X series. With that said the example configuration will use the ASA NAT 5516-X because it’s a popular choice among VPN power users who also happen to be Cisco customers.

Keep in mind that this is not a comprehensive tutorial on how to get started with advanced network system administration. We’ll revise the basics just in case it’s highly recommended have them figured out beforehand. Not least because ensuring that your ASA NAT 5516-X unit is running the latest firmware is part of that challenge – you’re risking major connectivity issues otherwise.

And if for any bizarre reason your system happens to be using a truly ancient OS DMZ VPN features won’t work at all. Though that hopefully won’t be an issue as we’re talking about pre-8.3 ASA firmware which is nearly half a decade old at this point.

Either way proceed by confirming the basic firewall functionality of your ASA NAT 5516-X is working as intended. Meaning that your DMZ has Internet connectivity and your private network is actually private. If you were already running a robust live network go over the infrastructure and make a note of any atypical device configurations. Primarily because if your system is already barely held together by unidentified cables duct tape and prayers adding VPN-related instructions might just be what pushes it over the edge. Also accounting for every use case is impossible so our example scenario will include a pretty vanilla setup with near-factory settings.

RA VPN licensing requirements

You don’t have to authorize the necessary license purchases before moving on to the technical stuff. If you have a registered Cisco Smart Software Manager account licensing red tape should hence not cause any DMZ VPN deployment delays.

As of this writing Cisco’s Remote Access (RA) VPN service is bundled with AnyConnect Apex AnyConnect Plus and AnyConnect VPN Only licenses. In order to maximize the interoperability potential between the ASA NAT 5516-X and a DMZ VPN you’ll also need to be eligible for the Strong Encryption (3DES/AES) license. Due to the way virtual private networks work a bulletproof encryption standard is of paramount importance in any scenario.

If you’re eligible the Strong Encryption (3DES/AES) license should be activated automatically on the ASA NAT 5516-X. Eligibility pretty much solely depends on whether the U.S. government allows Cisco to sell military-grade tech to (companies headquartered in) your country. And yes very large numbers qualify as both “military-grade tech” and “fitting ways to describe what AES is”.

How to set up the ASA NAT 5516-X as a VPN in a DMZ

The kind of VPN functionality we’re working to achieve here is twofold. It consists of allowing rerouted inbound connections to a specific DMZ server and greenlighting outbound connections to the World Wide Web from rerouted DMZ hosts.

Best practices say to start with the letter. After all your DMZ users will need to have their private IP addresses translated into something discernible by the wider TCP/IP net since even fully functional inbound connections would be one-way otherwise. This would be the external IP address associated with your ASA NAT 5516-X system in case you want to do things manually. But if your setup includes a DHCP or your public IP is dynamic for any other reason the easiest course of action is calling upon AutoNAT aka Object NAT.

In any case the Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM) app should do the trick. In an elementary ASA NAT setup consisting of three interfaces interlinked with three network segments the first part of your configuration should resemble the following:

object network inside-subnet subnet 192.168.0.0 XXX.XXX.XXX.X nat (insideoutside) dynamic interface ! object network dmz-subnet subnet 192.168.1.0 XXX.XXX.XXX.X nat (dmzoutside) dynamic interface

This NAT rule will automatically translate local IP addresses to your system-wide public identifier. If you take a closer look at the parameters you’ll see that we have greenlit outgoing requests from both DMZ and internal hosts.

Now repeat that procedure to allow Internet hosts to access one or more of your internal servers. Keep in mind that there’s a difference between allowing two-way communications and accepting two-way communications requests. The latter will only be possible if your DMZ is unrestricted. Otherwise the ASA NAT 5516-X can only support truly bi-directional communications for one object (either inside-dmz or outside-dmz).

Ultimately you’ll always have to manually exempt DMZ-to-VPN traffic or all of your work up to this point will have been for nothing. Without explicitly allowing such connections in a compatible setup the ASA NAT 5516-X will always default to a PAT override based on a superseding identity ruleset that’s guaranteed to exist if your pre-VPN network was ever operational."

In the same period the Citigroup stock has declined slightly by 0.63% from $58.36 to $57.99.

Why has MicroStrategy stock performed so strongly despite the downgrade?

MicroStrategy has been investing its treasury holdings in Bitcoin making BTC is treasury reserve asset. Currently it is the biggest public company holder with over 70K BTC worth roughly $2.4 billion at today's prices.

Moreover on Dec. 9 2020 MicroStrategy announced raising $550 million in capital from convertible bonds.

In an official statement MicroStrategy explicitly said that it intends to invest in Bitcoin with the proceeds of the bond. This is also the statement that is said to have triggered Citi to downgrade MicroStrategy. The statement read:

“MicroStrategy intends to invest the net proceeds from the sale of the notes in bitcoin in accordance with its Treasury Reserve Policy pending the identification of working capital needs and other general corporate purposes.”

At the time Citigroup analyst Tyler Radke issued a sell rating. He acknowledged that the return on MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin investment has been “impressive” but said the market is overpricing the core business of the firm. He wrote:

“MSTR's bitcoin investment has returned $250M (or worth $26/share or +20% towards stock) since August '20. While impressive it pales in comparison to the 172% return in the stock. At the current stock price our analysis suggests that the market is pricing in much more optimistic valuation scenarios for the core business and Bitcoin.”

Since December 2020 however the price of Bitcoin saw an explosive rally. While the skepticism toward the core business of MicroStrategy could have some merit BTC saw a rally of over 100% in the last month of the year.

In just December Bitcoin rallied from $18319 to over $42000 on Binance outperforming most assets in both the stock market and the crypto market.

What’s next?

MicroStrategy remains an important multi-billion dollar business intelligence firm with strong core business.

But as long as the price of Bitcoin continues to increase in the near term it will likely have a positive impact on the stock price of MSTR.

Michael Saylor the CEO of MicroStrategy remains fully confident in the company’s position on Bitcoin and often buying the price dips. In the fourth quarter financial results for 2020 Saylor wrote:

“Going forward we continue to plan to hold our bitcoin and invest additional excess cash flows in bitcoin. Additionally we will explore various approaches to acquire additional bitcoin as part of our overall corporate strategy.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Instead the shortstop’s free-agency seemed to take a backseat to the attention focused on J.T. Realmuto.

So perhaps it was fitting that a day after the Phillies officially squared away Realmuto they signed Gregorius to a two-year contract worth $28 million. Gregorius scored the contract he wanted — a multi-year deal after playing last season on a one-year pact — and did it without much of a campaign behind him. A source said the deal is pending a physical.

Gregorius played all 60 games last season hitting .284 with a .827 OPS. He turns 31 on Feb. 18 a day after the team’s first scheduled spring workout for pitchers and catchers.

“I loved playing with these guys” Gregorius said after last season. “They were a great group of guys. I had fun playing the game the right way with these guys.”

The Phillies have committed $152.5 million this winter to free agents more than all but one other team. They signed Realmuto Friday to a five-year contract worth $115.5 million as they retained both of their top free agents a scenario that seemed unlikely when the season ended.

The team’s tone at the start of the offseason was quite pessimistic seeming to set the stage for a winter of restricted spending. But that changed in December when Dave Dombrowski was hired as president of baseball operations.

The new leader of the team’s baseball operations said earlier this month that the Phillies are thinking about winning in 2021. And they’ll try to do that with virtually the same lineup they had last season which they finished four-games below .500 and in third place.

But the bullpen — which finished last season as baseball’s worst in 90 years — has seen the addition of Archie Bradley and a group of low-risk arms. They added depth to their rotation on Friday by signing veteran Matt Moore a move that required trading Cole Irvin on Saturday to Oakland to create room on the 40-man roster. Kyle Holder an infielder selected in December’s Rule 5 draft who has yet to play above double A was traded to Cincinnati to make room on the roster for Gregorius.

The offense might look the same as last year’s lineup but it was hardly the reason the Phillies missed the postseason for a ninth-straight year. They scored the sixth-most runs in baseball had the seventh-best OPS and the ninth-best batting average. They had seven hitters — including Gregorius — post an OPS better than league average.

Since 2017 Gregorius has the 10th-best WAR among all shortstops fourth-best fielding percentage fifth-most home runs sixth-most RBIs and 11th-highest OPS.

He was a sound defender last season and strong clubhouse presence which was one of the reasons the Phillies were attracted to him before last season. Joe Girardi who managed Gregorius with the Yankees urged the front office to bring him to Philadelphia.

The Phillies engaged this winter with other free-agent shortstops but the market dried quickly this week. Freddy Galvis Andrelton Simmons and Marcus Semien all agreed to one-year deals on Tuesday within a matter of hours. Only Semien who had a .840 OPS over the last two seasons in Oakland was graded higher than Gregorius in ESPN’s free-agent rankings. The Phillies watched the market move without them yet still came away with a prize.

With Gregorius at shortstop the Phillies will have to find a place for Scott Kingery. It’s unlikely Kingery will start at second base over Jean Segura but instead compete with Adam Haseley and Roman Quinn for the centerfield job. But that could all be moot if the National League again uses a designated hitter or if Dombrowski has more moves lined up before camp begins.

For now the Phillies have their shortstop. It was an offseason quest to solidify the position and it led them Saturday to bringing back their own player. Gregorius scored the contract he wanted and the Phillies landed their shortstop. The only thing missing was a hashtag.

In the long term oil and gas reserves will eventually run out. Bahrain and Oman are in the most precarious position with reserves expected to run out within the next decade for Bahrain and within 25 years for Oman. 5 In the medium term revenues from oil are expected to decline in the face of reductions in global demand starting around 2040 if not sooner. 6 This will be driven by higher demand for renewable energy and improvements in energy efficiency and storage. In the short term GCC countries are already tapping into $2 trillion in financial assets accumulated over decades and invested in sovereign wealth funds (SWF) for future generations (see Figure 2). 7 Before the pandemic the International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimated that unless GCC countries undertake substantial fiscal and economic reforms they will deplete their conserved wealth by 2034. 8 The pandemic has likely shortened this timeline.

The issue of economic diversification has gained a renewed sense of urgency in Gulf Arab countries. A global economic slowdown induced by the coronavirus pandemic pushed Brent crude prices down from $64 per barrel at the start of 2020 to a low of $23 in April 2020 (see Figure 1). 1 Oil prices are expected to remain below $50 per barrel through 2022. 2 This has placed substantial pressure on the fiscal positions of Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries 3 which are expected to run budget deficits averaging 9.2 percent in 2020 and 5.7 percent 2021. 4

Unfortunately private sector activity in the GCC continues to rely heavily on government-funded projects and consumption that are ultimately supported by oil and gas revenues. GCC policymakers must overcome the shortcomings of previous diversification efforts and create incentives for real economic development that is not reliant directly or indirectly on the oil and gas sector. GCC countries must also diversify their revenue streams by building up sovereign wealth funds and avoiding projects that require ongoing government support or subsidies. Many government-funded mega projects are white elephants that fall into this category. Finally GCC countries must involve their citizens more closely in wealth and economic diversification efforts. This should include encouraging savings and investment at an individual level.

There has been no shortage of policy advice from think tanks international organizations and consultants on what GCC governments can do to diversify their economies and prepare for a post-hydrocarbon future. However this policy advice has often failed to address the political-economic realities of the governing social contract in which GCC governments rely on specific economic channels to transfer hydrocarbon wealth to their citizens. These channels often stand in the way of necessary reforms. This policy brief aims to outline the economic reforms that GCC countries must take in order to diversify their economies and promote sustainable growth taking into consideration the constraints imposed by the governing social contract.

Resource Rents: A Blessing and a Challenge

GCC countries have been blessed with an abundance of natural resources. They have invested this wealth in improving the lives of their citizens developing their infrastructure and preparing for a future without oil. GCC countries have made substantial progress toward the first two goals.9 They have built modern cities and the infrastructure to service them providing a solid foundation for future economic development. All have Human Development Index scores above 0.8 placing them collectively ahead of all other Middle East and North African (MENA) countries and on par with some countries of the European Union (EU).10

However GCC countries have struggled to achieve progress on the third goal: diversifying their economies. Despite good intentions reflected in their national visions and economic development plans11 GCC economies remain stubbornly dependent on hydrocarbons.12 Reducing this dependence has several dimensions. First and foremost it involves replacing oil and gas production with the production of goods and services that are not dependent directly or indirectly on the oil and gas sector. It also involves replacing government revenues derived from oil and gas with revenues from other sources such as taxes on consumption and non-oil sectors but not to the extent that these emerging sectors become hampered and uncompetitive. Thus to succeed economic diversification requires other key ingredients including moderating government spending increasing non-oil exports and increasing foreign direct investment (FDI).

While GCC states have made some progress over the past decade (see Figure 3) oil and gas production continues to represent over 40 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in most countries except for the United Arab Emirates (UAE) (30 percent) and Bahrain (18 percent).13 Even so much of the region’s other economic activities such as construction and infrastructure development are directly supported by revenues from oil and gas. In Bahrain’s case oil accounts for a small share of GDP because it has largely depleted its oil reserves;14 however oil continues to support economic activity indirectly through transfers and spending from neighboring countries. Similarly while improvements have been made in diversifying government revenues hydrocarbons account for 70 percent or more of total revenue (see Figure 4) except for Saudi Arabia (68 percent) and the UAE (36 percent). Even so again many of the diverse revenue streams in those two countries derive from economic activities supported by oil and gas.15

Gulf countries do produce goods and services within their borders mainly for domestic consumption. These include agricultural products manufactured goods and business services. However domestically produced goods and services will not soon replace the vast quantities of imported goods and services that are needed to support the 27 million citizens and 29 million expatriates living in the region.16 Furthermore real economic diversification requires producing goods and services other than hydrocarbons and their derivatives that can be traded with the rest of the world. Here Gulf countries still have a long way to go. In 2018 hydrocarbons and related products represented over 90 percent of total exports in Kuwait and Qatar over 80 percent of total exports in Saudi Arabia and Oman and over 50 percent of total exports in the UAE and Bahrain (see Figure 5).17

Another indicator of an economy’s potential competitiveness is FDI which reflects the willingness of foreign entities to invest in a country. FDI too is lagging in the GCC. Between 2015 and 2019 only Oman and the UAE had FDI inflows (as a share of GDP) that were higher than the world average of 2.5 percent.18 Net inflows of FDI into the GCC as a whole were only 1.1 percent of GDP; this represents less than half the global average and almost three times less than FDI inflows into high-income economies (see Figure 6).19 The weak business environment in most GCC states is part of the reason behind such low FDI inflows. It is difficult for firms that are not connected to insiders to enter and compete in the market.20 Furthermore policy changes often occur on an ad hoc basis with little warning or recourse. These might include limiting work permits from specific countries limiting the transfer of funds overseas and cutting off economic ties with neighbors. Such policy uncertainties increase the risk to international and even local businesses wishing to invest in the region. When they were flush with revenue from oil and gas GCC states had the luxury of making arbitrary policy decisions and even costly policy mistakes. However the tighter fiscal realities of today require them to be more responsive to the needs and concerns of investors.



The key to economic diversification remains developing non-hydrocarbon sectors in which GCC economies can compete. While it is not clear what these sectors might be this is a difficult question to answer without trial and error. While the GCC is unlikely to become competitive in agriculture this can be a source of import substitution. Manufacturing has promise but GCC economies must build infrastructure and create free zones to compete against low-cost manufacturers in Asia. Dubai has positioned itself as a financial business and logistics hub for the region something that might have been difficult to imagine fifty years ago. Can the region accommodate other such hubs? Most GCC countries want to create high-tech knowledge economies but this requires a level of skills and research facilities that remain in short supply. The GCC might be able to build a competitive technology ecosystem by importing talent from other Arab and Asian countries. Tourism has shown promise in Oman Saudi Arabia and the UAE while Qatar is trying to position itself as a hub for cultural and sports tourism. Islamic banking could be an area where the GCC might develop a competitive advantage.21

Successful economic diversification and sustainable economic growth require building sectors that are truly independent of oil and gas. Over time as oil and gas revenues fall these independent sectors can expand as economic activity shifts away from hydrocarbon-supported sectors. The ability to create independent sectors rests on three pillars: (1) introducing a fiscal framework that allocates oil and gas revenues into either short-term rents or long-term investments with minimum economic distortions; (2) enabling an export-oriented private sector that is not dependent on oil and gas to grow and thrive; and (3) building a capable and motivated workforce outside the public sector including entrepreneurs.22 Gulf countries have made some progress on all three fronts. However they have been more apt to pursue partial reforms that provide the illusion of economic diversification but in reality continue to rely to a large extent on revenues from oil and gas.

Diversification Efforts Gain Traction

GCC governments have sought to diversify their economies by supporting sectors that often reflect the preferences of policymakers more than the competitive strengths of their economies. However most GCC states have come to realize that these diversification models are themselves unsustainable and have begun creating space for real private sector development. These efforts were initially led by Bahrain which had the most limited oil reserves in the GCC. However Bahrain has since been eclipsed by the emirate of Dubai which also has limited oil reserves and which has set the pace for the rest of the UAE.23 The UAE has been leading the other GCC countries in terms of providing an enabling environment for business and entrepreneurship. For example over the past decade all GCC countries have made significant progress in terms of ease of starting a business based on the World Bank Ease of Doing Business Index (see Figure 7).24

Gulf countries have also developed more holistic approaches to their diversification efforts in recent years. They have embedded economic diversification into their national visions and established commissions to better integrate the private sector into ongoing economic activities.25 They have also established agencies to support small and medium enterprise (SME) development and financing such as Saudi Arabia’s Small and Medium Enterprise Authority26 Qatar Development Bank27 and Oman’s Riyada.28 SMEs are the cornerstone of diversification efforts as their growth creates real economic value and jobs.

These policy actions have been supplemented by free trade zones and special economic zones that operate to various degrees outside the regulatory distortions of the private sector. These zones help attract FDI and serve as hubs for innovation that could be absorbed over time into the national economy. The UAE has 45 free zones that allow 100 percent foreign ownership.29 Bahrain has gone a step further and allows 100 percent foreign ownership in several sectors including real estate communication and administrative services.30 Gulf states also introduced hubs for innovation within their ecosystems such as Bahrain’s International Investment Park31 Qatar’s Science and Technology Park32 and Saudi Arabia’s Prince Abdullah Science Park.33

Gulf states have also introduced educational reforms aimed at better aligning graduates’ skills with market needs.34 In countries where a vast majority of young people typically indicate a preference for public sector jobs interest in entrepreneurship and private sector employment has risen. Initiatives supporting young entrepreneurs and providing them with training and counseling have spread across the Gulf. In Oman vocational training centers and technical colleges have introduced the Know About Business (KAB) program developed by the International Labour Organization (ILO) to support knowledge on the private sector.35 INJAZ Al-Arab a regional non-governmental organization (NGO) targets aspiring young entrepreneurs in all six GCC countries and provides them with needed support and training.36

Yet even though business regulations have improved and the startup ecosystem has developed significantly over the past two decades GCC countries continue to lag in providing an enabling business environment and continue to suffer from weak capacity among their nationals.37 The private sector in the GCC as in much of the MENA region is overregulated and governed by an entrenched system of clientelism and connections. This is further exacerbated by the fact that much private sector activity is run through public or quasi-public enterprises relies on government contracts is financed through public financial institutions and is supported through government subsidies or handouts. In such an environment it is difficult for the private sector to grow organically or for someone who is not politically connected to establish and grow a successful business. These factors have their origins in the political economy and the governing social contract of the GCC states.

The Political Economy of Gulf Rentier States

Gulf states began exporting oil in the 1940s and 1950s leading to substantial increases in their incomes and wealth. GCC governments have been passing on this wealth to their citizens through three main channels. First they have expanded and improved public benefits and services including education health care and access to finance. Second they have provided their citizens with access to public sector employment opportunities at substantially higher wages and benefits than those offered by the private sector.38 Citizens flocked into government jobs and public sector employment rates among citizens reached 90 percent in some states.39 Third Gulf states have provided business owners with access to economic rents through government contracts and exclusive licenses allowing them to generate excess income and profits from their businesses.

Understanding the nature of this social contract is important and has implications for the kinds of policy reforms that are both needed and might succeed. The key point is that these channels exist for a reason: they allow citizens to access their legitimate share of their country’s hydrocarbon wealth. The channels operationalize the social contract and will not be easy to renegotiate even as oil revenues decline. Aligning public sector salaries with those in the private sector means that citizens will receive fair compensation for their efforts but citizens will cease to access their share of the wealth through public sector wage premiums. Limiting the access of citizen-owned businesses to exclusive contracts means that they will earn profits dictated by the market but again citizens will cease to access their share of the wealth through exclusive business contracts. Instituting such reforms without first identifying and putting in place alternative channels for sharing natural resource rents is both unfair and doomed to failure.

That said reforms are needed. Channeling economic rents through expanded public services government employment and exclusive business contracts has weakened efforts to develop a competitive dynamic private sector that is capable of generating sustainable economic growth in a post-hydrocarbon future. Yet any policy effort to reduce rent-seeking behavior requires addressing the constraints of the governing social contract or introducing new channels. Once natural resource rents run out Gulf countries will be in a precarious position of having to maintain the deadweight of channels that no longer serve a purpose. What can a country do when it can no longer afford to cover the costs of a large public sector workforce that has long-term contracts and does not have the skills to transition to jobs in the private sector?

Reexamining policy reforms through the lens of the social contract can present novel policy insights. Each of these requires policy changes that increase private sector and private citizen activity. This will not be easy in countries that subscribe to a state-led development paradigm.

Addressing the Sustainability of Public Services and Encouraging Citizen Participation

As GCC countries began accumulating wealth they initially focused on improving public goods and services. This started with education health and utilities but quickly expanded to other sectors including banking finance telecommunications and transportation. In terms of basic public services GCC governments have done a remarkable job of improving access for all their citizens. For example educational attainment has improved considerably in the region. However quality remains a concern. GCC students are among the lowest-scoring students on standardized international tests. While reform efforts have improved outcomes they have not resulted in major shifts.40 In the long run GCC governments should consider granting hospitals schools universities and other purveyors of public services greater financial autonomy and establishing endowments to ensure their long-term sustainability. States can also encourage wealthy citizens to fund social services through private non-profit initiatives. Privately established endowments (known as “awkaf”) have a long and rich history in the Gulf region but were largely displaced by government initiatives after the discovery of oil. Bringing them back would allow private citizens to contribute to their country’s future and support a deeper change in the social contract.

Improving the Regulation of Public Sector Enterprises

Many industries across the Gulf have come to be dominated by large state-owned or state-run enterprises even in industries that are normally the purview of the private sector such as banking construction fuel distribution and insurance. These state-owned enterprises played an important role in stimulating modernization innovation and economic growth. However over time they came to dominate their respective sectors. They erected bureaucratic barriers to entry preventing smaller enterprises from growing and competing in their space.41 Indeed many public enterprises effectively serve as the main regulators of their industries. Furthermore while some state-owned enterprises have extended their operations internationally a closer examination suggests that they were able to do so because of public subsidies and support such as paying no taxes or paying below market price for inputs such as energy land and capital. There is little evidence to suggest that these state-owned enterprises can compete in a global economy without continued support. Rather than serving as a source of new revenue they draw resources away from more promising economic sectors.

Still state-owned enterprises remain a valuable source of public services innovation and employment. GCC governments are not likely to consider privatization unless they have to. However reforms can be introduced to create a more competitive environment around them. GCC states need to develop a clear strategy for delineating the sectors and industries where public enterprises will operate and leave other sectors free from their interference. They also need to be transparent about record-keeping and ensure that all subsidies and support are clear and limited. Finally GCC governments must build a firewall between public enterprises and their regulatory agencies. This would not only be a form of good governance but would also improve competition and help to spur innovation and economic growth in the long run.

Encouraging Real Private Sector Development

Much private sector activity in GCC countries continues to be linked directly or indirectly to government contracts and spending that in turn are funded through revenues from oil and gas. This tends to benefit public enterprises and private companies that are connected to ruling elites at the expense of more competitive SMEs and startups which should form the foundation upon which future growth and prosperity are built. In addition members of the ruling elite may simultaneously hold government positions and head their own companies gaining an ability to tilt the playing field to their advantage.42 Such constraints to private sector activity and competition reduce the incentive for entrepreneurs to introduce the kind of disruptive innovation that can create globally competitive industries that drive true economic diversification. Consequently the private sector’s contribution to GDP remains low. While official estimates are difficult to come by in Saudi Arabia for example it was below 40 percent in 2018.43

This kind of rent-seeking is part of the governing social contract and will likely continue but it can be moderated and limited to specific economic sectors and activities. For example holding a government job while owning a business that benefits from government contracts represents double-dipping and has the potential to be mitigated. GCC states should also keep growth-oriented export-driven sectors that are not dependent on revenues from oil and gas free from insider meddling. Also they should continue to expand their free zones and economic zones especially those that are developed around influence-free sectors. GCC states must also continue their efforts to reduce burdensome laws and regulations. These include introducing bankruptcy laws removing the need for virtual companies to have a physical address reducing the time and number of steps it takes to register a business allocating a minimum share of government contracts to SMEs ensuring that government payments are made on time and improving access to finance for SMEs.

Finally GCC governments should strive to disentangle politics and business. Too often private economic activity is subordinated to impulsive political considerations. This increases risk and uncertainty and dampens international interest in investing in the region. The blockade of the UAE Saudi Arabia and Bahrain against Qatar is a case in point. The blockade disrupted supply chains investment flows business contracts and even employee living arrangements.44 It came at a high cost to all countries involved with little political gain to show for it. GCC countries should remain mindful of the benefits of maintaining a stable and predictable investment climate and aim to keep politics away from the more crucial long-term objective of achieving sustainable economic growth and ensuring the prosperity of future generations. Equally important GCC governments should establish formal mechanisms for regulatory notification and public comment. This would improve the quality and effectiveness of regulations as well as increase the transparency of the regulatory process which would go a long way toward assuaging the concerns of potential investors.

Addressing Employment Challenges

GCC governments provide their nationals with access to public sector jobs at high wages and benefits as a means of accessing their share of the economic rents.45 The system affects the education and career choices of nationals who typically seek the minimum credentials needed to access public sector jobs with less concern for developing the skills needed to contribute to productive jobs in the private sector.46 The result is a segmented labor market with citizens dominating the public sector and expatriates prevailing in the private sector.47 Furthermore because public salaries include a share of economic rents the civil service salary structure for nationals is both augmented and compressed. Those at the lower end of the salary scale with the least marketable skills are paid higher premiums over private sector alternatives compared to those with higher skills. This creates perverse incentives in terms of sector preference with lower-skilled workers more resistant to accepting private sector work. Also whenever GCC states wish to increase the share of oil rents distributed through the wage structure in response to political conditions or increases in the price of oil it results in an appreciation of the wage bill that is not easily reversed when circumstances change.

With the decline in oil revenues public sector jobs have become scarce and GCC governments have transferred the responsibility for employing nationals to the private sector. However people’s sense of entitlement has transferred with them.48 This is manifested in expectations of higher wages and benefits and weak motivation to work.49 In return private sector employers typically avoid hiring citizens unless obliged to do so by the state. In such cases they often treat this as a cost of doing business and do not develop the hired citizens’ productive capacities.50 This breaks the link between performance and reward and creates an entitlement mentality51 which may persist after oil rents have been depleted. It has also resulted in high unemployment rates among young nationals who queue for scarce public sector jobs despite the large supply of jobs in the private sector that are filled by expatriate workers. Youth unemployment rates among young nationals in most GCC countries with available data are high reaching for example 40 percent in Saudi Arabia.52

GCC states have been reluctant to tackle this system of entrenched interests in employment. Attempts to bring public sector wages and benefits into alignment with those in the private sector have not been successful.53 For instance Saudi Arabia was forced to reverse a decision to cut public sector benefits in 2017 after “widespread grumbling.”54 Some GCC governments have sought to maintain the wage gap between citizens and expatriates by increasing the latter’s work permit fees. However this increases business costs and reduces their ability to compete globally hampering long-run diversification efforts. A more effective strategy would be to make this channel for accessing economic rents more explicit. This could be done by introducing a scheme similar to an income tax credit. Employers would pay citizens a fair market wage while the state would supplement this with a basic social wage or bonus that reflects their share of economic rents. This kind of transparency would better link wages for nationals to productivity and performance. It would also make it easier for GCC states to adjust the social element of the wages in response to changing economic circumstances and can more easily be communicated to their citizens.

The Road Ahead

Policy efforts aimed at economic diversification must take legitimate rent-seeking behavior into account. GCC governments will have to engage in an honest conversation with their citizens regarding the financial constraints they face and the options going forward and then redraw the parameters of the governing social contract in a way that is perceived as equitable and fair. This renegotiation must involve both political elites and ordinary citizens giving up some of their benefits and privileges in light of reduced hydrocarbon reserves and lower prices that are expected to persist and decline further in the long run. Asking ordinary citizens to give up access to government jobs or reduce their salaries and benefits without business owners giving up excess profits from exclusive contracts will sow public resentment and social unrest. Over the past two decades GCC countries have created free zones innovation parks and entrepreneurship hubs outside the frameworks of their rentier-based private sectors. Yet these policies remain rudimentary. In preparing for a post-oil future GCC states will have to further reduce public services benefits and jobs and limit opportunities for rent-seeking in the private sector.

The coronavirus pandemic and lower global oil prices have increased the pressure on Gulf states to push ahead with economic diversification efforts. GCC policymakers must look beyond the immediate impetus to cut budgets and focus instead on developing the necessary building blocks for a dynamic and sustainable post-hydrocarbon economy. The economic and political pressures facing Gulf states have already induced Saudi Arabia the UAE and Bahrain to end their three-and-a-half-year blockade of Qatar opening the door to greater regional economic integration. Likewise economic pressures have created space for a more open and honest dialogue between citizens and their states regarding financial constraints economic rents and channels for their distribution. Providing clarity on which parts of the economy will be allowed to grow unimpeded is central to creating incentives for young nationals to engage in these sectors. Market-based mechanisms can then be allowed to function in these sectors disentangled from rent-seeking behavior. Together more competitive economic sectors and greater regional integration can increase the global competitiveness of GCC economies and support their economic diversification efforts.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVsZWRnZXIuY29tL3N0b3J5L2J1c2luZXNzL2JyaWVmcy8yMDIxLzAxLzMwL3Blb3BsZS1jaGFuZ2VzLXJlbmVlLWJ1dGxlci1uYW1lZC1mbG9yaWRhLXJlYWwtZXN0YXRlLWNvbW1pc3Npb24vNDI5MzkyMzAwMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,People & changes: Butler joins Real Estate Commission; Ammons named Southern U. chancellor,"The Ledger

JHVEPhoto | iStock Editorial | Getty Images

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is expected to become a more aggressive consumer watchdog under the Biden administration and while the coronavirus pandemic hurls financial challenges at millions of Americans. Consumer advocates say the bureau was almost entirely declawed under former president Donald Trump and during his tenure enforcement action steeply declined. The agency was created in 2010 after the previous economic downturn to protect people from predatory lenders. Now it's anticipated that the CFPB will more aggressively investigate consumer complaints and take action against companies that violate the law. To lead it President Biden has nominated 38-year-old Rohit Chopra a longtime consumer advocate and a former student loan ombudsman at the CFPB.

Of course some were skeptical of the agency's work during the Obama administration when Biden served as vice president. Mick Mulvaney who served as Trump's acting CFPB director at one time called the agency a ""joke"" in ""a sick sad kind of way."" But its work has never been more important advocates say as so many Americans try to rebuild their finances after almost a year of record job losses evictions and increased debt. As people's money woes have increased so have their issues with financial companies: Complaints to the CFPB were up 60% in 2020 from 2019. ""There are potentially a dozen two dozen priorities"" said Richard Cordray who served as CFPB director from 2012 to 2017. ""There's a lot that needs to get done."" These are some of the likely focus areas for Biden's consumer watchdog.

Covid crisis

The Covid crisis will likely be the bureau's top priority according to consumer experts and former agency officials. The pandemic tipped the U.S. economy into the deepest recession since the Great Depression and with historic speed. Millions of families were estimated to have slipped into poverty by year's end. ""Covid has created a new set of problems or emphasized and underscored ongoing problems for consumers"" Cordray said.

Americans may turn to financial firms for help whether to seek various relief or new loans to cover expenses. The CFPB will likely implement more safeguards to ensure consumers get adequate (and promised) support. That work will fall in two primary areas said Patricia McCoy a professor at Boston College Law School.

For one the agency could ensure financial firms and debt collectors honor government protections like the national ban on evictions until March and the payment pause for student loan borrowers through September. It may also uphold firms' voluntary commitments to all types of borrowers like homeowners car buyers and credit-card users for example. ""That will be a top top top priority"" said McCoy a former agency official during the Obama administration.

Debt collection

In a similar vein the agency will also likely try to overturn or rewrite Trump-era rules around debt collection according to consumer advocates. The prior administration issued two related rules toward the end of Trump's term one in October and another in December. Broadly they addressed how debt collectors may communicate with and disclose information to consumers. Kathy Kraninger the former CFPB head during the Trump administration said the measures helped keep consumers informed. However consumer advocates believe the rules gave companies too much power. ""At their core these were not rules for consumers"" said Rachel Gittleman financial services manager at the Consumer Federation of America.

The Trump-era policies allow debt collectors to hound consumers by calling them one time per day per debt Gittleman said. A consumer with five medical bills could receive 35 calls a week she said. There's also no limit on text or social-media messages. The rules also don't prohibit the collection of ""zombie debt"" according to the National Consumer Law Center. Debts sometimes fall outside a statute of limitations for collection — but consumers may accidentally revive this time-barred debt by making a small payment for example. That in turn frees up debt collectors to file lawsuits anew against a consumer.

Student loans

Under Biden the consumer bureau is expected to exercise greater enforcement of the rules on student loan servicing. Advocates have criticized student loan servicers for misleading borrowers and steering them into more expensive repayment plans. During the Obama years the bureau took legal action against Navient one of the largest servicers. (Navient denies any wrongdoing.) With Biden in the White House experts expect that lawsuit to be continued and pursued aggressively. Other changes under Biden could include mandating that loan servicers tell borrowers about all of their available options including economic hardship or unemployment deferments. And servicers that fail to do so could face penalties.

The consumer bureau will likely also take a harder stance against for-profit schools that have been known to prey on vulnerable students and make unrealistic promises. Enrollment at these schools usually increases in recessions and it has during the pandemic. ""It is time for the CFPB to use all of its tools to stand up for student loan borrowers including through enforcement actions creating stronger protections complaint monitoring and routine oversight of student loan companies"" said Seth Frotman executive director of the Student Borrower Protection Center who worked at the bureau from 2011 to 2018.

Credit reporting

Credit scoring companies typically have to investigate consumer complaints within 30 days to 45 days. But the Trump administration's CFPB said it wouldn't take enforcement action against the companies if they take longer to do so during the pandemic. That was the opposite of what the consumer agency should have done advocates say. They anticipate Biden's CFPB will pressure the credit rating companies to respond quickly and adequately to people's complaints of false and outdated information on their records. These reports can determine the interest rate someone gets on a new car loan or mortgage or if they're accepted into an apartment. It's clear people are running into challenges: More than half of the complaints that came into the CFPB between January 2020 and May 2020 were about credit reports.

Overdraft fees

In March as the public health crisis caused unemployment to soar federal regulators encouraged banks to waive their overdraft fees. Instead the average penalty has reached a record high of $33.47 a recent survey by Bankrate.com found. And checking account providers took in more than $30 billion in revenue from the fees alone in 2020 according to data provided to CNBC by financial research company Moebs Services.

Zoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards

When people are dinged with multiple fees they can be pushed out of the banking system and find it impossible to receive stimulus aid like direct payments and unemployment checks advocates say. The CFPB should move to limit the charges said Alex Horowitz senior research office at Pew's Consumer Finance Project. ""It could restrict overdraft practices that it deems unfair deceptive or abusive"" he said. ""An example might be a bank charging a customer many overdraft fees in a single day if a customer used a debit card several times.""

Payday loans

Some 12 million Americans take out a payday loan each year. These loans carry extremely high interest rates for consumers — locking some in a vicious cycle of debt. Last year the Trump administration rescinded parts of a 2017 rule issued by Cordray the CFPB head under President Obama that sought to rein in potentially harmful payday-loan practices.

There are potentially a dozen two dozen priorities. There's a lot that needs to get done. Richard Cordray former director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau

For example the measure removed mandatory underwriting provisions (which had yet to take effect) that would have prohibited lenders from issuing money to consumers without first assessing their ability to repay the loan. ""I'd be shocked if the CFPB didn't get rid of that"" McCoy the former agency official said of that measure.

She's still unrelenting in her quest to get better.,"Angela Stanford stayed with her family across the street from Champions Golf Club during the 75th U.S. Women’s Open. When she walked in the door after a gut-wrenching opening round of 80 her parents were sitting on the couch and her dad Steve had already opened up a Coors Original.

“You want one of these?” he asked offering up a beer.

“Yeah” Stanford replied.

Such a fickle game. Four days prior the trio had been on top of the proverbial mountain in suburban Dallas with Angela winning on the LPGA for the first time in front of her parents at the Volunteers of America Classic. Now with expectations and emotions running as high as the clouds Stanford hit the opening tee shot in her home state of Texas – “God’s country” as she calls it – and proceeded to play the first four holes in six over par.

Double bogey bogey double.

The heart that once swelled so big it could bust was ripped out in about an hour.

“Standing over a par putt on the fifth hole I’m just praying and begging for this 3-footer to go in” said Stanford. “I’m like I’ve got to make a par.”

In a way the fact that it was so bad almost made it easier to get over. A missed put on Friday to miss the weekend by one might have stung even harder.

Still learning how to deal with moments that run high on emotion remains something of an enigma to Stanford. And at 43 she’s perfectly fine with having questions about her game that remained unanswered. The fact that there’s still so much left to unlock is what drives her to want more after two decades on tour.

“I love that I’ve been a late bloomer” she said. “I love that it takes me a little bit longer than most. I tell people I’m slow at everything except when I get behind the wheel.”

After the 2020 season came to an end – she’s still vexed that she hasn’t figured out how to play Tiburon Golf Club site of the CME Group Tour Championship – Stanford put her clubs away and headed north to Pagosa Springs Colorado where she has a little place and likes to ski at Wolf Creek. She also spent time on the slopes with friends in Vail and then flew to Montana to ski some more.

Stanford has skied for a long as she can remember taking road trips with her family to Red River New Mexico. Skiing she said is the only thing she can do that truly gets her away from golf.

“There’s something about being on a ski lift the quiet and the peace” she said. “For me it’s a spiritual thing.”

Friends gave her a hard time for having the shortest skis. She might be the best skier in the group but the seven-time LPGA winner knows her limitations and she stays within them.

Going into the season-opening Diamond Resorts Tournament of Champions Stanford hit fewer than a dozen balls into a net. She has a putting mat and a weighted club at her home in Colorado and she poured through statistics looking for new goals for the 2021 season.

But for the most part she went into the TOC with zero expectations and finished tied for fifth. The real work on her game gets started in offseason No. 2 as the tour takes a month off before returning to Orlando in late February. (Stanford does have one more ski trip to Park City planned.)

For 2021 Stanford told instructor Todd Kolb that she wanted to go about her goals differently this time around.

“If you look at my history” she said “I’ll win and then I’ll play bad … disappear for months. I’ve got to figure out what’s going on there.”

While Stanford has long prided herself on being a consistent player it frustrates her that she has never come close to winning the Vare Trophy for low scoring average.

“You can be consistently average” she concluded.

The fact that Stanford isn’t afraid to look in the mirror at this stage in her career and honestly assess what needs to improve makes Kolb’s job that much easier. He’s not one to sugarcoat either.

“Let’s just get after it” said Kolb who points to two specific stats that draw a direct line to Stanford’s success.

The first: average length of her first putt after a missed green.

“I always tell people chipping differentiates” said Kolb.

The second: tracking her conversion rate on birdie putts from 9 to 15 feet.

“That’s the range that great players are hitting it when they’re hitting the ball well” he said.

Stanford a Solheim Cup assistant captain who might end up playing has greatly enjoyed her weekly Zoom chats with fellow assistant Michelle Wie and captain Pat Hurst. She downplays whether or not she’ll be hitting shots in Toledo.

For someone who isn’t really into stats Stanford has found that being aware of where she stands with certain numbers helps her to maintain focus during rounds. Keeping a running count of total putts and fairways hit at the TOC for example kept her in the present with mini-goals.

There is one goal however that’s so big that she hasn’t even put it down on paper.

“If you talk to anybody this year and they don’t mention playing the Olympics” said Stanford “then they’re lying. So I don’t want to lie to you. Playing in the Olympics is a dream for every athlete … that’s probably the long shot.”

She won he first major at age 40.

This round of investment institutions include: CMS Holding Altonomy SevenX Zonff Partners Paka Timestop Capital Incuba Alpha Oasis Capital Kernel Capital and Loopring co-founders Jay and Steve Guo and other individual investors. Seed round investment institutions SNZ Holding and DFG continue to make additional investments.

After Bifrost completed the round of financing it experienced rapid development accumulated new community members advanced its products gained in-depth cooperation partners and established a solid roadmap in just a few months. It shows the growth and transformation that Bifrost has experienced. With some hard work starting in 2020 Bifrost has now completed more than 80% of the basic function development. By March 2021 the last version of the Asgard CC4 testnet will have been released before the mainnet.

As the significant pledge derivative protocol in the Polkadot ecosystem Bifrost already has over 8200 active on-chain addresses. They participate in the contribution of the Bifrost ecosystem through testnet incentives cross-chain testing bug fixing article writing content translation etc. In the Asgard testnet there were a total of 1231 nodes from seven countries that participated and the number of online nodes reached 890. There were 66385 times of EOS cross-chains during the testnet. .

Three days before Ethereum 2.0’s Beacon Chain launch Bifrost launched the Eth2 staking derivative vETH as well as the first phase of vETH called Mint Drop. The highest mint amount was 15088.7563 vETH and Bifrost cooperated with layer-two protocol network Loopring both promoted vETH liquidity which exceeded $900000 liquidity in Ethereum layer-two network. In general vETH will be launched in four stages. Before the Bifrost mainnet goes online vETH will already be on Ethereum’s layer one and its layer two accumulated the initial liquidity scale and a stable discount rate of 5%–10% which shows the market’s recognition of the decentralized acceptance of vETH. As soon as Bifrost mainnet goes online these vETH will become the first batch of cross-chain assets entering the Polkadot ecosystem. Bifrost is looking forward to connecting with Kusama and Polkadot in the near future.

After undergoing a transformation from zero to one Bifrost is about to usher in growth from one to 100. Today Bifrost is proud to announce that it has received a new round of financing of $1.55 million. New strategic partners Altonomy and Loopring help Bifrost to build liquidity for pledged derivatives and link global resources for Bifrost on the market financing and strategy levels.

The government may give Cairn Energy one of the surrendered oil fields such as Ratna R-Series in lieu of the USD 1.4 billion it has pay to the British firm helping prevent seizure of foreign assets in case of default as well as get a experienced operator in struggling E&P sector sources said.Cairn Energy gave India its biggest onland oil discovery but exited the country after it was slapped with a Rs 10247-crore tax demand using a legislation that gave the government the powers to tax companies retrospectively. The firm has now won an international arbitration against the tax demand and the government has been ordered to return the value of shares of Cairn it had sold dividends it had seized and tax refund it had withheld to recover the tax demand.For a government struggling to find revenue to boost a COVID-19 battered economy options of appeal against the arbitration award are limited and it may not have the financial bandwidth for such a payout two sources with knowledge of the development said.""One option is to give Cairn one or more of the oil and gas fields that the government now owns after they are surrendered by operators for various reasons"" one of them said. ""The government could give the Ratna and R-Series oil and gas field in the Arabian Sea that taken away from Essar Oil-Premier Oil consortium in 2016 because contractual terms had changed.""The Barmer oilfield in Rajasthan which was originally discovered by Cairn Energy could be another option. Vedanta Ltd  which now operates the field after it bought out Cairn's Indian subsidiary a decade back has so far not agreed to the government conditions for getting an extension of contract beyond its original end day of May 2020.Under Vedanta which continues to operate the field on monthly extensions till its legal challenge to government conditions is settled Rajasthan oilfields have seen steady decline in output.""It's a win-win - the government settles it liability without paying a single penny or upsetting investor sentiments by not honouring the arbitration award through endless legal challenges and at the same time getting back an established exploration and production (E&P) firm back"" another source said.No major oil and gas discovery has been made in the past seven years since the retrospective tax demand was raised.In case the government chooses not to honour the arbitration award it risks the prospect of its assets in foreign countries being seized just jike US oil firm ConocoPhillips did with Venezuela to recoup muti-billion dollar of compensation awarded in arbitration.Earlier this month Cairn Energy's chief executive officer Simon Thomson wrote to the Indian government that the arbitration ruling is final and binding and failure to comply would breach the international rules.""As India is a signatory to the New York Convention the award can be enforced against Indian assets in numerous jurisdictions around the world for which the necessary preparations have been put in place"" according to the letter referring to the 1959 Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards.Earlier this month Malaysia's government had impounded a plane owned by state carrier Pakistan International Airlines on a court order due to a UK court dispute with aircraft lessors.While Cairn didn't mention any Indian asset in its letter sources said assets could include bank accounts of its diplomatic missions non-diplomatic premises planes of state carrier Air India and state-owned ships in the UK Netherlands France Canada and the US.Cairn Energy has asked the Indian government for an early indication of implementing the arbitration award well before the announcement of its full year earnings on March 9 for clarity of its shareholders according to the letter.The tax authorities had in January 2014 slapped with an initial assessment of unpaid taxes of Rs 10247 crore over a restructuring carried out in 2006 while preparing for an initial public offering of Cairn India. The tax authorities in 2015 seized Cairn Energy's residual shareholding of about 10 per cent of Cairn India then valued at about USD 1 billion.The Edinburgh-based company filed a dispute under the UK-India Investment Treaty and sought international arbitration that started later in 2015 for the losses over expropriation of its investments in India from the minority holding.During the pendency of the arbitration the government also seized dividends totalling Rs 1140 crore due from its minority holding in Cairn India (now merged with Vedanta Ltd) and set off a Rs 1590-crore tax refund against the demand.The three-member tribunal which comprised a judge appointed by India last month unanimously overturned a Rs 10247 crore retrospective tax demand on Cairn and asked the Indian government to return value of the shares it sold dividend it seized and tax refunds it stopped to enforce the tax.The tribunal ruled the 2006 reorganisation of Cairn Energy's India business prior to listing on local bourses was not ""unlawful tax avoidance"" and ordered tax authorities to drop the tax demand which was levied following a 2012 amendment to the Income Tax Act that gave authorities powers to seek taxes on past deals.It ordered the government to return the value of shares it had sold dividends seized and tax refunds withheld to recover the tax demand along with interest. Also it was asked to reimburse the cost of arbitration. All this totalled to USD 1.25 billion plus interest. Together with interest the total due is USD 1.4 billion.The government in response to the arbitration award had stated that it will study the order and ""consider all options and take a decision on the further course of action including legal remedies before appropriate fora"".Sources said the options before the Indian government were limited. An appeal against the award in a court in The Hague - the seat of the arbitration panel - may not yield positive results as the tribunal had given a very detailed 582-page order to make it ""as bullet-proof"" as possible.An appeal in Supreme Court against the Cairn arbitration award too may be futile as it remains to be seen if the Indian top court has jurisdiction to stay an award of an international tribunal they said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVuZXJneWZtLm5ldC9jbXMvbmV3c19zdG9yeV82NjE0NTcuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Consultation launched on e-bikes and e-scooters,"Consultation launched on e-bikes and e-scooters

Ramsey Commissioner Juan McGuinness says it makes sense to look at updating local authority legislation in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.

It follows calls for Tynwald to modernise laws set out in the Local Government Act 2006.

Current rules prevent authorities from ratifying decisions remotely.

What’s legend and what’s true isn’t really clear but what is evident is that Cobb was one of MLB’s top stars at the time of his retirement.

Of course Cobb didn’t play at a time when professional athletes made millions as they do today. The center fielder was able to parlay his earnings into quite a hefty payday but it was due to a savvy investment decision he made.

The MLB career of Ty Cobb

Cobb played in an era before the home run became as popular as it is today. During most of Cobb’s career home runs were a much rarer occurrence. According to Baseball Reference Cobb retired after 24 seasons and 4189 hits.

He spent most of his career as a member of the Detroit Tigers though he did log time as a member of the Philadelphia Athletics.

The slugger retired with a career batting average of .366 the highest career average of all time. He won an MVP Award 12 batting titles and a Triple Crown. Cobb was also part of the first class of Hall of Famers when the institution opened.

The numbers are impossible to deny: Cobb was one of the sport’s most influential figures from its early days. He set the standard for contact hitters after him like Pete Rose and Ichiro Suzuki.

Ty Cobb’s philanthropic efforts

Cobb left a complicated legacy. While rumors persisted about some uglier sides of his personality for years it was proven that the man had a philanthropic side.

According to WealthManagement.com Cobb set up a scholarship fund in his name. He believed all baseball players should receive an education before turning pro and saw to it that both of his sons attended Ivy League universities.

Of course Cobb’s charitable efforts were largely helped due to the massive fortune he amassed. But believe it or not baseball wasn’t the source of much of Cobb’s riches. There would be a much savvier financial decision he’d make that would help him in that regard.

An early investment set Cobb up for life

Investing can be a tough gambit for professional athletes. If they trust their money with the right adviser they can make it last for years. A mistake could leave them destitute. Cobb was a fairly successful investor and one of his best investments came from a company we all know today: Coca-Cola.

According to a Yahoo article speculating whether Cobb was the most famous athlete investor of all time he made over $491000 during his playing days (the equivalent of around $7.4 million today).

Check from my check collection: This day in 1958 Ty Cobb writes a check to a Coca Cola bottling plant in Palo Alto a few miles from his mansion.



At the time this check was written Cobb was worth about $100 million in today’s dollars — a large part from Coca-Cola stock. pic.twitter.com/08vuv9hswl — Darren Rovell (@darrenrovell) June 14 2021

Cobb died with over $12.1 million in his investment portfolio — equivalent to over $104 million today. In 1907 he bought 300 shares of stock in Coca-Cola. Over the next 20 years he expanded that to 24000 shares. When Cobb died he owned $2.1 million worth of Coca-Cola stock.

Coca-Cola wasn’t the only winning company Cobb invested in. He also invested in a company called United Motors which later converted to General Motors stock.

Cobb showed that the same acumen he displayed for baseball he had for investing. It’s how his off-the-field earnings were able to dwarf what he was paid for playing baseball.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiK2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpZGVvcGVuY291bnRyeS5jb20vZGlldC1wZXBzaS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Diet Pepsi Isn't Healthier Than Regular Pepsi and Here's Why,"You might think that eating or drinking something with the word ""diet"" in the name would be healthier for you but when it comes to diet soda like Diet Pepsi Diet Coke or other diet colas that's just not the case. It's not particularly nutritious for starters and drinking Diet Pepsi or other diet sodas might even lead to other health issues. Diet Pepsi isn't really healthier than regular Pepsi and there are a few reasons why.

What Makes Soda Like Diet Pepsi a ""Diet"" Soda?

Diet sodas are generally made with artificial sweeteners like aspartame cyclamates saccharin acesulfame-k or sucralose instead of sugar according to Healthline. But just because these sodas have low or no sugar or calories that doesn't make them technically healthier than regular soft drinks.

What Are Some Examples of Diet Soda?

There are lots of ""light"" or ""diet"" versions of sodas made by Pepsico and other companies — Diet Coke Coke Zero Pepsi Max Sprite Zero and more. You've probably seen some of your favorite sodas like Mountain Dew offering versions with zero calories or zero sugar.

Why Isn't Diet Pepsi and Other Soda Healthier?

""Diet soda is essentially a mixture of carbonated water artificial or natural sweetener colors flavors and other food additives"" Healthline explains. And while it might seem like drinking soda with no calories would aid in things like weight loss there are other risks to drinking it that negate some of the possible benefits.

""Several observational studies have found that using artificial sweeteners and drinking high amounts of diet soda is associated with an increased risk of obesity and metabolic syndrome"" Healthline notes.

""Regular soda is generally a mixture of carbonated water and sweeteners like high fructose corn syrup or sucrose; phosphoric acid if it's a dark cola; 'natural flavors;' and caffeine"" The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center reports. ""Most sugar substitutes are considered 'non-nutritive' meaning they offer little to no energy when consumed."" In other words they're not very nutritious and you might not be happy if you check the nutrition facts on the bottle.

Common ingredients in diet sodas like Diet Pepsi Pepsi Zero Sugar and Coca-Cola Light include citric acid malic acid and phosphoric acid — which are linked to the erosion of tooth enamel — as well as caramel color and preservatives like potassium benzoate that help the sodas last longer and preserves freshness. If you're trying to avoid those things Diet Pepsi is certainly not healthier than regular soda.

Ultimately the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) allows companies like Pepsi and the Coca-Cola company to use the term ""diet"" or ""light"" for these drinks and don't consider the labeling to be misleading. But that doesn't mean sodas or energy drinks that are labeled ""diet"" should be automatically considered healthier than their usual counterparts.

As always check the label and make a determination on what's best for you and your diet.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdzbWFyZW5hLmNvbS9mbGFzaGJhY2tfd2VpcmRfcGhvbmVzX2Zyb21fdW5leHBlY3RlZF9icmFuZHNfY29jYWNvbGFfYmljX2tmY19nYXJtaW4tbmV3cy00NzQ4MS5waHDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Flashback: weird phones from unexpected brands part 3 - Coca-Cola Bic KFC Garmin,"In the previous Flashback post we mentioned that Ericsson produced a special Coca-Cola edition phone. And this was years before the Pepsi phone mind you. But we won’t just focus on beverage-branded phones today instead we’ll go for general weirdness. Here are some more weird phones from unexpected brands.

The phone with a sweet tooth

Launched at the end of 2000 a year after the “unflavored” model became available the Ericsson A1018s Coca-Cola special edition arrived in the UK. This wasn’t available to just anyone oh no you had to earn it.

And by “earn it” we mean that you had to collect 60 ring pulls from Coke cans and/or phone tokens (paper tokens you could find attached to select bottles).



The Ericsson A1018s Coca-Cola special edition (image credit)

What you get in return was a promotional package with extensive Coca-Cola branding. This includes the phone itself which had a branded front panel the carrier logo on the screen was also swapped out. Even better the pre-loaded ringtone played the Coca-Cola theme but that was about it.

There are a few of these phones – and their original packaging – on eBay if you want to add one to your collection.

The disposable phone

When you hear the Bic brand name do you think pens or disposable razors? Whoever is responsible for this next item was thinking the latter – meet the Bic Phone a disposable phone marketed in France and Spain by Orange.

It was really an alcatel OT-S210 with the Bic Boy painted on (Bic was barely involved in this it just collected royalty payments for lending its name). Anyway here’s the idea behind this questionable gadget.



The (not quite) disposable Bic Phone

The Bic Phone would sell for €19 and come with a charged battery and 10 minutes of talk time. The battery would last up to 4 hours of calls (and you could listen to FM radio). The battery was easy to recharge over microUSB but recharging the minutes was a much bigger hassle.

You had to mail a registration form to Orange once accepted this added 50 minutes of talk time. Afterwards more minutes could be added with Mobicarte vouchers. So this isn’t really disposable but also not something meant for long-time use. It was something you would buy at the airport use up and stick in a drawer for the rest of time.

Considering that there’s a growing support for reducing electronic waste you’d think that the Bic Phone was something from the 90s or even 80s. Nope Orange concocted this idea in 2008.

The phone with 11 herbs and spices

Colonel Sanders has a secret recipe for fried chicken but we never expected him to cook up a smartphone. And yet in 2017 that’s just what he did – KFC was celebrating its 30 year anniversary since opening its first store in China and launched an Android-powered phone for super fans (based on the Huawei Enjoy 7 Plus).



Hand-breaded freshly-prepared finger-lickin' good... Huawei smartphone

Only 5000 units were made and they were available through a special page on Tmall or through the KFC app. This app was really the star of the show – it came pre-loaded on the phone and was popular because it allowed users to order and pay through their phone. Any phone mind you not just the KFC one. Not bad even if not quite amazing for 2017.

The K-music app was even more interesting. It put users in control of the music playlist in the KFC restaurant they were visiting – the company boasted 4000 KFC locations in China at the time.

The phone that was a SatNav

Well two phones actually. Have you heard the term “SatNav”? It stands for Satellite Navigation and refers to digital devices that use GPS (and similar positioning systems) to offer driving directions. Yes just like every smartphone under the Sun today.



The Asus-Garmin Nuvifone G60 was all about satellite navigation

But this was 2009 and digital maps still required expensive purchases and subscriptions (this was before Nokia dropped the bomb). Garmin had a long history of building GPS devices – anything from hand-held receivers to plane cockpits – while Asus brought in the phone know-how. A match made in heaven.



The nuvifone G60 ran a custom Linux-based OS

Two phones were demoed at MWC 2009 (check out our report from then). The Garmin-Asus nuvifone G60 had a 3.55” resistive touchscreen (272 x 480 px) ran a custom Linux distro and had 4GB of on-board storage (plus a microSD slot maps can be huge if you want to traverse a whole continent).

The other was the Garmin-Asus nuvifone M20 a Windows Mobile 6.1 device (later updated to 6.5). It had a smaller but much sharper display 2.8” with 480 x 640 px resolution and was powerd by an early Qualcomm chipset (528 MHz CPU).



The Garmin-Asus nuvifone M20 was smaller and ran Windows Mobile

Both had on-board GPS receivers of course as well as a compass. The loudspeaker lived up to its name as a voice blasted from it giving you turn-by-turn directions. There was also Ciao! which was billed as a “location-based social networking” app. Its main feature was the ability to share your location with your friend (who could then use their Garmin device to navigate your location).



A look around the nuvifone M20

Anyway the following year the two companies released the nuvifone A50 an Android 2.1 Eclair phone and the nuvifone M10 another Windows Mobile device. They featured Garmin’s PhotoReal Junction View. No not like Street View a 3D rendering of the junction but still quite useful.

That wraps it up for today but there are other weird gadgets to cover in future installments - we can almost taste them... okay we should probably lay off the junk food smartphones.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vZHJhbXNjb3RsYW5kLmNvLnVrLzIwMjEvMDEvMzAvY29jYS1jb2xhLWFubm91bmNlcy1vcGVuLXRvLWJldHRlci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Coca-Cola announces ‘Open To Better’,"Coca-Cola has announced the launch of ‘Open To Better’ a campaign to inspire people to embrace change and pledge to do things differently in 2021.

We have launched the ‘Open’ platform a campaign highlighting how the world has changed and to appreciate what perhaps was previously taken for granted.”"

I as a native of South Teso where Mr Obore also hails from have always been proud enlivened and immensely leveraged by his strong convictions about the need for political fairness rational resource allocation constitutionalism and quality service delivery for all. So popular and endeared was Mr Obore to the hearts of many ordinary wanainchi that he easily earned the rare admiration and respect usually reserved for only those destined for political martyrdom.

But alas Mr Obore appears to have metamorphosed into a completely new person now! I am particularly basing on his article in Daily Monitor of September 19 titled ‘Members of Parliament deserve decent burial’.

The overall tone of that article is that given the elite status of an MP his/her terms and conditions of service and because an MP is a high profile taxpayer a budgetary allocation of Shs68 million to meet the costs of his/her burial (upon their death) is both socially and economically justifiable! Really? I am yet to be convinced.

In fact I think from a purely human rights perspective that line of reasoning is out rightly repugnant. While I am cognizant of the inherent Animal Farm type of inequality that typifies human existence in Uganda it is insulting and morally inappropriate for anyone to insinuate that one human being “deserves” a super decent burial and another – by inference - does not.

By virtue of being homo sapiens any human being deserves a decent send off from earthly life upon his/her demise - his/her social political or economic status notwithstanding! By the way death is the only truly equalising factor in our terrestrial lives since a dead person is a dead person – a biological statistic at that! Any effort therefore to extend the inequalities that our top political brass have so religiously perpetrated when still living into our graves represents the highest form of human vanity and greed. Here is why.

First I am a believer in the principles of “contextualised” decision-making and economic rationality. When you are talking about a country such as Uganda with high income poverty levels shambolic social services poor physical infrastructure and a roundly shy national resource envelop a government mabugo grant of Shs68 million for the burial of an MP is obscenely too high.

In a country where stock outs of items as cheap as hand-gloves and panadol tablets in its health facilities is the order of the day; where primary school children still study under shade trees and complete primary cycle without having mastered the most basic literacy and numeracy competencies; where a sizeable percentage of the population is food insecure; and in a society which is still heavily reliant on the primitive hand hoe technology to propel its predominantly rain-fed subsistence agrarian economy that kind of wasteful expenditure on economically “very low-impact activities” is simply indefensible.

Uganda’s health sector budget allocation of Shs1.8 trillion (about 8 per cent of the national budget) for 2016/17 is still far below the 15 per cent Abuja benchmark. Similarly the Shs2.7 trillion allotment to education for 2016/17 is just a drop in the ocean when viewed against the backdrop of the huge resource demand-supply gaps in that sector. So where do we get this “excess” financial capacity to fund such lavish burials? It is not enough justification to simply say the Shs68 million was budgeted for! Public resource allocation decision-making always ought to be sensitive and responsive to the local contextual realities.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vbml0b3IuY28udWcvdWdhbmRhL29wZWQvbGV0dGVycy9vcGVuLWxldHRlci10by1pbnNwZWN0b3ItZ2VuZXJhbC1vZi1wb2xpY2UtMTY5NTc5MNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Open letter to Inspector General of Police,"Dear Inspector General of Police I will use this opportunity to condole with you for the untimely loss of the late Andrew Felix Kaweesi. I also want to commend Uganda Police Force for fairly executing its cardinal functions while being cognizant of the poor working conditions for many police officers.

I bring to your attention the issue of increased insecurity and organised crime in greater Masaka particularly in districts of Bukomansimbi and Lwengo. The sub-counties and parishes that have turned into hot spots of insecurity include Kitanda Bigasa Kibinge Kyabakuza Misanvu Buyoga and Kiryasaka etc.

Reports so far indicate two people brutally killed in what until now remain unknown attacks. Although nothing is known about the attackers its alleged that before the fierce attacks residents are supplied with threatening notices which has forced many to flee their homes for fear for their lives.

One victim of such attacks revealed to me through a phone conversation that the attackers use lethal weapons like machetes and axes to torture innocent civilians. Later the victim expressed fear that the areas under threat may soon be hit by hunger since many people have vacated their homes where they used to cultivate food for consumption.

IGP you and I know that at least the regime has always been credited for promoting and ensuring security for both life and property of its citizens more than the previous “despotic” regimes as the President calls them.

From what we are witnessing can you give us an account of the insecurity events unfolding every now and then with some shaking the Force you lead?

I have also learnt that following public outcry the President recently promised to beef up security in Bukomansimbi. However for how long shall we live on reactionary promises of the Head-of-State? Must we wait until hundreds of residents are massacred before we can become pro-active?"
CL,Colgate-Palmolive,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3c21ldGVyLmluL3RvcC1zdG9yaWVzL2NvbGdhdGUtYXNrZWQtdG8tcGF5LXJzMTVrLXRvLWN1c3RvbWVyLWZvci1jaGFyZ2luZy1ycy0xMjQwLWV4dHJhLWZvci10b290aHBhc3RlLTY3MzU1NdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Colgate asked to pay Rs.15K to customer for charging Rs. 12.40 extra for toothpaste,"Hyderabad: The consumer dispute redressal commission Sangareddy has slapped a fine of Rs. 50000 on Colgate Palmolive Co. for charging Rs. 12.40 extra from the customers for a tube of Colgate Max Fresh Gel toothpaste. Colgate has also been asked to pay Rs. 15000 compensation to the customer for causing inconvenience and mental agony.

The complainant Ch. Nagender (67) a resident of Prashanth Nagar purchased a Max Fresh toothpaste (150 gms) for Rs. 92 from Reliance Fresh Kalvakunta. ""Earlier I had purchased the same toothpaste at Rs. 20 for 50 grams. The price variation for 150 gm and 50 gm is Rs. 32. Colgate is minting money from the general public by cheating"" Mr. Nagender alleged.



The complainant also issued a legal notice and the same was served but there was no reply from the opposite party.



Replying to the allegation of the consumer the company said ""The manufacturer has the liberty to determine a suitable MRP for a product. Toothpaste may be a necessary product but it is not declared as an essential commodity under the law. Hence the manufacturer can determine the price after taking into consideration various factors such as manufacturing marketing and supply chain costs. It is incorrect to allege that fixing the price of Colgate Max Fresh Red Gel at Rs. 92 amounts to fraud and deficiency of service without any reasonable basis or proof.""



It also added that the company with the intent of attracting the consumers to purchase the product valued it at a concessional rate of Rs. 10 for 20 grams. ""The company is entitled to fix different prices for different products different quantities/sizes of the same product etc. The same is done to attract various consumers who have different needs/requirements. It has the right to have different pricing structures for its different products as per law of the land. Hence it is incorrect to allege that there is fraud deficiency of service or that is an unfair trade practice"" said Coalgate.



After hearing the arguments the forum said ""The customer bought the product at Rs. 87.40 from Reliance Fresh with a discount lesser than the original price of Rs. 92. Also the company has not fixed MRP proportionately to 150 gms Colgate Maxfresh. If 20 grams of Colgate Max Fresh toothpaste costs Rs. 10 the cost of 150 grams of Colgate Maxfresh Toothpaste will be Rs. 75.""



The commission also observed that the legal notice was served to the opposite party but it had not replied. ""This attitude of the opposite parties clearly shows negligence on their part"" said the commission.



Also the commission said the manufacturers will have to incur more money for manufacturing five small 20 grams Colgate packs than manufacturing 100 gms packs. In India most people have family-oriented behavior and toothpaste is also part of the monthly grocery. Middle-class families normally purchase big packs for their monthly use.



""It may be true that Colgate has the freedom to fix the MRP for different products but it cannot charge different prices for the same product of the same quantity whether they are small or big packets. We are of the opinion that the opposite party has not fixed the MRP in proportion to its quantity. Such an act of the opposite party amounts to unfair trade practice"" said the commission.



The commission directed Colgate to return an amount of Rs. 12.40 which was collected in excess from the complainant. The forum also asked the company to pay a sum of Rs. 10000 as compensation causing mental agony and trauma to the complainant and Rs. 5000 towards costs of litigation. The forum asked Colgate to pay Rs. 50000 towards damages to the consumer welfare fund.

CMCSA,Comcast,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnR1c2NhbG9vc2FuZXdzLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvMDEvMzAvY29tY2FzdC1pbnZlc3RzLWJ1aWxkaW5nLWxvY2FsLWNvcmUtY2FwYWNpdHkvNDI4NDU3MTAwMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Comcast invests in building local core capacity,"Tuscaloosa is now hot-wired to a fiber-optic motorway like ones that zip through technologically progressive Southern cities such as Atlanta Nashville Chattanooga Charleston and Savannah as Comcast recently upgraded its core system to offer up to 10 gigabit per second (Gbps) Internet speeds and ethernet private-line service.

""We're always looking for mid-market enterprise opportunities where we want to make this investment"" said Michelle Pluskota vice-president of services for Comcast Business in its Big South region which covers eight states.

While looking for rising spots ""We saw Tuscaloosa as really an up-and-coming market that's experiencing growth"" she said noting the Druid City rose to the top of their list for 2021. ""This is next-generation level technology.""

The new services are being offered to hundreds of local businesses schools hospitals and government agencies those with the largest data requirements.

""It's a 100-percent fiber-delivered product that is also symmetrical so you get the same speed up as you get down"" she said ""for the most robust technology users.""

Though the higher speed higher sophistication services are being offered for now just to those high-end users the ripple effect could eventually extend to boost speed and capacity for individuals.

""When we're putting more investment into a city it then makes it a more likely candidate for additional future upgrades"" Pluskota said. ""It's rudimentary: Once the road is built you can add on all these other things to it. Once we're in we're going to keep working it get to every potential customer that we can.""

Chattanooga known as ""Gig City"" for its forward-thinking approach to information technology eventually upgraded from an originally focused 10 gigabit service to making that greater capacity available throughout the community. And Comcast's continually working on increases said Sara Jo Walker director of public relations for Comcast South.

""We are always increasing our speed"" Walker said. ""That's something we're very proud of and is very important to us especially now with individuals using dozens of devices at home.""

This upgraded core could make the difference from something like a couple of cars trundling down a blue lane road into metropolis-style traffic jetting swiftly up-and-down a multi-lane autobahn Pluskota said.

Not only can large files and other data be shared and stored more easily but the upgraded services can provide redundancies. In case of a power loss a weather or other emergency something that keeps a business from connecting in an ordinary fashion the more sophisticated system will re-route to networks via an alternate route. It's something like a GPS re-calculating your trip down a different highway when the usual one is blocked by an accident or roadwork. In the aftermath of a tornado for example or as recently in the downtown Nashville bombing business services wouldn't have to be suspended.

Much like actual physical roads along with water power and the like high-capacity internet service has become part of any growing city's infrastructure said Barkley P. Garrett vice-president of economic development for the Chamber of Commerce of West Alabama.

""It's incredibly important especially to our business community"" he said ""that we have the speed and capacity that this technology is going to bring. With everything that we're doing we're using up more and more bandwidth.

""On one hand it's a speed issue but it's also a capacity issue. This (upgrade) can connect multiple sites of businesses so they can be able to push data back and forth from those sites. Businesses such as Mercedes and their supplier networks need large capacity bandwidth to share engineering files and those type of documents.""

The pandemic helped underline the need for speed he added as hospitals and healthcare providers share medical images and files changing download and upload speeds from hours to seconds. The growing telehealth market could also benefit from greater and easier access.

Keeping up with the state-of-the-art's crucial also in retaining businesses and employees and recruiting new companies to the area.

""It is critical that we have the best state-of-the-art technology so that we can embark upon those research opportunities that will be the most relevant and provide the greatest economic and societal benefit"" said Dan Blakley of the University of Alabama's office for economic and business engagement.

Keeping literally up to speed can support innovation and entrepreneurship as students and faculty pursue new projects and possibly spin off companies that won't have to relocate to a bigger city for its tech benefits.

""Chattanooga's kind of the poster child for this"" Blakley said. ""They made an investment early on in speed."" That investment's paid off in the southeastern Tennessee city's success its placement on lists of emerging markets for startups competing alongside much-larger metro areas such as Atlanta or Nashville. With a population of about 180000 the city in the shadow of Lookout Mountain is more closely analogous to Tuscaloosa with its roughly 100000 population.

Along with multiplied speed and capacity the new service offers options for businesses Walker said. They include:

• Ethernet Private Line: Point-to-point connectivity between two customer sites for bandwidth-intensive applications.

• Ethernet Virtual Private Line: Point-to-multipoint connection to enable customers to tailor bandwidth performance characteristics and cost.

• Ethernet Network Service: Multipoint-to-multipoint connectivity to connect organizations with high-bandwidth requirements and multiple locations across the network.

• Ethernet Dedicated Internet: Continuous high-bandwidth connectivity between customers’ LANs and the public Internet.

Of course Comcast is doing this as a business decision Garrett said so while the increase represents a boon for Tuscaloosa it's really a win-win for business.

""There had to be a return on investment for this offering"" he said. ""It is not cheap to install fiber and certainly not to crank up speeds to this level.""

It's important for Gov. Kay Ivey and the state Legislature to improve efforts on universal connectivity he added because having high speed at one end of a connection functions best when the other end has the same. The pandemic has already altered the way we do business the way we educate and connect and whatever happens in the future some of those changes will likely remain.

""(The pandemic) has forced employers to send their people home and let them work from home"" he said. Studies indicate productivity has not only kept up but often increased. ""So you may need these types of speeds depending on what business you're in even at your home office. We need to continue to push the envelope on making these available.""

Aside from the more pragmatic reasons online gamers like his son will make their demands for increased capacity heard. Video gaming has become a $120 billion a year industry outpacing spending on even movies and music.

""(Gamers are) not going to be OK with 25 megabits per second. They're going to stretch the limits and complain about latency on that"" Garrett said laughing.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvam9uYXRoYW5iZXJyLzIwMjEvMDEvMzEvd291bGQtbmJjdW5pdmVyc2FsLWFuZC13YXJuZXJtZWRpYS1iZS1iZXR0ZXItb2ZmLXRvZ2V0aGVyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Would NBCUniversal And WarnerMedia Be Better Off Together?,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanberr/2021/01/31/would-nbcuniversal-and-warnermedia-be-better-off-together/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvam9uYXRoYW5iZXJyLzIwMjEvMDEvMzEvd291bGQtbmJjdW5pdmVyc2FsLWFuZC13YXJuZXJtZWRpYS1iZS1iZXR0ZXItb2ZmLXRvZ2V0aGVyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vYW5uYXJib3JvYnNlcnZlci5jb20vbmlnaHRtYXJlLWF0LXRoZS1wc3ljaC1lci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nightmare at the Psych ER,"I lived through a nightmare at the U-M Psychiatric Emergency Room. The pandemic made it worse but didn’t cause it. It happens to families there all the time.

My twelve-year-old son is aggressive. We’re not sure if it’s because he has a rare form of epilepsy or because of the medications he takes to control it but in October he was attacking family members ten to twenty times a day. So I brought him to the psych ER and asked for him to be admitted for help getting his behavior under control.

They took my son to a room in back and told me to wait in the waiting room. Parents could not visit their children I was told to protect the privacy of the other patients. But as long as he was in the ER I was still legally responsible for him–so I couldn’t leave the hospital building for more than two hours at a time.

I spent the next five days and nights waiting at the hospital. The psych ER’s waiting room was usually too crowded to do social distancing the soap dispenser had been removed from the bathroom and sleep was nearly impossible.

A hospital social worker told me that other people could sleep in the waiting room and I could do it too. But I’ve never been able to sleep in public places–not in planes on buses or in waiting rooms.

Since I wasn’t allowed to see my son and I am easy to reach each night I would slip out of the waiting room go home and try to sleep in my own bed. And every night at two or three in the morning I would get a phone call demanding that I return to the waiting room. If I didn’t come back right away they said they would call Child Protective Services.

—

I never got more than about three hours of sleep a night while my son was in the psych ER. Once when I came back after being called I tried sitting near the hospital’s front desk where the staff had told me that it would be easier to sleep. But it wasn’t. The room was fully lit people were talking and at 4 a.m. a loud floor-washing Zamboni drove through.

I don’t think anybody ever intended for patients to spend five days in the psych ER waiting room. But while the doctors agreed that my son needed to be hospitalized no beds were available anyplace in the state.

This was not due to Covid. Long before the pandemic Michigan had far more psychiatric patients who needed to be hospitalized than places to treat them resulting in long waits for care.

According to an Mlive.com article last year since the early 1990s the number of psychiatric beds in Michigan has fallen by more than half to just 3200. The head of the state’s largest private provider explained that insurance pays a third as much for psychiatric hospitalization as it does for medical care making it a “black hole into which you dump money.”

The U-M has just three psychiatric beds for complicated adolescents like my son and they were full. The most likely alternatives were located up to an hour away and they were full too. I was told that if a bed did become available there my son would be transported in an ambulance but I would need to follow in my car check him into the new institution and then drive another hour back home again–all while sleep-deprived.

Between the risks of Covid infection and falling asleep at the wheel it felt like the rules were designed to kill parents several times over.

—

Eventually a space opened up in a U-M psychiatric ward and my son was admitted–he did not end up an hour away after all. Once he was hospitalized other patients’ privacy was no longer an issue: I was able to visit him–and to sleep at home at night.

There is nothing unusual about the hurdles we jumped to get him there. Other parents have told me that they too have waited days before their child was admitted.

Unfortunately not all families have the resources to do that. If family members cannot take time off work–or have other children at home or have medical problems of their own–that child may never get care.

I know because this was not the first time I’d tried to have my son admitted. The last time several years ago my other children were too young to be left alone at home. Unable to wait for a week in the ER I gave up and brought my son home without getting the help that he needed. We continued to live with his violence for years.

Having to spend days in the waiting room is one way to limit the demand for psychiatric hospitalization. But it doesn’t give priority to the children who need help the most–it gives priority to those whose parents are able to rearrange their lives to have someone on hand 24/7. This is not a reasonable way to ration health care!

Once he was admitted my son was hospitalized for two weeks. They changed his medication and for the moment his aggressive behavior is much less frequent. But he acclimates to some medications and they stop working and he has had life-threatening reactions to others so the current peace is not likely to last.

I worry that someday we will need to go back to the psych ER. And I dread that.

—

I filed a complaint with the hospital. My son’s pediatrician also tried to get them to change their policies so far without success. I wrote this article because I hope public attention will help.

Nobody should have to camp out for days to get a child the care they need. Parents need to be able to eat and sleep so that they can support their children.

The hospital needs a fairer way to ration psychiatric care–one that doesn’t limit it to families that are privileged enough to be able to take extended time off. And the state needs more psychiatric facilities so that in the future parents won’t have to spend days and nights in waiting rooms trying to sleep in chairs.

from Calls & Letters February 2021

To the Observer:

Your January article about the U-M Psych Emergency covered the patient’s side of the situation well but did you interview the nurses involved? These patient people often go home battered both mentally and yes physically too. In this case (and others) there are details left dangling that would more accurately characterize an essential clinic.

As for finding ideal spots to place less than ideal patients it’s well-know that with the closing of the once-busy Ypsi State Eloise and others the task must be incredible.

NBC Sports will continue with its television cycling coverage through the calendar year a network representative confirmed to Cyclingnews.

“NBC Sports is working with all of its partners on scheduling for 2022 and beyond” the statement noted.

US cycling fans have been able to watch the Tour de France and a selection of other top road races on the cable network since it was first launched in 1995 as Outdoor Life Network owned by Comcast. The network changed names several times becoming Versus in 2006 then NBCSN in 2011 the year Comcast bought NBC.

By 2020 NBC Sports provided coverage of the Tour de France on multiple networks not skipping a beat with the date change from summer to early fall for the Grand Tour due to the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic. Daily live coverage was provided across multiple platforms - NBCSN NBC Sports Gold a commercial-free live streaming service and Peacock Premium a new subscription-based streaming service.

The NBC Sports Gold “Cycling Pass” launched in 2016 currently offers a subscription through May 2021. With the reorganized cycling calendar last year subscribers had access to 12 races beginning in August with the Criterium du Dauphine and Tour de France. The Santos Tour Down Under was part of that scheduled lineup but the race was cancelled for 2021.

There are five races remaining on the “Cycling Pass” and current subscription information listed these as “TBD 2021.” It was not confirmed if this direct-to-consumer streaming product would be offered beyond this May or if subscribers would be compensated should these races be cancelled or rescheduled past May.

In addition to cycling some of the major properties to which NBC Sports Group has programming in the US includes the Olympic Games NFL NHL PGA TOUR IndyCar French Open and Kentucky Derby.

The Sports Business Journal noted that “properties like car shows dog shows and some motorsports will have to find new linear TV outlets” but made no specific mention of cycling events.

NBCSN has featured announcer Phil Liggett for the play-by-play of the Tour de France with Bob Roll supporting as an analyst.

Winter indoor track which has transformed locally into winter outdoor track with indoor facilities either closed or being used for other purposes has been conducted in fits and starts due to COVID quarantines the weather and the lack of a cohesive schedule.

But Saturday marked the first of what Ursuline and Iona Prep coach Jan Mitchell plans as a series of multi-team meets at Iona Prep the goal being simply to give teams a place to compete.

And despite the lack of jumps and relays the meet drew an overwhelmingly positive reaction.

""This is the first solid meet we've found"" said North Rockland head girls coach Steve Sutton who saw his squad and all teams in New York lose their track season last spring just days after Sutton took over the program.

""I was head coach a whole five days"" he said with a smile.

Already this season he has had four meets canceled so Sutton was happy his kids ""kicked some rust off their shoes"" Saturday.

""The smile on their faces after they were done ... They wanted to show they had something for all the effort and training they've done"" he said noting Red Raider track workouts began in November.

North Rockland senior Guerlorde Estabine seemed devoid of rust.

Estabine threw the shot put 35 feet 11 inches a one-foot personal best to win the event.

She was happy about that but moreover happy just to compete with COVID still a significant problem.

""They could have canceled the whole season"" Estabine said.

Her teammate junior Julia Howe ran 8.1 to win the girls 55 dash.

That was nowhere near her personal best but Howe was happy to run although noting ""My body was pretty cold.""

""It's definitely better for me (to race). When I get to spring I usually have a breakthrough from running in winter"" Howe said.

Ursuline finished with three varsity wins led by junior Daphne Banino who had quite a week.

Banino The Journal News/lohud Westchester/Putnam Girls Cross-Country Runner of the Year in the fall won the Con Ed Award Friday for her athletic academic and service achievements.

A day later she easily captured the girls 1500 clocking 4:47.82.

""I think the worst part is getting going"" Banino said of running in the cold.

Ursuline's Grace Long (11.49) won the girls 55 hurdles and teammate Maeve Ryan (13-05) the weight throw.

Running outside in January was ""definitely different and hard"" Pleasantville's Ava Horigan said even if she didn't make it look that way.

With a 28.12 clocking Horigan won the girls 200 and also set a personal-best mark in the event.

""I just wanted to do my best and run my hardest"" Horigan said of her pre-race goal.

Serena Henderson of New Rochelle ran 2:31.62 to win the girls 800.

Henderson was one of six New Rochelle athletes coach Andy Capellan brought to the meet but he said he intends to return next weekend (Saturday or Sunday depending on weather) with his full squad. Saturday's meet was only the second this season for his team he noted.

""Obviously with winter we're very excited for the opportunity to come down here"" added Pleasantville coach Tim Dirgins who brought 26 athletes and noted his team would also be back.

Iona Prep vs. Stepinac

Eight girls teams had athletes compete in the meet which was dubbed the Darin Gillenwater Classic after the longtime Iona Prep teacher and coach.

But more track went on there and elsewhere.

Competing at the Ocean Breeze indoor complex on Staten Island in a Catholic High School Athletic Association meet Iona Prep freshman Tommy Flynn junior Jordan Hargraves sophomore Antonio Bravo and junior Gabriel Maurad ran 8:41.43 to secure the sixth and final qualifying position to compete Feb. 13 in the New Balance Grand Prix in the boys 4x800 relay.

Back at their school other members of their team went head-to-head with local CHSAA rival Stepinac after the girls meet concluded.

Iona Prep won four out of six events.

Included was the 800 where junior Matthew Sidoti ran 2:14.1.

While multiple athletes layered on clothes Sidoti took a bare-arms/bare-legs approach.

""I don't like tights or anything"" he said.

But he does like a challenge.

Normally a 400 runner he noted Mitchell has been placing him in more 800s of late.

""I think I'm handling it pretty well"" said Sidoti who was pulled up to varsity his freshman year.

Teammate Chris Milillo won both the shot put (43-10) and weight throw (45-11) and Iona Prep's Robert Sanzo ran 26.11 to take the 200.

Scarsdale Village Manager Steve PappalardoScarsdale’s Village Manager Stephen M. Pappalardo has announced plans to retire in July 2021 after 30 years in Scarsdale. Pappalardo was promoted from Deputy Village Manager to Village Manager in 2015 when longtime Village Manager Al Gatta retired. Pappalardo shepherded the Village through many difficult situations including severe storms the 2016 tax revaluation legal challenges and the COVID outbreak. But it wasn’t all crisis management. Under his stewardship the Village undertook a major renovation and expansion of the library and launched sustainability initiatives that are now being replicated in other towns. In addition he got Con Edison to agree to pay for extensive road repaving in the Village when they disrupt roadways for installation and repair of gas lines.

Commenting on his decision to retire Pappalardo said “It has been an honor and a privilege to have worked for the Village of Scarsdale for the past 30+ years and I will forever be grateful for the opportunity afforded me by the Village Board to serve as your Village Manager for the past five. My positive professional experiences working for the Village are too numerous to list as are the many wonderful people I have encountered many of whom have enriched me and influenced my life both professional and personally. I consider myself fortunate and it has truly been a great career in public service for the Village.

Mayor Marc Samwick commented “Steve’s leadership professionalism and fiscal stewardship have not only resulted in the Village of Scarsdale being recognized in municipal government circles as a model for local governance but his efforts to maintain and enhance Scarsdale’s broader reputation as a great place to live and raise a family have yielded meaningful results in that our local quality of life has continued to remain in the top tier of suburban communities regionally and nationally throughout his over three decades of esteemed public service.” Mayor Samwick added “Steve has been – and will always be – a treasured member of the Scarsdale family.”

Although Manager Pappalardo will be retiring this year he is continuing to press forward on matters of local importance with a keen eye on the FY 2021-22 Annual Budget and other important work needing his focused attention. He related to the Village Board “. . . there is still much Village work to complete over the next five months and I remain fully committed to this effort. My July 12 2021 retirement date allows for the completion of the FY2021-22 budget process and the close of the finances for FY2020- 21. Both will better inform us toward a path forward for the Village government into the new June 01 2021 fiscal year and beyond as we transition from COVID-19 back to normal operations.”

We asked Pappalardo what he planned to do after he leaves Scarsdale and he made it clear that he has lots to accomplish before he steps down in July. He said “I’ve still got five months to go and much work to complete not the least of which is the most difficult budget in a decade. That being the case I plan on taking the summer months to consider my next move but I envision working in some capacity leaving time for family friends and hobbies.”",,,,,,

The international company – which has sites in Chandlers Ford Fareham and Eastleigh – will fund eight apprenticeships at smaller firms.

Under the government’s apprenticeship levy scheme large employers pay 0.5 per cent of their annual pay bill into a fund for use in training new and existing employees.

Any money they do not spend from that fund can be used to support apprenticeships with smaller employers.

The Transfer to Transform programme run by Solent Apprenticeship Hub connects organisations across the region to allow larger companies to support the training needs of smaller businesses.

CooperVision is the first company in the programme to fulfil its pledge.

Jeff Hummel senior HR director at CooperVision said: “We’re extremely proud to be able to play a part in supporting other organisations in the region and help enable them develop their apprenticeship training programmes.

“As a large employer not only in Hampshire but around the World CooperVision is passionate about creating bright futures and the opportunity to use the Transfer to Transform scheme to support others is something we didn’t hesitate to be a part of.”

Jodi Fair manager at the Solent Apprenticeship Hub said: “We are proud to receive the backing of an internationally renowned employer such as CooperVision who have a base located within the Solent region.

“This brings a weight to the initiative that was needed to receive the support of more levy paying employers.”

CooperVision creates 42 jobs with move to former Ford factory

CooperVision is a division of the CooperCompanies which was named in September of this year as number one in Europe and number two in the world in Fortune’s Best Large Workplaces in Manufacturing and Production 2020.

Coopervision plans 200 redundancies in Hampshire

Last year CooperVision revealed plans to make around 200 staff redundant at Hamble and Chandlers Ford. It said the layoffs were because of advances in manufacturing rather than the Covid-19 crisis and that it would still employ 2000 people at its Hampshire sites.

The company is part of the global medical device group Cooper Companies headquartered in San Ramon California which sells its products in more than 100 countries.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Glass reflects light. Glass is something we use every day as we cook use a computer decorate and so much more. Over the years our lives have been transformed by glass.

To learn more about the history art and science of glass plan a visit to the Corning Museum of Glass. Known as the Crystal City Corning is nestled in the beautiful Finger Lakes region of upstate New York. Corning sits between New York City which is a four- to five-hour drive and Niagara Falls which is a three-hour drive.

Corning Glass Works (now Corning Incorporated) established the museum in 1951 on its 100th anniversary as a company. A not-for-profit museum The Corning Museum of Glass is dedicated to exploring glass. Nearly half a million visitors from around the world visit each year to view the world’s most comprehensive glass collection. The Corning Museum of Glass is also one of the world’s top glassworking schools.

When I visited the Corning Museum of Glass I was amazed by how much there was to see and do. Here are some tips for a great experience at the Corning Museum of Glass.

1. Purchase Tickets Online

All tickets must be purchased in advance using the online system. Note that If you are traveling from another state you may be required by New York State to quarantine for 14 days. Please check the website to verify.

2. Plan Your Day (Or Days)

You can do a quick visit in three or four hours but it will be fast and you won’t have time to participate in the interactive areas. I would plan at least six hours. The ticket is a two-day admission for a reason.

On the first day I would suggest visiting the museum signing up for hands-on activities for the afternoon or following morning participating in the interactive exhibits watching some demonstrations and visiting the gift shop to see what is available.

Return the second day and view any things you missed. Enjoy the hands-on activities you signed up for and then return to the gift shop to make your final purchases. Don’t forget to pick up any items you created.

Be aware that you will need to return a few hours after creating a hands-on activity to pick up the finished product when it cools. When I visited I was given an assigned time. Since I completed the activity late in the day I had to pick up my completed project the following morning.

3. Free Parking Is Available

There is plenty of free parking for both cars and RVs and it is just a short walk from the entrance. There is also a free shuttle from the parking lot.

4. Enjoy Welcome Center Convenience

The museum’s welcome center is located in the main parking lot and is staffed heated and has restrooms and maps of the museum available for you.

5. Take The Museum Tour

You can tour the Corning Glass Museum on your own or with a guide. It is an informative educational and entertaining tour. I recommend the guided tour. I did the tour myself and more or less roamed around the building the first day I visited. The second time I took the guided tour and I realized how much I had missed the first time.

There are over 3500 years of glassmaking history in the galleries. You can enjoy small and large works of glass art. The Contemporary Art + Design Galleries house highlights 30 years in glass. The 500-seat Amphitheater Hot Shop is where you will be able to watch live glass demos.

6. Use The App

They now have an app that provides a tour. Bring your smartphone or tablet and headphones connect via free Wi-Fi and explore contemporary glass on the GlassApp. There is a great deal to enjoy in terms of glass mechanics and engineering glass history and glass art. (The app does not work until you are in the museum.)

7. Don’t Touch

Several large glass sculptures are displayed in open cases. The museum requests visitors to refrain from touching the artwork to help preserve it for future generations.

8. Skip The Phone Call

Avoid using your cell for calls while in the galleries. Visitors are asked to step outside for the duration of all calls.

9. Take Lots Of Photos

Photos are welcome unless otherwise indicated on specific displays. While photos are encouraged they ask that you do not use flash. Flash photography selfie sticks and tripods are not permitted in the galleries. Images taken in the museum may not be used for commercial purposes.

10. Get Charged Up!

There are over 43 charging stations located throughout the Museum campus for recharging mobile devices. Just connect and charge.

11. Watch The Live Demonstrations

Master glass artists transform molten glass into beautiful works of art. The Corning Museum of Glass enjoys sharing its passion for the art of glassmaking with visitors. Live demonstrations are available every day year-round and are included in the cost of admission.

Hot Glass Demos take place in the Innovation Hot Shop and are live narrated demonstrations lasting approximately 30 minutes.

The master glassmakers take a gob of glowing molten glass on the end of a pipe and use their skills to shape them into bowls vases or sculptures. There are cameras inside the 2300-degree furnace so you don’t miss a single step.

Flameworking Demos are held in the Glass Innovation Center and include a live narrated demonstration of glassworking at 5000 degrees with a gas- and oxygen- powered torch.

Expert flameworkers demonstrate the glassmaking technique and talk you through the process. During the demo you’ll see the flameworker melt the rods of glass and shape the softened glass into any variety of shapes from glass animals to beads to ornaments and sculptures.

12. Participate In A Hands-On Experience

Hands-on Make Your Own Glass experiences are fun engaging and a perfect way to preserve a memory. You can choose from the following experiences:

Glassblowing

Fusing

Sandblasting

These are fun activities for everyone regardless of age. No experience is necessary. Each activity lasts 20 to 40 minutes depending on the project.

When I visited it was in October and I participated in a glass blowing experience. I created a pumpkin that turned out beautifully:

These activities are popular and spots fill quickly. I recommend booking your experience online when you get your tickets. The hands-on experiences are an extra fee. Learn more in my piece on why glassblowing is an experience you should not pass up.

13. Visit The Corning Museum Of Glass Gift Shop

The Corning Museum gift shop is one of the largest in the country. You will find everything from Corelle bowls to glass bead necklaces Christmas decorations and lawn ornaments. There are many items and they range in cost from a few dollars to hundreds.

14. Use The Shuttle

After you visit the Corning Glass Museum ride the shuttle to explore the Rockwell Museum and Corning’s historic Gaffer District. The bus will return you to the welcome center and parking lot.

15. Visit The Rockwell Museum

The Rockwell Museum provides the story of the American experience through fine art. It’s a Smithsonian Affiliate museum located in Corning’s Old City Hall.

16. Enjoy The Downtown Area

I found the Gaffer District to be full of quaint shops and charming cafes. There were artist studios antique shops craft breweries and the Corning Incorporated World Headquarters where the original Corning Glass factory was located. I enjoyed browsing around a puzzle store that had more puzzles than you can imagine.

17. Stay The Night

There are several hotels just minutes from the museum. Many have special packages for Corning Museum of Glass visitors. You can check the hotel packages out here.

18. Go To The State Park

Watkins Glen State Park was named the third best state park by USA Today in 2015 and the second best New York attraction in 2018. It showcases 17 waterfalls and gorges. When I visited it poured down rain but was still beautiful.

19. Spend The Weekend

There is too much to see in the area to just stay one day — make it a weekend and enjoy the area. The surrounding Finger Lakes region boasts 11 beautiful lakes 120 wineries and many craft breweries and distilleries. It has quaint country inns eclectic college towns roadside markets and stunning views.

The F3 FCB as it’s popularly known has a technical profile that is almost identical to that of the F3. Apart from the FC Barcelona branding there are a couple of under-the-hood differences.

That said here is what the OPPO F3 FCB has to offer.

Highlights – Why you should consider buying it.

Design – FC Barcelona Branding

Dimensions: 153.3 x 75.2 x 7.3 mm

Weight: 153g

This is the obvious reason why you should buy the OPPO F3 FCB. FC Barcelona is one of the most popular football clubs in the world.

The OPPO F3 FCB features excellent FC Barcelona branding and it’s not just a device for the die-hard Barcelona fan but can also be an awesome collectible.

Powerful Performance Profile

Internal Memory: 64GB

Micro SD: Yes Expandable up to 128GB

You get a 1.5GHz Octa-Core chipset coupled with 4GB RAM. A powerful setup that is more than what is required to run Android 6.0.

In addition to that you get 64 GB of internal storage which is an ample capacity to meet the standard smartphone user storage needs.

Camera – Dual Cameras

Rear Camera: 13 MP

Secondary Camera: 16 + 8 MP

LED Flash: Yes

The OPPO F3 FCB features 16 + 8 MP dual front cameras. The 16 MP camera boasts of a 120 degree wide angle and is optimized for group selfies. The other one is an 8MP camera that can be used for the normal selfies.

In addition to that you get a 13 MP rear camera for general photography. The Oppo F3 camera packs extra features such as palm shutter and beatification.

What sucks?

Runs Android 6.0

The OPPO F3 FCB runs Android 6.0 out of the box.

This is a flaw since we have around much cheaper smartphones running Android 7.0. With Android 8.0 now available (on some phones) it’s a letdown that OPPO decided to ship the phone with an OS that will soon be outdated.

Kevin Duckett was hunting for treasure with his metal detector in a field near Market Harborough Northamptonshire England when he unearthed a solid gold figurine that experts believe is part of a long-lost part of the crown of Henry VIII.

“At first I wondered if it was a crumpled foil dish from a 1970s Mr. Kipling product or even a gold milk bottle top” Duckett told the Sun.

“I got a very loud positive signal from my detector and started to dig down before spotting something … It was lodged in the side of a hole just a few inches down.”

Duckett had found a 2½-inch solid gold and enamel figure that has been lost for over 400 years.

In 1649 Oliver Cromwell abolished the monarchy beheaded King Charles I and ordered the crown once worn by Henry VIII to be melted down minted and sold as coins — orders that weren’t followed.

According to the Sun the crown’s 344 precious stones were sold separately while other parts of the crown were passed on intact — never to be seen again.

The crown was worn by Henry VIII at his coronation and during his wedding to Anne of Cleves in 1540. The headpiece was later used at the coronations of his children Edward Mary and Elizabeth and then of James I and Charles I.

Historians think the figurine could have detached as Charles escaped or he buried it to keep it from Cromwell.

Upon finding the piece Duckett claims he knew what he had.

“I’d seen the replica on YouTube and the tiny figures on the fleurs-de-lis but I couldn’t be sure” Duckett told the paper.

“I headed to the palace to find out. … I’ll never forget the sheer excitement as I got closer to the Grand Hall where the replica sat in all its glory. I entered the room and my figurine’s identical twin was staring right at me.”

Lucy Worsley chief curator at Historic Royal Palaces told the Sun: “It’s great news that after centuries of subterranean slumber this little golden figure has been revealed once more. It is tantalizing to imagine its true history.”

The piece is now being held at the British Museum.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jb3VyaWVycHJlc3MuY29tL3N0b3J5L3Nwb3J0cy8yMDIxLzAxLzMwL21hdGVyLWRlaS13aW5zLTExLWluZGl2aWR1YWwtdGl0bGVzLXJvbGxpbmctY2VudHJhbC1zZWN0aW9uYWwtY3Jvd24vNDI2NjczNzAwMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mater Dei wins 11 individual titles in rolling to Central Sectional crown,"EVANSVILLE -- Describing how Brody Baumann and Nick Boots are related is difficult. What’s easy is simply saying the Mater Dei wrestling program is like a giant family.

Baumann a junior who decisioned Gibson Southern’s Owen Bryant 13-6 to take first place in the 160-pound division Saturday at the Central Sectional improved his record to 19-0. He was one of 11 individual champions who lifted Mater Dei to the team title with 331.5 points. North Posey placed second with 193. Mount Vernon was third with 150.5.

Baumann’s mom and Boots are cousins; Nick’s mom is his great aunt. Got it?

“My family has always been a ‘wrestling family’ and the Boots family has even been inducted into the Indiana Wrestling Hall of Fame” Baumann said. “Continuing our family tradition is a big motivator for me and one of my goals is to be the first two-time state champion from the ‘Boots lineage.’”

His grandfather Ira Boots placed fourth at state.

“He has always been in my corner supporting me” Baumann said.

Brandon Boots his uncle was a fourth- and fifth-place finisher at state.

“I can remember even as a young kid he would wrestle with me but I’m pretty sure I could take him now” Baumann said with a laugh.

Baumann has two younger brothers Camden and Grayson in seventh and fifth grade and “there’s definitely a competition to see who can win the most state titles. I hope the Baumann name becomes a staple in the wrestling community like the Boots name has.”

Mater Dei coach Greg Schaefer said Baumann is a tremendous example of what it means to be a student-athlete.

“Like many other students at our school he has a family that sets high standards for their children"" Schaefer said. “With the combination of God-given ability hard work and strong family values you are destined for success.”

As a wrestler Baumann is a relentless competitor Schaefer said.

“He has always been very technically gifted but continues to put in extra time to get better” Schaefer said. “He is starting to reap the benefits of all of the extra hours that he has put in in the weight room and on the mat.”

While Baumann won his division Nick Boots finished second at 220. A junior Boots has a 15-5 record.

“The Mater Dei wrestling team is a second family to me” Baumann said. “Everyone on the team is like a brother and we push each other to succeed as much as we push ourselves. It’s a high standard to live up to the MD tradition but that’s what makes us such a great team. We all see it as an honor to wear the MD on our chest and we know we represent every great wrestler that came before us.”

A state qualifier last year Baumann said it was difficult to watch teammates Blake Boarman and Eli Dickens win state championships from the stands.

“Both of those guys have been practice partners of mine and are a big reason I am where I am today” he said.

“Mater Dei is as deep of a program as a they come and everyone in there is wrestling a former/future state champ every day. These guys serve as a model in our room as to what you have to do if you want to be the best.""

Brandon Boots underscored that Mater Dei wrestling is all about family and tradition.

“Boots Weinzapfel Goebel just to name a few” he said. “Every kid in these families grows up dreaming of wearing the MD on their chest and having a chance to wrestle in the state finals.

“The history and tradition of MD wrestling is unmatched by any other school in the state. It’s truly special that a school the size of MD continues to accumulate state titles against the largest schools in the state. You just don’t see that in any other sport.”

Boots formerly a two-time all-state wide receiver for the Wildcats’ football team said wrestling is the most demanding high school sport in terms of grueling practices and cutting weight.

“The fact that you continue to see the same last names on the wrestling mat for MD year after year shows how much these families support the MD wrestling program” Boots said. “I couldn’t be more proud to have a nephew and a cousin on the team this year. Watching them win a team state dual meet title a few weeks ago brought back a lot of great memories of the four state titles we won when I was there.”

Schaefer said Baumann and Nick Boots who were born on the same day – Dec. 17 2003 -- have both been blessed with parents that value faith hard work and community. The February after they were born the Boots family and then-coach Mike Goebel were inducted into Indiana High School Wrestling Coaches Association Hall of Fame. In addition to Ira and Brandon Vince Boots Nick’s father Michael Boots his brother advanced to state while Tim Boots his uncle was a state champion. Josh Nick’s cousin and Tim’s son was a two-time state placer. Nathan Wright whose mom is a Boots also placed at state.

Boonville used superior depth to capture the team championship in the Castle Sectional with 246.5 points. Jordan Fulks a senior who improved to 12-2 at 160 and Cordell Heuring a senior to boosted his record to 13-1 at 285 were the Pioneers' individual champions.

There are many similarities between the hit period dramas Bridgerton and The Crown.

Both showcase the lives of English royalty the dangers of power in high society and it appears the same filming locations.

The stunning homes in both shows reflect the wealth and power of the Windsor and Bridgerton families.

Wilton House in Wiltshire has been the country seat of the Earls of Pembroke for over 400 years so is a more than appropriate setting for the royalty in both shows.

In The Crown Wilton House was transformed into Buckingham Palace and in Bridgerton it served as the Duke of Hastings' home.

The locations have been revealed as news emerged of Bridgerton breaking Netflix records with 82 million viewers tuning in all over the world.

There had been some concern that The Crown and Bridgerton could clash over using the same location but Netflix bosses told The Mirror a filing schedule had not yet been created.

A spokesperson told The Mirror: ""The Crown films in Summer 2021 and there is currently no filming schedule. There is no truth to the story that it is in competition with Bridgerton for locations.""

Wilton House has been used by many TV shows and films in the past.

Interior rooms of the mansion were used for scenes in the 2005 film adaptation of the novel Pride and Prejudice starring Keira Knightley.

Wilton House was also used in the 2018 movie Tomb Raider as Croft Manor.

India’s No. 3 batsman may not have been able to burn up the charts as he did on the previous tour – scoring 521 runs from four Tests – but that doesn’t mean Pujara did not leave an impact. All three of his half-centuries in the series came at crucial junctures the third one probably more important than the other two. India's Cheteshwar Pujara reacts as he receives treatment after he is hit while batting during play on the final day of the fourth cricket test between India and Australia at the Gabba.(AP)

Pujara scored 56 in the second innings and kept India steady. En route to the slowest half-century of his Test career Pujara endured 11 blows to the body. Yes 11 – thrice on the helmet once on the left bicep thrice on the bottom glove on his right arm and once on the chest and some more. By the time Pujara was on the flight he had plenty of bruises on his body but one that he wouldn’t mind for years to come. The batsman batted full of grit and determination but there was a specific reason why he opted to take those body blows.

""I mostly got hit from one end and that too against (Pat) Cummins. There was this crack on the pitch around the short- of-length spot from where the ball would just take off. Cummins has the skill to make the ball rear up from there and make it follow you"" Pujara was quoted as saying by The Indian Express.

""In case I took my hand up to defend it there was a risk that I would glove the ball. Considering the match situation and how we couldn’t afford to lose wickets I decided to let the ball hit my body.""

The telling blow was when one of the deliveries from Josh Hazlewood took off and caught Pujara flush on the glove on the right hand. Immediately upon impact Pujara shook his hand in pain and threw the bat down. At that moment the blow looked nasty as the physio checked on Pujara.

The camera panned to the batsman which showed a grimace on Pujara’s pain as the physio held his arm. India were hoping to not let this be another one to the injury last. Thankfully for India and Pujara the batsman was up ready to go although Pujara admits to getting hurt. But such is the threshold of the 31-year-old that it wasn’t going to keep him down for long.

""It is tough to hold the bat the grip was slightly loose. So you can’t hit the ball where you want to"" he said. ""From my early days I am not in the habit of taking pain- killers. That’s why my threshold to bear pain is pretty high. You play for so long you get used to getting hit.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbmRpYXR2bmV3cy5jb20vc3BvcnRzL2NyaWNrZXQva2FydGlrLXR5YWdpLWluZGlhLXZzLWF1c3RyYWxpYS1sZWFybmluZ3MtamFzcHJpdC1idW1yYWgtcGF0LWN1bW1pbnMtYWppbmt5YS1yYWhhbmUtNjgxNDAw0gGJAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGlhdHZuZXdzLmNvbS9hbXAvc3BvcnRzL2NyaWNrZXQva2FydGlrLXR5YWdpLWluZGlhLXZzLWF1c3RyYWxpYS1sZWFybmluZ3MtamFzcHJpdC1idW1yYWgtcGF0LWN1bW1pbnMtYWppbmt5YS1yYWhhbmUtNjgxNDAw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,No game but lots of gain: Kartik Tyagi opens up on learnings from Australia tour,"Follow us on Image Source : GETTY IMAGES Even as Tyagi remained on the bench he insisted that observing some of the best bowlers in business do their job was a ""great experience.""

Team India's young fast bowler Kaetik Tyagi was a part of the touring team which returned victorious from Australia in the four-match Test series. However Tyagi didn't make an appearance in any of the Tests and bowled in the nets throughout the entire tour.

In the post-win speech in Brisbane Ajinkya Rahane applauded Tyagi's efforts in the nets saying that he was ""fantastic."" The youngster in an interview with the Indian Express opened up on the acknowledgment from the stand-in skipper.

“The main thing was we went to Australia and we beat Australia. I was present there. When he (Rahane) mentioned my name it was a very proud moment. To be part of that team was a dream. And I hope that in the future I will also be able to bowl India to wins in matches” Tyagi said.

Even as Tyagi remained on the bench he insisted that observing some of the best bowlers in business do their job was a ""great experience.""

“How to plan for a session how to set fields how to bowl to a field. I learnt so much by watching listening and talking. I spoke to everyone I could” Tyagi said.

“Talking to (Jasprit) Bumrah watching Pat Cummins bowl or Mohammed Siraj making his debut was a great experience. (I learnt) The importance of being patient and sticking to the plan. Two of the best teams in the world are playing Test cricket you are present watching and listening and seeing so many things. I could not have asked for more. How the team discussed all the plans and then how it played out in the ground was so inspirational.""

When asked about his bowling in the nets Tyagi said that he aimed at bowling at one spot.

“I tried to bowl at one spot (in the nets). Consistently hitting a line or a length is important at the highest level. I have played in the Under-19 World Cup and the IPL. I have realised that being consistent and patient is the key in Test cricket. That makes a huge difference. You need to bowl at a spot even if wickets are not coming” Tyagi said.

Tyagi is not a part of the Indian squad for the first two Tests against England which mark the return of international cricket in India. The series will begin on February 5 with both the matches taking place in Chennai.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vc3BvcnRzY2FmZS5pbi9jcmlja2V0L2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjEvamFuLzMwL3NodWJtYW4tZ2lsbC1pcy1vbmUtb2YtdGhlLWJlc3QtdGltZXJzLW9mLXRoZS1iYWxsLWluc2lzdHMtY2hldGVzaHdhci1wdWphcmHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Shubman Gill is one of the best timers of the ball insists Cheteshwar Pujara,"Shubman Gill had played multiple fluent innings for India A and Punjab in red-ball cricket but the transition to Test cricket was so smooth that one would be left thinking of a glorious future that lies ahead of him. He was effervescent played his strokes and never let any bowler settle against him on his way to two half-centuries in three games.

More often than not he had Cheteshwar Pujara to accompany him at the other end and the contrast was clearly visible. Pujara bided time to score hard runs while Gill was a Virender Sehwag incarnate. Speaking of the contrast Pujara stated that Gill is one of the best timers of the ball who has that extra fraction of time to judge the length.

“He is one of the best timers of the ball. He has a natural ability to react to the ball a little earlier. He gets that extra fraction of time to judge the length the line and then play his shots whether it be the pull or a cover drive. He has quick hands and his downswing is so good that even when he defends the ball with that timing sometimes it goes for two or three runs. Sometimes it feels like he is playing with hard hands but he is so good at his timing” Pujara told ESPNCricinfo.

“If I speak about his batting technically it is a double-edged sword. If you remember he was out a few times against Pat Cummins earlier in the series caught at gully or slip but at the same time Gill can play the same ball for two or three. He is managing it really well. He is very talented and I hope he continues to improve because we need good openers. We have been getting good starts in the last couple of Tests matches and that is a big advantage. The way Rohit and Shubman started in Sydney and Brisbane laid a good foundation.”

There were criticisms directed at Pujara for his low strike rate and how his slow batting added pressure on other batsmen. However Pujara stated that his approach was to negate the deadly bowling at one end while letting Gill play comfortably.

“Gill's strength lies in the way he plays and that is why he is successful. If he tries to bat time or tries to defend for long periods it could pose a challenge for him. I can take the bowlers on too but if I feel I need to hang back a little I can do that as well. I can bat according to the situation. At that time I felt it wasn't wise to take the bowlers on because Gill was already doing that.

“It is important to understand what your partner is doing as a batting unit how the team is going forward. There could be occasions where both batsmen are playing their shots but most of the time if one is going well the other has to bat normally and not do anything extraordinary. That is what I was trying to do. That is my strength.

“From one end you need to make sure there is a lot of assurance a lot of stability which allows the other guy freedom to play their shots. What ended up happening in that first session was I ended up getting too many balls from the tougher end” Pujara added."

Sony Pictures Classics releases the film in theaters on Friday December 31.

Mickey Rourke’s worn-out griping in “The Wrestler” that he’s a “broken-down piece of meat” might put you somewhat in the headspace of the character that Clifton Collins Jr. plays in “Jockey.” He’s a as the title promises jockey but at the end of his tether and grappling with the bodily consequences of years of injuries sustained from falling off the horse both proverbial and literal and trying to get back up on it one more time. Director  even if it tends to veer closer toward the heartwarming in place of harder grittier truths.

More from IndieWire

Collins whose grizzled features in this film reflect a lifetime of pain and sadness plays Jackson a depleted jockey trying to throw himself back into the ring for one final championship. But that’s complicated by his withering health tendency to chain-smoke and binge-drink and concern from his longtime trainer Ruth (a predictably fabulous Molly Parker) over whether or not it’s safe to ride. But she’s acquired a star of a horse and he’s determined to win one last title on her behalf — though what and to whom he is trying to prove remains ambiguous.

Also throwing a circumstantial wrench in things is the unexpected drop-in of a rookie rider Gabriel (Moises Arias) who says he’s Jackson’s son from a long ago broken relationship. Jackson says that’s impossible but he’s also probably blearily staring down a well of splintered relationships any of which could have easily produced a child. Whether or not Gabriel is actually his kin becomes a matter of no import as the remainder of the movie focuses on untangling what their emerging bond awakens in Jackson. Clint Bentley and Greg Kwedar’s screenplay deftly and warmly charts the course of their relationship across training sessions Jackson engages in with Gabriel. He clearly sees something of himself in this young man even if he doesn’t know what it is yet.

“Jockey” has a vérité texture due to the fact that the filmmakers immersed themselves in a real racetrack in Arizona casting actual jockeys in peripheral roles. Bentley’s feature debut is confidently assembled with the world captured by cinematographer Adolpho Veloso seeming to exist entirely in that magic hour that casts ghostly rays of sunlight across the desert plain. Aaron Dessner and Bryce Dessner the brothers behind indie band The National contribute an atmospheric score that lends a sense of longing and regret to the air.

Either refreshingly or frustratingly for a redemption movie “Jockey” is light on dramatic incident. A visit by Jackson to the long-lost woman with whom he potentially could’ve fathered Gabriel adds a sprinkling of soap operatics but doesn’t feel forced. Most endearing about the film is the easy breezy bond between Jackson and Ruth that never quite tips into romantic territory but is always suggestive of that possibility. Ruth is both the architect and enabler of Jackson’s quest for absolution — and what demons exactly he’s trying to put to rest are never fully known — and Parker palpably conveys the ambivalence her character feels about propping up a man who is barely holding it together. “You gotta tell a horse when it’s time to stop” she tells him. Arias meanwhile as Gabriel exhibits a darker dimension than shown in comedies like “Nacho Libre” and “The King of Staten Island” and commits to embody his character’s constant search for a father figure.

Collins also an executive producer here gets possibly his meatiest role ever as a horse racer whose tenacity is also his Achilles’ heel. Physically Collins slips into Jackson’s pain stuck in a perpetual lurch when he’s not on the racetrack. The performance is a deeply lived one not only in terms of what appears to be the actor’s all-in plunge into what actually goes into horse-racing but also because of the sadness Jackson constantly seems to emanate. “Jockey” doesn’t map out exactly what’s in store for Jackson by the end of it all but it does show he has a path forward even when redemption remains that elusive thing ahead.

Grade: B

“Jockey” premiered in the U.S. Dramatic Competition at the 2021 Sundance Film Festival.

Lisa was getting her chemotherapy treatment at her Souderton Pa. home on Jan. 16 2021. Penn Medicine has ramped up doing some forms of chemotherapy at home instead of in the hospital or in an infusion center. Read more

As she fights cancer Lisa Oney is not shackled to a hospital bed for days at a time stuck there while she is infused with chemotherapy drugs.

She’s undergoing chemo at home — even on the move. At times the life-saving medicine is flowing into her as she drives to make curbside pickups at Target.

Thanks to a new program at Penn Medicine Oney 33 carries her chemotherapy medicine in a backpack with a small pump that feeds the drug into her body. “I’m able to walk around and take care of my kids” she said. “I can go places.”

Typically her particular regimen of chemotherapy would require several five-day stays in the hospital spread over 18 weeks. The trouble was Oney needed to be home in Souderton to care for her 3-month-old son and 3-year-old daughter.

“I couldn’t do that” she said referring to the hospital visits. “My husband wouldn’t be able to work.”

Because of COVID-19 Oney and her husband Kevin O’Driscoll also can’t accept help from friends and coworkers. The risk of her catching the coronavirus or something else is too great.

Chemotherapy at home is a rising trend driven by patient convenience and the widespread fear of hospitals during the pandemic. But as much as patients love it antiquated health-care billing systems especially in Medicare remain a formidable obstacle to the practice.

Penn’s shift of some chemotherapy treatments to home started on a small scale before the pandemic but then took off according to Justin Bekelman the radiation oncologist who directs the Penn Center for Cancer Care Innovation

Under the at-home process Penn nurses drive to patients’ residences to set up the complex lines and do the injections involved in the cancer treatment which in Oney’s case continues for days. After that the backpack-wearing patients are free to go about their lives.

Bekelman said that Penn had good reasons to launch the effort. “It’s obviously patient-centric and will enhance patients’ experience of cancer treatment” he said “but also our infusion suites were all full up.”

Most experts see the move as positive for employers and taxpayers who pay much of the cost of health care. Insurers pay less for patients who choose an at-home option as opposed to infusion at their main facility or even a specialist’s office.

Aetna a major health insurer in the Philadelphia region said last year that a single infusion of a specialty drug in a hospital even on an outpatient basis costs more than $20000. The savings from moving it to an independent outpatient center can exceed 50% it said. Home treatments save about the same experts said.

But chemo in the home means much less money for hospitals Bekelman noted making it harder to expand the treatments.

“We need a payment model that keeps health-care providers whole irrespective of where we deliver the treatment” he said. “That’s a crucial incentive for health systems to invest in providing more care at home and other less expensive locations — a shift that should ultimately save insurers money.”

A more logical payment system would promote changes such as in-home chemotherapy. And there has been some movement in that direction said Larry Levitt a health policy scholar at the Kaiser Family Foundation. One approach would be to uncouple insurance payments from specific procedures he said.

“The concept is to pay providers a flat amount for certain patients or conditions” Levitt said “and let the providers figure out the best way to deliver care keeping any savings they realize.”

He added: “The key is to build in safeguards to prevent providers from skimping on care.”

Not a new concept

Since at least the mid-1990s home health care companies have talked about providing in-home chemotherapy but little has come of it.

John Sprandio an oncologist with offices in Delaware and Chester Counties welcomes at-home chemotherapy but cautions that it is actually more costly to provide than many realize.

“In terms of efficiency” Sprandio said “it’s obviously more cost-effective to administer these drugs for the majority of patients in a group setting where you have a team of a dozen nurses and 28 or 30 treatment areas that’s equipped to handle anything.”

Meanwhile major trade associations such as the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the Community Oncology Alliance have formally opposed the practice. In statements last year they cited a fear that patients might have a bad drug reaction with no doctors nearby.

Richard Snyder chief medical officer for the parent company of Independent Blue Cross said he was convinced that the trend was safe.

“Physicians and hospitals tend to be creatures of habit” Snyder said. “We keep doing what seems to work for us and so we’re not inclined to change our habit of giving the medication in a hospital or a higher-cost setting.”

Snyder described Penn as being at the forefront of moving chemotherapy to the home where the patient is probably as safe as possible from exposure to COVID-19 and other infections.

Penn’s Cancer Care at Home program ramped up from 39 patients in March to more than 300 within a month as patients were eager to avoid hospitals. In all of last year nearly 1500 Penn patients received in-home chemo.

Currently patients with breast cancer prostate cancer and lymphoma are candidates for the program Bekelman said. Penn hopes to add patients with lung cancer head and neck cancers and others but that depends on higher reimbursements and other changes to insurance plans.

Bekelman said the goal wasn’t to transfer all cancer care but to establish that it can be done safely off premises.

He noted that there were some limits because the risk of side effects was too severe with some chemo drugs.

Other Philadelphia-area providers of cancer care are not as active. Jefferson Health’s Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center has helped only 50 or so in-home patients in recent years. Fox Chase Cancer Center said it has no plans to join the trend. Nor does MD Anderson Cancer Center at Cooper hospital in Camden.

Nationally CVS Health has joined Penn in trying to move more chemotherapy treatments to homes. This month CVS which owns Aetna announced that its infusion unit Coram would work with Cancer Treatment Centers of America to do that starting in Atlanta.

The insurance problem

Limiting wider adoption of in-home chemotherapy is a legacy payment system that provides much larger reimbursement when the treatments are done at a hospital.

Comparisons for such costs at different sites are hard to find. But a 2019 report showed that the average claim for an injection of infliximab used to treat autoimmune diseases was about $3100 in a physician’s office compared with $5800 in a hospital’s outpatient department. Bekelman said that the same pattern holds for chemotherapy drugs and that reimbursement at home is similar to in a physician’s office.

Jefferson’s Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center has received widely varying reimbursement rates for home infusion. Some plans reimburse “on par with on-site infusion while others reimburse at very low levels or not at all” Karen E. Knudsen a top oncology expert at Jefferson said in an email.

Timothy Kubal an oncologist who directs the infusion center at the Moffit Cancer Center in Tampa Fla. predicted that much more cancer care could be provided in the home within a decade “but in between now and then there’s going to be a lot of conversation about what’s the right rate.”

The patient’s perspective

The bulk of the cancer patients Penn has been treating at home — instead of at an infusion center — are receiving injections for breast and prostate cancer. Penn Home Infusion nurses work around the patients’ schedules to they don’t have to lose time at jobs Bekelman said.

Avoiding a hospital stay as Oney the patient from Souderton is doing is an even bigger deal during the pandemic.

“We have generally seen that being in the hospital can be tough no family food is different. Depression can set in so overall I think this is a good trend if patients can manage at home” said Kelly Harris CEO of the nonprofit Cancer Support Community Greater Philadelphia.

Oney was diagnosed with lymphoma in November just two weeks after her son was born. Before she began receiving steady treatment at home she was given her first round of chemo in the hospital to ensure that she didn’t have an adverse reaction.

There was none. But on one later evening Oney a neonatal nurse at Grand View Hospital in upper Bucks County got a headache as soon as the infusion started — possibly because she had forgotten to take the medication out of the refrigerator ahead of time.

Oney got a quick response from Penn’s on-call oncologist who told her to take ibuprofen. “It’s all very connected” she said.

Although being home doesn’t head off the miserable side effects of chemotherapy she considers it a blessing to avoid those overnight hospital says.

I’m thankful to be home with my kids” she said. “I couldn’t imagine not seeing them for five days every three weeks.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vdGFtcGFuZXdzZm9yY2UuY29tL3JpY2stc2NvdHQtZGlzbWlzc2VzLXBoYXJtYWN5LXNjYW1tZXJzLWFzLWFtYXRldXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"Rick Scott dismisses Tampa Bay pharmacy scammers as ""amateurs""","Five Tampa Bay men have pled guilty in what federal prosecutors are calling the biggest healthcare fraud case in history.

Court records show that Larry Everett Smith Scott Roix M.T. Maikel Bolos and Arun Kapoor submitted $931356 936 in bogus prescription bills to giant pharmacies including CVS Caremark Optum and others with help from telemarketing companies netting themselves $175 million. companies.

“Pssh” commented Florida Senator and former Governor Rick Scott. “Talk to me when you get on my level.”

The nefarious plot was based on tricking unsuspecting patients into providing their personal medical and insurance information.

“When you look at this entire scheme they’re using our healthcare industry to fraudulently get prescriptions to give prescriptions to those who don’t need them to give to pharmacies that they own and control to further their scheme in making millions and almost a billion dollars” said Tampa attorney Anthony Rickman.

“‘Almost a billion’? Ha!” scoffed Scott. “They did $900 million worth of work nickel and diming a bunch of rubes instead of going after a fat mark like Medicare directly and they came away with less than a quarter of that. Strictly amateur hour if you ask me.”

During Scott’s time in the private sector before getting into politics Scott pocketed $300 million from Medicare fraud when he was the CEO of Columbia/HCA for which the hospital company was fined $1.7 billion.

“$175 million split five ways isn’t enough to buy a decent platinum swimming pool” Scott said. “It wouldn’t be worth my time to pick up the phone to make that kind of chump change.”

“I hate to be too critical. I applaud their effort. It would do my heart good to see young men in this day and age taking some initiative if I had one” he said. “But overall I’m not impressed. Frankly if it were me I’d be embarrassed. Except I lack the capacity to feel shame or show contrition.”

Smith Roix M.T. and Maikel Bolos have pled guilty to conspiracy to commit health care fraud while Kapoor pled guilty to misbranded drugs with an intent to defraud which Scott also found disappointing. “You never ever take accountability for your own crooked actions guys! What’s the point of me setting an example if you’re not going to follow it?” he asked rhetorically. “Work smarter not harder.”

Bremo is one of three locally-owned pharmacies that have partnered with the Richmond-Henrico Health District to reach more people eligible for a vaccine under Phases 1A and 1B.

The Virginia Department of Health tasked its staff to inoculate local doctor’s offices not connected to a hospital system and group homes in Metro Richmond.

“Now it’s like everything we did in January we have to do again in February” Bremo Pharmacy President Catherine Cary said. “As we finish with the second dose we’re hoping they’ll send us more and we will be able to vaccinate more people.”

Currently Walgreens and CVS have worked with the state to vaccinate residents and staff of long-term care facilities.

Outside of that local pharmacies across the state have administered 18000 doses out of nearly 700000 total doses.

State Vaccination Coordinator Dr. Danny Avula said there were 420 privately-owned pharmacies across the state that have been approved to become vaccinators.

The only thing standing in their way is the short supply of doses.

“They are ready to serve in whatever ways needed but because we are focusing on the large-scale vaccinations especially in the population centers pharmacies have had a smaller part of the pie” Dr. Avula said during a Friday teleconference.

Moving forward pharmacies of every kind will be needed to ensure the state reaches its goal of 50000 doses administered per day.

Those facilities will be crucial for a return to normalcy especially in rural areas far from urban centers and mass vaccination clinics.

Meanwhile Dr. Cary’s staff and her clients wait for more doses.

“Our pharmacists are excited to do this and we have volunteers willing to help us with the clinics as well. We definitely could do more if there was more vaccine available” she said. ""We get heartbreaking stories every day of individuals who definitely need the vaccine and we really really want to help them -- but we just have to be a little bit more patient."""

(Progressive Farmer image provided by Willmar Fabrication)

Label changes to three dicamba herbicides could increase the use of broadcast sprayer hoods in soybeans to maximize the use of the chemistries.

Late last year the EPA approved five-year registrations for two canceled dicamba herbicides: XtendiMax and Engenia. It also reregistered Tavium a dicamba herbicide. All three weed killers can be sprayed over the top of dicamba-tolerant Xtend soybeans and cotton.

Last June a federal court terminated the original 2018 registrations for XtendiMax Engenia and FeXapan another herbicide used in dicamba-tolerant crops but not included in the recent registration decision. The court ruled the EPA didn't take into account the herbicides' risk to the environment and years of injury complaints to sensitive crops among other things.

The new label includes several changes to address off-target problems associated with in-season dicamba use. To minimize issues caused by herbicide drift the EPA increased the downwind buffer between the last treated row of a dicamba-tolerant crop and the nearest field edge from 110 feet to 240 feet and up to 310 feet in areas where endangered species are located. Other state and county restrictions may apply.

The labels also state the downwind buffer for dicamba-tolerant soybeans can be reduced possibly back to the original 110-foot separation if a qualified broadcast hooded sprayer that's proven to reduce herbicide drift is used. A buffer reduction doesn't apply to dicamba-tolerant cotton if a hooded sprayer is used.

""Hoods will provide more flexibility on how to apply the product [dicamba] where it's applied and protecting the environment"" says Greg Kruger University of Nebraska (UN)pesticide application technology and weed science specialist. ""I see this as a win-win for everyone.""

Hoods do not address dicamba volatility concerns he adds.

A wider buffer may prevent or discourage some farmers from planting Xtend crops because of small or odd-shaped fields explains Dave Rhylander a consultant with Willmar Fabrication based in Benson Minnesota. The company makes Redball-Hooded Sprayers and Sprayer Hoods.

Rhylander says a wider buffer would also limit dicamba use on acres with herbicide-resistant weeds. Open booms can be used outside of the downwind buffer area.

""Nobody is talking about this or helping people think through the impact of the [extended] buffer"" Rhylander says. ""A hood will reset the clock to what you did last year [in dicamba-tolerant soybeans] for buffers in nonendangered species areas.""

CALL IT A COMEBACK

The label change could make hoods a more common site in soybean fields. In-row hoods were widely used by Southern farmers to postdirect glyphosate to avoid crop injury after Roundup Ready cotton was introduced in 1997. The introduction of Roundup Ready Flex cotton with increased tolerance to glyphosate sidelined hoods for many farmers -- at least temporarily.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYXl0b25kYWlseW5ld3MuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9sYXRlLWpvaG4tY2hhbmV5LXJlbWVtYmVyZWQtd2VsbC1pbi1kYXl0b24tZm9yLWluLXRoZS1zdGlja3MtY29tbWVudC0xOS15ZWFycy1hZ28vQUdVV0pNV0ZIRkVCUkNWTk5ZR1QyRldTTVkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Late John Chaney endeared himself to Dayton Flyers fans 19 years ago,"The official Dayton basketball Twitter account released a statement that read “We are saddened to hear of the passing of coach Chaney. He was a fierce competitor and iconic figure in the game. Coach Chaney was always a class act and beloved by Flyer fans. We extend our deepest condolences to his family friends and former players. May he rest in peace.”

Chaney will forever be remembered in Dayton in part because of a comment he made in 2002. He offended Dayton fans and then endeared himself to them. He made the comment in January of 2002 when asked about the Atlantic 10 tournament moving from Philadelphia to Dayton in 2003.

“Why should the three of us (Temple La Salle and Saint Joseph’s) have to go to Dayton?” Chaney said. “Money talks. Dayton will draw a bigger crowd even though it’s in the sticks somewhere.”

When Temple played its first game at UD Arena after that comment later that season UD students were ready to “stick” it to Chaney. Students held a sign that read “Welcome to the Stix.” Another sign read “Howdy Coach!” Students wore John Deere hats playing up the country theme.

Greg Popham who was president of the Red Scare student section at UD Arena that year remembers Feb. 27 2002 well.

“We were blowing up balloons passing out hats and decorating above the floor hours before the game” Popham said “and Coach came up to say hello. He was so gracious: taking photos telling stories laughing. He was so entertained by the whole thing. He might have even apologized once for calling us the sticks but said it was all in good fun. He insisted on posing with us in a straw hat too. My respect for him went up another level after that.”

Dayton lost the game that day 75-70 in overtime but won the A-10 tournament a year later by beating Temple 79-72 in the final. In the postgame press conference after that loss Chaney praised Dayton coach Oliver Purnell.

“He’s really developed the program and it’s going to continue to flourish” Chaney said. “He’s got great players and they’re respectful. They make statements not just by verbalizing it. They make statements with their behavior. You’ve got a great coach. Just make sure you take care of him.”

By that point all had been forgiven for the “in the sticks” comment but it’s well remembered. Here’s the Feb. 28 2002 story Bucky Albers wrote for the Dayton Daily News about Chaney earning forgiveness.

CHANEY HAS A BLAST WITH `GREAT’ UD FANS

Temple coach chats with `protesting’ fans signs autographs

DAYTON — John Chaney got a big kick out of it.

When the Temple University basketball coach walked into the University of Dayton Arena on Wednesday night and saw the UD students wearing farmers’ clothing to mock his reference to Dayton being “in the sticks” Chaney sat down at the edge of the student section and signed autographs for more than 15 minutes.

The Red Scare a UD student booster organization purchased 120 green John Deere hats with `UD Flyers’ stitched on the back and another 100 straw hats. Each member of the group received one as they entered the arena.

Forty-five minutes before the game Red Scare members formed a line down the aisle next to section 107 and had Chaney autograph their hats. He tried on both the John Deere hat and the straw hat and had his picture taken.

The late John Chaney will always be remembered in Dayton for this story. https://t.co/VSwGNopqoF pic.twitter.com/cigUw283k5 — David Jablonski (@DavidPJablonski) January 30 2021

“Welcome to The Sticks Coach Chaney” one UD student said as he presented his hat.

“This is great” Chaney said. “This reminds me of West Virginia when I’d go there and they all had my faces (in cardboard).’

Chaney looked at one of the students and said “I always start trouble don’t I?”

“I love it when they hate me. But these people aren’t capable of hating anybody. I love ‘em. They’re great fans.”

Chaney said they don’t get John Deere hats like that in Philadelphia and someone told him that you have to live in the sticks to wear John Deere hats.

“We’ve got Sticks in Philly” Chaney countered.

Willie Morris III wore a straw hat as he played the national anthem on his saxophone and the students were singing Old McDonald Had A Farm as the Temple team was introduced.

When Chaney was announced the crowd booed and Chaney broke into a big smile.

After the introductions UD coach Oliver Purnell presented Chaney with a crystal memento to salute his induction into the College Basketball Hall of Fame. The crowd applauded Chaney who took his gift to the bench and then walked over to the student section and asked Morris if he could have his straw hat.

Chaney then walked onto the court wearing the straw hat as the crowd applauded.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZXNtb2luZXNyZWdpc3Rlci5jb20vc3RvcnkvbGlmZS9saXZpbmctd2VsbC9yYWdicmFpLzIwMjEvMDEvMzAvcmFnYnJhaS0yMDIxLW92ZXJuaWdodC1wYXNzLXRocm91Z2gtdG93bnMtbWVtb3JpZXMtc2NlaW5pYy1oaXN0b3JpYy82NjU5MDcxMDAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,RAGBRAI XLVIII overnight towns pass-through towns will make memories,"It's not the destination it's the journey it's been said.

But sometimes it is a little about the destination.

The Register's Annual Great Bicycle Ride Across Iowa is an opportunity for riders to test their endurance and commune with other bikers in an epic seven-day adventure while taking in Iowa's landscapes.

But the towns riders pass through and the ones they lay their heads down in have almost as much to offer as the riding itself.

Trying again:After coronavirus cancellation RAGBRAI climbs back in the saddle with full 2021 route

More events:Gravel day virtual ride fall ride highlight RAGBRAI calendar of events in 2021

RAGBRAI riders will make their 426-mile trek July 25-31 resuming an annual tradition paused in 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. These towns along the route officially announced Jan. 30 have natural beauty architectural history and other attractions that riders just might want to circle back for after the ride is over.

Sunday July 25 (Le Mars to Sac City)

Launch point: Le Mars is hosting the start of the ride for the second time — it also served in that role in 2005. It's not hard to get the scoop on why RAGBRAI would return: Le Mars home to the Blue Bunny ice cream plant is Iowa's unquestioned ice cream capital. What better way to start the trip than with some Rocky Road?

Overnight town: Sac City will have its debut as an overnight stop this year after serving as a pass-through town in 1975 1995 and 2012. Staying the night there will give riders the opportunity to see a rare sight: the world's largest popcorn ball assembled by volunteers in 2016.Weighing a ""popping"" 9370 pounds it's housed in its own special structure on the grounds of the Sac City Museum.

Along the route: Cleghorn may not be New York City but it has its own Central Park. Cleghorn also has an arboretum with trees planted by Marcus-Meriden-Cleghorn Middle School students staff and volunteers.

Monday July 26 (Sac City to Fort Dodge)

Overnight town: Fort Dodge has been one of the most popular towns as an overnight RAGBRAI stop. This year marks its sixth time in that role beginning with the inaugural ride in 1973. The town also has some gems to admire such as a 10-foot-tall replica of the Cardiff Giant that was at the center of an international 19th-century hoax about the discovery of a huge petrified man. And with almost 20000 square feet of water surface the Rosedale Rapids Aquatic Center could well be the most impressive municipal pool complex in Iowa.

Along the route: You'll know you're riding through Moorland which might qualify as tiny with a population of just over 200 when you pass the town church. Our Lady of Good Counsel is more than a century old financed with donations from residents and complete with stained-glass windows donated by parishioners. Another favorite place to pause is Lytton which claims to be the homemade pie capital of Iowa. And though it has just 4290 people Cherokee has its own symphony orchestra.

Tuesday July 27 (Fort Dodge to Iowa Falls)

Overnight town: In a blast from the past Iowa Falls will host for the fourth time and the first in 17 years. The town with its cliff-lined stretch of the Iowa River is one of the most scenic in Iowa with a bevy of natural beauties that includes the Calkins Nature Area and the Rock Run Creek Trail and Bridge. Don't miss the Swinging Bridge and the Timbukbrü microbrewery which opened its Iowa Falls location in 2020.

Along the route: Webster City is a literary landmark as the home of two Pulitzer Prize winners: MacKinlay Kantor who was born in Webster City won for his 1955 Civil War historical novel ""Andersonville"" and Clark Mollenhoff who as a Des Moines Register reporter won the Pulitzer for national reporting in 1958 went to high school there. In Alden you'll have a ""dam"" fine time if you catch sight of the small town's main attraction the Alden dam on the Iowa River a lure for fishermen. The town also has a veteran's memorial for the towns of Alden Buckeye and Popejoy that was funded through donations from Collins Dunning American Legion Post 201 and Alden residents. Alden with a population of just over 800 also is the smallest community in America to have received a Carnegie grant to establish a public library. The Grace O. Doane Public Library was built in 1914 with a $9000 grant from Pittsburgh steel magnate Andrew Carnegie who in the 1880s who donated $60 million to fund 1689 public libraries across the United States. The library was renovated in the late 1990s with a $250000 grant from the Dr. Grace O. Doane Foundation named in honor of the woman who established the foundation.

Wednesday July 28 (Iowa Falls to Waterloo)

Overnight town: Waterloo will teach riders a thing or two about modern farming. You can watch a tractor be assembled at the John Deere factory and visit the John Deere Tractor & Engine Museum. As the largest city on the route Waterloo also proudly stakes its claim to be the most diverse community in the state. It will host riders for the first time in 11 years and the fourth time in the ride's history.

Along the route: Ackley is home to some prime natural sites including Prairie Bridges Park a Silos and Smokestacks National Heritage Area. The park has 101 acres of woodlands and prairie and offers several camping sites and three miles of trails. You'll also pass through New Hartford population 703 the hometown of U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley R-Iowa the most senior member of that chamber.

Thursday July 29 (Waterloo to Anamosa)

Overnight town: After the longest stretch of the ride cyclists will relax in Anamosa which will celebrate its fourth overnight visit. It's a great place to admire two-wheelers of another kind as the home of the National Motorcycle Museum. Anamosa also honors the memory of Iowa arts icon Grant Wood who was born nearby with the Grant Wood Art Gallery.

Along the route: Urbana is no stranger to bikers with a 51-mile rideable nature trail running through the heart of it. The combination paved and crushed limestone Cedar Valley Nature Trail connects Linn and Waterloo counties and also is popular for skating hiking and cross-country skiing. The trail offers a mix of views along the Cedar River including woodlands wetlands and farmland.

Friday July 30 (Anamosa to DeWitt)

Overnight town: DeWitt is the second town on the route to premiere as an overnight stop. Its last time on any RAGBRAI route was in 1994 as a pass-through town. It is on the Lincoln Highway and often is referred to as the Crossroads of Opportunity because it sits at the intersection of two highways — U.S. 30 and U.S. 61.

Along the route: Lost Nation. Take a minute to think about history while you're pedaling through this small town. It got its name from a Native American story about a successful tribe where the town now sits. A Native American described the tribe to settlers as ""Boss Nation"" which became ""Lost Nation"" when the tribe departed.

Saturday July 31 (DeWitt to Clinton)

Ending point: On the last day of the ride Clinton also celebrates its sixth time as a RAGBRAI finish line where riders mark the end of the journey by dipping their tires into the mighty Mississippi. The big river is at its biggest just north of Clinton reaching a width of three miles and Clinton's blufftop Eagle Point Park with its famous stone tower is a great place to get a view.

Along the route: Be prepared for some spooky vibes heading into the last day of the ride: Charlotte is known for its haunted house. The attraction's Facebook page describes it as having ""Bloodthirsty spooks with sharp and rusty implements ready to jump out of shadows and inflict harm.""

Fendt Turn Assistant

The smart technology of the Fendt Turn Assistant manages all the steps for precise and efficient hands-free turning of a tractor and implement at the field edge. Unlike other systems it self-adjusts within the parameters set for that field and it includes a field overview map allowing the operator to see each turn. The system has two modes. Traditional U-Turn mode completes headland turns and Part Field mode completes turns in areas of the field that require a specific pattern such as skip rows during a deep tillage operation. Both modes make the operator’s job easier save time reduce fuel use and result in smoother turns causing less impact on the soil.

Airlines canceled most New York City-area flights scheduled for Monday ahead of a strong winter storm that's expected to bring high winds and heavy snow to the region. Local officials also urged people to stay off roads.

Flight schedules were already drastically lower than the norm because of the Covid-19 pandemic and a host of travel restrictions.

LaGuardia Airport midmorning said all commercial flights were suspended while public transportation to John F. Kennedy International Airport and Newark Liberty International Airport was disrupted and most afternoon flights were canceled.

More than 70% the departures scheduled from Kennedy Airport or 151 flights have been canceled as have 90% or 106 flights from LaGuardia Airport according to FlightAware a flight-tracking site. More than 70% of the departures 162 flights from United Airlines hub at Newark were also canceled. A snowstorm canceled about a quarter of departures from Chicago's O'Hare International Airport on Sunday.

American Airlines on Monday afternoon said it canceled flights for the rest of the day at LaGuardia Kennedy Newark Boston Providence and that operations will be limited at those airports on Tuesday. American said operations were scaled back at its Philadelphia hub on Monday.

Airlines stopped charging ticket change fees last year in an effort to boost bookings in the pandemic but several major carriers said they won't charge fare differences for travelers affected by the winter storm.

Delta Air Lines and American Airlines said travelers can change their tickets to and from more than two-dozen airports in the mid-Atlantic and Northeast without paying a difference in fare if they can rebook by Saturday.

New York-based JetBlue Airways said travelers won't have to pay the fare difference if they can travel by Friday while United had a similar policy if customers rebook Sunday. All the carriers encouraged customer to check with their airline for up-to-date information.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBhZGRsZXlvdXJvd25rYW5vby5jb20vMjAyMS8wMS8zMC91bml0ZWQtYW1lcmljYW4tYWlybGluZXMtcHJlcGFyZS10by1mdXJsb3VnaC10aG91c2FuZHMtb2YtZW1wbG95ZWVzLWFnYWluL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,United American Airlines Prepare to Furlough Thousands of Employees... Again,"Two of America’s largest flight attendant unions have written an open letter to President Joe Biden pleading with him to support extending a payroll support program that has kept many airline workers in paid employment throughout the pandemic. The letter was sent on the same day that United Airlines sent federal WARN notices to 14000 employees to notify them of impending furloughs when the current bailout runs out in April.

American Airlines is also preparing to send WARN notices to its own employees in the coming days although a spokesperson for the Dallas Fort Worth-based airline has denied rumors that the letter will be posted this coming Monday.

Passenger airlines received $25 billion in payroll support funding in the first CARES Act which protected jobs through the end of September 2020. At least 32000 airline workers were furloughed without pay or healthcare benefits for several months while Congress wrangled over an extension to the Coronavirus relief bill.

The extension was eventually passed on December 28 2020 and passenger airlines received a further $15 billion to keep workers in paid employment – even if there wasn’t nearly enough work to go around because of the massive slump in passenger demand caused by the pandemic.

The problem however is that the second payroll support program was only meant to support employees through to the end of March 2021. Some airlines and lawmakers had optimistically thought that the airline industry would be heading into a full-blown recovery by the Spring but surging COVID-19 infections and the fear of vaccine-resistant variants mean any recovery might not come until much later in the year.

The Association of Flight Attendants (AFA-CWA) and the Association of Professional Flight Attendants (APFA) who together represent 75000 flight attendants including at American and United Airlines warned of “devastating” consequences if the payroll support program was not extended.

The unions have asked for a further $15 billion in financial support to keep employees in paid employment through to the end of September – or at least until the funding runs out.

The hope is that by keeping employees on full pay and up to date with training that airlines can immediately respond as soon as travel demand starts to recover. In late November 2020 American Airlines warned of a shortage of flight attendants following just a small increase in passenger flights after furloughing nearly 8000 crew.

Southwest Airlines which also took advantage of the first and second payroll support programs believes that it will not need to furlough any employees through to the end of 2021 at the earliest even if a third bailout isn’t forthcoming. Delta Air Lines has been able to avoid furloughs through a combination of voluntary leaves and early-outs.

Scott Kirby United’s chief executive has been open about the fact that the Chicago-based carrier would furlough staff again at the end of March if travel demand didn’t drastically improve. For flight attendants staffers who joined the airline has far back at September 1998 are set to be furloughed.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlhbWV4cGF0Lm5sL2V4cGF0LWluZm8vZHV0Y2gtZXhwYXQtbmV3cy9rbG0tcmFua2VkLXdvcmxkcy1zaXh0aC1zYWZlc3QtYWlybGluZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,KLM ranked as the world's sixth-safest airline - Amsterdam,"The 2020 JACDEC ranking has named KLM the sixth-safest airline in the world beating the likes of EasyJet Delta Air Lines and Vueling.

Two Dutch airlines in the top 10

While KLM may be notoriously Dutch it isn’t the only Dutch-owned airline to nab a spot in the top 10. Coming in seventh place just behind KLM is Transavia an airline under the Air France-KLM group.

This marks the third year in a row that KLM has secured a spot in the top 10 coming in fourth place in 2018 and in ninth place in 2019. This is also the second year Transavia has made it into the top 10 coming in sixth place in 2019.

JACDEC's ranking is based on each airline’s accident history over the past 30 years but also evaluates the country-specific environment in which the airline operates and its specific risk factors. While the analysis does provide a ranking of the world’s 100 largest airlines it is worth noting that all airlines in the top 20 have a score above 90 percent proving that there isn’t much to differentiate them from one another.

The world’s top 10 safest airlines

Smaller slower and more profitable. These are the watchwords for Chesapeake Energy as it emerges from bankruptcy. Free of the colossal liabilities that sank it as the pandemic slashed global energy demand last year the company has also abandoned the growth-at-all-costs strategy that made it a pioneer of the shale revolution — and poster child of the sector’s debt-fuelled excess.

Chesapeake’s market value will be a fraction of the $35bn it boasted more than a decade ago back when its controversial founder the late Aubrey McClendon was America’s best-paid chief executive and his company poured money into everything from Oklahoma real estate to an NBA arena. The new Chesapeake pledges to spend less than it brings in and return the excess to shareholders.

Outside the US oil and gas industry this wouldn’t sound radical. Within the business it is a departure. The only feature that matched shale’s disruptive rise in the past 15 years — more than doubling US oil and gas production and sharply reducing dependence on foreign oil supplies — was the industry’s unmatched knack for destroying investors’ money as hundreds of billions of dollars were spent with little return. Wall Street reacted by dumping its stocks making the sector one of the S&P 500’s smallest. When the worst oil crash in decades struck last year operators were forced to slash capital expenditure sack tens of thousands of workers idle rigs and cut production. Chesapeake’s Chapter 11 filing was just the most high-profile of scores of bankruptcies.

Now promise shale executives a more resilient industry is emerging from the ashes that aims to woo investors. Like the reincarnated Chesapeake it will be smaller — some analysts believe the sector will be reduced to just 10 dominant shale producers. Production increases will be modest and financed from cash flow. And activity will focus on fewer prolific shale fields mainly in Texas. Oil operators that feared new US president Joe Biden’s ambition to launch a green energy revolution would stymie the industry’s drilling and slow production growth now promise to do both themselves.

“I do believe we have a lot of proving to do to get investors back” says Vicki Hollub head of Occidental Petroleum which 18 months ago racked up $50bn in debt buying a rival producer in a deal now considered one of the most reckless gambles in the shale patch’s short history.

Cash flow and earnings growth must be the new priorities Ms Hollub says. “I believe that the watershed moment is here and our industry will I don’t think ever be the way we have been in the past.”

Can the industry’s new pitch be trusted? Some investors remain sceptical remembering how past promises of capital discipline crumbled when oil prices rose. “Give an oilman a dollar and he’ll drill a well” runs the old industry adage. In an era when environmental concerns are already deterring investment in fossil fuels and long-term growth in oil demand is no longer assured shale executives know they cannot risk breaking more promises.

“Why should investors trust it?” asks Matt Gallagher who headed Parsley Energy a shale producer acquired by larger operator Pioneer Natural Resources last year. “They shouldn’t.”

Early warning signs

After years of growth shale’s cash-intensive business model was running on fumes even before Saudi Arabia’s price war with Russia and the coronavirus pandemic crashed the oil market last year. The sector’s defining feature is the fast decline of each shale well’s production where output can drop by 80 per cent after just a year. To offset the loss another must be drilled. Then another to offset that well’s loss.

“In a shale play if you stop running you will fly off the back of the treadmill” says Raoul LeBlanc vice-president of energy at consultancy IHS Markit and former head of strategic planning at Anadarko Petroleum the company bought by Occidental in 2019. “Just to stay still you’ve got to do a lot of drilling.”

Operators drilled more than 14000 shale wells in 2019 according to Rystad an energy research company. It helped the US hit record-high oil output near 13m barrels a day a level unmatched even by Saudi Arabia and Russia the world’s next biggest producers.

That was a rise from 5m b/d just eight years earlier — a surge that sparked booms from Texas to North Dakota and helped drag the US economy out of the mire of the global financial crisis adding one percentage point to GDP between 2010 and 2015 according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. But it required huge infusions of cash offered at basement interest rates. Rystad says the sector spent around $400bn capital in those years but by 2019 free cash flow arrived only once in 2016.

“The fundamental problem with the shale model over the past decade has been the pursuit of growth over return on capital employed or returning capital to shareholders” says Ben Dell managing partner at Kimmeridge a private equity firm that has built up an activist position in the sector.

Investors that rushed to finance shale’s recovery from the 2014-15 price crash — an earlier Saudi price war to capture market share — were fleeing by 2019. As capital markets began to close for shale companies operators were forced to trim spending plans reducing new drilling activity. With profits still absent and growth prospects diminishing the shale patch entered 2020 in distress.

A reputation for flagrant corporate misgovernance and excess — from colossal executive bonuses earned by hitting oil output growth targets not profits to flashy office developments and rumours of company-funded hunting trips — didn’t help.

Then came last year’s price crash including the symbolic moment in April when West Texas Intermediate the country’s benchmark crude contract traded below zero for the first time. “Covid hits oil prices collapse everyone has to cut their capex valuations crash” says Aaron DeCoste an equity analyst at Boston Partners an institutional investor. “And it’s effectively reset the entire industry.”

Just a few shale companies showed they could survive the collapse last year in relative health says Mr Gallagher. From Chesapeake to scores of smaller producers the distress was acute with more than 100 operators and service providers with $102bn in debt going under according to a Rystad analysis from law firm Haynes and Boone.

“The ones that went wrong went way wrong” Mr Gallagher says. “What’s going on now is people are finding religion about the models that work.”

M&A rush

One tenet of the new shale “religion” is that scale is critical to survival — but of operators not the overall sector. The mergers and acquisitions to achieve adequate size coupled with the consolidation of weakened companies will continue to shrink the number of producers.

Lee Maginniss managing director at Alvarez & Marsal an advisory firm involved in oil industry restructuring says subscale producers will face “intense” pressure. From around 500 exploration and production companies in the US before the crash 50 may survive he says. Other analysts say just 10 or so dominant public shale companies will be left to run the best plays.

M&A activity is brisk with $52bn worth of deals done in the US oil sector last year according to Enverus a data provider. Chevron moved first buying Noble Energy in July. ConocoPhillips bought Concho Resources. Devon Energy merged with WPX Energy. Heavy debt battered balance sheets and weak equity valuations meant that stocks not cash were the currency in each deal.

Pierre Breber Chevron’s chief financial officer expects the consolidation wave to continue. “You need to have bigger players stronger players more disciplined management teams stronger balances sheets” he says. Scott Sheffield Pioneer’s chief executive says only companies with market capitalisation above $10bn will remain attractive to a value-focused investor base.

Scale will also allow them to compete with ExxonMobil and Chevron US majors which have built up commanding shale positions. Between them they intend to produce about 2m b/d from the Permian Basin later this decade — almost a fifth of total current US crude production.

Most of the M&A activity has occurred in that shale oilfield the world’s most prolific where operators will concentrate on the rich layers of oil-bearing rocks in the Delaware and Midland Basins of New Mexico and Texas. Gas-focused players such as the revamped Chesapeake are likely to stick to their best assets. Other shale fields even the Bakken of North Dakota that sparked the shale oil rush a decade ago will lose out.

“The heydays of the Bakken [Texas’s] Eagle Ford [Nebraska’s] Niobrara the Scoop Stack play in Oklahoma are all over” says Mr Sheffield referring to other shale fields in the US.

Capping output

But the main feature of the post-crash shale patch will be an era of tepid growth — if it expands at all. Rick Muncrief chief executive of Devon says his company can now break even at $30 a barrel or less well below the $50-plus for oil in recent weeks. Yet Devon will hold its rig count flat this year only drilling a few wells to meet the lease terms of some acreage.

“From publicly traded companies you’ll see a very measured response” says Mr Muncrief. US oil production is likely to fall by 200000-300000 b/d as a result he believes remaining around 11m b/d — well below the record highs set before last year’s crash.

“Are people going to return to growth? Is US shale going to grow? The answer is no” says Mr Sheffield. “Don’t anticipate a big ramp up in drilling people are not going to go back to the old ways.”

Even if oil prices hit $100 Mr Sheffield says his company would only increase output by 5 per cent a year — less than half the rate of average annual growth in total shale production between 2008 and the beginning of last year.

Analysts say this will be enforced by the market which has punished excessive supply growth — even before the pandemic hit last year — reducing oil and gas’s share of the S&P 500 almost to a footnote.

“The reason why energy is down to 2 per cent of the S&P 500 is because of that behaviour” says Mr Breber. Until the world has fully recovered it will not need shale producers to increase oil supply he says.

So far operators are holding the line. Rystad says third-quarter capital spending by the 39 main shale operators it covers was $3.6bn beneath cash flows from operations allowing a record 89 per cent of operators to balance their budgets. If the discipline sticks dividend- and value-focused investors could be lured back.

“I see attractive fundamentals that I haven’t seen for 20 years” says Mr DeCoste referring to the cheap valuations of some operators juxtaposed with expectations for higher oil prices. But he is cautious about the new capital discipline pledges: “It takes years to build your reputation and moments to destroy it.”

Prisoner’s dilemma

Despite the wave of consolidation other analysts and investors remain unconvinced by shale’s new mantra and more mature outlook saying operators will be unable to resist another supply surge if the recent price rally continues. “Gordon Gekko once said ‘greed is good’” says one adviser to shale operators. “In the oil patch that means ‘growth is good’.”

Chief executives are just “giving the audience what it wants to hear” says Art Berman a consultant and shale sceptic. Forgoing growth is “absolutely antithetical to the DNA of oil companies in general but shale companies in particular”.

Investors will be hesitant to take operators’ pledges on faith alone says Ms Hollub. “It’s going to be a ‘show me’ situation with them.”

Higher prices in recent weeks are already testing operators’ resolve. The weekly horizontal rig count hit 338 in mid-January more than 60 per cent above its low in August. Private operators which account for about 15 per cent of onshore US oil production have led the resurgence taking advantage of falling costs caused by the drop in demand for oilfield services from publicly listed companies.

“We can drill cheaper” says Wil VanLoh head of Quantum Energy Partners a large private equity shale investor referring to his portfolio companies. “By definition private capital is growth capital . . . we out-drill our cash flow until the time we get to positive free cash flow.”

It is the kind of message that public company bosses insisting they will not be drawn into another competitive drilling binge do not want to hear — especially as some analysts project more oil price increases. Goldman Sachs predicts Brent the international benchmark will rise to $65 a barrel by mid-year.

Rystad’s head of shale research Artem Abramov says he expects 2021 to “become the best year for the industry from the perspective of free cash flow generation”. It may even allow for profitability — and new production growth testing operators’ promises to investors.

At an average WTI price of just $52 a barrel this year — around the current price — the shale operators Rystad covers would rake in almost $41bn from operations. After capex commitments debt payments and more than $4bn returned to shareholders they would still have $8bn of net cash in hand. The question is what they do with it.

“I think they lose discipline and they probably bring on too much growth and damage the market again — like they did every year in the past” says Mr LeBlanc. “They’re in a prisoner’s dilemma. They never have discipline as a group because they’re all competing with each other.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Usually fans can overlook them. Financial plot holes in specific are exceedingly common but Gilmore Girls fans can’t let go of one glaring financial plot hole in the show’s seven-season run. How did Lorelai Gilmore open the Dragonfly Inn if she used her investment money from Richard Gilmore to pay for Rory’s Chilton tuition?

Lorelai Gilmore used the money from her father’s investment to buy the Dragonfly Inn

In Season 3 Lorelai and Sookie St. James decide to open an inn together. The best friends had been dreaming of the possibility for years and finally had the perfect property picked out. The well-time maturation of an investment made for Lorelai by Richard helped the plan along. Before putting in an offer on the property Richard presented Lorelai with a check for $75000 which she intended to use on the inn.

Later it was suggested that she did in fact use the money to purchase the property. There is a big problem with the storyline though. Lorelai had seemingly already used that money for a different cause. Did she have multiple checks for $75000 or did the writers forget that she already used the cash to start a fight with Emily Gilmore?

Earlier Lorelai supposedly used that money to pay Richard and Emily back for Rory’s Chilton tuition

Rory’s decision to go to Richard and Emily for help with Yale was made behind Lorelai’s back but she had a good reason. Rory didn’t want Lorelai to spend the money from her investment on Yale instead of the Dragonfly. With financing for Yale secured Rory told Lorelai she could use the money to purchase the inn with Sookie.

Reddit users see one big problem though. Lorelai shouldn’t have had much money left to invest in the Inn or to pay for Yale for that matter. When she was speaking to the Bursar’s office at Yale she noted that she no longer had the $75000 that prevented Rory from getting financial aid. She insisted she had already used the money. So which was it? Did she earmark the funds for her business venture or did she use the money to pay back Richard and Emily? It seems like a plot hole that was never fully explained.

How much would Chilton have cost?

So if Lorelai used Richard’s investment money to pay the couple back for Chilton she likely wouldn’t have had enough money to buy the Dragonfly Inn. Some fans argue that she would have had money left over from the investment even after paying for Chilton which could have served as her down payment for the inn. Still it hardly seems like the money would be enough to repay Richard and Emily and buy a property.

Rory started prep school as a sophomore in 2000 and graduated in 2003. That means Richard and Emily would have needed to foot the bill for three full years of school. Chilton wasn’t just an imaginary school though. The elite prep school was based on Choate Rosemary Hall. Since Chilton was based on a real school we can assume the tuition was about the same.

According to Niche the Wallingford CT school charges $45000 a year for non-boarding students for the current school year. Even 20 years ago the tuition likely ran upwards of $20000 per year. If Chilton cost $20000 per year Lorelai would have owed Richard and Emily $60000 by the time Rory graduated. If that was the case she would have had $15000 left from her investment check after paying Richard and Emily. That hardly seems like enough to buy a property like the Dragonfly no matter how dilapidated it was.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldmlld2pvdXJuYWwuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL3BlcnNvbmFsLWZpbmFuY2UvZmlsZS15b3VyLXRheC1yZXR1cm4tZWFybHktdG8tZ2V0LXlvdXItcmVmdW5kLWZhc3Rlci0yMjY5ODI5L9IBeWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldmlld2pvdXJuYWwuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL3BlcnNvbmFsLWZpbmFuY2UvZmlsZS15b3VyLXRheC1yZXR1cm4tZWFybHktdG8tZ2V0LXlvdXItcmVmdW5kLWZhc3Rlci0yMjY5ODI5L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,File your tax return early to get your refund faster,"Discover how to make sure your tax return is at the front of the line when the IRS opens its doors so that you can put your refund to work for you sooner.

The deadline for filing your federal income tax return is April 15. But if you’re among the more than 70% of taxpayers expected to receive refunds from the IRS you might want to file your tax return well before the deadline so that you can get your refund as soon as possible.

The earliest that the IRS accepts returns tend to fall somewhere in mid-to-late January regardless of whether you file your taxes with a paper copy or online software. The IRS typically announces this date in early January. However your tax preparer or software provider might allow you to use its tax preparation services to complete your return prior to the tax season’s earliest date. Although that won’t get your return filed any earlier with the IRS it will ensure that your return is complete and ready to send on the start date.

Discover how to make sure your tax return is at the front of the line when the IRS opens its doors so that you can put your refund to work for you sooner.

In general the main rule is to file your taxes as soon as possible in order to get an early tax refund. Here are other steps you can take to ensure you’re getting your tax refund as soon as possible:

1. Maintain records and documentation

Keep records of activities throughout the year so that when it’s time to file your taxes all your necessary documentation is in one place. The receipts you should keep for tax purposes include records of charitable contributions business expenses and mileage costs. For example if you make periodic contributions to various charities it’s much easier to total them as you go throughout the year instead of digging through your bank or credit card statements and hoping you catch them all at the end of the year.

See: These are the receipts to keep for doing your taxes

2. Gather information for your dependents

If you claim anyone as a dependent you’ll need their Social Security number or Individual Taxpayer Identification Number. You can’t claim the dependents or qualify for the child tax credit without these numbers. And if you don’t get them by the due date for filing your return — including extensions — you’ll miss out on any refund you were entitled to.

3. Receive your official tax statements

Before you submit your tax return you’ll need to receive official tax statements such as Form W-2 and Form 1099 from employers banks and investment companies. Your employer has until Jan. 31 to file the W-2s according to the IRS. However if you don’t receive your W-2 by the end of February contact the IRS for assistance in getting the form from your employer.

If you file before you receive your form your refund could be delayed while the information is verified.

Lost W-2? Here’s what to do

4. Use the correct tax forms

To help ensure that you get your tax refund quickly select the correct tax form for your financial circumstances. Anyone who is filing an annual income tax return will use Form 1040 — the IRS has eliminated Forms 1040A and 1040EZ. You might need to fill out individual tax schedules in addition to Form 1040 if any of the following applies to you:

You have additional income such as capital gains unemployment compensation prize or award money gambling winnings or any deductions to claim such as the student loan interest deduction self-employment tax or educator expenses (Schedule 1)

You owe alternative minimum tax or need to make an excess advance premium tax credit repayment (Schedule 2)

You can claim a nonrefundable credit other than the child tax credit or the credit for other dependents such as the foreign tax credit education credits or general business credit (Schedule 3)

You owe other taxes such as self-employment taxes household employment taxes or additional taxes on IRAs or other qualified retirement plans and tax-favored accounts (Schedule 4)

You can claim a refundable credit other than the earned income credit American opportunity credit or additional child tax credit or you have other payments such as an amount paid with a request for an extension to file or excess Social Security tax withheld (Schedule 5)

You have a foreign address or a third-party designee other than your paid preparer (Schedule 6)

5. Request direct deposit

You can request to have your refund directly deposited into your bank account after you file your tax return. About 80% of taxpayers select this option rather than receive a paper check according to the IRS. In addition to receiving your refund sooner you’ll save money on the government’s behalf: It costs about $1 to process a paper check but only 10 cents to process a direct deposit.

6. Track your return and refund status with the IRS

You can track your tax return and the status of your refund by using the “Where’s My Refund?” tool from the IRS.

The tool will provide the most current information regarding the status of your return and the estimated date that you can expect your refund. It generally takes 24 hours after you submit your return electronically — or four weeks after submitting a paper return — for your information to enter the database.

A word of caution: If you claim certain tax credits including the earned income tax credit and the additional child tax credit your tax refund could be delayed. Refunds for returns that include claims for those credits can’t be issued until mid-February with most refunds not reaching taxpayers until the end of February at the earliest.

When the victims went to the counter Carlson pointed what was believed to be a firearm wrapped in a black bag at the two of them and demanded money from the cash register a sheriff’s office report states.

After a brief discussion Carlson took a bag of cash and fled in a maroon four-door vehicle. The victims were able to obtain a partial license plate number and they provided it to the detectives.

Deputies searched the area and located the vehicle approximately 20 minutes later at 16900 E. Fort King Street. Carlson was taken into custody and both victims identified her as the woman who held them at gunpoint.

Detectives obtained permission to search the residence on E. Fort King Street and the vehicle Carlson was driving. They were able to locate the clothing the victims said Carlson was wearing and $140 in the driver’s seat of the vehicle.

When Carlson was interviewed about the incident she confessed to the robbery and said that she wrapped her hand in a headrest cover to give the appearance that she was armed. She also said she committed the crime because she has an addiction to crack cocaine and wanted the money to help pay bills a sheriff’s office report states.

Carlson was placed under arrest and transported to the Marion County Jail where she was charged with robbery with a firearm and a probation violation for possession of marijuana. She was being held on $50000 bond on the new charge and no bond on the probation violation. Her next court date hasn’t yet been set jail records show.

Carlson also was arrested in August 2020 after she was caught with marijuana while riding in a vehicle that was stopped by a Marion County sheriff’s deputy.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndrZHpyYWRpby5jb20vMjAyMS8wMS8zMC9wb2xpY2UtaW52ZXN0aWdhdGUtYXJtZWQtcm9iYmVyeS1pbi1ob3BraW5zdmlsbGUvbmV3cy1lZGdlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Police Investigate Armed Robbery In Hopkinsville,"Police have released a photo of a man that reportedly robbed the Dollar General on East 9th Street Saturday afternoon.

Not too long ago states like Wisconsin Michigan and Pennsylvania were considered Democratic strongholds and not swing states. And the strength that Democrats enjoyed in those states didn't just come from deep-blue urban areas either — Democratic politicians and policies were roundly popular with rural voters across the Midwest.

That rock-steady rural voting bloc which stood strong for most of the 20th century was a direct result of President Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal which delivered electricity infrastructure transportation and economic support to out-of-the-way rural areas. Because FDR promoted policies that delivered direct life-improving results to voters those voters and their families remained loyal for generations.

Pulling away from the Democratic party

It was only after decades of inattention from Democratic leaders and a full-court campaign by Republican politicians promoting the lie that trickle-down economics would solve rampant job losses and business closures that rural Wisconsin began to drift from the party.

In December of 2020 Bill Hogseth a political organizer from rural Wisconsin wrote an incisive essay for Politico Magazine about how Donald Trump's Republican Party won over rural Wisconsin. In it Hogseth accused the Democratic Party of not offering ""rural voters a clear vision that speaks to their lived experiences.""

Still Hogseth wrote the opportunity for Democrats to gain ground was there. Rural areas are ailing: ""Small-business growth has slowed in rural communities since the Great Recession and it has only worsened with COVID-19"" Hogseth wrote adding that as ""capital overwhelmingly flows to metro areas the small-town economy increasingly is dominated by large corporations: low-wage retailers like Dollar General or agribusiness firms that have no connection to the community.""

In this week's episode of ""Pitchfork Economics"" Civic Ventures president and Wisconsin native Zach Silk interviews Hogseth about the progressive economic policies that could help Democrats gain ground in the rural areas their forebears abandoned. It's a substantive conversation that transcends the usual calls for just dumping money blindly into America's heartland.

Allowing small businesses to thrive

Hogseth makes the great point that FDR's economic policy wasn't just about building infrastructure and handing out money to rural voters.

""The most important thing"" FDR did Hogseth explains is he ""fought concentration — the robber barons the previous generation of concentrated trust power."" This progressive push against monopolies and unchecked corporate power allowed family farms and small businesses to thrive throughout America's rural areas.

Less than a hundred years later here we are again: Rural areas in America are wastelands of small business with Walmarts and Dollar General stores wiping out all the competition in retail and gigantic agricultural corporations swallowing up family farms and replacing them with exploitative low-paying jobs and cruel and environmentally unsound farming practices.

Even though Joe Biden ran arguably the most progressive economic presidential campaign in three decades Hogseth says his conversations with voters on Biden's behalf in his rural Wisconsin community were still challenging.

""It was hard for us to point to something that was going to change their life in a measurable visible tangible way that was connected to their experience as a rural American"" Hogseth said.

""There's this overwhelming feeling amongst my neighbors that a lot of the decisions that affect their life are made somewhere else"" Hogseth said. ""Culture happens somewhere else capital flows somewhere else decisions are made somewhere else.""

For organizers like Hogseth in areas that Democrats have all but abandoned ""if you don't have some transformative vision or some big audacious plan for how you're going to change people's lives that you can point to when you're doing that work it makes the organizing really really difficult"" he said.

The challenge of reaching rural communities

Despite what the snobbiest urban progressive in your Facebook feed may claim the problem isn't that rural voters are idiots who have been brainwashed.

""The folks who I talked to around here — especially farmers for example — they really understand the way the economic system works"" Hogseth said.

And those farmers ""really understand how economic power works how the companies that they buy their fertilizer and seed from have pretty much monopolized that sector. Or they can't get the best price for their grain because there's only one or two buyers in the area"" Hogseth said.

It's not that they don't understand the monopolies are sucking the life out of their land and their livelihoods — it's that they understand exactly how powerful the corporate monopolies are and they don't believe Democrats will fight them on their behalf.

""There's significant economic power surrounding them and surrounding the communities that they live in"" Hogseth said. If Democrats aren't willing to take the risk and dismantle the unfair monopolies the farmers reason there's no point in voting for them.

Hogseth can attest that winning the heartland back isn't a matter of Democratic candidates finding the right words to say or the right stock footage of amber waves of grain to edit into their campaign commercials. And no matter what the Sunday morning news shows might claim it's not about identity politics or cancel culture or any of the other buzzwords that conservative pundits are trying to sell these days.

Rural voters care about action and taking a stand and living up to your words. Unless Democrats are willing to demonstrate that they're fighting for small businesses and independent farms and against job-killing market consolidation and corporate monopolies they'll never win back the rural areas that used to be steadfast Democratic strongholds.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vNDExbWFuaWEuY29tL3dyZXN0bGluZy9kb2xwaC16aWdnbGVyLXJlc3BvbmRzLXRvLWZhbi13aG8tc2F5cy1oZS1zaG91bGQtYmUtaGFwcHktaGUtd2FzbnQtaW4tM21iL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dolph Ziggler Responds To Fan Who Says He Should Be Happy He Wasn't In 3MB,"A fan on Twitter responded to a post from Dolph Ziggler in which he disagreed with the take that he should be WWE Champion over Drew McIntyre because he has the most televised losses in WWE history.

A new assassin has thrown her wig into the arena and her name is LaLa Ri. On last night’s episode of Drag Race Atlanta queen LaLa Ri found herself in the bottom two opposite self-declared “filler queen” Joey Jay. The queens had to create looks made entirely out of bags for a “Bag Ball” challenge and after Utica tried to help LaLa thread a bobbin to no avail she ended up just hot glueing some flimsy paper gift bags to a body suit and calling it an outfit. It’s a travesty of a DIY look one that Vulture recapper Paul McCallion called “the worst look in Drag Race herstory.” It looks like a cleanup situation in the party favor aisle at Dollar Tree. But like a phoenix rises from the ashes so too does LaLa Ri ascend from runway lows to entertainment heights in a Lip Sync for Your Life to “Fancy” by Iggy Azalea.

From the opening sounds of the track LaLa is one with the music knowing when to point when to strut when to dance. She snatches her wig off a move long seen as overdone and eventually verboten in Drag Race lip-syncs made anew through LaLa’s entertaining performance turning the pink mohawk into a clutch. Her expressions are entrancing humorous and fierce elevating the source material by leagues (again this is Iggy Azalea we’re talking about). It’s impossible to take your eyes off her and every cutaway to see what Joey Jay is doing feels like we’re being robbed of precious seconds of a perfect performance. Ru is smiling and laughing. Michelle Visage is cackling. Guest judge Nicole Byer looks giddy. And punctuating it all are the queens getting their life in the background; you can hear Kandy Muse yell “YES BITCH!” as the second chorus begins.

The master stroke comes at the first chorus when Joey Jay pulls a preplanned stunt of throwing fake money in the air as she descends into splits. LaLa snatches them up from the stage as though she were being showered with tips at a gig stuffing them into her bodice. Like something out of Sun Tzu or at the very least a particularly good episode of Beyblades she used her enemy’s ace in the sleeve to destroy her. The judges ate it up and you will too.

(Sean D. Elliot/The Day) Buy Photo Reprints

The highly radioactive nuclear waste being stored at Millstone Power Station in Waterford as well as the nuclear material left behind in Haddam after the Connecticut Yankee plant was dismantled isn’t going anywhere anytime soon. Maybe never. And that’s not acceptable.

The lack of concern about the nuclear waste storage problem was one of my takeaways from the editorial board’s meeting last week with leaders from Millstone-owner Dominion Energy held virtually of course.

Chief Nuclear Officer Dan Stoddard seemed too comfortable with the status quo which has altered Millstone from a nuclear station to a nuclear station and nuclear waste storage facility.

I would have felt more comfortable if Stoddard expressed some level of anger over the failure of the federal government to meet its obligation to remove the material and place it in safe storage for the thousands of years it will continue to emit dangerous levels of radiation.

But instead of voicing any urgency to get the stuff out of there Stoddard offered assurances that the metal canisters encased in concrete that secure the spent nuclear fuel rods and block the radiation “will be secure for decades and certainly longer.”

Only when I reminded him that leaving the material there for decades was not the deal Waterford and Connecticut agreed to when the plants were licensed did he say he was “sure” that “eventually” the federal government would meet its obligation and remove the nuclear waste.

I don’t know why he is so sure.

The deal when nuclear reactors were built across the country was that the fuel rods when their energy was spent would be temporarily stored in storage pools within the plants. In time they would be placed in canisters and transferred to Yucca Mountain in Nevada on which the Department of Energy has spent $7.5 billion collected from electric ratepayers to build a safe depository deep within the mountain.

Highly radioactive waste and spent fuel from the production of nuclear weapons is stored there but it has never opened for nuclear energy-produced waste as intended. Not moving forward with Yucca Mountain is one of the few things Presidents Obama and Trump have in common. All indications are President Biden will join them.

President Obama in seeking to stay in the good graces of then Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada stalled the plans.

President Trump initially sought to restart the licensing procedure but reversed course early in 2020 which happened to be an election year with an outcome projected to be so close that Nevada’s six electoral votes could make a difference.

Still Trump lost Nevada.

An alternative idea has surfaced of moving waste to a couple of other sites rural locations in Texas and New Mexico have been discussed before a consensus can be reached on what do with it.

But I see no urgency anywhere to tackle the challenge. No one wants to deal with the outcry that would result as this stuff is moved across the country from nearly a hundred locations even if the science shows it can be done safely.

And as Stoddard told us the situation is causing no fiscal pain for Dominion and other nuclear energy companies. The U.S. Department of Energy was required by a law passed by Congress to begin removing and permanently disposing of the spent fuel in 1998. When that didn’t happen energy companies sued and won. As a result DOE is obligated to cover all the costs of storing the nuclear waste on site.

There are 31 storage containers at Millstone each with 32 spent nuclear fuel assemblies. Dominion has built a concrete pad large enough for 135 canisters. On a pad in Haddam along the Connecticut River 43 steel-reinforced concrete casks hold all the fuel from the 28 years Connecticut Yankee operated.

These containers are monitored and secured and extremely robust in their design. They are safe for now. But their contents will continue to emit dangerous levels of radiation for hundreds and thousands of years. Who knows what dystopian future might await humankind. Who could possibly assure over that expanse of time that tons of nuclear waste located along Long Island Sound and a major river that flows through all of New England will remain safely contained.

No one can.

Which is why the stuff should be entombed deep in a geologically stable depository as planned. Follow the science.

The Preserves which total 1204 acres are owned by The Nature Conservancy in West Virginia and became the 600th NNL designation by Secretary of the Interior David Bernhardt this month.

The NNL Program recognizes and encourages the conservation of sites that contain outstanding biological and geological resources. Sites are designated by the Secretary of the Interior for their condition illustrative character rarity diversity and value to science and education. Additional criteria states that potential sites for NNL designation must be one of the best examples of a type of biological community or geological feature in its biophysiographic province.

The National Park Service administers the program and works cooperatively with landowners managers and partners to promote conservation and appreciation of our nation’s natural heritage.

The Bear Rocks and Allegheny Front Preserve was evaluated by scientists familiar with the site’s resources peer reviewed by three additional scientists considered by the NNL Committee and underwent a 60-day public commenting period. This evaluation found that this site was determined to be the best example of how tectonic activity and continental collision form regionally important mountain and plateau landscapes. The National Park Service concluded that Bear Rocks and the Allegheny Front Preserves meet the criteria for national significance.

“The designation of these Preserves brings a national spotlight and significance to a place West Virginians have known to be special for decades” states Mike Powell director of lands for The Nature Conservancy in West Virginia. “Conservation efforts by The Nature Conservancy go back to the 1970s on the Dolly Sods Plateau which is now recognized as one of the premier hiking and backpacking destinations in the eastern United States.”

Globally rare plant communities and animal species call this high plateau home which is characterized by beautiful and rich habitat of spruce and northern hardwood forests grass and shrub barrens sandstone boulder fields and fens and bogs. These lands are a critical focal landscape as the Dolly Sods Plateau is part of a resilient and connected network of lands that feature climate-resilient forests and serve as a migratory highway for animal species adapting to a changing climate.

“Dolly Sods is a place of renowned natural beauty” states Congressman David McKinley. “The National Natural Landmark designation shines a national spotlight on the beauty of The Nature Conservancy’s Bear Rocks and the Allegheny Front Preserves bringing attention to these lands and waters that are so important to West Virginia’s growing tourism and outdoor recreation economy.”

Bear Rocks Preserve was acquired by donation from Dominion Energy in 2000. The Nature Conservancy acquired the Allegheny Front Preserve in April 2018 with funding from the Outdoor Heritage Conservation Fund and private donors. Additional TNC-owned lands with NNL designation include Ice Mountain Preserve and Cranesville Swamp Preserve.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vbWFyaXRpbWUtZXhlY3V0aXZlLmNvbS9tYWdhemluZS9pbnRlcnZpZXctY2hhcmxlcy1hLWRvbmFkaW8tanItcHJlc2lkZW50LWFtZXJpY2FuLXdpbmQtdHJhbnNmZXJz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Interview: Charles A. Donadio Jr. President Atlantic Wind Transfers,"(Article originally published in Nov/Dec 2020 edition.)

“I’ve pretty much spent most of my life on the ocean. When I was twelve years old I found a surfboard in a garage of a house my family was renting and walked two blocks down the street and jumped into the ocean and never looked back. I went to Narragansett High School and then on to the University of Rhode Island where I graduated with a major in Political Science.

“In college I was always looking for ways to work to earn extra money. During the summer of 1994 I found myself selling tickets for a DJ cruise on a boat. After a few of these cruises I began marketing the evening formal cruises to the fraternities and sororities on campus. The following year I purchased the vessel the Southland a flat-bottom riverboat.

“After a major restoration I relaunched the Southland in July of 1995. The narrated sightseeing tours and evening cruises sailing around Point Judith Pond and the Galilee Harbor of Refuge were an instant hit earning “Best Scenic Water Ride” in Rhode Island and an Excellence Award for Tourism Development. The business experience was invaluable learning first-hand how to own and operate a business right out of college. That experience earned me the 1998 Rhode Island Young Entrepreneur of the Year Award and then the 1998 New England Young Entrepreneur of the Year Award.

“The Southland shared the state pier with the Block Island Ferry so during the summer I would see the ferry boats departing the dock and leaving passengers behind because they were so busy. I began researching the ferry business and came across high-speed ferries that were becoming more popular in the late 1990s and realized that this type of service would cut travel time in half. In 1998 I founded Island High Speed Ferry and launched the first high-speed ferry in Rhode Island operating from Point Judith/Galilee to Block Island.

Operating this new fast ferry service got me looking at other seasonal destinations that could benefit from the fast ferry model and I ultimately settled on the island of Martha’s Vineyard which saw ten times the number of summer visitors as Block Island.

“In 2003 I founded Rhode Island Fast Ferry with the 400-passenger Millennium and launched the first high-speed ferry to Martha’s Vineyard operating from Quonset Point Rhode Island to Oak Bluffs Martha’s Vineyard and providing a two-to-three-hour drive-time savings each way for vacationers coming from New Jersey New York and Connecticut. In 2012 I built a custom new catamaran fast ferry Ava Pearl to take over the Martha’s Vineyard run while putting the Millennium into various charters.

“I was then approached by a person involved in Cape Wind about supplying crew transfer services. At the time I didn’t know what they were actually looking for so I began my research overseas to learn about this industry that didn’t exist in the U.S. I was instantly intrigued and began pursuing the Cape Wind project which ultimately did not come to fruition after all the legal proceedings kept it from progressing.

“There was also a little-known project in Rhode Island owned by Deepwater Wind moving slowly through the regulatory process. I picked up the phone and called the CEO and introduced myself and said ‘I want to build and operate the crew transfer vessel for the Block Island Wind Farm.’ He said they were several years out from looking for a vessel so check back in a year or two. I kept calling and eventually was asked if I could provide a used vessel that could be retrofitted to save on costs. I said I was taking all the lessons learned overseas with crew transfer vessels (CTVs} and applying them to a purpose-built new vessel which would do the job reliably and safely. I ultimately presented a new Southboats-designed CTV that had a proven record in Europe and won their business.

“In April 2016 the Atlantic Pioneer was launched as the first Jones Act-compliant CTV in the U.S. It went right into service supporting the construction of the Block Island Wind Farm and working with Deepwater Wind GE Fred. Olsen Windcarrier and numerous subcontractors. The Atlantic Pioneer is now approaching its fifth year supporting O&M operations for GE and Ørsted which purchased Deepwater Wind in 2018.”

Wow that’s quite a story! We asked you to grace the cover of this edition because you’re a pioneer in the fledgling U.S. offshore wind industry. Do you think of yourself as a pioneer?

Yes I do consider myself and my crew members to be pioneers. Being the first CTV company in the U.S. is extremely exciting. Atlantic Wind Transfers plans to be in the forefront in providing crew transfer services up and down the East Coast. When the U.S. offshore wind industry eventually begins to pick up steam and move forward there will be all kinds of opportunities for small-business owners to support the development of the massive supply chain that will be needed.

The Block Island Wind Farm has been running for over four years now and is still the U.S.’s only offshore wind farm. What’s taking so long? Why haven’t there been others?

There are actually two offshore wind farms now. The first was Block Island and now we have the second – Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind (CVOW) located 26 miles off Virginia Beach in federal waters.

Tell us about your recently signed contract with Dominion Energy in Virginia for your second CTV Atlantic Endeavor. Will it be similar to the Block Island vessel?

Atlantic Wind Transfers was selected through a competitive bid process to provide long-term O&M crew transfer services for Dominion Energy supporting the Siemens Gamesa turbines. The Atlantic Endeavor is an all-new CTV design called the Chartwell 24 developed by Andy Page of Chartwell Marine in the U.K. He was also the lead designer of Atlantic Pioneer when he worked for Southboats back in 2016. This will be the third Chartwell 24 entering the offshore wind market. The first two were built by Diverse Marine on the Isle of Wight for Seacat Services one of the leading CTV operators in Europe. Ours was built by Blount Boats in Warren Rhode Island who also built Atlantic Pioneer.

Has the coronavirus been a factor in the delay?

The pandemic along with permitting delays has had repercussions throughout the industry. The delay has pushed out the need for vessels to at least 2023 and possibly as far as 2025.

Do you see your home state Rhode Island as a future center of U.S. offshore wind?

Absolutely. Rhode Island is positioned right in the epicenter of the windiest lease areas off the Eastern Seaboard and being home to the first offshore wind farm in the U.S. does have its advantages. Rhode Island is close to all the offshore wind sites for Massachusetts New York and Connecticut so there will be supply chain needs that will flow into all the neighboring states. Rhode Island just announced plans to procure another 600 MW of offshore wind and is expected to be issuing a Request for Proposals by the end of next year.

Do you have plans to build other wind farm vessels in addition to CTVs – WTIVs (wind turbine installation vessels) for example?

No I don’t have any intention to move into the SOV or WITV sectors. Atlantic Wind Transfers will focus on CTVs. This is what we do best and we’ll be looking to grow our footprint down the East Coast.

What is the future of offshore wind in the U.S.? How big can it get? What other projects are on the drawing board?

There are currently only 42 MW of offshore wind installed here in the U.S. This includes the Block Island Wind Farm owned by Ørsted with five GE 6 MW turbines and Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind (CVOW) owned by Dominion Energy with two Siemens Gamesa 6 MW turbines. The offshore wind projects currently under contract versus future market potential is constantly in flux. Based on the latest data from the Business Network Offshore Wind the U.S. has 9121 MW of offshore wind currently under contract with future goals of upwards of 30 GW by 2035.

The first large scale project Vineyard Wind (800 MW) has been patiently waiting for BOEM to issue its Record of Decision which should hopefully be released in January. There are several Ørsted projects off Rhode Island New Jersey and Maryland that have also been delayed out to 2023-2024. Dominion Energy has been making headway on its larger 2.6 GW project off the coast of Virginia with full-scale construction beginning around 2024. The drawing board seems to be getting larger each year but we really need to kick off a large-scale project to give this industry a boost.

Will subsidies be necessary to make offshore wind a reality in domestic waters? What role do politics and federal regulations play in its development?

There are subsidies currently in place that are helping to jumpstart the industry but who knows how long they will last? Those incentives will be driven by politics and lobbying. The oil industry also has subsidies in place so it will be interesting to see how the green energy sector develops versus fossil fuels in the years to come. With a lot of companies developing net zero carbon goals and vessels looking to go hybrid to lower their NOx emissions the writing is on the wall and there will continue to be heavy pressure on the fossil fuel industry.

Where would you like to see Atlantic Wind Transfers in five years? What is your vision for the company?

My crystal ball? In five years we’ll grow our CTV fleet five-fold while continuing to be on the forefront of technology and design advancements. Our company will continue to innovate and collaborate with our European counterparts as we grow the business. We’ll be based in multiple states up and down the East Coast and possibly the West Coast providing a turnkey operating model that will benefit our clients in the years to come.

How would you describe your management style and company culture?

I would say I’m a pretty good boss. Most of our full-time employees have been with the company for over 15 years and their longevity reflects our company culture. We’re a family-owned business that was built from the ground up. Our employees’ dedication has helped grow Rhode Island Fast Ferry and Atlantic Wind Transfers to where we are today. They’re especially excited to grow with the offshore wind business knowing they’re leading the way in this once-in-a-lifetime new industry. Our employees have played an integral part in all of our company’s successes.

There is an ongoing debate among nonprofits providing homeless shelters on the best way to address homelessness. Should they focus on finding places for people to live regardless of what mental health or substance abuse problems they might have or should they stress equipping them with life skills even if it means a prolonged dependence upon the shelter?

As the staff of the Thurman Brisben Center has learned from serving the homeless of Greater Fredericksburg for 33 years — more than 7000 individuals since 2005— homelessness is complicated. From underemployment and unemployment to physical/mental disabilities from family breakups to poor credit histories and from addictions to criminal justice involvement the breadth of underlying causes is sobering.

The majority of homeless are working households and turn to shelters only as a last resort. A mere 14% — about 34 individuals locally — meet federal criteria for “chronic” (long-term) homelessness. However they are targeted to receive the most government funding to permanently house them. Continue reading →"

We put the brands head to head,"For most diehard fast food fans deciding what is better Domino’s or Pizza Hut is easy.

Whatever your preference it’s almost impossible to not have strong feelings on the subject. The chances are that you will be fiercely loyal to one of the two and wouldn’t be seen dead ordering from the other.

If anything can spark a blood feud it’s deciding where you should get your pizza from.

Objectively however not having a clear winner between two fast food heavyweights doesn’t help anyone. For newcomers to pizza ordering understanding the pros and cons is the most important part of the process.

That is where we come in.

What is better Domino’s or Pizza Hut?

To help settle the debate once and for all we’ve put together a little test. Using nine separate categories we’re going to put Domino’s and Pizza Hut head to head to finally establish which is better.

Whatever your personal views they are now irrelevant. Here finally is the answer to what is better Domino’s or Pizza Hut.

What is better Domino’s or Pizza Hut? – Credit: PA

The Pizza

The first and most important aspect is obviously the pizza itself. It is also the most contentious. However speaking purely objectively there are some undeniable home truths.

Domino’s is almost erotic in its indulgence. At age 28 it is now almost impossible for me to finish a Domino’s pizza without feeling gloriously sick. It’s like eating an entire jar of Nutella or downing a magnum of champagne. The results are disastrous but good God are they glorious.

Pizza Hut by contrast lacks the heart-attack-inducing potential of a Domino’s. The deep-pan base is almost focaccia-like in its fluffiness while the sauce is subtly sharper than its rival. It definitely won’t clog you up quite so quickly.

However despite Pizza Hut’s qualities there can only be one winner in this category. For pure flavour firepower Domino’s takes top spot.

Winner: Domino’s

The Size

Domino’s might deliver on taste but Pizza Hut definitely does it bigger.

While Domino’s caps its pies at 13.5 inches Pizza Hut goes all the way up to 14-inches with several options including Cheesy Bites All-American Thin and Stuffed-Crust.

If size is more important than substance Pizza Hut is your best bet.

Winner: Pizza Hut

The Toppings

Like most modern Pizza franchises both Domino’s and Pizza Hut provide a range of different topping options. Whether you want bacon barbecue chicken or ground beef both restaurants can deliver the goods.

However even though Domino’s specialises in outlandish and outrageous topping options including cheeseburgers and hotdogs what ultimately decides this category is the collaborations.

As part of the Yum! corporation Pizza Hut can collaborate with the likes of KFC and Taco Bell creating pizzas that Domino’s can only dream of. Anyone who was lucky enough to eat last year’s KFC popcorn chicken and gravy pizza knows what’s up.

Winner: Pizza Hut

The Price

Domino’s has a well-earned reputation for being a pricey takeaway option. Unless you’re ordering en masse it can be difficult to justify the cost.

However it turns out that for all Domino’s extortionate pricing Pizza Hut aren’t actually that far behind.

A large Domino’s Margherita will set you back around £17 in London. The Pizza Hut alternative by contrast is just £1.50 cheaper.

Pizza Hut might win this category but it’s by no means the most wallet-friendly option.

Winner: Pizza Hut

The Upgrades

Even though the pizza itself might be a little sub-par no one can deny that Pizza Hut puts the pedal to the metal when it comes to upgrades.

In addition to the aforementioned Cheesy-Bites and American Thin options Pizza Hut also offer deep pan pies and a variety of different doughs. The restaurant even invented stuffed crust for God’s sake.

Domino’s might deliver a stuffed crust option but if it’s variety that you’re after Pizza Hut is hard to beat.

Winner: Pizza Hut

The Extras

Four words for you – “Garlic and Herb Dip”. Whatever else Pizza Hut is bringing to the party pales into insignificance. You can have all the ice cream chicken bits and pasta salad in the world. Nothing will ever beat a big tub of Garlic and Herb.

End of.

Winner: Domino’s

The Special Offers

There was a period in my early teens where Domino’s made Tuesday the most exciting time of the week. The ongoing Two for Tuesday promotion has long been the most revered fast food offer around.

Suddenly £20 pepperoni pizzas became affordable for everyone. There was no excuse not to tuck in.

Pizza Hut might have brought in their own Twosday promotion but Domino’s are clearly the kings of this category.

Winner: Domino’s

The Availability

On the surface the fact that Pizza Hut also offers a dine-in option should help it run away with this category. However when you delve into the numbers there’s only one clear winner.

Although Pizza Hut is the most numerous pizza franchise on the planet with over 18000 locations around the world in the UK it is dwarfed by Domino’s.

The Hut only operates at 253 sites across the country versus over 1000 Domino’s restaurants. The buffet might be great but it just can’t compete with Domino’s availability.

Winner: Domino’s

The Impact

In their own way both restaurant chains have had a huge cultural impact in the UK. On a personal level I doubt my childhood would have been half as fun without Pizza Hut’s iconic ice cream station after a bowling birthday party.

However for all Pizza Hut’s exciting options there will never be a more iconic combo than Domino’s Sky One and The Simpsons after school. Never before or since has an advert been as intrinsic to a TV experience as Domino’s 5:59 slot on a weekday.

For millions of UK diners this was how we discovered Domino’s. Pizza Hut might be the bigger global brand but there’s a reason why it’s outnumbered four to one in Britain. Advertising clearly works.

Winner: Domino’s

Given my own inherent pro-Domino’s bias I was expecting this contest to be a lot less close than it was. The fact that it’s just five four proves what an impact both brands have had.

However as we promised at the start there can only be one winner. We can now definitely say that Domino’s is better than Pizza Hut.

Case closed.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVmYWxjb2hvbGljLmNvbS8yMDIxLzEvMzEvMjIyNTgyMjgvbWF0dGhldy1zdGFmZm9yZC10cmFkZS10by1yYW1zLWlzLXRoZS1maXJzdC1iaWctZG9taW5vLW9mLXdoYXQtY291bGQtYmUtYS1jcmF6eS1uZmwtb2Zmc2Vhc29u0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Matthew Stafford trade to Rams is the first big domino of what could be a crazy NFL offseason,"Last night we learned the Los Angeles Rams had traded Jared Goff two future first round picks and a future third round picks to the Detroit Lions for Matthew Stafford. The move was unexpected because we all knew the Rams would have to move Goff’s difficult contract to take on Stafford and there were doubts Detroit would want that but ultimately the two sides got a deal done.

It’s not just one of the strangest trades in recent memory in the NFL though it definitely is that. It’s a landscape shifter with massive implications for both teams the broader NFC the quarterback-needy teams spread out across the league and indeed our Atlanta Falcons. This morning let’s breeze through what this means for all the parties just mentioned.

The Rams: It’s now or never

Les Snead is the final remaining member of Thomas Dimitroff’s front office tree to still hold a general manager job. Where Dimitroff pushed the Falcons back into relevance and came agonizingly close to a Super Bowl before flaming out and where Dave Caldwell sort of got the Jaguars going again before doing the same Snead has proven to be the ultimate survivor. He’s now not only made the transition from Jeff Fisher to Sean McVay a coach he gets quite a bit of credit for hiring but also survived trading a massive haul up to #1 to take the quarterback he just moved and giving away close to adecade of first round picks in various moves.

It’s hard to overstate Snead and his front office’s appetite for risk but they are betting heavily on their own ability to evaluate top-shelf talent after the first round and are also betting they’ll be the NFC’s top dog the next couple of years. They saw that the Packers and Buccaneers are reliant on aging quarterbacks and saw Jared Goff’s limitations dragging them down and decided to go for it getting a clear upgrade at quarterback. All the massive contracts Snead handed out and those lack of first round picks paired with the team losing their well-regarded college scouting director in Brad Holmes means their best bet is to win the big one right now and worry about the future later. If they don’t this trade is going to be viewed unfavorably when they’re not drafting in the first round in 2023.

The Lions: The rebuild starts now

Detroit clearly views themselves as being in the beginning stages of a true rebuild one that will not wrap up in a year. They now have a pair of future first round picks to go with a brand new coach and general manager and Jared Goff is either going to be their quarterback for the future or a two year bridge to the future.

Either way Detroit is stepping back and acknowledging they’re not there and they’re not close to being there. The Packers may well be a couple years away from starting over themselves the Bears and Vikings have uncertain futures with unsettled quarterback situations and some of the NFC’s heaviest hitters like the Rams and Buccaneers are reliant on cores that probably won’t stay together beyond 2022. With Goff’s contract allowing for Detroit to get out following that season the Lions will take an earlier return to contention but likely aren’t expecting to be anywhere near great again until 2023.

Detroit has undergone these kinds of teardowns and rebuilds in the past but the hope is that they have the right people for it this time around. They’ll also hope that Goff can somehow flourish away from Sean McVay a bet that only a former Rams personnel guru would make but if he stinks they’ll stick with their timeline.

The NFC: The balance of power shifts

Who will be the great teams in the NFC a year from now? If Tom Brady doesn’t finally fall apart in the offseason the Buccaneers figure to be one. The Packers figure to be another assuming Aaron Rodgers is around and still great. And the Rams are of course putting their nuts on the table for 2021 with the Seahawks figuring to be in the conversation Washington maybe making a push if they get their quarterback Dallas if Dan Quinn can un-Mike Nolan the defense and the 49ers if they also sort out their quarterback conundrum.

There aren’t a lot of great teams on paper right now though and the Rams become an early favorite in that power vacuum. They’ll have a very good quarterback still in his prime with a gifted roster and one of the most highly-regarded coaching staffs in the league albeit one that just lost a hotshot young defensive coordinator. With Tampa Bay and Green Bay having to at least worry that their 44 year old and 37 year old quarterbacks will decline or get hurt next year Los Angeles is seizing an opportunity and making it clear the NFC could run through them.

Quarterback needy teams: Uh oh

The Panthers and Football Team were among those who reportedly struck out in their pursuit of Stafford. This deal is a wakeup call for those teams who now see what they’re going to have to shell out.

Obviously Stafford for Goff and picks is an odd trade that won’t be replicated but it sets a daunting market. If you want Deshaun Watson you may have to start at three first round picks given that the Rams surrendered a former top quarterback and two future firsts. If you want Aaron Rodgers the price will be less steep but still figures to involve multiple firsts. Hell that’s probably true if you want Matt Ryan which we’ll get to in a minute.

There are probably 4-5 top quarterbacks in this class teams will view as worthy of a first round pick and a handful of franchise quarterbacks you might be able to swing a deal for. If you’re one of the dozen or so teams that likely wants to upgrade your quarterback situation this offseason the price you’re going to need to pay to do so just crystallized a bit. Some teams are going to have to wait or paper over their needs for this year either because they’ll be left behind when other teams swing deals or because they won’t have the assets or the heart to part with assets that will be necessary to take a stab at solving that quarterback need in 2021. If you’re a team that wants to contend now that’s the big decision you’re facing and it’s not an easy one.

The Falcons: Sitting pretty

Atlanta’s options are the same as they were a couple of days ago but their position also got stronger.

Matt Ryan is unlikely to be moved but it’s clear the Falcons can and would ask for multiple first round picks for him. Ryan is older than Matthew Stafford but is also a former NFL MVP who is aging pretty gracefully and the idea that the Falcons would ship him out for a future second round pick or some nonsense should be put to bed after seeing this deal. If a team wants to blow Atlanta away and make them consider eating their big dead cap hit to move him it’s clear what they’ll have to give up and it’s quite a bit.

In the much likelier case that the Falcons keep him teams are now just a little bit more likely to blow them away with an offer for the #4 pick. Stafford and Goff were both potential trade targets and are now both off the market and it’s not clear whether any other veteran quarterbacks worth making a move for are actually on the block. That leaves teams outside of the top 5 picks starting down the prospect of not being able to get one of the top draft-eligible quarterbacks and if you’re a Broncos team not sold on Drew Lock or a 49ers team getting antsy about Jimmy G that’s an unfortunate position to be in.

If Atlanta wants to move down then and Trey Lance Justin Fields and Mac Jones are on the board at #4 they shouldn’t lack for suitors who know they won’t be able to get away with a miserly offer to move up 5 or 10 picks. The Falcons can do with those offers what they will but they’re as well-positioned to trade down and secure a haul as they’ve been in many many years.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWdhbWVyLmNvbS9wb2tlbW9uLW1vdmVzLXBvd2VyZnVsLWRhbWFnZS1rby1zZXQtY29tcGV0aXRpdmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,15 Pokemon Moves That Do The Most HP Damage To Their Opponent Ranked,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWdhbWVyLmNvbS9wb2tlbW9uLW1vdmVzLXBvd2VyZnVsLWRhbWFnZS1rby1zZXQtY29tcGV0aXRpdmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVtcGlyZWFkdmFuY2UuY2EvbWFuaXRvYmEtbmV3cy93aW5uaXBlZy1wZXJpbWV0ZXItZG9taW5vLWNyYXNoLW1pbm9yLWluanVyaWVzLTQyOTY2MTXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Winnipeg Perimeter domino crash minor injuries,"In late afternoon traffic on Winnipeg Perimeter Hwy an eastbound traffic pile-up involved five vehicles. At about 5:00 p.m. Jan.

In late afternoon traffic on Winnipeg Perimeter Hwy an eastbound traffic pile-up involved five vehicles.

At about 5:00 p.m. Jan. 28 an RCMP Traffic Services officer was on patrol when he saw a collision that had just occurred in the eastbound lanes of the Perimeter Highway at Pipeline Road. He immediately called for assistance; a 911 call was also received by the RCMP Operational Communications Centre. When the officer pulled up to the scene traffic was starting to back up and there was debris all over the roadway.

It was observable on scene that an SUV had been struck from behind which caused the SUV to strike a transit van which then struck a car which hit a pickup truck. A semi was parked on the shoulder approximately 20 metres from the collision scene and witnesses reported the semi was involved in the collision as well. As the officer was checking on people involved in the collision the semi started to drive away. The semi turned south onto Pipeline Road.

The officer got in his vehicle and initiated a traffic stop on the semi. The driver was arrested for Failing to Remain at the Scene of a Collision.

An investigation has determined that the four vehicles that were hit were stopped at the traffic light at Pipeline Road when the SUV was struck by the semi causing a chain reaction that then included the van car and pickup truck being struck.

The 57-year-old female driver of the SUV from the RM of St. Andrews was taken to hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. The 48-year-old male driver of the van from Selkirk was not seriously injured. The 25-year-old male driver of the car from East St. Paul was not injured but he did have a suspended licence and will receive a ticket for that offence.

The 26-year-old male driver of the semi from Winnipeg has been charged with several Highway Traffic Act offences and a Serious Offence Notice at this time. Further charges under the Criminal Code may be considered."

Last week the popular stock among retailer investors on Reddit forum WallStreetBets soared 400% amid extreme trading volume and volatility. AMC Entertainment — another short squeeze target that jumped 277% last week — closed flat on Monday.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 229.29 points or 0.8% to 30211.91 led by Microsoft and Visa. The S&P 500 climbed 1.6% to 3773.86 posting its best day since Nov. 24 as all 11 sectors gained. The Nasdaq Composite jumped 2.6% to 13403.39.

Stocks jumped on Monday the first session of February as Wall Street appeared to shake off concerns about a speculative retail trading mania that largely drove the market's worst weekly sell-off since October.

Many on Wall Street were spooked by a frenzy of activity among retail traders in heavily-shorted stocks including GameStop and AMC Entertainment which caused hedge funds to take off risk across the board even if they weren't directly involved in the trade. Goldman Sachs said that the short squeeze triggered by the buying spree is the most extreme in 25 years. However some strategists believe it's unlikely that the impact will ripple through Wall Street and derail the new bull market.

""The return of volatility over the past week has been driven by market positioning rather than worries over growth"" Mark Haefele chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management said in a note.

""Many institutions have been adjusting their books to account for the risks to short positions arising from recent coordinated buying by retail investors. But given the speed and magnitude of flows in recent days we think most of the pressure is now behind us"" Haefele said.

Popular online brokerage Robinhood said Monday it raised another $2.4 billion from investors as the manic retail trading forced its clearinghouse to increase deposit requirements by tenfold last week. The funding could be a sign that investors are confident the broker can ride out the market turmoil.

All three major averages slipped more than 3% last week for their worst weekly performance since October. The Dow and S&P also posted losses for January — the first negative month in three — although the Nasdaq did manage to post a gain for the month.

""Despite the uncertainty surrounding the fallout from the surge in prices for stocks with substantial levels of short interest we don't see the advent of a 1998-style liquidity crisis"" Sam Stovall chief investment strategist at CFRA said in a note. ""Even though we think the equity market needs to go through a readjustment of expectations and valuations we don't think the bull has come to an end nor are we recommending any changes to our year-end S&P 500 target or asset allocation.""

The Reddit boom seemed to be spreading to other areas of the market however. Futures contracts for silver surged as much as 11% and settled 9.3% higher the biggest one-day jump in 11 years. The Reddit chat room had multiple active threads dedicated to silver while the phrase ""#silversqueeze"" was trending on Twitter at one point.

Meanwhile a group of 10 Republican senators sent President Joe Biden a letter on Sunday urging him to consider a smaller scaled-down Covid-19 relief proposal. His current plan calls for $1.9 trillion in additional fiscal stimulus.

The Republican proposal would reduce the size of a new round of checks Biden wants to send to Americans from $1400 per individual to $1000. It would also make the income limits that determine eligibility for the stimulus payments far stricter. For individual filers the checks would start to phase out for those making more than $40000.

Jaydyn Carr was a GameStop shareholder long before the buying frenzy that sent share prices skyrocketing and now the 10-year-old investor has cashed in making almost $3200.

His mother Nina Carr told CNN that she bought Jaydyn 10 shares of the company’s stock in 2019 as a Kwanzaa present because she wanted to teach him about investing.

The San Antonio fifth grader loves video games so the stock was a natural choice.

“We were always there two years ago just buying different video games” she said. “I was like ‘I can give him the shares the GameStop and give him something tangible to hold on to and that way he can appreciate it that way.’”

She bought the shares for about $60 and printed out a stock certificate which she framed and gift wrapped. He’d been wanting an XBox One but said he liked the gift.

“It was very cool that I got stock in one of the companies that I mostly used” Jaydyn said.

He would occasionally look at the stock price for fun but said his mom taught him to think of it as a long-term investment.

GameStop stock (GME) has risen more than 1500% for the year. The gains have largely been driven by a group of investors on Reddit who are buying the stock to hurt short sellers and hedge funds that had bet on the stock to go down.

Carr has been an active investor for about five years and had set up an alert to keep track of the stock price.

On Wednesday morning her phone started going crazy. She saw that the stock had reached $350 and was going up and down dramatically.

She ran to get her son who was doing his virtual school work in his room and quickly explained what was going on. She asked him what he wanted to do.

“I wanted to sell it then and there because I knew it could drop in seconds” Jaydyn said.

They ended up selling the stock for about $320 per share for a total of almost $3200 Carr said.

It was Jaydyn’s first stock but he said he’s researching his next purchases.

Carr said she’s teaching her son about investing saving credit card debt and other financial topics he’ll need to understand as he gets older.

“We’re African American. You don’t see a lot of that in our community” she said. “I wanted to give him a step up when it comes to learning these things because I learned it later in life and I wish I had known sooner.”

His dad died in 2014 which made his mom determined to make sure Jaydyn was financially literate.

“He’s my legacy” she said. “I have to make sure that he’s prepared for the future.”

Jaydyn is putting $2000 in his savings account and plans to invest $1000.

He said he’d like to buy shares in Microsoft and Roblox a popular online game company that is preparing for its IPO.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMS8wMS8zMS9idXNpbmVzcy90b3lzLXItdXMtY2xvc3VyZXMvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBPmh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uLzIwMjEvMDEvMzEvYnVzaW5lc3MvdG95cy1yLXVzLWNsb3N1cmVz?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Toys 'R' Us has closed all its stores -- again,"New York CNN Business —

Toys “R” Us is closing its only two stores roughly a year after a highly anticipated relaunch of the storied brand.

Tru Kids Inc. which bought the retailer in a 2018 liquidation sale confirmed that its two locations in New Jersey and Texas that opened in late 2019 have permanently closed because of the pandemic.

“As a result of Covid-19 we made the strategic decision to pivot our store strategy to new locations and platforms that have better traffic” a Tru Kids spokesperson told CNN Business. They added that demand for the brand “remains strong” and the company will continue to invest in it.

Toys “R” Us’ website remains operational and more than 700 stores outside of the United States are still open.

The two stores had a smaller footprint compared to its predecessor that dotted US suburbs. They sold fewer toys and instead focused on interactive and playground-like environments for brands. Ultimately the plan was to open around 10 of them in malls.

Like other retailers Toys “R” Us was hurt by the mall closures last year and shifting consumer habits that prompted people to shop online or at big-box stores."

But wait—there’s more! HSforBC’s Executive Director Susan Austin has pulled a kitty from her magical hat of tricks and has lined up “America’s Cat Daddy” Jackson Galaxy as the speaker for the VIP Virtual Viewing Party!

Galaxy a renowned cat behaviorist and author is the host of the hit television show “My Cat From Hell” featured on Animal Planet. Thanks to Austin’s well-penned plea to Galaxy he will be entertaining the VIPs with his witty cat stories followed by a Q&A session.

Why Is HSforBC an Important Organization to Our County?

HSforBC provides food health care vaccinations and spay-and-neuter services for all animals in its care. It is 100% volunteer operated and receives no tax dollars. In addition to its need of volunteers to help work at the shelter and to foster animals there is a need for donations of requested items and monetary donations that will go toward the care of the animals and day-to-day operations of the shelter. HSforBC’s efforts and services have been even more critical to the community this past year as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

This annual Fur Ball raises awareness and funds that are crucial to its operating budget and to its volunteer board and staff.

A Virtual “Pawty” Loaded With Fun!

Zionsville Monthly is proud to be a long-standing sponsor of HSforBC’s Fur Ball and joining us this year in addition to the presenting sponsor—TDS Telecom—are fellow sponsors (including but not limited to) Dentons Bingham Greenebaum as the VIP Virtual Viewing Party sponsor D.R. Horton Homes as the online auction sponsor Tracy Ridings Realtor/Broker with F.C.

HSforBC is putting together an online auction that will include some unique and exciting items including a chance to bid on naming a litter of puppies or kittens that are in the care of HSforBC. The online auction will go live a week prior to the Fur Ball and will end that following Sunday.

All contest prizes and auction items will be scheduled for pickup from the shelter following the virtual event.

“The VIP Virtual Viewing Party will start at 7 p.m.” Austin shared. “The VIP preparty is ticketed and the entire event will be run on a virtual platform. Then at 7:30 p.m. we’ll throw the ‘doors’ open—NO leash required—and then everyone can join in [virtually]. Tickets will go on sale at the first of February and will be $500 which provides 10 emails to access to the virtual gala and $50 for individual tickets with single email access.”

Although the event will be all virtual it is guaranteed to be lively and fun! Attendees are encouraged to get creative and have fun with the Mardi Gras theme. For the first time in the event’s history Austin and her team will be presenting the event live from the shelter!

“We’ll share what we did and our successes in 2020 along with a couple of stories from our fosters and caretakers” Austin said. “We’ll highlight our programs including how we expanded our pet pantry program as well as showcase some of our adoptable critters—live from our shelter!”

teagle@monroenews.com

A longtime local politician is taking his experience in policy-making and applying it to lobbying.

Jason Sheppard the former Republican representative of the 56th District has accepted an advocacy position with Kelley Cawthorne a government relations firm headquartered in Lansing.

Sheppard a Temperance resident served in the Legislature for three terms from 2015-20 leaving the post due to term limits. The district he represented included most southern and western municipalities in Monroe County.

“When considering my next challenge I wanted to remain active in shaping Michigan’s future and work with an organization that can truly effect change” Sheppard said.

During his time in office Sheppard served as the House Majority Whip and the chair of the House Government Operations Committee.

Additionally he sat on committees that addressed issues related to health policy tourism recreation financial services transportation infrastructure elections and ethics. He also previously served as a Monroe County commissioner and worked as a realtor in the area.

In a press statement Kelley Cawthorne leadership said Sheppard’s experience and in-depth knowledge of policy issues would be beneficial to the firm.

Melissa McKinley a principal at the firm said Kelley Cawthorne is a leading government relations firm in the state particularly when it comes to job creators healthcare and education.

“By adding (Sheppard’s) public policy and legislative expertise we are expanding our state government presence in Lansing and extending our reach into Ohio as well” McKinley said.

The firm pointed to Sheppard’s work on auto insurance reform as being a prime example of his work in the state Capitol.

Sheppard was a driving force behind reforms to Michigan’s no-fault auto insurance industry which consistently ranked as the most expensive in the state often double the national average.

He and other legislators led an effort to make changes to the often controversial law. The new market went into effect last year.

“Reducing car insurance rates has been my top priority since I first started serving our community in Lansing” Sheppard said in a statement days before the changes went into effect.

“I’m proud to report that the people of Monroe County will finally start to see changes that make it more affordable to drive in Michigan.”

Prior to leaving office Sheppard also was a vocal critic of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and restrictions placed on businesses as the state helmed its responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.

He often was critical of measures that limited businesses’ operations particularly restaurants and entertainment venues.

Pointing to his community’s proximity to Ohio he noted that many residents took their business over the state line resulting in local establishments losing revenue and suffering as a result of mandated closures.

Kelley Cawthorne also has offices in Detroit and Grand Rapids. Founded in 1999 it works with several clients and advertises its services as bipartisan.

Some of its clients includes Wayne State University Detroit; Karmanos Cancer Center; Ford Motor Co.; DTE Energy; Walmart and AT&T.

“I am excited to put my years of public policy experience and small business background to work at a firm like Kelley Cawthorne” Sheppard said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Shannon Clark a fourth-grade language arts and social studies teacher is a resident of Mount Dora. She has been teaching for seven years and was announced the winner at Thursday night’s Teacher of the Year celebration hosted by the Education Foundation of Lake County and presented by Duke Energy Ernie Morris Enterprises and Jenkins Auto Group.

Clark was named the winner by a panel of judges from outside the district who reviewed her application interviewed administrators and peers and observed her in the classroom.

In addition to demonstrating student performance gains Clark is often used as a model for first-year and teacher teams. In her application Clark said her classroom has been visited by educators who observed her whole-group instruction and small-group remediation as well as how she collaborates with other teachers.

Clark wrote in her application about her teaching students in a Title 1 school: “Their learning inspires me. No matter if it’s increasing their words per minute or hearing them read with expression. I love to see their smiles after they’ve passed a test or achieved a higher grade on a retest. I love sharing in their sense of accomplishment.”

”Whether someone is watching or not Mrs. Clark is going to give her very best to students every minute of every day. It is clear that her motivation is intrinsic and fueled by her love for students” said Dr. Tiffany Scott principal at Eustis Heights Elementary. “I wish that her example will be used to elevate the practice of teaching and learning districtwide. I also wish that passions she has influenced on our campus for both students and staff are felt across the district and send a message of hope and inspiration.”

In addition to the designation as Lake County’s 2022 Teacher of the Year Clark will receive a 2021 Honda Accord from Jenkins Auto Group that she’ll be able to drive for three years. Insight Credit Union has donated a $500 gas card and Jostens will present her with an official Teacher of the Year ring.

While the category has seen several upgrades and design changes the iPod Classic was a huge success and bolstered Apple's penetration in the industry. Now Guy Dupont has modified his 17-year old iPod classic as he managed to stream Spotify on the hardware. It's amazing to see the iPod classes running Spotify since the music streaming service arrived later in the years to come.

17-Year Old iPod Classic Modded to Stream Spotify See the Click Wheel in Action

While Guy Dupont removed the internals of the iPod classic it is still good to see the popular Click Wheel in action. However what is even more surprising is that you do not need to connect to iTunes to make the magic happen. Moreover the modification did not make use of a specific hack or jailbreak. Instead it relied on new hardware as iPod classic internals were removed.

The iPod Classic hardware was replaced by Raspberry Pi Zero W. In addition to this the Click Wheel was able to perform its natural functions through Raspberry. Since the display of the iPod Classic was removed it was replaced with a new LCD a motor for haptic feedback along a 1000mAh battery. Since the iPod Classic was a hefty device compared to what we use today this allowed Dupont to add more batteries to the mix. Check out the video below for more details on the hack.

Once all the hardware requirements were in place Dupont used Python to program the functionality of the Click Wheel. This allowed the iPod Classic to play music of any format. Moreover you also get the ability to search Spotify playlists and have access to your library. The best part is that all of the listed functionality can be performed wirelessly. The black and green Spotify theme is on point as well.

That's all there is to it folks. It's great to see users coming up with ways to make use of older hardware. However the hack seems to be reliant on Raspberry. However the incorporation and use of a Click Wheel are admirable. We will share more hacks like these in the future so be sure to stick around. Let us know your thoughts in the comments.",,,,,,,,,

Eastman Chairman and CEO Mark Costa and Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee announced the plastics chemicals and fibers corporation’s plans Friday. The company will develop the facility at its Kingsport site over the next two years. It will support Eastman’s commitment to addressing global waste solutions and mitigating challenges created by climate change while also creating value for its stakeholders according to a news release from the governor.

“With the growing demand for products made with recycled content and the urgent need to address the global plastic waste crisis now is the time for Eastman to take this step. We are grateful for our partnership with Governor Lee in making today’s announcement possible” Costa said.

The facility which is expected to be complete by the end of 2022 will help address the globe’s plastic waste crisis. Company officials hope the facility will recycle more than 500 million pounds of plastic waste annually via molecular recycling technologies by 2030 the release states. The company has committed to recycling more than 250 million pounds of plastic waste per year by 2025.

Through methanolysis Eastman’s facility will convert polyester waste which often ends up in landfills waterways and elsewhere into durable products. Polyester cannot be recycled using regular methods according to Eastman. The methanolysis process uses heat pressure and methanol to break down polyesters. It will then be transformed into new products.

The facility will use more than 100000 metric tons of plastic waste to produce high-quality specialty plastics. The process should reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 20% to 30% relative to fossil feedstocks the release states.

Eastman is one of the pioneers in developing methanolysis technology at commercial scale and has more than three decades of expertise in this recycling process the release states.

Costa said the project will be a great investment for the local community and Eastman’s customers while also creating small business jobs to develop the recycling infrastructure needed to support investment in a sustainable future.

“Eastman has been a leader in the materials sector for over 100 years and continues to be a valued partner to our state” Lee said. “I’d like to thank the company for investing in Kingsport and its highly skilled workforce and for focusing on innovative technology that enhances the quality of life for people not just in Tennessee but around the world.”

Costa said the facility is just part of Eastman’s overall circular economic strategy.

“Eastman employs more than one-third of the Tennesseans that work in our state’s chemical industry and we applaud the company for expanding its capabilities in Kingsport while reaffirming its commitment to sustainability” Tennessee Economic Development Commissioner Bob Rolfe said in a news release from the agency. “The groundbreaking work done at Eastman’s Sullivan County headquarters makes an international impact and we are proud that the company continues to grow and invest in Northeast Tennessee.”

Local state legislators applauded the news.

“I’m excited with the opportunity for Eastman and the region” said state Sen. Jon Lundberg R-Bristol. “We are all pleased Eastman continues to invest in Sullivan County and create job opportunities. This is a truly new phase of growth for Eastman and we appreciate work done by Governor Lee and others to facilitate this major investment.”

Rep. Bud Hulsey R-Kingsport said “Eastman has made significant contributions to our community over the last one hundred years. I am grateful they are continuing to invest in our district’s most valuable resource — our workforce.”

Born in Easton Pennsylvania on May 27 1926 he was the son of Paul Eaton a professor at Lafayette College and Hannah (Wilkins). An only child Jack’s academic prowess was apparent early: He graduated from high school at 16 and enlisted in the U.S. Army near the end of World War II.

After earning a degree in biology from Lafayette College in 1947 Jack moved to New York City and settled in Greenwich Village where he embraced the life of a bohemian finding work as a page in the burgeoning world of television at NBC Studios.

Jack first became entranced by the story of the Titanic at age 20 when he saw artist Harper Goff’s painting of the sinking liner in Esquire: It was the start of a lifelong passionate interest which would eventually take him to three continents in pursuit of the Titanic’s history. After the immense interest in the ship following the release of the British film A Night to Remember in 1958 Jack became the founding historian in 1963 of the Titanic Enthusiasts of America (now the Titanic Historical Society). In 1989 he would co-found the Titanic International Society with Charles Haas.

In 1986 Jack’s first book on the disaster co-written with Haas Titanic: Triumph and Tragedy was published. It featured many research discoveries including the first publication of the ship’s cargo stowage plan cargo manifest details of post-sinking lawsuits and a full account of the role of the Halifax. By its third edition in 2011 the book included more than 1000 photographs and was known in maritime circles as “the Titanic Bible.”

Jack was co-historian on the first Titanic research and recovery expedition in 1993 when at the age of 67 he became the oldest person to make the perilous 12500-foot dive to the ship’s wreck and debris field.

Jack appeared on innumerable television and radio documentaries about the lost liner and served as advisor on several Titanic artifact exhibitions as well as to National Geographic. His other books include Falling Star: Misadventures of White Star Line Ships (1989) and Titanic: A Journey Through Time (1999; now in its third edition). His only non-maritime book was his first published in 1982 which combined his love of felines and cuisine: The Disgusting Despicable Cat Cookbook.

When not focused on maritime history Jack spent 40 years of his post-bohemian life as an admitting officer at Roosevelt Hospital often working in the emergency room where he witnessed New York City at its grittiest including the night in 1980 when John Lennon was shot and killed.

After his retirement in 1995 Jack moved to Cold Spring settling in the lower village where he drew attention and made friends while walking his dog Dexter. He was frequently sought after as a lecturer and guest speaker and served for four years on the village Planning Board.

Jack has no family surviving. Memorial donations may be made to the Titanic International Society P.O. Box 416 Midland Park NJ 07432-0416 or to a favorite charity especially those preserving ocean-liner history or supporting classical music. The Titanic International Society also invites friends to send memories and stories to [email protected] with the subject line “Eaton tribute” or by mail with the envelope marked “Eaton Tribute.”

The Harlem Renaissance mesmerized the United States from the mid-1910s to the 1930s with an embrace of African American creative arts—music literature theatre and visual artistry. The cultural movement that sparked the Jazz Age also carried a rising demand for equality in the face of segregation disenfranchisement and violence against people of color. The Harlem Renaissance with its ceremonial home in New York City celebrated African American culture amid calls for change.

Sponsored by Illinois State University’s Multi-Ethnic Cultural and Co-curricular Programming Advisory Committee (MECCPAC) the School of Music and the School of Music Committee on Representation Equity Diversity and Inclusion Harlem Sings – A Tribute to the Poets of the Harlem Renaissance will feature poetry from authors such as Langston Hughes James Weldon Johnson Georgia Douglass Johnson Countee Cullen and Clarissa Scott Delany.

Longtime visitors will notice a fresh look and renewed commitment to history at the New Brighton gallery that still offers free admission.

Energy-efficient LED lighting placed at new angles give a brighter warmer visual appeal to the 18th- and 19th-century paintings lining the walls and the Victorian era artifacts on display.

Century-old stylish hats and coats travel accessories kitchen items and an 1850s hotel registry are recent additions highlighting New Brighton's days as a booming canal town. Many of those items were rescued from a neglected water-damaged pile of possessions stored in a former fire hall on Eighth Avenue sold by the Merrick Art Gallery last August to pay for building improvements.

That sales revenue paid for roof and gutter repairs three re-pointed chimneys re-glazed windows and a fresh coat of paint to the exterior lamp posts and sconces of the museum and gallery founded by New Brighton industrialist Edward Dempster Merrick (1832 -1911).

New in charge

The improvements were arranged by Michelle Long who was named the Merrick Art Gallery's new director a few weeks ago.

In a Jan. 20 newsletter to Merrick members the board of trustee's Karen Merrick Capper a descendant of the gallery's namesake founder hailed Long as someone who brings a wealth of professional experience.

Having served as the gallery's acting director the prior 18 months Long co-founded and serves as president of the Rochester Area Heritage Society Museum & Model Railroad and had worked as an office manager for the Rochester Area School District and Rochester Chamber of Commerce.

A scholarship recipient to the Art Institute of Pittsburgh Long was somewhat of an informal package deal as she brought with her husband Jim Long who maintains the Merrick as a volunteer relying on his experience as the retired head of maintenance at Eaton Corp.

The couple keeps busy tinkering with and tweaking the Merrick.

""The things they have accomplished I can't even put into words"" Capper said. ""This place has never looked like this before.""

Jim updated the Merrick gallery's lighting and convinced the trustees to no longer allow loud indoor Motown-themed concerts where vibrations can crack the centuries-old paintings Capper said.

The Merrick's outdoor garden refinished last year now becomes a new spot for fundraising concerts including one tentatively planned for this summer starring Beaver Valley rockers The Granati Brothers.

According to Capper there's a newfound spirit and vigor at the Merrick where the 2021 events schedule includes a Kentucky Derby-themed ""Night at The Races"" in May a garden party a picnic a murder mystery a women's Christmas tea and a handbell concert by Ring Pittsburgh all on dates to be announced.

Long first came to the Merrick in 2019 for what she thought would be a temporary task helping the then-new director Elinka Keller straighten out the gallery's finances. Keller brought with her new ideas for events and marketing as well as an enthusiasm that inspired others.

""Elinka had her ways"" Long said. ""When she brought me in to help she swore it would only be a couple of days. She said 'Just help me Michelle. I've taken on this director's job and I can't do it all.' ""

Keller grew ill unexpectedly and died in August 2019. Long stayed on as acting director carrying out her predecessor's vision.

""When people coming into the gallery were saying how much it's changed and they enjoy coming here then I wanted to stay"" Long said. ""That's why I'm still here.""

Covid brought quiet

Last year brought the immense challenge of a pandemic.

""It was kind of quiet because of the COVID"" Long said. ""We had to cancel a lot of weddings bridal showers and rentals.""

With a sizable rental room and the outside garden the Merrick is ""a little better off"" than some rental sites with the return of social distanced events Long said.

""I'm looking forward to getting more people back in here"" she said.

The Merrick reopened Jan. 19 after a holiday break.

Open 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Tuesdays Wednesdays and Thursdays throughout winter the summer could bring additional weekend hours.

Controversial statue

The Merrick's redesigned music room showcases a piano played by famous 19th- century Pittsburgh composer Stephen Foster ""The Father of American Music"" when he stayed and entertained guests at the Merrick Inn in New Brighton. The hotel was destroyed by an 1890s fire. Foster sheet music believed to be from the 19th century is part of the Merrick gallery's collection.

Long and Capper are looking into a suggestion from a local doctor for the Merrick to obtain and display in its garden a controversial 118-year-old Stephen Foster statue removed from Pittsburgh's Oakland section last year after a public outcry claiming it was racially insensitive. The Pittsburgh Art Commission held two public hearings to gather opinions from concerned citizens. The commission ultimately sided with those who took offense with the statue depicting a barefoot black man playing a banjo at Foster's feet.

Critics said the statue was demeaning; others defended the statue saying it shows Foster was inspired by black spirituals.

For generations the 800-pound bronze monument now in storage had stood prominently on Forbes Avenue in Pittsburgh near the Carnegie museums.

""I'd be very excited to have it be part of our gallery"" Long said. ""I think it's history and history needs to be out and seen for people to learn about it.""

The future

Best known for its collection of French ﻿German English and American paintings from the 18th and 19th centuries including ﻿examples of romantic realistic and Impressionistic art The Merrick also offers visual curiosities like Edward Dempster Merrick's rocks and minerals collection a mastodon's tooth and an intricate dollhouse wider than your outstretched arms.

The pile of belongings in the old fire hall purchased eight years ago by Merrick Gallery officials for storage yielded a number of century-old items now on display such as clothing and frames.

""All of this stuff to me belongs with this building"" Long said.

Long said if she were younger she would have bought the old fire hall herself.

""It was really cool. But (the Merrick) didn't need it. We were paying taxes on it. We were paying utilities on it"" she said. ""It was filled with junk and stuff in there that was probably nice at one time but was ruined because of water leaks and hot and cold. So I decided to get out from under it. I put it on Market Place on Facebook and within 15 minutes I sold it. We brought the valuables down here and everything else went. That helped us be able to redo the garden.""

Also on her 2021 to-do list is to install an electronic signboard so the public can learn about upcoming Merrick programs and events.

Read our ethics policy

Article Hero Image

A rare functional example of Apple's first computer the Apple 1 is up for sale on eBay with its seller asking a cool $1.5 million for the privilege of owning a piece of tech history.

According to the item's description first spotted by IGN the model is verified as original by Corey Cohen an Apple 1 expert whose knowledge is often sought for appraisals at larger auctions.

Known as the ""Canadian"" on Mike Willegal's Apple-1 registry the example on eBay is one of six known surviving units to come housed in an original Byte Shop KOA wood case. It comes with an original power supply and Datanetics Version D keyboard as well as a period-correct Sony TV-115 monitor with video modulator.

The Apple 1 board is unmodified and in ""almost perfect"" condition according to the seller. It is also one of few remaining units to be fully operational a point proved when it ran for over six hours a day while on display at the Vintage Computer Festival West in 2019.

Current owner Krishna B. Blake purchased the Apple 1 in 1978 from its original owner as part of a trade-in deal for a newer Apple II. Blake's computer store in Montreal was responsible for Apple II maintenance prior to Apple's entry into Canada.

Despite its pedigree and current state the Apple 1 on sale through eBay might not fetch Blake's $1.5 million asking price. Other examples have come close to the $1 million barrier the closest being a 2014 sale worth $905000 but more recent auctions have drawn bids below $500000.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBjZ2FtZXIuY29tL3dpdGgtYS1ibGFjay1sb3R1cy1zb2xkLWF0LWRvbGxhcjUwMGstbWFnaWMtdGhlLWdhdGhlcmluZy1oaXRzLWEtbmV3LWxldmVsL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,With a Black Lotus sold at $500k Magic: The Gathering hits a new level,"An alpha Black Lotus the most infamous Magic: The Gathering card ever produced was sold at auction on eBay for $511100. Organized by trading card investment firm PWCC it's the first single Magic CCG card to sell for over half a million dollars at open auction. Other collectible card game cards may have sold for more usually unique single-printing cards but if they did there's no public record of it. Past Alpha Black Lotus cards have gone for as much as $250k.

To top it off the case is signed by now-deceased Magic artist Christopher Rush who painted the art for the card. Rush's artwork set the tone for not just the first Magic set but for the series as a whole. He died in 2016.

The Alpha series of Magic cards are the very first set ever printed in 1993. It's infamous as a powerful card the most powerful in the first set of cards and has been banned from play for years. Only 1100 copies of the Alpha Black Lotus ever existed with many lost to time or wear and this one is of exceptional quality. It was graded a 10 by PSA one of the most respected valuation services in collectible card games. The auctioneer PWCC said that the card was “by all counts the single finest Alpha Black Lotus we’ve had the pleasure of brokering.""

It's a wild ride in terms of the collectibles world and it's more proof than ever that nerd stuff has taken over the world. Black Lotus' rarity practically ensures that it's going to remain for as long as Magic remains the most valuable CCG trading card ever printed for sale. I'll update you when we hit $750k and a cool million respectively.

It has also settled directly with about 1000 plaintiffs who had sued over damage from the series of wildfire and mudslide events in 2017 and 2018.The utility a subsidiary of Rosemead-based Edison International announced the settlements Jan. 25. SCE said it has now resolved all claims from insurance companies to cover property damage payouts from the 2017-2018 wildfire/mudslide events.



“We have made another significant step toward resolving pending wildfire-related litigation” Pedro Pizarro Edison International’s chief executive said in the announcement.



The $2.2 billion payout to insurers is meant to address carriers’ payouts to policyholders who filed claims over damage from the November 2018 Woolsey Fire which burned about 151 square miles in western Los Angeles County and eastern Ventura County and destroyed more than 1640 homes and other structures. Three people also died as a result of the blaze.



The fire ignited near the former Rocketdyne site in the hills west of Chatsworth on Nov. 8 and burned through portions of Agoura Hills Westlake Village Calabasas and Malibu.



SCE said in the settlement announcement that it will also pay additional amounts for claims arising from future payments that may be made to policyholders up until July 15 2023. SCE and the insurers agreed to a cap for these future claims but did not disclose the amount of that cap.



In settling with the insurers SCE said it did not admit wrongdoing. However in October 2019 SCE admitted in a statement that a circuit problem with its power equipment likely ignited the fire.



The cause of the fire is still under investigation by the California Public Utilities Commission and a separate criminal investigation by the California Attorney General’s Office.



SCE also said that in a separate series of actions it has settled directly with approximately 1000 property owners who sued the utility directly over damage suffered as a result of the Woolsey Fire as well as the December 2017 Thomas and Koenigstein fires and the January 2018 Montecito mudslides that followed those fires.

Again the utility admitted no wrongdoing as part of those settlements.



The Thomas and Koenigstein fires — which had separate ignition points but within hours merged into a single blaze subsequently known as the Thomas Fire — burned nearly 282000 acres in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties and destroyed 1063 structures mostly homes in the cities of Fillmore Ojai Santa Paula Ventura and unincorporated areas in both counties.



In its announcement last week SCE reaffirmed its September 2020 estimate of $4.6 billion in total liabilities from all these fire-related events excluding any fines or penalties that might be levied.



SCE also stated that it had about $700 million left under its own insurance policy that it has been using to cover Woolsey Fire damage claims. “SCE expects that this insurance will be exhausted after expected recoveries for the settlement” the announcement said.



To help cover any remaining settlement amounts parent company Edison International anticipates issuing $1 billion of equity a move the company initially announced in November",,,,,,,,,,,,

John Shumway knows Irvine’s housing market.

As a principal for The Concord Group a national economic research firm he pores over housing data every day.

He’s also an Irvine resident and bought his University Park home more than 30 years ago.

“Irvine has always provided great home values” Shumway says. “In 1976 more than 10000 people showed up to buy the first homes released in Woodbridge. Today Irvine’s new homes are more valuable than those in other cities.”

And he’s right.

Irvine’s long-term value

New data shows that Irvine’s new home values have increased by 93% since 2010 versus 52% across the rest of California. This foretells longer-term values for Irvine homebuyers.

Asked what drives this data Shumway doesn’t miss a beat. “Irvine’s value is about legacy” he says.

“Other master plans tried to replicate Irvine but none can” he says. “They either lack the follow-through or don’t have the location and amenities. Irvine has it all – vision ideal coastal location and the ingredients of a perfectly planned community. Most importantly it has a landowner and a city govern- ment that have been committed to it all for the past 50 years. That’s the legacy.”

As an economist Shumway sees this commitment as driving continual value for homebuyers.

“In my opinion there’s no better place to buy than Irvine” he says. “Market trends change but Irvine won’t. Families have always wanted the best schools and a safe place to live with parks shops and jobs nearby. The demand for the lifestyle Irvine offers will always be strong.”

Perfect for their family

That market strength and lifestyle attracted David and Enid Lim to Irvine from San Diego. They moved to Irvine in 2017 and more recently bought a new home in Eastwood Village.

“Everything is right here” they say while walking in Mosaic Park with their son Adrian. “We’re close to all we need which is what attracted us to Irvine and Eastwood.”

The Lims both work in Irvine’s booming life-sciences industry.

David bikes to his job at a startup med-tech company near The Market Place. Enid works at Edwards Lifesciences just a short drive away.

Nearly every day the couple passes their son Adrian’s future school Eastwood Elementary during walks along landscaped parks and paseos that are steps from their home.

While they enjoy the lifestyle today the Lims also see their new-home purchase as a long-term investment.

“To be honest long-term value was a big reason we chose a new home in Irvine” he says.

“We’re not moving anywhere anytime soon. There’s peace of mind to live in a place that builds such great value over time.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

She was 34.

""Tragically our beautiful Sophie passed away this morning after a terrible accident"" the artist's family said an emailed statement provided by Sophie's representative Ludovica Ludinatrice. ""True to her spirituality she had climbed up to watch the full moon and accidentally slipped and fell. She will always be here with us. The family thank everyone for their love and support and request privacy at this devastating time.""

A police spokesperson in Athens Greece confirmed that Sophie slipped and fell from the balcony of an apartment where she was staying and no foul play was suspected in her death.

The Scotland-born artist was living in Athens when the accident occurred. Born in Glasgow Scotland she began releasing music in 2013. Her debut album ""Oil Of Every Pearl's Un-Insides"" landed her a Grammy nomination in 2018 for Best Dance/Electronic Album.

Sophie collaborated as a producer with a long list of artists including Charli XCX Vince Staples Nicki Minaj and Madonna.

Tributes have poured in from across the LGBTQ community for Sophie who was transgender and widely considered one of the most pioneering artists in the music industry.

Four-time Grammy Award winner Sam Smith tweeted: ""The world has lost an angel. A true visionary and icon of our generation. Your light will continue to inspire so many for generations to come.""

French singer/songwriter Christine and the Queens described Sophie as a “stellar producer a visionary a reference” who rebelled against “the narrow normative society by being an absolute triumph both as an artist and as a woman.”

She added: “We need to honor and respect her memory and legacy. Cherish the pioneers.”

Discussing gender identity in a 2018 interview with Paper magazine Sophie said “Transness is taking control to bring your body more in line with your soul and spirit so the two aren’t fighting against each other and struggling to survive.”

“On this Earth it’s that you can get closer to how you feel your true essence is without the societal pressures of having to fulfill certain traditional roles based on gender” she said.

The artist's visibility was seen as influential according to a statement from her representatives labeling her an ""icon of liberation.""

Last fall Star Wars fans had the ability to vote on which new legacy lightsaber they wanted to see added to the popular Galaxy’s Edge collection. The options included winner Kestis Anakin Skywalker Kanan Jarrus Qui-Gon Jinn Ezra Bridger and Lord Corvax.

We wouldn’t be surprised if this new lightsaber showed up at the Star Wars Trading Post which is moving to a new location at the Downtown Disney District at Disneyland Resort! We’ll report back when we have more information.

More About Cal Kestis

For those unfamiliar with Kestis Wookieepedia has shared the following biographical information

Cal Kestis was a Force-sensitive human male who became a Jedi Knight during the reign of the Galactic Empire. As one of the few Jedi who survived the purge that destroyed the Jedi Order Kestis lived in seclusion for years until a confrontation with the Inquisitorius compelled him to openly resist the Empire’s rule. Hunted across the galaxy by the Empire’s Jedi hunters Kestis embraced his connection to the Force once more having decided to restore the Jedi Order. As the Padawan of Jedi Master Jaro Tapal Kestis served alongside his mentor in the Clone Wars until the Grand Army of the Republic betrayed its Jedi officers after receiving the command to execute Order 66 from Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine. Related: ‘The Mandalorian’: Did R2-D2 Save Grogu from Order 66?

Many fans of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order have wanted to see Kestis appear in a live-action Star Wars series for quite some time. Many have even noted that Cameron Monaghan who portrays Kestis in the game bears a striking resemblance to him in real life.

Although there’s certainly no guarantee it’s possible that Disney and Lucasfilm officials will take the fact that he won the legacy lightsaber contest into consideration moving forward. Before The Mandalorian Season 2 finale episode aired some expected Kestis to show-up to rescue Grogu — in reality one of Star Wars’ most iconic Jedi Knights Luke Skywalker had that honor.

Now some think Kestis could play a role in the upcoming OBI-WAN KENOBI: An Original Series set to feature Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan Kenobi and Hayden Christensen as Darth Vader. Nothing however has been confirmed about even the vague potential for Kestis to appear.

There are potential upcoming Star Wars projects like the rumored Order 66 film that Kestis could fit into from a Star Wars timeline standpoint.

Bedford – Robert Mayer Ellis of Bedford (formerly of Beech Grove and Bloomington) 87 passed away peacefully on January 20 2021. Bob was born on February 20 1933 in Lincoln IL. He was the second son of William Spotswood Ellis II and Mildred Mayer Ellis. Bob was raised in a happy home by his uncle and aunt Hardin and Irma Ellis. Bob married his dream girl Janet Lee Morse on June 10 1956 and Janet survives him.

Bob graduated from Atlanta (IL) High School in 1951 and completed his Bachelor of Science Degree at Oberlin College in 1955. He then entered the U.S. Army serving as a medic from 1955-1958. Upon his discharge Bob began a distinguished career as a biochemist at Eli Lilly and Company in Indianapolis. He toiled tirelessly at Lilly for 35 years retiring in 1993. While at Lilly Bob worked on many high-profile projects including his breakthrough research in developing the first artificial insulin which has led to life-saving treatments for millions of people. Bob was quietly and rightfully proud of the impact his work has had on diabetics around the world over the last 60 years.

Bob was even more proud of his family. He and Janet raised three wonderful daughters who survive him: Ruth Bryant (Mike) of Lee's Summit MO; Lynn Titche (Charlie) of Bedford; and Heather Kostella (Matt) of Verona PA. Dad was extremely honored that his daughters chose science and education as their life pursuits. His constant encouragement and unending support of his children shaped his daughters' lives (and their families') immeasurably. Bob was even more gratified that his girls have carried on his and Mom's Christian values and lifestyle. Dad's devotion to his faith and dedication to service in God's name will affect lives long after his passing. Dad also leaves six grandchildren who have been blessed by his loving ways: Dean Amanda James and Lauren Bryant; and Miles and Isaac Titche.

Amateur inventor lover of animals and nature strategic mower of lawns and snow-plower to all in his neighborhood - Bob never said ""no"" to a friend family member or someone in need. Bob was giving to all caring and quick to help. Emblematic of his love for others was his long kind porch conversation with a complete stranger while Bob was having a heart attack unwilling to leave a down-and-out soul when his own life was in danger. Bob was a long-time member of both Bethany Lutheran Church in Indianapolis and St. Thomas Lutheran Church in Bloomington (IN). His beautiful tenor filled many a chapel with glorious tones.

A celebration of Bob's life will be held at a later date likely at his beloved second home Lutheran Hills. Gifts in remembrance of Bob may be offered to Lutheran Outdoor Ministries (LOMIK) the Parkinson's Foundation or Fellowship Of Christian Athletes.

Dax Shepard and Kristen Bell want to be as honest as possible about their relationship.

While appearing on Sunday Today with Willie Geist Shepard 46 opened up about why he and Bell 40 make a point of talking candidly about their ups and downs.

""We don't want anyone to think we met and it's been easy 'cause if that's someone's expectation of a relationship and certainly a marriage it's a bad expectation to have"" he said.

The couple who tied the knot in 2013 share two children daughters Lincoln 7 and Delta 6.

Shepard went on to joke that in order to get a little more alone time he might tell Bell that his interview with Geist ""went another half hour longer.""

""If Kristen asks I'll say we went long"" Geist added with a laugh.

Bell who has been spending more time with Shepard at home than ever due to the COVID-19 pandemic recently opened up to PEOPLE about the work they put in to keep their marriage strong.

""Dax and I when we started this pandemic were at a point in our marriage where we definitely needed a little therapy brush-up"" the actress shared.

""Every couple of years we're like 'We're being very antagonistic towards each other' and we don't want that"" she added. ""We go back to therapy and figure out what I'm not doing that's best for you and what you're not doing that's best for me and how we can serve this team goal better. It's been incredibly helpful.""

Bell has also credited her husband with encouraging her to open up about her struggles with anxiety and depression.

""My husband was like yeah talk about that. And I realized I had been presenting this like bubbly individual and it just wasn't the full story. It didn't have the dimension"" she said on a December episode of The Backstory podcast.

""I want to be the person who talks honestly and says 'I get what I present to you it's not always the case' "" the Good Place star added. ""So if you're feeling that too just know that I'm right here with you.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5qLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvMDEvbmpzLWhvcnNlc2hvZS1jcmFicy1hcmUtdml0YWwtdG8tdmFjY2luZS1yb2xsb3V0LWEtYmF0dGxlLWZvci10aGVpci1zdXJ2aXZhbC1yYWdlcy1vbi5odG1s0gGJAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5qLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvMDEvbmpzLWhvcnNlc2hvZS1jcmFicy1hcmUtdml0YWwtdG8tdmFjY2luZS1yb2xsb3V0LWEtYmF0dGxlLWZvci10aGVpci1zdXJ2aXZhbC1yYWdlcy1vbi5odG1sP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,N.J.’s horseshoe crabs are vital to vaccine rollout.

Wang served on the Duke faculty for nearly four decades. A native of Fujian Province China and Taiwan he earned his BS in electrical engineering from National Taiwan University and an MS in electrical engineering from the University of New Brunswick (Canada) before completing a PhD from Ohio State University in 1965. He served at Bell Laboratories in Communications Systems Research and Modern Control Theory before joining the Duke ECE faculty in 1968.

He was a prolific and renowned researcher and author in the areas of pattern recognition image processing fuzzy logic mathematics of uncertainty and intelligent machines. A dedicated teacher he mentored generations of undergraduate and graduate students in ECE. Wang also consulted on diverse specialties including advanced fighter planes naval ship navigation energy and highly reliable systems for Duke University Medical Center Emerson Electric Grumman and LORD Corporation amongst others. He was a board member and adviser to ECE-related companies as well as an ASEE-NASA Fellow at Langley Space Research Center.

Wang maintained close ties to the ECE department and Duke University following his retirement in 2005 visiting often to talk with faculty and staff and traveling extensively to inspire universities around the world to enhance their ECE programs. As professor emeritus he also remained active in the scientific community serving as editor of numerous journals including special issues for the Elsevier journal Information Sciences and managing editor of the journal New Mathematics and Natural Computation.

Wang was a kind and generous colleague who will be greatly missed by his many friends in ECE. He will be remembered for his wonderful zest for life—his curiosity about all things his devotion to his family and his great passion for history reading music the arts learning and education. In 2009 Perkins Library exhibited ""Chinese Paintings from the Kingdom of Min"" from Dr. and Mrs. Wang's personal collection. A permanent collection of Dr. and Mrs. Wang's academic and literary donations is housed at Jimei University in Xiamen China.

He is survived by his wife of almost 60 years Julia Wang as well as by son Samuel Wang T’86 P’24 (Barbara) grandson Samuel James Wang E'24 and granddaughter Lucia Wang; son George Wang grandson Carter Wang and granddaughter Leah Wang.

The Duke University flags are being lowered February 1 in memory of Dr. Wang; plans for a memorial service and celebration of his life are forthcoming. The family is establishing a fund in his honor to benefit future Duke Engineering students which will be announced soon.",,,,,,,,,,,,
ENPH,Enphase,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hc2RhcS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvZW5waGFzZS1lbmVyZ3ktc3RvY2stcmFuLXRvby1mYXItdG9vLWZhc3QtaW4tMjAyMC0yMDIxLTAxLTMx0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Enphase Energy Stock Ran Too Far Too Fast in 2020,"2020 was a banner year for leading solar microinverter designer and manufacturer Enphase Energy (NASDAQ: ENPH). Its stock rose 570% more than Zoom Moderna and just about every other growth stock other than Tesla. Enphase is now the largest publicly traded pure-play U.S. solar stock by market capitalization.

Enphase has some impeccable growth prospects and a leading position in a booming industry. But there are a number of reasons why its stock may have ran too far too fast in 2020. Here's why Enphase Energy is a great company but its stock is too expensive right now.

The turnaround

If you were an investor scanning the market for solar stocks in the summer of 2017 you probably wouldn't have noticed the less than $75 million gem that was Enphase Energy. The company that had once been valued at over half a billion dollars and sold for $15 a share was now trading for less than $1 a share. On the brink of bankruptcy and losing market share to rival SolarEdge (NASDAQ: SEDG) Enphase then restructured and went on to have one of the better four-year comebacks on Wall Street. Trading at over $200 a share today you won't find many companies that have produced an over 200-fold return faster than Enphase.

Excellent growth

Enphase's epic surge is due in part to its growth numbers -- which have been impressive. The company doubled revenue between 2018 and 2019. The results aren't out yet but Enphase is guiding for revenue between $245 million and $260 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 which would bring total 2020 revenue to around $762 million (a 22% gain over 2019). Aside from revenue the company is now consistently reporting profitable quarters on a non-GAAP basis growing its operating cash flow and sporting the highest gross margin in its history. At 53% its GAAP gross margin is closer to leading chip manufacturers like NVIDIA or AMD than it is to other solar companies.

Concerning valuation

Just like Enphase's gross margin resembles leading chip manufacturers its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio resembles that of trendy electric vehicle stocks like Tesla and Nio.

Enphase's staggering 38 P/S ratio is about the only chart you need to take a pass on this stock at its current price. It is nearly quadruple the 10.6 P/S ratio of its rival SolarEdge. And it's higher than Nio and Tesla which surged over 1100% and 740% in 2020 respectively.

The P/S ratio is the market capitalization of a stock divided by its revenue. Put another way imagine if you had a coffee shop that earned $100000 a year in revenue and the market valued your business at $3.8 million even though you're barely turning a profit. That's how much the market is valuing Enphase's growth so much so that it's willing to pay a premium price today because it believes in the future of the company.

But it's not just the high P/S ratio on its own that makes Enphase an expensive stock. It's also the fact that Enphase isn't growing revenue at the same pace it did in 2019. Comparing Enphase to other hyper-growth stocks like CrowdStrike or Zoom further outlines Enphase's lofty valuation. Although CrowdStrike and Zoom both have a higher P/S ratio than Enphase (61 and 59 respectively) they are growing revenue much faster than Enphase.

CrowdStrike is expected to double its revenue (again) in Fiscal Year 2021 whereas Zoom's P/S ratio is misleading because it factors in the company's first-half 2020 revenues which are a fraction of what it's earning today.

A league of its own

Enphase has found itself in uncharted territory (literally). Its valuation is multiples higher than that of other leading solar companies. Although it has one of the highest growth rates and gross margins in the sector 2020 revenue is expected to grow by just 22% year over year. 2021 will need to generate much higher revenue growth or Enphase's share price will need to come down before the company is worth considering. And there are other concerns as well. Enphase has picked up its profitability but it technically lost money in the second quarter of 2020. It is also compensating its employees with a fair amount of stock-based compensation which isn't shown in the non-GAAP numbers it tends to quote.

Enphase is a great company but an expensive stock. There are plenty of better solar stocks and wind stocks at more attractive valuations.

Smaller slower and more profitable. These are the watchwords for Chesapeake Energy as it emerges from bankruptcy. Free of the colossal liabilities that sank it as the pandemic slashed global energy demand last year the company has also abandoned the growth-at-all-costs strategy that made it a pioneer of the shale revolution — and poster child of the sector’s debt-fuelled excess.

Chesapeake’s market value will be a fraction of the $35bn it boasted more than a decade ago back when its controversial founder the late Aubrey McClendon was America’s best-paid chief executive and his company poured money into everything from Oklahoma real estate to an NBA arena. The new Chesapeake pledges to spend less than it brings in and return the excess to shareholders.

Outside the US oil and gas industry this wouldn’t sound radical. Within the business it is a departure. The only feature that matched shale’s disruptive rise in the past 15 years — more than doubling US oil and gas production and sharply reducing dependence on foreign oil supplies — was the industry’s unmatched knack for destroying investors’ money as hundreds of billions of dollars were spent with little return. Wall Street reacted by dumping its stocks making the sector one of the S&P 500’s smallest. When the worst oil crash in decades struck last year operators were forced to slash capital expenditure sack tens of thousands of workers idle rigs and cut production. Chesapeake’s Chapter 11 filing was just the most high-profile of scores of bankruptcies.

Now promise shale executives a more resilient industry is emerging from the ashes that aims to woo investors. Like the reincarnated Chesapeake it will be smaller — some analysts believe the sector will be reduced to just 10 dominant shale producers. Production increases will be modest and financed from cash flow. And activity will focus on fewer prolific shale fields mainly in Texas. Oil operators that feared new US president Joe Biden’s ambition to launch a green energy revolution would stymie the industry’s drilling and slow production growth now promise to do both themselves.

“I do believe we have a lot of proving to do to get investors back” says Vicki Hollub head of Occidental Petroleum which 18 months ago racked up $50bn in debt buying a rival producer in a deal now considered one of the most reckless gambles in the shale patch’s short history.

Cash flow and earnings growth must be the new priorities Ms Hollub says. “I believe that the watershed moment is here and our industry will I don’t think ever be the way we have been in the past.”

Can the industry’s new pitch be trusted? Some investors remain sceptical remembering how past promises of capital discipline crumbled when oil prices rose. “Give an oilman a dollar and he’ll drill a well” runs the old industry adage. In an era when environmental concerns are already deterring investment in fossil fuels and long-term growth in oil demand is no longer assured shale executives know they cannot risk breaking more promises.

“Why should investors trust it?” asks Matt Gallagher who headed Parsley Energy a shale producer acquired by larger operator Pioneer Natural Resources last year. “They shouldn’t.”

Early warning signs

After years of growth shale’s cash-intensive business model was running on fumes even before Saudi Arabia’s price war with Russia and the coronavirus pandemic crashed the oil market last year. The sector’s defining feature is the fast decline of each shale well’s production where output can drop by 80 per cent after just a year. To offset the loss another must be drilled. Then another to offset that well’s loss.

“In a shale play if you stop running you will fly off the back of the treadmill” says Raoul LeBlanc vice-president of energy at consultancy IHS Markit and former head of strategic planning at Anadarko Petroleum the company bought by Occidental in 2019. “Just to stay still you’ve got to do a lot of drilling.”

Operators drilled more than 14000 shale wells in 2019 according to Rystad an energy research company. It helped the US hit record-high oil output near 13m barrels a day a level unmatched even by Saudi Arabia and Russia the world’s next biggest producers.

That was a rise from 5m b/d just eight years earlier — a surge that sparked booms from Texas to North Dakota and helped drag the US economy out of the mire of the global financial crisis adding one percentage point to GDP between 2010 and 2015 according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. But it required huge infusions of cash offered at basement interest rates. Rystad says the sector spent around $400bn capital in those years but by 2019 free cash flow arrived only once in 2016.

“The fundamental problem with the shale model over the past decade has been the pursuit of growth over return on capital employed or returning capital to shareholders” says Ben Dell managing partner at Kimmeridge a private equity firm that has built up an activist position in the sector.

Investors that rushed to finance shale’s recovery from the 2014-15 price crash — an earlier Saudi price war to capture market share — were fleeing by 2019. As capital markets began to close for shale companies operators were forced to trim spending plans reducing new drilling activity. With profits still absent and growth prospects diminishing the shale patch entered 2020 in distress.

A reputation for flagrant corporate misgovernance and excess — from colossal executive bonuses earned by hitting oil output growth targets not profits to flashy office developments and rumours of company-funded hunting trips — didn’t help.

Then came last year’s price crash including the symbolic moment in April when West Texas Intermediate the country’s benchmark crude contract traded below zero for the first time. “Covid hits oil prices collapse everyone has to cut their capex valuations crash” says Aaron DeCoste an equity analyst at Boston Partners an institutional investor. “And it’s effectively reset the entire industry.”

Just a few shale companies showed they could survive the collapse last year in relative health says Mr Gallagher. From Chesapeake to scores of smaller producers the distress was acute with more than 100 operators and service providers with $102bn in debt going under according to a Rystad analysis from law firm Haynes and Boone.

“The ones that went wrong went way wrong” Mr Gallagher says. “What’s going on now is people are finding religion about the models that work.”

M&A rush

One tenet of the new shale “religion” is that scale is critical to survival — but of operators not the overall sector. The mergers and acquisitions to achieve adequate size coupled with the consolidation of weakened companies will continue to shrink the number of producers.

Lee Maginniss managing director at Alvarez & Marsal an advisory firm involved in oil industry restructuring says subscale producers will face “intense” pressure. From around 500 exploration and production companies in the US before the crash 50 may survive he says. Other analysts say just 10 or so dominant public shale companies will be left to run the best plays.

M&A activity is brisk with $52bn worth of deals done in the US oil sector last year according to Enverus a data provider. Chevron moved first buying Noble Energy in July. ConocoPhillips bought Concho Resources. Devon Energy merged with WPX Energy. Heavy debt battered balance sheets and weak equity valuations meant that stocks not cash were the currency in each deal.

Pierre Breber Chevron’s chief financial officer expects the consolidation wave to continue. “You need to have bigger players stronger players more disciplined management teams stronger balances sheets” he says. Scott Sheffield Pioneer’s chief executive says only companies with market capitalisation above $10bn will remain attractive to a value-focused investor base.

Scale will also allow them to compete with ExxonMobil and Chevron US majors which have built up commanding shale positions. Between them they intend to produce about 2m b/d from the Permian Basin later this decade — almost a fifth of total current US crude production.

Most of the M&A activity has occurred in that shale oilfield the world’s most prolific where operators will concentrate on the rich layers of oil-bearing rocks in the Delaware and Midland Basins of New Mexico and Texas. Gas-focused players such as the revamped Chesapeake are likely to stick to their best assets. Other shale fields even the Bakken of North Dakota that sparked the shale oil rush a decade ago will lose out.

“The heydays of the Bakken [Texas’s] Eagle Ford [Nebraska’s] Niobrara the Scoop Stack play in Oklahoma are all over” says Mr Sheffield referring to other shale fields in the US.

Capping output

But the main feature of the post-crash shale patch will be an era of tepid growth — if it expands at all. Rick Muncrief chief executive of Devon says his company can now break even at $30 a barrel or less well below the $50-plus for oil in recent weeks. Yet Devon will hold its rig count flat this year only drilling a few wells to meet the lease terms of some acreage.

“From publicly traded companies you’ll see a very measured response” says Mr Muncrief. US oil production is likely to fall by 200000-300000 b/d as a result he believes remaining around 11m b/d — well below the record highs set before last year’s crash.

“Are people going to return to growth? Is US shale going to grow? The answer is no” says Mr Sheffield. “Don’t anticipate a big ramp up in drilling people are not going to go back to the old ways.”

Even if oil prices hit $100 Mr Sheffield says his company would only increase output by 5 per cent a year — less than half the rate of average annual growth in total shale production between 2008 and the beginning of last year.

Analysts say this will be enforced by the market which has punished excessive supply growth — even before the pandemic hit last year — reducing oil and gas’s share of the S&P 500 almost to a footnote.

“The reason why energy is down to 2 per cent of the S&P 500 is because of that behaviour” says Mr Breber. Until the world has fully recovered it will not need shale producers to increase oil supply he says.

So far operators are holding the line. Rystad says third-quarter capital spending by the 39 main shale operators it covers was $3.6bn beneath cash flows from operations allowing a record 89 per cent of operators to balance their budgets. If the discipline sticks dividend- and value-focused investors could be lured back.

“I see attractive fundamentals that I haven’t seen for 20 years” says Mr DeCoste referring to the cheap valuations of some operators juxtaposed with expectations for higher oil prices. But he is cautious about the new capital discipline pledges: “It takes years to build your reputation and moments to destroy it.”

Prisoner’s dilemma

Despite the wave of consolidation other analysts and investors remain unconvinced by shale’s new mantra and more mature outlook saying operators will be unable to resist another supply surge if the recent price rally continues. “Gordon Gekko once said ‘greed is good’” says one adviser to shale operators. “In the oil patch that means ‘growth is good’.”

Chief executives are just “giving the audience what it wants to hear” says Art Berman a consultant and shale sceptic. Forgoing growth is “absolutely antithetical to the DNA of oil companies in general but shale companies in particular”.

Investors will be hesitant to take operators’ pledges on faith alone says Ms Hollub. “It’s going to be a ‘show me’ situation with them.”

Higher prices in recent weeks are already testing operators’ resolve. The weekly horizontal rig count hit 338 in mid-January more than 60 per cent above its low in August. Private operators which account for about 15 per cent of onshore US oil production have led the resurgence taking advantage of falling costs caused by the drop in demand for oilfield services from publicly listed companies.

“We can drill cheaper” says Wil VanLoh head of Quantum Energy Partners a large private equity shale investor referring to his portfolio companies. “By definition private capital is growth capital . . . we out-drill our cash flow until the time we get to positive free cash flow.”

It is the kind of message that public company bosses insisting they will not be drawn into another competitive drilling binge do not want to hear — especially as some analysts project more oil price increases. Goldman Sachs predicts Brent the international benchmark will rise to $65 a barrel by mid-year.

Rystad’s head of shale research Artem Abramov says he expects 2021 to “become the best year for the industry from the perspective of free cash flow generation”. It may even allow for profitability — and new production growth testing operators’ promises to investors.

At an average WTI price of just $52 a barrel this year — around the current price — the shale operators Rystad covers would rake in almost $41bn from operations. After capex commitments debt payments and more than $4bn returned to shareholders they would still have $8bn of net cash in hand. The question is what they do with it.

“I think they lose discipline and they probably bring on too much growth and damage the market again — like they did every year in the past” says Mr LeBlanc. “They’re in a prisoner’s dilemma. They never have discipline as a group because they’re all competing with each other.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5tZS5jb20vbmV3cy9tdXNpYy9saXN0ZW4tdG8tanBlZ21hZmlhcy1uZXctc29uZy1maXgtdXJzZWxmLXNoYXJlcy1kZXRhaWxzLW5ldy1lcC0yODY4NDI40gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,JPEGMAFIA shares new song 'FIX URSELF!' from upcoming EP,"JPEGMAFIA has shared a new song called ‘FIX URSELF’ – you can listen to it below.

To get there they crossed five other borders on a journey that has been filled with loss and trauma.

While she waits Dalianis devotes much of her time stitching floss to fabric creating beautiful embroideries inspired by her faith and the beauty she finds in nature.

""It clears our minds of the negativity we experience in our desperation to cross (the border) and for me it's how I take my mind off things"" she says. ""It's like it takes me to another world.""

Dalianis who asked that we use a pseudonym to identify her is one of around 15-30 asylum seekers in Nogales Sonora participating in Artisans Beyond Borders a program with Tucson roots.

Founded by Tucson resident Valarie Lee James in the summer of 2019 Artisans Beyond Borders connects women (and a few men) with the resources to stitch beautiful pieces of embroidery while they wait in Nogales during the process of applying for asylum in the U.S.

James and her tiny team of volunteers pay the artisans a fair wage for their work and collect and prepare the completed pieces for sale in the U.S. — most recently through the Etsy shop BordandoEsperanza. The Etsy shop has seen an increase in orders for these one-of-a-kind handmade pieces and Artisans Beyond Borders says ""Etsy shop offerings periodically sell out but donating directly to the website guarantees you a hand-picked manta."" There is a minimum donation of $45 to receive a manta.

Over the last year volunteers on both sides of the border have adapted to work within the constraints of the global pandemic using WhatsApp to remain connected with artisans in Nogales.

The volunteers are no longer giving presentations in church halls and back rooms around Tucson to sell and share about the pieces. Instead they are sharing with groups over Zoom and directing participants to the new Etsy shop where they can purchase mantas or servilletas colorful hand-stitched cloths traditionally used for wrapping tortillas and other foods or as a satchel according to Artisans Beyond Borders.

""For me one of the most important things about this project is that we are assisting and being conduits for people practicing their craft and their art under really difficult circumstances"" says Artisans Beyond Borders volunteer Susan Ferrell. ""It's not that we created this thing. They're the creators and we're the facilitators.""

Currently the program is working with asylum seekers originally from Guatemala El Salvador Honduras Nicaragua and Cuba James says. Many asylum seekers have been waiting in Nogales for a year or more under a Trump administration immigration policy that required asylum seekers to wait in Mexico until their immigration hearings. Those hearings have been halted because of the pandemic.

The Department of Homeland Security under President Joe Biden recently announced that it would stop new enrollments in that controversial ""Remain in Mexico"" policy according to NPR.

Embroidery helps as they wait in limbo

Dalianis and her 13-year-old son have been in Nogales living in three different shelters since November 2019 while they wait to proceed with their asylum case. She hopes now that President Biden is in office she'll finally be able to enter the U.S. but still has no indication how long that process could take.

So she turns to her embroidery to take her mind off the uncertainty she feels.

""It keeps me from thinking about the negative things"" she says.

She devotes herself to the art for most of her waking hours usually only taking breaks for meals and to shower. Most days she and a group of eight other asylum seekers living at the shelter embroider together outside before breakfast and after lunch. After dinner Dalianis who learned to embroider as a teenager from her grandmother continues to stitch in her room sometimes until midnight or 1 a.m.

It takes about a week of consistent daily work to complete one manta and she's made about 50 so far.

If an artisan finishes their piece more quickly they'll help another complete theirs Dalianis says.

""That's the good thing about what we have going on here"" she says. ""We help each other out.""

Finding beauty in the desert

The history of Artisans Beyond Borders begins with James taking her dogs for a walk on the outskirts of Amado Arizona where she lived at the time.

""I would stumble across these beautiful bits of color and it would inevitably end up being this gorgeous beautiful heirloom embroidery"" she says. ""They were very mysterious. Where did they come from? Who made these? Why were they carried and why were they left behind? And why didn't anyone care?""

That was way back in 2004. But even today those questions still haunt her. Over the years she and other borderlands residents collected dozens of mantas left behind by migrants crossing through the desert. The designs often celebrate faith and nature.

""We brought them in and we began to take care of them in the way the women who made them would"" James said. ""We washed them and ironed them and hung them and they became this incredible (art) installation.""

Stitching peace

James has worked with asylum seekers for years specifically through Casa Alitas a hospitality center in Tucson run by Catholic Community Services to provide aid to asylum seekers released by Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

A former clinical art therapist James recalls how a basket of embroidery supplies could transform the room.

""Casa Alitas was in a small house at the time ... and I was the de facto arts person as a volunteer."" James says. ""And it was incredible the sense of peace that it would bring to the household. We would sit after dinner and embroider on the couch and the children would just cluster around us and be all relaxed and like 'Que linda. Que hermosa!'"" she recalls. ""It was just like nana sitting on the couch. It helped generate a sense of family.""

They would take embroidery supplies with them when they left the temporary shelter often on cross-country bus rides.

Artisans Beyond Borders volunteer Mary Sheridan recalls volunteering with James at Casa Alitas and watching in amazement as thread and cloth became artwork in the hands of skilled artisans.

""I remember a particular day when somehow there was an unfinished piece of handwork that had a crocheted edge to it and Val and I were looking at each other because we didn't know what to do with this thing"" Sheridan says. ""But she handed it to one of the women who was there and the woman just looked at it nodded and picked up a crochet hook to start working on it to finish it off.""

It was only natural then that in the summer of 2019 when James learned of a request for embroidery and crochet supplies from a shelter on the Mexico side of the border she responded eventually taking other Casa Alitas volunteers with her. On that first trip 14 women immediately began making use of the supplies she says.

""We are really super hands off in terms of guidance and prompts"" she says. ""We want the artisans to do the work that they love whatever brings them a moment's peace ... and that's what's beautiful about these kinds of trauma-informed arts and activities. They're able oftentimes to elicit really beautiful calming memories and generate that sense of peace.""

Many of the women already know how to embroider and if they don't they learn from one another James says.

Dalianis says sometimes books with embroidery designs are brought to the shelter but she prefers to use her imagination for her one-of-a-kind designs.

""I draw whatever comes to mind and I then just start embroidering"" she says.

Her mantas always include phrases expressing her devotion and gratitude to God who she says has helped her through many traumatic experiences.

""I am alive thanks to Him. Lots of things happened to me along the way here. People stole from me a lot all the money I had brought. All of it"" she says. ""They pointed a gun at my husband's forehead and told me to take off my clothes because I had it hiding in my clothes and they left me with nothing.""

On their journey to the border Dalianis' husband died and her son was almost kidnapped. In Nogales she underwent surgery to remove a fibroid and feared she wouldn't survive the procedure.

""Every day when I wake up in the morning the first thing I do is quietly pray to God 'Thank you God for giving me breath for giving me life. Thank you for my son by my side. Thank you for giving me one more day. And for my health'"" she says.

When out on walks Dalianis admires the variety and colors of the butterflies and flowers she has seen in Nogales and those also frequently make their way onto her mantas.

""There are flowers in Cuba but not like the ones here which are even more beautiful. When I walk down the street I look at the flowers and what they're like. I love that the most"" she says. ""In Cuba they are all the same and I'm already familiar with them. I'm slowly getting to know the flowers here and learning their names little by little.""

Aside from being a creative outlet and a source of income embroidery has also helped create friendships among the asylum seekers.

""I feel more about peace whereas before I was very anxious I was afraid to even go out in the street"" Dalianis says. ""But here with the embroiderers I have been able to form friendships. We're not all from Mexico and we spend a lot of time talking about each other's families and traditions.""

Persisting in 2020

Since beginning the project in the summer of 2019 the Artisans Beyond Borders volunteer team has refined their process. They learned that it was best for the volunteers to purchase the manta cloth and cut and serge it before taking it to the artisans. They stopped accepting donations of materials (they would sometimes bleed when washed) and began helping the artisans purchase some of their own supplies in Nogales. They return regularly to exchange pesos for completed pieces.

They work closely with Francisco ""Pancho"" Olachea Martin a well-known nurse/medic in Nogales Sonora who provides free medical care to migrants and asylum seekers several of whom are part of the embroidery project. He helps coordinate the program on the Mexico side of the border including staying connected with the artisans helping with translation and other tasks.

For many of the asylum seekers the money earned from their embroidery is a significant source of income and also helps with their self-esteem Olachea says.

""Remember that these people are not even from Nogales there are some from Cuba Guatemala El Salvador so you can imagine that a little bit of income (can) really help you when you have no home"" Olachea says.

Olachea has been providing medical care for 12 years through his civil association Panchito y su Cristina tending to asylum seekers' physical health.

The embroidery though helps their mental health he says.

Many asylum seekers have experienced trauma not just in their home country but on their journey to the border and embroidery helps give them some peace of mind Olachea says.

""It really helps mentally ... it's a super wonderful thing"" he says. ""It gives them human dignity.""

Prior to the pandemic Olachea made daily rounds in person.

Now he uses Zoom phone calls and WhatsApp to monitor everyone's health and stay connected amid the pandemic.

In the beginning days of 2020 Artisans Beyond Borders was working with around 80 embroiderers or bordadoras.

Although the pandemic temporarily halted the program for about a month they adjusted quickly with help from Olachea who located the artisans who remained in Nogales. The volunteers — many of them older — and artisans began communicating via WhatsApp.

""I keep an eye on the migrants and we all communicate through the phone ... and of course it's not the same but at least they don't feel abandoned they feel very good about it"" Olachea says. ""Considering the circumstances the internet has really saved us all.""

One volunteer has been able to cross the border once a month to exchange manta cloths for completed pieces. Sheridan manages the Etsy shop that has replaced in-person presentations and volunteer Susan Ferrell carefully washes and irons the completed pieces line-drying them in her backyard in midtown Tucson.

""The women were in need"" says Sheridan about the adjustments they made to continue the program during the pandemic. ""And in some sense more need than ever.""

Many of these women and families have now been waiting in Nogales for at least a year the process of applying for asylum delayed in part by the pandemic. They are living in shelters rented rooms and on the street James says.

Kathi Noaker is a volunteer and founding member of Voices from the Border a Patagonia-based nonprofit that helps fund and support Olachea's work of providing medical care and meeting other basic needs for asylum seekers and migrants. She says the length of the time many asylum seekers have been stuck in Nogales has forced them to make a life on the border and try to make ends meet while they wait. Because shelters have limited capacity some rent small cement block rooms with no heating which are much worse than the shelter she says.

""It used to be pretty much a revolving door people would come people would go and we would give them the care that they needed in the moment"" says Noaker. But with so many people stuck in Nogales for much longer than they ever anticipated the non-profit has been helping them long-term with needs like paying for rent food clothing blankets and heaters.

""A lot of people are in desperate need but honestly their attitudes are always pretty amazing they have really strong faith and their faith gets them through"" Noaker says.

Looking forward

Artisans Beyond Borders is housed under the migration ministry at Grace St. Paul's Episcopal Church although it is entirely funded by donations and sales of the artisans' work says James.

""You can look at this through so many lenses — I'm a former clinical art therapist so I see it through a therapeutic healing lens — but ultimately it's really about the grace of God and that's where people feel safe because there's truth there and nobody is trying to exploit anyone and it's all about lifting each other up. That's what we do. We help lift people up.""

James is a Benedictine oblate or a lay person devoted to the Rule of St. Benedict. It is her faith that compels her to offer her skills and resources to help asylum seekers in limbo at the U.S.-Mexico border.

""It is our responsibility as human beings"" she says in an email. ""My faith and what it means to welcome the 'other' go hand in hand.""

Right now the tiny core team of volunteers is looking to add more (especially young) volunteers to their ranks to better serve this community of artisans.

""There is so much creativity and courage that is woven into every stitch"" James says. ""All volunteers everywhere know the real secret is you're the one being changed by volunteering. It's a mutual relationship.""

Dalianis says she loves embroidery so much that she has asked if she can stay involved with the project even after she enters the United States.

""Even if I were to cross tomorrow I would like to keep embroidering because it's still a release for me and also because we're desperate to find work starting in a new unknown country"" she says.

Ranch dressing is a salad dressing and dip usually made from buttermilk salt garlic powder onion powder mustard herbs and spices. This mixture is then typically combined with mayonnaise.

Let's dive into the ""Great American Ranch Divide""

In the third season of ""Man Seeking Woman"" the FXX surrealist romantic comedy Josh Greenberg (Jay Baruchel) prepares to take his girlfriend of several months Lucy (Katie Findlay) to meet his mom and stepfather. Before making the trip out to the Chicago suburbs the couple stops over to see Jay's sister Liz who with the enthusiasm of a seasoned anthropologist explains her parents' mannerisms — from their penchant for clipping out random articles from outdated newspapers to displaying copious holiday-themed decorative towels in the bathroom.

Liz holds out a spoon of something for Lucy to taste. ""It's called 'ranch dressing'"" she explains.

Lucy complies and immediately recoils. ""I did not like that"" she says. ""It's very thick.""

""You just have to pretend"" Liz counters. ""Ranch is central to Mom and Tom's diet. To them it's like liquid gold.""

This episode which was appropriately titled ""Ranch"" and aired in 2017 encapsulates a surprisingly prevalent opinion about the dressing-turned-multipurpose condiment: that it's a passé and kind of cringey thing to order or have on-hand (sort of the culinary parallel to ""Life is Good"" sweatshirts and wooden ""Live Laugh Love"" kitchen signs). This is only further illustrated by ranch's frequent appearances on meme sites like Middle Class Fancy.

And like anything that has come to serve as an emblem of middling suburban tastes ranch dressing has garnered some impassioned detractors who voice their opinions in articles like ""Ranch dressing is what's wrong with America"" — wherein The Washington Post's Ben Adler writes that ""fancy restaurants need to stop experimenting with this revolting milk-rot"" — and Delish's ""7 Reasons You Should Never Eat Ranch Dressing."" In it contributor Maya McDowell summarizes her feelings by writing ""Keep your processed AF globby dressing away from me.""

Ranch: Great or gross? Tell us in the comments below!

Now it should be said that here at Saucy we hate no condiments (borrowing and bastardizing a phrase from the New Testament ""Let all the sauces and dips come to me""). As a '90s baby born in the Chicago suburbs I have vivid memories of when ranch was king of both the snack aisle and the salad bar.

And for many Americans ranch still reigns supreme. According to a 2017 study done by the industry group the Association for Dressings and Sauces 40% of Americans say ranch is their favorite dressing. Italian dressing comes in second with a comparatively meager 10% citing it as their dressing of choice. For some it's superseded mere condiment status as evidenced by the emergence of multiple crocheted Hidden Valley Ranch bottle pillows on Etsy and a shocking amount of ranch dressing tattoos. With that in mind let's dive into the Great Ranch Divide ™.

(Image: Ranch Bottle by Thom G from Black Square Tattoo in Brooklyn/Reddit)

Ranch dressing was originally created by plumber and construction worker Steve Henson who came up with the dressing while working in the Alaskan bush in the 1950s. Since perishable ingredients — like fresh herbs and garlic — were difficult to acquire in that part of the country Henson experimented with dry seasonings like garlic and onion powder dried herbs and powdered pepper. They could be added to mayonnaise and buttermilk for an herbaceous and tangy dressing.

In 1954 Henson and his wife Gayle opened the actual Hidden Valley Ranch a dude ranch in San Marcos Pass in Santa Barbara County Calif. where they hosted guests and eventually opened a steakhouse. Henson's ranch dressing packaged in mayonnaise jars soon became popular souvenirs for guests. Within a few years the couple began packaging the dry seasoning mix in envelopes which could be shipped cross-country to customers who could then add their own buttermilk and mayonnaise at home.

By 1983 shelf-stable ranch arrived on supermarket shelves across the country. Cool Ranch Doritos followed a few years later signaling to snack companies that the tangy allium-heavy bite of the dressing was a welcome addition to foods beyond salads. The global marketing of the chips also cemented ranch as a uniquely American dressing — in countries other than the U.S. Cool Ranch Doritos are known as ""Cool American.""

Thus it's perhaps unsurprising that ranch eventually found a kind of spiritual home in the Midwest. It became a dip for vegetable sticks and chicken wings a dry seasoning for Chex Mix and ""fire crackers"" and perhaps most contentiously an accompaniment to pizza.

It's one of those pairings that feels like a real stoner creation and I say this with affection and without judgement. As Max Balliet — the owner of my favorite local pizza place Pizza Lupo — once texted me ""It's sacrilegious in serious pizza circles.""

""If you need ranch with your pizza you should really think about why the pizza isn't enough"" he wrote when I asked him about his personal views on the combination. ""That said I don't think there's anything wrong with using it so long as you understand it doesn't need it . . . Or if it does need it maybe find better pizza.""

""That being said I don't mind offering it (homemade) because it makes people happy"" he continued. ""It helps us not take things too seriously (even though I obsess over pizza personally) and I'd be a liar if I said I'd never indulged.""

Jason Goldstein the recipe developer for Chop Happy is soundly in the pro-ranch on pizza camp. ""I love ranch dressing on pizza because its sweet and tangy goes amazing with spicy cheesy pepperoni pizza"" he wrote via email. ""Also because dipping anything is fun.""

Meanwhile chef Franklin Becker of Benny Casanova's in Philadelphia has more mixed feelings. ""For me ranch dressing is delicious"" he said. ""But unless it's a Buffalo chicken pizza I don't think it belongs.""

I think this is actually a decent encapsulation of some of unfavorable contemporary reactions to ranch — at least the ones that aren't solely taste-based. Ranch started popping up in places where perhaps it didn't traditionally ""belong"" — take a look at Twisted Ranch in St. Louis with its ""33 proprietary ranch flavors."" And when something is ubiquitous there's bound to be pushback — the view that something popular is also representative of the lowest-common cultural denominator.

But there are a lot of chefs across the country who have recognized that the building blocks of ranch dressing — the cream the acid the spice and the umami — are also the same elements that make an ideal condiment. (I wrote about this late last year when I detailed my love for snack plates as an anecdote for kitchen burnout).

As such there are now cute little bespoke jars of ranch infused with millennial-friendly ingredients like black truffle and extra dill lining the shelves of the supermarket. But if the plethora of Hidden Valley-themed jewelry and accessories on Etsy are an indication many people are just as enthusiastic about the original as Steve Henson's customers.

How should I use ranch dressing at home?

As discussed ranch dressing is as multi-use as you want it to be. In my own kitchen I'm partial to using the dry mix as a seasoning in other things like the base for this play on a buttermilk-brined fried chicken sandwich (inspired by J. Kenji Lopez-Alt's famous Serious Eats recipe).

***

Recipe: Buttermilk (Ranch) Fried Chicken Sandwiches

Makes 4 sandwiches

2 tablespoons paprika

2 tablespoons of cayenne pepper

2 tablespoons of dried ranch seasoning

1 cup buttermilk

1 large egg

1 pound of chicken breasts (4 breasts)

1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour

1⁄2 cup cornstarch

2 tablespoons of salt

1 teaspoon baking powder

4 cups of peanut oil

Sliced lettuce tomato red onion mayonnaise and potato buns for serving

1. In a large bowl stir the paprika cayenne pepper ranch seasoning buttermilk and large egg until fully combined. Add the chicken breasts covering it completely with the buttermilk. Move the entire mixture to a gallon-sized freezer bag and refrigerate overnight.

2. Combine the dry ingredients in a bowl and several tablespoons of the spice mixture from the marinade bag stirring until incorporated. Toss chicken breasts in the flour mixture until a thick coating forms.

3. Heat the peanut oil to 425°F in a large cast-iron chicken fryer or a large wok over medium-high heat. Using tongs tap any excess flour off the chicken breasts and place into the oil frying for about five minutes on each side. Remove from the oil one piece at a time and place on a clean wire rack set on a rimmed baking sheet.

4. Place the sheet into a 350-degree oven and bake for about 10 minutes or until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the breast registers 150 degrees. Remove from oven and place the breasts on a paper-towel-lined plate until slightly cooled.

5. Serve the fried chicken breasts on toasted potato buns with sliced lettuce tomato red onion and a drizzle of mayonnaise. (But feel free to double-down and substitute more buttermilk ranch.)

Quite a bit actually.

Tesla CEO and SpaceX Boss and currently world’s richest man Elon Musk has always been a universal guide and guru on the Internet. Musk who often puts out bizarre things from his Twitter profile has voluntarily or involuntarily managed to influence several products and companies.

Musk who puts out tweets about space science cat gifs anime girls and often what you should support holds a strange leeway with everyone: A single tweet can lead to a never-seen-before surge in prices of holdings and stocks. It’s what the Internet had now coined ‘The Musk Effect.’

Here’s looking at how some of his investments have led to a surge in multiple occasions.

Signal

Musk’s support for the messaging app ‘Signal’ led to users migrating there by such large numbers that the app temporarily crashed. However there may have been mixed signals along the way as investors however mistook it for the stock share of a company called ‘Signal Advance Inc.’ and invested in it. According to Bloomberg by the end of the day Signal Advance Inc. shares had surged more than sixfold. That was enough to push Signal Advance’s rally more than 5100% in three trading days giving it a market valuation of $390 million.

Despite reports about the confusion on Friday the stock has continued to rally. Shares of Texas-based company surged as much as 885% on that day before paring the gains.

Bitcoin

Bitcoin jumped as much as 14% on Friday to a two-week high after Tesla Inc chief Elon Musk tagged the cryptocurrency in his Twitter biography.

Musk simply wrote “#bitcoin” in his biography on the microblogging site.

The cryptocurrency was trading at $37800 as of 0936 GMT.

DogeCoin

Elon Musk has tweeted a digital magazine cover featuring a dog in apparent support of a digital currency Dogecoin. Shares of DogeCoin along with additional push from Reddit recorded a never-seen-before jump.

GameStop

Reddit’s r/WallStreetBets forum grabbed Musk’s attention too when he tweeted “Gamestonk!!” on Tuesday along with a link to the Reddit stock trading discussion group behind the year-to-date 2500%-plus rally in the video game retailer.

CyberPunk

Shares of fast-growing Polish game developer CD Projekt soared 16% on Thursday after Musk tweeted: “The esthetics of Cyberpunk are incredible btw….”. Cyberpunk is the company’s flagship game.

Etsy

Online retailing platform Etsy’s stock jumped 9% on Tuesday right after Musk tweeted: “I kinda love Etsy”. He said he bought a “hand knit wool Marvin the Martian helm” for his dog.

As one of the most popular TV shows in 2021 so far and on Netflix ever Bridgerton brought us relatable characters compelling storylines and well the Duke.

In fact Etsy has seen an increase in searches for ""regency-core"" according to Stylist with things like tea sets and candelabras flying off the virtual shelves. The Bridgerton aesthetic has impressed so much in fact that even Architectural Digest (the gold standard of interiors publications) has dedicated an entire feature to the show's set design.

AD spoke to British production designer Will Hughes-Jones who was responsible the impressive interiors (along with set decorator Gina Cromwell). Hughes-Jones reveals that he was heavily inspired by Sofia Coppola's Marie Antoinette (one of the coolest films of all time if you ask me). “I... studied that film quite religiously as there is so much synergy between the sets and the costumes” he explained.

Antique

Anything 100 years old or older. (You might also see “heirloom” and “period piece.”)

Architectural Salvage

Building components beyond furniture — doors windows mantels etc. — saved from demolition.

Consignment

These shops act as conduits between buyers and sellers and take a cut of each purchase.

Thrift

Gently used items 20 years old and under often — but not always — donated and then sold for charity.

Vintage

Anything approximately 20 years or older. (Brace yourself: The ’80s and ’90s more than qualify.)

The National Weather Service as of Monday morning called for up to 16 inches of snow in New Canaan and the area has been placed under a Winter Storm Warning through Tuesday morning.

“Travel will be very difficult to impossible” the Weather Service said. “The hazardous conditions will impact the morning and evening commutes. Gusty winds could bring down tree branches.”

As of 6 p.m. Eversource reported 831 New Canaan households without power or nearly 10% of customers.

Emergency Management Director Russ Kimes III said in an outcall that “Eversource is aware of these outages and has teams enroute to clear the roads and restore electricity.”

“They have not provided an ETA for power restoration” Kimes said. Three roads are blocked he said: Oenoke Ridge Road at Luke Woods Road Old Norwalk Road and Old Kings Highway and 34 Adams Lane.

Metro-North Railroad posted a bulletin Monday afternoon “advising customers to depart now for home or their final destination.”

“With major snow accumulation and high winds creating increasingly hazardous travel conditions Metro-North will shut down service with the last trains departing Grand Central Terminal at approximately 3 PM” the company said. “The last scheduled arrivals into GCT will be at approximately 4 PM with departures from originating stations shown in the link below.”

The snow was expected to start falling after 7 p.m. Sunday with just two to four inches overnight followed by heavy snowfall all day Monday and into the night.

Winds were expected to gust up to 50 mph the organization said.

Blizzard-like conditions are possible Monday it said especially near the coast.

Eversource said in a press release issued Sunday that the utility company “will have line and tree crews pre-positioned around the state to respond to any damage or outages caused by this storm.”

“Out-of-state crews are being brought in to assist with restoring power and customer care representatives are at the ready to take calls if needed” it said.

(WECT) - After almost a year under some version of stay at home orders we could all use a little extra space.

Bryan Kristof and Gregg Howell saw this need and founded the company Craftspace to create what they call “flex space.”

“People are working and schooling from home. There’s just so much going on that a little extra elbow room might be good. Yea it gives people extra options. Most homes aren’t built for live and work space all in one” said both Kristof and Howell.

The concept is to create an additional space for living in the back yard. They are made from old shipping containers and are fully customizable. They are about 12 feet in size and can cost anywhere from $12000 to $30000 dollars.

They’re hoping to take a unique business idea to address the needs of a unique time.

The Honda Ridgeline defines the term “urban pickup” but it’s no pushover when it comes to tackling rough roads and weighty loads.

It also provides a comfortable cabin for five people clever convenience touches and a rock-solid reputation which are traits that are no less important to truck buyers.

The second-generation Ridgeline that arrived for 2017 (the original dates back to model-year 2006) competes with midsizers from Ford General Motors Nissan and Toyota. Similar entries from Hyundai and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles’ Ram truck division are reportedly on the horizon.

Strictly speaking the Ridgeline is more utility vehicle than pickup. It shares a unitized (frameless) platform with the Honda Pilot and Passport only with an open box instead of an enclosed cargo area.

The Ridgeline’s tailgate swings out from the right or it can be dropped down (it can hold 135 kilograms). PHOTO: HONDA

For 2021 the Alabama-built Ridgeline gets a much bolder grille and a bulging hood. A sizeable trim piece (available in chrome or gloss black) directly below it appears to extend into the headlight lenses. The front bumper juts out which should provide additional protection from minor skirmishes (the rear bumper has also been redesigned).

As before the cargo box has some ingenious features that are in keeping with the Ridgeline’s multipurpose character.The floor is wide enough to accommodate 4x8 sheets of building materials between the wheel wells. There’s also no need for a protective liner due to the bed’s composite-plastic construction.

A lockable storage area beneath the floor contains the spare tire provides added space for stowing bulky valuables such as tools and groceries and can also function as an ice chest. It’s accessible by swinging open the standard “Dual Action” tailgate from the right-hand side or by dropping it down in the traditional manner. When lowered the tailgate can support 135 kilograms.

The Ridgeline can be outfitted with an available Truck Bed Audio System with six weatherproof transducers built into the side walls. They act like speakers by transmitting audio vibrations from inside the cab to those seated or standing outside (ideal for year-’round tailgate gatherings).

For the 2021 model year the Ridgeline is mostly carryover with some updates to the infotainment system. Leather seating is optional. PHOTO: HONDA

Interior changes focus on the 8.0-inch touch-screen that receives new icons and a physical volume-control knob which might seem like a small thing but is important for keeping your eyes on the road instead of the screen.

The Ridgeline’s fold-up rear-seat cushion allows you to load everything from potted plants to bicycles to giant-screen TVs. Speaking of loads the Ridgeline is capable of 680 kilograms of cargo and it can tow up to 2270 kilograms.

The 280-horsepower 3.5-litre V-6 carries over linked to a nine-speed automatic transmission. Fuel economy is rated at 12.6 l/100 km in the city 10.0 on the highway and 11.1 combined.

All-wheel-drive is standard with all Ridgeline trims. The system sends 70 per cent of the engine’s torque to the rear wheels and can direct 100 per cent of that amount to either one depending on driving conditions. There are also selectable Mud Sand Snow and Pavement traction-mode settings.

The base Ridgeline Sport is priced at an estimated $44500 in Canada including destination charges. It comes with the usual comfort gear plus an assortment of dynamic-safety tech including forward-collision alert lane-departure warning and adaptive cruise control.

The remaining three models — EX-L Black Edition and Touring — offer a wealth of extras. The latter two are further maxed out with a seven-speaker 540-watt audio system leather-trimmed interior front and rear parking sensors and blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert.

A new Honda Performance Development appearance package adds a more aggressive-looking blacked out grille fender flares bronze wheels and HPD graphics. The package is available on all trims. There is no added off-road functionality however.

Considering its do-just-about-anything mission calling the Honda Ridgeline the automotive equivalent of a Swiss Army Knife is certainly fitting. Styling updates gives the 2021 version a much-needed shot of character especially in a world where the tough-truck look is currently in vogue.

Honda Ridgeline provides a comfortable cabin for five people clever convenience touches and a rock-solid reputation.

Type: All-wheel-drive midsize four-door pickup

Engine (h.p.): 3.5-litre SOHC V-6 (280)

Market position:The Ridgeline continues its fun and flexible ways but deft character-changing alterations could allow it to snag some traditional pickup buyers who don’t need the capability the bulk and power of a full-size truck.

“There was a technical issue regarding a seal on the gas compressor on Liza Destiny” ExxonMobil’s Guyana office said on Friday adding that “this unfortunate incident resulted in us having to temporarily increase our flare above pilot levels in order to maintain safe operations.”

The company had agreed with local authorities that gas flaring would be kept at a limit of 15 million cubic feet per day. The company did not immediately say by how much flaring has increased or whether it has decreased production so as to limit the amount of gas it would need to flare.

Last year the company faced similar problems with the compressor not being able to reinject all of the natural gas produced alongside the light sweet Liza crude. It had then decided to reduce its production levels so as to reduce the amount of gas it would need to flare.

Flaring is a major environmental concern as it generates harmful greenhouses gases which are responsible for changes in the world’s climate.

“We are disappointed that this unexpected issue has occurred and we’re working diligently with the vessel’s owner and the equipment vendor to understand and fix the issue as quickly as possible” Alistair Routledge President of ExxonMobil Guyana stated.

The company said the relevant government authorities have been informed and it is providing regular updates.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vZXh4b24tY2hldnJvbi1kaXNjdXNzZWQtbWVyZ2luZy1pbi10aGUtZWFybHktZGF5cy1vZi1wYW5kZW1pYy0yMDIxLTHSAWhodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuY29tL2V4eG9uLWNoZXZyb24tZGlzY3Vzc2VkLW1lcmdpbmctaW4tdGhlLWVhcmx5LWRheXMtb2YtcGFuZGVtaWMtMjAyMS0xP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Exxon and Chevron discussed merging in the early days of the pandemic,"By clicking “Sign Up” you accept our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy .

Chevron has also been hammered by the decline in demand for crude oil. Late last year the second-largest US oil producer took steps to reduce costs and streamline operations. It also asked employees worldwide to reapply for positions Reuters reported. Last week the company reported a fourth quarter loss.

The CEOs of Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. spoke last year about combining the two U.S.-based oil giants the Wall Street Journal reported Jan. 31 citing unnamed sources.

Chevron CEO Mike Wirth and Exxon Mobil CEO Darren Woods spoke shortly after the coronavirus pandemic took hold according to people familiar with the talks. The discussions were described as “preliminary and aren’t ongoing but could come back in the future” the Wall Street Journal report said.

The talks were serious enough for legal documents involving certain aspects of the merger discussions to be drafted one of the sources said according to the report. The reason the talks ended was not disclosed.

UPDATE:

Analysts: Chevron Merger Buzz a Sideshow Before Exxon Mobil Loss

If true the combination would form the world’s second largest oil company by market cap and production second in both measures to Saudi Aramco. The Wall Street Journal reported the combined company’s market value toping $350 billion and production of about 7 million bbl/d of oil and gas based on pre-pandemic levels.

Additionally a deal between Exxon Mobil and Chevron would reunite the two largest descendants of John D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil monopoly.

One of the sources in the report said that the CEOs of Exxon Mobil and Chevron envisioned achieving synergies through massive cost cuts to help weather the downturn in energy markets. At the end of 2019 Exxon Mobil employed about 75000 people and Chevron roughly 48000.

Last year Chevron went on to acquire U.S.-based independent oil producer Noble Energy in a $5 billion all-stock deal that was completed in October.

On Jan. 29 Chevron reported a surprise $11 million fourth-quarter loss as low margins on fuel acquisition costs and foreign currency effects overwhelmed improved drilling results.

He's also not enamored of the trend for contests and TV shows about the chase for investments. He doubts that the founders of Minnesota's biggest companies such as Best Buy's Richard Schulze or UnitedHealth's Richard Burke would have won any of them.

""There was nothing unique about their ideas"" Rao said. ""Their genius was in their strategy and skills to execute their strategy. And they just happened to build some of Minnesota's greatest companies.""

Rao notes that the founders of Google Apple and Microsoft avoided or were refused venture capital for years. They waited until they were large and powerful enough to control their own destiny.

Minnesota has had some VC-fueled winners over the last 20 years. However most were purchased by other companies before they became the $1 billion revenue-and-market value ""unicorns"" such as United Health Medtronic and Best Buy that Rao contends is the spine of a strong economy.

Rao an engineer and Ph.D. in finance taught at Harvard the University of Minnesota and most recently at Florida International University. He worked 20-plus years in venture finance and economic development in Milwaukee.

In 2009 Rao wrote ""Bootstrap to Billions."" Last year: ""Finance Secrets of Billion-Dollar Entrepreneurs."" In it Rao interviewed and analyzed the work and skills of Burke Schulze Medtronic founder Earl Bakken Fastenal founder Bob Kierlin and others.

""These are the unicorn billion-dollar entrepreneurs … who [bootstrap-and-borrowed] from startup to more than $1 billion in sales and valuation … among the world's most successful entrepreneurs"" he said.

Rao criticizes the motivation for VCs to gain disproportionate control and wealth for themselves and their investors which leads them to drive companies to go public or sell to bigger firms.

And he explains the business-finance strategies that kept the successful founders in control; from friendly individual investors to various forms of debt finance partnerships and capital-conservation strategies.

Rao said VCs fail to make money on eight of 10 ventures. So they need big success from the other two something like 300%-plus returns to produce aggregate returns that surpass what investors can make in the stock market.

VCs generally invest after a startup company's potential is evident he said. Entrepreneurs need to stay independent longer in search of greater long-term results downstream. That can be tough to do when VCs and investment bankers are dangling millions your way.

Jeff Hinck managing director of Rally Ventures which has offices in the Twin Cities and Silicon Valley presents the counterargument. He said last year's 42% jump in VC investment in the state is great news for entrepreneurs of all stripes.

""VC-backed companies have been a driver of startup activity and job growth in Minnesota for decades"" he said. ""Current and former Rally Ventures portfolio companies such as Compellent SportsEngine Total Expert and others have created thousands of net new jobs in Minnesota. Former employees have created thousands more via new startups.

""There are also a number of current $1 billion-plus [market value] VC-backed companies headquartered here. Jamf Protolabs SPS Commerce and Sezzle to name a few. And companies that are sold generate executives and employees who know what it takes for a business to succeed. They pass on knowledge which creates a more successful startup and economic ecosystem.""

A local venture capitalist recently praised the University of Minnesota-sponsored Minnesota Cup sweepstakes that is the largest pitch competition in the country.

The U's business school since 2006 helped launch 165-plus startups which have attracted $1.15 billion in capital. Seven went public since 2017.

Rao is watching. A grateful immigrant Rao said he is an admirer of Mahatma Gandhi the nonviolent father of Indian independence 70 years ago.

""The only reason [I'm] here and doing well is because of Gandhi"" said Rao. ""Independent India focused on education and developing its youth with world-class institutions.""

Rao's book is a finalist for the Eric Hoffer Award a prestigious competition named after the American philosopher for books published by academic and independent presses. Rao has aided our economy and sparked healthy debate.

Instagram user @creationsross thought it would be cool to play a prank on his FedEx delivery driver (or any visitors really) with a sign that would probably go unnoticed by most people.

While the sign was probably meant to get laughs one FedEx delivery driver took it very seriously.

Usually these videos are of FedEx delivery workers throwing packages or exhibiting some other less than satisfactory behavior in the eye of the homeowners who publish them airing their grievances on social platforms.

This guy respected the homeowners wishes to stay ON the grass cleaning sidewalks and pathways to stay true to his request. You can see the delightful shock on the face of the homeowner as he revels the sign to those watching his ""prank"" video.

(WWNY) - A crash in Adams Center trapped one person in a vehicle late Sunday morning.

The collision happened around 11:45 AM at the corner of Fuller and Minkler Roads.

Chief of the Adams Center Fire Department Travis VanKoughnett says it appears that a FedEx truck heading east on Minlker Road failed to stop at a stop sign when it collided with a Chevy Trax a small SUV with one person inside. The FedEx truck came to rest on top of the SUV.

First responders pulled a woman from the vehicle she was then airlifted to Upstate Medical Center with unknown injuries.

The driver of the FedEx truck was taken to Samaritan Medical Center in Watertown. The extent of his injuries are also unknown.

“We believe that the driver of the passenger car obviously is in a little bit worse of condition than the driver of the FedEx truck” said VanKoughnett.

“Just heard a loud bang. And I turned around and I saw black smoke flying up in the air. Young girl was trapped in the car she was conscious” said Joe Panetta who heard the crash happen.

The area of Minkler Road where the crash happened was shut down for a few hours while crews worked to remove the vehicles and clean the wreckage.

Ever wondered how PGA Tour pros set their goals during the offseason? Getty Images

I’ve worked with more than 100 Tour players and I’d estimate that 80 percent have highly specific mapped-out goals for each season. To my mind this gives them a competitive advantage versus loosely held aspirations like “I’d like to keep my card” or “I want to play in the majors.” My work with PGA Tour professionals on goal setting usually happens between seasons — which is where a lot of amateurs are right now.

Little-known fact: Tour pros have their own private behind-the-curtain stat site that offers a granular look at performance. The players I coach often ask me to take a deep dive there and find areas they can shave a quarter of a stroke here and there off their scoring average. It doesn’t sound like much but a shot a day for the right player could be worth $1 million or more a year.

Pros are highly tuned to their weaknesses and outspoken too but they also have emotional blind spots and biases like everyone else. My first job is to comb through the data and identify specific areas where improvement will make the biggest difference something where my experience comes in very handy; it also helps me make my case when needed. Typically over a couple of hours and a beer or two we hammer out goals and a plan for the upcoming season. The first step in making something better is making it important.

Not surprisingly many of these goals are statistics-oriented which is nice because they’re both specific and quantifiable. A player might be elite putting from inside five feet but mediocre from five to eight feet. As a coach you always ask yourself “Is the problem arising from technique from ineffective training or from both?”

Once that’s assessed I’ll design training to grow that piece. This often includes three to four skill-development practice games for the player to do each week the results of which they record in a journal or text to me. Accountability is critical to any plan.

Here’s a full recent goal-setting example from a PGA Tour player who shall remain nameless:

In big-picture terms he wanted to get back in the winner’s circle and reach the Tour Championship at East Lake after a considerable absence. To those ends the stats offered two clear opportunities for appreciable gains. First cut down the double bogeys. The goal became to reduce his scoring average by 1.2 shots per round — which would vault him into the Tour’s top 10 in Scoring Average — and almost a full shot of that could come by eliminating the big numbers he was making once or twice a tournament. The player his caddie and I spent significant time detailing what smart targets look like in different situations based on his shot history and how aggressive to be on par 5 second shots things that have sometimes tripped him up.

The second area of easy potential gains: Drive the ball more effectively. Adding 10 yards off the tee statistically gains a player a half a shot per day. The specific goal became to finish the year in the top 25 in Driving Distance and top 50 in Total Driving. This player already works hard in the gym with his trainer; the path to success involved both a setup and swing change as well as simple intent from the player himself. To date his driving average has increased 12 yards year-over-year and

the goals we set are paying off big-time.

I don’t want the player overthinking during a tournament so we check progress during off weeks. This isn’t all just math. Beyond the numbers themselves does the player feel like the training is helping or hurting? What pitfalls is he running up against? It’s a fluid process. The goals stay solid but the path to reaching them evolves because we’re human.

Speaking of which: While many goals are stats-based and results-specific others are emotional like how the player feels when he plays. Here’s a goal we set that people might find surprising: “Master my process.” The player felt he was elite at getting ready for a shot when putting and very poor at it everywhere else. Another was “Play with peace and joy.” Part of that is staying emotionally neutral after a bad shot rather than reacting to it. That’s easy to say and really hard to do.

These human emotional goals might sound squishy but they’re extremely important. Without improving on the immeasurable goals you can’t improve on the measurable ones. My player can’t get better in Strokes Gained Around the Green without fixing his inconsistent and poorly run process.

Even though the human goals aren’t purely quantifiable we do measure them by attaching a subjective score after each shot. For example after a lob over a bunker the player will rate his process on a scale of 1 to 5 with 1 being something like “I was thinking about screwing up” and 5 being confident undistracted focus on the task. We assess our progress through a debriefing session after each tournament sometimes with the caddie too and accumulate the results over the course of the season. I’ve done this long enough to know that if the plan is good and we all work together and stick to it the season is likely to end with the player reaching most of the goals we have laid out.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vYW1hem9uLXdhbG1hcnQtbWFpbC1pbi1jb3ZpZC0xOS10ZXN0aW5nLWtpdHMtY29tcGFyZWQtMjAyMS0x0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9hbWF6b24td2FsbWFydC1tYWlsLWluLWNvdmlkLTE5LXRlc3Rpbmcta2l0cy1jb21wYXJlZC0yMDIxLTE_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazon and Walmart mail-in COVID-19 testing kits compared,"Walmart and Amazon are selling mail-in COVID-19 test kits by MyLab Box and DxTerity respectively.

I tried both tests and found that Amazon's DxTerity kit was better than Walmart's MyLab Box.

The DxTerity kit was superior for two reasons: faster result turnaround time and clearer instructions

During a time of virus misinformation and a spiking number of COVID-19 cases testing accessibility is paramount.

Studies have shown that widespread COVID-19 testing is vital to slowing down the coronavirus pandemic. But depending on the time of year and where you live accessing these tests may be difficult and lines could end up being hours long.

As a result the at-home COVID-19 testing kit market is becoming saturated and many big-name retailers like Amazon and Walmart are now starting to sell these kits as well.

I decided to try the mail-in COVID-19 tests that are now being offered through Walmart and Amazon and found that the testing kit being sold by Amazon was superior for several reasons.

On December 3 Walmart said it would begin offering MyLab Box's mail-in COVID-19 tests. One month later Amazon announced it would do the same with DxTerity's COVID-19 testing kit. Both kits have been authorized by the Food and Drug Administration under its Emergency Use Authorization.

I decided to try both tests. See what the experience was like:

The type of tests and the price

DxTerity and MyLabBox's mail-in COVID-19 testing kit. Brittany Chang/Insider

I ordered Amazon's DxTerity and Walmart's MyLab Box COVID-19 test saliva collection kits. Walmart also carries MyLab Box's nasal swab kit and both the saliva and nasal swabs kits can be ordered with standard or express shipping. In the interest of pricing and testing consistency I ordered the MyLabBox saliva kit with standard shipping.

The price made me wince. Both cost me $118.53 which is hefty compared to the free testing clinics near me. While you're obviously paying for convenience it would be hard for anyone who doesn't live a financially cushioned life to take these at-home tests frequently.

I ordered my Amazon and Walmart kits on the same day and created my MyLab Box account the day after with a code I had received from Walmart.

You won't need to use either of the e-commerce platforms after placing your order: DxTerity and MyLab Box both handle the shipment and processing of their respective kits.

Amazon's DxTerity kit arrived on my doorstep before Walmart's MyLab Box. After receiving the packages I registered both kits on their respective websites so I could later view my COVID-19 test results.

Both MyLab Box and DxTerity test-takers can register their kit using the ID code found on the saliva collection tube. Luckily setting up the accounts only took a few minutes.

If you've never taken an at-home COVID-19 saliva test before the process is simple. To boil it down all you have to do is spit into a test tube and mail the tube back to its lab by dropping it off at a FedEx drop box. MyLab Box samples can also be delivered to a UPS depot.

Walmart's MyLab Box can provide results within 48 hours after the lab receives the sample while Amazon's DxTerity results are ready within 72 hours.

MyLab Box's coronavirus test is accurate for people who have COVID-19 symptoms according to the FDA letter authorizing its use. While I had feared exposure on my airplane ride and had a mild sore throat while ordering the tests I didn't have any additional symptoms when I was taking the test.

While DxTerity is also accurate it might miss some COVID-19 cases in people who are asymptomatic according to documents the maker filed with FDA. This is common in other COVID-19 tests as well and is why experts say receiving a negative test alone might not be enough for those looking to travel or visit family members.

Walmart's testing kit: MyLab Box. A surprising struggle.

MyLab Box's mail-in COVID-19 testing kit. Brittany Chang/Insider

Both MyLab Box and DxTerity's testing instructions state that test-takers shouldn't eat drink or smoke anything 30 minutes before taking the saliva sample. As a morning coffee consumer taking two COVID-19 tests at 7 a.m. I found this protocol a bit hard to adhere to but I'm obviously just complaining about the small things now.

The MyLab Box came with:

instructions

a lab requisition form that asks for your personal information

a mailing return label

a test tube for my saliva sample

a biohazard specimen collection bag with a small presumably absorbent sheet inside

a small box to put my test tube in

a UPS bag used to mail my sample to the lab

There was also a small sheet inside the UPS bag but I assumed this was also another absorbent sheet.

After reading the instructions and filling in the lab requisition form I opened up the test tube to begin the sample collection process.

Taking the saliva sample is easy: all you have to do is spit into the test tube until you hit the fill line. Luckily the tube came with a helpful little funnel to prevent a spit spray from missing the tube (you're welcome for that imagery). I then capped the funnel lid — which released a stabilizing solution into my sample— replaced the funnel top with the provided cap and shook the tube for five seconds as per the instructions.

MyLab Box's mail-in COVID-19 testing kit Brittany Chang/Insider

This is where it gets confusing.

The instructions say to place the test tube in the biohazard collection bag seal the bag up put the bag in the box place the absorbent sheet on top and then close the box.

However the graphic next to these instructions showed something different. Here the specimen bag and test tube look like they're about to be placed on top of some bubble wrap inside the box and the absorbent sheet looks like it's near the UPS bag but not about to be placed inside the box.

Bubble wrap? I never received bubble wrap in my package.

The instructions also didn't mention what to do with the second sheet. Was the smaller sheet found inside the specimen collection bag supposed to stay inside the bag? Or was that the sheet that was supposed to be placed on top of the bag inside of the closed box? And if the latter is the case what do I do with the larger sheet that came inside the UPS bag?

Confused I ended up placing the smaller sheet on top of the specimen bag and inside the box while leaving the larger sheet inside the UPS bag. This felt wrong but the instructions weren't clear enough to guide me in the right direction.

I slid the closed box — filled with the smaller absorbent sheet and the collection bag with my spit-filled test tube — into the UPS bag along with the larger sheet and sealed the package closed.

I was paranoid I had messed up the test but decided to move forward.

Amazon's testing kit: DxTerity. Pleasantly straightforward.

DxTerity's mail-in COVID-19 testing kit. Brittany Chang/Insider

Now onto Amazon's DxTerity kit.

The kit came with:

instructions

a test tube

a specimen collection plastic bag with a small white absorbent sheet

Saliva collection with DxTerity's kit is also straightforward: just spit into the test tube until your saliva reaches the thin sqiggly line. Like MyLab Box's test DxTerity's test tube also came with a handy funnel.

And yes after spitting into two test tubes I was parched.

As per the instructions after my spit reached the line I replaced the funnel with a ""fluid cap"" which released the blue ""viral RNA inactivation and stabilization solution"" into my collection of saliva.

Afterward I tightened the cap shook the tube for five seconds and dropped it into the specimen bag. This time the instructions told its test takers to keep the absorbent sheet inside the bag.

Unlike the MyLab Box kit the DxTerity saliva sample can be sent to the lab directly in the box that it came in. No need for a new label or a separate UPS bag. All I had to do was put the test tube inside the sample bag place the sample bag inside the box seal the box and then send the box full of my spit off.

Drop off was easy — I live near several FedEx drop boxes

Comparing the mail-in COVID-19 testing kits sold on Amazon and Walmart. Brittany Chang/Insider

With my two packages ready to go I looked up the closest FedEx drop boxes near me. Luckily finding a drop box was pretty easy and I was able to send my packages off in the morning well before the box's collection time. Time to say goodbye to my test kits and hello to my water bottle.

Results

Comparing the mail-in COVID-19 testing kits sold on Amazon and Walmart. Brittany Chang/Insider

Results from in-person testing sites near me will often come back within 48 hours. I didn't get this same perk with either of my mail-in tests.

However one test result came back much faster than the other.

I completed and dropped off both tests on January 19 and received an email from DxTerity on January 21 notifying me of my COVID-19 results. Delighted by the quick results I logged onto my DxTerity profile and was relieved to see ""negative."" According to my result paperwork my collection's accession date was on January 20 hence the fast turnaround time.

However MyLab Box which had already caused me some grief during the testing process was not as quick. Walmart states that the kit can provide results within 24 to 48 hours after the lab has received the sample but this was not the case.

Seven days after mailing in my test I finally received an email from MyLab Box on January 26 notifying me of my COVID-19 test result. But when I clicked on my negative results to read the report I was confused. The document said my test was collected on January 9 and reported on January 22. It also stated that my testing report was generated on January 29.

When asked about the result turnaround time MyLab Box's customer service manager told Insider in an email that the majority of its tests have a 24 to 48 hour result turnaround time but on ""rare occasions"" this may differ due to shipping delays and demand spikes.

""We are all living in unprecedented times which pose many unexpected challenges to delivery services health facilities and our staff alike"" the email read. ""We pride ourselves on our rapid turnaround time in fact it is a key performance metric we hold ourselves accountable to both internally and our valued partners nationwide.""

And in regards to the test result report the company says the dates are ""mainly intended for internal monitoring and some reporting purposes.""

At this time all labs are required to report both positive and negative COVID-19 test results to help the department of health track and manage the pandemic"" the email continued.""

My final verdict: Amazon's DxTerity is the winner

DxTerity's mail-in COVID-19 testing kit. Brittany Chang/Insider

After taking both tests I can confidently say that I prefer Amazon's DxTerity test over Walmart's MyLab Box due to DxTerity's straightforward instructions and result turnaround time.

At-home coronavirus tests offer convenience that can't be found by going to a clinic in-person. For starters the testing kit is mailed to your doorstep which means you don't have to walk or drive to a nearby testing facility. And if you're in a rush to get a test but can't book a time slot or can't wait in line mail-in kits may be your next best option.

However given the price of these two kits I would rather go to a testing facility than order another mail-in test."

Because I had read this thread in October when the electricians arrived midway through my install I asked them about the power blaster. Their initial pull sheet did not include a power blaster. I told them (and my installation advisor) that monitoring was very important to me and asked if they could include a power blaster for me. There was an unrelated problem with the initial pull sheet so the electricians had to return a second day with the correct parts. On the second electrical install day they brought and installed a power blaster for me. I can't be sure how much my request and/or the fact that the electricians had to return another day anyway factored into the end result of getting a power blaster.



I'm very thankful for the info others have posted here since I would not have known anything about this otherwise!



The head electrician mentioned that Tesla was phasing out the power blasters and moving to a different solution. He did not reveal anything more specific than that so it still isn't clear to me whether my power blaster was accidentally or purposefully omitted.

Renewables generated more electricity than fossil fuels in Europe for the first time last year.

Fossil fuel-powered energy fell to 37 per cent whereas renewable sources rose to 38 per cent in 2020 according to a report published today. This means clean energy has overtaken sources like gas and coal in the EU.

“It is significant that Europe has reached this landmark moment at the start of a decade of global climate action” explains Dave Jones senior electricity analyst at UK thinktank Ember and lead author of the report.

“Europe is relying on wind and solar to ensure not only coal is phased out by 2030 but also to phase out gas generation replace closing nuclear power plants and to meet rising electricity demand from electric cars heat pumps and electrolysers.”

Denmark had the highest share of wind and solar at 61 per cent followed by Ireland (35 per cent) Germany (33 per cent) and Spain (29 per cent). Overall Europe’s electricity was 29 per cent cleaner in 2020 than it was in 2015.

While this is a promising start the report says that the increase in renewables is still too slow to reach new 2030 climate targets. The EU has pledged to reduce emissions by more than half in the next decade.

The increase in renewables is still too slow to reach new 2030 climate targets.

“The European Green Deal – our response to the climate crisis – requires some 100 TWh of annual additions of renewables a doubling of the deployment speed seen in 2020” says Patrick Graichen director of German energy thinktank Agora Energiewend.

“Post-pandemic recovery programmes thus need to go hand-in-hand with accelerated climate action.”

Boosted by wind and solar

The rise of renewables has been significantly boosted by the increased use of wind and solar energy. The two together generated a fifth of Europe’s electricity last year.

Coal dropped by a fifth in 2020 and has halved since 2015. Gas which the chief of the European Investment Bank recently declared ""over"" only fell by four per cent.

The news comes after solar was named the “cheapest electricity in history” by the International Energy Agency (IEA) in October. The technology is now less expensive than coal and gas in most major countries.

The intergovernmental organisation warned however that it was too early to say that fossil fuels had peaked.

“The era of global oil demand growth will come to an end in the next decade” states Dr Fatih Birol IEA executive director. “But without a large shift in government policies there is no sign of a rapid decline.”

He adds that a global economic recovery after the pandemic could push the demand for fossil fuels back to where it was before COVID-19 causing emissions to rise once again.

“Governments have the capacity and the responsibility to take decisive actions to accelerate clean energy transitions and put the world on a path to reaching our climate goals including net-zero emissions.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdyZWVuY2FycmVwb3J0cy5jb20vbmV3cy8xMTMxMDk2X3Z3LW1lYi1iYXNlZC1zb2xhci1lbGVjdHJpYy1jYXRhbWFyYW4taXMtZm9yLW1pbGxpb25haXJlcy1ub3QtbWlsbGlvbnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,VW MEB-based solar-electric catamaran is for millionaires not millions,"Volkswagen has been pushing its MEB-based electric vehicles as being for millions not millionaires. But the tagline appears not to apply to other companies that use its MEB for their own projects—like an electric catamaran.

VW is supplying MEB components to Silent Yachts which specializes in solar-electric boats. The company launched its first yacht in 2009 according to a VW press release.

Silent Yachts' catamarans use solar power for propulsion and all onboard equipment with a backup diesel generator according to VW. The Silent 55 catamaran is capable of sailing almost 100 miles per day on solar power alone the automaker said.

In addition to using MEB components Silent Yachts partnered with Cupra—the performance arm of VW's Spanish Seat brand—on the design of a new catamaran model.

VW has suggested that it aims to offer the MEB platform up to other makers. It produced the ID Buggy concept to illustrate some of that potential but the partnership with Silent Yachts shows the automaker wasn't just thinking of land-based vehicles.

No other automotive clients have emerged so far. Fisker was in negotiations for the use of the MEB platform for its Ocean electric crossover but Fisker ended up signing with Magna for contract production instead.

Meanwhile the ID.4 crossover is the first MEB vehicle in the United States. Scheduled to hit dealerships in a few weeks it's aimed at mainstream gasoline crossovers like the Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4 and will be built locally at VW's Chattanooga Tennessee factory beginning in 2022.

The ID.4 will be followed by an all-electric revival of the classic VW Microbus based on the ID.Buzz concept first shown in 2017. That model is expected to arrive in the U.S. in 2023. It was originally expected to launch here in 2022 but delays in production preparation forced VW to push that back.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vaW50ZXJlc3RpbmdlbmdpbmVlcmluZy5jb20vdHJhbnNwb3J0YXRpb24vc2hhcmphaC11bnZlaWxzLXVhZXMtZmlyc3QtZXZlci1lbGVjdHJpYy1za3ktcG9kLW5ldHdvcmvSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sharjah Unveils UAE's First Ever Electric Sky Pod Network,"And since the pods are aerial the surrounding land can also be used for green open spaces or the development of retail and residential real estate. “We don’t need to build roads or demolish houses like when developing other infrastructure so we can bring this transport system very close to people’s homes” said in a statement Oleg Zaretskiy SkyWay Green Tech’s chief executive.

Since 2015 FirstEnergy and a law firm that represents it have contributed $31500 to campaign accounts Kelley oversees records show.

In an interview he stressed that he has not been influenced by the contributions many of which he received before the scandal of House Bill 6 hit Cleveland’s doorstep.

“The question is this: Did I act inappropriately? The answer is clearly no” Kelley said. “You cannot find any vote that was influenced by a contribution especially in this case.”

Kelley said he plans to donate $6000 in contributions linked to FirstEnergy to an environmental nonprofit. The move comes as the utility studies “how it engages in the political process to ensure alignment with our corporate values behaviors and strategies” according to a company spokeswoman.

An FBI affidavit filed last summer says FirstEnergy and its affiliates paid $60 million in bribes to former Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder and his allies involving House Bill 6 the billion-dollar legislative bailout of two nuclear plants once owned by a FirstEnergy subsidiary.

In recent weeks Kelley has sought to subpoena records involving Consumers Against Deceptive Fees a group that sought to undercut Cleveland Public Power one of FirstEnergy’s chief competitors in Northeast Ohio. Consumers Against Deceptive Fees received $200000 in FirstEnergy money in 2019. Tax filings show the funds were first sent through a nonprofit Partners for Progress which is at the heart of the Statehouse investigation.

On Thursday Mayor Frank Jackson acknowledged that the city is contemplating legal action against FirstEnergy for its campaign against CPP.

Dark money in Cleveland

Kelley has said repeatedly that he wants to determine whether more money from the House Bill 6 scandal has been used in Cleveland. The money to Consumers Against Deceptive Fees was funneled through nonprofits which do not need to disclose their donors.

The cash that flows through those organizations is referred to as dark money which is far different than the campaign contributions given to candidates’ political committees. Those funds are a matter of public record.

Kelley became City Council’s president in 2014. With it he obtained control of the Council Leadership Fund a campaign fund that helps bankroll the campaigns of many Council members and other state and local candidates.

During his time as Council president the fund delivered thousands of dollars to the Cuyahoga County Democratic Party. Kelley also had hundreds of dollars donated to other causes.

Since 2015 FirstEnergy’s political action committee contributed $17500 to the Council Leadership Fund. Roetzel & Andress a law firm that represents FirstEnergy gave $9000 during that time according to campaign finance reports.

One of the contributions from the law firm for $500 in 2018 carried the name of Jennifer Varhola. She was a principal in Consumers Against Deceptive Fees tax filings show. She was listed as a legal assistant at the law firm.

FirstEnergy also contributed $2500 to Kelley’s personal campaign account Friends of Kevin Kelley. No other member of City Council received any funds from the Akron utility since 2015. Roetzel & Andress gave Kelley’s personal campaign account $2500.

Kelley said Roetzel & Andress like many major law firms in the city contributes to candidates and the Council Leadership Fund. The firms have many interests in city government that extend beyond one or two issues.

Kelley said his donations to an environmental group would include $1000 from his personal campaign fund and $5000 from the Council Leadership Fund. He said the contributions were given after Consumers Against Deceptive Fees formed in 2018.

Jackson the city’s mayor received $7000 from FirstEnergy and more than $9000 from Roetzel & Andress since 2015. Jackson’s campaign treasurer Scott Finerman said FirstEnergy’s political action committee did not give the mayor any contributions in the last election year 2017.

“If such funds were offered they would not have been accepted” Finerman said. He said the earlier contributions from the company “were received properly were spent properly were reported properly and the current intent is not to refund or donate.”

Donating contributions

Since FBI agents arrested Householder and his allies in July some state legislators have returned FirstEnergy contributions to the utility.

“No one wants to be associated with FirstEnergy right now” said Catherine Turcer the executive director of Common Cause Ohio a government watchdog group.

“Transparency leads to accountability. It’s not enough for public officials to divest themselves of FirstEnergy contributions. Legislators need to take steps right now to enable the public to ‘follow the money’ and shine a spotlight on FirstEnergy and others so that we aren’t taken advantage of again.”

Jennifer Young a spokeswoman for FirstEnergy said candidates returned eight checks from the utility’s political action committee. She said none of those candidates were involved in local races.

Young said the returned checks represent a small percentage of the checks issued last year. She said FirstEnergy has “paused political contributions while we evaluate our participation in the political process.”

Some state legislators have donated contributions from FirstEnergy to charity. George Lang a Senate Republican from Southwest Ohio gave $5000 to a youth organization. Michael Sheehy a House Democrat from near Toledo sent $2000 to an organization that helps feed and clothe the poor.

“I just wanted to dissociate myself from [FirstEnergy]” Sheehy said.

Jessica Thomas the chief administrative officer for Roetzel & Andress did not return an email seeking comment. She has said in the past that the firm does not comment on current or former clients.

Opposing FirstEnergy

Kelley who is considering a run for mayor this year said he has opposed FirstEnergy in other issues before Cleveland City Council.

In 2017 Council rejected an effort by TPI Efficiency to provide electric aggregation services to about 60000 homeowners and businesses in the city who were not customers of CPP.

Westlake businessman Tony George served as agent for TPI one of four companies that sought the contract.

The company awarded the contract would receive no money from the city but would gain permission to buy electricity in bulk and at a discount. It would then sell the power to those Cleveland customers who chose the aggregation services.

If TPI would have received the contract it would have used a FirstEnergy affiliate as the supplier of electricity city records show.

Kelley and Council following the recommendation of the city administration chose another company Northeast Ohio Public Energy Council.

George then helped finance the collection of signatures for an initiative drive to reduce the number of Council members from 17 to nine. The group later withdrew its petitions.

George has contributed to Kelley and other members of Council. He and his family gave Kelley $4000 total in 2016 and 2017. He said it would be wrong to take the contributions to Kelley out of context: “Are you kidding me? There are hundreds of people who contribute. I have contributed to members of Cleveland City Council for 30 years as well as other candidates.”

The Browns ranked 21st in total defense this past season and 16th in total yards allowed according to pro-football-reference.com. These statistics were good for third out of four teams in the AFC North.

The Browns’ defense was certainly hurt by COVID-19 this year as both Myles Garrett and Denzel Ward missed games as a result of catching the illness. With an offseason that should be devoted almost exclusively to the defensive side of the ball the Browns have the tools to greatly improve their defense heading into next year.

The strength of the Browns’ defensive unit this year was their defensive line as Garrett Olivier Vernon and Sheldon Richardson led the way in both sacks and quarterback hits. However the Browns will most likely need to find a replacement for Vernon who is a free agent this offseason and is coming off of a torn Achilles tendon which he suffered in the last game of the regular season. Finding another pass rusher opposite Garrett will be one of the positions the Browns will need to address.

The back seven of the Cleveland defense is where the Browns need to make some significant upgrades in order to improve their chances for next season. Despite B.J. Goodson looking like a keeper at linebacker the Browns would be smart to look to add another game changer at that position. The Browns struggled mightily at covering the middle of the field as opposing tight ends feasted against Cleveland linebackers. Adding a linebacker that can cover tight ends in space would help take the Browns’ defense to the next level.

Cleveland’s defensive backfield was the weakness of their team this year as both cornerbacks and safeties dealt with various coverage issues at many points. Denzel Ward missed four games due to injury and COVID-19 and Greedy Williams did not play at all this year with a nerve issue in his shoulder. Additionally second round draft pick Grant Delpit missed the entire season after rupturing his Achilles tendon in training camp. This forced veteran Andrew Sendejo into the starting lineup a player who struggled mightily in coverage over the course of the season. The Browns will be in need of another starting caliber cornerback as starters from this past year Terrance Mitchell and Kevin Johnson are both free agents.

The Cleveland defense shows promise with building blocks Garrett and Ward leading the way. In a division that has been historically ruled by defense the Browns will have to add a combination of free agents and draft picks in order to improve on their rankings from this past year as a unit. While the Browns do not pick until the 26th spot in the first round of the upcoming NFL Draft they should still be able to add a defensive starter whether it be another pass rusher a linebacker or a cornerback.",,,,,,,,,

A cold start. Stretches of inspired play. But ultimately disappointment.

The Golden Eagles recovered from a 15-point halftime deficit Sunday but couldn't get over the hump in a 75-73 loss to St. John's at Fiserv Forum.

As the calendar turns to February and good college basketball teams are polishing their NCAA Tournament resumes MU (8-9 4-7 Big East) is free-falling in the conference standings with three straight losses.

Just like recent defeats to DePaul and Providence the Golden Eagles suffered through a frigid start against the Red Storm (11-7 5-6).

There were plenty of missed shots: MU was 1 for 9 on three-pointers in the first 20 minutes.

There were also head-scratching miscues: Right before halftime the Golden Eagles let St. John's score six points in eight seconds. First they allowed Red Storm star Julian Champagnie to knock down a three-pointer with 15 seconds remaining then MU junior guard Greg Elliott casually tossed an inbound pass that was intercepted by Posh Alexander. The St. John's freshman guard converted a three-point play and the Red Storm went into the locker room with a 46-31 advantage.

BOX SCORE: St. John's 75 Marquette 73

MU came out for the second half like a completely different team. The Golden Eagles scored on nine straight trips down the court and drew even at 51-51 on a three-pointer from senior forward Jamal Cain with 14:46 remaining.

That head-spinning inconsistency has been the only consistent thing about MU this season.

""Our guys battled like crazy in the second half"" MU head coach Steve Wojciechowski said. ""In the first half I thought St. John's brought the fight to us. There's no question about that.

""We responded to it. But in Big East games you can't dig yourself the hole that we did.""

It didn't help that the Golden Eagles were without freshman forward Justin Lewis who hurt his ankle in practice Saturday.

""The timetable is unsure"" Wojciechowski said. ""Ankle injuries are tricky so we don't know how long he will be out. But certainly we hope he's back sooner rather than later.""

Lewis who is averaging 8.6 points and 5.6 rebounds per game is MU's most important player off the bench. Without him the perilously thin Golden Eagles didn't get a single point from their reserves. Elliott sophomore guard Symir Torrence and freshman guard Dexter Akanno combined to take just one shot.

Looking like it was losing steam after the comeback MU let St. John's take control again at 63-53 with 10 minutes remaining.

But the Golden Eagles didn't fade away thanks to tough inside play from senior center Theo John (16 points and eight rebounds) and freshman forward Dawson Garcia (20 points and nine rebounds). Sophomore guard D.J. Carton also started attacking after a lackluster first half scoring 10 of his 12 points after halftime.

""We definitely want to get the ball to Theo or Dawson or Justin when he's healthy"" Wojciechowski said. ""And play off those guys. I thought Theo and Dawson did a really good job tonight.""

MU just could never grab the lead. After Cain threw down an alley-oop to bring MU within 69-68 with 3:08 on the clock MU senior guard Koby McEwen missed a jumper and Carton had the ball poked away by Alexander for a layup. The Red Storm's pesky point guard finished with six steals.

The Golden Eagles still had chances in the final seconds. Garcia tipped in a rebound to cut the deficit to 75-73 with 12 seconds on the clock then Champagnie was whistled for traveling after receiving the inbound pass.

McEwen couldn't convert on a tough layup with 3 seconds remaining but St. John's tipped the ball out of bounds. MU had enough time for a quick shot but Carton's inbound pass was stolen.

""Obviously I wish we would have had another timeout in that situation which we didn't"" Wojciechowski said. ""But we have to be able to pass and catch from out-of-bounds to inbounds and we didn't do that on that last possession.""

The Explorer is the company’s flagship product with 6126 units sold in the country last year.In 2021 Ford will be releasing three more SUVs -- the Expedition the Lincoln Navigator and the Bronco.“Our strength is our heritage of capability and in SUVs and pickups there’s not another brand that does that as well in my opinion” said Jeffrey who was appointed to lead the Korean unit in March last year.“And we are going to show that off through our products and their capability and get as many people in to experience (them).”The Bronco expected to land here around the end of this year is an exciting new addition that has been completely renewed since it was last offered 25 years ago the chief said. Unveiled globally in July the classic SUV is expected to take the off-road segment by storm having racked up 190000 preorders in the US.“In our internal meetings Jim Farley said that there have to be products that people cannot live without and Bronco would be a classic example for that for now” Jeffrey said quoting the chief executive of the Ford Motor Company.“People are just lining up to get the vehicle because they feel like (owning the car) is such an expression of who they are and (the car is) so capable that they have to have it.”As for pickup trucks Ford will push the boundaries to lead growth of the segment here.The company will be introducing two such vehicles the Ranger Raptor and the Ranger Wildtrak whose size and capabilities best suit local market needs the Australian chief said.Jeffrey who prior to coming here worked at Ford’s branches in Shanghai and in Chennai India described Korea as a “mature” automotive market with discerning consumers.“Local companies have driven a lot of innovation and expectation in customers” he said in reference to the dominant local brands Hyundai and Kia. “There is still room for development but it is much more mature than India and China where I have been.”He also pointed out that the luxury segment is much larger than in other markets he has experienced giving the example of Mercedes-Benz a German automaker that holds twice the market share here as it does in the US.On the development of electric vehicles and autonomous driving technology Jeffrey reiterated the company’s proposition to invest $11.5 billion in electric vehicles and $1 billion in self-driving cars.“We have started with plug-in hybrid electric vehicles in Korea in 2020 we have had great reception to that and we will continue to grow with that and bring Ford EVs when the market’s ready for it” Jeffrey said.Ford Korea released the plug-in hybrid electric vehicle versions of the Lincoln Aviator and the Ford Explorer in 2020.With the number of models set to increase by 20 percent the director expressed a positive outlook for this year’s sales.A large part of his career has been focused on the customer experience Jeffrey said and his goal is to earn the respect and trust of customers.“I love to see us as American vehicle of choice over time we can own the right or claim that spot” Jeffrey said.“That doesn’t happen overnight but we are very successful in other parts of the world and no reason we cannot be more successful than we are here.”By Jo He-rim ( herim@heraldcorp.com,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvbmVpbHdpbnRvbi8yMDIxLzAxLzMxL2VsZWN0cmljLWNhci1jaGFyZ2luZy1hcy1mYXN0LWFzLWdhc29saW5lLWlzLXRoZS1haW0tYnV0LWJhcnJpZXJzLXJlbWFpbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Electric Car Charging As Fast As Gasoline Is The Aim But Barriers Remain,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/neilwinton/2021/01/31/electric-car-charging-as-fast-as-gasoline-is-the-aim-but-barriers-remain/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvbmVpbHdpbnRvbi8yMDIxLzAxLzMxL2VsZWN0cmljLWNhci1jaGFyZ2luZy1hcy1mYXN0LWFzLWdhc29saW5lLWlzLXRoZS1haW0tYnV0LWJhcnJpZXJzLXJlbWFpbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vam91cm5hbC5jbGFzc2ljY2Fycy5jb20vMjAyMS8wMS8zMS90ZWVucy1hbmQtY2Fycy1zcGVlZC10aHJpbGxzLWJ1dC1hbHNvLWtpbGxzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Teens and cars: Speed provides thrills but it also kills,"Other than the collector car auction and car show calendars there seems to be no rhyme nor reason to the flow of news releases into my inbox. But I was struck recently by the back-to-back arrival of two such items.

The first was from Ford and was titled “As Traffic Deaths Spike During COVID-19 New Report Examines Unsettling Trend of Teen Drivers Speeding — and Dying — on America’s Roads.”

The news release reported that Ford and the Governors Highway Safety Association have done a study of traffic fatalities from 2015 to 2019 and discovered that teen drivers were disproportionately involved in crashes resulting in speeding-related deaths.

While 30 percent of vehicle deaths of those 20 years of age or older are related to speeding speeding underlies 43 percent of teenagers’ traffic deaths.

And it’s not only speeding teenage drivers who are dying or being hospitalized. It’s also their passengers.

I’m the grandfather of three teenage drivers one of whom only recently received his learner’s permit. As a father I also taught three teenagers how to drive. Yes I care and so should everyone who ever ventures out beyond the end of their own driveways or apartment parking lots.

Three bullet points to ponder:

* “The report Teens and Speeding: Breaking the Deadly Cycle is the first look in recent years at the role speeding plays in teen driver deaths and… sheds new light on what we know about speeding-related fatal crashes involving teens – the driver is more likely to be male have run off the road or rolled the vehicle and be unbuckled.”

“While the report includes data through 2019 the new analysis of teen driving deaths is timely as overall traffic crashes have spiked during the COVID-19 pandemic and speeding on less-crowded than normal roadways is cited by states as a major factor in the surge in motor vehicle deaths. Parents may also have less time to spend training their teen drivers given other priorities during the pandemic.”

Excuse me! How can properly preparing your child for engaging in driving and his or her safety and that of others they encounter on the roads not be a priority?

“The GHSA report also notes the risk of a teen driver being involved in a speeding-related fatal crash rises exponentially (my emphasis) with each additional passenger in the vehicle. This is a worrying situation as more teens eager to see their friends may drive around together as COVID-19 vaccines become more readily available.”

From what I’ve observed during this period of “distance learning” teens are even more eager than before to jump into a car together to enjoy time with friends they aren’t seeing in person during the school day.

And speaking of schools haven’t they all pretty much abandoned driver-training classes?

The news release quotes the governors safety group executive director Jonathan Adkins: “Our country has a speeding problem that has only worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic. Thousands of people die needlessly on our roads because some drivers mistakenly think less traffic means they can speed and nothing bad will happen. The data tell us that teen drivers are the most likely to be tempted to speed so the need to address this issue is more critical than ever given traffic death trends during the pandemic.”

“Teens don’t see speeding as a serious problem and parents likely don’t recognize how rampant it is for novice drivers” adds Ford’s Jim Graham “so teaching them about the impact is critical.”

The governors’ safety group points out ways parents can “help rein in speeding teens as well as re-evaluate their own driving behaviors.”

There are programs such as Ford’s Driving Skills for Life driving instruction classes as well as other teenage driving-safety classes. But there is another that seems to me a no-brainer — the teenager’s smartphone which is often seen as a detriment to safe driving and an object that detracts their attention from the road ahead.

There are apps such as Life360 that enable parents not only to know where their teen may be at any given time but how fast that teen is traveling whether the teen is driving the car or simply riding along.

As a followup to the study the governors’ safety group and Ford plan an hour-long webinar on teens and speeding on February 4. As they say about some television programs parental attention is advised.

Yes automotive enthusiasts this is a major issue that not only deserves but demands our attention. Not only do we love our cars and driving them but even more so we love our teenage children and grandchildren and even our neighbors’ children and grandchildren and their neighbors and…

And this issue is so important that I’m going to save that other news release to share another time. In the meantime I urge you to have a talk with your teen."

From traveling the world to showing us how to style Hermes and Chanel Jaime Xie definitely knows a thing or two about luxury

Cybersecurity is a default part of our internet browsing experience. From firewalls to VPN it's the obvious requirement to ensure your sensitive information stays safe on the internet and we often equip ourselves with the same. So it comes as no real surprise that Ken Xie the founder behind cybersecurity firm Fortinet is a billionaire. Xie established his company in 2000 with his brother and currently has a net worth of $3.5B.

Recently there's another Xie family member who has been making the headlines. His 23-year-old daughter Jaime Xie who was recently featured on Netflix's 'Bling Empire'. The show's synopsis states: ""While their days and nights are filled with fabulous parties and expensive shopping sprees don't let the glitz and glamour fool you. Between running multi-billion dollar businesses and traveling the world these friends are as good at keeping secrets as they are at spilling them. And there is certainly no shortage of secrets.""

Xie's stunning fashion looks and YouTube hauls have caught everyone's attention. Which has us wondering what is her net worth? Read more to find out.

She had a pretty normal childhood

Contrary to popular belief Xie's childhood was not all glitz and glamour. Having grown up in Silicon Valley Xie had a very normal childhood. She spent most of her time focused on school and horseriding seeing that she used to do so competitively. In fact Xie is quite the rider. She ranked number one in the nation in the United States Equestrian Federation (USEF) Small Junior Hunter 16-17 Division.

Xie is a luxury fashion influencer

One look at the socialite's Instagram page and you'll know that she has quite an eclectic taste when it comes to fashion. Even on the show her looks are nothing short of iconic. Turns out she has been a regular at European Fashion weeks for a while now she enjoys curating and putting looks together. To her fashion is about being able to wear art. Her YouTube channel is quite popular with only five videos till date. She already has over 67000 followers after all it gives her fans access to her stunning designer wardrobe.

In an interview with Vogue UK Xie spoke about her personal style and how it evolved into what it currently is. “I don't have a specific style. It's just whatever catches my eye and holds my interest. Originality is what keeps things exciting for me and I’m drawn to clothes that are different from anything I’ve seen before or might already have in my closet"" she said.

What is her current net worth?

From unboxing Chanel necklaces to showing off her Amina Muaddi pumps Xie is known to love luxury. In fact she has a pretty sizeable net worth — a whopping $50M. Seeing that she is currently a fashion and luxury influencer and now a reality TV star this figure will probably increase from here on. After all we're pretty sure Gucci and Hermes shopping hauls don't come cheap.

The stock restrictions were put in place as the mobile brokerage app confronted high trading volume over the past week. The high volatility was spurred by a speculative investing discussion forum on Reddit called WallStreetBets. The group of Reddit users banded together to buy up GameStop's call options causing the struggling retailer's shares to soar to unprecedented levels and hurting market short-sellers. The group then proceeded to target other heavily-shorted stocks.

Robinhood co-founder Vladimir Tenev said in a Twitter thread on Thursday that as a brokerage firm the company has many financial requirements including ""SEC net capital obligations and clearinghouse deposits"" which fluctuate based on market volatility and exist to ""protect investors and the markets.""

""It was not because we wanted to stop people from buying these stocks"" Robinhood added in a blog post. ""We did this because the required amount we had to deposit with the clearinghouse was so large—with individual volatile securities accounting for hundreds of millions of dollars in deposit requirements—that we had to take steps to limit buying in those volatile securities to ensure we could comfortably meet our requirements.""

The Securities and Exchange Commission said on Friday that it is monitoring developments and will “act to protect retail investors when the facts demonstrate abusive or manipulative trading activity that is prohibited by the federal securities laws.” In addition New York Attorney General Leticia James said she would launch her own review into the market activity.

The move has also prompted two separate lawsuits against the investing platform. The first lawsuit filed in the Southern District Court of New York alleges that Robinhood ""purposefully willingly and knowingly"" restricted certain securities transactions including GameStop. The other filed in the Northern District Court of Illinois alleges that the app manipulated its platform.

In addition Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has floated the possibility of an investigation into the matter by the House Financial Services Committee which has received bipartisan support from other lawmakers like Sen. Ted Cruz R-Texas and Congressman Ro Khanna D-Calif. as well as business leaders like Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Ocasio-Cortez added that the inquiry should ""not be solely limited to Robinhood.""

Other competitors who previously restricted securities include TD Ameritrade Charles Schwabb WeBull E*TRADE and Interactive Brokers.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer D-N.Y. said in a tweet Sunday evening that any SEC and Congressional investigations of decisions to restrict access to trade GameStop ""must happen ASAP.""

The stock restrictions were put in place as the mobile brokerage app confronted high trading volume over the past week. The high volatility was spurred by a speculative investing discussion forum on Reddit called WallStreetBets. The group of Reddit users banded together to buy up GameStop's call options causing the struggling retailer's shares to soar to unprecedented levels and hurting market short-sellers. The group then proceeded to target other heavily-shorted stocks.

Robinhood co-founder Vladimir Tenev said in a Twitter thread on Thursday that as a brokerage firm the company has many financial requirements including ""SEC net capital obligations and clearinghouse deposits"" which fluctuate based on market volatility and exist to ""protect investors and the markets.""

""It was not because we wanted to stop people from buying these stocks"" Robinhood added in a blog post. ""We did this because the required amount we had to deposit with the clearinghouse was so large—with individual volatile securities accounting for hundreds of millions of dollars in deposit requirements—that we had to take steps to limit buying in those volatile securities to ensure we could comfortably meet our requirements.""

The Securities and Exchange Commission said on Friday that it is monitoring developments and will “act to protect retail investors when the facts demonstrate abusive or manipulative trading activity that is prohibited by the federal securities laws.” In addition New York Attorney General Leticia James said she would launch her own review into the market activity.

The move has also prompted two separate lawsuits against the investing platform. The first lawsuit filed in the Southern District Court of New York alleges that Robinhood ""purposefully willingly and knowingly"" restricted certain securities transactions including GameStop. The other filed in the Northern District Court of Illinois alleges that the app manipulated its platform.

In addition Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has floated the possibility of an investigation into the matter by the House Financial Services Committee which has received bipartisan support from other lawmakers like Sen. Ted Cruz R-Texas and Congressman Ro Khanna D-Calif. as well as business leaders like Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Ocasio-Cortez added that the inquiry should ""not be solely limited to Robinhood.""

Other competitors who previously restricted securities include TD Ameritrade Charles Schwabb WeBull E*TRADE and Interactive Brokers.

Online shoe brand Allbirds opened a store in Philadelphia in 2020 and plans to more than double its store count next year hoping to reach shoppers who want to touch and try on its wool shoes. Read more

In the mass of athletic to street sneakers the nondescript gray trainers at first glance could be regarded as utilitarian and entirely forgettable.

The muted shoes belied the vibrant story of business partners Joey Zwillinger and Tim Brown who started their successful sustainable apparel company Allbirds in 2014 four years after Zwillinger graduated from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and two years after Brown a professional soccer player in his native New Zealand retired from the sport.

Last fall with visions of broadening its product line beyond shoes and a limited assortment of clothes Allbirds secured $100 million in Series E funding backed by the investment firm Franklin Templeton. And in the years before that it had captured the attention of Silicon Valley’s techies and counted Leonardo DiCaprio and Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz among its investors.

As business continued to grow for the company best known for its sleek minimally embellished trainers made from merino wool that originally sold only online Allbirds brought its first store to 2090 square feet at 1709 Walnut St. in Philadelphia during the middle of the pandemic last year and hired 14 employees.

And this year as droves of retailers have trimmed offerings at their brick-and-mortar locations or closed them altogether Allbirds plans to expand its retail presence by adding to its list of 23 stores that span Auckland New Zealand to San Diego.

“In terms of why we chose to come to Philly we already had a significant e-commerce customer base in the Philadelphia area and felt that there would be healthy demand for an in-person shopping experience” said Travis Boyce Allbirds’ head of global retail operations. “The Center City area has a great mix of shops and is a destination for a wide array of consumers so it immediately came to mind as the perfect location for our first store in the city.”

Boyce did not elaborate on Allbirds’ plans for expansion.

As brick-and-mortar shopping flailed much of last year — with Philadelphia’s highbrow shopping district on Chestnut and Walnut Streets no exception — five retailers managed to open anyway. In addition to Allbirds Atmos Interior Define Kate Spade New York Outlet and Kevin O’Brien Studio introduced themselves to Center City in 2020 and Rolex is expected in March according to the Center City District which focuses on economic development in the city’s downtown.

Boyce declined to provide sales figures for the company which is not publicly listed though investors bought a stake for $1.4 billion in 2018 according to the Wall Street Journal.

Allbirds’ presence on Walnut Street adds to the mix of national retailers in Center City which totaled 255 in 2020 out of 1001 according to the Center City District. That constituted around 34% of the retailers in the city’s prime downtown shopping area with the remainder being made up of independent or local stores. The majority of the retailers — 225 of them — focus on selling apparel with the next-largest group — 138 retailers — selling jewelry and watches.

“It was well underway prior to [COVID]” Steven Gartner executive vice president of global retail services for CBRE said of Allbirds’ opening in Philadelphia. “But it’s certainly a great indication for both Walnut [Street] Philadelphia in general and the growing strength of the Allbirds brand. They could have just as easily delayed or canceled opening but they did not.”

Part of the strength of Allbirds and what has netted its loyalists who range from Bay Area tech entrepreneurs to DiCaprio to New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy is what it starkly refuses to be: flashy impractical or garishly imprinted with logos.

It touts environmental sustainability as one of its main selling points. It says its merino wool is ethically sourced sneaker midsoles are made from carbon-negative Brazilian sugarcane and shoelaces spun from recycled plastic bottles.

“During the pandemic we’re seeing that our sustainable commitments are just as if not even more important to shoppers than ever” Boyce said. “It’s a testament that people care about brand mission and want to put their purchasing power to good use. They want to do something that’s better for the world.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5iaXRjb2luLmNvbS9nb2xkbWFuLWFuZC1pbnRlcmFjdGl2ZS1icm9rZXJzLWV4ZWNzLWNsYWltLXdhbGxzdHJlZXRiZXRzLXRyZW5kLWNvdWxkLXRha2UtZG93bi10aGUtc3lzdGVtL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Goldman and Interactive Brokers Execs Claim Wallstreetbets Trend Could 'Take Down the System' – Finance Bitcoin ...,,,,,,,,,,

Federal Debt Has Only Exploded Since,"This year marks the 50th anniversary of the end of the gold standard in the U.S. In August 1971 President Richard Nixon formally unpegged the U.S. dollar from gold meaning the greenback was no longer convertible into bullion. Overnight the dollar became a free-floating currency measurable only by comparing it to other world currencies.

And yet there were still restrictions on private ownership of gold coins bars and the like. It wouldn’t be until President Gerald Ford signed a bill in December 1974 that Americans could freely buy and trade bullion for the first time in over 40 years.

A lot happened as a result. Its price no longer fixed gold exploded 385% from the end of 1974 to 1980 when the metal topped out at $850 an ounce as the U.S. coped with historic levels of inflation.

Over the past 50 years gold has expanded more than 46 times with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of about 8%.

The ability to trade gold freely has obviously been good for investors. Today gold bullion is one of the most liquid assets in the world its daily volume standing at more than $145 billion according to the World Gold Council (WGC). Only the S&P 500 and U.S. Treasuries trade more—but not by much.

The Age of Runaway Debt

The drawback is that in the years since the end of the gold standard there’s been a significant and growing lack of discipline when it comes to government spending. Before 1971 there was a natural limit to how much money could be printed. New issuances were dependent on the amount of gold sitting in the nation’s coffers.

Today with the dollar backed not by a hard asset but by the “full faith and credit” of the U.S. government the federal debt is closing in on an astronomical $28 trillion which is more than 130% of the size of the U.S. economy.

To give you some idea of how dramatically times have changed federal debt in 1960 was only a little over half the size of the economy.

The debt is expected to surge even more in the coming months now that Joe Biden has been sworn in as president and Congressional control has shifted in the Democrats’ favor. Biden who turned 78 in November has called for a $1.9 trillion economic relief package that include $1400 checks for all American adults.

I’m not advocating that we return to the gold standard. It’s probably no longer feasible. According to the Treasury Department official gold reserves currently stand at approximately 261 million ounces for a market value of some $493 billion.

That’s just not enough metal to support an economy as large as the U.S.—not unless the price of each ounce of gold was fixed at something outrageous like $100000.

There’s been some discussion of making Bitcoin a reserve currency. Like gold its supply is limited and it has the potential to scale up. But at the moment cryptos are far too volatile.

So for now we’re left with the current monetary system of unlimited money-printing which in turn makes each U.S. dollar less valuable and each ounce of gold more valuable.

The Rise of Modern Monetary Theory (MMT)

What this is all pointing toward is the rapid adoption of modern monetary theory (MMT). I’ve written about the concept before.

In short proponents of MMT say that governments that issue their own currency as the U.S. does are free to spend as much as they want regardless of the amount of revenue generated. And if the government ends up with a spending deficit it can just print more money to cover the difference.

Isn’t this what we’re already doing? In 2020 the federal government spent a total of $6.55 trillion despite it collecting “only” $3.42 trillion—about half of that—in tax revenue.

What’s more the amount of M1 money supply—which includes the most liquid and readily available forms of money—was up an unprecedented 67% in December 2020 compared to the same month the previous year.

As Ray Dalio billionaire founder of Bridgewater the world’s biggest hedge fund has said a number of times “Cash is trash.”

Our Favorite Ways to Get Exposure to Gold

So where does Dalio put his money instead? A look at Bridgewater’s third-quarter filings reveals large positions in physical gold and gold mining companies. At 11.6% the gold-backed SPDR Gold Trust is the fund’s second-largest position. The fifth-largest position at 3.4% is the iShares Gold Trust.

Among the gold producers in Dalio’s portfolio are Newmont Yamana Gold and Freeport-McMoRan.

Besides the securities already mentioned we also like to get exposure to gold and precious metal miners via the royalty companies.

Our two favorites that follow the royalty and streaming model Franco-Nevada and Wheaton Precious Metals have impressive track records of outperforming bullion and gold miners over multiple time periods in bull and bear markets.

Below you can see that Franco significantly beat gold and senior producers during periods when asset prices were rising as well as falling.

Wheaton similarly performed well over multiple periods. For the one-year three-year five-year and 10-year periods Wheaton crushed not just gold and silver but also miners and the popular VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF.

These strong track records have resulted in the companies consistently returning value to shareholders.

As of September 30 Wheaton had an incredible $1.2 billion declared in dividends. Franco meanwhile has had 14 straight years of dividend increases with $1.4 billion paid out since its 2008 initial public offering (IPO).

Both companies are scheduled to report in early March which I’m eagerly awaiting.

When it comes to competitive esports there's a lot more that goes on behind the scenes than just parking yourself in front of a video game for hours on end. There are dietary restrictions exercise routines and even sleep schedules designed for esports athletes. In that sense you could say it's not that different from conventional sporting disciplines.

But having to manage your lifestyle also means you'll need some way to monitor and track it. Just like how marathon runners and triathletes might want to keep track of their timings Garmin's new Instinct Esports Edition smartwatch is designed to work in the same way except it's meant to operate in the context of an esports athlete.

Sure it definitely seems laughable when you first think about it - after all unlike running or swimming your gaming skills aren't something that can really be converted into consistent numbers and trends so why is there a need to monitor stuff like heart rate and stress levels during gaming sessions? If anything it should display blood pressure too - I'm pretty sure mine spikes really often when I'm playing a ranked game of LoL.

Anyway the smartwatch which sports a rugged red-black exterior is not only equipped with a variety of functions but it is also purpose-built to military standards (MIL-STD 810) meaning it retains the trademark Garmin durability even when you're using it as a regular smartwatch. With regard to the aforementioned functions perhaps the most interesting of the bunch is the one that lets you livestream and embed your biometric data in real-time namely the STR3AMUP! PC streaming tool. On top of real-time monitoring users can also collate their data and port it onto their computer for storage and analysis when their gaming session has ended.

Of course those are just the standout functions. This iteration of the Garmin Instinct also features several quality of life features shared among many smartwatches such as the ability to synchronise with your mobile device and have your messages and notifications sent directly to your wrist. This removes the need for you to move across the room to pick up your phone - instead you can just glance over at your watch and carry on gaming immediately afterwards and you can rest assured it'll still have battery by the end too. After all assuming it's fully charged the Instinct sports up to 14 hours of use in smartwatch mode and up to 80 hours in esports mode.

As for pricing and availability the Garmin Instinct Esports Edition is now available for purchase at a suggested retail price of S$459 on Lazada Shopee KrisShop.com Garmin Online shop and other authorised retailers. Additionally if you purchase one and register the warranty before 28 Feb you could end up as one of five lucky winners to take home gaming gear by AOC Corsair Elgato and HyperX worth up to $389!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdzbWFyZW5hLmNvbS9mbGFzaGJhY2tfd2VpcmRfcGhvbmVzX2Zyb21fdW5leHBlY3RlZF9icmFuZHNfY29jYWNvbGFfYmljX2tmY19nYXJtaW4tbmV3cy00NzQ4MS5waHDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Flashback: weird phones from unexpected brands part 3 - Coca-Cola Bic KFC Garmin,"In the previous Flashback post we mentioned that Ericsson produced a special Coca-Cola edition phone. And this was years before the Pepsi phone mind you. But we won’t just focus on beverage-branded phones today instead we’ll go for general weirdness. Here are some more weird phones from unexpected brands.

The phone with a sweet tooth

Launched at the end of 2000 a year after the “unflavored” model became available the Ericsson A1018s Coca-Cola special edition arrived in the UK. This wasn’t available to just anyone oh no you had to earn it.

And by “earn it” we mean that you had to collect 60 ring pulls from Coke cans and/or phone tokens (paper tokens you could find attached to select bottles).



The Ericsson A1018s Coca-Cola special edition (image credit)

What you get in return was a promotional package with extensive Coca-Cola branding. This includes the phone itself which had a branded front panel the carrier logo on the screen was also swapped out. Even better the pre-loaded ringtone played the Coca-Cola theme but that was about it.

There are a few of these phones – and their original packaging – on eBay if you want to add one to your collection.

The disposable phone

When you hear the Bic brand name do you think pens or disposable razors? Whoever is responsible for this next item was thinking the latter – meet the Bic Phone a disposable phone marketed in France and Spain by Orange.

It was really an alcatel OT-S210 with the Bic Boy painted on (Bic was barely involved in this it just collected royalty payments for lending its name). Anyway here’s the idea behind this questionable gadget.



The (not quite) disposable Bic Phone

The Bic Phone would sell for €19 and come with a charged battery and 10 minutes of talk time. The battery would last up to 4 hours of calls (and you could listen to FM radio). The battery was easy to recharge over microUSB but recharging the minutes was a much bigger hassle.

You had to mail a registration form to Orange once accepted this added 50 minutes of talk time. Afterwards more minutes could be added with Mobicarte vouchers. So this isn’t really disposable but also not something meant for long-time use. It was something you would buy at the airport use up and stick in a drawer for the rest of time.

Considering that there’s a growing support for reducing electronic waste you’d think that the Bic Phone was something from the 90s or even 80s. Nope Orange concocted this idea in 2008.

The phone with 11 herbs and spices

Colonel Sanders has a secret recipe for fried chicken but we never expected him to cook up a smartphone. And yet in 2017 that’s just what he did – KFC was celebrating its 30 year anniversary since opening its first store in China and launched an Android-powered phone for super fans (based on the Huawei Enjoy 7 Plus).

Only 5000 units were made and they were available through a special page on Tmall or through the KFC app. This app was really the star of the show – it came pre-loaded on the phone and was popular because it allowed users to order and pay through their phone. Any phone mind you not just the KFC one. Not bad even if not quite amazing for 2017.

The K-music app was even more interesting. It put users in control of the music playlist in the KFC restaurant they were visiting – the company boasted 4000 KFC locations in China at the time.

The phone that was a SatNav

Well two phones actually. Have you heard the term “SatNav”? It stands for Satellite Navigation and refers to digital devices that use GPS (and similar positioning systems) to offer driving directions. Yes just like every smartphone under the Sun today.



The Asus-Garmin Nuvifone G60 was all about satellite navigation

But this was 2009 and digital maps still required expensive purchases and subscriptions (this was before Nokia dropped the bomb). Garmin had a long history of building GPS devices – anything from hand-held receivers to plane cockpits – while Asus brought in the phone know-how. A match made in heaven.



The nuvifone G60 ran a custom Linux-based OS

Two phones were demoed at MWC 2009 (check out our report from then). The Garmin-Asus nuvifone G60 had a 3.55” resistive touchscreen (272 x 480 px) ran a custom Linux distro and had 4GB of on-board storage (plus a microSD slot maps can be huge if you want to traverse a whole continent).

The other was the Garmin-Asus nuvifone M20 a Windows Mobile 6.1 device (later updated to 6.5). It had a smaller but much sharper display 2.8” with 480 x 640 px resolution and was powerd by an early Qualcomm chipset (528 MHz CPU).



The Garmin-Asus nuvifone M20 was smaller and ran Windows Mobile

Both had on-board GPS receivers of course as well as a compass. The loudspeaker lived up to its name as a voice blasted from it giving you turn-by-turn directions. There was also Ciao! which was billed as a “location-based social networking” app. Its main feature was the ability to share your location with your friend (who could then use their Garmin device to navigate your location).



A look around the nuvifone M20

Anyway the following year the two companies released the nuvifone A50 an Android 2.1 Eclair phone and the nuvifone M10 another Windows Mobile device. They featured Garmin’s PhotoReal Junction View. No not like Street View a 3D rendering of the junction but still quite useful.

On the next “Weird phones”...

That wraps it up for today but there are other weird gadgets to cover in future installments - we can almost taste them... okay we should probably lay off the junk food smartphones.",,,,,,,,,

He is now tied with former Capital Mike Gartner for seventh place on the All Time List for career goals. The goal was a game winner in Overtime to seal a 4-3 victory.

In addition to it being Ovechkin’s 708th career goal and his second goal of the 2020-21 season it was his 111th game winning goal which allowed him to take over sole possession of fourth place on that list breaking a tie with Brett Hull and Teemu Selanne. It was also the 23rd Overtime goal in his career extending his first place lead. Ovechkin met with the media following the game:

The next player to pass on the All Time Goal Scoring list would be Phil Esposito whose career total is 717 and is in sixth place. Congratulations Alex.

There was a question if Alex Ovechkin would even play on Saturday considering he hasn’t practiced since he and his fellow Russian teammates were put in seclusion for breaking COVID protocols. Instead he played and scored the overtime goal in a 4-3 game that the Capitals probably didn’t deserve to win.

With a 3-0 lead but being badly outshot the Caps had too much time to kill. The Bruins clawed their way back scoring their third goal with the goalie pulled and sending the game into overtime. Much of the game was spent in the Caps’ zone as the Bruins outshot the Caps 42-21 in regulation.

In overtime Ovi did what Ovi does scoring his second goal of the season and the 708th of his career which ties former Cap Mike Gartner for 7th place all-time. Ovi now trails Phil Esposito (717) Marcel Dionne (731) Brett Hull (741) Jaromir Jagr (766) Gordie Howe (801) and Wayne Gretzky (894) on the all-time goals list.

It was also Ovi’s 24th overtime game-winning goal which is an all-time record. It was the 111th game-winning goal of his career one better than Hull and Teemu Selanne. He trails Esposito (118) Howe (121) and Jagr (135) on that all-time list.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2NhdGh5aGFja2wvMjAyMS8wMS8zMS9lbXBsb3llZS1leHBlcmllbmNlLWlzLWJlY29taW5nLWFzLWltcG9ydGFudC1hcy1jdXN0b21lci1leHBlcmllbmNlLXZyLS1hci1jYW4tdW5sb2NrLWV4cy1mdWxsLXBvdGVudGlhbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Employee Experience Is Becoming As Important As Customer Experience: VR And AR Can Unlock EX's Full Potential,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/cathyhackl/2021/01/31/employee-experience-is-becoming-as-important-as-customer-experience-vr--ar-can-unlock-exs-full-potential/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2NhdGh5aGFja2wvMjAyMS8wMS8zMS9lbXBsb3llZS1leHBlcmllbmNlLWlzLWJlY29taW5nLWFzLWltcG9ydGFudC1hcy1jdXN0b21lci1leHBlcmllbmNlLXZyLS1hci1jYW4tdW5sb2NrLWV4cy1mdWxsLXBvdGVudGlhbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy53YXNoaW5ndG9ucG9zdC5jb20vc3BvcnRzL2NhcGl0YWxzL2NhcGl0YWxzLWJydWlucy1hbGV4LW92ZWNoa2luLzIwMjEvMDEvMzAvNDE1NzgwMjItNjI4ZS0xMWViLTkwNjEtMDdhYmNjMWY5MjI5X3N0b3J5Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Alex Ovechkin returns scores OT winner for Capitals vs. Bruins,Alex Ovechkin lifted his hands in jubilation and yelled as his 708th career goal doubled as the overtime winner Saturday night at Capital One Arena.

According to research firms Gartner and Canalys over 30 million of the devices shipped last year with somewhere between 11 and 11.7 million shipping in Q4 alone. Canalys says that’s a staggering 287 percent more than were shipped in Q4 2019.

The firms disagree on how much growth this is when compared to 2019 but both estimate that it’s a lot: Gartner estimates that Chromebooks are up 80 percent while Canalys says it’s 109 percent. For comparison PC sales were up by 11 percent this year which is the biggest growth the category had seen in a decade. This isn’t to give the impression that Chromebooks outsold PCs — Gartner estimates there were 275 million traditional computers sold this year but it does show that one category is experiencing an explosion in growth while another is recovering after a dip.

Education has a lot to do with it according to Canalys. Chromebooks are big sellers in the education market and schools had to find a way to provide at-home students with computers for remote learning during COVID. Even the Vice President of Microsoft Education agrees that Chromebooks are great for schools — according to audio from a leaked meeting obtained by Business Insider he told his employees that “[i]n many cases when schools are buying Chromebooks or Windows PCs Chromebooks are still faster and cheaper they are easier to deploy and manage.”"

Senior Reporter

ZIMBABWEAN health experts based in the United Kingdom are working with the Catholic University of Zimbabwe (CUZ) on a US$450 million project to develop a medical school teaching hospital and pharmaceutical plant next to the university’s campus along Joshua Mqabuko Nkomo (Airport) Road in Harare.

The facility is being set up within the Medical Enterprise Economic Zone anchored around academic medical teaching research and highly specialised clinical services.

The Catholic University will also offer the medical degrees as the university partner.

Zimbabwe’s Ambassador to the United Kingdom Colonel (Retired) Christian Katsande said Professor Ian Chikanza a Zimbabwean consultant physician in Rheumatology (Adult & Pediatric) based in the United Kingdom was working with the Catholic University of Zimbabwe (CUZ) on the project to develop a medical school teaching hospital and pharmaceutical plant.

This was part of efforts to engage investors in line with the “Zimbabwe is Open for Business” mantra.

Ambassador Katsande said that the initiative was envisaged to strengthen the healthcare system in Zimbabwe making Harare a leading centre of medical excellence in Africa.

“This facility is also expected to lead in drug development and production as well supply the much-needed generic drugs in Zimbabwe and SADC member states.

“This state-of-the-art teaching hospital is expected to provide highly specialised medical services and attract medical tourism” said Ambassador Katsande.

A pharmaceutical company would also be established to ensure that all drugs were available for the medical centre and other hospitals in Zimbabwe and the region.

“The funding for the project is being pursued.

“The entire investment is estimated to cost US$450 million.”

The project will include a US$120 million 200-bed hotel for medical visitors/tourists to be built not too far from the hospital site and GE Healthcare will provide the majority of the latest state-of-the-art medical equipment.

The hospital will be paperless and will use the latest electronic health records system being developed by a team set up by Prof Chikanza.

The embassy is also engaging Zimbabwean professionals in the UK health sector to set up the Zimbabwe-UK Health Alliance.

“The alliance is envisaged to be an umbrella organisation for UK institutions and organisations undertaking healthcare capacity building activities in Zimbabwe.

“It is expected to be a mechanism to support and better coordinate its member organisations and ensure that their activities are in sync with the priorities of the Zimbabwe Government.”

The main objective of the health alliance was to support healthcare and the public sector in Zimbabwe.

It will focus on identification and evaluation of health challenges in Zimbabwe and provide innovative interventions drawn from the expertise experience and skill set of its members and partners.

The Zimbabwe-UK Health Alliance is also expected to provide a platform to explore opportunities for learning and development for health workers and institutions in both Zimbabwe and the UK.

It is also aimed at improving coordination among UK organisations’ activities and contributions to the health sector in Zimbabwe facilitate training and exchanges of knowledge and expertise and coordinate outreach programmes and volunteering activities by Diaspora health practitioners.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vbXNwb3dlcnVzZXIuY29tL21pY3Jvc29mdC1hbm5vdW5jZS10aGUtcHVibGljLXJlbGVhc2Utb2YtZGlyZWN0bWwtYXMtYS1zdGFuZGFsb25lLWFwaS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Microsoft announce the public release of DirectML as a standalone API,"Read our disclosure page to find out how can you help MSPoweruser sustain the editorial team Read more

Today Microsoft announced the public release of DirectML as a standalone API for Win32 UWP and WSL applications.

DirectML is available in every one of the billion Windows 10 devices worldwide and over a hundred applications already take advantage of DirectML—with over two hundred million GPU- hardware accelerated inferences performed daily on Windows.

The applications range from photo editing applications enabling new user experiences through AI to tools that help you train machine learning models for your applications with little effort by leveraging the computing power of any DirectX 12 GPU.

To make it even easier for applications to take advantage of DirectML Microsoft is releasing DirectML as a standalone API in a single NuGet package Microsoft.AI.DirectML.

See examples of how it is already being used below:

Model Inference on the Edge with Windows ML

Machine learning is helping people work more efficiently and DirectML provides the performance conformance and low-level control developers need to enable these experiences. Frameworks like Windows ML and ONNX Runtime layer on top of DirectML making it easy to integrate high-performance machine learning into your application.

Once the domain of science fiction scenarios like “enhancing” an image are now possible with contextually aware algorithms that fill in pixels more intelligently than traditional image processing techniques. DxO’s DeepPRIME technology illustrates the use of neural networks to simultaneously denoise and demosaic digital images. DxO leverages Windows ML and DirectML to harness the performance and quality their users expect.

Healthcare is another field leveraging machine learning techniques in interesting ways. Consider a sonographer using an ultrasound device to evaluate fetal brain development during their patient’s pregnancy. Acquiring the required planes and taking the required measurements for this is challenging because it requires lots of manual input from the sonographer. This is where GE Healthcare’s Voluson™ Ultrasound Devices comes in handy: pre-trained neural networks help the sonographer using the ultrasound probe automatically segment specific imaging planes from a volume and perform manual measurements. Previously identifying the approriate planes and measurements required time-consuming manual adjustments. GE Healthcare relies on Windows ML and DirectML for delivering consistent and reliable results across a broad range of their ultrasound devices.

An exciting area of growth is at the intersection of machine learning and real-time graphics in video games where performance is critical. Early applications in this area include using neural networks for superior image upscaling and filling in the sampling gaps of ray-traced images; these techniques are making it possible to present high-resolution gameplay without the cost of high-resolution rendering. The DirectML Super Resolution sample showcases how DirectML can integrate seamlessly with these real-time graphics intensive applications.

Machine learning is a rapidly evolving field and new applications like these are introduced every day: models are used for transcribing audio translating hand-written notes into text fault detection in manufacturing and many more! DirectML has provided the hardware acceleration support needed for these scenarios since Windows 10 version 1903. Now the DirectML NuGet package offers our latest hardware acceleration investments even sooner to framework and application developers. If your model is representable using the ONNX format then you too can tap into DirectML.

Training Models with TensorFlow and Lobe

Accelerating inference is where DirectML started: supporting training workloads across the breadth of GPUs in the Windows ecosystem is the next step. In September 2020 Microsoft open sourced TensorFlow with DirectML to bring cross-vendor acceleration to the popular TensorFlow framework. This project is all about enabling rapid experimentation and training on your PC regardless of which GPU you have on your device with a simple and painless setup process. Microsoft also know many machine learning developers depend on tools libraries and containerized workloads that only work with Unix-like operating systems so DirectML runs in both Windows and the Windows Subsystem for Linux. DirectML makes it easy for you to work with the environment and GPU you already have.

Machine learning is also becoming increasingly accessible with tools like Lobe – an easy to use app that has everything you need to bring your machine learning ideas to life. To get started collect and label your images and Lobe will automatically train a custom machine learning model for you. On Windows Lobe uses DirectML to deliver great performance across a wide range of GPUs. When training is done you can try out your model and ship it to any platform you choose.

Getting Started with DirectML

If you’re a developer looking to benefit from hardware accelerated machine learning through DirectML get started today with the framework package or application that works best for you:

In addition to all of the investments Microsoft has updated their documentation bringing more detail than ever before along with new code samples and learning resources making it easier to integrate DirectML with your application. Microsoft has also added new content for developers to the DirectML GitHub repo:

· DirectMLX a new C++ library that wraps DirectML to enable easier and simpler usage especially for combining operators into blocks or even into complete models.

· PyDirectML a Python binding to quickly experiment with DirectML and the Python samples without writing a full C++ sample.

· Sample applications in both C++ and Python including a full end-to-end implementation of real-time object detection using YOLOv4.

This post only scratches the surface of what’s possible with machine learning and DirectML and Microsoft is excited to see where developers take DirectML next.

AI Developers can keep an eye on the DirectML GitHub for new resources and future updates on the investments Microsoft is making.",,,,,,

Neobanks are digital banks that can only be reached through an online platform. It provides all its services through a web or mobile portal. These neobanks do not have physical banks that users can visit.

With the demand for faster round-the-clock service many banking institutes have taken to offering digital or virtual services. Real Research launched a survey to find out just how popular neobanks are on a global level. Our insight draws light to the public’s awareness considerations and expectations from neobanks and their offers.

Highlights

Over 56% of the respondents already hold a neobank account and prefer mobile banking as their preferred banking channel.

Over 60% of the respondents say they gain greater customer experience with neobanks.

Neobank users fulfill various banking needs with neobanks including fund transfers bill payments savings international remittance and more.

Over 43% of the respondents agree to 24/7 access to banking being the greatest benefit of neobanks.

Mobile Banking Prevails Over 57% Prefer Mobile Banking

From a total of 200000 respondents 57.5% said they prefer mobile banking as their preferred banking channel. While 30.7% said they prefer traditional banks and 11.7% chose web banking. The popularity of mobile banking could easily be due to the fact that almost everyone now owns a mobile phone. Unlike traditional banks neobanks do not have a weekly day off thus giving their users simultaneous access to their assets throughout the week at any time.

Interestingly web banking seems to be the least favorable option. This could possibly be due to the lack of ownership of personal laptops tablets or desktops. It could also stem from the possibility that not all homes could have a wifi connection while it is highly possible for most phones to have access to mobile data.

Furthermore over 60000 of the respondents were of the 19-29 age group and over 50000 fell between the 29-39 age group. Additionally a little over 30000 respondents were aged between 39-49 while the rest fell above the age of 49 and above. A fair estimation would be that the older one is the less likely they are to have access or the expertise to use mobile banking services.

Overall the survey saw more male respondents than female respondents. This could possibly be due to the fact that men could likely be more in charge of the finances within their families.

Over 46% Already Hold a Neobank Account

The survey also confirms that out of the total 200000 respondents 46.2% (97627) said that they already own a neobank account. While 53.8% said that they do not. Out of the majority that answered ‘Yes the highest number of respondents hailed from India with 109434 (54.72%). This was followed closely by Bangladesh with 46203 (23.10%) and the USA with 12530 (6.27%).

Of the respondents who said ‘Yes 83605 were male and 14020 were female. This could possibly be due to the fact that men are more encouraged to find work than women. Hence men must find their own way to manage their finances. While women who are working could possibly have their assets stored with accounts linked to other family members.

When asked what reasons influenced them to choose a neobank over a traditional bank the answer to that was mostly dominated by two options. The reputation and excellent service offered by the neobank got the highest response with 65789 (32.89%) votes. While the second-highest reason went to its easy application process with 65491 (32.75%).

The 29-39 age group was most satisfied by neobanks’ reputation and excellent services. In contrast the 19-29 age group was more content with the easy application process.

Overall (60.15%) of the respondents said that they believe neobanks provide a more pleasant customer experience compared to a traditional bank. Mobile banking is open 24/7 and can cater to its users at any time and in any location. Traditional banks are only available at certain times and only in their physical location thus making it hard for them to offer a full-fledged customer experience.

Neobanks Offer Greater Customer Experience with 24/7 Services

From the data we can conclude that the most important factor that leads to users adopting neobank accounts over traditional ones would be the neobanks’ ability to provide 24/7 banking access to their users. A total of 87681 (43.84%) said that they consider 24/7 access to banking as the main benefit of having a neobank account.

This was then followed by 87681 (29.65%) respondents choosing simplified onboarding processes as the next main benefit. They feel the ability to open accounts seamlessly through a mobile portal and so forth is an important advantage with neobanks. This option was most popular with the 19-29 age group.

27680 (13.84%) respondents considered a user-friendly platform as the third most important benefit. With neobanks users have a portal on their mobile phone where they can find everything they need at the swipe of their fingers. A single tap showcases all their options allowing easy connectivity with banking support and flawless communication thanks to 24/7 services.

Unlike with traditional banks where users must physically travel to the bank wait to be attended only to find out that the help they seek is at a different branch or off on vacation. Even something as trivial as a busted printer could trigger a bad customer experience. Therefore neobanks offer a much attractive array of offers with its speedy and efficient user-friendly app.

Younger Millennials & Gen Z Fulfill Their Banking Needs With Neobanks

When asked about the type of transactions mostly conducted by neobank users a great deal of the respondents chose fund transfer. It received a total of 58440 (29.6%) votes. The second most frequent answer went to bill payment. It carries 50174 (25.4%) of the total votes.

It seems most users tend to lean towards neobanks for especially the simplest most basic banking needs. Of course transferring a few funds to many people sounds simpler through a mobile phone than visiting a physical bank. Neobanks eliminate the need to interact with another human to accomplish simple tasks.

With a simple push of a button users can pay all their bills and transfer funds in one shot without having to rely on the help and presence of another party. The platform provided by neobanks simplifies any and all possible needs one would expect to have at a physical bank only much faster and more private.

With 37475 (19.0%) votes international remittance took third place. Followed by savings with 30071 (15.2%) votes. Thus leaving 21460 (10.9%) respondents who picked others as their primary use on their neobank accounts.

It is interesting to note that the age group of 19-29 has been the highest pick with all five options. This age group seems to be the one that is using neobanks to process the majority of all their banking needs. Possibly due to the fact that younger generations are more comfortable relying on technology to handle their financial matters than strangers behind a desk. They are well versed in the art of mobile technology and have clearly proven their faith in their devices.

Neobanks Are Worth Using

As for the respondents’ view on the safety of using neobanks our survey reveals that while the majority of the respondents see neobanking as a safe option some still think that it is unsafe. Only 64806 (32.8%) perceive neobanking as a very safe option.

On the other hand 43535 (22.0%) said they find neobanks somewhat safe while 27.1% (53528) chose to stay neutral.

This leaves 11.4% (22431) finding neobanks somewhat unsafe and 6.7% (13320) finding them very unsafe. This could possibly be due to a lack of knowledge about the technicalities behind the services. It could also be the fear of trying out something new or a general lack of trust in the unfamiliar.

Hence it seems although most respondents aren’t completely certain about the safety of neobanks they will still recommend its services to others.

Over half of the respondents picked ‘Yes’ which is a total of 103814 (52.5%) responses while 44739 (22.6%) responses said ‘No.’ The second highest responses went with a neutral option. This is possibly due to the absence of prior experience with neobanking so far.

Conclusion

From the collected data we can conclude that the public is quite aware of neobanks and their services. Moreover out of the 200000 respondents most have a positive view of the digital banking options that come with neobanking. While almost half of the respondents already hold a neobank account some are still skeptical about the safety of their assets.

However it is important to note that neobanks are considered an excellent option for those seeking 24/7 banking services. Most respondents on this survey use neobanks to process a majority of their banking needs especially those between the 19-29 age group. They also rate better in enhanced customer experience compared to traditional banking.

The cross-border fiber optic cable will connect to a submarine cable in the Arabian Sea to provide service to countries participating in China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and Europe.

It is part of the larger 15000 km-long submarine cable system – the Pakistan East Africa Connecting Europe (PEACE) system.

Nikkei Asia has reported that sea cable will be laid in March after the government approval this month for Cybernet a local internet service provider to construct an Arabian Sea landing station in Karachi.

China’s leading fiber optic and power cable makers are heading Hengtong Group a consortium of telecom companies from Africa Pakistan and Hong Kong to install the PEACE cable in the Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean.

PEACE Cable International Network Co Ltd was founded in 2018 and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hengtong Optic-Electric. It will offer very low latency routes from China to both Europe and Africa.

What Is Digital Silk Road?

As part of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) China had launched the Digital Silk Road (DSR) Initiative in 2015. Under DSR China provides assistance to improve telecommunication networks artificial intelligence capabilities cloud computing e-commerce and mobile payment systems surveillance technology smart cities and other high-tech areas.

So far 16 countries are known to have signed agreements with China on DSR-related investments. Countries in Africa the Middle East and parts of Eastern Europe Latin America and Southeast Asia are easy targets since they lack high-quality technology wireless phone networks and broadband internet coverage.

However the whole project raises serious security concerns. The Chinese government can easily access sensitive data as Chinese companies build telecommunications and other infrastructure. Similar was the case when security concerns were raised on Huawei’s 5G infrastructure.

DSR In Pakistan

The West may have concerns over Chinese digital infrastructure but Pakistan seems to have complete trust in China. The PEACE cable in the Arabian Sea will be connected with the fiber optic cable between Rawalpindi and the port cities of Karachi and Gwadar.

The telecommunications branch of the Pakistan Army the Special Communications Organization (SCO) will be laying a fiber optic cable between Rawalpindi and the port cities of Karachi and Gwadar in partnership with China’s Huawei Technologies.

The 850km fiber optic cable links the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in southwest China to Rawalpindi. The northern section of the link has been operational since 2018. It provides secure communication between China and Pakistan.

Why Pakistan Prefers Link Through China?

According to Telegeography a Washington-based telecommunications market research company Pakistan is served by seven submarine cables at present of which four come out of India.

Major Gen. Amir Azeem Bajwa the then director-general of SCO had raised this concern in 2017 before a parliamentary committee on information technology. He had said that much of Pakistan’s internet traffic was routed through India.

Amid fears that sensitive data was vulnerable to hacking Bajwa had sought approval for an alternative network to service Gwadar. Since Pakistan didn’t have enough funds China provided loans services and infrastructure to set up the network.

As the government reform group Public Citizen tweeted “If you’re spending $740000000000 annually on ‘defense’ but fascists dressed for the renaissance fair can still storm the Capitol as they please maybe it’s time to rethink national security?”

At a time of acute concern about the health of our democracy any such rethinking must among other things focus on strengthening the authority of civilians and civilian institutions over the military in an American world where almost the only subject the two parties in Congress can agree on is putting up ever more money for the Pentagon. This means so many in our political system need to wean themselves from the counterproductive habit of reflexively seeking out military or retired military voices to validate them on issues ranging from public health to border security that should be quite outside the military’s purview.

It’s certainly one of the stranger phenomena of our era: after 20 years of endless war in which trillions of dollars were spent and hundreds of thousands died on all sides without the U.S. military achieving anything approaching victory the Pentagon continues to be funded at staggering levels while funding to deal with the greatest threats to our safety and “national security” — from the pandemic to climate change to white supremacy — proves woefully inadequate. In good times and bad the U.S. military and the “industrial complex” that surrounds it which President Dwight D. Eisenhower first warned us about in 1961 continue to maintain a central role in Washington even though they’re remarkably irrelevant to the biggest challenges facing our democracy.

These days it’s completely normal for military and defense officials to weigh in endlessly on what once would have been civilian matters. As the Biden years begin it’s time to give some serious thought to how to demilitarize our democracy.

Unfortunately in the America of 2021 the short-term benefit of relying on the widely accepted credibility of military figures to promote policies of every sort is obvious indeed. Who in the political class in the nation’s capital wouldn’t want a stamp of approval from dozens of generals active or retired endorsing their favorite initiative or candidate? (It’s something in years past the authors of this piece have been guilty of as well.) As it happens though such approval comes at a high price undermining as it does the authority of civilian officials and agencies while skewing resources toward the Pentagon that should be invested elsewhere to keep us truly safe.

It’s an essential attribute of the American system that the military remains under civilian authority. These days however given the number of current or retired military officers who have become key arbiters of what we should do on a dizzying array of critical issues civilian control is the policy equivalent of an endangered species.

In the last election season long before the attack on the Capitol there was already an intense national discussion about how to prevent violence at the polls a conversation that all too quickly (and disturbingly) focused on what role the military should play in the process. General Mark Milley chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was repeatedly asked to provide assurances that it would have no role in determining the outcome of the election something that in another America would have been a given.

Meanwhile some actually sought more military involvement. For example in a widely debated “open letter” to Milley retired Army officers John Nagl and Paul Yingling stated that “if Donald Trump refuses to leave office at the expiration of his constitutional term the United States military must remove him by force and you must give that order.” Proposals of this sort undermine the integrity of the many laws Congress and the states have put in place to prevent the military or armed vigilantes from playing any role in the electoral process.

Similarly both former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden have identified the military as a key future player in distributing the Covid-19 vaccine something that could and should be handled by public-health institutions if only they like the Pentagon had adequate resources.

The military knows best?

During and after the attack on the Capitol officials from the military and national security worlds were given pride of place in discussions about the future of our democracy. Their opinions were sought out by the media and others on a wide range of issues that fell well outside their primary areas of expertise. A letter from 10 former secretaries of defense calling on the Republican caucus to respect the results of the election was given headline attention while political figures pressed to have retired military officers involved in the January 6th assault tried in military not civilian courts.

Before pursuing the second impeachment of Donald Trump House Speaker Nancy Pelosi typically turned to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs (who isn’t even in the civilian chain of command) to seek assurance that he could stop the president from starting a last-minute nuclear war. And none of this was faintly unusual given that retired military officers have regularly been asked to weigh in on subjects as varied as abortion rights climate change and childhood obesity. It’s not of course that such figures shouldn’t be able like anyone else to offer their opinions or support on matters of public health and safety but that their voices shouldn’t matter more than those of public-health experts scientists medical professionals or other civilians.

Despite its failure to win a war in decades the military remains one of America’s most respected institutions getting the kind of appreciation that generally doesn’t extend to other more successful public servants. After almost 20 years of forever wars it’s hard at this point to accept that the military’s reputation for wisdom is deserved. In fact continually relying on retired generals and other present or former national security officials as validators effectively erodes the credibility of and the public’s trust in other institutions that are meant to keep us healthy and safe.

In the Covid-19 moment it should be clear that relying on narrowly defined notions of national security harms our democracy a subject that none of those military or former military figures are likely to deal with. In addition in all too many cases current and retired military officials have abused the public trust in ways that call into question their right to serve as judges of what’s important or even to imagine that they could provide objective advice. For one thing a striking number of high-ranking officers on leaving the military pass through the infamous revolving door of the military-industrial complex into positions as executives lobbyists board members or consultants for the defense industry. They work on behalf of firms like Raytheon Lockheed Martin Boeing and General Dynamics that receive a combined $100 billion annually in Pentagon contracts with little accountability even as they remain key go-to media figures.

They then use their former rank and the prestige attached to it to lobby Congress and influence the media on the need for endless wars and an ever-increasing military budget to support major weapons programs like Lockheed Martin’s troubled F-35 Joint Strike Fighter — all without bothering to disclose that they stand to gain financially from the positions they’re taking. And the prospect of a big fat salary in the weapons sector upon retirement also exerts an unhealthy influence on officers still serving in the military who are often loath to anger or in any way alienate their potential future employers.

This revolving-door phenomenon is widespread. A study by the Project on Government Oversight found that in 2018 alone there were 645 cases in which the top 20 defense contractors hired former government officials military officers members of Congress and senior congressional legislative staff as lobbyists board members or executives. This should hardly inspire public trust in their opinions.

In some cases ex-military officers have even taken to the airwaves and the op-ed pages of newspapers to advocate for war without disclosing their ties to the arms industry. A 2008 New York Times investigation for example revealed that a number of retired-officers-turned-media pundits with continuing defense industry ties had for years advocated for the Iraq War at the Pentagon’s behest. Ex-generals like former Trump administration Defense Secretary James Mattis who served on the board of General Dynamics before taking the helm of the Pentagon and returned there shortly after stepping down too often use their stature to refrain from providing basic information to the media while befogging the transparency and accountability that should be a pillar of democracy.

The politicization of the military

When civilian voices and policies are eclipsed as the central determinants in how our democracy should operate a larger dilemma arises: continuing to rely on the military as a primary source of judgment for what’s right or wrong in the civilian world risks politicizing the armed forces too. From retired Lieutenant General Michael Flynn leading chants of “Lock her up!” at the 2016 Republican National Convention to the competition between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump as well as in the 2020 election campaign between Joe Biden and Donald Trump to see who could get more retired generals to endorse him or her only helps militarize the civilian election process and politicizes what should be a nonpartisan institution.

Given the more than a trillion dollars Americans annually invest in the national security state it’s striking to note for instance how such institutions let us down when it came to addressing the threats of white nationalism. Last summer the Intercept uncovered a buried FBI report on the shortcomings of various federal agencies when it came to dealing with domestic terrorism. Before the 2020 election the bureau refused to release that report on the domestic threat of white supremacy. Last year in a similar fashion the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) withheld for months its assessment of the same “lethal” threat of racist extremism in this country.

While there must be a full investigation of what happened at the Capitol on January 6th reports seem to indicate a striking blindness in the national security state to the possibility of such an attack. It’s not that the DHS the FBI or the military need an influx of new funds to face the problem. Rather what’s needed at this moment in history is a clearer focus on the real risks to our country which have little to do with foreign terrorists the Taliban or other such groups the U.S. has been fighting abroad for years on end. The Department of Defense typically did itself and the rest of us no favors by burying a report on widespread racism in the ranks of the military which though completed in 2017 didn’t see the light of day until this January. Only in the aftermath of the riot at the Capitol did that organization finally begin to truly address its own white-supremacy problems.

The military like so many other American institutions has failed to reckon seriously with deep-seated racism in its ranks. Even before the January 6th insurrection it was clear that such racism made it nearly impossible for Black officers to be promoted. And while many questioned the naming of key military bases after Confederate generals the issue has only recently been addressed (over a presidential veto at that) with the creation of a new commission to rename them. Reports of active duty reserve and veteran members of the military aiding the Capitol insurrection only bring into stark relief the inexcusable costs of not having addressed the problem earlier.

More Pentagon spending won’t make us safer

There are also high costs to be paid for relying on the Department of Defense to handle problems that have nothing to do with its primary mission. Using the armed forces as key players in addressing crises that aren’t military in nature only further undermines civilian institutions and is often counterproductive as well.

In the initial stages of the Covid-19 pandemic a number of politicians called for President Trump to use the Defense Production Act (as it seems Biden will indeed soon do) and the Department of Defense to ramp up the production of N95 masks ventilators and other personal protective equipment. The story of what happened to such funds in the Trump years should be telling. The Washington Post discovered that $1 billion in supposed pandemic relief money was instead funneled directly to defense contractors and $70 million of the funds the Pentagon spent went to ventilators that proved unfit for Covid-19 patients. While some of that money did go to bolster mask supply chains another Post investigation discovered that such efforts did not come close to addressing national shortfalls and amounted to less than the department spends on instruments uniforms and travel for military bands.

Perhaps the most disturbing cost of our overreliance on the military can be found in Congress’s budget and policy priorities. In December of last year a bill to authorize nearly $740 billion in Pentagon spending garnered enough votes to easily overcome President Trump’s veto (motivated mainly by his refusal to condone renaming military bases named after Confederate generals) at the very moment when Congress was blocking legislation to give $2000 relief checks directly to Covid-19 embattled Americans.

By now two decades into the twenty-first century it’s clear that more money for the Pentagon hasn’t made this country safer. It has however helped give the military an ever more central role in our previously civilian political world. Biden’s selection of retired General Lloyd Austin III to be secretary of defense only emphasizes this point. While it’s certainly laudatory to appoint the first Black leader to that position Austin has retired so recently that he needed a congressional waiver from a law requiring a seven-year cooling off period before taking up such a civilian post (just as Mattis did four years ago) — another sign that civilian control of the military is continuing to weaken. In addition now that he has retired from his role in private industry Austin stands to make a small fortune up to $1.7 million when he divests his stock holdings in Raytheon Technologies.

“In the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military-industrial complex” President Eisenhower warned Americans in his 1961 farewell address. How right he proved to be! Sixty years later it’s become all too clear that more must be done to deal with that very “unwarranted influence.” The immediate crises of the American republic should be clear enough right now: responding to the pandemic and restoring our civilian democracy. Certainly military leaders like Milley should be appreciated for agreeing on the need to prioritize the pandemic and oppose sedition. However more Pentagon spending and more military influence will not in the end make us any safer.

Dennis Robinson

It’s enough to make anyone believe in miracles. On Jan. 30 1981 a $10.5 million FB-111A jet bomber plummeted directly toward the most densely populated section of Portsmouth. Roughly 2500 people lived in the low-rent apartment complex then known as Sea Crest and Mariner’s Village. A spray of jet fuel set buildings on fire as the pilotless plane ripped into the earth. But 40 years later what might have been the world’s worst aviation disaster is scarcely a footnote in local history.

""There was a cascading liquid fire burning across the tops of the buildings"" police officer Albert Pace recalled years later. ""It looked like a great wave at the beach coming in only it was all flames of liquid fuel. It was pretty spectacular.""

Pace was nearing the end of an uneventful eight-hour shift when he turned his Portsmouth cruiser onto Circuit Road at 2:55 p.m. on Friday Jan. 30. Suddenly the sky fell. Pace heard a loud crackling noise overhead as a large fireball tore by him. The deafening explosion ruptured his inner ear.

Eleven-year-old Mike Chwalek was just exiting Wentworth School when he heard a very low-flying plane in the clear blue winter sky. “All of us kids stopped dead in our tracks” Chwalek recalls “and looking westward all of us saw this fighter jet just above the treetops of Seacrest Village the apartment complexes where most of the kids at my school lived.”

Chwalek recalls hearing two explosions the second when the pilots triggered their escape capsule. The plane did a loop in the air he says and then crashed below the tree line. He rushed with other kids to the scene of scorched trees and burning buildings. The boys picked up small bits of debris from the plane but got scared and ran off when they saw men in uniforms getting out of military trucks.

Bob Hersey an airfield firefighter and crash rescueman from the former Pease Air Force Base now Pease International Tradeport was among those early arrivals. “When I first got on scene there were no firefighters or fire equipment there” he said.

“A man exited [a burning] building on the left and he hollered for me to get a hose. I told him the engines weren't there and to stay out of his apartment and not to go back in.” Hersey waved the man away from a downed power line. He discovered an elderly man standing dazed on his porch and got him to safety then continued fighting the fire and searching for possible victims.

It was not the first or last mishap for the FB-111A. Of the 76 planes produced by General Dynamics 12 eventually crashed most disappearing deep in the woods of Maine and Vermont. Aircraft #68-0263 however was like no other. It hit like a meteor in the heart of a city barely 200 yards from a row of wooden houses spewing over 2000 gallons of flaming jet fuel and debris.

Impossibly no one was seriously injured. ""The good Lord was nice to us"" one witness said. Truer words were never spoken.

History Matters:American thugs vs. our better angels

Today the crash site is known as Osprey Landing and Spinnaker Point. The gentrified housing development is roughly halfway between downtown Portsmouth and the former Pease Air Force Base. The bomber missed the Pease runaway by roughly two miles. Exactly what happened remains a mystery.

Gary Berg a police officer from nearby Eliot Maine was driving in traffic near the malls of Newington when he heard a tremendous explosion and saw a plume of smoke to his right. Berg then spotted a large orange parachute supporting what looked like a space capsule floating to earth.

Berg followed the escape pod that had rocketed from the jet just 10 seconds before the crash. He was the first official on the scene. The parachute cables from the 3200-pound capsule were still snagged in a tree behind 398 Cutts Ave. The flotation bags designed to deploy in case of a water landing were damaged and never fully inflated.

Capt. Peter Carellas 33 and Maj. Ronald Reppe 39 were already standing outside their survival capsule when Officer Berg arrived. Both men were veterans from the 509th Bombardment Wing at Pease having logged over 2500 flying hours each. Pilot Carellas would bear the blame for the accident but it was Reppe the navigator and weapons system operator who had pulled the ejection initiator handle in the nick of time. Both men continued to fly after the accident. Neither consented to an interview for this article.

""Where are we?"" one of the crewmen asked Berg who explained their situation. They had landed reports later showed 1750 feet from the crash site. When a crewman asked if the plane had landed in the city Berg said simply ""Yes."" The two men looked despondent he remembered. They cheered up slightly when Berg added that so far there was no report of fatalities.

Pease Air Force Base officials quickly doused the rumor that the plane was carrying ""nukes."" Although the FB-111A was capable of carrying 37500 pounds of missiles or bombs according to a USAF spokesperson ""We don’t fly sorties around here with nuclear weapons on board for obvious reasons.""

Most residents in ""the village"" were allowed back in their homes by 7 p.m. that same evening. The 13 families left homeless by the crash were quickly given shelter in motels or moved to another apartment and compensated by Pease AFB for any damages according to press reports.

Today most Portsmouth residents scratch their heads when asked about the incident. Even longtime locals are often short on details. Some recall inaccurate accounts myths or rumors. Officer Albert Pace’s patrol car for example was not blown 25 feet by the explosion as the Manchester Union Leader reported. Pace today says he simply swerved off the road during the blinding explosion. The Portsmouth Herald originally reported that the crew escape pod landed in Eliot but later corrected the error. The base closed in 1990 and no memorial marks the spot where the city’s greatest tragedy never happened.

What caused the 1981 crash?

The official USAF Mishap Report released in 2006 stated the 1981 crash of an FB-111A was caused by ""incorrect"" actions of the pilot during a “stall spin.” No indisputable evidence contradicts the official conclusion that pilot Capt. Peter Carellas was technically responsible for the crash. Yet nagging questions remain about the engines the mission the flight path the performance of the bomber and the sequence of events that caused two seasoned crewmen to ditch over a populated area two miles from the Pease Air Force Base runway.

While some witnesses on the ground reported seeing a jet on fire the mishap report concluded that there was ""no evidence of an inflight fire."" The fact that two new engines had been installed on the crashed FB-111A just one day before the accident receives almost no mention in the mishap report. The engines appear in a lengthy list that records the date in which parts of the plane were last overhauled. In the report the engines are dated January 29 1981 with the simple notation ""NOT OVERHAULED SINCE NEW."" But the brand new Pratt & Whitney TF-30-P7 engines manufactured for General Dynamics for $1735000 were ruled out as a cause from the earliest moments of the investigation.

""The FB-111A was essentially a project that never lived up to its hopes"" said retired Portsmouth Herald editor John Whiteman. He should know. Whiteman is one of the few civilians who got to see the complex swing-wing bomber perform from the inside. Prior to the 1981 crash Whiteman took a 3.5-hour ride in a bomber out of Pease AFB. Equipped with an advanced terrain mapping system the fighter was able to travel below conventional radar at 100 feet above the ground. Cruising at 565 mph the FB-111A could reach speeds of 1600 mph at 36000 feet and travel 4500 miles between fill-ups.

The JAG investigative board as reported by Whiteman in April 1981 did not find pilot Peter Carellas legally responsible. In fact the board ""didn’t pinpoint any cause for the crash"" according to the Portsmouth Herald. Carellas testified that the plane exhibited ""unusual gyrations.""

Jack Goterch who spent over a year studying the 1981 accident has his own theory based on witnesses who saw the plane looping before the crash. ""The plane itself made the loop"" Gorterch suggests ""because of the unscheduled roll to port. That is it turned itself to the left more than once. I’ve come to believe that the ailerons that turn the plane were malfunctioning as they had been throughout the one hour flight. I'd bet my last dollar the problem was in the controls not the engine – or the pilot.""

The U.S. military has not commented on The Times report leading to speculation that the Pantsir S1 may have been taken away as part of testing its own IM-SHORAD. In the past U.S. military has used Russian equipment procured from former Soviet Bloc nations for testing and comparison with its own military hardware.

In 1997 Washington acquired twenty-one MiG- 29 jets from Moldova which were shipped to the U.S. and exhaustively evaluated there. Later some of these MiG-29s flown by German air force pilots were pitched against F 16 F/A 18 and F 15 of the USAF in exercise Red Flag an annual exercise held with foreign partners.

In Russia Vice-President of the Academy of Military Sciences (AVN) Sergey Modestov told Interfax news agency on Friday “The hardware itself is a good find for the United States. The knowledge gained can be used against those who have a similar armor (Pantsir S1).”

Currently under testing the IM-SHORAD is considered a direct competitor to the Pantsir-S1. Like the Russian system it provides low altitude defence against drones aircraft and helicopters. It will be the first system of its kind to be fielded by the U.S. Army.

Soldiers from the 5th Battalion 4th Air Defense Artillery Regiment out of Ansbach Germany traveled to the White Sands Missile Range to conduct training and operational testing of the Army’s IM-SHORAD system a U.S. Army announcement had said in November 2020.

The IM-SHORAD is one of the Army’s solutions to replace the aging Avenger short range air defense system. While the Avenger worked well in its day as a Cold War platform for the protection of Army units from close in air threats the system is showing its age being less survivable than other modern air defense systems and requiring a long set up time to get operational the announcement said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm90aW1lLmFlcm8vYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjcxMDQtbWlnLTQxLXdoYXQtaXQtd2FzLWFuZC13aGF0LWl0LXdhc250LXBhcnQtMdIBWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm90aW1lLmFlcm8vYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjcxMDQtbWlnLTQxLXdoYXQtaXQtd2FzLWFuZC13aGF0LWl0LXdhc250LXBhcnQtMS9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,MiG-41: what it was and what it wasn’t | Part 1,"Late January 2020 saw several sources claiming that the Russian state-owned corporation Rostec announced the start of the development of PAK DP or a “perspective aviation complex for long-range interception”. The plane developed under that project is most widely known as the MiG-41.

It was not the first time the start of its development was supposedly announced and this new announcement was to be frank rather dubious. In all essence the news was kicked up by a line in a Rostec press release dated January 22 and named “MiG-31BM: the high-flying bird”. The text was dedicated to the day of Air Defense Forces (a branch of the Russian military that no longer exists since the 90s) and celebrated the history of the MiG-31 high-speed interceptor from its creation to the latest modernization. The last paragraph of the release stated that the next generation of this type of fighter jet the PAK DP was currently in development.

Any official announcements mentioning this program are extraordinarily rare. So much so that all previous starts of the development were already forgotten and the line got turned into a brand new confirmation that Russia finally started working on its 6th generation fighter jet. Russian news outlet Ria Novosti was amongst the first to extrapolate the one line into a full story regurgitating rumors and snippets of information about the MiG-41 that were already in circulation.

The problem is there are a lot of those snippets and rumours are even more numerous. Furthermore first ones have an awful tendency to contradict latter ones and all of them rarely originate from any official sources.

Unfortunately it is impossible to untangle this situation without diving into the long long story of Soviet and post-Soviet heavy interceptors: the entire family of very fast aircraft its many dead ends and the way they are inseparable from what many call the MiG-41.

Hypersonic dreams

In the late 60s the MiG-25 Foxbat appeared and it was a truly groundbreaking plane: the fastest air-breathing aircraft at the time designed to intercept enemy targets at great distances and great speeds and scare Western observers with myths about its extraordinary capabilities. Contrary to those myths actual capabilities were very limited. Nevertheless the plane could routinely reach Mach 2 and even cross Mach 3 albeit with a risk of consuming its own engines in the process.



Early MiG-25 (Image: Wikipedia)

The plane was focused solely on high-altitude interception and meanwhile the US was working on aircraft capable of penetrating an airspace at the lowest altitude possible. Such a practice – nullifying all newest advances in air defense – was baked into the latest generation of American bombers from the brand new General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark to the Rockwell B-1 Lancer which had just entered development. On top of that the MiG-25 was no longer the fastest bird in town: SR-71 Blackbird had just started flying a reconnaissance plane the Foxbat could neither catch up with nor shoot down.

There was a need for a new heavy interceptor that could fly faster carry more powerful armament and most importantly – be adapted to a more diverse set of missions. Having a good low altitude performance would provide an additional ground attack capability while the new phased array radar would plug the air defense gap in the Russian far north beyond the coverage of an already stretched air defense network.

Right from the start the MiG-25 was taken as a basis with upgraded engines and avionics being supplemented with new wings that could offer more versatility. Different design bureaux offered different solutions to that which resulted in the E-155MP project with half a dozen variants. Variable sweep and delta wings were looked into but ultimately rejected: the most conservative variant with trapezoidal wings was chosen and became the MiG-31 Foxhound presented in the mid-to-late 70s.

Although it offered substantial improvements in terms of range versatility and reliability the speed remained the same. Modifications to the airframe were minimal. There was no need for that as the idea of the ground attack variant was discarded and there were no engines suitable for higher speed.

That was because Mach 3 – or more precisely Mach 3.5 – was practically the limit of conventional turbojet engines. The flow of air at such speeds made the use of a compressor a part that compressed air before ignition difficult and unnecessary. A completely new kind of engine had to be devised if the plane was to reach higher speeds and the Soviet Union – or anybody for that matter – had no such engine.

Nevertheless just as the development of the MiG-31 was being finalized in 1975 Mikoyan-Gurevich resumed the work on rejected solutions that could improve the performance of the interceptor even further. With an intel that Americans are developing their own planes capable of such speeds the program was assigned a high priority named “Project Maximum” and led by Nikolay Matiuk – the chief engineer of MiG-25.

It consisted of two parts: Type 301 (interceptor) and Type 321 (bomber) two aircraft that would supplement a basic layout of the Foxbat with variable-sweep wings and deployable canards.

A new engine had to be developed. While particularities are unclear and there is a lot of debate on the topic the prospective power plant was said to be a two in one: a conventional turbojet and a ramjet housed under the same cowling with a separator that would redirect a flow of air into one or another. A ramjet differs from a conventional jet engine in the fact that it lacks a compressor and uses sonic shockwaves to compress air before ignition.

In theory a combination of a turbojet and a ramjet is possible – SR-71 Blackbird used one with special pipes redirecting the airflow around its turbojet to act as a ramjet. The solution for the Project Maximum called D-102 was a lot more elegant. But it was never developed and there is little proof it would actually work.

After switching such engines into ramjet mode Type 301 interceptor would in theory maintain a cruise speed of 4250 kilometers per hour (2640 mph) and even reach a maximum speed of Mach 5 becoming the world’s first hypersonic fighter jet. Hypersonic – meaning a speed over five times greater than the speed of sound – brings with itself yet another set of challenges as the dynamics of flight change once again just like they did when crossing from subsonic into supersonic speeds. Hypersonic vehicles have to be designed with that in mind. As far as we can tell at least early variants of the Type 301/321 weren’t.



One of many possible variants of how Type 301/321 could have looked like (Image: dizzyfugu / Alternatehistory.com)

The aircraft retained the main outline of MiG-25 and MiG-31 except for overhauled wings and repositioned power plant. The dual-purpose engines were too massive to be fitted within the fuselage as in earlier iterations of the interceptor. They had to be carried on top in the rear section of the plane giving it a distinct look present in most renders of MiG-41 to this day.

The new MiG takes shape

It is unknown what happened to the project Maximum although quite clearly it fizzled out in the late 80s. According to some information from the 90s the research on the airframe for the Type 301/321 was completed and it was ready for the production of the prototype. There was no information on the engine though and it is likely that it was far from ready. Perhaps this problem was what really sank the Project Maximum.

But yet another ambitious project emerged in its place. It was led by a couple of engineers that came to Mikoyan-Gurevich from the Sukhoi bureau and developed a new multifunctional long-range interceptor designated Type 7.01 (sometimes written as MiG-701). The new plane had all the features of Type 301/321 but with a step towards simplification in the form of delta wings instead of variable-sweep ones.

Most importantly although the position of the engines and the overall layout of the aircraft were retained the idea of a combined turbojet/ramjet engine was dropped. The Type 7.01 was supposed to have a maximum speed of just 2500 kilometers per hour (1550 mph) which was deemed sufficient to completely replace the MiG-31 in its long-range role.



Rough blueprint of Type 7.01 (Image: Testpilot.ru)

The mind-bogglingly high speed was actually unnecessary thanks to the advancement of air-to-air missiles. Steps towards the next-generation armament were already undertaken with MiG-31: in the mid-80s its main missile the R-33 was developed into the R-37 with twice the range (up to 300 kilometers) twice the speed (up to Mach 6) and a new radar. There also were several prototypes of MiG-31D modified to carry a rocket that could reach a low-earth orbit for either shooting down or deploying satellites.

With such weaponry and a new radar the new aircraft on the basis of the Type 7.01 would constitute a proud successor to the MiG-25 and MiG-31 family surpassing them in capabilities without a radical increase in speed which would require equally radical advancement in technology.

But the project came too late: the 80s gave way to the 90s the Soviet Union crumbled and all the ambitious projects went with it. The 7.01 was officially closed in the mid-90s but not before some consideration to turn it into a supersonic business jet."

Tommie Smith who won gold in the 200 meters at the 1968 Summer Games is being portrayed on one side of the cereal box with fist raised and on the other side in full sprint.

""As a world champion I always wanted to be on a Wheaties box"" the 76-year-old Smith said in a statement released by the retail food giant. ""To now be recognized by Wheaties and selected to grace the cover of their box in the class with other great champion athletes is an honor.""

Sales from the box will go to the NAACP the nation's longtime defender of civil rights for Black Americans. Advance sales began Friday online for shipment in April. There is no plan to sell the boxes in stores said General Mills spokesman Simon Landon.

""While Tommie was a world champion runner his work as one of the original activist athletes laid the foundation for champions to use their platform and stand for something extraordinary"" Wheaties executive Taylor Gessell said in a statement released by General Mills.

After winning the 200-meter final in Mexico City Smith made the Black Power salute upon receiving his gold medal while Team USA teammate John Carlos did the same from the bronze medal spot on the awards podium.

The gesture cost both men dearly. There were death threats and lost financial opportunities for years.

Smith explained in a 2008 interview with Smithsonian magazine ""We had to be seen because we couldn't be heard.""

Under the banner of ""Breakfast of Champions"" Wheaties has been honoring athletes with their images on boxes since 1934 starting with New York Yankees legend Lou Gehrig.

Before we get started let's get something straight: There's never a bad time to eat at Olive Garden. (I mean have you tried their breadsticks? How can you ever say no to those?) But as it turns out the Italian-themed chain has some untold truths you might not know about. For starters did you know that General Mills (yes the cereal company) is responsible for creating Olive Garden? And have you heard about the Olive Garden Culinary Institute of Tuscany? (Yup it's a real thing.) And what about the fact that they don't salt the water before boiling their pasta? (Enter unanimous *gasp* here.) And for the Swifties and Olive Garden enthusiasts out there there's a reason Taylor Swift chose to sing about Olive Garden in her song ""No Body No Crime"" on her Evermore album: The restaurant is even a hit with hitmakers.

Evidently there's more to Olive Garden than just delicious breadsticks which is why we're here to dish out the secret to getting the best bang for your buck during your next visit.

GM didn’t say that at all but reporting on EVs has never been a strong point for most media outlets.

GM said in its press release it “aspires” to eliminate tailpipe emissions and sell only zero-emission light-duty vehicles by 2035 in a press release headlining its plans to be fully carbon-neutral by 2040. That’s a goal not a commitment. The New York Times got it wrong headlining the story “GM will only sell zero-emission vehicles by 2035.” The technology site TechCrunch said GM “committed to have a fully electric fleet of vehicles by 2035.” And so on. To his credit Reuters’ longtime auto correspondent David Shepardson nailed it from the start saying GM “aims to” end sales of gasoline and diesel vehicles by 2035.

GM CEO Mary Barra. GM

It’s reminiscent of Volvo’s July 2017 pledge to electrify all new models widely misreported as “Volvo will build only electric cars starting in 2019.” The term “electrified” carries a lot of nuance that often gets lost. There it meant all new models would offer either electric or plug-in hybrid versions. That’s a long way from “all EVs.” But entreaties to reporters to read more carefully went unheeded as they were already onto the next story.

GM’s release included other implicit caveats: The aspiration applies only to light-duty vehicles meaning passenger cars and trucks up to 6000 pounds. It does not include “heavy-duty” versions of full-size pickup trucks for instance whose luxury versions have proven surprisingly popular and very profitable. Also it may not include just electric cars but also hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles though it shows no signs of developing cars in the latter category for personal transport.

There are many reasons GM’s hopes could be realized though multiple challenges would have to be overcome. The vehicles may be the least of them. Others include consumer explanation and education; the perennial problem of uninformed disinterested or downright deceptive salespeople; confusion over how EVs are charged (there are several ways); and the need for a visible recognized DC fast-charging infrastructure.

GM’s “aspiration” is nothing more than a statement of direction. To make it real the company has to prove it can design compelling EVs in the highest-volume segments. They likely must be better than gasoline equivalents and cost-competitive. And it must reeducate American drivers writ large—which may be harder yet.

The upcoming Bolt EUV. GM

Many people and companies aspire to many things. I aspire to get back in shape after a year of mostly isolation for instance. Whether it actually happens is a very different story.

Tens of billions of dollars

Still most people see or hear or view something assume it’s true without thinking too much or checking sources and then react. On Thursday some of them heard GM wouldn’t make vehicles with engines anymore and the usual clamorous alarm went off—especially among truck bros. (That’s a wholly different story.)

GM executives very much want Wall Street analysts and the public to believe the company is resetting itself to become a global leader in the EV transition of the 2020s and 2030s. That transition was kicked off in 2012 by a brash upstart California company that’s now the world’s most valuable automaker.

GM is investing tens of billions of dollars into new plants products and technologies to produce EVs in volume—cash it earns on highly profitable sales of gasoline and diesel full-size trucks and SUVs of many sizes. It is building a billion-dollar joint-venture plant with LG Chem to produce battery cells in high volume for its new Ultium electric-car architecture. (The more impressive announcement will be the next two or three such plants of equal size.)

Last March it showed a dozen different prototypes mockups and designs for electric vehicles it said it plans to build by 2025. The first two will be the 2022 GMC Hummer EV and the 2022 Cadillac Lyriq luxury crossover.

The upcoming Cadillac Lyriq GM

But the company has a long history of starting then abandoning electric-car initiatives. Today it offers only a single EV a competent five-door hatchback that very few shoppers know about understand or buy. The Chevrolet Bolt EV has sold roughly 20000 copies a year since it went on sale nationwide in mid-2017.

That’s nice but it hardly moves the dial when Teslas make up the largest share of almost 2 million EVs on U.S. roads—not to mention the vast bulk of all EV hype.

EVs imminent

GM might respond that it will have the first of the new Ultium vehicles in dealers before the end of this year. That’s the electric Hummer EV an audacious reboot of the notorious Hummer brand killed in GM’s 2010 bankruptcy and government-backed restructuring. The Hummer EV will be pricey and it won’t sell in high numbers. Its mission is to embed in the minds of U.S. drivers and truck owners a hard reset about what an EV can be and do. It has to show EVs can be badass and it’ll probably succeed in that mission.

It’s the company’s entries in high-volume segments that will matter more. It has teased an electric Chevy compact crossover and Chevy Avalanche-like pickup truck both of them in far higher-selling segments than the Hummer EV or Lyriq.

GM

We don’t know anything about those entries yet. The crossovers in particular will have to be priced comparably to the millions of gasoline alternatives and GM will be playing catch-up with the Volkswagen ID.4 Nissan Ariya and entries to be unveiled this year by Hyundai and Kia among others.

Why GM shouldn’t be trusted here

Prototypes product concepts and the rest are fine but the company’s politics only fell into line with its product plan after it became clear Joe Biden would become president. Before that GM had joined with the Trump administration in October 2019 to eviscerate California’s decades-long ability to set its own clean-air rules arguably the single factor that has produced greater reductions in new-car fuel consumption and emissions than any other. That followed its support in 2010 and 2012 for Obama-era CAFÉ rules that reinforced California’s separate standards.

On November 23—after Trump lost it must be noted—GM issued a short press release saying it was switching sides (again) withdrawing from the effort to kill California’s regulatory clout and urging other makers to do the same. The action was a realpolitik response to the California Air Resources Board again becoming a major player in vehicular CO2 emissions reduction rules especially those to be written for 2026 through 2035—a task now squarely in the court of the Biden EPA.

However GM hasn’t joined BMW Ford Honda Volvo and VW Group in the deal they cut with California in mid-2019 over revised fuel economy/emission rules. That agreement extended the Obama standards by one year to 2026.

The challenge is that national emission rules for 2026 through 2035 and beyond do not exist. For automakers who commit hundreds of millions of dollars to new powertrains years before vehicles go into production that void is deeply worrisome.

But times and political postures can change and the auto industry has a decades-long history of viscerally and viciously attacking any attempt to regulate its products business practices and services. A quote from Axios Generate summarized the distrust:

""[H]ow can we trust GM and other automakers’ promises when they repudiated their commitment to abide by the standards they negotiated with Obama?"" asks Dan Becker of the Center for Biological Diversity.

Indeed: As they say trust but verify.

Perspective from the EV1 days

This year is the 25th anniversary of the launch of GM’s EV1 the aerodynamic two-seat EV that showed what a modern electric car might be capable of. As a teenager Chelsea Sexton was part of the Southern California EV1 support team later one of the stars of the documentary Who Killed The Electric Car? She remains an astute EV observer and advocate today.

The EV1 GM

“Announcements are good” she said of GM’s aspirations. “It’s long past time to start adding deadlines to the inevitable following the leadership from CARB and other agencies. But within that time what GM does in the next five years matters far more than what happens in the last five.”

That is to get to a zero-emission lineup in just 15 years GM must sell vastly higher and steadily increasing numbers of EVs between now and 2035—starting this year and ramping up in increments of hundreds of thousands every year. And it will have to explain and educate consumers about those vehicles then market them as compellingly better than gasoline alternatives. That’s something it’s utterly failed to do over the past 10 years: Even after 10 years virtually all EV buyers today arrive in the showroom vastly better informed than the salespeople. That can’t continue if EVs are to become universal.

Sexton also noted GM’s bigger full-size trucks aren’t “light-duty vehicles” at all. The “Heavy Duty” Chevy Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups are considered Class 2 or Class 3 commercial trucks for which different emission rules apply. When high-luxury high-profit 3-ton pickup trucks are used for single-person commuting GM might decide its very profitable full-size truck lines would do just fine if they’re no longer light duty at all. Could even 1500-class full-size pickups get large enough where they became Class 2 or 3 trucks? Stay tuned.

The timing of GM’s new “aspiration” seems rather awkward since its only EV on sale today is a five-year-old small hatchback—far from what most buyers want. The 2035 goal might have been better received if GM’s first new EVs were at least on the road and available for purchase. A year hence with Hummer EVs in dealerships and the Lyriq launch imminent the company could at least have pointed to them (and more EVs to come) as evidence it was walking the walk.

Goals are good but...

But as Sexton suggests GM’s “aspiration” has one very positive benefit: It sets a specific date on the hoped-for transition. Whether or not 100 percent of the company’s light-duty vehicles are zero-emission in 2035 GM has put a stake in the ground.

And it’s a more ambitious stake than that of the other mass-market EV pioneer Nissan. The two companies started selling the first modern EV and plug-in hybrid 10 years ago within days of each other. Arguably both somewhat fumbled their leads: Nissan still sells only the aged Leaf while GM sold two generations of Volt then killed off that technology and now offers only a Bolt EV whose charging is already substandard and will apparently stay that way for years. Both of those things are changing soon but they still put GM and Nissan in a position of playing catch-up.

The electric Nissan Ariya. Nissan

Nissan’s commitment as reported by NHK World is that it will make only hybrids and EVs by 2030. That’s an advance on its current lineup almost entirely powered by gasoline engines but those hybrids won’t have plugs—and will still have tailpipes.

Other countries and regions are going much further than Japan. Numerous European countries will ban the sale of cars that emit CO2 in various years and China has planned since 2017 to do the same though it hasn’t yet specified a year. Closer to home California Gov. Gavin Newsom recently caused a similar ruckus to GM’s in September when he directed the Air Resources Board to study ways to end the sale of new vehicles with tailpipes in the state by 2035.

That too is a concrete goal; it may or may not be met. And having goals is good. But what GM does will be much more important than just what it says—or aspires toward.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDEvMjkvY2xpbWF0ZS9nbS1lbGVjdHJpYy1jYXJzLXBvd2VyLWdyaWQuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Electric Cars Are Coming and Fast. Is the Nation's Grid Up to It? (Published 2021),"Major automakers are increasingly betting that millions of new cars and trucks over the next decade will be plugged into electrical outlets not fueled up at gas stations. That raises a question: Is the nation’s power grid ready to handle this surge of new electric vehicles?

Today fewer than 1 percent of cars on America’s roads are electric. But a seismic shift is underway.

General Motors said Thursday that it aims to stop selling new gasoline-powered cars and light trucks by 2035 and will pivot to battery-powered vehicles. California’s governor has set a goal of phasing out sales of new combustion engines statewide in just 15 years. Automakers like Tesla Ford and Volkswagen plan to introduce dozens of new electric models in the years ahead spurred on by plummeting battery prices and concerns about climate change.

That shift will have sweeping implications for the companies that produce and sell electricity and manage the grid. Analysts generally agree that it is entirely feasible to power many millions of new cars with electricity but it will take careful planning.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlc2lnbm5ld3MuY29tL2F1dG9tb3RpdmUtZW5naW5lZXJpbmcvZ20tZW5naW5lZXItdHJhZGVkLWRyaXZpbmctdGhlLWxhbmUtZm9yLWNhcnMtdGhhdC1kcml2ZS10aGVtc2VsdmVz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GM Engineer Traded Driving the Lane for Cars that Drive Themselves,"While Charles Muse always liked to take things apart to see how they worked he also excelled at sports and that paved the way toward his current job working on future autonomous vehicles at General Motors (GM).

The assistant program engineering manager for autonomous and electric vehicles was a bat boy for the Chicago White Sox while growing up on Chicago’s south side. But it was basketball that got him into a private prep high school where he was able to take STEM classes that intrigued him especially after a trip to an aviation camp.

Basketball also took Muse to The Ohio State University where he was the only African American to graduate in his class of aerospace engineers. While a career in the aviation industry seems like the obvious destination for an aerospace engineer an internship at GM working at the proving grounds rekindled the interest that had led him to customize the Dodge Nitro that Muse drove in college.

“You show up every day and give it 110 percent” he said. “I was doing something I loved.”

He joined the company in 2011 doing aerodynamic work on GM's crossover SUVs. Tall boxy SUVs presented a real engineering headache for someone tasked with minimizing their drag. “We pretty much had car drag requirements for SUVs. The bread and butter of what we do are crossovers and aero is a huge part.”

Related:General Motors Enters Electric Delivery Business

Applying some of the obvious solutions wouldn’t be aesthetically acceptable to SUV customers which limited Muse’s options. “The car still had to be sexy. But they were tall and boxy and all the things that screamed ‘anti aero” he said. “You can’t slam it to the ground and make it look like a Prius.”

Muse’s reward for finding solutions to those problems was to be assigned to run GM’s wind tunnel program. The problem was that GM’s wind tunnel was closed to be upgraded to a rolling road tunnel with a moving ground plane so Muse had to decamp to Georgia to oversee work using Lockheed Martin’s tunnel in Atlanta.

That meant hiring a team to move with him a chore that was complicated by the need for all employees to have a security clearance because the tunnel is located at Dobbins Air Reserve Base.

Then the Lockheed Martin wind tunnel data system didn’t speak General Motors’ language so he had to write code to convert the defense/aerospace data to GM’s protocol. While we have all had to learn new work-from-home practices “work from Georgia” presented huge challenges.

The clay styling models that are normally wheeled from the studio to the tunnel at GM now had to be shipped south. And that had to be climate-controlled transport because the clay model needed to look the same when it got there as when it left and not like a drooping Salvador Dali-inspired version of it.

Along the way Muse has helped parents with their home-bound kids by contributing to GM’s STEM Online Learning YouTube video series mentoring aspiring journalists in the Discover the Unexpected scholarship program and speaking to youth mentorship programs.

Succeeding in these challenges has gotten Muse promoted to his current job where he is responsible for the development validation and service of fully autonomous vehicles for GM’s Cruise Origin project and managing a multimillion-dollar budget to do it.

Muse credits his successes with his recognition at an early age that it is more important for his team to succeed than for him to achieve individual success. “I think a lot it goes back to my time playing basketball” he said. “You can go out and drop 30 (points) but if you lost it doesn’t matter.”

He also reports that he has not experienced any obvious roadblocks to achievement along the way. “I don’t think I’ve experienced being discriminated against” he says. “Everybody has their prejudices” Muse acknowledges. “I try to establish rapport with everybody.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vZ21hdXRob3JpdHkuY29tL2Jsb2cvMjAyMS8wMS9lbXBoYXNpcy1vbi1mb2N1c2VkLXZlaGljbGUtb3JkZXJpbmctaGVscHMtZ20tbmF2aWdhdGUtcGFuZGVtaWMv0gFpaHR0cHM6Ly9nbWF1dGhvcml0eS5jb20vYmxvZy8yMDIxLzAxL2VtcGhhc2lzLW9uLWZvY3VzZWQtdmVoaWNsZS1vcmRlcmluZy1oZWxwcy1nbS1uYXZpZ2F0ZS1wYW5kZW1pYy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Emphasis On Focused Vehicle Ordering Helps GM Navigate Pandemic,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://gmauthority.com/blog/2021/01/emphasis-on-focused-vehicle-ordering-helps-gm-navigate-pandemic/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vZ21hdXRob3JpdHkuY29tL2Jsb2cvMjAyMS8wMS9lbXBoYXNpcy1vbi1mb2N1c2VkLXZlaGljbGUtb3JkZXJpbmctaGVscHMtZ20tbmF2aWdhdGUtcGFuZGVtaWMv0gFpaHR0cHM6Ly9nbWF1dGhvcml0eS5jb20vYmxvZy8yMDIxLzAxL2VtcGhhc2lzLW9uLWZvY3VzZWQtdmVoaWNsZS1vcmRlcmluZy1oZWxwcy1nbS1uYXZpZ2F0ZS1wYW5kZW1pYy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

An expert panel “concluded that remdesivir has no meaningful effect on mortality or on other important outcomes for patients such as the need for mechanical ventilation or time to clinical improvement” the W.H.O. announced. The panel published its review in the journal The BMJ. The report did not rule out the use of the drug altogether as a Covid treatment but said evidence was lacking to recommend its use.

Gilead Sciences manufacturer of remdesivir whose trade name is Veklury said in a statement that its drug “is recognized as a standard of care for the treatment of hospitalized patients with Covid-19 in guidelines from numerous credible national organizations including the U.S. National Institutes of Health and Infectious Diseases Society of America Japan U.K. and Germany.” It added that there are “multiple randomized controlled studies published in peer-reviewed journals that demonstrate the clinical benefits of Veklury.”

The potential utility of remdesivir had been the subject of debate and skepticism for months and especially in recent weeks after the Food and Drug Administration approved it as the first treatment for Covid-19 in late October. One large study sponsored by the National Institutes of Health found that the drug reduced recovery time in hospitalized patients from 15 to 11 days.

In a new journal article published in Science research by Blake Alexander Simmons Rebecca Ray Hongbo Yang and Kevin P. Gallagher explores opportunities for China to alleviate debt burdens in exchange for debtor nation commitments to climate change mitigation and/or adaptation and environmental protection through “debt-for-climate” and “debt-for-nature” swaps.

Many developing countries are experiencing mounting external debt distress owing to the economic consequences of COVID-19. G20 Finance Ministers were swift to adopt the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI) in 2020 suspending bilateral debt payments for 73 low-income countries through July 2021. For the 46 participating DSSI countries thus far payments due to China constitute 68 percent ($8.4 billion) of all official bilateral payments originally due by the end of 2020. G20 countries have now come to realize that they will need to go beyond debt suspension to include the cancellation of some portion of debt. Without substantial debt relief developing countries will face pressure to exploit natural capital to pay short-term debt placing conservation and climate change ambitions aside.

It is therefore of paramount importance to align debt restructuring efforts with climate biodiversity and development goals. Although China has only recently become a major creditor it has already built a strong record of bilateral debt relief and has begun to advocate for linking biodiversity climate change and international finance.

This article identifies the countries that would benefit from participating in debt-for-climate or debt-for-nature swaps with China— including Angola Cambodia Laos Myanmar Senegal Sudan Zimbabwe Fiji Togo Pakistan Cameroon Ethiopia and the Solomon Islands based on their exposure to significant levels of Chinese debt and threats to their climate and biodiversity. The authors also explain why participating in such swaps would benefit China and cement its status as a global leader on climate.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vZW4uY3J5cHRvbm9taXN0LmNoLzIwMjEvMDEvMzEvZWxyb25kLWxhdW5jaC1tYWlhci13YWxsZXQtZ2xvYmFsLXBheW1lbnRzLWFwcC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Elrond announces the official launch of the Maiar wallet and global payments app,"PRESS RELEASE

Elrond the european blockchain startup that has surpassed a market valuation of $800 million in under 3 years is ready to open the path to onboarding next billion users through Maiar a blockchain payment app that provides a more secure private and inexpensive alternative to apps such as Paypal Google Pay or Revolut.

Maiar is the mobile wallet and global payments app that will use the Elrond blockchain’s internet-scale performance scaling beyond 100000 transactions per second to reimagine how people interact with money assets titles of ownership or any value transfer for that matter.

“Money is humanity’s best attempt at making fungible something that fundamentally is not: our time. We have built Maiar to help you take it back.” said Beniamin Mincu Elrond CEO.

The advantages of blockchain technology are still out of reach for the vast majority of internet users who are waiting for a gateway that is intuitive easy to use and has features that are similar or better than current popular money apps. This is why Maiar using nothing but a smartphone will open a new wave of rapid adoption to a high bandwidth and low latency global financial system.

“Billions of people are able to send direct messages to their contacts because it’s convenient intuitive and inexpensive.” said Beniamin Mincu Elrond CEO. “Maiar and the Elrond blockchain now offer them the same experience when it comes to sending money.”

With a deep care for the user an elegant design and an intuitive interface Maiar enables any phone user to get a working wallet in seconds. The mobile phone app enables anyone to send money to their phone contacts or better still register @herotags as aliases for their wallets which they can use to send money across the world near instantly at a negligible cost – all with the tap of a single button.

By adding key innovations like progressive security and gamification around its most important features Maiar will provide a new and compelling experience for the internet of money.

More than 200000 users have signed up for early Maiar access. They and people everywhere in the world* are now able to download the future of money on their mobile phones from the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.

Everything you need to know about Elrond

Elrond is the internet-scale blockchain designed from scratch to bring a 1000-fold cumulative improvement in throughput and execution speed. To achieve this Elrond introduces two key innovations: a novel Adaptive State Sharding mechanism and a Secure Proof of Stake (PoS) algorithm enabling linear scalability with a fast efficient and secure consensus mechanism. Thus Elrond can process upwards of 15000 transactions per second (TPS) with 6-second latency and negligible cost attempting to become the backbone of a permissionless borderless globally accessible internet economy.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpbmV4dHJhLmNvbS9ibG9ncG9zdGluZy8xOTgyMC9mYXN0LWFuZC1lYXN5LWFkZHJlc3Npbmctc3lzdGVt0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,FAST and Easy Addressing System,"Realtime payments have been a hot topic in payments world for the last two decades. It’s because even if the current RTGS systems allow the funds to be transferred between parties they do not finalize the transaction in realtime which is a critical need in todays world as the daily life is becoming faster and payment relations need immidiate results in order to continue the business.

The first known instant payment system ( they all more or less refer to the same thing: instant payment system realtime payment system immediate payment system faster payment system) is launched in South Korea in 2001. Since than a lot of country all around the world have developed and started operating realtime payment systems.

As a result of the technological changes and digitalisation cash usage is diminishing gradually. This trend is not only valid for Turkey it is global fact and there are countries where cashless transactions have reached and passed the ratio of the cash based transactions. It is needless to say that Covid 19 pandemic became a catalysor to this trend.

Digital payments require immediate confirmations by its nature. It is achieved in card payments since there is a special setup and arrangements for this goal. Although the financial money movement takes place with a 1 or 2 days latency the merchant or the peer knows that the payment is guaranteed and continues the business. But when it comes to account based ACH payments there is a gap between the order given for a payment to take place and movements of funds between the payer and the payee. This gap can be tolerable for some type of business relations but on the other hand it is not an efficient way for some other businesses.

Source: https://www.mastercard.us/content/dam/mccom/en-us/business-payments/documents/real-time-payments-whitepaper-sept-2018.pdf

Account based realtime payments is a solution given to those businesses and people who need this functionality for their daily life. It is 24/7/365. If the payer and the payee are within the same network (say have accounts at the same bank or payment institution) immediate and uninterrupted payment is always possible. But when they are customers of different entities there is need for a central authority to process and settle the payments between the payer and the payee’s agents. Here we see the realtime payment systems coming into the picture.

Turkey used to be credit card dominant market but we see that debit card usage is gaining market share gradually and constantly. That means that cardholders are now willing to pay from their checking account rather than the credit account.

Source : https://bkm.com.tr/raporlar-ve-yayinlar/donemsel-bilgiler/

There is no difference between an account to account payment and payment with a debit card from a cardholders perspective (Only difference that is worth to mention could be the chargeback protection given by the card schemes) In both cases payment is done from the balance of the checking account. The ease of using card as a means of payment is always higher . So if you make Account to Account Payments as easy as card payments people will choose it. Of course only infrastructure is not sufficient there must be systems and products designed to use that channel as payment method.

The Central Bank of the Repoublic of Turkey has announced (CBRT) that a new retail payment system called Instant and Continuous Transfer of Funds (FAST) is becoming functionable by 8th of January 2020 after a pilot phase and with 50 TRY as a starting limit which will be increased to 1.000 TRY gradually according to the usage.

Together with FAST a proxy payment solution called Easy Addressing System (KOLAS) is also being launched. With this system telephone numbers ID numbers or e-mail addresses can be used as proxies instead of long and hard to remember IBAN. Infrastructure is hosted by BKM.

In a proxy payment system standardized IBAN is being used in background and customers does not need to remember or type long numbers as they use unique proxies that are special to them and can not be owned by anybody else.

A team of economists affiliated with the University of Maryland Harvard University and Koç University in Turkey recently published a study about the potentially disastrous consequences emphasizing both economic and moral imperatives for increasing worldwide access to COVID-19 vaccines. The authors of the study (which was commissioned by the International Chamber of Commerce) found that unequal vaccine access among countries will likely lead to a “total cost for the world” between $1.8 trillion and $3.8 trillion with up to half the losses paid for by wealthier nations. In contrast the cost of vaccinating one-fifth of the world’s vulnerable population as the World Health Organization’s COVAX initiative aims to do would cost less than forty billion dollars with expenses decreasing over time.

I recently spoke over Zoom with Selva Demiralp and Muhammed A. Yildirim two of the paper’s authors. Demiralp a professor of economics at Koç University previously worked at the Federal Reserve Board in Washington D.C. Yildirim is an assistant professor at Koç University and an associate at the Center for International Development at Harvard. During our conversation which has been edited for length and clarity we discussed the biggest problems the global economy will face if poor countries go unvaccinated why certain government efforts to prevent economic collapse have worked better than others and why policymakers don’t always plan well for the future.

Equitable distribution of vaccines across countries is important for reasons of fairness and human decency but why is it important for the self-interest of wealthier nations?

Muhammed A. Yildirim: Let me say that I think the moral argument is the most important argument but moral arguments sometimes don’t work. We still have a lot of poverty in the world. We still have all the things that we are dealing with like global warming and so forth. But putting that aside we are living in this super interconnected world right? So everything that we do any item that we use some parts come from China some parts come from Mexico and everything is co-integrated and gives us the products that we use every day. So as economists we simplify; we try to understand how this works. So we divide these types of interactions into categories.

The first category is final goods: the iPhone that we use as consumers or computers that we use or the bar of soap that we use in our everyday life. When it comes to also making these final goods there are a lot of intermediate skills that are exchanged between countries and industries. And those are also affected. Because if Turkey is experiencing the pandemic let’s say and the United States is not and Turkish workers are experiencing sickness and so forth what would happen is that Turkish workers would not be able to make the intermediate inputs needed for the U.S. industries to be used in their final products.

On the other hand Turkey also makes some final products. And those also use intermediate inputs from the United States. American producers wouldn’t be able to send their intermediate inputs to Turkey. But this is not just two countries; this is happening globally. So if you treat this disease in advanced countries only because of the trade relationships the advanced economies will still be affected tremendously. So that’s the bottom line of the paper. Even without the moral argument if you’re thinking about this in terms of return on your investment it makes sense to do this investment of vaccinating other nations.

Selva Demiralp: As economists when we make decisions we compare the costs with the benefits. So in the paper we calculate the costs of inequitable distribution of vaccines. And under certain assumptions—and suppose we say advanced economies are vaccinated in half a year and emerging markets can only vaccinate half of their population by the end of the year—in this scenario we find that total global costs can be as high as $3.8 trillion. And advanced economies due to the links that Muhammed mentioned bear about fifty per cent of this. So then what we are comparing is if you contribute to something like COVAX and enable two billion doses of vaccines you just need twenty-seven billion dollars more. But if you don’t and you allow the rest of the world to suffer and let the pandemic drag down their economies then advanced economies are going to face something close to two trillion dollars. So when you compare twenty-seven billion dollars with something close to two trillion dollars then the decision is trivial for an economist—you should actually invest in this COVAX initiative and avoid paying a higher toll down the road.

I think the way many people perceive the relationship between richer countries and poorer countries now is that poorer countries produce goods that rich countries then consume in some way. Why is this too simplistic?

S.D.: Clearly the relationship is much more complicated. Rich countries also have export relationships. They produce and sell to emerging markets so if emerging markets are still suffering from the pandemic because their income levels are low they won’t be able to afford those goods from advanced economies. So advanced economies won’t be able to sell those exports to emerging markets. That’s one channel plus advanced economies also import intermediate goods from emerging markets; you use those goods in order to produce your final good. So if Turkey produces steel which is imported by America to produce a car and if Turkey is suffering from the pandemic there are lockdowns and we cannot produce that steel. Then the United States won’t be able to produce the final product which is the car. So American production is going to decline because of the ongoing pandemic in Turkey.

M.A.Y.: We looked at the industrial costs in the advanced economies and emerging markets and compared them. The most affected sectors are the manufacturing sectors because they need the imports from the other countries. So it’s not the case that supply chains were simply divided into raw materials versus final goods or that emerging markets were providing the cheap goods. It has become so much more interconnected in the last twenty years or so. So when we look at the results at the industrial level in the advanced economies it’s the manufacturing sectors that get affected the most. In the emerging markets it’s the service sectors because in the emerging markets owing to the ongoing pandemic people still cannot go to a restaurant.

S.D.: In the paper we look at the sector of costs ranked from the lowest to highest for advanced economies and emerging markets in our hypothetical scenario assuming that advanced economies get the vaccine and emerging markets don’t. The story in emerging markets is very similar to the story that we lived through in 2020 all around the world. We have seen how the services sector collapsed because people are avoiding consuming services that require close proximity.

We say that in 2021 if emerging markets don’t receive the vaccination the same story is going to repeat for them. But for advanced economies their trade exposure to emerging markets is going to be proportional to their exposure to unvaccinated emerging markets. So the more a particular sector either buys or sells goods to a sector from an emerging market then the higher the costs borne by the particular sector are going to be.

Which sectors in advanced economies generally are most central to what you’re talking about?

S.D.: Agriculture and fishing wholesale and retail manufacturing or basic metals: these are the top three most severely affected sectors for advanced economies. And if we dig down to look at what causes that we see that their exposure to unvaccinated countries is higher compared with the other sectors.

We’ve now had the pandemic for almost a year. Most people around the world have not been vaccinated even in rich countries and we’ve seen a global economic shock. But at least in the United States and in most of Europe there aren’t shortages of goods that I’m aware of. You can still buy what you bought before. What have governments done over the past ten months to prevent these shocks to the supply chain that you’re talking about?"

Chief among them was Hall of Fame manager Tommy Lasorda who wanted nothing more than to watch his favorite team win. Lasorda got his wish but unfortunately passed away at the age of 93 shortly after being released from the hospital.

He was a Dodgers lifer in every sense spending more than seven decades with the organization. “First and foremost it speaks to the relationship that he had with the Dodgers” manager Dave Roberts said of Lasorda’s legacy.

“The continuity that the Dodgers have always prided themselves on. Tommy was great on the field as a leader he was great off the field in the community an advocate of baseball not only in America but beyond.

“As he talked about representing the U.S. in the Olympics was one of his proudest moments. I do think Tommy like many great leaders just took it one day at a time. And all he cared about was the Dodgers and winning and pouring into players.

“You look at his whole body of work it’s 20 years managing the Dodgers and two world championships. He just did a great job of putting his head down and doing it the right way.”

Roberts had developed a close relationship with Lasorda over the years often crossing paths at Spring Training and Dodger Stadium. He detailed a conversation they had shortly after the club won the World Series.

“Just a quick little embrace some tears and just kind of we did it. Just elation. I was so happy he was there” Roberts said. “The Dodgers made it possible and it wouldn’t have been complete without him there.”

By leading the Dodgers to their first World Series title since 1988 Roberts joined a prestigious group that includes Lasorda and Walter Alston. “I can’t speak for either of those two gentlemen but it represents an entire organization” Roberts said.

“It takes a lot to accomplish that. But I think that anytime you can be in the conversation as two Hall of Fame managers you’ve got to be doing something right. So for me it’s quite the accomplishment.

“Now going forward I’m just really intent on keeping his legacy alive with how he did things and what he meant to the Dodgers organization.”

Dodgers planning to honor Lasorda during 2021 season

Dodgers CEO and president Stan Kasten recently revealed the organization will honor Lasorda in some capacity during the 2021 season. “Don’t know yet but obviously we’ll do something prominent” Kasten said.

“I would think the first thing is a patch on jerseys. You can count on us having a fair amount of programming Opening Day and many days thereafter honoring Tommy in a way he deserves to be honored as one of the all-time great and most memorable Dodgers of all-time.”

LeVert is considered a rising star a 26-year-old premium scorer who needed his own team to shine. That wasn’t going to happen in Brooklyn.

The league shouldn’t move on from the Caris LeVert injury. In fact it should serve as a warning to NBA teams and a blessing to LeVert that the Pacers were diligent in his physical examination following the James Harden trade.

When a player gets injured or misses time the NBA moves on. It did when Kevin Durant missed a full season. It did when Paul George and Stephen Curry and Victor Oladipo missed significant time.

But something happened on the way to LeVert become Indiana’s next All-Star. His physical found a spot on his kidney and it was a major concern.

The Pacers did not call off the trade — the Nets added money into the deal — and Indiana not only decided to keep LeVert but ensure he got the best medical care. On Tuesday the team announced in a brief statement that LeVert had surgery to treat renal cell carcinoma. LeVert is expected to make a full recovery and return to the court.

The Pacers understand that LeVert may not return until next season but the question begs to be asked: What if there was no Harden trade and LeVert kept playing with a cancerous kidney?

“It’s been some trying times for myself and my family” LeVert said before the surgery. “From being traded to finding out the news about my body. I’m very grateful for such support I’ve received. It’s definitely been a crazy couple of days. It’s going to be a crazy recovery as well but I think myself and the Pacers organization is really optimistic about the future.”

LeVert is expected to make a full return and the diagnosis was a testament to some of the sophisticated medical issues even the finest-conditioned athletes have. LeVert said he had no symptoms. He did not miss a game with the Nets this season. Yet he was playing with a kidney that needed surgery.

“The most important thing is to get my body healthy and live a long life” he said. “Making sure I’m good health-wise is most important. I’ve been through a lot not only with basketball but life in general. It was tough news to get but it could always be worse. I didn’t have any symptoms. I was playing in games. I was 100 percent healthy. This trade could have possibly saved me.”

The Pacers could have rescinded the trade but didn’t. Team president Kevin Pritchard said LeVert was sought-after for years and when they found his condition could be treated they stuck to their convictions.

“We huddled 50 times with our doctors and we’re comfortable with it” Pritchard said. “Modern medicine is incredible. We felt like there is an opportunity to tell a great story and have a great story. We look at character. Character means a lot for us. There were some moments where we could have bowed out said no chance. [Owner Herb Simon] stuck in there and said ‘Let’s see this through.’ ”

Said LeVert: “I didn’t know if the trade was going to go through but it did and that’s a testament to the organization.”

The hope is LeVert turns into a franchise cornerstone. Pritchard said he saw an opportunity to acquire a rising star in exchange for a player who made intimations that he wanted out in Oladipo.

“This was a very unique trade; it had its ups and downs” Pritchard said. “This organization is going to step up help him through this and we’re super confident that we’re going to have him on the court. We’ve had him on our radar for a long time. We’ve tried to get him in the past.”

LeVert said that a physical that was originally meant to examine his back and knees caught the affected kidney.

“This does not get found out until a detailed physical happened” Pritchard said. “I got two texts from doctors and they told me they had never seen a kid as optimistic and ready to jump in it and get it taken care of.”

A very bad spell for Wizards

Bradley Beal is leading the NBA in scoring but the Wizards are 3-12 and have the worst record in the league. Nick Wass/Associated Press

The best way to describe the Wizards season so far is disastrous. When the team acquired Russell Westbrook for John Wall last month it was supposed to result in a legitimate playoff run for a franchise that hasn’t been to the conference finals in 42 years.

The rebuilding years in Washington were supposed to be over with Westbrook and Bradley Beal catapulting the team to respectability. Instead the Wizards have been besieged with COVID-19 cases Westbrook has been erratic at best and Beal is putting up big numbers — in big losses.

Beal is averaging an obscene 34.7 points per game but the Wizards are a league-worst 3-12 and Beal is beginning to show major disappointment after each loss. When the Wizards faced the Rockets on Tuesday with Wall angry at his former team and wanting to prove the trade was a mistake Houston pulled away to a 19-point victory in the final four minutes.

The next night in New Orleans Beal scored 47 points and the Wizards lost by 18 points. The issue is Beal has been greatly let down by his supporting cast.

Westbrook is averaging a near triple-double (18.9 points 9.3 rebounds 9.6 assists) but is shooting a career-low 38.1 percent from the field. The issue is Westbrook can no longer shoot or finish like he once did. He is shooting 39.7 percent on 2-point shots. By comparison Westbrook shot 51.4 percent from 2-point range last season.

When Westbrook can’t consistently score at the rim or shoot jumpers more pressure is on Beal. Also Westbrook is still playing carelessly — 5.0 turnovers per game — which would be the most in the NBA if he qualified.

Also the Wizards had seven consecutive games postponed because of players in COVID-19 protocol which has hampered development. This was supposed to be a breakout season for second-year forward Rui Hachimura but he’s played in just half of the games. Davis Bertans who signed a lucrative extension is supposed to be the team’s 3-point marksman but he is shooting just 33.7 percent from beyond the arc.

The Wizards were able to acquire former lottery pick Jerome Robinson (a former Boston College standout) and draft Troy Brown but neither are consistently in coach Scott Brooks’s rotation. So the Wizards have essentially become Beal and the Disappointments.

Brooks is on the coaching hot seat but it would be unfair to make a move now because the team has been riddled with COVID-19 cases. Yet changes have to be made.

Beal is contractually obligated to the Wizards through the 2021-22 season with a player option at $37 million for 2022-23. He is obviously the team’s most tradable asset but also the most valuable. The Wizards moved Wall because they wanted Beal to be the franchise centerpiece.

But the centerpiece is visibly unhappy and the Wizards may have to respond by completely starting over.

FLIP THIS TEAM

Nothing working for T’Wolves

Karl-Anthony Towns and the Timberwolves have the worst record in the Western Conference. Rick Bowmer/Associated Press

With the No. 1 overall pick to add to another former No. 1 pick and second overall pick the Timberwolves appeared to be ready to compete in the Western Conference. Instead they are the worst team in the West and there appears to be no sign of progress.

General manager Gersson Rosas did not hire Ryan Saunders as coach so questions will begin percolating about Saunders’s status. Saunders was a sentimental choice as he is the son of the late Flip Saunders the most successful coach in franchise history.

Yet Ryan Saunders is 40-84 with the Timberwolves and the team continues to serve as one of the league’s biggest disappointments.

At first the combination of Karl-Anthony Towns and Andrew Wiggins didn’t work so Wiggins was moved to Golden State last summer February in exchange for former No. 2 pick D’Angelo Russell. That was supposed to be the modern-day version of Stephon Marbury and Kevin Garnett. Instead the Timberwolves are 7-24 since that tandem was put together.

Towns has played in just four games this season because of a hand injury and COVID-19 and it’s understandable that he hasn’t been the same player since the devastating loss of his mother to the coronavirus. But the team has a whole appears to be a bunch of thrown-together pieces with little cohesion. Recent No. 1 overall pick Anthony Edwards has had highlight-reel moments but is also shooting just 35.7 percent from the field.

Meanwhile players such as Jarrett Culver Josh Okogie and Ricky Rubio were expected to make a major impact but haven’t added to winning. It’s highly unlikely that merely the return of Towns will turn the Timberwolves into a respectable franchise.

They are in the bottom 10 in the NBA in scoring field goal percentage and 3-point percentage and they are also in the bottom 10 in those categories defensively. So if the Timberwolves aren’t good defensively or offensively how can they win?

And how long can the 34-year-old Saunders keep his job when the organization isn’t making progress? The Timberwolves believed winning the draft lottery would be the beginning of an organization ascension but it’s done nothing but add another talented player to a team filled with them but nothing to show for it.

ETC.

Uneasy in New Orleans

Lonzo Ball right is averaging 12.9 points per game for the Pelicans this season. Rick Bowmer/Associated Press

Wasn’t Stan Van Gundy supposed to be the answer to all of the Pelicans’ issues? They are still poor defensively and the duo of Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram aren’t getting much help.

With a fully healthy Williamson and Ingram coming off a maximum contract extension and Most Improved Player Award the Pelicans were expected to take off. Even though they sent away Jrue Holiday in a four-team trade they were able to get Oklahoma City strongman Steven Adams in return to stabilize the center position.

But the Pelicans lost 8 of 11 games allowing at least 111 points in each defeat. So what’s the problem? Like the Timberwolves the Pelicans have the talent but lack cohesion and that has resulted in losses to average teams such as Oklahoma City and Charlotte (at home) and back-to-back losses at Utah followed by a loss at Minnesota.

The issue is a lack of a dependable third scorer — Eric Bledsoe has taken that role — while injuries and inconsistency have stopped Lonzo Ball from making the expected impact. Meanwhile veteran J.J. Redick has dipped as a 3-point shooter (29.8 percent). Redick is in the final year of his contract at $13 million and teams have been inquiring about his services.

The Celtics have a $28.5 million trade exception and could add a first-round pick or some second-rounders to get Redick out of New Orleans. But the pressure is on the franchise to take the next step especially with two of the league’s rising stars in Williamson and Ingram.

The problem is the players the Pelicans received in return for Anthony Davis haven’t developed. Ball has been injured and uneven. Josh Hart is a role player. Van Gundy is known for his inventive offenses but he convinced management he could help the team improve drastically on defense. But the Van Gundy Pelicans and the Alvin Gentry Pelicans are pretty much alike. They are entertaining teams with star power but lack the savvy and fortitude to win games late. Van Gundy 61 was an interesting choice for a young team because he’s an older coach who was considered a retread and his four-year stint in Detroit was a failure.

Instead of hiring a first-time coach or younger lead man to relate to younger players Van Gundy won the job because he interviewed well which wasn’t a surprise. But the Pelicans need to make a significant step soon and that could be near impossible in the competitive Western Conference.

Layups

The Spurs will get a boost with the return of Derrick White who has been limited to one game this season because of a fractured toe. The Spurs went into the weekend tied for fourth in the West and were coming off impressive home wins over the Celtics and Nuggets. San Antonio has reshaped itself with younger wings such as Keldon Johnson and Lonnie Walker and White will fill a backcourt role that could turn them into a sleeper in the conference . . . Former Celtic Isaiah Thomas has decided to join Team USA in his quest to return to the NBA. It’s a perfect vehicle for Thomas to prove he can still contribute after having hip issues the past few years. Thomas maintains that his latest procedure has eliminated the pain and he can get back to the form that made him a two-time All-Star with the Celtics. NBA teams have been resistant to sign Thomas because of his injury history. There are a handful of players such as Jamal Crawford J.R. Smith and Dion Waiters waiting for calls from teams. The league has been resistant about expanding rosters from 17 to 18 players because there is concern that adding a spot would create a competitive imbalance favoring teams who are not hard-capped . . . We want to offer blessings and farewell to the great Sekou Smith one of the top NBA reporters in the country and a close friend who died this past week because of complications from COVID-19. Smith was one of the reporters who spent time in the bubble and it was a joy to spend time on a daily basis with a dude who was so funny and had such basketball acumen. All of the reporters who spent time in the bubble developed a bond because of the sacrifices made. Smith made the time in the bubble more enjoyable and the accolades he’s received since his tragic passing have been well-deserved. NBA reporters have a pretty deep brother and sisterhood and Smith was a center part of that bond. Take care of yourself and your family because COVID-19 is serious and can be devastating.

What inspired you to write this book?

This story has been a part of my life since the age of 5 when I first peeked inside my father’s tin bread box while we lived on Saipan in 1955-1957. Even then I partially sensed “voids” that led to questions about my family’s unusual life. How was it possible to piece together the contents or did I simply have an overactive child’s imagination?

These sensations did not dominate my childhood which was wonderful — filled with travel exploration and joy. Rather they were random and episodic taking decades for me to begin to piece together. Yet what did those items stored within dad’s tin bread box represent? A few were recognizable even then but far from most. Why did dad have them and why did the tin bread box travel with us?

As I grew up I repeated my secret explorations of the contents within the box. Answers were elusive creating more questions creating a more complex mosaic of overlaying data that further nurtured a curious sense of greater unknowns. The few times I’d asked my father a general question including “What did you do during WWII?” he replied “I worked with a group in England nothing at all interesting.” In hindsight if he provided an answer it was cleverly and subtly deflected. Direct questions were laughed off and conversations moved effortlessly along.

“Scholars of Mayhem” is a personal detailed non-fiction account of my father’s first secret mission in Nazi-occupied France — the beginning of his remarkable clandestine life. This five-month secret mission changed my father’s life dramatically. He had subsequent missions some of which remain classified to this day. His WWII-era operations were with agencies who purposefully destroyed files and documents shortly after the end of World War II. I am fortunate that dad’s tin bread box sitting next to me now is complete with extensive notes writings diaries silk maps photographs and memorabilia to be overlayed with archival records and a number of personal interviews completed between 1998 and 2010.

Dad’s story unfolded slowly almost as if he was learning how to verbalize long-unspoken events. Daniel Guiet author of “Scholars of Mayhem”

Once his first mission was largely declassified in 1998 a remarkable story of survival loss courage sacrifice and terror emerged — five relentless months operating in the midst of Nazi-occupied France. Dad’s story unfolded slowly almost as if he was learning how to verbalize long-unspoken events. His organized perfectionist mind compartmentalized easily burying those secrets deep within him for more than 60 years. When a series of coincidental events occurred in the late 1990s the floodgates were opened bringing to light his team members mission sacrifices and accomplishments.

French-born Jean Claude Guiet became an agent by happenstance when he was recruited as a freshman at Harvard by Wild Bill Donovan’s top-secret group OSS — Office of Strategic Services. Dad was a privileged sheltered 18-year-old who dreamt of becoming more “American.” Upon completion of his OSS training he was immediately shipped out to Britain and their elite SOE — Special Operations Executive group. SOE formed the basis after WWII of Ian Fleming’s real-life foundation for his James Bond stories. Fleming had served as a junior British Naval Intelligence Officer during the War.

In early 1944 unknown to my father he was being rushed through SOE’s advanced commando and spy craft training having already been secretly selected to be attached to a veteran team of three hardened well-tested experienced agents to undertake a critical mission in Nazi-occupied France. SOE did not anticipate they’d survive. They were required to volunteer and were provided an L-pill – L for lethal – to be swallowed in the event of capture. SOE training was the most advanced commando and spy craft training that existed anywhere in the world. These select women and men of SOE became the very “Tip of the Spear.”

His first mission was just the beginning of a clandestine career ranging from Nazi-occupied France to the jungles of China and Burma throughout the South Pacific and Orient to urban D.C. and elsewhere around the globe. My sister and I never knew our family was part of his cover story until decades later – yet we sensed “unknowns” from our different life from our frequent travels to then-unusual locations. My parents told us that if asked by anyone “What does your father do?” to answer that “He works for the State Department.” And then change the subject.

My father honored his Official Secrets Act oath taken as an 18-year-old in 1943 all of his life. Eventually his WWII files were declassified during the mid-and late 1990s. His CIA files and some OSS/SOE files remain classified to this day. Dad’s story finally eased out in amazing ways allowing us all access to his full story. The unearthing of specifics is a 20-year culmination of discussions notes interviews and shared experiences as my wife and I returned with Dad for his first time back to France since October 1944. My father’s story is a rare one. The heroic women and men of Special Operation Executive F Section represent the courage of a select few desperately needed to help defeat the Nazis.

Place this excerpt in context. How does it fit into the book as a whole and why did you select it?

I was five years old at the time I first looked at the contents of the tin box where my father kept his secrets. In 1956 we were living in a quonset hut on Saipan. This is one of my earliest moments when I sensed there were “unknowns” about my family.

Tell us about creating this book: any research and travel you might have done any other influences on which you drew?

The National Archives in the U.S. the U.K. and France had some original records. The impressive Imperial War Museum collection was informative and captivating. Musee de la Resistance Limoges a center of resistance and the Salesmen II team history as well as the CIA library and U.S. National Archives each had useful but far-from-extensive files. My father after 1994 was a source of considerable information obtained from formal interviews and casual conversations with him.

His surviving comrade M. Bob Maloubier was a prolific source of personal stories and James Edgar the last surviving SOE agent who operated in occupied France also was a great resource. They contributed mightily with keen memories and details.

My wife father and I attended the grand opening of the Violette Szabo Museum in the U.K. in 2000. We then returned to France where we explored drop zones ambush and demolition sites escape routes wireless huts and more. A return trip in 2001 to locations in the Limousin region where he operated during the summer of 1944 also helped our research. We had a most remarkable discussion with Leo Marks who was a genius deemed too odd to work with famous codebreaker Alan Turning at Benchley Park. Marks was off-loaded to SOE to be their head cryptographer for all codes in the European Theater.

I also benefited from extensive references in historical books original documents (some stored in the tin bread box) and the assistance of historical experts.

What were the biggest challenges you faced or surprises you encountered in completing this book?

OSS and SOE intentionally destroyed an estimated 87% of their files shortly after the war in an effort to protect the few surviving agents from acts of retribution to limit any possibility of war crime charges against surviving agents and to protect political leadership from possible legal or public relations repercussions from these unofficial secret operations.

Walk us through your writing process: Where and when do you write? What time of day? Do you listen to music need quiet?

I prefer writing in quiet. Frequently I begin in the very early mornings. I do my most productive drafting when I’ve completed my research significantly ahead of time allowing ample time for me to place the data into context and overlaying that with other details while referring to personal notes relating to the event at hand.

What’s your next project?

I’m working with a 5-time Emmy Award-winning documentary film producer on a film about “Scholars of Mayhem” to be released on PBS and NPR in late 2021.

I’m also drafting my second book about my father’s secret mission deep in the jungles of China and Burma in 1945.

Beyond that I’ve been pecking away gathering research data of his Cold War era Dad’s 13 years’ service in the CIA overlaying his notes comments and locations where we lived in the late 1950s and 1960s. Yes another complex puzzle!

I wasn't going be a doctor. My father was a mechanical engineer and my brother and sister are engineers. So sciences and entrepreneurship were early influences in my life.

There is some truth to the notion that your hobby can eventually become your career. When I was a child I had a fascination with sneakers. I wanted to be the one to have the “in” shoes but didn’t want to ask my mother for money to purchase Air Jordans. So I became curious about how to use technology to get what I wanted. The more I recognized how accessible sneakers were via technology the more I realized that I was actually chasing a passion and building up my core skill sets that aided me today. The way I think about security and technology in general have been given to me by how I engaged in the sneaker practice.

I first joined Goldman Sachs as a consultant on a security transformation project in Technology Risk where I helped develop one of the firm’s first implementations of continuous control monitoring. Upon completion I was asked to help manage what I built and I took that opportunity to move positions internally. This recruiting process allowed me to meet individuals with diverse expertise and introduced me to areas across the firm that gave me a wealth of knowledge about what a potential career in Engineering would look like.

I am the chief risk officer for the Core Engineering business unit where I head Security Platform Engineering and Core Engineering Risk Management. Our mission is to aid in developing the firm’s security strategy to improve the quality of our platforms and implement corrective actions across the firm. We are currently developing a new initiative with specific cloud services and guardrail controls that expedite development to the cloud. This project has been an excellent opportunity to work with a diverse group of engineers who are passionate about the developer experience while also ensuring that security is a first-principle standard.

I am also co-head of the firm’s Black Engineers (BE) Network. One thing that I am particularly proud of is being able to give back through recruiting efforts. A signature program for us is the Africa Recruiting Initiative (ARI) which has expanded into Ghana and Kenya enabled me to go back to Nigeria to recruit talented engineers to Goldman Sachs. I’m excited about the amazing talent we have recruited from the region over the last four years many of whom are self-taught.

Outside of the office I enjoy working out hanging out with my daughter and I have loved to channel my inner creativity through interior design while renovating my home.

My advice for young engineers: Develop your skillset and put yourself in challenging positions that will allow you to grow as an individual. Surround yourself with friends mentors and sponsors who contribute to your development. Ultimately understand the uniqueness of who you are and run your own race. A large part of your success will be how you can bring your own diversity in thought acumen and personality to influence and drive change.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vdG9wLWZpbmFuY2UtbmV3cy1nYW1lc3RvcC1sZW9uLWJsYWNrLWpvbi1ncmF5LWdvbGRtYW4tYmxhY2tzdG9uZS0yMDIxLTHSAWtodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuY29tL3RvcC1maW5hbmNlLW5ld3MtZ2FtZXN0b3AtbGVvbi1ibGFjay1qb24tZ3JheS1nb2xkbWFuLWJsYWNrc3RvbmUtMjAyMS0xP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Top finance news from week of Jan 25: GameStop Jon Gray Goldman,"Hello readers!

The off-market $21.5 million transaction closed this month and the Moelis family holdings now include two side-by-side homes with 8600 square feet of living space and 8 bedrooms and 10 bathrooms all of them located on one of the seaside city’s most coveted strips of sand.

Tax records say the latest acquisition was built in 1986 and last sold in 2017 to Calabasas-based real estate investor Gary Simons. Since then the house has been occasionally used as a high-priced rental; the MLS shows it was leased out in 2018 at a brain-addling rate of $42000 per month.

The vaguely Mediterranean villa-style house spans sits on a long and narrow beachfront lot. Street-side there’s a two car garage and gated entrance to a courtyard; further back is the main house with its beachside deck and stunning whitewater views. Upstairs there’s a large master with a fireplace and private balcony.

Included with the transfer were renderings for a full-scale contemporary home renovation though it’s not clear if Moelis plans to proceed with the work. The renderings show a newly reimagined getaway with foldaway glass doors blurring the indoor/outdoor barrier a new courtyard swimming pool a European-inspired kitchen and a completely open floorplan with dozens of twinkling recessed LED lights.

Other deep-pocketed homeowners along this same dazzling strip of Malibu sand include brotherly billionaires Alec and Tom Gores former Clippers owner Donald Sterling Sting and his actress wife Trudie Styler Goldman Sachs moneyman Andy Gordon “Dallas” actress Victoria Principal Greek billionaire Alki David and tennis champ John McEntroe with his ’80s rocker wife Patty Smyth.

Moelis 62 has been a player in the high-stakes world of investment banking for 40+ years initially under Michael Milken at the now-defunct Drexel Burnham Lambert bank. In 2007 he founded his own own firm Moelis & Company which now has upwards of 900 employees and 17 offices globally. Some of the Wharton grad’s notable career milestones include handling the record $2 billion sale of the Dodgers in 2012 and advising Saudi Arabia’s state-owned oil company on the biggest IPO debut in history.

Moelis and longtime wife Julie have been part-time Malibu residents since 1996 when the couple tossed out $3.2 million for the house that sits right next door to their new $21.5 million addition. They also maintain a NYC residence — back in 2018 Moelis paid a whopping $62 million for a penthouse at the 520 Park Avenue skyscraper along Manhattan’s so-called “Billionaires’ Row.” But the family’s primary home has long been a particularly lavish estate in Beverly Hills this one with a 15000-square-foot main house more than two acres of park-like grounds a guesthouse and a tennis court.

In May 1912 brother and sister William and Lucy Woodruff sold a portion of the 64 acres of land they had inherited from their father George to a businessman named Fred Arnold.

What was Arnold’s business? He was the owner of Trout Brook Ice & Feed which had been established in 1879 by his father Edwin Arnold. Business was good. The company had an ice pond on Trout Brook in town and one in New Hartford. Arnold purchased the land on what was once the Middle Road to Farmington with the express purpose of building an ice pond.

Learn more about Arnold’s endeavors – including how an accidental flooding of Ignatius Kulakowski’s field created a second body of water – and how a West Hartford resident and developer Wallace B.

By Ronni Newton

Robert “Bob” Elsner recently celebrated his 75th anniversary as a member of American Legion Hayes-Velhage Post 96 and in January members honored the West Hartford resident and World War II veteran for another special milestone – his 100th birthday.

On Jan. 9 members of Post 96 honored their longest-serving member with a drive-by to celebrate his 100th birthday.

Elsner and his three brothers all served in WWII.

When presenting Elsner with a certificate honoring his 75 years last fall Post 96 Commander Patrick Harrell had a chance to look through some of his military memorabilia including a Western Union telegram that his parents sent to their youngest son in 1942 the night before he was leaving for deployment in Europe wishing him a “bright and cheerful future” in the Army and spirit of friendship.

“I was so moved by the positive attitude of this telegram because I can’t imagine what was going through their minds as they were sending their fourth son into that arena” Harrell said at West Hartford’s Veterans Day ceremony on Nov. 11 2020. “All four came home.”

“The telegram moved me” Harrell wrote in a recent Post 96 newsletter. “Its positive message in that crisis time reminded me of the enormous challenges past generations have faced and overcame. It renewed my spirit and faith that we will weather and overcome this current threat to our health and economy.”

Elsner recently shared some stories from his service in a Post 96 newsletter. He said he thought when he got on the troop train from Fort Devens MA where he had been sent after leaving Hartford that he would be heading to Fort Monmouth NJ to serve in the signal corps as a photographer. He said he instead ended up at Camp Carson in Colorado and ended up as part of a medical battalion.

The following was shared in the Post 96 newsletter:

In the discussion of his time in the European theater Bob shared several expereiences. One event was about when towns surrended the people were told to bring any weapons to the town hall to be turned in. On one occasion a officer was inspecting a rifle which had been turned in and was told be be carefull. He failed to inspect the rifle to see if it was loaded and discharged it into the ceiling.

When towns surrendered homes were sometimes used to billet pesonal but just for sleeping. On one occasion a soldier decided to inspect a bedroom closet and in doing so found a large picture of Hilter. He edited the painting with his knife and placed it back into the closet.

When the war ended Company C 314 Medical Battalion was transported back to the United States aboard the USS Enterprise CV-6 arriving back in New York City.

After the war Bob would join his fellow company members of the “Rolling W” for reunions to renew friendship that were created during the war.

Elsner was awarded a Bronze Star in 1988 for “meritorious achievement in ground combat against the armed enemy during World War II in the European African Middle Eastern Theater of Operations.”

Joe Collaboration,"It’s Saturday night and Hasbro just dropped news on a collaboration with Epic Games that brings an iconic ninja commando to Fortnite as the latest Hunter to pass through the Zero Point.

Fortnite x G.I. Joe kicks off with the addition of Snake Eyes to Fortnite‘s battle royale. The Arashikage Clan set is available in the Fortnite Item Shop for a limited time and features all the tools that players will need to drop from the Battle Bus as a member of the ‘Joe crew. The set includes the Snake Eyes Outfit complete with a Katana Pickaxe and Back Bling.

Hasbro Pulse also dropped the curtain on the Fortnite x G.I. Joe Collaborative Snake Eyes: Zero Point Edition action figure.

The 6-inch figure extends the G.I. Joe Classified Series lineup with a game-inspired design that marks the first time ever that a Snake Eyes action figure has been released with the G.I. Joe logo on its shoulders. Snake Eyes features more than 20 points of articulation and comes with Fortnite-inspired weapon accessories including the Harpoon Launcher Boogie Bomb Grenade Clinger Chiller Grenade and the Submachine weapon and Mythic Shockwave Launcher accessories featuring the Weathered Black Wrap deco as seen in the game.

Snake Eyes also includes an additional hand along with traditional accessories including his Morning Light katana and sheath accessories inspired by the G.I. Joe universe. The figure is available for preorder now with expected delivery in Jan. 2022.

The Fortnite collaboration is just the first piece of major G.I. Joe news to arrive this year as Hasbro ramps-up its new toy and partnership reveals in the months leading up to the release of the feature film Snake Eyes: G.I. Joe Origins which is slated for release on Oct. 21.

To paraphrase Elton John Saturday night’s alright for fighting so fire up the Xbox or the Playstation and get a little action in with Snake Eyes on Fortnite!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vYmxlZWRpbmdjb29sLmNvbS9jb2xsZWN0aWJsZXMvc3Rhci13YXJzLWhhc2Jyby1waXBlbGluZS1yZXZlYWxzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hasbro Shows Off Upcoming Star Wars Figures With Pipeline Reveals,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://bleedingcool.com/collectibles/star-wars-hasbro-pipeline-reveals/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vYmxlZWRpbmdjb29sLmNvbS9jb2xsZWN0aWJsZXMvc3Rhci13YXJzLWhhc2Jyby1waXBlbGluZS1yZXZlYWxzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN1cGVyaGVyb2h5cGUuY29tL3ZpZGVvLWdhbWVzLzQ5MjUyMC1nLWktam9lcy1zbmFrZS1leWVzLWpvaW5zLWZvcnRuaXRlLWhhc2Jyby1wbGFucy1hY3Rpb24tZmlndXJlLXRpZS1pbtIBeWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN1cGVyaGVyb2h5cGUuY29tL3ZpZGVvLWdhbWVzLzQ5MjUyMC1nLWktam9lcy1zbmFrZS1leWVzLWpvaW5zLWZvcnRuaXRlLWhhc2Jyby1wbGFucy1hY3Rpb24tZmlndXJlLXRpZS1pbi9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,G.I. Joe’s Snake Eyes Joins Fortnite Hasbro Plans Action Figure Tie-In,"At long last Fortnite players will be able to show off their tactical skills as one of the Joes. The game’s developers have just revealed that Snake Eyes is the latest pop culture staple to join its ranks as a playable character making him the first G.I. Joe hero to do so. You can check out the announcement below.

Name? Classified. Date of birth? Classified. Ninja Master? Verified. Snake Eyes from @GIJoeOfficial is the newest Hunter to come through the Zero Point! Grab his Set in the Shop now. pic.twitter.com/7LwasHpqle — Fortnite (@FortniteGame) January 31 2021

Snake Eyes’ arrival comes as part of The Zero Point an ongoing plot thread in Fortnite’s Chapter 2 Season 5. The title refers to the object of the same name which has popped up on several occasions throughout the game’s history and is assumed to be a bridge to other realities. In this particular storyline Agent Jonesy allies himself with familiar characters from a variety of other dimensions. A few other recent additions include The Terminator and Sarah Connor The Mandalorian and Grogu/Baby Yoda Halo’s Master Chief and God of War’s Kratos.

Technically gamers shouldn’t be surprised to see Snake Eyes showing up in Fortnite. Last week Epic Games CCO Donald Mustard Tweeted a picture of himself reading an old G.I. Joe comic book. Although the art was hard to make out Polygon noted that the issue in question Marvel’s G.I. Joe #21 revolves around Snake Eyes’ attempt to help Scarlett escape from Storm Shadow’s Cobra compound.

If that’s not enough Hasbro is also gearing up to release a new Fortnite-inspired Snake Eyes action figure. According to the description the six-inch figure has over 20 points of articulation and comes with a wide range of weapon accessories including a Harpoon Launcher Boogie Bomb and more. Additionally this marks the first time that a Snake Eyes figure has featured the famous G.I. Joe logo on the character’s shoulders. More info can be found here.

For those of us who are a certain age the 1980s had the best after-school cartoons and comic books. Little did we know it at the time but the toy companies were the masterminds behind some of our favorite '80s action heroes. For instance He-Man and the Masters of The Universe created by Mattel and both The Transformers and G.I. Joe were the work of Hasbro . While G.I. Joe wasn't the absolute favorite in my house (that honor goes to The Transfomers) it was a big hit. It's also a natural fit to cross over into existing video game universes like Fortnite  and that's exactly what's happening right now.Mysterious G.I. Joe team member Snake Eyes was always a dangerous ninja. In the past he had a deep and complex history with Cobra Commander but joined the G.I. Joe team when the Arashikage ninja clan dissolved after bumping into Scarlett during a training exercise. In Fornite he's a badass ninja skin that's part of the Arashikage Clan set in the shop. That set includes the ninja master himself along with a katana pickaxe and some back bling. That'll set you back 1800 V-bucks the value of which varies depending on a few factors including how much real-world cash gamers put up at a time to acquire them.Snake Eyes is also returning to the toy aisles of retailers everywhere as well. Hasbro has announced Snake Eyes: Zero Point Edition which is a six-inch action figure with over 20 points of articulation. Hasbro says that this crossover collectible figure comes with a big pile of accessories including a harpoon launcher model grenades and Snake Eyes signature katana Morning Light. Snake Eyes: Zero Point Edition can be pre-ordered through Hasbro's website for a cool $39.99.The Arashikage Clan set is already available for purchase in the Fortnite store ready to take you back to a simpler time. This crossover ties into the Snake Eyes live-action spin-off movie due to come out later this year. Snake Eyes is a spin-off of the live-action G.I. Joe movie series from Paramount which has hit theaters over the last decade. The upcoming movie may not be something you already knew about but now you do. And as they say knowing is half the battle. Yo Joe!"

Innovating Construction One BLOX at a Time

The BLOX team is doing amazing things. Photo via BLOX

BLOX is a team of architects engineers manufacturers builders logisticians computer programmers and more who work together to bring new ideas to the construction industry. With over 400 people BLOX manufactures complete modules that can then be inserted as one whole piece in the construction of a building. This company is truly proof that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.

Their dedicated team has sacrificed time with their families holidays weekends and health to change a legacy industry. With their efforts they’ve made BLOX look like an overnight success. In reality it’s taken passion and hard work from hundreds of people to get there.

“That team… have made this thing look like it’s successful quickly but it’s a lot of people and a lot of time and a lot of hard work to get there.” Chris Giattina CEO BLOX

Along with their growth they’re innovating solutions in the fight against COVID-19. As we reported in March the designers and builders at BLOX didn’t hesitate to create a prototype for Mobile Isolation Care Units (MICU).

BLOX is based in the old Pullman Standard train car factory in Bessemer so they can bring every aspect of the process of building under one roof. Their Design Manufacture Construct (DMC) method combines manufacturing and technology to make construction simple.

The $40M Investment Will Accelerate BLOX’s Mission

ASH Ventures a strategic investment firm based in Atlanta announced the $40M investment in BLOX to allow them to expand production capacity. Over the last year BLOX has seen an increase of 200%.

With this minority investment they will continue growing to meet the needs of their Fortune 500 clients including Walmart Health HCA Healthcare Universal Health Services and Encompass Health. Due to the nature of the investment the control will remain firmly rooted in Birmingham.

Partnering with ASH accelerates our ability to achieve BLOX’s mission of 2x2x2—delivering buildings at twice the speed twice the quality and with twice the value of traditional approaches. Chris Giattina CEO Blox

Aside from their contributions to the healthcare field BLOX is giving back to their surrounding community. Their team’s work includes rebuilding and replacing run-down housing stock in Bessemer in order to rebuild the community. It’s clear that the dedicated BLOX team is passionate about reinvesting in the community they sit in.

This $40M investment is a great step in their goal of making BLOX—and Birmingham—better.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The new cost-free Early Childhood Education Initiative will bear the name of this visionary educational philanthropist and co-founder of MHS.

Since its founding in 1909 by chocolate pioneer Milton S. Hershey and his wife Catherine MHS has helped young people break the cycle of poverty by providing a holistic and cost-free pre-K through 12th grade education and home to students facing extreme economic hardship. Catherine Hershey Schools for Early Learning will allow MHS to expand the impact of Milton and Catherine Hershey’s vision to serve more children from economically disadvantaged and at-risk backgrounds through education.

“Catherine was a trailblazer. At a time when women had little involvement in business and legal affairs Catherine was an equal partner to her husband in founding and growing MHS” said Peter G. Gurt ’85 Milton Hershey School President and himself an alumnus. “When asked years later why he founded MHS Milton Hershey answered ‘It was Kitty’s idea.’ As we embark on this exciting and unprecedented expansion of our mission to help children from poverty reach their full potential it was an easy decision to name this initiative in Catherine’s honor. Catherine Hershey Schools for Early Learning is her legacy.”

MHS began as a dream and vision shared by the Hersheys. Disappointed that they could not have children of their own the Hersheys decided to use their wealth to support children who needed help the most. On November 19 1909 Milton and Catherine Hershey signed the Deed of Trust establishing the Hershey Industrial School (now Milton Hershey School)—a home and school for orphaned children. With a philosophy ahead of its time the school educated the whole child providing a stable home life rigorous academic learning and agricultural and vocational training.

Milton Hershey School is investing $350 million to fund the development of up to six cost-free Early Childhood Resource Centers (ECRCs) in Pennsylvania for children from birth to age 5 from economically disadvantaged and at-risk backgrounds. While maintaining his leadership role at MHS Gurt will also serve as president of CHS. The Centers will operate through subsidiaries of Milton Hershey School independent of the MHS core model.

Catherine Hershey Schools for Early Learning will provide a core early learning program with a curriculum designed to enhance students’ educational social emotional and cognitive development. The school will also provide students with nutritious meals transportation and other needed supplies and they will offer integrated support services to families of enrolled children.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL25vdmFjYXBzZmFucy5jb20vMjAyMS8wMS8zMC9jYXBpdGFscy1yZS1hc3NpZ24tY29ubm9yLW1jbWljaGFlbC10by1oZXJzaGV5LWJlYXJzLXJlLWFzc2lnbi1waGlsaXBwZS1tYWlsbGV0LXRvLWNhcGl0YWxzLXRheGktc3F1YWQv0gGPAWh0dHBzOi8vbm92YWNhcHNmYW5zLmNvbS8yMDIxLzAxLzMwL2NhcGl0YWxzLXJlLWFzc2lnbi1jb25ub3ItbWNtaWNoYWVsLXRvLWhlcnNoZXktYmVhcnMtcmUtYXNzaWduLXBoaWxpcHBlLW1haWxsZXQtdG8tY2FwaXRhbHMtdGF4aS1zcXVhZC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Capitals Re-assign Connor McMichael To Hershey Bears Re-assign Philippe Maillet To Capitals Taxi Squad,"The Washington Capitals announced Saturday morning that they have re-assigned forward Connor McMichael to Hershey and re-assigned forward Philippe Maillet to the Capitals taxi squad.

The longtime voice of the Capitals will not be calling the next few Capitals games after being exposed to a family member with COVID-19.

Walton writes:

On Friday I was made aware that I have been exposed to a family member that has tested positive for COVID-19. Following health and safety protocols I will be in quarantine for a period of time and will miss the next few games on the broadcast. I will miss you all while I’m away but the safety of our players staff and building personnel always comes first. Hershey’s Zack Fisch will be on the call in my absence. I will return when it is safe to do so. Be safe. Wash your hands. Now and always it’s okay to believe. John

Walton was also contracted to do play-by-play on TV for NBC Sports throughout the season as well.

Meanwhile Walton’s replacement Fisch is essentially getting a major-league call up from the AHL where he leads coverage and public relations of the Bears. Fisch has experience calling games for the Capitals before.

Thanks to Bryan Helmer and the #ALLCAPS for one of the coolest gifts I've ever received! Autographed game sheet and puck from my NHL debut in a shadow box. I can't wait to hang this in my office.

Robertson Hilton Obituary 2021 - Brown-Forward Funeral Service,"R. Robertson Hilton (11/14/50—1/30/21) a former international banker noted Cleveland philanthropist and the retired CEO and President of the A. M. McGregor Foundation passed away unexpectedly in Charlottesville Va. on January 30. He was a man of ideas and ideals who committed himself to furthering causes such as neighborhood nutrition and successful aging.

Rob’s professional career combined his many interests. After obtaining his M.B.A. in International Finance from the University of Chicago in 1974 Rob joined the First National Bank of Chicago. He married his wife Dale Kocen Hilton in 1976. They were transferred by the bank to Tokyo and developed an enduring appreciation of Japanese art and culture. In Tokyo Rob studied the Japanese language intensively became a sumo fan and learned how to wheel throw and hand build pottery.

After returning to the States in 1982 the family settled in Evanston IL and later Cleveland Heights Ohio where Rob continued his career with First Chicago opening a Cleveland office. He served in other corporate financial positions with NACCO Industries Inc and Key Bank. However Rob eventually found his calling in community work arising from years as a board member of the A.M. McGregor Home a not-for-profit direct provider of residential care. He joined the organization in 2001 as CEO and was instrumental in establishing the McGregor Foundation to “support seniors in need and those who serve them.” Over the years Hilton and his colleagues grew the institution into The A.M. McGregor Group comprising The McGregor Foundation The A.M. McGregor Home and McGregor PACE (Program of the All-inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE)).

In 2005 Rob received his Doctor of Management Degree from the Weatherhead School of Management at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland where his research project was titled “Strangers in the Commons: Understanding and Measuring Successful Aging for Low-Income Seniors in Affordable Housing.” After receiving his doctoral degree he continued to be involved at the Weatherhead School in teaching and mentoring roles.

Dr. Hilton served on the Boards of many community-based and nonprofit organizations. He served as Chairman of the Board of Directors of the International Association of Homes and Services for Aging (IAHSA) in 2012-2013. In addition he held Board positions with Green City Growers of Cleveland The Evergreen Cooperative Cleveland Decorative Arts The American Association of Service Coordinators and Grantmakers in Aging which recently named him as an honorary life trustee.

Dr. Hilton enjoyed collecting American and English pottery engaging in architectural and historical preservation projects cooking for friends and reading. He was a member of Cleveland’s bibliographic society: The Rowfant Club. His decades-long involvement in Fairmount Presbyterian Church included roles as Clerk of Session Elder Trustee and Sunday Greeter. Rob had recently begun new preservation projects at a historic cottage in Barboursville VA where he had settled with his wife Dale.

Rob was born in Boston and spent his early years in Cambridge Massachusetts and Pittsburg PA where his father was on the faculty of Carnegie Mellon University. The family relocated to Princeton N.J. in 1962. After graduating from Princeton High School Rob attended Wesleyan University in Middletown CT studying Architecture and American History deep interests he pursued in his many travels over the years.

Rob was preceded in death by his parents. Dr. Thomas L Hilton and Alice Robertson Hilton and his beloved son James Robertson Hilton who died in 2010. Survivors include his adoring wife of 44 years Dale Kocen Hilton and his brothers William Hilton and Thomas L. Hilton Jr. Rob leaves behind scores of loving friends who describe him as a gem a treasured mentor colleague and a man of intelligence humility and deep reflection.

Six McKinsey colleagues were among them: our global managing partner Kevin Sneader senior partner Cornelius Baur North America managing partner Liz Hilton Segel senior partner Dame Vivian Hunt McKinsey Accelerate global leader Daniel Pacthod and Asia offices chairman Oliver Tonby. Against the backdrop of the global pandemic each joined dozens of sessions on urgent matters like climate change diversity and inclusion the future of work and manufacturing and much more.

Throughout the week we also announced new WEF partnerships. We committed to be one of 61 leading organizations that will share metrics focused on “people planet prosperity and governance” as part of the Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics initiative. And McKinsey became a founding member of the forum’s Partnering for Racial Justice in Business initiative a new global coalition dedicated to fighting racism in the workplace.

“McKinsey is proud to be a founding member of this new coalition” Kevin said of the anti-racism initiative “that is working to tackle issues of racial injustice in the workplace and identify solutions that work across the globe.”

To hear more from Kevin and the rest of our delegation on a Davos like no other read on.

Beyond the pandemic itself one topic dominated the agenda this year and it’s the same one that held sway a year ago: climate change and the transition to a net zero economy. Of course January 2020’s momentum around business action to foster a green economy was slowed by the advent of the pandemic. But listening and participating in the many virtual sessions taking place this week leads to a view that there is renewed commitment to ensure a green recovery—even if it may have shades of brown as the resumption of some activity leads to an emissions rise.

This was evident in various sessions. Heads of government lined up to encourage and commit to action. Presidents Macron and Xi along with Chancellor Merkel used their remarks to urge multilateral action. Asset owners such as Larry Fink made sweeping commitments to push for institutions to take action and put their own houses in order. And CEOs responded with much discussion of the paths they would take to ensure they helped achieve the Paris climate accords or better.

Placing gender parity at the heart of the recovery What policies practices and partnerships are needed to shape an equal future of work for women and accelerate progress towards parity? McKinsey’s managing partner Kevin Sneader participates in an impact session on gender parity.

Of course many other topics occupied the minds of those who joined the week’s hundreds of panels. I participated in a conversation around gender parity while sustainable consumption was another topic that seemed to fill many hours of the agenda. It was a very different Davos. The face-to-face time gave way to a highly efficient but somewhat cooler set of online discussions. For me virtual Davos was no substitute for the real thing.

Appropriately the global pandemic figured prominently in several discussions and it became clear that all nations are united in this crisis of a century. There were repeated calls for joint efforts and specifically for multilateralism which emerged as one of the event’s most popular terms this year.

Digital is the essential prerequisite for growth. The South African President spoke about the continent’s hunger for digital and in India more than six million people were trained on digital during the pandemic. Meanwhile accelerating the introduction of industry 4.0 technology raised concerns about a potential uptick in unemployment which could generate massive public frustration in certain markets. This made the importance of reskilling abundantly clear: at-risk workers must be quickly upskilled and given new hope in these situations.

Looking ahead the consensus seemed to be that 2021 will be a year of two very different phases in Europe and the US: the first lasting until about midyear could see slightly negative growth as further public funding and subsidies continue to roll out in an effort to aid recovery efforts. The second phase however should see strong growth leading to small annualized gains in Europe and slightly larger ones in the US.

As global leaders shared their perspectives on rebuilding in 2021 what I heard louder and with more urgency than ever was the case for investing in people. From a workforce perspective this means that supporting the wellbeing of employees and investing in the reskilling of workforces is no longer an advantage but rather a requirement to ensure the long-term resilience and growth of global businesses and economies.

In a CEO discussion convened by Fortune we heard from business leaders on the most important changes they are making to emerge stronger from the challenges of the past year. Responses ranged from reskilling and retraining employees to meeting the shifting needs of consumers to fostering a more flexible empathetic and connected workforce in our hybrid work world. Elsewhere conversations covered the new social contract of business and the importance of collaboration at a local level to make a difference.

I shared more thoughts on the actions businesses can take to support their employees’ wellbeing on the Davos Agenda blog. As these conversations continue people must remain the priority. This is how we invest in the future.

My conversations made clear this week that we are still facing a global crisis on several fronts; we may be over the worst in some cases but we continue to face huge choices with regards to our shared and interconnected recovery. When it comes to the health of people globally the steps we take towards a global and equitable vaccine rollout are critical and will have a huge impact.

Meanwhile on the economic front there has been a huge focus on rebuilding through a stakeholder capitalism lens. The ESG agenda was integrated into all aspects of the Davos Agenda in a way that is unprecedented (at least in my experience). The crisis has created and accelerated inequality in the workplace and beyond and business leaders have a responsibility to make better choices on inclusive growth green growth and strong interconnections globally.

McKinsey and World Economic Forum: The Davos Agenda As a strategic partner McKinsey supports the World Economic Forum’s mission of improving the state of the world.

If real progress is to be made on those fronts metrics will have to matter: And there was a feeling of real responsibility among the delegates this year around the notion of measuring and monitoring our progress. It reminded me of one of my takeaways from last year; when it’s at its best Davos is a ‘do shop’ where people set plans in motion not just a ‘talk shop’.

Daniel Pacthod

There were several themes that cut across the sessions I joined this week. Many delegates talked about the importance of driving responsible industry transformation as business leaders continue to embrace stakeholder capitalism. There was also a clear desire to accelerate the sustainability transition and become better stewards of our planet. This was most evident in everyone’s anticipation of the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow this November.

Leaders also talked about rethinking economic and social systems to help those who need it most especially in the form of job creation and accelerating the tech transformation for the good of society. What happened in the last 12 months in vaccines is remarkable; and while the bio-revolution is the next unlock the focus has to remain on “tech for the good of society.”

Finally there were discussions on the need for a new multi-lateral system that is fair and takes into account the geopolitical economic and human necessities of the 21st century. A key facet of that society would put public trust on the front burner; across all the sessions public- and private-sector leaders realize the need to re-establish trust and engage the younger generations.

The mood this week was realistic—everyone had a clear-eyed view of the challenges ahead—but I also heard reasons for hope and optimism. One thing we have seen is the role technology can and does play not only in combating the pandemic but also in creating further opportunities for growth.

In the COVID-19 era three attributes matter when it comes to business growth. The first is speed. The pace of tech innovation among companies workers consumers and citizens has accelerated. The second is collaboration which we see in the case of organizations working together to solve big problems. And the third is resilience. The pandemic has created a situation where going forward it may now be unthinkable to make a big move without first asking an important question: how pandemic-proof is this?

Finally as many of my fellow Davos Agenda attendees have noted climate change was one of the most talked-about topics over the course of the week. Where government policies around sustainability stall stakeholders may increasingly turn to business—one of the most trusted institutions in society at the moment—and demand action.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIxLTAxLTMxL2hpbHRvbi12YWxlbnRpbmUtZm91bmRpbmctYW5pbWFscy1ndWl0YXJpc3QtZGllcy1hdC03N9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hilton Valentine Founding Animals Guitarist Dies At 77,"London (AP) -- Hilton Valentine the founding guitarist of the English rock and roll band The Animals who is credited with coming up with one of the most famous opening riffs of the 1960s has died.

Malicious Google search ads are nothing new with campaigns for Amazon Prime PayPal and eBay seen in the past. As these ads look like legitimate campaigns for the company including showing their standard URL when you hover over them it is common for people to be tricked into clicking on them.

Yesterday BleepingComputer was notified by someone who fell for a malicious Home Depot advertisement currently displayed in the top spot of a Google search.

As a test BleepingComputer searched for 'home depot' and was shown the malicious advertisement on our first try. Even worse the ad is the top spot in the research result making it more likely to be clicked.

As you can see below the ad clearly states it's for www.homedepot.com and hovering over it shows the site's legitimate destination URL.

Home Depot ad in Google Search

However when visitors click on the ad they will be redirected through various ad services until eventually they are redirected to a tech support scam.

Redirects from Google ad search to tech support scam

Ultimately the visitor will land at a page showing an incredibly annoying ""Windows Defender - Security Warning' tech support scam. This scam will repeatedly open the Print dialog box as shown below which prevents the visitor from easily closing the page.

Tech support scam shown by clicking on the Home Depot ad

To make it more difficult for security professionals to diagnose these ads it appears that they only redirect to the scam once every 24 hours to the same IP address. Once a tech support scam is shown by clicking on the ad subsequent clicks bring visitors to the legitimate site.

Unfortunately many people especially older people who are not comfortable with computers fall for these scams and call the number thinking it is a legitimate alert.

In some cases the caller is tricked into allowing remote access to their computer where the scammers install programs like Lock My PC. The scammers then state that the caller must purchase a support package to unlock Windows.

To avoid these types of ads users are advised to pay more attention to Google search results to not click on ads instead of the legitimate search page result for the company.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzLWpvdXJuYWxvbmxpbmUuY29tL3N0b3J5L2J1c2luZXNzL3JlYWwtZXN0YXRlLzIwMjEvMDEvMzEvaG9wZWZ1bC1zaWducy1kYXl0b25hcy1pc2ItY29ycmlkb3ItYW1pZC1yZXRhaWwtcnVzaC1scGdhLWFyZWEvNDI0MzQ0NjAwMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hopeful signs for Daytona's ISB corridor amid retail rush to LPGA area,"No commitment required.

Neighbors are complaining of the uptick in crime and businesses are trying to move out.

A police officer and neighbors said the homeless broke down a fence and took over the large lot next to the High Street Home Depot about three months ago. Now the privately owned lot is packed with RV's cars and tents.

Oakland Councilman Noel Gallo said a fast food restaurant was supposed to open at the site but had backed up due to the ongoing homeless problem. And the problem is not just taking place within the lot.

The homeless have parked their vehicles on several streets and blocked off sidewalks with trash. Neighbors and business owners said they're fed up and they feel helpless.

""We have wanted to move for a while because we don't feel supported (by the city)"" said Jennifer Engle. ""And we had our opportunity this summer but when COVID stuck that was taken away.""

Jennifer and Matthew Engle own Bay Island Gymnastics on Alameda Ave. across from the large illegal homeless encampment. They said it's become a safety issue with some homeless people harassing staff and students.

""(A homeless woman) threatened to end my mom's life"" said Kaili Engle a gymnast at the facility and daughter of Jennifer. ""It still scares me.""

""(The homeless have) thrown things at my employees. We've had people completely exposed themselves to my employees"" said Jennifer Engle.

A manager at the nearby car wash told KPIX 5 a homeless woman tried to stab him with a knife and attacked other workers. Neighbors also said they're seeing a rise in burglaries as well.

""Home Depot has once again challenged us (saying) if we don't clear this they're leaving Oakland"" said Gallo who represents the area.

The councilman said he too is frustrated with the lack of enforcement of basic parking laws. He said he's repeatedly asked the city administrator to solve the problem yet there had been no action and the problem keeps getting worse.

""There's no excuse. It comes to incompetence"" Gallo said.

Public works cleaned up the site and moved the homeless to a city-run RV lot in December of 2019. But neighbors said the problem is now bigger than before.

""(We're asking) the city to do the right thing and try to help these people. In helping these people in return it'll help the businesses"" said Jennifer Engle.

""We need the city to step up. I mean we know this is a crisis"" said Matthew Engle.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHA6Ly95b25rZXJzdGltZXMuY29tL2VyaWMtZGliYXJ0b2xvcy1hcnJlc3Qtc2hvd3MtdXMtdGhhdC1mb3ItdGhlLWdyZWVkeS1pdHMtbmV2ZXItZW5vdWdoL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Eric DiBartolo’s Arrest Shows us That for the Greedy Its Never Enough,"Eric DiBartolo

The Bible tells us “So are the ways of everyone who is greedy for gain.”

Eric DiBartolo is a longtime resident of Yorktown my hometown. He graduated from Yorktown High School and stayed in town rising to become the Highway Superintendent from (1995-2013) head of the volunteer fire department and frequently seen on News 12 when a snowstorm would be coming.

DiBartolo also served as the President of the Yorktown Chamber of Commerce and was a powerful member of the Yorktown Republican party. To say that DiBartolo was a prominent and respected member of Yorktown would be an understatement… until last week when he was arrested for a petty scheme to steal $15000 worth of building supplies from Home Depot.

DiBartolo who many believe is a millionaire based on his large salary for years as Highway Superintendent his pension and his other business ventures over the years including a local funeral home was arrested on Jan. 6 but the news of this did not come out until late January.

He was arrested by Westchester Police because the crimes occured at the Home Depot in Cortlandt Manor. He faces charges which could put him in jail the most serious of which are four counts of felony grand larceny and 19 misdemeanor counts of petit larceny.

Published reports have police stating that DiBartolo worked with a Home Depot clerk to steal goods from the store by having the clerk NOT scan many items in essence giving them to DiBartolo for free. The clerk involved in the scam was also arrested. Tyrone Bass faces similar charges.

One example from Westchester County police spokesman Kieran O’Leary was when DiBartolo is charged with not paying for $1200 worth of merchandise while being billed $89 for a few items in his cart.

Bass is said to have received a few hundred dollars total for the 23 times that this happened or the 23 times that Home Depot knows it happened. How many times the two worked the scheme before someboody figured it out is unknown. Both will be charged in Cortlandt Town Court this month.

Another interesting twist to DiBartolo’s thefts is that it cost the taxpayers in the Town of Cortlandt and the Lakeland School district more than $1300 in lost sales tax revenues. So all of us in these districts were also taken by DiBartolo making this reporter wonder what other schemes and scandal are in DiBartolo’s long history working for the taxpayers we don’t work for you sir.

Yorktown Supervisor Matt Slater said “It is always disappointing and disturbing when a public official is accused of wrongdoing. It’s now in the hands of the justice system to investigate and determine the outcome.”

One of DiBartolo’s campaigns for Highway Superintendent was against Stephen Gardner in 2008. Gardner who works in the construction industry called it “hard to believe” that DiBartolo would stoop this low and try to steal from Home Depot 23 times. “It sounds so ridiculous for someone like him to get involved in something so petty” said Gardner echoing the sentiment of many in Yorktown who are asking Why Did He do This?

DiBartolo also has a few other “strange occurances” in his history two of which have been reported and rehashed in the local media.

DiBartolo sued former Yorktown Supervisor Susan Siegel in 2010 for defamation based on an off handed comment made to only one other person in the Yorktown School District. DiBartolo alleged in court that Siegels comments (all that she said was that DiBartolo had “a relationship’ with the sister of a school district employee that works in the highway department) were allegations that he was having a “sexual relationship” with the same women. No evidence was found that Supervisor Siegel who was an honorable Town official had alleged a “sexual relationship.”

More legal battles included a laborer in the Highway Department Kyle Gulitz accusing DiBartolo of allowing a continuous barrage of anti-Semitic remarks. That case never made it to trial.

And another involving William LaPierre owner of Clark Funeral Home. DiBartolo worked for Yorktown Funeral Home a new funeral home in town directly competing with the longtime well-known and respected Clark.

LaPierre had filed a taxpayer’s lawsuit against DiBartolo based on a 2011 State Comptroller’s audit which raised concerns about a $100000 contract between the Town and a company where two of DiBartolo’s brothers worked. That case was withdrawn and never addressed in court.

Yorktown Town Board member Vishnu Patel said “I think he’ll (DiBartolo) be gone once and for all”

The other unknown question at this time is how did Home Depot find out about this?

Patch.com printed this headline back in 2011 Critics of Yorktown Highway Superintendent Allege Corruption Criminal Activity to DA’s Office.

It appears that Mr. DiBartolo with his foolish thefts may have opened a larger ‘can of worms’ into his history. More on this story in the weeks to come. Any information can be emailed to dmurphy@risingmediagroup.com ."

The aim of the undertaking is to examine supply chains and logistics for BMW and “to investigate the transformative potential of quantum computing on the automotive industry” according to Julius Marcea head of IT region Asia-Pacific Eastern Europe Middle East and Africa for the BMW Group.

BMW’s goal in embracing quantum computing is to eventually use it to make complex logistical decisions. A rudimentary example would be that one supplier may be able to deliver a given part or component faster than another who is offering it at a lower price. Honeywell’s H1 computer can be used to determine the optimal choice a process that would be incredibly taxing for a traditional or so-called “classical” computer like the kind many of us use on a daily basis.

Entropica Labs used the Recursive Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (R-QAOA) which is described as a “classic combinatorial problem that is an entry point to many logistics and supply chain problems of industrial interest” according to Honeywell. The results were encouraging with R-QAOA running on the H1 quantum computer outperforming simulations and brute force calculations.

Although largely preliminary and investigatory at this stage the next step for BMW and Entropica is to explore more complex algorithms and to see if they can outperform the “classical” approach to logistical problem solving and decision making. Honeywell Quantum Solutions President Tony Uttley added that the project is an important step toward scaling up quantum technologies and that “We are quickly moving from benchmarking and double-checking data generated on quantum systems and algorithms to being able to tackle real-world enterprise-level problems such as global supply chains.”—Alex Tock

The firm claims that forklifts are safety risks and that growing order volumes and accelerated order cycle times have forced firms to use them more often resulting in potentially dangerous accidents. This is where the PalletTransport1500 comes in.

“Even the most well-managed distribution centers are struggling to keep up with the ongoing growth of e-commerce which is putting tremendous stress on facilities and warehouse associates to move goods in and out of facilities at record speed” said in a statement Fetch Chief Product Officer Stefan Nusser.

“By combining Fetch’s new PalletTransport1500 with Honeywell Intelligrated’s Momentum warehouse execution system (WES) distribution and fulfillment centers will now be able to orchestrate every aspect of automated warehouse execution for maximum facility efficiency and safety.”",,,,,,,,,

Bethesda Maryland-based Host Hotels & Resorts ended 2023 with $2.9 billion of available liquidity an amount that President and CEO Jim Risoleo said gives the REIT an advantage in negotiating acquisitions once attractive hotels and resorts hit the market.

""Frankly there just aren't a lot of properties that are currently listed for sale certainly not assets that would interest Host but that's really not slowing us down at all"" Risoleo said. ""We are talking to our competitors in the industry our friends in the industry and others to try to kick deals loose that are Host-type assets.

""We are leaning on our relationships. We're leaning on our reputation on our ability to close deals all-cash and that really gives us a very meaningful competitive advantage. And we believe this is the year to to get the balance sheet to work.""

Ideally the U.S. Federal Reserve will soon announce the first of several interest rate cuts Risoleo said and that will bring sellers out of hibernation.

""It's going to also spark competition for those assets"" that will come to market he said. ""Our point of view is we have the balance sheet; we can do it all. We want to get out there and we want to get ahead of the pack. And I hope over the course of the next several months that we're going to be able to tell you that we've been a net acquirer early in 2024.""

Asked about the wave of commercial mortgage-backed securities maturing this year and next and whether that will drive hotel sales Risoleo said the wall of distress hasn't materialized.

""This year there's about $26 billion of full-service loans that will be maturing and I know that earlier in the pandemic there was a lot of talk of distress"" Risoleo said. ""Frankly we haven't seen it materialize certainly not on assets or markets that would interest us. But we'll continue to track it.

""There may be pressure as we get later into the year because one of the things that other hotel owners are going to have to deal with sooner or later is reinvesting in their portfolio.""

Host is interested in acquiring large hotels and resorts with diverse demand drivers in the group business transient and leisure segments. Risoleo added ""bigger is better for us"" and that acquiring hotels in urban markets might be on the table again.

What's Next for Maui

Host's resorts on Maui — the Hyatt Regency Maui Resort and Spa the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani — continue to skew the performance of the REIT's portfolio as leisure demand decreased following the wildfires in August. Yet Host's Maui properties have benefited from a steady source of group demand.

Sourav Ghosh Host's executive vice president and chief financial officer said 2023 was ""the year of group and convention hotel recovery"" adding that group room revenue increased 21% year over year and the volume of group room nights sold recovered to 95% of 2019 levels.

""It is worth noting that our group results were positively skewed by disaster and recovery bookings in Maui"" he said. ""Group room revenue exceeded 2022 by 13% in the fourth quarter driven by an increase in both rate and room nights and we estimate roughly half of that growth can be attributed to recovery and relief groups on Maui.""

article 5 Min Read Host Awaits Return of Consistent Hotel Demand in Maui None of Host Hotels & Resorts' three Maui resorts were damaged by the August wildfires but a significant number of bookings were canceled for the fourth quarter. Dan Kubacki Social

Efforts to rebuild Lahaina are ongoing and Risoleo said the west side of Maui will take more time to recover.

""In the interim we have been working with relief agencies in particular the Red Cross. We have contracted with the Red Cross for 350 rooms at the Hyatt Regency Maui through the end of May and we're hopeful that that will be extended while the recovery moves forward"" Risoleo said.

Host is also awaiting a resolution to Hawaii Gov. Josh Green's threat to ban short-term rentals if they aren't opened up as housing for displaced residents. In December Green said the state needed approximately 3000 short-term rental units set aside for Maui residents.

""March 1 is a pivotal date in our mind"" Risoleo said. ""The governor of the state of Hawaii has stated that if the owners of short-term rentals on Maui don't come to terms with allowing their units to be utilized by the displaced residents then he is considering a ban on short-term rentals. ... On the island of Maui in total there's about 30000 short-term rentals. It's quite significant and we're tracking it very closely.""

Risoleo added he hopes leisure travelers will return sooner to Host's two resorts in the Wailea area: the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani. Host concluded 2023 by wrapping up a renovation of the Fairmont Kea Lani's lobby and guestrooms in December.

""We're confident that over time as the consumer begins to understand the differentiation between Wailea which is a completely different submarket than the west side and Ka'anapali that will lead the cadence of business pickup"" he said.

Full-Year Outlook and Earnings Highlights

In its 2024 outlook Host Hotels & Resorts forecasts hotel revenue per available room to grow between 2.5% and 5.5% over 2023. The REIT anticipates net income between $708 million and $794 million and adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization for real estate between $1.59 billion and $1.68 billion.

For full-year 2023 Host's revenue was $5.3 billion up 8.2% over 2022 according to the REIT's earnings release.

Host's full-year net income was $752 million — which was up 17% year over year — and adjusted EBITDAre was $1.6 billion up 8.7% from 2022.

The company's portfolio achieved full-year revenue per available room of $211.71 which was up 8.1% year over year. Average daily rate was $300.66 which was 1.8% above full-year 2022. Hotel occupancy was 70.4% up 6.2% from 2022.

As of publication time Host's stock was trading at $20.48 per share up 5.2% year to date. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 7% for the same period.

Volcon Grunt electric motorcycle video

The Grunt is Volcon’s first planned electric powersports vehicle headed for production at the company’s new factory.

The Texas factory is currently under construction ahead of Grunt production planned to begin later this spring.

Until then Volcon is showing off the Grunt in a new promotional video that shows it climbing berms jumping through the air and generally engaging in exactly the kind of shenanigans you’d expect of an off-road electric motorcycle.

You can see the interesting new electric motorcycle below in all its glory.

https://youtu.be/asYrUJayVes

Powered by a 50 hp (37 kW) electric motor the Grunt is reportedly capable of putting down 75 lb-ft (100 Nm) of torque to its comically wide yet awesome-looking fat wheels.

The bike features a top speed of 60 mph (97 km) and gets up to that speed quickly in just 6 seconds.

With a maximum rated range of 100 miles (160 km) the Grunt is likely to be able to play (or work!) for hours depending on the type of riding you’ll ask from it.

The Grunt will feature multiple power settings and adjustable throttle response so that experienced and new riders alike can enjoy the off-road electric motorcycle safely. And with the low-maintenance associated with electric motorcycles compared with gas motorcycles riders will likely be able to spend a lot more time on the bike and less time kneeling down next to it.

Another advantage of the electric design is that the bike is actually waterproof. As the company explains:

“Like all Volcon vehicles the Grunt’s all-electric powertrain is IP67 rated and fully waterproof. Don’t worry about pressure washing or stalling out crossing deep rivers or streams. The Grunt can actually be ridden underwater.”

No more pulling out spark plugs to drain cylinders! Simply ride through under or over just about any obstacle wet or dry!

The Volcon Grunt is currently takings reservations towards the $5995 purchase price.

Volcon ran a crowd-investing round last year (and full disclosure: I gambled a bit on the company myself) as it prepares to enter production of the Grunt later this year in Texas.

The company also has two other electric vehicles planned for production the two-seater Stag and four-seater Beast UTVs.

Volcon expects the Stag to become available as soon as this summer but the larger Beast won’t be ready until spring of 2022.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMisQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ub3RlYm9va2NoZWNrLm5ldC9BTUQtUnl6ZW4tNy1QUk8tNTg1MFUtaW4tSFAtRWxpdGVCb29rLTg0NS1HOC1sYXB0b3AtdHVybnMtdXAtb24tVXNlckJlbmNobWFyay1hcy1IUC1hbHNvLWFjY2lkZW50YWxseS1yZXZlYWxzLVJ5emVuLTUtUFJPLTU2NTBVLW1vZGVsLjUxNzUwNi4wLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AMD Ryzen 7 PRO 5850U in HP EliteBook 845 G8 laptop turns up on UserBenchmark as HP also accidentally reveals ...,"An AMD Ryzen 7 PRO 5850U and Ryzen 5 PRO 5650U have made their first appearances thanks to a benchmark and a manufacturer. The Ryzen 7 PRO 5850U was spotted in an EliteBook 845 G8 laptop on UserBenchmark while it seems HP managed to unveil the AMD Ryzen 5 PRO 5650U via a prematurely published support page.

Two more Ryzen 5000 mobile processors are apparently incoming in the form of the Ryzen 7 PRO 5850U and Ryzen 5 PRO 5650U. The former was discovered by Tum Apisak being taken for a test run on UserBenchmark while the latter turned up on an HP support page which has now been taken down. AMD released three SKUs in the Ryzen PRO 4000 series so there might be another model for the Ryzen PRO 5000 series to be uncovered yet which would likely be a Ryzen 3 PRO 5X50U chip (possibly 5450).

Starting with the AMD Ryzen 7 PRO 5850U this appeared as part of an HP EliteBook 845 G8 laptop on the much-maligned UserBenchmark website. A base clock of 1.90 GHz is mentioned and thanks to some digging from VideoCardz it appears the boost clock for this chip is 4.40 GHz. The 8-core 16-thread Zen 3 part from the Cezanne series performed well on the benchmark throwing up strong 1-core and 2-core scores of 151 points and 298 points respectively. Additionally the Ryzen 7 PRO 5850U has 20 MB L3 cache and its iGPU clock is 2.0 GHz (8-core graphics processor).

The less powerful AMD Ryzen 5 PRO 5650U is a 6-core 12-thread processor that is probably very similar to its non-PRO consumer counterpart the Ryzen 5 5600U. The boost clock rate is reported at 4.2 GHz with the base clock most likely being 2.3 GHz or thereabouts. This Zen 3 chip has 19 MB L3 cache and seems set to appear in HP’s upcoming EliteBook 845 G8 lineup. AMD’s PRO technologies deliver enhanced security to enterprise setups and Ryzen PRO chips have featured in well-known business names such as HP’s EliteBooks and Lenovo’s ThinkPads.

According to Popular Mechanics the Marine Corps is taking a completely new tack to providing fire support during amphibious landings: unmanned boats stocked full of suicide drones.

The shipbuilder Metal Shark has announced it’s building a new type of unmanned surface vessel which the Marines plan to equip with loitering munitions.

Such a boat would act as a mobile fire support platform servicing calls for fire with salvos of drones equipped with explosive charges.

The Marines are reconfiguring for war with China and they’ve already determined the future battlefield: the South China Sea.

According to a press release posted on Naval News online Louisiana-based ship builder Metal Shark has enlisted autonomous technology developer Spatial Integrated Systems (SIS) recently acquired by Huntington Ingalls Industries to provide the autonomy solution for the Long Range Unmanned Surface Vessel (LRUSV) system.

The latter will usher in a new era of naval technology while increasing the lethality of US forces the press release said pointing to a network of unmanned vessels traveling autonomously and transporting loitering munitions to address targets at sea and on land.

Under an “Other Transaction Authority” agreement with Marine Corps Systems Command Metal Shark will design build test and implement the vessels and will handle the integration of the autonomy system and an advanced Command and Control software suite.

In addition to the autonomous LRUSV Metal Shark will also produce manned support vessels for the LRUSV system utilizing its 40 Defiant military patrol craft platform which the builder is currently producing to create the US Navy’s new “40 PB” patrol boat fleet.

“The LRUSV program represents a significant milestone for autonomous technology for the defense world and for the entire shipbuilding industry” said Metal Shark CEO Chris Allard.

“We are thrilled to be integrating advanced autonomy and Command and Control capability into these highly specialized surface vessels to provide the Marine Corps with a next-generation system.”

The LRUSV program is the latest success for Metal Shark’s Sharktech Autonomous Vessels division a wholly-owned subsidiary launched in 2018 and specifically focused on the advancement of unmanned vessel technology.

In September it was announced that the US Coast Guard had selected a 29-foot Sharktech autonomous test vessel equipped with autonomy.

Metal Shark has designed built and delivered over 400 autonomous and remotely operated vessels to date the release said.

With military spending cuts looming large senior Marine leaders have been called upon to help redefine the service’s central purpose.

The new Marine Corps Commandant’s Planning Guidance crafted by newly appointed Gen. David Berger lays out a striking new vision for the Corps — and jettisons a sizable number of long-held Marine articles of faith along the way War on the Rocks online reported.

Berger’s guidance is both hard-hitting and remarkably well-written and in many ways the planning guidance responds to growing turbulence inside the Marines.

Since 2001 the Marines have served as the nation’s second land army in Afghanistan and then Iraq organized crisis response task forces and forged a special operations component while still clinging tightly to their historic mission of large-scale amphibious landings.

These widely divergent directions have led some Marines to question their identity with one even arguing that the service suffers from a multiple personality disorder.

Berger argues that future adversaries will be increasingly able to contest and even deny access to the maritime domain where the US has long held unchallenged superiority.

He therefore intends to overhaul the Marine Corps so that it can operate inside this contested space during a major maritime fight.

The planning guidance specifically rejects the notion that the Marine Corps is a standalone fighting force that the Navy simply supports with sea transport airpower and logistics.

When the Marines hit the beach during an amphibious assault they will have air cover from the unmanned Metal Shark which will launch loitering suicide drones. Credit: Marine Corps Cpl. Matthew Kirk.

Berger also highlights the growing military threat posed by China especially its sea denial capabilities. In response he explicitly reallocates Marine forces away from the Middle East and other combatant commands to double down in the Pacific.

The III Marine Expeditionary Force “will become our main focus-of-effort” he writes and will solely support the commanders of US Indo-Pacific Command and the Navy’s 7th Fleet.

Furthermore the Marines will eliminate all of their tank units (a capability the service has had for nearly a century) most of its tube artillery and a substantial amount of aviation units.

If the US and China ever come to blows the LRUSV fleet will also play an important part in that battle Popular Mechanics reported.

The Marines plan to roll up Beijing’s fortified islands in the South China Sea hopping from one island to the next using one seized island to help seize another — all while keeping Chinese air and naval forces at bay.

Originally built under the guise of being scientific research stations many of these bases feature ground-based radars anti-ship missiles artillery and military-grade airfields capable of supporting fighter jets.

As for artillery most of these islands are so small that howitzers can’t be employed at a safe distance from enemy fire or might not be able to provide indirect fire at such close ranges.

Amphibious forces hitting the beach will still need some form of fire support to blast apart bunkers strongpoints and other stubborn defenses.

While the Marines will have their own AH-1Z attack helicopters and F-35 fighters enemy air defenses could keep them from performing the close air support mission.

The Marines have apparently hit upon a novel way of providing that fire support: putting it on boats that can circle these small islands using loitering munitions as a form of artillery.

Enter the new lethal Metal Shark — the bringer of death.

In the old days it was usually a US Navy Iowa-class battleship pounding the shore with its 16-inch guns. Now it’s all about drones.

As the Marines hit the beach LRUSVs will launch loitering munitions that take up station above the island. Advancing infantries will then report enemy positions requesting drone attacks as needed.

The drones drop down from their roost above the battlefield smashing into enemy targets and detonating an onboard explosive charge. As one enemy position after another is destroyed the Marines advance until the entire island is overrun.

The drones will also be equipped with “friend or foe” technology to avoid friendly fire casualties.

At least that’s the plan.

The environment your business operates in is changing - and the need for IT and B2B agility is rising. What capabilities does your B2B network need to meet the challenge?

“Gone are the days when enterprises could maintain competitive positioning and meet customer expectations with a ‘good enough’ approach to B2B integration.”

— Saurabh Sharma Principal Analyst Ovum

AI technology's ability to understand correlate and collate the digital transactional data that you exchange with third-party partners provides new levels of visibility and insight into transactional intelligence. You can search and view the entire lifecycle of a transaction in real-time and in context - and drill down to see the details of a speciﬁc transaction.

Correlate data across dozens of data points for each transaction to enable deep visibility into business transactions. You can gain insights across the entire order-to-cash or procure-to-pay cycle down to the underlying order shipment and receipt details.

Access to this level of data and transactional visibility enables users to monitor transactions and performance against KPls and other internal benchmarks. Critical information can also be mined and used to improve customer service and partner engagement.

AI monitors day-to-day document trends between you and your trading partners. When it discovers an anomaly it provides an early warning signal so you can investigate and proactively address the problem before it impacts your business. It works behind the scenes tracking the contents of EDI-based supply chain documents and learning what is typical activity across document volume velocity and value patterns so it can identify anomalies.

The value of AI-enabled transactional intelligence Improve productivity with AI Enable business users to self-serve the information they need using natural language search Deepen visibility in real-time and in context across your B2B transaction lifecycles Quickly react to B2B transaction anomalies Leverage AI machine learning pattern detection and data science expertise Detect and flag anomalies in volume velocity and value patterns

Empower supply chain and other LOB users

How much time does your IT staff spend responding to questions from line-of-business (LOB) users about the status of a transaction or order and related customer service issues? How many hundreds of IT hours are spent annually answering the question ""where is my order?"" How satisﬁed are LOB users with the level of service you are able to provide?

A Vanson Bourne survey of more than 600 IT and business professionals across the globe reported that participants spent on average 80 minutes to find the status of a B2B document.3

B2B and EDI networks are essential but companies struggle to maximize value from the data they contain. AI-enabled networks allow IT to transform the wealth of data and information in these systems into analytics and intelligence that LOB and supply chain users and executives can use to improve performance.

The transactional intelligence and correlation of data and documents makes accessing information signiﬁcantly easier and faster. When combined with AI’s natural language search and expert guidance accessing information from a complex set of systems and partners is user-friendly.

LOB executives and users can search and answer their own B2B transactional questions. This searchability allows IT to spend less time responding to queries from users and more time on higher-level tasks.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlY2NhbmhlcmFsZC5jb20vb3Bpbmlvbi90aGUtZGF3bi1vZi1jb21wdXRlci1hZ2UtaW4tYWRtaW5pc3RyYXRpb24taW4ta2FybmF0YWthLTk0NTgwOC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The dawn of computer age in administration in Karnataka,In short computers have become ubiquitous in the work of the government.

(IDEX Online) - A million rough diamonds seized in raids by the Indian tax authorities on the scanning firm Diyora & Bhanderi are to be returned to their owners.







The company is being investigated over claims of tax evasion and the illegal sale of diamond scanning machines. Its premises in Surat were raided 10 days ago.





Gems belonging to over 800 diamond firms which had been sent to Diyora & Bhanderi Corporation (DBC) for rough scanning were seized along with large quantities of cash.





The Surat income tax authorities responded on Friday to representations by the Southern Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry that diamantaires should have their gems returned as long as they can provide the proper paperwork.





Meanwhile Sarine the Israel-based diamond tech firm accuses DBC of copying the industry-standard Galaxy inclusion mapping software used by its rough diamond scanning machines and is taking action through the High Court of Gujarat in Ahmedabad.

Intel Thermal Velocity Boost is a feature available in certain mobile and desktop CPUs from Intel. The typical CPU has a standard clock speed and turbo boost speed. However CPUs with Intel’s Thermal Velocity Boost have two additional boost speeds. Also known as Intel TVB the feature’s available on Intel’s 10th Generation Core i9 desktop chips 10th Gen i9 i7 and i5 mobile CPUs and the Intel Xeon W-1200 lineup.

Intel Thermal Velocity Boost allows these CPUs to hit even higher boost speeds than its typical all-core turbo boost. CPUs with Thermal Velocity Boost add a Single-Core Thermal Velocity Boost and an All-Core Thermal Velocity Boost.

Intel Thermal Velocity Boost vs Turbo Boost

In addition to its two Thermal Velocity Boost speed and its all-core boost an Intel CPU can use Intel Turbo Boost Max Technology . CPUs with Turbo Boost Max have 1 or 2 favored CPU cores  which are identified as being the fastest of the bunch via binning . Workloads from lightly or single-threaded applications are pushed to these favored core(s) for better performance. These additional frequencies are called Turbo Boost 2.0 (a single-core boost) and Turbo Boost 3.0 (a dual-core boost).

This means that besides its stock clock speed and all-core boost an Intel CPU can have four additional speeds. Let’s break them down.

Turbo Boost 2.0 is a single-core boost available if the CPU’s running under its power current and temperature specifications.

Turbo Boost Max 3.0 speed applies to two favored cores. It’s only achievable if the CPU is running below its power current and temperature specifications.

Single-Core Thermal Velocity Boost takes the faster of the two favored CPU cores to a speed higher than what’s achieved with Turbo Boost Max 3.0.

For 10th Gen desktop CPUs this is only doable if the CPU is running under 70 degrees Celsius (158 degrees Fahrenheit) and if the CPU is working beneath its power current and temperature specifications. For 10th Gen mobile CPUs the temperature threshold is 65 degrees Celsius (149 degrees Fahrenheit).

All-Core Thermal Velocity Boost refers to the speed achievable if every core is active and the CPU is operating under its respective temperature threshold (70 degrees Celsius for desktop chips 65 degrees Celsius for mobile ones).

Production of Intel’s Core i3 chips will begin later this year on its 5nm process followed by the production of mid-range and high-end CPUs being produced for Intel by TSMC on a 3nm process in the second half of 2022.

While we’ve previously discussed Intel’s ongoing problems with its latest process technologies this is the first that we’ve heard of Intel having specific plans for upcoming processors with detailed timeframes. It's worth noting however that Intel has yet to confirm this information.

An Inevitable Move?

This news is the latest in a long-observed saga of Intel’s woes when it comes to the latest process technologies. Despite the likes of Samsung and TSMC having achieved working 7nm and 5nm process technologies Intel is still struggling with 10nm.

In short this is because Intel poured a huge amount of effort into getting to 10nm early before any of its competitors but was still unsuccessful. Even at this point Intel has yet to release its 10nm CPUs; they’re set to hit the market later this year.

Meanwhile TSMC has been awarded for its leadership in 7nm has brought a complete design infrastructure to market for 5nm and is steaming ahead to 3nm and 2nm. The company has also recently reported a year-over-year revenue increase of 14.0% driven largely by strong demand for its “industry-leading” 5nm technology.

Exactly Which Chips Could Move to TSMC 5nm?

If (and at this stage it is a big if) TrendForce’s analysis turns out to be true there’s the obvious question of what chips exactly Intel will move to TSMC’s 5nm process.

Intel has been vocal about keeping the production of certain chips in-house. We know for example that the company’s new Alder Lake CPUs will stay on Intel’s 10nm process as this was recently confirmed with a demonstration at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) where Alder Lake was said to be running on an enhanced SuperFin 10nm process.

Timeline of the evolution of TSMC's 5nm process technology. Image used courtesy of TSMC

At present it’s unclear which architectures the new i3 CPUs will use. By the second half of the year however TrendForce reckons that Intel will have at least three competitive microarchitectures in its portfolio including Willow Cove Golden Cove and Cypress Cove.

And while Intel hasn’t confirmed anything yet it’s not an unthinkable move for the world’s largest supplier of microprocessors to send some of its production to TSMC.

Intel's History of Outsourcing to TSMC

In July 2020 Intel confirmed its plans to outsource the production of some of its GPUs to TSMC and then later doubled down by confirming plans to produce some of its Atom and Xenon system-on-chips at TSMC too.

From an operations point of view it would make sense for Intel to outsource some of its entry- and mid-level processors to a third party like TSMC to free up manufacturing capacity for its higher-end CPUs such as the Xenon Ice Lake Tiger Lake-H and the upcoming Alder Lake processors using its 10nm process technologies at its in-house fabs.

Most recently Reuters reported that Intel plans to outsource its second-gen of GPUs for personal computers dubbed DG2 on TSMC's 7nm process. Meanwhile production of entry-level chips could be sent by Intel to TSMC which is set to begin production at its Arizona-based fab by 2024.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ub3RlYm9va2NoZWNrLm5ldC9JbnRlbC1Db3JlLWk5LTExOTAwSy1hbmQtaTctMTE3MDBLLWtlZXAtUnl6ZW4tNTAwMC1hdC1iYXktYXMtUGFzc01hcmstcG9zdHMtbGF0ZXN0LXNpbmdsZS10aHJlYWQtcGVyZm9ybWFuY2UtY2hhcnQtdXBkYXRlLjUxNzY4OS4wLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel Core i9-11900K and i7-11700K keep Ryzen 5000 at bay as PassMark posts latest single-thread performance ...,"PassMark has recently updated its CPU Mark single-thread performance chart and two Rocket Lake chips in the forms of the Intel Core i9-11900K and i7-11700K occupy the top two positions. There was some resistance from Vermeer especially from the AMD Ryzen 7 5800X but the i9-11900K looks to be immovable for the time being.

4 Reviews

Not long ago we reported about the Intel Core i9-11900K making its initial appearance on the PassMark synthetic benchmark where it recorded a single-thread performance CPU Mark score of 3764 points. At the time the fellow Rocket Lake-S part the i7-11700K was at the top of the site’s leaderboard but now the chart has been officially updated and the i9-11900K has taken its seemingly rightful place as the single-thread performance champion. It has been oft-mentioned that PassMark favors Intel chips in this particular discipline and the current chart certainly still gives that impression for the most part.

However there seems to have been some challenge from AMD’s Zen 3 Vermeer chips with particularly the Ryzen 7 5800X mounting an assault against the Intel interlopers. The 8-core 16-thread Ryzen 5000 part with clocks of 3.8 GHz to 4.7 GHz and a TDP of 105 W managed to push its rating up a few points from 3511 to 3514 points. This brings it to just -0.96% off the Intel Core i7-11700K which is also an 8-core 16-thread processor that can operate from 3.6 GHz to 5.0 GHz while utilizing a 125 TDP.

Although it appears there might be some future scraps brewing between the second and third-placed chips the Intel Core i9-11900K looks pretty secure in first place. But PassMark has issued a warning notice for these new Intel processors stating that the margin for error is high for both SKUs as only a single sample of each has thus far been tested compared to 923 units for the Ryzen 7 5800X at the time of writing. As things stand though it’s another sterling single-thread/core benchmark result for the top-end Rocket Lake-S processors.

Intel Core i9-11900K Rocket Lake Flagship Desktop CPU Scores The Fastest Single-Threaded Performance in Passmark Up To 7% Faster Than The AMD Ryzen 5000 'Zen 3' Chips

The Intel Core i9-11900K with its multiple Cypress Cove core will bring the biggest CPU architectural upgrade in over 5 years. This is because ever since the 6th Generation Skylake CPUs all Intel CPUs up till the 10th Generation Comet Lake CPUs have used the same identical chip architecture based on the 14nm process node. There have been small refinements to the process node over the years but nothing as significant as what Intel is going to offer with Rocket Lake CPUs. The Rocket Lake line is still going to rely on a 14nm process node but the architecture marks a brand new beginning for Intel to try to catch up with AMD's rapid progress achieved with their Zen core architecture.

Intel Core i9-11900K 8 Core & 16 Thread Rocket Lake Desktop CPU Specifications

The Intel Core i9-11900K will be the flagship 11th Gen Rocket Lake Desktop CPU. The chip is going to feature 8 cores and 16 threads. This will result in 16 MB of L3 cache (2 MB per core) and 4 MB of L2 cache (512 KB per core). In terms of clocks the CPU runs at base frequencies of 3.5 GHz but as for boost the CPU will feature a maximum boost clock of 5.2 GHz (1-core) while the all-core boost frequency will be maintained at 4.8 GHz.

The chip will also feature Thermal Velocity Boost which should deliver a 100 MHz jump in the max clock frequency. This should lead to a single-core boost clock of 5.3 GHz making it the first CPU to ever hit such a high frequency out of the box. However do remember that regardless of using the Cypress Cove cores the Core i9-11900K will feature lower cores and threads than the Intel Core i9-10900K. This is partially due to the backporting of Cypress Cove on the refined 14nm process node. The CPU is said to feature a 1st stage power limit of 125W which is standard for a flagship Intel SKU and the 2nd stage power limit or PL2 is rated at 250W.

The listing at Passmark reveals that the Intel Core i9-11900K scores 3764 points in the single-thread and 28082 points in the multi-core tests. Compared to AMD's flagship Ryzen 9 5950X CPU the Core i9-11900K offers 7% faster multi-threaded performance and compared to its predecessor the Intel Core i9-10900K the CPU offers a 19% performance uplift. This result makes the Core i9-11900K top out the Passmark single-core performance chart. But at the same time the Ryzen 9 5950X is much faster in multi-threaded performance while the Core i9-11900K scores a better result versus the i9-10900K despite offering lower cores and threads.

While this is a nice showcase for Intel do note that the Rocket Lake CPUs won't be hitting retail till late March 2021. This puts them close to AMD's next answer which should be either in the form of an enhanced Zen 3+ 'Warhol' or a Zen 4 based next-generation Ryzen lineup. Intel also plans to get its 12th Gen 'Alder Lake' Desktop CPU lineup out by 2H 2021 or Q3 2021 which means that Rocket Lake CPUs will be replaced within 1 or 2 quarters giving them an even shorter lifespan than Kaby Lake which was also replaced by Coffee Lake CPUs a few quarters later.

To spite “hedge fund bros” retail investors led a surge in GameStop’s stock price largely through the trading app Robinhood. While progressives relished watching Wall Street’s old guard scramble amid the chaos fintech firms like Robinhood — apps for lending investing and so on — certainly aren’t seeking an end to financial capitalism. Indeed once Wall Street began shrieking about amateurs beating them at their own absurd game Robinhood warned against the very market volatility it was facilitating then shut down trading of GameStop and other memed stocks leading to at least one class-action lawsuit and Senate and House progressives calling for investigation.

Ultimately it looks like the hedge fund Robinhood users targeted Melvin Capital Management will just be partly bought by a different larger hedge fund Citadel Capital Management. A separate company called Citadel Securities — which has the same owner as Citadel Capital Management Ken Griffin the richest man in Illinois — facilitates some of Robinhood’s transactions.

Robinhood itself makes money by selling data on users’ trades to giant Wall Street firms who then stake their own positions based off what the little guy is up to. The Securities and Exchange Commission also charged Robinhood last month for offering bad trading prices to unsuspecting users since those trades were routed through firms paying Robinhood. If true Robinhood’s users were effectively paying a premium on their trades despite the app marketing itself as “commission free.” This took place between 2015 and late 2018 when Robinhood was growing rapidly according to the SEC.

You wouldn’t know any of this from Robinhood’s faux-populist marketing about “democratizing finance.” But much like traditional Wall Street and Big Tech firms before it fintech is building an echo chamber of industry voices and former regulators to ease oversight and permit its predatory practices. These range from as The Intercept and Type Investigations have previously reported high-interest lending like Best Egg to legitimately novel efforts (at least in our lifetimes) to privatize and surveil the basic operations of the monetary system.

Fintech is neither inherently good nor bad; rather like any technology its potential impact on society is closely tied to the policy decisions guiding its use — and the next four years could define how much the fintech industry is able to shape the financial system. Left to their own devices fintech firms could swindle average people through ill-advised day-trading or high-interest loans usher new systemic risks into the financial system and develop traceable privately owned currencies with the potential to replace cash.

Responding to fintech will be a key regulatory challenge for the Biden administration. But it enters this fight with one hand already tied behind their backs. American financial law vastly predates the digital era and is often ill-suited to describing online financial activity. And plenty of fintech firms design themselves to deliberately evade falling under any legal classifications and the regulations that follow them.

At least three potential Biden nominees have connections to the financial technology industry. Early reporting in January named Michael Barr as Biden’s favorite to be the next comptroller of the currency a crucial regulator of national banks. Progressive legislators and organizations (including the Revolving Door Project at the Center for Economic and Policy Research where the authors of this article work) pushed back citing Barr’s previous bank-friendly record in government and his close ties to fintech. He currently runs a fintech project at the University of Michigan works separately with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation on fintech and advises a fintech-focused venture capital fund. Barr did not respond to a request for comment.

Barr is also an adviser at the Alliance for Innovative Regulation a fintech-funded think tank alongside Georgetown professor Chris Brummer who has been floated as a potential Commodity Futures Trading Commission chair. AIR’s “manifesto” for digital-age regulation argues that we need to overhaul the system — in the opposite direction with a digital alternative that leaves as little oversight as possible. AIR’s regulatory manifesto calls for using biometric data in lieu of traditional know your customer requirements which are the parts of our anti-money laundering regime that require companies to verify that customers are who they say they are when making financial transactions. Brummer did not respond to a request for comment.

Elsewhere AIR calls to throw out or overhaul practically everything that keeps the regulatory system accountable to the public such as Freedom of Information Act processes or public comment periods in favor of surveillance technology.

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency or OCC which is technically part of the Treasury Department but operates with a great deal of independence would be positioned to grant this major invasion of individual privacy. The industry claims that biometric data will be far more secure (and cheaper to administer) than traditional anti-money laundering tactics. Lost in the glowing industry press releases is public input into whether people are comfortable having their faces eyes fingers and voices recorded by giant financial companies — and whether the data is stored safely or sold to outside actors. There’s also the question of whether biometric data once assembled might be linked to a financial firm’s other activities most especially lending decisions. Without proper regulations companies would be able to factor your facial and voice data into its decision to lend to you.

At least three potential Biden nominees have connections to the financial technology industry.

Barr also previously advised the fintech firm Ripple which currently faces a multibillion-dollar lawsuit from the SEC. The SEC is charging that Ripple’s cryptocurrency XRP the third-largest worldwide is an unregistered security that serves no purpose other than to funnel sales to Ripple. (Bitcoin by comparison isn’t produced by a single company so it cannot be treated as a security; there’s no underlying asset that gains value if Bitcoin prices go up.) Ripple’s CEO was also interviewed by Brummer last year as part of “DC Fintech Week” an annual confab between industry regulators and political leaders that Brummer facilitates.

In response to the pushback against Barr The American Prospect reported that the White House is now considering California regulator Manuel Alvarez for the OCC job. Alvarez is even more directly linked to fintech. From 2014 to 2019 he was the chief legal officer at e-lender Affirm which offers “buy now pay later” loans at checkout for retail transactions as well as short-term loans aimed at consumers without credit cards. According to Consumer Reports Affirm loans can run as high as 30 percent APR.

Alvarez now leads California’s Department of Financial Protection and Innovation sometimes called “the mini Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.” But “innovation” refers to an office specifically set up to communicate with and encourage fintech development in California. Alvarez described the department’s goal to Yahoo Finance last week as to “proactively engage with fintech in a non-confrontational manner but also in a programmatic way so that we can try and … really develop a more holistic picture of innovation in financial services and then let that inform the rest of the department’s work — let it inform the supervisory work with respect to even existing licensees like our banks and credit unions.”

In an email to The Intercept a spokesperson for Alvarez said that he does not support the idea of letting industry players dictate the terms of regulation. “The DFPI is proud to be leading the nation in developing a regulatory framework that balances consumer protection and responsible financial innovation through expanded enforcement capabilities a market monitoring arm increased consumer outreach and early engagement with innovators” Alvarez’s statement read.

Joe Biden’s administration will also have to set itself apart from the Treasury Department under Barack Obama which actively encouraged private fintech development. Other parts of the federal government built active fintech incubators like OCC’s Responsible Innovation initiative and the CFPB’s Project Catalyst. Obama’s chief fintech policy adviser was Adrienne Harris who is now Barr’s close associate at the University of Michigan and an AIR board member. Harris also founded an online insurance company after leaving the Obama administration.

Obama’s OCC comptroller Thomas Curry (also on the AIR board) introduced a policy initiative called the special purpose bank charter in late 2016. A charter would bring fintech firms under OCC supervision but grant them the license to operate nationwide as special purpose national banks with their full suite of financial products and no deposit-taking requirements. Such proposals to charter fintechs would limit states’ regulatory powers and empower fintech firms to partner up with national banks potentially furthering consolidation of financial services into a handful of too-big-to-fail institutions. Both of Donald Trump’s appointments to the OCC attempted to implement Curry’s proposal despite opposition from state banking regulators. Sens. Sherrod Brown and Jeff Merkley opposed Curry’s push and the state of New York sued the OCC in 2020 after Acting Comptroller Brian Brooks reintroduced the fintech charter.

In California Alvarez has already pushed for other ways for fintech companies to sidestep regulation. A version of the legislation creating the “mini CFPB” that he helped draft but which was never enacted called for the state government to specifically encourage fintechs to register in California as industrial loan companies. This somewhat obscure charter would allow fintechs to take consumer deposits without being subject to federal banking regulation at all — a workaround to the OCC’s unwillingness to grant them bank charters. Of course Alvarez could reverse this if appointed to lead the OCC. Alvarez told S&P Global that his support for the industrial bank charters stemmed from an interest in keeping fintech firms based in California. “We cannot compel interested groups to apply in California” Alvarez wrote “but we can certainly provide a glidepath.”

Finally shadow banking  or lenders that don’t take deposits and aren’t subject to regulatory oversight are responsible for over 50 percent of the home and personal loan market in the United States. Fintech firms are a major part of this lending boom representing over a quarter of loan origination in 2015 while offering significantly higher rates than traditional banks and other shadow banking firms. And the lending gets even more dangerous when cryptocurrencies famously volatile are the medium of exchange. While still nascent this development in fintech activity will soon merit firm and appropriate regulatory responses from the CFPB the SEC and other relevant actors.

These turf fights over individual aspects of fintech or cryptocurrency are all ultimately proxies for a greater conflict: the “war on cash” and the right to a public nontraceable currency including on the internet said Rohan Grey a professor at Willamette University College of Law who studies financial technology and the history of money in an email. “Fintech” he wrote is just the newest brightest shiniest manifestation of a long struggle over public commerce.

“All the debates over ‘fintech’ once you get beyond the scams and the hype are really a debate about the future of money” said Grey. “The recent rise of ‘fintech’ is just the latest saga in a centuries-old struggle between democratic accountability and unaccountable private power with the latter hiding behind promises of technological innovation.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDEvMzAvd2hhdC1pcy1hLXNwYWMuaHRtbNIBN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tL2FtcC8yMDIxLzAxLzMwL3doYXQtaXMtYS1zcGFjLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What is a SPAC? Explaining one of Wall Street’s hottest trends,"American flags hang from the facade of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) building in New York January 28 2021.

What is a SPAC?

A special purpose acquisitions company is essentially a shell company set up by investors with the sole purpose of raising money through an IPO to eventually acquire another company. For instance Diamond Eagle Acquisition Corp. was set up in 2019 and went public as a SPAC that December. It then announced a merger with DraftKings and gambling tech platform SBTech. DraftKings began trading as a public company when the deal closed in April. So a SPAC has no commercial operations — it makes no products and does not sell anything. In fact the SPAC's only assets are typically the money raised in its own IPO according to the SEC. Usually a SPAC is created or sponsored by a team of institutional investors Wall Street professionals from the world of private equity or hedge funds while even high-profile CEOs like Richard Branson and fellow billionaire Tilman Fertitta have jumped on the trend and formed their own SPACs.

That's because when a SPAC raises money the people buying into the IPO do not know what the eventual acquisition target company will be. Institutional investors with track records of success can more easily convince people to invest in the unknown. That's also why a SPAC is also often called a ""blank check company."" Once the IPO raises capital (SPAC IPOs are usually priced at $10 a share) that money goes into an interest-bearing trust account until the SPAC's founders or management team finds a private company looking to go public through an acquisition. Once an acquisition is completed (with SPAC shareholders voting to approve the deal) the SPAC's investors can either swap their shares for shares of the merged company or redeem their SPAC shares to get back their original investment plus the interest accrued while that money was in trust. The SPAC sponsors typically get about a 20% stake in the final merged company. However SPAC sponsors also have a deadline by which they have to find a suitable deal typically within about two years of the IPO. Otherwise the SPAC is liquidated and investors get their money back with interest.

Why are SPACs suddenly popular?

SPACs have been around for decades and often existed as last resorts for small companies that would have otherwise had trouble raising money on the open market. But they've recently become more prevalent because of the extreme market volatility caused in part by the global pandemic. Many companies chose to postpone their IPOs (for fear that the market volitlity could spoil their stock's public debut). But others chose the alternate route to an IPO by merging with a SPAC. A SPAC merger allows a company to go public and get a capital influx more quickly than it would have with a conventional IPO as a SPAC acquisition can be closed in just a few months versus the ""grueling process"" process of registering an IPO with the SEC which can take up to six months. Also in a SPAC merger the target company is able to negotiate its own fixed valuation with the SPAC sponsors.

The firm expects the Form S-1 filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to become effective after the Commission completes its review.

Coinbase Aims For Direct Public Listing

CryptoPotato reported in December that the San Francisco California-based had submitted a draft registration with the SEC to go public with an initial public offering (IPO). Early estimations suggested that the company’s potential valuation was at nearly $30 billion.

The exchange released an update on its futures plans that contains a slight twist. Instead of going with the more traditional process of relying on large investment banks to set the price and line up for buyers for the shares Coinbase intends to go for a proposed direct listing of its Class A common stock.

“We believe a direct listing more closely follows the ethos of crypto and Coinbase because it democratizes access and opportunities for all investors.” – commented company CFO Alesia Haas.

Direct Public Listings (DPOs or simply direct listings) operate as alternatives to IPOs. During DPOs though the company doesn’t rely on raising outside capital as the employees and investors convert their ownership into stocks that are then listed on a stock exchange.

Upon the listing the general public including retail investors could purchase or dispose of their positions without the “lock-up” period of traditional IPOs.

Spotify and Slack were among the most prominent companies that went for a DPO instead of an IPO.

The First Of Many?

Shortly after Coinbase announced intentions to go public a few other cryptocurrency-related companies shared similar plans.

Bakkt the Bitcoin futures platform owned and operated by the Intercontinental Exchange was the first to do so. The statement highlighted a merger with a special purpose acquisition company and noted that Bakkt had an estimated enterprise value of $2.1 billion.

The Winklevoss twins the co-founders of another US-based cryptocurrency exchange Gemini also seemed fond of the idea. During a recent interview Tyler and Cameron said they were discussing going public and had internal conversations within the company on whether it made sense at this point.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFiYy5uZXQuYXUvbmV3cy8yMDIxLTAxLTMxL2thcmwtbWFyeC1hbHNvLWxpa2VkLXRvLWJldC1hZ2FpbnN0LXRoZS1zdG9jay1tYXJrZXQvMTMxMDYyMTTSASdodHRwczovL2FtcC5hYmMubmV0LmF1L2FydGljbGUvMTMxMDYyMTQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Even Karl Marx used his stimulus payment to bet against professional traders,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-01-31/karl-marx-also-liked-to-bet-against-the-stock-market/13106214 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFiYy5uZXQuYXUvbmV3cy8yMDIxLTAxLTMxL2thcmwtbWFyeC1hbHNvLWxpa2VkLXRvLWJldC1hZ2FpbnN0LXRoZS1zdG9jay1tYXJrZXQvMTMxMDYyMTTSASdodHRwczovL2FtcC5hYmMubmV0LmF1L2FydGljbGUvMTMxMDYyMTQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Strategic divestitures and cost management reflect a proactive approach to market challenges.

Legal and regulatory hurdles pose potential risks to IFF's operational stability.

Investment in R&D and productivity gains signal a commitment to innovation and efficiency.

International Flavors & Fragrances Inc (NYSE:IFF) a global leader in specialty ingredients production has recently disclosed its financial performance for the first quarter of 2024. Despite a slight decrease in net sales from $3.027 billion to $2.899 billion the company has shown an impressive increase in gross profit from $964 million to $1.024 billion indicating effective cost management and operational efficiency. As we delve into a SWOT analysis of IFF we'll explore the company's internal dynamics and external market conditions that could influence its strategic decisions and future growth.

Beyond the Balance Sheet: What SWOT Reveals About International Flavors & Fragrances Inc (IFF)

Strengths

Robust Gross Profit Margin Improvement: IFF's ability to increase its gross profit margin from 31.8% to 35.3% amidst a sales decline is a testament to its strong operational management. This improvement suggests that IFF has effectively controlled its cost of goods sold which decreased significantly by $188 million and has optimized its manufacturing processes to enhance profitability.

Strategic Divestitures and Portfolio Optimization: The company's strategic decision to divest certain business units such as the Savory Solutions and Flavor Specialty Ingredients (FSI) businesses reflects a focused approach to streamline operations and concentrate on core growth areas. These divestitures while impacting sales have allowed IFF to reallocate resources and reduce associated costs positioning it for more targeted growth.

Investment in Research and Development: IFF's commitment to innovation is evident in its increased R&D expenses which rose to $166 million. This investment is crucial for the company to maintain its competitive edge by developing new and improved products thereby ensuring long-term sustainability in a rapidly evolving industry.

Weaknesses

Dependence on Global Economic Conditions: IFF's performance is closely tied to global economic trends as seen in the impact of unfavorable exchange rates on its sales. The company's reliance on international markets exposes it to currency fluctuations and economic volatility which can affect its financial results.

Increased Selling and Administrative Expenses: The rise in S&A expenses to $490 million primarily due to higher legal fees and professional consulting costs indicates potential inefficiencies and increased overheads. These expenses if not carefully managed could erode the company's profitability over time.

Story continues

Legal and Regulatory Challenges: IFF faces ongoing legal proceedings and regulatory investigations such as the antitrust investigations into its fragrance businesses. These issues not only incur additional costs but also pose reputational risks and could lead to significant financial penalties.

Opportunities

Productivity Gains and Favorable Net Pricing: IFF has demonstrated the ability to achieve productivity gains and secure favorable net pricing as reflected in the increased Segment Adjusted Operating EBITDA for its Nourish and Scent segments. These achievements provide an opportunity for IFF to further enhance its operational efficiency and pricing strategies to boost profitability.

Focus on Health & Biosciences: The Health & Biosciences segment showed a sales increase indicating strong market demand for biotechnology-derived products. IFF's position in this segment offers significant growth potential particularly in the areas of probiotics enzymes and specialty ingredients which are increasingly sought after in the health and wellness markets.

Emerging Markets Expansion: With sales to Israeli and Russian customers representing a small percentage of total sales there is an opportunity for IFF to expand its presence in emerging markets. By leveraging its global footprint and diverse product portfolio IFF can tap into new customer bases and drive sales growth.

Threats

Competitive Industry Landscape: IFF operates in a highly competitive industry where innovation and customer preferences rapidly evolve. The company must continuously adapt to maintain its market position against competitors who may offer more innovative or cost-effective solutions.

Regulatory and Compliance Risks: The complexity of operating in multiple jurisdictions brings about various regulatory challenges. IFF's involvement in legal disputes and the necessity to comply with diverse regulations can lead to increased compliance costs and potential disruptions to its business operations.

Global Economic Uncertainties: Macroeconomic factors such as the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict and the potential impacts of the Israel-Hamas war could disrupt IFF's supply chains and affect its sales. The company must navigate these uncertainties while managing the risks associated with its international operations.

In conclusion International Flavors & Fragrances Inc (NYSE:IFF) exhibits a strong financial foundation with improved gross profit margins and strategic portfolio management. However the company must address its increased S&A expenses and navigate legal and regulatory complexities. Opportunities for growth lie in its Health & Biosciences segment and potential expansion into emerging markets. Nevertheless IFF must remain vigilant against competitive pressures and global economic uncertainties that pose threats to its operational stability. By leveraging its strengths and addressing its weaknesses IFF can capitalize on opportunities and mitigate threats positioning itself for continued success in the specialty ingredients industry.

For the complete transcript of the earnings call please refer to the full earnings call transcript.

Positive Points

International Flavors & Fragrances Inc (IFF Financial) achieved volume growth for the first time since Q1 2022 with mid-single digit growth in Q1 2024 driven by strong contributions from Scent Nourish and Health & Biosciences segments.

The company reported double-digit comparable adjusted EBITDA growth benefiting from both volume growth and productivity gains across its businesses.

International Flavors & Fragrances Inc (IFF) successfully closed the divestiture of its cosmetics ingredients business and announced the sale of its Pharma Solutions business which is expected to complete in the first half of 2025 aiding in strengthening the capital structure and focusing on high-growth areas.

The company is trending toward the upper end of its previously announced guidance ranges for the full year 2024 reflecting increased confidence in its financial outlook.

International Flavors & Fragrances Inc (IFF) introduced a refocused operating model which is business-led and supported by lean functions aimed at enhancing collaboration driving profitable growth and improving financial performance over time.

Negative Points

The CFO Glenn Richter announced his plan to retire at the end of 2024 initiating a succession plan that could lead to transitional challenges within the financial leadership of the company.

Despite positive volume growth the company noted that pricing was modestly positive and would have been negative without FX-related pricing benefits indicating underlying challenges in pricing power.

The company's Pharma Solutions segment experienced lower volumes due to ongoing destocking trends which could impact short-term performance until the completion of its divestiture.

International Flavors & Fragrances Inc (IFF) reported a negative free cash flow of $19 million in Q1 2024 although it was an improvement from the previous year highlighting ongoing challenges in cash flow generation.

The company's net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA ratio stood at 4.4x at quarter end indicating a relatively high leverage that the company aims to reduce to 3x following the Pharma Solutions transaction.

“Sometimes the ash was so thick you couldn't see five feet in front of you like being in a snowstorm or dense fog” W. Mae Jones said. Now in her eighties she’s lived there for a half-century.

When the cloud billowed youngsters darted home. Their mothers needed extra hands.

“If you didn’t bring the clothes in off the line you would get little brown and grey spots and have to wash everything again” Ruth Ballard said. The 85-year-old former nurse and lifelong resident recalled that “you would have to re-wash them wash your car out. The odor was terrible.”

Across from Ballard’s modest brick home dry sugarcane stalks rustle in the winter wind their long shadows rippling across a five-acre community garden mostly dormant under the dim sun and overhead power lines.

“They have greens turnips collards mustards kale broccoli tomatoes sweet potatoes Irish potatoes butterbeans” Ballard said.

For 70 years falling ash was an unavoidable part of life in the majority-Black community nestled among the wooded bayous and rivers just three miles north of downtown Mobile Alabama. The problem grew in the 1960s when Scott Paper expanded into one of the world’s largest mills next to IP local shorthand for International Paper.

Ballard said both mills offered free car washes to Africatown residents “anytime day or night.” Vehicles still corroded.

“It not only ate the paint but whatever the car was made out of it ate that too. Whatever the chemicals falling it was that potent” Ballard said.

Limited access to health care heightened the clouds’ more perilous costs.

“I have a sister and two brothers who died as a result of cancer” Ballard said. “Then another brother and myself are twice survivors of cancer.”

The youngest of her brothers was 65. Ruth Ballard has been clear for 14 years now.

“My husband died of cancer three years ago” Jones said.

When Rev. Chris L. Williams Sr. arrived at Africatown’s Yorktown Missionary Baptist Church in 2006 he was stunned.

“I think we had about 20 funerals right in a row that year” from a flock of about 200 the state trooper-turned-pastor recalled. “That's way out of normal.”

After talking to his congregation Williams sent a questionnaire into the community. Cancer was widespread. Williams looked at the heavy industry encircling Africatown: paper mills petroleum tanker farms power cement asphalt and chemical plants. He organized community meetings and called the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

“They told me it’s not a cluster and I told them you got all these people dying from cancer” Williams said. ‘They said it had to be this or that… They know what they’re talking about I guess.”

Williams contacted lawyers anyway. Prospective counsels’ initial enthusiasm faded.

“They would say ‘We know there’s something there’ and take soil samples then go and talk to whomever and come back and say ‘nothing’s there.’ Then they wouldn’t answer the phone anymore” Williams said.

North Alabama firm Stewart and Stewart finally took the case. When filed in 2017 the initial action listed 248 plaintiffs.

As legal motions were volleyed the story’s scope exploded thanks to an unprecedented historic discovery and a merciless unpunished crime that began a centuries-long saga.

Family Business

Africatown was a punctuation mark on centuries of terror.

When Maine native Timothy Meaher entered Mobile in 1835 it was a gateway to the American frontier. He and his brothers made fortunes in river traffic lumber and land.

Meaher wagered he could defy the 50-year-old federal law against importing African slaves. In July 1860 his schooner Clotilda with a belly full of kidnapped African souls slipped past the darkened city docks and toward vast tracts of Meaher-owned Mobile-Tensaw Delta land. In the canebrake and Spanish moss the perpetrators offloaded 110 frightened starving ill captives then steered the Clotilda upriver and set her ablaze.

News of the crime quickly blazed across the region with stories appearing in outlets as far away as Brooklyn. Federal agents arrested Meaher but he insisted he was on another of his ships and offered eyewitnesses. He was also friends with federal prosecutors and the judge. Charges were dropped.

After his release on bond Meaher moved the Africans between properties to elude detection by investigators. Eventually they were sold or divided up among the Meahers. Of them 16 men and 16 women went with Tim Meaher. His brothers took another 28 people.

On Jan. 10 1861 the case against two Meaher accomplices was eventually dismissed while the case against the Clotilda’s captain was continued. Alabama seceded from the Union the next day.

When they were finally emancipated after the Civil War the kidnapped Africans asked Meaher to return them to Africa. He refused. Gradually they bought small parcels from Meaher and built their own community in what was called Plateau. Raised self-determined and free the Africans lacked the deepest psychological shackles of many of the American-born Blacks around them.

“We are one of the few groups in America that know where we came from” Theodore Arthur said. A noted saxophonist Arthur identified himself as president of the original Africatown Direct Descendants of the Clotilda and a fourth-generation descendant of Clotilda captive Pollee Allen.

Arthur said he conferred with Sylviane Diouf for her award-winning and exhaustive 2007 book Dreams of Africa in Alabama. She called Africatown “the first [town] continuously controlled by Blacks the only one run by Africans.”

Those Africans planted the seeds of memory in new soil and grew something familiar. Their independence–they farmed hunted fished established their own business district school and governing structure– rankled many. In 1906 and 1907 lynchings occurred on Plateau/Africatown’s western edge. Those murders said historian David Alsobrook a former director of both the Clinton Presidential Library and the History Museum of Mobile felt like a message to Africatown’s population to “know their place.”

Weeks before the 1929 stock market crash the IP mill opened on land leased from the Meaher family between Africatown and the waterfront. Mobile County Probate deeds show IP finally purchased the land several decades later.

Meantime city sewer water and garbage pick-up were denied Africatown until the mid-‘60s according to a 1967 Southern Courier report. Residents complained that whites would sneak in to dump trash. When the city code required the Meahers to improve numerous shotgun shacks rented to Africatown residents they demolished the ramshackle homes instead.

“People have lived happy and healthy for years without running water and sewers” Tim Meaher’s grandson Augustine Jr. told a Southern Courier reporter. “He don’t need garbage service… He don’t need a bathtub – he’ll probably store food in it. Wouldn’t know how to use it.”

Almost simultaneously Mobile rezoned the area for heavy industry. The Southern Courier reported Scott Paper construction went up where the shacks once stood.

To date the Meahers still hold upwards of 260 acres in and around Africatown. Toxic industries lease much of that land.

In the late 1980s a new bridge was needed for the increasing flow of tractor trailers and tanker trucks barreling through Africatown. When its road was expanded to four lanes it wiped out Africatown’s central business district. That retail was never replaced.

In 2013 public attention turned to a Plains All-American tar sands pipeline carrying the caustic slurry under Africatown’s Mobile County Training School playground. Originally running into storage tanks near the Africatown-Cochrane Bridge over the Mobile River a scheduled flow reversal necessitated removal of the old pipe as a safety measure.

“That was probably the smart thing for Plains to do” President of the Mobile Environmental Justice Action Coalition Ramsey Sprague said. MEJAC was founded in 2013 by frustrated Africatown residents.

“The school system knew about [the pipeline] all along” activist and retired United States Marine Corps Major Joe Womack said. “So did a couple of people in the community but they never had the guts to stand up and tell anybody about it.”

The public fracas resulted in a $75000 donation from Plains All-American. It went toward a new baseball diamond and roof for the school.

Womack is wary of the Meaher family’s gradual acquisition of neighborhood property lots he claims appear derelict. He suspects they want it rezoned from residential to business.

“If my Mama’s house looked like that we’d get fined by the city” Womack said.

Womack cited the area’s population apex as over 10000 in the late 1960s—former pro baseball player and Africatown native Cleon Jones guessed 4000—but said it has winnowed to roughly 1700. The presence of four churches within its one-square-mile confines testify to once greater numbers.

City-data.com gave its median income as $25000 some $14000 less than Mobile’s overall median. Some Africatown homes appear sound. Several others are worn even dilapidated in testimony to the withering forces of Southern life.

Out of Sight Out of Time

In 1989 IP’s Mobile mill released more than 200000 pounds of carcinogenic chloroform normally associated with paper and pulp mills into the air. Three years later Scott Paper released 630000 pounds of chloroform according to the Birmingham News.

Kimberly-Clark absorbed Scott Paper in 1995. Mobile operations continued.

In 1999 Environmental Protection Agency scientists said a dozen dangerous pollutants were found in the air near Africatown with chloroform 100 times higher than safe levels. Among the volatile organic compounds were chloromethane benzene and ethylbenzene hexane naphthalene and toluene.

The federal government began regulating highly toxic dioxins with the 1990 Clean Air Act. In 2000 IP announced the closing of their Mobile mill.

“Ten years is about the time you would expect the largest paper company in the world to explore litigating getting around those types of regulations and in the end deciding they'd rather close shop than conform” Sprague said.

“IP bulldozed everything the whole plant left everything in the ground” Womack said. Most of the massive tract is vacant now covered in tall grasses and scrubby trees. Cracked concrete stumps jut from the former foundation. A pipe company occupies the easternmost portion.

Womack and others claim proper remediation of dioxins and furans was avoided. Sprague went to the Alabama Department of Environmental Management’s (ADEM) offices in Montgomery the state capital to find the exit plan IP is required to file.

“I met with [ADEM Director] Lance LeFleur and asked about IP’s plan. He said ‘It’s here’ and looked but couldn’t find it” Sprague said. “He called his solid waste guy in to look also and they couldn’t find it in any of their electronic or physical files.”

LeFleur said he couldn’t recall a one-on-one meeting with Sprague though records indicated Sprague attended a pair of group meetings. ADEM’s online e-file system showed no specific remediation plans for the IP site.

“There are only certain circumstances where hazardous waste was either in the ground water or in the soil where a formal remediation plan is required” LeFleur said. That determination is made by regular ADEM inspection.

Previous EPA citations didn’t surprise LeFleur. He pointed to the difference in levels of pollutants.

“You know I live in an older home and they used to burn coal for heating and put ashes out in the backyard so there’s coal ash in my backyard but it doesn’t rise to the level of hazardous waste” LeFleur said.

Mobile’s Baheth Research and Development Laboratories began sample collection around Africatown during Phase I third-party evaluations including topographical and historical studies for PCB generators and effects on water soil and wildlife.

“That’s what made a case for $1.8 billion” Baheth’s Raoul Richardson said.

IP’s revenue was $21.743 billion in 2017 and $22.4 billion in 2019. Early that year a local reporter’s discovery of the Clotilda wreckage upriver from Africatown was announced. Covered in silt and muddy water for 160 years it arose and rejuvenated the 110 captives’ tale.

The emergence of “the last slave ship” rang globally. National Geographic visited as did network news reporters and Benin Ambassador Hector Posset.

Around the same time Zora Neale Hurston’s book Barracoon: The Story of the Last ""Black Cargo"" was finally published 90 years after she had finished it. The work is based on her 1927 visits with Cudjo Lewis the last surviving Africatown founder.

Museum ideas materialized. Dreams of historic renewal bloomed. Womack and others pushed for a “blueway” a recreational trail utilizing area waterways.

Meanwhile additional plaintiffs in the IP lawsuit swelled past 1000. Local asphalt maker H.O. Weaver and Sons were added as defendants and the case was remanded from federal court to Mobile circuit court in May 2017.

Richardson said Baheth Labs sent their report to Stewart and Stewart and a summary to MEJAC. Then he heard the law firm had contracted another lab for an additional report.

As COVID-19 spread plaintiffs received news of a tentative settlement. A letter from Stewart and Stewart dated May 29 2020 told one plaintiff: “When we began working on this case we believed that we wound [sic] find significant amounts of pollution in the community. However this did not prove to be the case. First the soil testing we performed showed that the dioxin and furan pollution was merely at background levels meaning the amounts were no different on the Africatown property than from anywhere else.”

The letter encouraged the plaintiff to agree to the “satisfactory settlement.” Though they varied the highest figure mentioned among plaintiffs was $8000. Rev. Williams said he knew of others who received as little as $200.

The settlement terms required 95 percent of plaintiffs to agree and sign releases prohibiting future action. Without that minimal percentage the letter said no one would receive settlement funds.

There were no specifics on attorney fees in the letter. According to plaintiffs the firm initially said their fees would be up to 40 percent of the final settlement.

Amidst the pandemic’s economic downturn 1090 plaintiffs signed off. A joint dismissal of complaint was filed Nov. 2 2020.

“As we have stated since this case was filed we categorically deny the allegations made by the plaintiffs. Nevertheless we determined it to be in IP’s best interest to resolve their claims. The terms of this resolution are confidential and may not be disclosed by the parties” Tom Ryan of IP said in a Jan. 11 2021 statement.

“We found tremendous amounts of contaminants that we know are known carcinogens that would definitely adversely impact their health and safety” Richardson said.

Baheth Labs’ paperwork mentioned “persistent organic pollution” or POP levels of 3000 micrograms per kilogram in soil and water samples. That included eight dioxins furans and PCBs in its congener group.

“The EPA and World Health Organization have determined that concentrations greater than 0.00003 are known carcinogens” the report read.

Lab founder M. Allam Baaheth said their work was verified by a second lab.

In a 2016 report The World Health Organization described dioxins as tied to elevated cancer rates. Its decay rate was defined as long-lasting estimated between seven to 11 years. Chlorine bleaching of paper pulp was listed as a major source.

Once in the air the toxins eventually permeate water soil and more. Although lipophilic and drawn to fatty tissue those poisons could affect a community garden too.

“If you eat the vegetables if the last time you ate it was in 2000 and 2005 that stuff would still be in your body. In fish from the waterways there would be more in chickens more in pork even more” Richardson said.

POP effects are cumulative. Their long-term concentration in humans is found through blood and human milk samples not soil.

“We never got to do those tests” Richardson said.

Baaheth was more plain-spoken. “If you’re eating the fish out of Hog Bayou up there you’re going to die” he said.

Despite numerous inquiries plaintiff attorneys Stewart & Stewart declined comment on this story.

Old Songs New Verses

By 2012 court records cited Meaher family real estate company assets at $35 million including 22000 acres of land timber plus rental income and cash. Tax records show their corporation paid $20 million in property taxes.

The family which declined comment for this story has traditionally remained quiet about the Clotilda saga. In 2018 Augustine Meaher III told a West Coast reporter his great grandfather Tim wasn’t responsible. He blamed Clotilda Capt. William Foster.

In literature on the Mobile River’s “chemical corridor” of 25 manufacturers the Mobile Chamber of Commerce ballyhooed ADEM’s “fast-track permitting” and ability to work with businesses.

In early 2020 details for the Africatown Heritage House were unveiled. The museum—planned adjacent to the schoolyard with a pipeline less than a quarter mile from the old IP location—will usher visitors through historic Mobile West Africa the Middle Passage and feature artifacts from the Clotilda. Boat and land tours are sought as well.

Mobile Mayor Sandy Stimpson and other political leaders think Africatown can generate tourist dollars like Montgomery’s National Lynching Memorial. Stimpson has his own generational imprint there. His family’s lumberyard and wood treatment facility sprawls across 30 acres of what was once Africatown’s Lewis Quarters neighborhood. They sold the entire outfit in 2013 for more than $80 million.

In the international community a dialogue has disseminated to include gender in migration research and highlight divergence among experiences for migrant women. Gender differences impact who migrates and to where the risks associated with migration how people migrate and utilize their networks resources available and ties maintained with the country of origin (IOM 2019). It is fundamental in gendered migration discussions to understand how the foundations and changes to gender power dynamics roles and expectations are altering the flow of female migration. Alterations to migration trends have related labor market needs to the reasons why women may be migrating. In fact more female migrants are migrating independently for work education or to fulfill a role as head of household (Migration Data Portal 2020). The presence of migrant women in the labor force is also greater than that of non-migrant women in all countries except those of low-income (Migration Data Portal 2020). To further examine the gender-specific experiences of migrant women and how these experiences are reflected in the global labor force this paper will seek to answer the following question: What driving factors produce the decision to migrate among female labor migrants?

Most studies on migration have typically only focused on males or combine the migration patterns of both men and women into one category (Boyd 1989; DaVanzo 1978; Todaro 1969; Pessar & Mahler 2003; Boyd & Grieco 2003). The unique experiences of female migrant workers are also often overlooked in the scholarly community because of the perpetuated assumption that women either migrate as dependents of a male breadwinner or are left behind by their husbands who have emigrated (Pedraza 1991). Even the general assumptions which consider women in the migration process at all still place them as a secondary actor to male migrants. However female migrant workers have a dominant force in migration trends and their experiences are distinct from their male counterparts. In fact the female presence in labor flows into the United States has been increasing for several decades (Donato 1994; Sassen-Koob 1984). Globally the number of female migrants relative to population has been steadily inclining with 79.6 million emigrated in 1995 and 130.2 million in 2019 (Migration Data Portal 2019).

There are several risks associated with female migration. While migrants in general are subject to the lowest wages female migrants in particular are increasingly targeted for dead-end and often temporary low-wage work (Fernandez-Kelly 1994; Fernandez-Kelly & Garcia 1988). Overall migrant women are more highly exploited due to lower wages risky working conditions and the types of jobs available to them. Highly-skilled migrant women are very often underemployed and receive less pay and status for their qualifications and this has been observed in developed countries such as New Zealand (Fleury 2016). Female migrant workers have a dominant role in the service sector including domestic work as well as garment and microelectronic industries (Fernandez-Kelly & Garcia 1988; Boyd & Grieco 2003). For undocumented workers in sectors such as domestic work there are many workers’ rights violations that occur consistently including sexual harassment lack of payment for services and extended work hours (Chavez 1992).

The risks surrounding migration do not discount the agency of migrant women. In fact women have a fundamental role not only in improving their own migration conditions but also a wide scope of transnational interactions. The theories which best convey this role also serve as a more pragmatic model for international migration than traditional interpretations. The next sections will examine various viewpoints to determine the reasons why women migrate and apply relevant theories to critically examine such claims. This paper will analyze sex-disaggregated data on female migration and reach the conclusion that the world systems model is the most authentic indicator of the determinants for women to migrate and work abroad.

Push-pull theories of migration originate from Ernst Ravenstein’s “Laws of Migration” (Ravenstein 1876 1885 1889). The major extensions of the laws which address gender conclude that females are more migratory than males over shorter distances males are more present in international migration than females and the primary causes of migration are universally economic (King 2012). Ravenstein’s research has launched subsequent studies to introduce a mathematical model consisting of various factors which “push” migrants out of a given country and “pull” them into another (Dorigo & Tobler 1983; Lee 1966; Tobler 1987). Thus the original push-pull model for migration has been expanded to incorporate a varying series of push and pull factors at different degrees of influence to predict migration patterns.

While Ravenstein’s initial laws found economic factors to dictate both push and pull factors more recent studies have found that a multitude of “push” factors can more accurately predict migration than “pull” factors (Jenkins 1977; Massey et al. 1994). These conditions include the state of economic development institutional conditions governmental policies and regime of the country one emigrates from (Jenkins 1977; Massey et al. 1994). Push-pull theories create an equation for various causes of migration relative to the actual outcome of migration but do not necessarily capture however the structural inequalities within systems of international migration. The push-pull model often neglects other significant influences such as historical implications family dynamics and sociopolitical and economic dependency between nations (O’Reilly 2013). Legacies of colonization for example account for the relations between groups and states across borders and maintain economic political interpersonal and social ties between postcolonial and colonizing states.

The microeconomic model of migration observes individuals and their households to indicate that people are more likely to migrate to maximize their own human capital. Microeconomic theories are often perceived as idealistic because they provide human agency to the study of migration and emphasize the importance of an individual’s decision to emigrate from their country of origin (Wood 1982). Models which highlight the agency of one’s own decision to migrate are particularly relevant to the migration of women as female migrants are often overlooked as main actors in migratory processes. DaVanzo (1978) found that families whose heads of household are unemployed or dissatisfied with their current jobs are more likely to emigrate than those not looking for work. While this finding is significant the study did not observe single-parent households nor the wages or employment of wives. Therefore it cannot be determined if the employment status of women specifically is an indicator of family migration as interpreted through this micro data model.

Household units in migration have been criticized in previous scholarship due to their lack of representation of the role of women in labor migration (Matthei 1996). It is significant that women are especially active in determining the migration of themselves in addition to their kin and children (Matthei 1996). Traditional household measures also lack inclusion of single-mother households divorced or separated women and single women who have never been married. As such this interpretation is inadequate when considering a wider range of family migration of which the decision to marry or divorce may be a determinant of the decision to migrate (Mincer 1978). One study which observed three Asia-Pacific countries found that microeconomic theory could be applied to highly skilled migrant workers but family and lifestyle conditions were also prominent determinants of emigration and return migration (Gibson & McKenzie 2009). This literature suggests that economic prospects alone do not provide a sufficient model for family or female migration.

The world systems approach views migration as an indicator of interactions between countries and within a transnational lense of communication and movement. When applied to female migration it can reveal how women contribute to an international network of migrant communities and employment opportunities. While social networks have been identified as a fundamental role in the decision to migrate relevant literature often neglects the significance of women by assuming they are the dependents of male counterparts or are absorbed into the household (Massey et al. 1989). On the contrary Barbara Pinto in her experience as an immigration attorney in the United States has observed that many if not most of the women who seek out immigration services are single and not a member of any other household (Pinto 2020). In developing and underdeveloped countries more women are emigrating independently and not as a dependent or household member (Sorensen 2004). Prior research on migrants from countries in Central America Southeast Asia and Europe indicate that women utilize their international social networks to arrange their own transportation to migrate (Hondagneu-Sotelo Triano & Phizacklea 1996; Georges & Wiest 1990; Stivens 1987; Singh 2006; Richter 2004). Furthermore female migrants are found to assist each other in acquiring jobs upon arrival (Chavez 1992). However this advantage in transnational networking applies particularly to women in domestic and low-paying work rather than professional or highly-skilled women (Hagan 1998).

Transnational migration is a more recent characterization to describe migrants who settle in a new country but maintain close ties with their country of origin. A study on the transnational connections of migrants from St. Vincent Grenada the Philippines and Haiti finds that these economic political and social ties encourage migrants to remain invested in the family relationships and economic stability of their home countries and this often results in return migration (Shiller Basch & Blanc 1995). Transnationalism may serve as a strong indicator of the decision to emigrate or for return migration among modern migrants and this complex movement contributes to culturally multi-layered communities. Social remittances between sending and receiving countries allow transnational communities to “adopt certain new ideas and practices while filtering out others” (Levitt 1998 943-944). Women are particularly active in sending financial remittances to family in their country of origin and female migrant domestic workers in New York have been known to use between 20 to 75 percent of their income for remittances (Colen 1986). Female migrants also initiate “child fostering”[1] with family to participate in international labor migration (Matthei 1996).

Since migrants build a strong community presence with time in receiving countries social ties and economic reliance also emerge from their movements. I predict that these ties between the country of origin and the receiving country provide more certainty in international migration systems and contribute significantly to the decision to migrate among migrant women. Transnational feminism refers to an anti-war activist movement which was predominantly active during WWI and WWII of which feminists contributed to the establishment of transnational networks and cooperation to achieve peace while solving global issues. I argue that this movement may also apply to the laws of migration in that the migration experiences of women who seek something that is lacking at home work or in the community largely contribute to transnationalism. This can be exemplified through the collaborative networks between female migrants which determine their movement to receiving countries as well as their financial stability upon arrival and those which launch the international migration of other women. The impact of these networks applies to economic systems and the various sectors that female migrant workers have a considerable presence in and additionally to the establishment of immigrant communities which occurs over time. Hence I propose that transnational networks cause women in particular to migrate and seek work abroad. This hypothesis can be drawn from the world systems theory because it considers the foundations that have been established through historical interactions between states and their peoples and how this applies to the structure of those power relationships today. These foundations include the settlement and movement of migrants into the global labor force and the unique treatment and experiences of women in these systems.

Following the rise in women’s migration a feminist perspective has developed for transnational migration and this field of study identifies how gender inequalities differentiate migration experiences along with divisions in labor and care services (Parreñas 2009; Boyd & Grieco 2003). The gendered lens on migration highlights the social institutions surrounding race and gender which contribute to contrastive experiences between men and women. Some of these differences such as a tendency to rely more on family ties among women have been interpreted through the development of this paper. However targeting gender-specific indicators for the decision to migrate is less approached in literature as the answers lie within a complex web of theories which are applied distinctly to each type of migration: such as labor temporary refugee illegal and permanent (Boyd & Grieco 2003). Differences among the experiences of female migrants and the decision to migrate have also been observed in the context of the location of sending and receiving communities or countries (Ghosh 2009).

According to the 2004 World Survey on the Role of Women in Development female migrants have a growing presence as migrant workers and more often move voluntarily “to become the principal wage earners for their families” (2004 World Survey 2006). This finding may indicate that migrant women chose to migrate for work to improve their own human capital job security or work opportunities which supports the microeconomic model. It could also suggest that women seek to exert control over their own movement and capital concertedly and this conclusion can explain transnational networking among women while rejecting the household model. Migration has also been found to advance the autonomy capital self-esteem authority and value placed within families and communities social equality access to services and reproductive political and human rights for women (Fleury 2016).

Education and employment rates have ubiquitous influence on migration trends and its relation to working women’s decision to migrate varies across region and status. Indigent or underserved women are more likely to migrate in Sri Lanka and Bangladesh higher education and employment rates in Mexico lead more women to migrate and high employment and dissatisfaction in job positions indicate the intent to migrate among Moroccan women (Fleury 2016). Despite the variations in these findings it is evident that education level and job satisfaction motivate emigration and specific movements. Further observations expand on gender norms structural inequalities and gender discrimination at home and in the community as major driving factors towards a woman’s decision to migrate from countries in Africa South Asia Central America and Europe (Fleury 2016). Social networks within the transnational and at home stimulate international migration among women. In El Salvador and Morocco women who migrate reduce the stigma and uncertainty associated with migration for other women (Mahler 1999; Crivello 2003).

An increase in global female workforce participation and reduced access to social services in developed countries has led to a dependency from high-income countries on the labor force of low-income countries (Omelaniuk 2005 as cited by Ehrenreich and Hochschild 2002). This dynamic between developed and lesser developed states has expanded the reliance on globalized economies and opened up various work opportunities in service sectors for migrant women (Omelaniuk 2005 as cited by Sassen 2003). This finding supports world systems and dependency models as it places female migration at the center of the exploitation by “core” wealthy countries of the resources (including labor) in “periphery” underdeveloped countries for a cheaper cost. While there are several benefits for women to migrate including elevating their economic independence and human capital work opportunities may still be limited to the demands of developed or emerging countries. For female migrants from countries that are integrated into specific sectors of the global economy such as the Philippines and India in the medical care industry the appeal to migrate may become more secure.

Previous research has developed several key findings on changes in the determinants of female migration as well as demographic shifts among migrant women. Global competition and its leverage on the labor market have led more migrant women to seek work in the service sector rather than agriculture and manufacturing (Pew Research 2006). As migrant women have become more dominant in the service sector it may indicate that their essential presence in specific markets is contributing to the rise in female migration. Additionally women are migrating more often to gain control over their mobility and standard of living and this reflects a liberalization in gender relations (Pew Research 2006). Since women also migrate to reap the benefits of greater socio-political freedom gaining control over some aspect that is not immediately accessible is a theme among intent to migrate. Female migrants are becoming more educated since 1980 regardless of region of origin and age less are migrating during their youth or childhood and less are arriving married or having ever been married (Pew Research 2006). The increase in education among female migrants can reflect global efforts directed at equal access to education and youth enrolment especially in rural areas. The increasingly single movement of female migrants may be the effect of altered gender relations which determine intent to migrate.

The expansion of female migration has allowed for a more gender-balanced flow of international migration. Significantly the increase in the migration of women is true among both the lesser-skilled and highly-skilled with more highly-skilled women emigrating from less economically developed countries (Dumont Martin & Spielvogel 2007). Literature from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) notes that the rise in international mobility of highly-skilled migrant women is disproportionate to the general migrant population when considering that women face unequal access to secondary education compared to men (Dumont Martin & Spielvogel 2007). This raises further questions as to the causes for women with a higher education to be more inclined to migrate particularly from lesser developed countries.

Notably women assist each other whether intentionally or indirectly in expanding women’s international migration and migrant work opportunities across every region. There is a connection between gender-specific benefits of migration and the intent to migrate for better wages or jobs wider enjoyment of civil liberties and authority over one’s own capital and security. There are also gendered risks involved in both the movement to a receiving country and treatment upon arrival. Female migrants often rely on the previous migration experiences of other women as well as their connections to communities in both the sending and receiving countries to lower these risks. Both limited education and a higher education correspond to the intent of women to migrate and improved employment rates in the sending region may influence the actual opportunities or perception of job opportunities within the receiving community.

Based on the data interpreted through this paper it is suggested that the world systems theory is the most accurate model in explaining why female labor migrants choose to migrate. The complexity of transnational networking and international mobility can reflect the multidimensional conditions which influence female migration. More women are emigrating single and the desire for better work opportunities and status elevation in another country may be reassured in the experiences of generational populations of migrant women. Established transnational networks lower the risks for both single women and women with children. There is a greater affirmation of security upon arrival that is specifically adapted to the migrant woman’s distinct experience in networking. Additionally these connections are likely to lower the risks associated with transportation immigration status lack of community low capital and limited job opportunity. Furthermore international labor demands have placed migrant women in a role where they do not compete with non-migrants within their sectors in developed and emerging countries. Since this is not true of migrants received in lesser developed countries the dynamic between states illustrates the role of migration in the global economy and labor force. Additionally less job opportunities in low-income countries and a prominent desire for economic independence can indicate why more women are migrating for work. In conclusion the differences in female migration between higher and lower income countries supports the world systems model.

In consideration of the previous discussion I suggest further research to identify differences in the experiences and decision to migrate between highly and lowly skilled female workers. As indicated in the above data there are discrepancies between these groups such as the advantages of networking. While some findings suggest that high employment can be indicative of the migration of women this may better suggest limited accessibility to resources or obstructions to advancement while employed. Further research on the motives for return migration among women and its effects would advance the study of gendered migration as transnationalism is known to be incorporated into this movement of people.

With the documented experiences of migrant women in mind I note that many countries around the world require a complete reconstruction of their immigration policy to meet international migration demands and basic standards of human dignity. While exploitation violence and discrimination against migrants have gendered connotations it is endured by all migrants at varying degrees consistent with intersectional analysis. Thus comprehensive and universal policy must be applied to protect the human and working rights of all migrants while acknowledging women’s experiences and vulnerabilities. Specifically I recommend policy to ensure migrants have equal access to resources including legal medical reproductive educational financial and basic needs. Policy should aim to protect migrant and immigrant communities against discrimination and violence at work at home in public and on the move. Protections of migrant working rights must be implemented equally regardless of immigration status. It is encouraged that all government agencies and immigration officials be closely monitored and directed to uphold migrant rights.

[1] “Child Fostering” refers to an interaction between female kin to launch transnational migration. When a woman migrates and leaves her children with family in the country of origin she may send remittances to family for child care and economic security. The women receiving remittances are then able to build enough capital to secure their own migration.

Printed neatly across the top of the card in black ink was Hetzler's name. Below the manufacturer and batch number of the COVID-19 vaccine that had just gone into her upper arm. The date she received her shot — eight remarkable numbers — was written on the right.

""Holding that card is like holding hope"" said Hetzler 45 who has worked at an assisted living facility in Mission B.C. for the past nine years and received both doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.

""It's been a hard year for health-care workers a hard year for anyone who works in long-term care assisted living and to have that in our hands ... it's what we've been praying for and hoping for this whole year. Just waiting for an answer. Waiting for the change. Waiting for some hope to come that this is going to be over.""

People who receive a COVID-19 vaccine get a card showing which vaccine they had and when each dose was administered. The full vaccination record in B.C. will be entered into an online provincial database but British Columbians are also able to ask for a hard copy of their official record to keep with them.

Experts say the hard copies could bring about emotions that simply don't come from lines of letters glowing on a screen — after an exhausting year a piece of blue-and-gold cardstock is physical evidence the pandemic might actually be coming to an end.

""It has this meaning attached to it"" said psychologist Christine Korol director of the Vancouver Anxiety Centre.

""The reason why something tangible can be so meaningful can vary from person to person [but] everyone's been waiting waiting waiting.... Everybody's wondering how much longer they're going to have to go forward with this"" she continued.

""So anything that signals hope.""

WATCH: Hetzler recorded a video after getting her first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine:

Paper can be better

Printed immunization record cards continue to be used in B.C. and around the world even in the advent of digital storage. Not everybody has ready access to a doctor who can access their online records or a stable internet connection to do it themselves. Some people simply prefer keeping track of their information at home. Plus hard copies prevail when online databases crash as they're known to do.

Internationally paper cards were important after previous epidemics for people who travelled. ""Yellow Cards"" are still used as proof of vaccination against yellow fever since the epidemic of the 1960s and there was once a requirement for international travellers to prove they were vaccinated for smallpox before the disease was declared eradicated in 1980.

An example of the immunization card that will be given to people who receive a COVID-19 vaccine in B.C. (Supplied by the B.C. Ministry of Health)

So even though hard copies are nothing unusual it's hard to know how attached people might become to paper records after the COVID-19 pandemic ends because there isn't a modern-day precedent as far as health crises go.

""We don't have any sort of comparable evidence to say ... 'Oh five years later everyone was still clutching their dog-eared cards and using them to do whatever"" said Heather MacDougall historian of medicine public health and health policy at the University of Waterloo.

""It provides the people who received the shots and receive the cards with a sense of reassurance that they've done their bit for themselves their families and their community. And they've got proof that they can hold in their hand that they did this.""

Immunization records are sure to have a complex effect on B.C.'s plans to control the pandemic and revive the economy as it moves out of pandemic life. The province hasn't yet laid out any scenarios in which it will require proof of vaccination — to travel for instance — but public health officials will be looking at the records.

The Ministry of Health said in a statement Thursday the online database of COVID-19 vaccine records will be accessible to ""public health leaders who require that kind of information in order to plan the ongoing control of the pandemic and the history of immunity in the province.""

Before those decisions begin the province must first get the immunizations done. Production delays mean B.C. will receive a reduced shipment of both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines in the next two weeks frustrating officials.

In the meantime Hetzler keeps her card close.

""I'm very fearful of losing it"" she said. ""I keep it with me at all times."""

Risk-reducing buffered ETFs that aim to take some of the danger out of investing in stock markets enjoyed a banner year in 2020 with a surge in the number of launches and assets under management.

However a push by a grouping of the exchange traded fund industry’s biggest players could potentially derail the fast-growing sector by stripping funds of their designation as ETFs.

Buffered or defined outcome ETFs provide investors with a degree of downside protection if the stock market falls. In return investors give up some of the potential gains only receiving the return of the underlying index up to a fixed preset cap if it rises over the contract period.

The most recent monthly edition of the Innovator S&P 500 Power Buffer ETF (PJAN) for example launched on January 2 protected investors against the first 15 per cent of any loss over the subsequent 12 months in return for any gains being capped at 9.75 per cent. The cap and protection change every time the ETF resets.

Buffered funds enjoyed a breakthrough year in 2020 with 65 launches (up from the previous record of 19 in 2019) accounting for more than 20 per cent of all ETF debuts in the US according to data from FactSet.

Early movers such as Innovator ETF First Trust Pacer and TrueShares have been joined by an insurance company arm — Allianz Investment Management — for the first time which has been managing similar strategies in an insurance wrapper for decades.

Total buffered ETF assets have surged from $300m to $5bn in the past 12 months according to Allianz.

John Southard co-founder and chief investment officer of Innovator Capital Management the early industry leader with about $3.5bn of assets in defined outcome ETFs said take-up was driven in part by extremely low bond yields.

Investors need to know with one click what type of instrument they are buying

“It’s for the investor who says ‘I want to stay invested in the market but I want some downside buffer in place. Maybe I’m late in my investing cycle. I’m withdrawing money from my retirement account so I can’t afford a big downdraft’” said Mr Southard who with Bruce Bond chief executive co-founded PowerShares which later became Invesco’s ETF arm.

Yet the tried and tested formula of a 60/40 portfolio of equities and bonds has become less attractive as “bond yields are so low people don’t want 40 per cent of their portfolio in something yielding 1-2 per cent so advisers are having to look for alternatives” said Mr Southard. Amid record high markets investors “scared” of a market crash are also potential buyers he said.

Johan Grahn vice-president portfolio management at Allianz IM said it had seen a “tremendous reception to the ETFs” since the rollout of its initial buffered fund in June heralded the German insurance company’s first-ever foray into ETFs.

“We have many decades of managing these strategies for the insurance side of the business” said Mr Grahn. “We manage $150bn of risk around the world and a lot of the underlying structures are the same as for the ETFs.

We don’t want to be unfairly put in a category that would create confusion . . . Just because we have options in our portfolios does not mean we have additional risk. In fact we are lower risk

“We are now taking some of that expertise that we have built up over time and building that into an ETF.”

Mr Grahn said defined outcome ETFs were “solving an age-old problem in a very elegant way” in that it allowed a “de-risking of equity exposure” and their arrival was “a function of the ETF market evolving”.

“The market really earned its spurs in 2020. These strategies held up really well in [the market sell-off] in March. That was a gift to the industry” said Mr Grahn whose ETFs have so far attracted $135m of assets.

So far buffered ETFs are only available in the US.

Mr Southard said Innovator had preliminary discussions about launching products in Europe but given the bank-dominated distribution model in parts of the continent had decided to focus on the US.

Thus far most products are based on US equity indices although Innovator has three further ETFs linked respectively to developed market equities ex-US emerging markets and US investment grade bonds.

Further growth could be slowed however if a grouping of the ETF industry’s most powerful players gets its way.

The asset managers have proposed that buffered ETFs should lose the “ETF” designation and instead be called exchange traded instruments a move that could slow their take-up in an investor community that has become familiar with the ETF label.

The consortium of BlackRock State Street Vanguard Charles Schwab Fidelity Investments and Invesco which between them control more than 90 per cent of the US ETF market wrote to US regulators last year calling for “clearer identification and categorisation of exchange traded products”.

Specifically it argued that “certain ETPs with complex structures and/or certain embedded risks” should be categorised as exchange traded notes (ETNs) commodities (ETCs) or instruments (ETIs) rather than as ETFs.

“Investors need to know with one click what type of instrument they are buying” said Anna Paglia global head of ETFs and indexed strategies at Invesco.

“ETFs were created as plain vanilla types of vehicles to get exposure to market returns but the market has evolved dramatically. Right now we have a variety of instruments that go by the name ETFs.”

However buffered ETF providers are unhappy that under the proposals the vehicles would be rebranded as ETIs alongside leveraged and inverse ETFs which use derivatives to increase risk rather than reduce it.

Mr Grahn pointed out the products would be harder to market “if you have to put a different label on it and explain it”.

“We don’t want to be unfairly put in a category that would create confusion” said Mr Southard. “Just because we have options in our portfolios does not mean we have additional risk. In fact we are lower risk.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

When you visit San Diego you can plan both gentle scenic walks and more strenuous hikes. If you’re looking for an adventure that takes an entire morning or afternoon plan for one of the longer hikes. And with few rainy days and moderate temperatures all year San Diego is the perfect place to spend time outdoors.

Here are great options for more in-depth exploring out in nature. Pack a lunch and stop for a picnic. Sit on a rock and rest while you take in the views. And if these trails appeal to you they are all doable in a shorter time if you go partway and turn back to your car whenever you need to.

1. Enjoy Panoramic Views At Torrey Pines State Natural Reserve

If you have time for only one hike in San Diego make it to the Torrey Pines State Natural Reserve. This gem of San Diego hikes will take your breath away with panoramic views of the ocean from paths that wind along lacy sandstone cliffs high above the beach.

Torrey Pines hiking options include five trails from easy to more challenging. You can even hike from the cliffs down to the water using a stairway. Check out the trails before you arrive and figure out which to go on in the time you have. You can easily pick two or three as they connect at different points.

The flattest is The Guy Fleming Trail. This loop just off the parking lot is only two-thirds of a mile and features two scenic overlooks. Wildflowers ferns and Torrey pines line the trail.

The Parry Grove Trail covers a half-mile. It’s steep and has more than 100 stone steps to navigate. High Point Trail is also steep and has steps. The view from this trail is stunning.

To reach ocean overlooks take the Razor Point Trail or the Beach Trail both a bit under a mile long. If you’re looking for the stairs down the sand these are part of the Beach Trail.

The Broken Hill Trail is the longest at 1.3 miles south or 1.4 miles north. Wind through chaparral and sagebrush and you will reach an overlook. From here you can clearly see the beautiful eroding sandstone cliffs.

As you hike look for the Torrey Pines dotting the area. These short scrubby pines grow only two places in the world: Here in La Jolla and on Santa Rosa Island. The trees are an endangered species and are protected so they will continue to thrive in Torrey Pines. Stay on the paths and respect this treasure of nature as you hike.

Pro Tip: You can drive up from the beach to the hiking area and park in lots at the top of the hill. If you want a more strenuous hike park at the beach and walk up the steep road for about 20 minutes of cardio.

2. Savor The Views From The Point Loma Bayside Trail

Cabrillo National Monument in Point Loma is famous for the historic lighthouse perched on the hill overlooking San Diego Bay. Many visitors miss the fun hiking trail from the bluff down to the shoreline. The Point Loma Bayside Trail winds down the hill from the lighthouse. Round trip after you turn around and head back up is 2.5 miles.

The entire hike gives you panoramic views of the water with sailboats gliding gracefully along. Ballast Point is on the tip of land where explorer Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo landed in 1542. You can also gaze upon downtown San Diego Coronado Island and Tijuana Mexico.

As you trace the path bordered by sandstone cliffs watch for park signs that tell about the vegetation and animal life in the area. Plant enthusiasts will appreciate that this is one of the few places in the world where Coastal Sage Scrub flourishes.

This area served as a lookout point during World Wars I and II when an invasion was feared. During the World Wars cannons mortars and observation bunkers were built here to protect the harbor. The searchlight shelter and power plant used in those tense years still stand along the trail.

Begin your hike near the old lighthouse at the Bayside Trail sign. The paved road soon turns to a gravel and dirt path. When you reach Ballast Point you will turn around and start back. First notice the military defense installations. Nuclear-powered submarines sit below Ballast Point while across the water you can clearly see North Island Naval Air Station. You may be entertained by planes and helicopters taking off and landing.

The hike is easy and suitable for all fitness levels though coming back up the bluff means a 340-foot elevation gain. Benches along the way allow you to rest while the lovely view spreads before you.

Allow 1 to 2 hours for this hike. Dogs are not allowed.

Pro Tip: For World War II buffs be sure to find the concrete bunker at the top on the ocean side of the land. And if you have time include a tour of the inside of the historic lighthouse while you are here.

3. Walk Wide Open Spaces At Santa Ysabel Reserve

The Santa Ysabel Open Space Preserve sprawls on rolling land just outside the mountain town of Julian. Reached by a 45-minute drive from San Diego the Julian area features a miners’ settlement built in the 1800s. Surrounding the small town are acres of oak woodlands native grasslands and in springtime fields of wildflowers.

The Preserve is a nature sanctuary that covers more than 4600 of these lovely acres. Fifteen miles of trails crisscross the land open to hikers cyclists and equestrians. Gentle hills rise around the meadows and a creek runs through the woods. Wildlife you may see includes hawks eagles lizards snakes bobcats and coyotes. Dogs can hike with you but keep them on a leash for their safety.

Enter the Preserve by going east of the town on Farmers Road. The San Diego County Parks and Recreation service provides an excellent map. Plan whether you will take loop trails or head right to the crest where you’ll enjoy a spectacular view.

Note that Julian occasionally experiences snow. If more than a half-inch of rain or snow falls in the area the Preserve is closed until the trails dry out.

4. Challenge Yourself At Iron Mountain

For a moderate hike head to Iron Mountain Trail located near Poway California just off State Route 67. This 5-mile trail looks easy from the parking lot but you will start winding uphill after the beginning. You’ll marvel at the views out to the ocean. And spring flowers abound to cheer you on as you huff and puff upward. The trail offers no shade so plan ahead and take a hat and sunscreen.

Mountain bikers are allowed so watch for them as you hike. You can take your pooch but leashes are required.

Pro Tip: Start early to avoid crowds. This will also allow you to hike up and be back down the mountain before the days heat up in the summer.

5. Climb High At Mission Trails Regional Park

For a hike up a mountain not far from downtown San Diego choose from the options at Mission Trails Regional Park. Located 8 miles from downtown this former home of the Kumeyaay includes five peaks and four of them rise above the San Diego River. The four are Pyles Peak at 1389 feet Kwaay Paay at 1200 feet South Fortuna at 1094 feet and North Fortuna at 1291 feet. To hike these park at the visitor center.

The fifth peak is across Mission Gorge Road and is the highest at 1600 feet. Known as Cowles Mountain this peak is the most well-traveled and will give you a fabulous view out to the ocean. Park at the base along Golfcrest Drive.

Allow about 2 hours to climb up and back down Cowles Mountain. A viewpoint at the top offers a 360-degree view of San Diego — and welcomes you to catch your breath before you start back down.

Check out the San Diego Park System’s map of the five peaks before your hike so you can figure out how far and how steep you want to go.

Pro Tip: Sunrise and sunset atop Cowles Mountain can be breathtaking. Remember your flashlight if you’re on the mountain in the dark.

6. Amble Along Los Penasquitos Canyon Trail

A busy loop trail Los Penasquitos Canyon is 7.3 miles long and is near Poway. The draw is a waterfall. And the trail is fairly flat so hikers of any skill level will enjoy this one. The hike winds through both shady and sunny areas. Take your choice of single-lane trails that shoot off the main path and then rejoin.

If you are short on time or have young ones in your group this is a good place for a nature hike.

7. Tackle The Three Sisters Trail

Are you up for a challenge? The Three Sisters hike is a great choice. This trail rewards your efforts with a variety of ecosystems and three large waterfalls. Once you reach the falls you can swim in the cool water of the pools.

In the past the trail has required scrambling over rocks and going down an eroded hillside. But it recently underwent an upgrade by the U.S. Forest Service. Now you can hike to the falls on a marked trail the entire way. You and the environment are better off. The hike is still demanding though. And if you want to rock climb or crawl over rocky outcrops you can still do that.

The Three Sisters is known as an “inverted” hike. You first go down about 1000 feet into a canyon. After reaching the falls and going for a swim you will still need the energy to climb back up at the end of your hike. Also the canyon can reach high temperatures in the summer so take plenty of water and a hat.

Not only is the terrain hilly but also the trail is sometimes narrow and rocky. And the granite slabs around the waterfalls are slippery because they are wet.

So this hike is for experienced hikers who are in fairly good physical condition. Take snacks wear good hiking shoes and go slowly. The waterfalls pools and hilly landscape can make for a memorable hike as long as you take precautions to stay safe.

If you want to slow things down a bit and go on a leisurely walk instead here is a list of seven fascinating walks in the area. Whether you are looking for a leisurely hike in meadows a hike with ocean and bay views or a hike that allows you to conquer the heights you can find it in San Diego. Check out online maps before you go and take water and snacks. Then head out to refresh your mind and spirit as you explore the wonders of nature.

*GAAP revenue is comprised of services and support and processing revenues (see page 2). Reducing services and support revenue by deconversion revenue for the three months ended March 31 2024 and 2023 which was $843 for the current fiscal year quarter and $6143 for the prior fiscal year quarter results in non-GAAP adjusted services and support revenue growth of 6.4% quarter over quarter. There were no non-GAAP adjustments to processing revenue for the three months ended March 31 2024 and 2023. Reducing services and support revenue by deconversion revenue for the nine months ended March 31 2024 and 2023 which was $9861 for the current fiscal year-to-date period and $17042 for the prior fiscal year-to-date period and by $2 of revenue from acquisition in the current fiscal year-to-date period results in non-GAAP adjusted services and support revenue growth of 7.2% period over period. Reducing processing revenue by revenue from acquisition for the nine months ended March 31 2024 which was $1943 results in non-GAAP adjusted processing revenue growth of 8.5% year-to-date period over year-to-date period. **The VEDIP program expense for the nine months ended March 31 2024 was related to a Company voluntary separation program offered to certain eligible employees beginning in July 2023. ***Non-GAAP adjusted operating margin is calculated by dividing non-GAAP adjusted operating income by non-GAAP adjusted revenue.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information

Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) is the term used to refer to the standard framework of guidelines for financial accounting in the United States. GAAP includes the standards conventions and rules accountants follow in recording and summarizing transactions in the preparation of financial statements. In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with GAAP we have provided certain non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted revenue adjusted operating income adjusted segment income adjusted cost of revenue adjusted operating expenses adjusted operating margin adjusted segment income margin non-GAAP earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization (non-GAAP EBITDA) free cash flow return on invested capital (ROIC) and non-GAAP adjusted net income.

We believe non-GAAP financial measures help investors better understand the underlying fundamentals and true operations of our business. Adjusted revenue adjusted operating income adjusted operating margin adjusted segment income adjusted segment income margin adjusted cost of revenue adjusted operating expenses and adjusted net income eliminate one-time deconversion revenue and associated costs the effects of acquisitions and divestitures the VEDIP program expense and the gain on sale of assets net all of which management believes are not indicative of the Company's operating performance. Such adjustments give investors further insight into our performance. Non-GAAP EBITDA is defined as net income attributable to the Company before the effect of interest expense taxes depreciation and amortization adjusted for net income before the effect of interest expense taxes depreciation and amortization attributable to eliminated one-time deconversions acquisitions and divestitures the VEDIP program expense and the gain on sale of assets net. Free cash flow is defined as net cash from operating activities less capitalized expenditures internal use software and capitalized software plus proceeds from the sale of assets. ROIC is defined as net income divided by average invested capital which is the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and stockholders' equity for a given period. Management believes that non-GAAP EBITDA is an important measure of the Company's overall operating performance and excludes certain costs and other transactions that management deems one time or non-operational in nature; free cash flow is useful to measure the funds generated in a given period that are available for debt service requirements and strategic capital decisions; and ROIC is a measure of the Company's allocation efficiency and effectiveness of its invested capital. For these reasons management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures in its assessment and management of the Company's performance.

Non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and therefore are unlikely to be comparable with calculations of similar measures for other companies.

Any non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in context with the GAAP financial presentation and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to related GAAP measures are included.

At the center of everything we do is a strong commitment to independent research and sharing its profitable discoveries with investors. This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +24.20% per year. These returns cover a period from January 1 1988 through April 1 2024. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can and often do change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available pricing information was not collected or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations. Zacks may license the Zacks Mutual Fund rating provided herein to third parties including but not limited to the issuer.

Jacobs who was elected mayor in 2018 was the 18th entrant in the namesake ""Royal Rumble"" match appearing in full wrestling gear as his Kane character.

Money earned by Jacobs for his appearance will be donated directly to a scholarship fund for the Tennessee College of Applied Technology in Knoxville according to a Knox County news release.

The amount was not disclosed but Jacobs donated $5000 of his salary to start the scholarship earlier this year. The scholarship benefits a Knox County employee's child attending the school.

""Royal Rumble"" is one of the biggest nights for WWE fans each year as the event sets up major storylines heading into ""WrestleMania.""

Sunday's main-event match which involved 30 WWE superstars took place in front of a virtual crowd comprising the acclaimed WWE Thunderdome arena. While Kane was quickly eliminated by being tossed over the top rope the mayor was able to land a signature chokeslam on what was already a big night for Knoxville.

Bianca Blair Crawford who performs in WWE as Bianca Belair won the women's ""Royal Rumble"" match. Crawford was a student at Austin-East Magnet High School and eventually attended The University of Tennessee where she competed as a star track athlete.

Belair's victory comes with a chance to face a women's champion at ""WrestleMania"" the Super Bowl of professional wrestling.

Jacobs was tested for COVID-19 before his trip to Florida which was covered by WWE and upon arriving at the event. He also was tested before returning to work according to the county.

Although Kane's appearance Sunday night was short-lived the Big Red Machine holds the record for most cumulative eliminations in the yearly ""Royal Rumble"" match.

Edge who returned from injury at last year's ""Royal Rumble"" after nine years away from the business won Sunday night's match. While working on his return Edge spent time training at Jacobs' wrestling school which the mayor opened alongside legendary wrestling trainer Tom Prichard in 2019.

Jacobs has made sporadic appearances at WWE events since becoming mayor including at a string of international pay per view events that resulted in a WWE donation to benefit Knox County first responders.

The Kane character also appeared at a live WWE ""Raw"" event in September 2019 at Thompson-Boling Arena.

A private family funeral service and burial will take place at the Cedar Memorial Park Funeral Home and Cemetery. A livestream of the funeral service may be accessed on the funeral home website under the obituary for Jacob under the video tab starting at 11:00am on Wednesday February 3 2021.



Jacob was born on June 20 1992 to Diane Welter and Allen Dvorak in Des Moines. Jacob was always a fighter – even from his first few months of life. Jacob was born with many health issues and spent his first few months in the NICU at Iowa City. Jacob was able to recover and grew up to be a very active and compassionate man. He loved being a part of any team – sports or military. In high school he had the heart of a champion and was named captain of sports teams (affectionally known as JD by his teammates). Jacob also loved to be outdoors whether it was hunting or fishing. When Jacob graduated Nevada High School he immediately pursued his passion and enlisted in the Army.



Jacob enlisted in the Army Reserves on Jan 7 2011. He was a soldier with the 402nd Engineering Company (Sapper) where he served one tour of duty (Dec 2012 – Sept 2013) in Afghanistan with a mission of route clearance. When he returned he joined the USAR Sustainment Command (ASC) – Detachment 12. He then transferred to the 383rd regiment 1st Battalion Training Support. While serving Jacob earned many awards including the Army Commendation Medal Army Good Conduct Medal and National Defense Service Medal NATO Medal and Oversees Training Medal.



From his unit: SGT Dvorak was Devoted. SGT Dvorak was devoted to the Army and his units he was devoted to his friends and devoted to his family. SGT Dvorak would often talk about his high school friends and reminisce about playing football and wrestling and the friends he made playing sports. He would be so proud to bring up his family in conversation his mom Miss Diane and now Darrell we would talk about him being a “mommas boy” (his words) and Father Allen and uncles hunting stories along with his stepmom Sarah and he would beam when he talked about his little brothers and teaching them to wrestle and football and eventually hunting. He talked about his sister with such pride Sarah the family sister who kept them together and he was so excited to be an uncle he would smile from ear to ear. If you knew him he would try and talk but his smile was so big it wouldn’t come out right. The same smile was there when he would talk about Kat and how smart she was. He would say with that same smile “she was going to be a doctor and she owes me because she took my portion of the brains at birth!”. He was so proud and happy to talk about his family. He was proud of his Fiancé who he would talk about helping her go back to school and he took immense pleasure and pride when he would tell me “I need to pick up my kids” or I am taking “Latasha out for date night”! He was so proud in all of these conversations but what I noticed that his pride was always in the people of his life not in what he did. He may have boasted about being the small guy in football or wrestling but nothing made him smile more than when he talked about family friends or the military.



Left to cherish Jacob’s memories are his fiancé Latasha and her children Jaxson Jermarrion Jermane and Lillian; parents Diane & Darrell and Allen & Sarah; sisters Sarah and Katherine; brothers Caleb and Josef; niece and nephew Mary Ellen and Henry; grandparents Alice and Lee & Cindy; aunts and uncles Terry & Dawn Randy & Sheri and Jennifer & Paul; and cousins Megan Amiee Erika and Kaitlyn.

Not to mention extra burdens.

Joe shrugs those off though and continues to work.

He was the only returning starter for the Grizzlies and the only player left with significant minutes from their 6A title run two years ago.

""There's not as many players that have had varsity experience"" Joe said. ""I'm just about the only one that's quality minutes over the last couple of years.

""It's definitely tough and more of a responsibility and more to carry on my shoulders but it's all part of what we've got to do to win.""

Entering Friday's game Joe was averaging 11.8 points and had a run of five straight games in double figures before being held to six points in a loss to Cabot on Tuesday.

Joe scored just three points Friday but it didn't affect Northside as the Grizzlies dispatched Little Rock Southwest 57-47.

Though he has turned in some quality scoring games hitting double figures in 11 of Northside's 16 games thus far Joe admits not having quite the scoring output he and others expected him to have.

""I've been working on my attack game more because that's where I've been struggling a lot this year"" Joe said. ""My shot's been falling but I still need to get more shots up over the course of the games and we've got to come out with some big wins; we've been losing games at the end that we've been up the whole time.

""(Others') expectations are high but mine are even higher and I've just got to come out and do better for the rest of the season.""

Those expectations also come with being the younger brother of one of the greatest Northside basketball players.

Joe's older brother Isaiah went on to a stellar career at Arkansas and is a rookie with the NBA's Philadelphia 76ers.

""He's just been telling me to block it all out and just stay focused and that my time is coming"" Jacob Joe said.

It happened on Jan. 19 during a home win against Cabot. Joe scored a season-high 27 points and hit six 3-pointers.

""My teammates were just finding me in the open spots and I was just able to knock them down"" he said.

The Grizzlies (8-8 4-4 6A-Central) enter a pivotal week at home. Tuesday they take on top 10 ranked Bryant and then welcome 6A No. 1 ranked Little Rock Central next Friday.

""We've got to just keep going hard in practice every day and keep working on the things that we know we're going to have to do better to beat those teams"" Joe said. ""Then we're going to have to get better at finishing games.

""I've really got to continue to get stronger and get more rebounds and do other things on the floor other than score to help my team win.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vdWdhd2lyZS51c2F0b2RheS5jb20vMjAyMS8wMS8zMS9mb3JtZXItdWdhLXdyLW1lY29sZS1oYXJkbWFuLWNvbHRzLXNob3VsZC1wYXNzLXRvcmNoLXRvLWphY29iLWVhc29uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mecole Hardman: Colts should pass torch to Jacob Eason,"The Colts are in search of who will replace quarterback Phillip Rivers in Indianapolis next season.

The obvious answer seemed to be Georgia Bulldog great Matt Stafford but that ship has since sailed after the former No. 1 overall pick was dealt to Los Angeles in exchange for Jared Goff and some draft picks on Saturday.

The Colts now face three options: Promote from within look to free agency or a potential trade or use an early draft pick on someone who can become the future of the franchise.

But let’s not forget that Indianapolis spent a mid-round pick on former Georgia and Washington quarterback Jacob Eason last year taking the 6-foot-6 signal caller with the 122nd overall pick in the fourth round of the 2020 NFL Draft.

Could he be an option next year for the Colts? Former Georgia wide receiver Mecole Hardman who played two seasons with Eason in Athens likes the first option – promote from within.

On Friday Hardman tweeted that the Colts should look to Eason to be their guy under center next season.

Colts got @skinnyqb10 !!! He should be next man up !!! — Mecole Hardman Jr. (@MecoleHardman4) January 29 2021

After transferring from Georgia at the end of the 2017 season Eason sat out a year due to NCAA rules and then started the 2019 season at quarterback for the Washington Huskies.

At Washington in 2019 Eason led the Huskies to an 8-5 record throwing for 3132 yards with 23 touchdowns and 8 interceptions. Eason was projected as one of the top 5 quarterbacks in last year’s draft but along with former teammate Jake Fromm was forced to wait a bit longer to hear his name called and was eventually taken in the fourth round."

Marjorie Taylor Greene met for a second day at the Capitol on Tuesday political adversaries trying to engineer an off-ramp from the escalating standoff over her threat for a vote to oust him from office.

The stakes are high for both.

Republican Johnson is hoping to avoid a politically fraught outcome in which he would keep his job but only after relying on Democrats who have pledged their support to save him at least this time.

Greene a top ally of Donald Trump faces her own potentially embarrassing setback if her motion to vacate the speaker fizzles as is expected.

“Right now the ball is in Mike Johnson’s court” said Greene R-Ga. “I am so done with words. For me it’s all about actions.”

In a brazen move Greene has forced her way to the negotiating table and outlined four demands — including no more funding for Ukraine as it fights Russia and an end to the Justice Department special counsel’s legal cases against the indicted former president Trump.

Throughout Johnson has tried to portray himself six months on the job since the ouster of then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy as in control of the situation and not beholden to the hard-right forces that have created chaos throughout this session of Congress.

“Look they’ve been very productive discussions. that’s what I’ll say” Johnson R-La. said after Tuesday’s 90-minute meeting.

Johnson downplayed the idea that there was any deal to be made saying the meetings are simply part of his open-door policy to hear out the ideas of fellow Republican lawmakers as is his practice as the new leader.

“It’s not a negotiation” Johnson said.

But it’s clear whether or not Greene proceeds with her plan to call the vote this week — or lets the moment slip away — the threat of removal will trail the speaker’s tenure and force him to consider concessions to the far-right forces to keep members satisfied.

Greene said she had “high expectations” the speaker would deliver.

“This is what people all over the country are screaming for” Greene said Tuesday on Steve Bannon’s “War Room” podcast. “They want to see this vote.”

Another hardline congressman Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky has joined in the meetings and warned Johnson not to draw out a decision.

“If his plan is to drag this out so the pressure comes off of this and to drag it out for weeks or days even without making some movement in our direction then he would just be far better off to have this vote and get it behind him” Massie said.

The effort to oust Johnson has been panned by Trump who gave his nod of support to the speaker and it has failed to gain traction among Republicans leaving Greene almost alone with just a few colleagues on her side.

But the demands Greene is making are mostly popular among Republicans and could be difficult for Johnson to ignore. That gives both her and the speaker incentive to embrace a deal — particularly since Trump would almost certainly be supportive.

In a signal of what’s to come Johnson lashed out at the Justice Department’s two cases from special prosecutor Jack Smith against Trump — over mishandling classified documents as well as the effort to overturn the 2020 election in the runup to the Jan. 6 2021 Capitol attack.

Johnson echoing Greene’s claims of sham trials called the Justice Department cases against Trump “election interference” that “has to stop” as the former president is the party’s presumptive nominee in the 2024 race for the White House.

“President Trump has done nothing wrong here” said Johnson who led one of the defeated president’s legal efforts trying to overturn Biden’s 2020 election victory before the bloody Capitol siege.

Johnson said the House will consider the flow of federal funds to the Justice Department and oversight of the special prosecutor’s office. “Stay tuned” he said.

Greene is also demanding that Johnson abide by the Hastert rule named for another former Republican speaker that requires leaders to proceed with voting on bills only when they have support from the majority of their members.

Relying on the Hastert rule could have tanked congressional support for Ukraine since the recently approved $61 million foreign aid package did not have backing from most Republicans. It passed with Democratic support.

Greene also wants to insist on federal spending reductions championed by Massie which would require a 1% across-the-board cut if Congress fails to pass the regular appropriation bills by the Sept. 30 deadline for the end of the fiscal year. A similar deal was struck last year lending support to the idea.

Other Republicans even if they agree with some of the ideas being proposed are wary of Johnson making any deals with a select few.

“I don’t have a problem with him listening but what I will have a problem with and we had this problem with Speaker McCarthy is when you start making special special deals and hidden deals “said Rep. Kevin Hern R-Okla. “And then people not just conservatives but moderates and everybody else says where’s my deal?”

But ultra-conservative Rep. Tim Burchett R-Tenn. said Greene backing off the motion to vacate for now would be a “a wise move.” He said it signals “she’s going to play her best hand and that’s to get what you can get.”

The speaker is working to show he is in control of the House and not being led by Democrats who are in the minority but have outsized influence because they have provided the votes for much of the consequential issues this Congress.

Rep. Hakeem Jeffries the Democratic leader has emerged as an empowered speaker-in-waiting if Democrats win party control in November. He and his leadership team have promised to vote to table Greene’s motion essentially saving Johnson’s job.

But Johnson insisted Tuesday he has no interest in relinquishing the gavel any time soon. Even though some Republicans have said he should step aside Johnson said he intends to continue leading the House Republicans well into next year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vUG9saXRpY3Mvam9obnNvbi1ncmVlbmUtbWVldC1ncmVlbmUtdm93cy1mb3JjZS12b3RlLXdlZWsvc3Rvcnk_aWQ9MTA5OTU4MzQ40gFmaHR0cHM6Ly9hYmNuZXdzLmdvLmNvbS9hbXAvUG9saXRpY3Mvam9obnNvbi1ncmVlbmUtbWVldC1ncmVlbmUtdm93cy1mb3JjZS12b3RlLXdlZWsvc3Rvcnk_aWQ9MTA5OTU4MzQ4?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Marjorie Taylor Greene says she'll meet with Speaker Mike Johnson again Tuesday amid threat to oust him,"Johnson said he had ""a lengthy constructive meeting"" with Greene and Massie.

Marjorie Taylor Greene says she'll meet with Speaker Mike Johnson again Tuesday amid threat to oust him

House Speaker Mike Johnson and Republican Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Thomas Massie met privately on Monday amid Greene's looming threat to try to oust him.

Emerging from a nearly two-hour meeting inside the speaker's office Greene said on camera they will have another meeting with Johnson on Tuesday afternoon.

""I just want to thank you all for waiting -- we just had a very long discussion with the speaker. We are going to be meeting again tomorrow based on the discussion that we've had. And so we really don't have any news to report at this time"" Greene said Monday.

When pressed by ABC's Rachel Scott if Greene still plans to move forward with a motion to vacate the congresswoman said: ""Again we had a very long discussion with Speaker Johnson. We will be meeting with him again tomorrow based on the discussion that we had and then I'll have more information for you.""

Asked again if she plans to force a vote on a motion to vacate Greene said: ""I have been patient. I have been diligent. I have been steady. And I have been focused on the facts. And none of that has changed.""

Greene said the meeting Monday afternoon was about ""ways to move forward for a Republican-controlled House of Representatives.""

Johnson said he had ""a lengthy constructive meeting"" with Greene and Massie Monday afternoon.

""We have discussed some ideas and we are going to meet again tomorrow"" Johnson said.

Johnson said he told Greene and Massie he understands their frustration saying ""I would really like to advance much more of our conservative policy on a daily basis here. But the reality is we are working with the smallest majority in U.S. history with a one-vote margin.""

""We are going to keep this team together and work for the American people"" Johnson added.

The meeting comes as Greene has said she will force a vote to remove Johnson from the leadership post this week.

The timing of when Greene plans to trigger the motion to vacate however remains unclear. The House held votes later Monday evening and Greene did not act on the motion to vacate.

The Georgia congresswoman said last week she was moving ahead with her ouster effort despite pushback from many Republicans and a statement from Democrats that they would step in to help save Johnson.

""Mike Johnson is not capable of that job"" Greene said in a fiery press conference outside the U.S. Capitol on May 1 alongside her co-sponsor Massie of Kentucky. ""He has proven that over and over again.""

Greene and Massie continued their criticisms of Johnson publicly on social media on Monday.

""This week we vote on whether Mike Johnson should remain as Speaker"" Massie said in a statement on X. ""If you're happy with what he's done this year and if you're looking forward to what he will do the remainder of the year you should join the Democrat leader Hakeem Jeffries in supporting Mike Johnson.""

Greene has dangled the motion to vacate the speaker's chair for more than a month. Johnson's defended himself from her criticism -- namely that he's worked with Democrats to keep the government open provide foreign aid and more -- by emphasizing that he's a lifelong Republican but must do his job to serve the entire House with an extremely thin Republican majority.

""This motion is wrong for the Republican Conference wrong for the institution and wrong for the country"" Johnson said last week of the ouster threat.

Johnson also received a boost over the weekend from former President Donald Trump who brought Johnson on stage at the Republican Nation Committee's spring retreat luncheon at Mar-a-Lago.

Trump praised Johnson ""for his leadership and work in the US House"" emphasizing ""the need for party unity collaboration and expanding the GOP's House Majority"" according to Trump's campaign.

Last week Greene denied she was defying Trump in pushing ahead against Johnson.

""I'm the biggest supporter of President Trump and that's why I fight every single day. And that's why I'm fighting here against my own Republican conference to fight harder against the Democrats"" she told ABC News Correspondent Elizabeth Schulze.

A return to the “Hastert Rule ” meaning no legislation is brought to a vote without support from a majority of the House majority;

” meaning no legislation is brought to a vote without support from a majority of the House majority; Defunding the special counsel probes into former President Donald Trump in upcoming appropriations; and

into former President Donald Trump in upcoming appropriations; and Enforcement of the “Massie Rule” whereby government funding is automatically cut across the board if no superseding agreement is reached before a set deadline.

They’ll meet again today at 12:30 p.m. in hopes of finding a detente. Spokespeople for Greene and Johnson declined to comment on their discussions but the speaker struck a conciliatory note after yesterday’s meeting sympathizing with Greene and pledging to “keep this team together.”

Make no mistake though the pressure for Republican party unity in an election year is weighing on Greene who is battling exasperated GOP colleagues and skepticism from the party’s unquestioned leader Trump.

Johnson could be in a position to grant at least some of Greene’s asks. Since this Congress has effectively finished passing controversial must-do items such as funding the government raising the debt ceiling and extending surveillance authorities Johnson can probably stick to the Hastert Rule (named for former now-disgraced speaker Dennis Hastert).

Democrats agreed to a version of the Massie Rule during last year’s spending talks with then-speaker Kevin McCarthy — so Johnson could probably go there as well.

On Ukraine Congress just sent Kyiv $60 billion in aid — enough to last through the year by most estimates though Greene might also want to strike an expected nine-figure aid authorization in the annual Pentagon policy bill that’s expected to move later this year.

But defunding special counsel Jack Smith’s Trump investigations could be much trickier. Front-line Republicans in the past have balked at such demands to say nothing of Democrats. If Greene is expecting Johnson to put up a fight on a much-anticipated September continuing resolution that would be a recipe for a federal shutdown just weeks before the election.

The two sides don’t have a deal yet — and might never get one — but it’s clear temperatures are dropping. A handshake solution after all is in the interest of both parties: It would spare Johnson a risky vote where he’d be relying on the generosity of Democrats to save his gavel.

And for Greene her relationship with Trump and his inner circle is on the line we’re told. The former president “could not have been clearer” one person close to him said last night in signaling that he isn’t interested in any more intraparty drama this election season.

Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene R-Ga. and Thomas Massie R-Ky. met with Johnson behind closed doors for roughly two hours late Monday afternoon after promising last week to force a House-wide vote on his removal. They declined to give details to reporters immediately after the sit-down but said they would have a follow-up discussion with Johnson on Tuesday.

However Fox News Digital was told they are broadly seeking four points – including no more funding for Ukraine nor special counsel Jack Smith's investigation into former President Trump.

They are also demanding that Johnson vow to block any legislation from getting a House-wide vote unless it has the support of a majority of the House GOP – a longstanding informal provision called the Hastert rule named after a former Republican speaker.

MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE FILES MOTION TO OUST SPEAKER JOHNSON

On government funding the conservatives are also pushing Johnson to adhere to the Massie rule which would require automatic federal spending cuts if an agreement is not reached on fiscal year 2025 funding by the Sept. 30 deadline.

Fox News Digital reached out to Greene Massie and Johnson's offices for comment. A spokesman for Greene declined to discuss the contents of a private meeting.

Meanwhile Rep. Paul Gosar R-Ariz. the third GOP rebel who signed onto Greene's motion to vacate the chair – a resolution calling for a House-wide vote on removing the speaker – suggested to reporters on Monday evening that he wanted Johnson to have some more time to change course.

HOUSE DEMS SAY THEY’LL BLOCK MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE FROM OUSTING SPEAKER JOHNSON

""I don't think it's going to happen this week. I hope it doesn't happen this week"" Gosar told reporters. ""I think it would be nice to see him go back to regular order get things coming from committees you get a majority of the majority to get something on the floor.""

Greene is leading the push to oust Johnson amid conservative frustrations over his bipartisan work on critical legislation related to government funding and foreign aid. She and Massie pledged to force the vote sometime this week.

To do so she would have to notice her resolution as ""privileged"" – meaning the House would have two legislative days to vote on the measure itself or first vote on scuttling it via a procedure known as ""tabling"" the resolution.

Boris Johnson was urged by the region’s First Minister Arlene Foster on Saturday to replace the Northern Ireland Protocol after Brussels invoked a clause to prevent shipments of jabs entering the UK in an “incredible act of hostility”.

The EU backtracked on the move after condemnation from London Dublin and Belfast with leaders all blindsided by the decision to trigger Article 16 of the protocol as the European bloc is embroiled in a row with pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca over shortfalls in the delivery of jabs.

Despite criticism from the World Health Organisation the EU is pushing ahead with imposing controls on vaccines manufactured within member states which could hinder the UK’s access to further supplies particularly to the Belgian-made Pfizer jab.

The U-turn on Northern Ireland late on Friday night came after the Prime Minister expressed his “grave concern” to European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen who also faced pressure from Irish premier Micheal Martin.

The EU chief said she had agreed a “satisfactory way to introduce an export authorisation mechanism” for vaccines with Mr Martin who was said to be furious about the initial move.

But attempts to soothe tensions did little to stem the flow of criticism with Julian Smith a Conservative MP and former Northern Ireland secretary saying the “EU cocked up big time” in risking a hard border returning to the island of Ireland.

“And they did that in my view without anywhere near the understanding of the Good Friday Agreement of the sensitivity of the situation in Northern Ireland and it was an almost Trumpian act” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.

DUP leader Ms Foster said the move was “absolutely disgraceful” and reiterated calls for the Prime Minister to invoke Article 16 of the Northern Ireland Protocol over food shortages being faced in her nation because of Brexit.

(PA Graphics)

“The protocol is unworkable let’s be very clear about that and we need to see it replaced because otherwise there is going to be real difficulties here in Northern Ireland” she said.

Pressed whether that would be in breach of an international treaty she told Today: “Well it didn’t seem to bother the European Union yesterday when they breached the treaty in terms of their embarrassment around their vaccine procurement.”

Spanish foreign minister Arancha Gonzalez-Laya told BBC Newsnight the EU’s triggering of the article was “an accident”.

But the bloc continued to warn of further action saying: “Should transits of vaccines and active substances toward third countries be abused to circumvent the effects of the authorisation system the EU will consider using all the instruments at its disposal.”

Irish foreign affairs minister Simon Coveney said “lessons should be learned” and warned the protocol “is not something to be tampered with lightly it’s an essential hard-won compromise protecting peace and trade for many”.

The EU had sought to justify the measure as being needed to prevent Northern Ireland being used as a back door to move coronavirus vaccines from the bloc into the UK “due to a lack of supply threatening to disturb the orderly implementation of the vaccination campaigns in the member states”.

Regardless of the U-turn French President Emmanuel Macron backed the EU seeking to “control” vaccine exports as he raised questions about a lack of doses being delivered by Anglo-Swedish firm AstraZeneca.

“It should be controlled because there is questionable behaviour and we will be receiving fewer deliveries that do not honour the contractual engagements agreed” he said in an interview with media including the Guardian.

Brussels has also demanded doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine manufactured in British plants to solve its supply shortage issues as member states have been forced to pause or delay their rollouts.",,,,,,

Scharf was hired in 2019 after a long search for a permanent CEO following a series of scandals including charging customers for auto insurance they didn't need and the so-called fake account scandal that resulted in a $3 billion criminal penalty. In 2018 the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency penalized the bank a $1 billion fine for misconduct in its auto- and mortgage-lending business.

Scharf was also brought in to resolve issues including the bank's regulatory growth restrictions in which the Federal Reserve imposed a cap on the bank's growth.

Scharf previously served as a top lieutenant to JPMorgan Chase and co-CEO Jamie Dimon during the 2008 financial crisis.

In January 1987 we ran our first Vermont 100 predicated on 1986 revenues. Since then there have been only four companies that have been Number One: National Life Group C&S Wholesale Grocers Fletcher Allen Health Care (now The University of Vermont Medical Center) and Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc (now Keurig Dr Pepper and based in Plano TX).

Keurig had pulled away from the field with over $4 billion in revenues but in 2016 it was bought by a European firm that is gobbling up coffee and sandwich chains from coast to coast; Keurig is no longer part of the Vermont 100. It joins the likes of Ben & Jerry’s and Seventh Generation Bond Auto and IDX Systems many of the ski resorts and fuel companies Biotek and GW Plastics and several others who also have been sold to outside firms.

This year brought a new change whose long-term implications might not be known for a long time. We’re talking about of course the COVID-19 pandemic.

Some companies are choosing to sit out the Vermont 100 after what has been a rough year for most but not all Vermont businesses.

Leading the way for those still on the list is our first and current top firm National Life which is not only the largest Vermont-based firm but also consistently boasts strong growth. Congratulations to them.

Here are a few newer firms to keep your eye on for their growth and innovation: Mamava (Burlington); Marathon Health (Colchester); OnLogic (South Burlington) and Caledonia Spirits (Montpelier).

For all the companies the median sales were $38 million (121 companies). Two years ago the median was $29.2 million (169 companies).

But we can also see tremendous growth as we look back now 35 years. Some of Vermont’s stalwart companies from across the state continue to lead the way in both growth and innovation.

The 35-year growth chart reads like a Who’s Who of historically great Vermont companies from Orvis to Mack Molding to Engelberth Construction to Carris Reels.

We at Vermont Business Magazine are grateful to all the companies on this year’s list the vast majority of whom participate voluntarily every year.

Notices pinned to bulletin boards throughout the plant in the days prior alerted workers to that much.

That day a Dixie executive from Atlanta was in town. She met with the workers’ union leaders at 7:15 a.m. — 15 minutes after the plant’s third shift ends and its first shift begins — and delivered the news. Then at 7:30 a.m. she spoke to more than 150 employees sitting in chairs separated by 6 feet — a reminder of the pandemic that had chilled demand for the facility’s products. Those who couldn’t attend were notified with a phone call after.

Just after 9 a.m. corporate parent Georgia-Pacific released the news publicly: It was closing its longtime Dixie cup manufacturing plant in Forks Township by the end of 2021 putting 190 people out of work and relocating some of the operation’s equipment to an existing site in Kentucky.

“I was taken by surprise” said Dennis Andrews a printing operator who has worked at the plant for 23 years and four months. “In hindsight you could say there were signs but everybody’s good with hindsight. For me this came out of left field.”

Andrews as financial secretary of United Steelworkers Local 412 heard the news at 7:15 a.m. and then again with the rest of the plant 15 minutes later when he stood in the back while the executive spoke through a microphone. He couldn’t tell you much of what she said at the larger meeting — his hearing isn’t all that good after years running the printing press that stamps designs on the Dixie cups.

What’s clear is the closure will be gradual and effects bargaining between Georgia-Pacific and the union will begin Feb. 8 Andrews said.

Georgia-Pacific will close its Lehigh Valley manufacturing plant in Forks Township by the end of the year the company announced Jan. 15. The plant which sits off Kesslersville Road makes cups under the Dixie name.

The first cuts will come between March 25 and April 7 when 16 hourly employees and one salaried worker will lose their jobs according to a Jan. 21 notice filed with the state to comply with the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act.

Fifty-seven more — 51 hourly six salaried — will be let go between July 21 and Aug. 3. The final 116 workers which includes 104 hourly and 12 salaried employees needed to close the plant and decommission the facility’s assets will lose their jobs sometime between Dec. 15 and Dec. 28.

Wind-downs like this have happened in the Lehigh Valley and beyond before of course ? the decision made by a corporate parent based elsewhere that sees declining demand and opts to consolidate operations to reduce costs and keep pace with rivals. Those plants often were longtime employment hubs places where generations of the same family spent their careers. That was the case at the Forks plant which dates to 1964 and is just one part of Dixie’s long history in the Lehigh Valley.

The pandemic by minimizing public gatherings halting events and forcing many office employees to work from home cut into sales for paper cups and opened the door for Georgia-Pacific to relocate operations under one roof as it attempts to bolster its competitive stance in the industry.

“We’ve seen a decrease in consumption as we’ve all transitioned to how we’re living in the last few months” Georgia-Pacific spokesperson Tom Strother explained. “At the end of the day decisions like this are difficult to make. This was a strategic decision we made based upon the needs of our business and our ability to be competitive long term.”

Or as Andrews said as he tried to make sense of it all: “This is just the numbers. This is all just numbers.”

But in the Lehigh Valley overflowing with industrial activity economic development leaders expressed confidence the Dixie property will be in high demand when it closes. And with many employers in the sector struggling to find talent the hope is many Dixie workers will land on their feet once they are let go.

Way back when

When state Sen. Lisa Boscola heard Georgia-Pacific was closing its Forks manufacturing plant her mind flashed back to a 1999 tour of the facility when it was part of the Fort James Corp.

She remembers that Friday afternoon in August as an exciting day when Fort James touted a $14 million 48-job expansion at its Dixie plant as the company rushed to meet demand for a then-revolutionary product: a disposable cup made of plastic-coated paper that kept coffee hot without scorching the consumer’s hands. McDonald’s was among the big buyers of the cup called the PerfecTouch. The company sent Boscola home with some of its cups that day.

“My husband and I thought they were pretty cool” said Boscola whose district no longer includes the Forks facility. “I remember having those cups in my house and thinking ‘This is so great to have in the Lehigh Valley.'”

The state chipped in $275000 in grants to support that expansion with Fort James planning to use almost half of the 350000-square-foot Forks plant to produce PerfecTouch cups. At the same time the company also invested $14 million to equip its Darlington South Carolina plant to make the cups.

Less than one year later Georgia-Pacific Corp. then better known for its forest and building products announced it was acquiring Fort James for $7.8 billion in cash and stock plus the assumption of $3.5 billion in debt. The deal closed Nov. 27 2000 a major step in the Atlanta company’s push to transform itself into the holder of more consumer name brands such as Quilted Northern Brawny and Dixie.

Analysts at the time predicted few changes for the 450 employees making Dixie cups paper plates and disposable forks knives and spoons at the Forks plant. But the acquisition of Fort James also loaded Georgia-Pacific up with more debt and the company spent the next few years reducing its debt from a peak of $16 billion to $8.7 billion by the end of 2004.

By November 2005 Georgia-Pacific had a deal in place to go private: Koch Industries Inc. was buying the company for $13.2 billion plus the assumption of $7.8 billion in Georgia-Pacific debt.

At that time the Forks plant employed 386 people Morning Call archives show.

Koch Industries based in Wichita Kansas and one of the largest private companies in the United States still owns Georgia-Pacific today.

Under Koch Andrews said the Forks operation’s employment slowly slimmed down over the years. That continued a trend at the site considering the plant once employed 525 and was Northampton County’s 13th-largest employer in 1996 before the 1997 merger of James River Corp. and Fort Howard Corp.

Thinking about the plant now reminds Andrews of the conversations he had when he started there in the late 1990s. The old-timers as he called them would tell him: “Dennis this isn’t like it was.”

Andrews whose previous job was nonunion didn’t think it was so bad.

But now with the plant getting ready to close?

“I find myself as one of the old-timers saying the exact same thing” he said.

What happened?

Andrews usually would take overtime at the plant when it was available. But when the coronavirus pandemic hit in March overtime dried up in the printing department. In fact production at the plant shut down for a few weeks last year as demand slowed for the Dixie to Go/PerfecTouch cup and the snap-on lids.

“As a private company we don’t publish specific production information” said Strother the company spokesperson. “However there has been a decrease in volume some of which is attributable to the global pandemic.”

Industry analysts said paper cup volume has been hit hard especially with many office employees still working from home and no longer picking up their daily cup of joe-to-go. Also Dixie’s PerfecTouch cup is often used in car dealerships repair shops doctor’s offices and other spots where coffee is available to people waiting or working said Charles Gross a senior equity analyst with Morningstar who covers the paper packaging industry including many of Georgia-Pacific’s big competitors.

“Unfortunately closures throughout the U.S. have sharply dried up foot traffic at those ‘water coolers'” said Gross who covers International Paper WestRock and Packaging Corp. of America.

Though the paper packaging business as a whole is steadily growing Gross noted there will be winners and losers in the industry. He also has concerns about long-term demand for disposable products that can be hard to recycle such as the PerfecTouch cup as consumers increasingly focus on sustainable items.

While it’s true that demand is down longtime packaging and forest products analyst Mark Wilde thinks there is more to Georgia-Pacific’s decision to close its Forks plant. Wilde covered Georgia-Pacific when it was a public company and now analyzes Pactiv Evergreen and Graphic Packaging International which also produce paper cups.

“I would be a bit surprised if this short-term issue was the only factor behind the Georgia-Pacific decision” said Wilde of BMO Capital Markets Equity Research. “I think they are always looking at their manufacturing footprint for ways to reduce cost.”

While market conditions matter Strother said Georgia-Pacific also believes having all Dixie cup manufacturing under one roof in Lexington Kentucky will allow it to stay competitive. Once the Forks plant closes all Dixie cups including premium hot cups recycled fiber cups and bath cups will be made at the 550000-square-foot Lexington facility that employs 230 people.

Gross said Georgia-Pacific’s peers also have consolidated facilities over the last decade.

“Ultimately most of these products can be considered ‘commodities’ and it’s a constant race to lower your costs faster than the competition” he said. “Consolidating locations can reduce overhead costs like property taxes or operating lease costs and typically allows some reduction in headcount — one fewer person managing the front desk and fewer accountants and managers per unit of production.”

With work moving to Lexington Georgia-Pacific is planning to add about 50 jobs at that plant. Mike Watson president of Teamsters Local 651 which represents the Lexington workers said the union has started conversations to see if any existing Forks employees want to transfer.

While the company said 230 people work at the Lexington plant Watson said that’s likely including nonunion employees since the Teamsters no longer has that many members at the facility following some cutbacks in the last couple years.

“This announcement that they were closing Lehigh … quite frankly I thought it was going to go the opposite way” Watson said. “We are happy here to a degree because we’re going to get 50 more jobs is what they’re telling me.”

It surprised Andrews too.

He said Georgia-Pacific rolled out a new computer system at the Forks plant in October a technological upgrade that helped the facility better track product and do inventory. He took that as a sign that the company was reinvesting.

Strother said Georgia-Pacific is implementing new business systems at all of its consumer products manufacturing sites which included the Lehigh Valley plant late last year.

Then after all of those months with no extra work available Andrews said he got a weekend of overtime in January.

“I thought things were turning around” he said.

What now?

To Don Cunningham the situation at the Forks facility feels familiar in a way.

He likened it to what unfolded more than five years ago when the Lehigh Valley learned that the longtime Kraft plant would close in Upper Macungie Township costing 415 people their jobs as part of a larger corporate downsizing.

After the Kraft plant closed in November 2016 the property was sold just months later to an Atlanta developer that demolished the plant and built two industrial buildings now a 1.5 million-square-foot manufacturing warehouse and distribution operation for Keurig Dr Pepper.

Cunningham president and CEO of the Lehigh Valley Economic Development Corp. said two manufacturing companies looking to enter the Lehigh Valley market have already expressed interest in Georgia-Pacific’s plant in Forks. In addition he said several area employers hungry for talent are eager to hire any displaced Dixie workers.

“There’s a lot of interest already” Cunningham said. “I just hope the timing lines up.”

For Georgia-Pacific which owns the nearly 36-acre property at 605 Kuebler Road Strother said the company will decide what’s next for the property toward the end of 2021 after cup-making operations have ended.

As for the affected workers like Andrews time will tell what’s next.

Andrews found out recently that his job as a printing operator is going to last until December so he’ll be among the last group of employees to exit the building where he started as a general laborer 23 years and four months ago.

Born and raised in Easton Andrews bought a house in Wilson a year ago and just turned 60 years old. The thought of not having a job is scary he admitted and he’s got another five years or so of work left in his career.

Whatever comes next he said: “It will be union work I guarantee you.”

Now one of the plant’s old-timers he’ll remember the people he worked alongside at the Dixie plant. He’ll remember how they helped one another. He’ll remember how multiple generations of the same family worked at the plant over the years. His aunt and uncle in fact retired from the facility.

“Everyone was there to do a job and it got done and everyone was happy” he said.

But now in 2021 each of the plant’s 190 employees will eventually do their job in Forks one final time. Their last task will occur in March April July August or December and then they’ll leave behind the facility with a giant Dixie cup planted out front.

Nearly 500 trees were removed many of them over 60 years old. With their removal goes some of the last vestiges of the citrus industry which once dominated Fullerton’s landscape. The developer has indicated that they will plant over 600 new trees.

“It’s distressing to see the disappearance of the last commercial orange grove in Fullerton which was also home to a mature avocado grove with an exceedingly rare rootstock feature other rare trees and many forms of pollinators and wildlife that had adapted to the orchard including resident and migratory birds that are just about to start their nesting season” said Jane Reifer of Friends for a Livable Fullerton (FFLF) who had worked to preserve some of the groves. “This was sadly one of the few open spaces left in a congested urban and park-disadvantaged District 5.”

Fullerton City Council voted unanimously on Nov. 2 to allow development of the property including removal of the trees.

At that public hearing representatives of FFLF asked to save a portion of the groves. Though an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) was done by the developer as required by State law FFLF asked for a survey of the over 500 trees on the property and for a biological assessment covering birds mammals and pollinators. Such an additional survey was not done.

Former Mayor Pro Tem Jan Flory suggested a compromise regarding saving trees that did not impact the warehouse footprints and offering avocado tree scions to the public but there was no follow-up/implementation despite requests.

When asked for comment City Manager Ken Domer said “The private property owners are moving forwards with their project and obtained a demolition permit to begin clearing the buildings. I am not sure if tree removal requires a permit. As to their discussions with other concerned parties or even those who had CEQA (California Environmental Quality Act) challenges against them I am unaware of their actions or progress.”

City Councilmembers did not reply to e-mails sent by the Observer asking for comment.

One of the Conditions of Approval for the project was to avoid removal of trees “to the greatest extent possible during the nesting season (generally February 1 through August 31).”

If the trees had been removed on Monday February 1 a preconstruction nesting bird survey would have to have been conducted on Friday January 29 to see if active nests of species protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the California Fish and Game Code were present in order to prevent disturbances to nesting and baby birds. It is possibly a coincidence but the timing of this seems calculated to avoid being technically subject to this condition.

Reifer said she feels that the process for allowing public input on saving the groves was inadequate. At an October 14 2020 Planning Commission meeting the developer had 40 minutes to speak. Because of COVID-19 the public was not allowed to comment in person and their e-mails explaining the “hidden” biological resources although promised in the agenda to be read were not.

Reifer pointed out many other shortcomings with the process and the development plan as it was submitted and approved.

“The Council should consider an initiative to clean up the process by which large projects are approved and Planning Commissioners and Councilmembers should report when they’ve had conversations and site tours with development applicants” Reifer said.

At the February 3 Planning Commission meeting Goodman Logistics is requesting to modify the Site Plan with what they feel is a minor modification but the Director of Community and Economic Development has determined that they are not minor.

ELSA is an app that helps by using speech recognition technology to correct pronunciation. Based in San Francisco and Ho Chi Minh City ELSA announced today it has raised a $15 million Series B led by VI (Vietnam Investments) Group and SIG. Other participants included returning investors Google’s AI-focused fund Gradient Ventures SOSV and Monk’s Hill Ventures along with Endeavor Catalyst Globant Ventures and U2’s The Edge (David Evans).

The capital will be used to expand ELSA’s operations in Latin America and build a scalable B2B platform allowing companies and educational organizations to offers the app’s coaching services to employees or students. Founded in 2015 ELSA which stands for English Language Speech Assistant now claims more than 13 million users. Its last round of funding was a $7 million Series A announced in 2019.

In addition to Latin America ELSA will also focus on expanding in Vietnam India and Japan where it saw high demand last year. The company recently formed a partnership with IDP one of the owners of the widely-used IELTS English language test which now recommends ELSA to for test preparation. ELSA is also working with language schools in Vietnam like IMAP and Speak Up online learning platform YOLA and corporate clients including Kimberly Clark Intel and ATAD.

ELSA co-founder and chief executive officer Vu Van told TechCrunch that many users want to improve their English speaking proficiency for job opportunities and to increase their earning potential. In Vietnam India and Brazil people with higher English speaking proficiency can earn about two to three times more than their colleagues she said.

“This motivation drives a lot of demand for our English learner community in Vietnam India and Brazil especially during COVID-19 when we’ve seen enormous interest from the LatAm region as well” Van added.

In Vietnam where Van is from English learners spend a lot of their disposable income on online or offline English training. “However the majority of English learners still struggle to improve their speaking skill because other people don’t understand them or they’re afraid to speak it” she said. ELSA was designed to give them an accessible resource to help improve their pronunciation and confidence when speaking English.

Other apps focused on English pronunciation include FluentU and Say It. Van said one of ELSA’s main advantages is its proprietary voice recognition AI tech.

“What’s unique about our AI is that we’ve collected the largest amount of accented English voice data from millions of users that we have used to train our AI model over the last few years which gives us a higher accuracy in recognizing and understanding non-native English speakers around the world” she said. “The other existing voice recognition technologies available by comparison might understand native speakers well but have a hard time understanding non-native accented English learner communities.”

Instead of providing feedback about individual words ELSA’s app also corrects individual sounds and gives users detailed information on how to improve their pronunciation including “very advanced prosodic speaking features like intonation rhythm and fluency to help them speak English more naturally something that our competitors don’t offer” Van added.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVkYWlseWJlYXN0LmNvbS9hbWVyaWNhcy1jYW5jZXJvdXMtbGVnYWN5LWZvci10aGUtZGVzY2VuZGFudHMtb2YtdGhlLWtpZG5hcHBlZC1hZnJpY2Fucy13aG8tYXJyaXZlZC1vbi10aGUtbGFzdC1zbGF2ZS1zaGlw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,America's Cancerous Legacy for the Descendants of the Kidnapped Africans Who Arrived on the Last Slave Ship,"In Africatown Alabama everyone remembers the daily blizzard of filth and decay from the International Paper mill’s stacks.

“Sometimes the ash was so thick you couldn't see five feet in front of you like being in a snowstorm or dense fog” W. Mae Jones said. Now in her eighties she’s lived there for a half-century.

When the cloud billowed youngsters darted home. Their mothers needed extra hands.

“If you didn’t bring the clothes in off the line you would get little brown and grey spots and have to wash everything again” Ruth Ballard said. The 85-year-old former nurse and lifelong resident recalled that “you would have to re-wash them wash your car out. The odor was terrible.”

Across from Ballard’s modest brick home dry sugarcane stalks rustle in the winter wind their long shadows rippling across a five-acre community garden mostly dormant under the dim sun and overhead power lines.

“They have greens turnips collards mustards kale broccoli tomatoes sweet potatoes Irish potatoes butterbeans” Ballard said.

For 70 years falling ash was an unavoidable part of life in the majority-Black community nestled among the wooded bayous and rivers just three miles north of downtown Mobile Alabama. The problem grew in the 1960s when Scott Paper expanded into one of the world’s largest mills next to IP local shorthand for International Paper.

Ballard said both mills offered free car washes to Africatown residents “anytime day or night.” Vehicles still corroded.

“It not only ate the paint but whatever the car was made out of it ate that too. Whatever the chemicals falling it was that potent” Ballard said.

Limited access to health care heightened the clouds’ more perilous costs.

“I have a sister and two brothers who died as a result of cancer” Ballard said. “Then another brother and myself are twice survivors of cancer.”

The youngest of her brothers was 65. Ruth Ballard has been clear for 14 years now.

“My husband died of cancer three years ago” Jones said.

When Rev. Chris L. Williams Sr. arrived at Africatown’s Yorktown Missionary Baptist Church in 2006 he was stunned.

“I think we had about 20 funerals right in a row that year” from a flock of about 200 the state trooper-turned-pastor recalled. “That's way out of normal.”

After talking to his congregation Williams sent a questionnaire into the community. Cancer was widespread. Williams looked at the heavy industry encircling Africatown: paper mills petroleum tanker farms power cement asphalt and chemical plants. He organized community meetings and called the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

“They told me it’s not a cluster and I told them you got all these people dying from cancer” Williams said. ‘They said it had to be this or that… They know what they’re talking about I guess.”

Williams contacted lawyers anyway. Prospective counsels’ initial enthusiasm faded.

“They would say ‘We know there’s something there’ and take soil samples then go and talk to whomever and come back and say ‘nothing’s there.’ Then they wouldn’t answer the phone anymore” Williams said.

North Alabama firm Stewart and Stewart finally took the case. When filed in 2017 the initial action listed 248 plaintiffs.

As legal motions were volleyed the story’s scope exploded thanks to an unprecedented historic discovery and a merciless unpunished crime that began a centuries-long saga.

Family Business

Africatown was a punctuation mark on centuries of terror.

When Maine native Timothy Meaher entered Mobile in 1835 it was a gateway to the American frontier. He and his brothers made fortunes in river traffic lumber and land.

Meaher wagered he could defy the 50-year-old federal law against importing African slaves. In July 1860 his schooner Clotilda with a belly full of kidnapped African souls slipped past the darkened city docks and toward vast tracts of Meaher-owned Mobile-Tensaw Delta land. In the canebrake and Spanish moss the perpetrators offloaded 110 frightened starving ill captives then steered the Clotilda upriver and set her ablaze.

News of the crime quickly blazed across the region with stories appearing in outlets as far away as Brooklyn. Federal agents arrested Meaher but he insisted he was on another of his ships and offered eyewitnesses. He was also friends with federal prosecutors and the judge. Charges were dropped.

After his release on bond Meaher moved the Africans between properties to elude detection by investigators. Eventually they were sold or divided up among the Meahers. Of them 16 men and 16 women went with Tim Meaher. His brothers took another 28 people.

On Jan. 10 1861 the case against two Meaher accomplices was eventually dismissed while the case against the Clotilda’s captain was continued. Alabama seceded from the Union the next day.

When they were finally emancipated after the Civil War the kidnapped Africans asked Meaher to return them to Africa. He refused. Gradually they bought small parcels from Meaher and built their own community in what was called Plateau. Raised self-determined and free the Africans lacked the deepest psychological shackles of many of the American-born Blacks around them.

“We are one of the few groups in America that know where we came from” Theodore Arthur said. A noted saxophonist Arthur identified himself as president of the original Africatown Direct Descendants of the Clotilda and a fourth-generation descendant of Clotilda captive Pollee Allen.

Arthur said he conferred with Sylviane Diouf for her award-winning and exhaustive 2007 book Dreams of Africa in Alabama. She called Africatown “the first [town] continuously controlled by Blacks the only one run by Africans.”

Those Africans planted the seeds of memory in new soil and grew something familiar. Their independence–they farmed hunted fished established their own business district school and governing structure– rankled many. In 1906 and 1907 lynchings occurred on Plateau/Africatown’s western edge. Those murders said historian David Alsobrook a former director of both the Clinton Presidential Library and the History Museum of Mobile felt like a message to Africatown’s population to “know their place.”

Weeks before the 1929 stock market crash the IP mill opened on land leased from the Meaher family between Africatown and the waterfront. Mobile County Probate deeds show IP finally purchased the land several decades later.

Meantime city sewer water and garbage pick-up were denied Africatown until the mid-‘60s according to a 1967 Southern Courier report. Residents complained that whites would sneak in to dump trash. When the city code required the Meahers to improve numerous shotgun shacks rented to Africatown residents they demolished the ramshackle homes instead.

“People have lived happy and healthy for years without running water and sewers” Tim Meaher’s grandson Augustine Jr. told a Southern Courier reporter. “He don’t need garbage service… He don’t need a bathtub – he’ll probably store food in it. Wouldn’t know how to use it.”

Almost simultaneously Mobile rezoned the area for heavy industry. The Southern Courier reported Scott Paper construction went up where the shacks once stood.

To date the Meahers still hold upwards of 260 acres in and around Africatown. Toxic industries lease much of that land.

In the late 1980s a new bridge was needed for the increasing flow of tractor trailers and tanker trucks barreling through Africatown. When its road was expanded to four lanes it wiped out Africatown’s central business district. That retail was never replaced.

In 2013 public attention turned to a Plains All-American tar sands pipeline carrying the caustic slurry under Africatown’s Mobile County Training School playground. Originally running into storage tanks near the Africatown-Cochrane Bridge over the Mobile River a scheduled flow reversal necessitated removal of the old pipe as a safety measure.

“That was probably the smart thing for Plains to do” President of the Mobile Environmental Justice Action Coalition Ramsey Sprague said. MEJAC was founded in 2013 by frustrated Africatown residents.

“The school system knew about [the pipeline] all along” activist and retired United States Marine Corps Major Joe Womack said. “So did a couple of people in the community but they never had the guts to stand up and tell anybody about it.”

The public fracas resulted in a $75000 donation from Plains All-American. It went toward a new baseball diamond and roof for the school.

Womack is wary of the Meaher family’s gradual acquisition of neighborhood property lots he claims appear derelict. He suspects they want it rezoned from residential to business.

“If my Mama’s house looked like that we’d get fined by the city” Womack said.

Womack cited the area’s population apex as over 10000 in the late 1960s—former pro baseball player and Africatown native Cleon Jones guessed 4000—but said it has winnowed to roughly 1700. The presence of four churches within its one-square-mile confines testify to once greater numbers.

City-data.com gave its median income as $25000 some $14000 less than Mobile’s overall median. Some Africatown homes appear sound. Several others are worn even dilapidated in testimony to the withering forces of Southern life.

Out of Sight Out of Time

In 1989 IP’s Mobile mill released more than 200000 pounds of carcinogenic chloroform normally associated with paper and pulp mills into the air. Three years later Scott Paper released 630000 pounds of chloroform according to the Birmingham News.

Kimberly-Clark absorbed Scott Paper in 1995. Mobile operations continued.

In 1999 Environmental Protection Agency scientists said a dozen dangerous pollutants were found in the air near Africatown with chloroform 100 times higher than safe levels. Among the volatile organic compounds were chloromethane benzene and ethylbenzene hexane naphthalene and toluene.

The federal government began regulating highly toxic dioxins with the 1990 Clean Air Act. In 2000 IP announced the closing of their Mobile mill.

“Ten years is about the time you would expect the largest paper company in the world to explore litigating getting around those types of regulations and in the end deciding they'd rather close shop than conform” Sprague said.

“IP bulldozed everything the whole plant left everything in the ground” Womack said. Most of the massive tract is vacant now covered in tall grasses and scrubby trees. Cracked concrete stumps jut from the former foundation. A pipe company occupies the easternmost portion.

Womack and others claim proper remediation of dioxins and furans was avoided. Sprague went to the Alabama Department of Environmental Management’s (ADEM) offices in Montgomery the state capital to find the exit plan IP is required to file.

“I met with [ADEM Director] Lance LeFleur and asked about IP’s plan. He said ‘It’s here’ and looked but couldn’t find it” Sprague said. “He called his solid waste guy in to look also and they couldn’t find it in any of their electronic or physical files.”

LeFleur said he couldn’t recall a one-on-one meeting with Sprague though records indicated Sprague attended a pair of group meetings. ADEM’s online e-file system showed no specific remediation plans for the IP site.

“There are only certain circumstances where hazardous waste was either in the ground water or in the soil where a formal remediation plan is required” LeFleur said. That determination is made by regular ADEM inspection.

Previous EPA citations didn’t surprise LeFleur. He pointed to the difference in levels of pollutants.

“You know I live in an older home and they used to burn coal for heating and put ashes out in the backyard so there’s coal ash in my backyard but it doesn’t rise to the level of hazardous waste” LeFleur said.

Mobile’s Baheth Research and Development Laboratories began sample collection around Africatown during Phase I third-party evaluations including topographical and historical studies for PCB generators and effects on water soil and wildlife.

“That’s what made a case for $1.8 billion” Baheth’s Raoul Richardson said.

IP’s revenue was $21.743 billion in 2017 and $22.4 billion in 2019. Early that year a local reporter’s discovery of the Clotilda wreckage upriver from Africatown was announced. Covered in silt and muddy water for 160 years it arose and rejuvenated the 110 captives’ tale.

The emergence of “the last slave ship” rang globally. National Geographic visited as did network news reporters and Benin Ambassador Hector Posset.

Around the same time Zora Neale Hurston’s book Barracoon: The Story of the Last ""Black Cargo"" was finally published 90 years after she had finished it. The work is based on her 1927 visits with Cudjo Lewis the last surviving Africatown founder.

Museum ideas materialized. Dreams of historic renewal bloomed. Womack and others pushed for a “blueway” a recreational trail utilizing area waterways.

Meanwhile additional plaintiffs in the IP lawsuit swelled past 1000. Local asphalt maker H.O. Weaver and Sons were added as defendants and the case was remanded from federal court to Mobile circuit court in May 2017.

Richardson said Baheth Labs sent their report to Stewart and Stewart and a summary to MEJAC. Then he heard the law firm had contracted another lab for an additional report.

As COVID-19 spread plaintiffs received news of a tentative settlement. A letter from Stewart and Stewart dated May 29 2020 told one plaintiff: “When we began working on this case we believed that we wound [sic] find significant amounts of pollution in the community. However this did not prove to be the case. First the soil testing we performed showed that the dioxin and furan pollution was merely at background levels meaning the amounts were no different on the Africatown property than from anywhere else.”

The letter encouraged the plaintiff to agree to the “satisfactory settlement.” Though they varied the highest figure mentioned among plaintiffs was $8000. Rev. Williams said he knew of others who received as little as $200.

The settlement terms required 95 percent of plaintiffs to agree and sign releases prohibiting future action. Without that minimal percentage the letter said no one would receive settlement funds.

There were no specifics on attorney fees in the letter. According to plaintiffs the firm initially said their fees would be up to 40 percent of the final settlement.

Amidst the pandemic’s economic downturn 1090 plaintiffs signed off. A joint dismissal of complaint was filed Nov. 2 2020.

“As we have stated since this case was filed we categorically deny the allegations made by the plaintiffs. Nevertheless we determined it to be in IP’s best interest to resolve their claims. The terms of this resolution are confidential and may not be disclosed by the parties” Tom Ryan of IP said in a Jan. 11 2021 statement.

“We found tremendous amounts of contaminants that we know are known carcinogens that would definitely adversely impact their health and safety” Richardson said.

Baheth Labs’ paperwork mentioned “persistent organic pollution” or POP levels of 3000 micrograms per kilogram in soil and water samples. That included eight dioxins furans and PCBs in its congener group.

“The EPA and World Health Organization have determined that concentrations greater than 0.00003 are known carcinogens” the report read.

Lab founder M. Allam Baaheth said their work was verified by a second lab.

In a 2016 report The World Health Organization described dioxins as tied to elevated cancer rates. Its decay rate was defined as long-lasting estimated between seven to 11 years. Chlorine bleaching of paper pulp was listed as a major source.

Once in the air the toxins eventually permeate water soil and more. Although lipophilic and drawn to fatty tissue those poisons could affect a community garden too.

“If you eat the vegetables if the last time you ate it was in 2000 and 2005 that stuff would still be in your body. In fish from the waterways there would be more in chickens more in pork even more” Richardson said.

POP effects are cumulative. Their long-term concentration in humans is found through blood and human milk samples not soil.

“We never got to do those tests” Richardson said.

Baaheth was more plain-spoken. “If you’re eating the fish out of Hog Bayou up there you’re going to die” he said.

Despite numerous inquiries plaintiff attorneys Stewart & Stewart declined comment on this story.

The family which declined comment for this story has traditionally remained quiet about the Clotilda saga. In 2018 Augustine Meaher III told a West Coast reporter his great grandfather Tim wasn’t responsible. He blamed Clotilda Capt. William Foster.

In literature on the Mobile River’s “chemical corridor” of 25 manufacturers the Mobile Chamber of Commerce ballyhooed ADEM’s “fast-track permitting” and ability to work with businesses.

In early 2020 details for the Africatown Heritage House were unveiled. The museum—planned adjacent to the schoolyard with a pipeline less than a quarter mile from the old IP location—will usher visitors through historic Mobile West Africa the Middle Passage and feature artifacts from the Clotilda. Boat and land tours are sought as well.

Mobile Mayor Sandy Stimpson and other political leaders think Africatown can generate tourist dollars like Montgomery’s National Lynching Memorial. Stimpson has his own generational imprint there. His family’s lumberyard and wood treatment facility sprawls across 30 acres of what was once Africatown’s Lewis Quarters neighborhood. They sold the entire outfit in 2013 for more than $80 million.

Original movies and TV shows joining the Netflix library this week include Kid Cosmic Malcolm & Marie Space Sweepers and Hache season 2.

Mr. Deeds Pineapple Express and Erased are all leaving Netflix this week.

Prepare yourselves Netflix subscribers for a rather quiet month on the world’s biggest streaming service. The original movie Malcolm & Marie is sure to attract plenty of eyeballs this week but normally the first week of the month is jam-packed with great licensed content as well. Instead we’re getting Inception Shutter Island and not much else. I am interested in checking out Kid Cosmic but I’ll watch anything that Craig McCracken makes.

KMI,Kinder Morgan,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzAxLzMwL2lzLWtpbmRlci1tb3JnYW4tc3RvY2stYS1idXkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is Kinder Morgan Stock a Buy?,"This energy infrastructure stalwart already offers a high-yielding dividend and expects to raise its payout this year.

Shares of midstream energy giant Kinder Morgan (KMI 0.86%) are quietly outperforming the market this year. The energy sector as a whole has gotten a lift from higher oil and natural gas prices and is so far the best performing sector of 2021.

Sporting close to a 7% dividend yield shares of America's largest natural gas pipeline company could be worth owning for income investors. Let's break down the company's 2020 earnings and 2021 forecast to see if it's worth buying now.

Accurate 2020 guidance

Like most companies in the oil and natural gas sector Kinder Morgan had a down year in 2020. To its credit its full-year distributable cash flow (DCF) and adjusted EBITDA only fell by 8% and 9% respectively. All things considered those weren't bad results. And in fact they're actually quite impressive.

On April 22 just two days after May oil futures contracts turned negative Kinder Morgan reported its first-quarter earnings and provided guidance for the full year. Sizing up the potential impacts of the pandemic the company predicted 2020 DCF per share of $2.02 and adjusted EBITDA of $6.99 billion. Its actual results: $2.02 in DCF per share and $6.96 billion in adjusted EBITDA. Kinder Morgan had tweaked its guidance in the second quarter and again in the third quarter so its fourth-quarter results ended up being slightly ""better than expected."" But in reality the company achieved about what it had predicted all along.

Dividend strength

Kinder Morgan's ability to accurately forecast its full-year results even in the face of high uncertainty stems from its long-term contracts with oil and natural gas extractors which reduce the effects of short-term commodity price swings. This predictability forms the foundation of a good dividend stock. Kinder Morgan paid $1.04 per share in dividends in 2020. And it's planning to pay $1.08 per share in 2021.

Income investors will love the fact that it generates DCF that's nearly twice its annual dividend obligations. That coverage ratio means plenty of cash will be available to pay the dividend with a surplus left over that can be reinvested in the business or used to pay down debt. This is a particularly appealing attribute in an oil and gas sector stock -- the industry had a fair number of dividend cuts in 2020.

Kinder Morgan's dividend is sizable -- yielding nearly 6.8% at the time of this writing. This is over four times the yield of the S&P 500 at the moment.

Growth concerns

Kinder Morgan had originally forecast 2020 expansion capital (spending on new projects) of over $2.4 billion. Then the pandemic hit and it cut its spending plans back to $1.7 billion. Even with those lower outlays the company was able to complete its long-anticipated Permian Highway Pipeline which went into service under long-term contracts on Jan. 1 and fits nicely into its growing Texas natural gas infrastructure. It also forms the foundation of Kinder Morgan's biggest growth driver the export of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the Gulf Coast to buyers overseas.

However instead of increasing its expansion capital this year Kinder Morgan is guiding for just $800 million in 2021. This is partially because it just completed major projects like the Permian Highway Pipeline and the Elba LNG liquefaction facility. But it also has to do with the company's strict adherence to a policy of paying down debt and growing the dividend. The result is that the company is spending 65% less than it was five years ago. And its net long-term debt position has also decreased by more than 20%.

Reducing debt and preserving the dividend are admirable qualities to the extent that the company can sustain earnings over the long term. That becomes challenging though when you're investing substantially less money into the business. Unsurprisingly Kinder Morgan is guiding for $1.95 per share in DCF and adjusted EBITDA of $6.8 billion in 2021. If those forecasts prove accurate it will earn 11% less DCF this year than it did in 2019 and 4% less than 2020. And its adjusted EBITDA will be 11% less than it was in 2019 and 3% less than in 2020.

An excellent income play

Stagnant or slightly declining growth is a red flag for the long-term future of a company. Fortunately for Kinder Morgan its best-performing segment natural gas pipelines also happens to be its largest. It generated 63% of 2020 adjusted EBITDA and 59% of 2019 adjusted EBITDA. Forecasts by the International Energy Agency suggest that natural gas has better long-term potential than oil or coal and it can work well with renewables. The growth prospects for LNG in particular bode well for the U.S. which is on track to become the No. 1 exporter of LNG by 2025. What money Kinder Morgan is investing is mainly associated with expanding U.S. LNG export volumes.

It will be interesting to see if and when Kinder Morgan returns to growth. For now though the stock is a great income play because of its stable dividend and improving balance sheet. Investors shouldn't expect much from it in terms of capital gains. But given how accurate its 2020 forecast was and its plans to grow its payout shareholders can expect to receive at least $1.05 per share in dividends from the company this year. Investors looking for growth though should take a pass on Kinder Morgan in favor of other oil and gas stocks or high-growth wind energy stocks.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy81MC1jZW50LXNheXMtaGVkLWZpZ2h0LTE3MTE1MTY2Ni5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,50 Cent Says He'd Fight Floyd Mayweather,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 404 Client Error: Not Found for url: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/50-cent-says-hed-fight-171151666.html on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy81MC1jZW50LXNheXMtaGVkLWZpZ2h0LTE3MTE1MTY2Ni5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

Was he innocent?,"Martin Bashir interviews Michael Jackson in 2002

Michael Jackson was one of the best-selling recording artists ever throughout his career. In 2005 Michael’s life changed dramatically as he went on trial in a very public way. But why was Michael on trial and what happened to him as the anniversary of the trial's beginning comes around once again?

On February 28 2005 The People of the State of California v. Michael Joe Jackson began after the jury had been selected almost a month before on January 31. After allegations of child molestation were taken to police on November 18 2003 police searched Michael’s residence of the Neverland Ranch. He and his family were not home as the singer was working on a music video but on November 20 he was arrested and posted the bail bond an hour later. On December 18 2003 he was charged with seven counts of child molestation and two counts of administering an intoxicating agent for the purpose of committing a felony.

On April 30 Michael pleaded not guilty to all charges of which there were 14 in total. This was not the first time Michael had been accused as he was investigated in 1993 after Evan Chandler father of Jordan Chandler accused Michael of child abuse towards his son. There was a police investigation however the case was settled out of court and no criminal charges were ever brought to him.

However the judge in 2005 allowed for these accusations to be brought up in the 2005 case by prosecutors. The prosecution argued Michael used his home of Neverland which they called a ""fantasy hideaway"" with candy and theme park attractions to lure boys and groom them into sex and flattered their parents with gifts. There were seven main witnesses for the prosecution including journalist Martin Bashir and Michael’s ex-wife Debbie Rowe as well as seven staff members from the Neverland ranch though one of the testimonies was ruled out. Six witnesses were brought forward in defence of Michael including Macaulay Culkin and Chris Tucker. DON'T MISS The Dig real life: Is the plot of Netflix movie The Dig a true story?

Sir Paul McCartney worked hard to fill out The Beatles’ last album and even used songs that he was originally supposed to give away. One of these tracks was the legendary The Long and Winding Road. The star who claimed he wrote the song in the same style as Ray Charles first wanted to gift the song to Sir Tom Jones - on one big condition.

McCartney was at the time on very good terms with Jones and were both extremely famous around the world. Because of this McCartney sat down and wrote The Long and Winding Road for Jones to release - but he wanted to ensure that his soulful track would see the light of day. McCartney wanted to give Jones the song on the condition that he would release it as his next single. This didn’t go as planned for the Love Me Do singer as Jones’ record label decided to go ahead with another single instead leaving McCartney’s single in the sidelines.

In 2019 the U.S. Navy’s Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) filed a number of seemingly out of this world patents that could in theory revolutionize not only military aviation but just about everything. Chief among these strange new inventions is a High Energy Electromagnetic Field Generator which if functional could produce massive amounts of power with far reaching military and commercial implications. Interestingly the patent also closely resembles longstanding theories posited by UFO researchers about the means of propulsion seemingly employed by alien visitors to our world.

If you think this story is crazy you ain’t seen nothin’ yet.

Recently Brett Tingley over at The Warzone received a fresh dump of documents pertaining to these patents through a Freedom of Information Act request. The Warzone has been leading the charge on analysis on these unusual patents ever since they surfaced two years ago and are continuing the effort by pouring through hundreds of pages of reports technical drawings data and photographs released to them by the Navy.

Believe it or not an electromagnetic propulsion system that could allow the Navy to build it’s own flying saucers may not be the craziest thing to come out of these efforts. According to these newly released documents another branch of this work deals with the concept of a compact fusion reactor which among other things could allow for the creation of a “Spacetime Modification Weapon.” Per the Navy’s own internal documents this weapon could “make the Hydrogen bomb seem more like a firecracker in comparison.”

These patents were born out of the work of U.S. Navy aerospace engineer Dr. Salvatore Pais and as crazy as his inventions may sound to us the Navy clearly seems to think there may be something to them. So far it’s been confirmed that the Navy has poured more than $466000 into helping this program mature since 2017.

If the mind-boggling scope of this work hasn’t quite set it for you yet here’s how a Navy PowerPoint slide labeled “For Internal Use Only” explains the implications of Dr. Pais’ technology of course assuming it works:

If for some reason this slide is loading properly for you here’s the third bullet point regarding a Spacetime Modification Weapon typed out:

“Under uniquely defined conditions the Plasma Compression Fusion Device can lead to development of a Spacetime Modification Weapon (SMW- a weapon that can make the Hydrogen bomb seem more like a firecracker in comparison). Extremely high energy levels can be achieved with this invention under pulsed ultrahigh current (I) / ultrahigh magnetic flux density (B) conditions (Z-pinch with a Fusion twist).“

So what exactly is this new technology and more importantly… is it real? That’s where this story gets even more complicated (if the phrase “Z-pinch with a Fusion twist” wasn’t already complicated enough).

A compact fusion reactor has long been the holy grail of energy scientists and researchers and to be clear Pais isn’t the first person to suggest that he’s close to pulling it off. Back in 2018 a year before the Navy’s patent Lockheed Martin filed a patent for part of a fusion reaction confinement system that was according to their documents part of a compact fusion reactor that would be small enough to be “housed within the fuselage of an F-16 fighter jet.” You can read my full breakdown on that patent here.

A working fusion reactor would be a fundamentally different means of power production than the fission reactors found in nuclear power plants today. Technically speaking fusion reactors do already exist but they’ve never been efficient enough here on earth to actually be used for power production (the sun however is a good example of a nearby fusion reaction at a massive scale). While nuclear reactors in everything from power plants to aircraft carriers produce power by splitting a nucleus into two lighter nuclei (splitting the atom) fusion power would involve fusing two or more nuclei together into a single heavier element–most likely hydrogen atoms being fused into a single helium one.

In theory an efficient fusion reactor could effectively end humanity’s reliance on fossil fuels so while one potential application for this technology could be the most powerful weapon mankind has ever conceived that same technology could feasibly nip many potential conflicts in the bud… After all a great deal of warfare can be at its most basic levels attributed to a competition for resources. With nearly limitless power through fusion there’d be a lot less competition required.

Importantly fusion power could also be much safer than the fission means of power production we’re familiar with. While it’s a common misconception that nuclear power plants can “explode” during a meltdown like a nuclear weapon the fallout that results from such a meltdown is still incredibly severe as we’ve seen in places like Chernobyl and Fukushima. These runaway chain reactions produce a massive amount of radiation. Fusion on the other hand isn’t susceptible to this runaway effect–and even better–it also doesn’t produce nuclear waste as a byproduct.

According to Lockheed Martin’s estimates at the time their compact fusion reactor could produce a constant supply of 100 megawatts of power enough to run an entire aircraft carrier or power the homes of nearly 100000 people using only about 25 pounds of hydrogen isotopes deuterium and tritium. Not bad for something you could stick in the nose of an F-16.

Which brings us back to the perhaps-less-crazy-sounding-now work of Dr. Salvatore Cezar Pais who seems to be hot on the same trail Lockheed Martin’s team is regarding fusion power and may have also unlocked the secrets to an exotic new means of propulsion and world-ending new weapon along the way.

Worryingly Chief Technology Officer of the U.S. Naval Aviation Enterprise Dr. James Sheehy has gone on record as saying that this technology may be a further reach than our current means can manage but America isn’t the only dog in this fight.

“China is already investing significantly in this area” Sheely told Patent Examiner Philip Bonzell and “would prefer we [the U.S.] hold the patent as opposed to paying forever more to use this revolutionary technology” as he asserts “this will become a reality.” -“Docs Show Navy Got ‘UFO’ Patent Granted By Warning Of Similar Chinese Tech Advances” from The Warzone

At this point it’s impossible to say whether or not the Navy and Dr. Pais have managed to produce anything truly groundbreaking through their research and indeed the recent document dump does show at least as of when these documents were produced that they have yet to prove or disprove the premise behind his High Energy Electromagnetic Field Generator (HEEMFG) in their experiments to date.

For now it seems a sure thing that the research will continue–but there is one thing we already know for sure: If and when this technology does come to fruition it could be used to fundamentally change practically everything in our world today… or potentially just to blow it all up.

The finalists in the competition to replace the Finnish Air Force’s Hornet aircraft include Boeing’s F/A-18 Super Hornet Lockheed Martin’s F-35 the French Dassault Rafale UK’s Eurofighter Typhoon and the Swedish Gripen fighter built by Saab.

The deadline for the finalized tenders will be April 30.

This is the final stage in the country’s next-generation fighter program which started in 2018 with a preliminary call for tenders.

The request for final offers comes after Finland evaluated all five aircraft options as part of the so-called HX Challenge. In 2020 Finland put all contenders through three phases of testing. These included a capability assessment followed by simulations of various scenarios based on data gathered during two weeks of flying that each of the offered aircraft had to complete.

The Finnish government has approved 9.4 billion euros for the purchase of multi-role fighters to replace the Hornet fleet. The approved budget is not only for the aircraft but also for associated technical and training systems along with weapons sensors and other required type-specific support functions. The package must also include the changes in command control communications and computers (C4) and information systems required for its integration into the Finnish defense forces’ systems.

After deciding on the winning proposal at the end of 2021 Finland will expect to receive first aircraft by 2025. The Finnish Air Force’s Hornet aircraft are scheduled to retire by 2030.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiJ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBuYS5nb3YucGgvYXJ0aWNsZXMvMTEyOTAzNNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Air Force gets C-130H aircraft from US,"JUST ARRIVED.

MANILA – The Philippine Air Force (PAF) on Friday formally welcomed one of the two Lockheed C-130H aircraft it has acquired through a grant from the United States government.

The aircraft which came from Tucson Arizona and had a tail number of 5125 was welcomed in a simple arrival ceremony in Villamor Air Base Pasay City that was graced by PAF vice commander Maj. Gen. Florante M. Amano.

""The C-130H with (tail number) 5125 is the first one of the two C-130H aircraft granted by the US government through the US Defense Security Cooperation Agency. The aircraft will provide enhanced capability in terms of heavy airlift missions to support the movement of troops and cargoes during territorial defense security and stability and humanitarian assistance and disaster response operations"" PAF spokesperson Lt. Col. Aristide Galang said in a statement on Saturday.

Galang said a series of technical inspections by concerned committees and home station checks by flight and maintenance crew would be conducted in the next two weeks.

""The PAF will then conduct a formal acceptance turnover and blessing of the C-130H aircraft at Villamor Air Base Pasay City"" he said.

The cost of acquiring the two C-130H aircraft was earlier placed at PHP2.5 billion with the Philippines contributing PHP1.6 billion and the US about PHP900 million.

The C-130 is a four-engine turboprop military transport aircraft designed and built originally by Lockheed now Lockheed Martin.

Capable of using unprepared runways for takeoffs and landings the C-130 was originally designed as a troop medical evacuation and cargo transport aircraft. (PNA)"

Lowe died Friday and her passing marks ""a tremendous loss"" to the community Gadsden City Schools Superintendent Tony Reddick said.

Lowe was encouraged by her mother — who had a fifth-grade education – to value and strive for education. She did becoming a nurse and was honored as a top nursing home administrator.

Lowe valued learning not only for herself but for others. Some two decades ago she mentored a child during the school year and continued through the summer months. She recognized the value of study in the summer and extended it to other children.

""If we don't train these kids who's going to be our nurses? Who's going to be our doctors?"" Lowe said in a 2005 interview. ""We have to take time with our children.""

She took time giving children in Gadsden a unique opportunity thanks to the Summer Enrichment Program she founded and administered since 2001.

The program provided free tutoring supplemented education and took students on field trips and college visits with the help of certified teachers and community leaders.

Lowe's program was an amazing addition to what the Gadsden school system provides for its students Reddick said.

""We offer some summer programs"" the superintendent said ""but most are to address failures"" during the regular school year.

""Her program offered enrichment"" Reddick said providing children with experiences and the benefits of her own life experience.

""Enrichment is encouraging"" Reddick said.

Lowe's program offered children field trips to museums and cities they might not otherwise have the opportunity to see. One such trip in the early years of the program took about 30 children to Washington D.C. Other sites included the U.S. Space and Rocket Center in Huntsville.

One of Lowe's greatest priorities in the program was taking students to visit college campuses to show them opportunities.

She made valuable experiences available for students each summer Reddick said in contributions that extended beyond the summer program.

""She was an outstanding individual"" Reddick said calling her passing “a tremendous loss to the community.”

""I just hope that the summer program can continue"" he said. ""It would be a great memorial to her.""

Gadsden City Council member Dr. Cynthia Toles said Lowe's objective was helping others especially children.

""In our last conversation she asked me if I would take over the school"" Toles said.

""She was a lady that will leave a legacy behind her"" she said as a nurse a civil rights advocate and through her work for children.

Lowe was active in her church on the local state and national level. In 2015 she was crowned Queen of the National Baptist Association's Women's Auxiliary at the national banquet in Memphis Tennessee and she served as president of the Alabama Baptist Women's Association.

First Lowe made her mark as a nurse. She told The Gadsden Times about working at what became Baptist Memorial Hospital and eventually Gadsden Regional Medical Center when the small hospital was located near downtown Gadsden. It was a segregated facility at the time and Black nurses cared only for Black patients.

Lowe recalled Black mothers and newborns in beds separated by a curtain from sick people. She said nurses would try to get them out as quickly as they could before mother or baby ""caught something."" She also recalled that when the need for nurses demanded it she was asked to care for white patients.

She joked that she ""invented bottled water"" as a young mother when she carried jars of water for her children on trips to town because there was nowhere for them to get a drink of water otherwise.

Lowe saw some change such as the quiet desegregation of Baptist Memorial Hospital when a new facility was built in East Gadsden and the noisier change that came when legal action forced desegregation of local schools.

She served on the Bi-racial Advisory Committee created after a consent decree giving federal oversight to the schools working to monitor conditions for minority students in Gadsden schools.

Lowe was honored as a ""Hometown Hero"" in 2020 during a Black History Program at Mt. Pilgrim Baptist Church. In May 2019 Lowe was recognized by the Boy Scouts of America with its ""Heart of an Eagle"" award.

She was a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority had served on as board chair for Gadsden Job Corps and was a lifetime member of the NAACP and the SCLC.

Lowe and her husband Jack Lowe Jr. the first Black deputy hired by the Etowah County Commission remained attuned to local politics and civic activities after both retired.

She made one bid for political office seeking a seat on the Etowah County Commission.

She ran a close race but didn't prevail Carolyn Parker recalled. Years later when Parker ran for the same commission seat she said Lowe was determined to help her win and she did.

I can't be a husband.'

Not too long after Rob Lowe proposed to Melissa Gilbert she found out she was pregnant. When she told him the news he didn’t give her the reaction she expected or wanted.

How Melissa Gilbert learned she was pregnant

In the midst of planning her and Lowe’s wedding Gilbert felt “run-down tired cranky and just plain blah.” All of a sudden she realized her period was late. So she went out and bout a pregnancy test.

“My heart raced and my hands shook uncontrollably. I laughed and cried at the same time” Gilbert wrote in her memoir Prairie Tale. She was pregnant. The actor quickly made an appointment with her doctor who confirmed the at-home test and sent her on her way with a bag of prenatal vitamins.

“My life was about to change in ways I couldn’t begin to imagine” she wrote. “It was going to be exactly the way I had dreamed. I was beyond happy. I wanted to tell Rob the news in person so I left the next day for the Hamptons [where he was working].”

What happened when Melissa Gilbert told Rob Lowe she was pregnant

As soon as Gilbert arrived in the Hamptons she ran into Lowe’s arms thinking: “This is the man I love the man I am going to marry the man I am about to tell a secret that will make our lives perfect.” As they embraced he expressed “how happy he was that I had come back to be with him how badly he had missed me and how much he loved me.” So she told him right then and there. And he didn’t say a word.

“He walked away from me and sat down on a patio chair across the room” wrote Gilbert. “I sat in the chair opposite him and said something along the lines of ‘I know. It’s a lot. and not something we planned. But we have time to prepare. How difficult can it be? People have been having babies forever.'”

How Rob Lowe reacted to learning his fiancé was pregnant

Gilbert watched Lowe’s “face change from shocked to positively panic-stricken.” He still hadn’t said anything.

“It was like I had stepped into a bottomless pit” she wrote. “I felt the terror of falling and no one to catch me.”

Finally he spoke.

“I can’t be a father” Gilbert remembers him saying his voice trembling.

“I can’t be a husband” he continued according to Gilbert. “Melissa I can’t be a boyfriend right now either. I am so sorry. I’m so sorry. I just can’t do it. I can’t do any of it. It’s over.”

They held each other and cried.

“Both of us knew this time it really was over” she wrote. “Done. Finished.”

Gilbert flew back to Los Angeles the next day and with the help of her mother and girlfriends moved out of Lowe’s house. Not too long later she had a miscarriage.

“Now I was completely totally alone and it hurt like hell” she wrote.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmlua2ZyZWVuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDIxLzAxLzMxL3Jvc2FsaWUtc3VlLWxvd2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rosalie Sue Lowe – InkFreeNews.com,"Rosalie Sue Lowe 80 rural Rochester passed away at 3:30 p.m. Friday Jan. 29 2021 at Dupont Hospital Fort Wayne after being hospitalized since Jan. 13 2021 due to COVID-19.

Users also frequently use slang such as “stonks” for stocks “tendies” for gains or profits “gay bears” for those who expect a stock to decline for stock shorters or as a general insult and “DD” for analysis of potential trades (from “due diligence”). WallStreetBets exploded into the mainstream. Many celebrated WallStreetBets’ war on GameStop short-sellers as a populist campaign against Wall Street hedge funds.

After the dull opening of Universal’s Fall Guy Jesus God Saint Mary and Joseph let’s hope those projections stay steady. Apes plans to pull in the under 35 guy demo in a way that Fall Guy did not. Presales stateside of around $3.1M in line with what was the 3-day of Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning ($54.6M) indicate a $50M-plus debut. That start in U.S./Canada isn’t far from the $56.2M opening of Matt Reeves’ 2017 movie War of the Planet of the Apes and that would be considered solid. Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes’ has the advantage that it’s opening at a time with less competition than War of the Planet of the Apes. This sequel which takes 300 years after the events of War of the Planet of the Apes is directed by Maze Runner filmmaker Wes Ball. No Rotten Tomatoes reviews yet.

The last three Planet of the Apes movies at 20th Century Fox the latter two directed by Reeves all received A- CinemaScore’s. The Tim Burton directed Mark Wahlberg starring 2001 version landed a B- grade.

The $165M production is booked at 3700-plus theaters boosted by a two-week Imax run and PLFs. The PG-13 movie has advance screenings in Imax and PLFs Wednesday at 7PM and on Thursday starting 3PM.

Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is rolling out in 100% of its offshore footprint this week beginning Wednesday in France Italy Germany and Korea. Majors joining on Thursday include the UK Brazil Australia and Mexico. China Spain and Japan follow on Friday.

Current projections for the frame are at $80M+ internationally. Broken out that’s $70M from overseas excluding China. That market is increasingly hard to call and is also coming out of a very prosperous five-day May Day holiday stretch which saw three local films excel. What happens with Kingdom will depend on how those hold up — note also that Saturday is a working day. China at this point should be $10M+.

Looking at comps and at today’s exchange rates 2011’s Rise of the Planet of the Apes bowed to $62M internationally ($8M was from China). In 2014 Dawn of the Planet of the Apes did $127M ($37M in China) and 2017’s War for the Planet of the Apes came in at a $130M launch ($56M from China).

The other advantage to those movies were that they had 3D whereas the Ball version does not.

Overall the latest rendition of the franchise tends to perform best in a mix of the mature European majors Mexico Brazil Australia and Korea. While we do expect Kingdom to land several No. 1 openings it is likely in some cases to be topped by the continued play of a strong local title (think Korea for example).

Overseas promotion included a launch event at the BFI IMAX in London on April 25 with Ball Freya Allan Owen Teague and Kevin Durand in attendance. Andy Serkis who memorably played Caesar in the first three films of the recent franchise was also out lending his support to this one.

The recent trilogy of Planet of the Apes movies from 2011-2017 grossed $1.68 billion at the global box office. The first movie based on Pierre Boulle’s novel launched in 1968 and grossed over $32M stateside unadjusted for inflation. Several sequels were spawned in the 1970s. Burton’s reboot only made $362M-plus at the global box office and did not trigger any sequels. All in The Planet of the Apes franchise has minted over $2.1 billion worldwide.

Briarcliff Entertainment has Not Another Church Movie in 1100 theaters this weekend stateside. Pic stars Jamie Foxx as God Mickey Rourke as the devil and Kevin Daniels. Written and directed by Johnny Mack the comedy satire bills itself as “This is not a Tyler Perry Movie.” Expect single digits for the film.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcmFuZGRyaXZlci5jb20vbmV3cy9hNjA3MjIyNDMvaG93LXdlZC1zcGVjLWl0LTIwMjQtYm13LW0tY2Fycy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How We'd Spec It: 2024 BMW M2 M3 and Our Other Ideal M Cars,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a60722243/how-wed-spec-it-2024-bmw-m-cars/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcmFuZGRyaXZlci5jb20vbmV3cy9hNjA3MjIyNDMvaG93LXdlZC1zcGVjLWl0LTIwMjQtYm13LW0tY2Fycy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cmVwdWJsaWMuY29tL2FydGljbGUvMTgxMzQxL3dlc2xleWFuLXByZXNpZGVudC1ub3QtY2FsbGluZy1wb2xpY2Utc3R1ZGVudC1nYXphLWVuY2FtcG1lbnTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why I'm Not Calling the Police on My Students' Encampment,"The encampment now grown to roughly 50 tents may be fostering a sense of community among protesters but it hasn’t been kumbaya for everyone. Several Jewish students were outraged by the messages about genocide and freeing Palestine. Did this mean freeing the region from Jews? The expressions “Globalize the Intifada” “Glory to the Martyrs” and “Terror is justified as long as Palestine is occupied” indicated toleration if not support of Hamas an organization that justifies raping women and killing babies as long as you call them Jewish settlers. A few students showed up with an Israeli flag and were shamed on social media. Their counterprotest didn’t result in productive conversation alas. But it didn’t spill into violence either and my team did its best to make sure that was the case.

I’ve checked in with many Jewish students individually and sat down with a group to talk about their fears—and their complaints about faculty bias. Amazingly to them and to me a few professors took votes in their classes to decide whether they should hold class in the encampment. Minority rights? Not something these faculty seemed concerned with at least not until the provost reminded them that they could not force any student to support a cause with which the professor happened to agree. Of course faculty are free to support any cause they like but whatever political acumen they believe themselves to possess they are not free to impose this on their students. The Jewish students opposed to the protesters seemed glad to be able to talk openly about their concerns. I emphasized to them that I could not protect them from opposing views but that I could protect their safety and capacity to pursue their education.

There was some graffiti vandalism after the encampment settled in and we let people know that if that continued the university would have to step in. Fortunately that didn’t continue and so far almost all the protesters seem eager to find a constructive path: to make their arguments about divestment and about boycotts. They know that I have long been on record opposing these arguments but I will try to listen to them with an open mind. Ultimately it is the Board of Trustees that will decide about investment policy. Myself I am eager to find ways of supporting Gazan relief efforts and of doing whatever we can to promote a sustainable peace in the region that would acknowledge the rights of all parties. I’d like to think students know that.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdhbWVzaW5kdXN0cnkuYml6L2FjdGl2aXNpb24tdG8tcGF5LTIzNG0tZm9yLXBhdGVudC1pbmZyaW5nZW1lbnTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Activision to pay $23.4m for patent infringement,"A jury has ruled that Activision Blizzard will pay tech incubator Acceleration Bay $23.4 million for patent infringement.

As reported by Law.com the May 3 ruling comes after the incubator began its legal action back in 2015.

The case filed in the US District Court for the District of Delaware claims that patents for networking and broadcasting were used in Activision's multiplayer title.

The publisher owes Acceleration Bay $18 million in copyright infringement for World of Warcraft and $5.4 million for two Call of Duty titles.

Jurors were asked two questions to reach a verdict among them was ""Did Acceleration Bay prove by a preponderance of the evidence that Activision's products as identified below infringe one or more claims of the following asserted patents?""

In response to the question the jury was then asked after verdict to ""reasonably compensate Acceleration Bay for Activision's infringement of Acceleration Bay's asserted patents.""

While the case against Activision Blizzard has been decided in favor of the tech incubator it has also filed similar patent infringement suits against EA Take-Two and Amazon Web Services.

In response to the ruling Activision Blizzard said ""While we are disappointed we believe there is a strong basis for appeal. We have never used the patented technologies at issue in our games.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmhhd2FpaW5ld3Nub3cuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMDcvbWFuLXdoby1yZWNlaXZlZC0xMjVtLXNldHRsZW1lbnQtaHBkLWFycmVzdGVkLWd1bi1jcmltZXMv0gFxaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaGF3YWlpbmV3c25vdy5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8wNy9tYW4td2hvLXJlY2VpdmVkLTEyNW0tc2V0dGxlbWVudC1ocGQtYXJyZXN0ZWQtZ3VuLWNyaW1lcy8_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Man who received $12.5M settlement from HPD arrested for gun crimes,"HONOLULU (HawaiiNewsNow) - A 38-year-old man getting paid $12.5 million to settle a lawsuit with HPD has been arrested for gun crimes according to Honolulu police.

Officers booked Jonaven Perkins-Sinapati Saturday afternoon for allegedly firing a gun out of a moving vehicle in Kaneohe.

Officials say no one was hurt.

Perkins-Sinapati is the same man who was driving a sedan that was being chased by police officers in Makaha in 2021.

That pursuit led to a crash leaving him in a coma for weeks and five others seriously injured.

Perkins-Sinapati filed one of three civil lawsuits blaming HPD for the wreck.

In February the city council approved the settlement.

At last check Perkins-Sinapati has not yet been charged for the latest gun offenses. Meanwhile his attorney cast suspicion on his arrest.

The criminal trial for the four HPD officers accused in the case is scheduled to start in June. All have pleaded not guilty and are on restricted duty.

Boutique Air which operates 33 eight-seat turboprop airplanes decided to start service to El Paso because of requests from people in Carlsbad where it’s provided service since 2015 under the federally subsidized Essential Air Service Program said Brian Kondrad Boutique’s vice president of business operations.

The airline also saw a demand for flights between El Paso and Albuquerque Kondrad said.

The new flights come as the COVID-19 pandemic has substantially reduced flights and passenger traffic at the El Paso airport. Passenger traffic declined 58% through November compared to the same 11 months in 2019 show the latest airport data.

Sam Rodriguez El Paso’s director of aviation said in a news release that Boutique Air not only provides new flights for the airport but also will enhance connectivity for this region.

Fastest flight to Albuquerque

Kondrad said Boutique will be the fastest way to fly commercially to Albuquerque. Currently El Paso airline travelers need to go through Phoenix Dallas or Denver to fly to New Mexico's largest city he said.

The indirect flight to Albuquerque will take about two hours and 20 minutes with a stop in Carlsbad.

The direct flight to Carlsbad will take about 40 minutes.

Driving from El Paso to Carlsbad takes about three hours. Driving to Albuquerque from El Paso takes about four hours.

Carlsbad was a hot spot for oil and natural gas drilling before the COVID-19 pandemic slowed the industry. It also has the popular Carlsbad Caverns National Park which is limiting the number of daily visitors due to the pandemic.

The oil industry connection should become important again as the pandemic subsides Kondrad said. The new flights should draw not only business travelers but people getting medical care or just traveling for pleasure he said.

Boutique will have two departures and three arriving flights daily at the El Paso airport according to a city of El Paso news release. However only one of those arriving flights will be from Albuquerque.

Tickets range from $98 to $396

A roundtrip flight to Carlsbad costs $98 for a nonrefundable ticket and $198 for a refundable ticket. The roundtrip cost to Albuquerque is $196 for a nonrefundable ticket and $396 for a refundable ticket.

The airport's Rodriguez said Boutique Air will allow El Pasoans to ""experience flying on a private(-like) plane without the cost of one.""

Kondrad said Boutique’s slogan is “fly private for the cost of commercial.”

The airline has agreements to connect its flights with United and American airlines. Flights can be booked through Boutique Air's website or through United and American if connecting to those airlines Kondrad said.

Boutique which has offered commercial flights since 2014 serves 34 cities across the country including two cities being added in coming weeks Kondrad said.

“We connect smaller communities to major hubs” under the Essential Air Service program Kondrad said.

However last year the airline began expanding flights outside the program to serve other cities as it’s doing with the El Paso flights he said.

Boutique saw openings to other markets as major airlines reduced flights due to the pandemic Kondrad said.

Boutique’s passenger revenue has decreased during the pandemic but “we’re financially supported by the government so it’s easier (for us) than the majors (big airlines)” he said.

House Bill 40 sponsored by Rep. Angelica Rubio D-Las Cruces and others would make it unlawful to operate a private detention facility in New Mexico. It would also prohibit the state or any county sheriff’s office or other government entity from entering into a new agreement or renewing an existing agreement. Detention facilities now operating would be allowed to complete the terms of existing contracts.

During the public comment section more than 20 people spoke in favor of the bill none in opposition. It passed on a 3-2 vote in the House Consumer and Public Affairs Committee but both Stefani Lord R-Sandia Park and Randall Pettigrew R-Lovington made it clear that their votes against the bill should not be seen as a defense of private prisons.

Lord said she received a phone call from Estancia Mayor Nathan Dial who told her the town of about 1600 people gets about two-thirds of its tax revenue from the Torrance County Detention Facility which is owned and operated by CoreCivic formerly the Corrections Corporation of America. The 910-bed facility houses federal prisoners immigration detainees and county inmates according to the town’s website.

“If this passes we can say goodbye to the town of Estancia. There will be no town” Lord said. “I understand the other points of view but we are going to lose an entire city.”

Rep. Harry Garcia D-Grants who is not a committee member and did not vote expressed similar concerns for his hometown where the Northwest New Mexico Correctional Center is located. The facility which can hold up to 744 inmates is also owned and operated by CoreCivic.

He said if the prison were shut down the town would lose 250 jobs. That would come on top of the recent closure of the Marathon Petroleum refinery in nearby Gallup which resulted in more than 200 workers losing their jobs.

“I understand the concerns and we do need to have a plan but we are in great danger of losing everything in that town if this happens” Garcia said.

Michael Eshleman county attorney for Otero County said there should be a grandfather clause for existing facilities. The Otero County Prison Facility and the Otero County Processing Center for immigration in Chaparral are both operated by Management and Training Corporation but owned by the county.

Eshleman said the county has outstanding bonds on the facilities that won’t be paid off until 2028.

“Whether or not we should have these facilities Otero County has them” he said adding that the only revenue they have to pay off the bonds is from the prison.

But former Chaparral resident Uriel Rosales said the private prisons have worked to limit the opportunities for residents there.

“People in Chaparral have little control over how this industry is affecting its development” he said. “My community can’t take any more years of being forced to work in inhumane jobs using human suffering as a business model.”

New Mexico has the highest percentage of private prisons in the nation according to a 2019 report by The Sentencing Project. More than half of the prisoners in the state are being held in private facilities. The national average is just over 8 percent.

Many of those commenting on the bill argued that private prisons routinely have poorer services and living conditions for inmates and lesser pay and more dangerous working conditions for staff. They provide an incentive for increased incarceration and a disincentive for rehabilitation.

“Some things I don’t believe should be for-profit and corrections is one” said House Consumer and Public Affairs Committee Chair Liz Thomson D-Albuquerque.

State Corrections Secretary Alishia Tafoya Lucero said the administration opposes the bill “in its current form” because the state would lose 3000 beds and doesn’t immediately have the capacity to replace them.

“I want to be very clear when it is safe and reasonable to convert from private to public we will” she said. “But to do so requires planning.”

The bill now goes to the House Judiciary Committee. A similar bill introduced by Rubio in 2019 failed to clear that committee. And given the opposition by the Corrections Department it is not certain that the bill would be signed by the governor this year even if it were to pass.

But Rubio made it clear to leaders in the towns that now house private prisons that they need to start planning now for whatever will come next.

“Private prison will end. That’s my promise as a legislator. If not this year it will happen” she said. “So we need to start working on a transition plan for these communities.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

It's no wonder the Amalfi Coast is one of the world's most alluring destinations on Earth. What was a collection of humble fishing villages until the 1950s has become an international symbol of glamor the epitome of la dolce vita.

So how do you plan a trip to this glitzy destination without breaking the bank? And which hotels restaurants and experiences are actually worth splurging on? Read on to find out.

Getting There

The closest airport is Naples International Airport (NAP) and from there you can take a ferry train or car to the coast. In 2019 United launched seasonal direct flights from Newark Liberty International (EWR) to Naples International (NAP). Award flights are available from 33000 miles each way. Delta has some award flight availability for upwards of 93000 points round trip but you'll have to make at least one stopover in Rome. Other mileage redemption options include Air Canada's Aeroplan American Airlines AAdvantage and Iberia Avios.

From Naples the absolute best way to get to the coast is by private car transfer but that'll cost you between €100 and €120 ($112 to $135) each way. The cheapest way to get to Sorrento — the gateway to the Amalfi Coast — is to take the Circumvesuviana train but it's also the least comfortable way to go. A good alternative is to take the ferry from the port of Napoli to Sorrento which will cost a much more reasonable €13.20 ($14.83) one way. Renting a car is another option but be aware that the sharply curving narrow coastal roads are not the easiest to navigate — and drivers from this part of Italy are notoriously bad.

Also keep in mind that when you go — and how far in advance you book — will affect the price of flights and hotels. Summer is high season on the Amalfi Coast so you can expect flights and hotels to be most expensive then. Most hotels close for the winter usually from the end of October until Easter. Your best bet for reasonably priced hotels and flights is to go in the spring or fall. According to Skyscanner the best time to book a flight to Italy is 12 weeks out.

Where to Stay

Though the Amalfi Coast is known for having some of Italy's glitziest hotels you can find budget options for less than $50 per night by searching OTAs like Booking.com. Unfortunately points-based hotels are extremely limited. Marriott only has one hotel in Naples and Hilton has just one hotel in Sorrento.

However it might be worth becoming a member of the Leading Hotels of the World's Leaders Club if you want a truly extraordinary stay in this part of the world. Several of the Amalfi Coast's most storied and glamorous hotels — including Le Sirenuse in Positano Palazzo Avino in Ravello Hotel Santa Caterina in Amalfi and the Grand Hotel Excelsior Vittoria in Sorrento — are LHW members.

If your budget allows it you could spend a few nights in an Airbnb or low-cost hotel and then splurge on a night or two at one of those properties which are truly the crème de la crème of the Amalfi Coast. Going during the shoulder season will also help you save on rates at these hotels which can double or triple during the high season.

Where to Eat and Drink

Another way to soak up some of the glamor of the area's most gorgeous hotels without splurging on a room is to stop by for drinks or a meal. At the al fresco Franco's Bar at Le Sirenuse an Aperol Spritz will set you back €12 ($13) — a pittance compared to the nightly room rates which can run you €1632 ($1830) per night.

The Michelin-starred Rossellini's Restaurant at Palazzo Avino is one of the best places on the coast for fine dining. A tasting menu dinner there will cost between €150 and €180 ($168 to $202) which isn't cheap but is a lot less than paying upwards of €770 ($864) for a room. Here waiters donning white jackets glide around the restaurant depositing artful dishes like Mediterranean lobster alla catalana and saffron risotto. If you like fine wines ask the sommelier for a tour of the hotel's wine cellar and he or she will certainly oblige.

Of course there are plenty of moderately priced restaurants like Ristorante Da Costantino in Positano and Kasai in Praiano which serves delicious food in a charmingly rustic environment.

For a quick espresso and a pastry stop by the historic Pasticceria Pansa in Amalfi. And remember if you want to save your hard-earned cash drink your espresso standing up at the bar like the Italians do. Normally an espresso costs €1 to €2 ($1.12 to $2.24) at the bar but the price spikes if you sit and get table service. The same goes if you want to grab a panino at lunchtime. Many bars and cafés offer premade panini that they'll heat up for you to take out or eat at the bar.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLWh0dHBzOi8vb25lbWlsZWF0YXRpbWUuY29tL3NoZXJhdG9uLXJlZGVzaWduL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wait Some Sheratons Are Actually Nice Now?!?,"I never thought I’d say this but… I think I might actually want to stay at a Sheraton again?!

The problem with the Sheraton brand

Sheraton is a brand that has never appealed to me:

Sheratons have no brand consistency with some properties being fairly nice and some being awful

Sheratons across the board are incredibly generic and seemingly have no theme or unique amenities that give you a sense of place or brand; not that I love Le Meridien’s faux-French theme but at least the brand in theory stands for something

It’s not that I’m “above” staying at mid-range brands like Sheraton but rather Sheraton has historically just not been a reliable brand and I’d choose just about any comparable brand over it.

And I’m not alone in feeling this way. Even before Marriott acquired Starwood Starwood had long struggled with positioning the Sheraton brand given how soulless and inconsistent it was.

The Sheraton brand is being rethought

In 2018 it was announced that the Sheraton brand would be refreshed though as you’d expect this isn’t an overnight process. Hotels are owned by investment firms rather than Marriott so for a brand to be refreshed hotel owners have to be onboard with the concept.

Marriott has provided an update on how the Sheraton refresh is going noting that the plan is for 40 Sheraton properties to be refreshed by 2022. The new vision is already available at Sheratons in Phoenix Denver Tel Aviv Dubai Guangzhou and Mianyang.

So what should we expect from the new Sheraton brand? The intent is that transformed Sheratons are “community hubs” described as follows (and obviously this is a bunch of marketing speak and I feel like virtually every hotel brand tries to describe itself this way):

The new approach for Sheraton creates an intuitive and holistic experience with places to connect be productive and feel part of something. The layered design approach balancing a sense of timelessness with a fresh and modern feel aims to create an environment where guests feel comfortable and at ease whether working meeting or relaxing.

Lobbies are supposed to be “modern-day public squares” described as follows:

At the heart of the new Sheraton experience is the lobby. This has been re-imagined as the “Public Square” of the hotel; a holistic open space that invites people to join together or be alone amongst others creating a sense of energy and belonging. With a flow that is natural intuitive and uncomplicated guests have what they need within arm’s reach all set against an inviting backdrop that feels warm and comfortable yet refined.

As someone who greatly values quality coffee when traveling I love that Sheraton is investing in a lobby coffee bar concept at redesigned properties hopefully with barista-made drinks:

Built with its global productivity-focused guest in mind Sheraton’s new elevated food & beverage philosophy creates a focal point in the lobby experience. Part bar part coffee bar part market the Coffee Bar Bar is a central pillar of the new Sheraton vision transitioning guests seamlessly from day to night with food & beverage options that are locally-sourced easy to consume while working and customizable to accommodate all tastes and time schedules.

Redesigned guest rooms and club lounges are intended to “champion productivity” and are described as follows:

In the new guest rooms guests are welcomed into a bright well-lit space with warm residential appeal comprised of soft finishes and light wood tones accentuated with black metal accents. The rooms have been reimagined with new tools for productivity such as a height-adjustable work table integrated power and charging and layered lighting; while still retaining some of the classic Sheraton signature amenities including the luxurious Sheraton Sleep Experience platform bed. The guest bathroom has also been completely redesigned with new and modern walk-in showers and bath amenities by Gilchrist & Soames. The Sheraton Club Lounge an exclusive space for Marriott Bonvoy Elite members and Sheraton Club level guests has also undergone an upgrade as part of the transformation. The new design ensures the space is welcoming elevated and purposefully designed for a layered and engaging experience that transitions seamlessly with activations from morning to evening. Guests will find updated food and beverage offerings premium amenities enhanced connectivity and 24/7 access to provide a private environment.

Refreshed Sheraton properties look shockingly gorgeous

The marketing speak is one thing but the pictures of Sheraton properties that have been refreshed actually look great and like hotels I’d want to stay at.

Take the Sheraton Tel Aviv for example which I stayed at a few years ago. It was a good value at the time but was most definitely not luxurious. Check out my review for some pictures of this hotel because you won’t believe that the below pictures are of the same hotel.

For example here’s the new lobby:

And the new coffee bar:

And here are some of the guest rooms:

Seriously everything about this actually looks really nice which I’ve never felt before about a Sheraton. I’d go so far as to say that the public spaces look more like a St. Regis than a Sheraton (the guest rooms definitely still feel a bit less elegant than a five-star brand but they still look great).

In fairness properties outside the US are often nicer so let’s take a look at the redesigned Sheraton Denver for a sense of what a redesigned US property could look like. Here’s the new lobby:

And the new coffee bar:

And the new club lounge:

And the new standard guest room:

And the new suite:

Seriously are these hotels beautiful or beautiful?

Now of course it goes without saying that hard product is just half of the story. These new properties look great but Sheratons could also certainly use a soft product update from service to club lounge offerings to amenities if the hope is that people will pay more to stay at a Sheraton.

Bottom line

The Sheraton brand is in the process of being refreshed. While all brands get a makeover at some point I have to say that new Sheraton properties impress me. Well at least that’s the case based on the pictures I’m seeing.

I have gone out of my way to avoid Sheratons though next time I find myself in a city with one of these refreshed Sheratons I’ll make a point to stay at one of these properties. Here’s to hoping the properties are as nice as they look and that the soft product doesn’t disappoint too much.

What do you make of these refreshed Sheratons? Has anyone stayed at a Sheraton that has received a makeover? Are they actually this nice?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vZnJlcXVlbnRtaWxlci5jb20vbWFycmlvdHQtaW5zdGFudC1zdGF0dXMtbWF0Y2gtY2hhbGxlbmdlLWZyb20taWhnLWhpbHRvbi1oeWF0dC1hbmQtYWNjb3Iv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,[Registration Closed] Marriott instant status match challenge from IHG Hilton Hyatt and Accor,"Update 1/30/21: Marriott has closed registration for the status match challenge. This offer was never expected to be permanent and given the reduced requirements and faster path to elite status for those who had any status last year I’m not surprised to see this pulled for now. It seems likely that this will come back again but for now it’s dead.

The original post follows.

~~

Well if there is anyone out there left who doesn’t have Marriott elite status wrapped up for the foreseeable future you can now parlay your status from Hilton Honors World of Hyatt Accor Live Limitless and IHG Rewards Club into an instant Marriott status match. Maintaining status will require either 5 nights (Gold) or 15 nights (Platinum) in the next 90 days after registering. If you’re eligible this could certainly be a decent offer since you get status benefits immediately rather than having to wait until you complete the challenge.

The Deal

Marriott Bonvoy is offering a status match challenge that will award instant elite status and the chance to extend status for a minimum of one full year with qualifying activity.

Direct link to request a match

Competitor status being matched in this offer includes: Hilton Honors Gold or Diamond = Marriott Bonvoy Platinum World of Hyatt Explorist = Marriott Bonvoy Gold Globalist = Marriott Bonvoy Platinum Accor Live Limitless Gold = Marriott Bonvoy Gold Platinum or Diamond = Marriott Bonvoy Platinum IHG Rewards Club Platinum or Spire = Marriott Bonvoy Platinum

Note that you will need to show proof of status in the competitor program and at least one stay in the past 12 months with that program

To maintain upgraded status you will need the following stay activity within 90 days of being upgraded by Marriott: Marriott Bonvoy Gold = 5 nights within 90 days of activation Marriott Bovoy Platinum = 15 nights within 90 days of activation



Key Terms

The 90-day period begins when the member is officially upgraded

The number of registrations will determine how long the status challenge will be available (i.e. this may be available for a limited time)

It may take a few days to determine eligibility

Eligibility requires uploading proof of corresponding elite status in one of the four competitor programs and at least one stay in the prior 12 months from the registration date at a participating property in that program

If members complete the challenge it counts toward Lifetime status

Paid nights at a qualifying rate count toward the promotion.

Nights spent while redeeming an award are ineligible and do not count toward the promotion.

and do not count toward the promotion. Rooms booked through most third-party online retailers and select travel agency bookings are ineligible to earn for this promotion.

Marriott Vacation Club® owner-occupied weeks are not eligible for credit.

Stays at Marriott Executive Apartments® and Homes and Villas by Marriott International are not eligible for credit.

Quick Thoughts

My first thought is for those folks who lament the Hilton program by saying “If everyone is elite nobody is elite”. Marriott certainly seems to be doing everything it can to swell the ranks of elite status this year. Between giving everyone credit for half the elite nights required for the status they earned last year and some good targeted offers we’ve previously asked if it might be worth mattress running Marriott elite status.

And truth be told I think a lot of readers are likely to have a path to Platinum status that is as short if not shorter. After all if you have one Marriott personal credit card and one Marriott business credit card you would have 30 nights toward elite status — more than enough for Gold and 20 nights short of Platinum. If you had any Marriott status last year and have a business and personal credit card your path to Platinum is likely only 7 nights.

On the other hand if you don’t have a reduced path like that available already and particularly if you have an important stay coming up where having elite benefits now (instead of sometime down the road) would be valuable for you it would absolutely make sense to register for this promotion now and enjoy elite benefits for almost the entire rest of 2020. If you naturally reach the number of nights required for elite status in the course of the challenge I assume that you won’t need to complete the challenge (that is to say that if you’re at 43 nights now and do the challenge you should get Platinum status at 50 nights – before completing the 15 nights required for the challenge). The challenge would essentially give you the benefits before you’ve earned them. That’s not at all a bad deal for those in the right position.

Greg and I previously discussed on the podcast that it probably isn’t worth mattress running seven nights no less fifteen (unless of course you have a great use for the status in the coming year).

All of that is to say little about Marriott Gold — mostly because there is little to say about it. Marriott Gold gives you 2pm checkout at most properties and a couple more points per dollar spent but that’s it. You need Platinum status for free breakfast / lounge access so that’s the one to shoot for here.

The nice thing is that Hilton Gold or IHG Platinum — both statuses that you can get with a single credit card that carries an annual fee under a hundred bucks — match to Marriott Platinum. Getting free breakfast and/or lounge access at Marriott for 90 days courtesy of a match from IHG Platinum (which you could have thanks to the old $49 credit card that is no longer available to new applicants) is a pretty good deal.

Keep in mind also that Marriott base and Silver members can also take advantage of this offer if they have status with another program.

As a reminder the key benefits of Marriott Platinum status are 4pm checkout at most properties and free breakfast / lounge access at most properties. That said benefits vary a bit. At Ritz-Carlton you get neither free breakfast nor lounge access. At Courtyard by Marriott you get a credit of $10 per person for up to two guests to use for food at the market. It is a confusing system that required creating a resource page to check on your benefits so see this resource page for more (but keep in mind that elite benefits aren’t currently guaranteed given the pandemic so you’ll want to check with individual properties to see how they are handling some aspects of the program):",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGVsaWVybWlkZGxlZWFzdC5jb20vcGVvcGxlLzEyMjc4Ny1tYXJyaW90dC1zdGFsd2FydC1tb3Zlcy10by1nZW5lcmFsLW1hbmFnZXItcm9sZS1hdC1mYWlybW9udC1hbW1hbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Marriott stalwart moves to general manager role at Fairmont Amman,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.hoteliermiddleeast.com/people/122787-marriott-stalwart-moves-to-general-manager-role-at-fairmont-amman on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGVsaWVybWlkZGxlZWFzdC5jb20vcGVvcGxlLzEyMjc4Ny1tYXJyaW90dC1zdGFsd2FydC1tb3Zlcy10by1nZW5lcmFsLW1hbmFnZXItcm9sZS1hdC1mYWlybW9udC1hbW1hbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

The changing climate is starting to impact geopolitical risks. As the world moves away from a carbon economy oil and gas are likely to diminish in importance while the issue of food security is becoming more important.

This will have an impact on countries’ relative power to one another — and one of those countries that may stand to gain from climate change is Russia. As the earth warms huge areas of Siberia are starting to open up to farming and grain production.

BRINK spoke to Rod Schoonover the former director of environment and natural resources at the National Intelligence Council under U.S. Presidents Obama and Trump.

SCHOONOVER: As temperatures go up both globally and regionally what you’re seeing is a northerly shift in crop production zones in the Northern Hemisphere. Regions in Canada the United States and especially in Russia that were once deemed non-productive for agriculture are becoming productive.

Siberia Is Opening to Agriculture

There are some open questions still about CO2 fertilization and its effects on crop yields but there’s no question that we are seeing a shift towards the Poles in the plant world. So for example in Russia you can expect whole swaths of Siberia and other parts of the Tundra to become more favorable.

I don’t want to put it all down to climate because there are also technological improvements in terms of agricultural yields but Russians are quite aware of climate change effects. They don’t have a strong climate denial industry inside the country and climate change is pretty well embedded into their agricultural ambitions.

BRINK: How will climate change impact food security or insecurity more generally?

SCHOONOVER: There are a number of global trends affecting food security. One of those has to do with the world population which is expected to hit about 10 billion people around 2050.

One of the great things that we’ve done over the last 50 years is to move people out of extreme poverty but this will ultimately change their diets. Therefore you have more people moving away from grains towards meat and more water and land-intensive fruits and vegetables. Even without climate change this would be putting stress on the global food system.

Russia understands that they need to build an economy for the 21st century by taking less advantage of climate change that’s happening now and building towards taking advantage of it in the near future.

Climate Change’s Impact on Russia’s Agriculture

And then you have this shift of production poleward. So for example corn is now being grown in North Dakota and that comes at the expense of some of the more southerly production zones in the United States. In other parts of the world like Europe you may see a production zone moving completely out of a nation over time into another nation.

BRINK: On the Russian side how does this play into their geopolitics?

SCHOONOVER: The agricultural sector in Russia suffered a terrible drought in 2010. Since then the Russian government has really started to map out self-sufficiency in the food space. They have a plan to become an agricultural superpower for wheat sugar beet livestock and some other cereals.

The Kremlin understands that they need to build an economy for the 21st century. I would say that they are taking less advantage of climate change that’s happening on the ground now and building towards taking advantage of it in the near future.

If you’ve ever been to Siberia it’s just this vast tract of land that’s largely frozen and doesn’t have a lot of infrastructure. There are some other things that would need to be put into place to take full advantage of climate change effects but if you pay attention to their food policies and what they’re doing then they are clearly telegraphing that they intend to be a beneficiary of shifting food patterns that are coming about at least partially because of climate change.

The Decline of Oil As a Geopolitical Risk

BRINK: More broadly does this mean that we’re going to shift away from a geopolitics of oil towards seeing food as a critical resource?

SCHOONOVER: I wouldn’t expect it to be as fast a transition as some other people think — it seems like we’re holding onto fossil fuels much longer than it seems wise to. I do think historians between 2050 and 2060 will probably make the judgment that there was some kind of transition in our current period to a different set of critical national resources.

BRINK: Does that mean that the Middle East becomes less significant?

SCHOONOVER: That depends on how they adapt to these global shifts and the degree to which they continue to depend on oil and gas. There’re a handful of countries who are quite wealthy. What do they do with that wealth? Do they invest it further into different types of renewable energy or desalination or things like that? Or do they just try to keep the oil pumps going?

According to an industry study the threat of direct and indirect cyberattacks on global businesses is significant with up to $5.2 trillion in economic impact being at risk over the next 5 years[1]. Another study reported that 50 percent of global businesses are not prepared to deal with cyberattacks[2].

The Global Cyber Forward program combines Mastercard's cutting-edge capabilities in cyber security with those of leading public sector organizations to create secure digital ecosystems at a national local and city-level. This partnership with DIFC will help boost cyber readiness and resilience across the financial industry enabling effective cyber security oversight through the Dubai Financial Service Authority (DFSA) Threat Intelligence Platform (TIP) that was launched in January 2020.

DIFC is home to over 2500 financial related companies including 17 of the world’s top 20 banks and over 240 FinTech and Innovation companies. DIFC continuously develops innovative laws and regulations enabling the future of finance. Earlier this year it launched the first GDPR-compliant data protection laws and the most comprehensive money services regime in the region.

Commenting on the announcement His Excellency Essa Kazim Governor of Dubai International Financial Centre said: “This global partnership between DIFC and Mastercard supports the National Cybersecurity Strategy and Dubai Cyber Security Strategy. As the leading financial center in the MEASA region we are committed to being at the forefront of initiatives including cyber security that will advance the finance industry globally regionally and in Dubai. Firms and individuals will be able to benefit from our collaborative approach to managing the issue and see Dubai as the region’s safest place to undertake their financial activities.”

Ajay Bhalla President Cyber and Intelligence Mastercard said: “Cybercrime is one of the biggest threats to consumer trust. Without trust we cannot do business – more so now than at any other time in history. We are developing and embedding the latest cyber technologies in collaboration with our partners around the world to help advance security and trust in the digital ecosystem. Our partnership with DIFC will help to create more secure and thriving digital economies.”

“DIFC has the region’s most robust and resilient legal and regulatory framework. Our partnership with Mastercard recognizes the importance of cyber security and will help DIFC clients and the global finance industry accelerate their digital agendas safely and effectively. Collaborating with leading like minded organization on cyber security is a key factor that will help us drive the future of finance” said Arif Amiri CEO of DIFC Authority.

“Knowledge sharing and access to secure innovative technology are our best defense as we address the cyberthreats that lead to cybercrime. Our strategic partnership with DIFC is a significant milestone and one that sets a secure foundation for fostering a strong cyber-resilient ecosystem that inspires trust in the digital economy” said Khalid Elgibali Division President Middle East and North Africa Mastercard.

This program builds on other cross-industry partnerships helping to boost cyber readiness and resilience across the financial industry. Last year Mastercard introduced its first European Cyber Resilience Center to drive collaboration between the public and private sectors in addressing threats faced by the payments ecosystem. With support of the Canadian government the company’s Intelligence and Cyber Center in Vancouver is designed to accelerate innovation in digital and cyber security artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things.

Learnings gained from this initial program will be applied across the globe through Mastercard programs and other public-private partnership efforts. Together they will secure everyday transactions while delivering even greater trust in every interaction through the continued application of emerging technologies.

DIFC continues to lead the MEASA region’s efforts to provide an enabling environment for innovative businesses that contribute to the development of the financial services and technology industries. The Center continues to strengthen and expand its value proposition as a global hub for the future of finance by building new capabilities and driving thought leadership in cyber security that will enable secure digital business models drive innovation and develop future economies in the region and beyond.

But when she was ordered by airport staff to go and line up with the other black women it became clear that something wasn’t right. Security staff had assumed she was a migrant domestic worker not a student.



When she got to the American University of Beirut (AUB) where she was heading to take up a Mastercard Foundation scholarship she asked other students about the incident and was told this was a symptom of how domestic workers are treated in Lebanon.



At the airport domestic workers are told to line up and wait for their sponsor to pick them up. By this stage they have already signed a contract to work for the sponsor. But for many of them once they hand their passport to the sponsor their human rights quickly seem to evaporate.

Before long Igiraneza was living in Beirut and finding herself being treated as though she was one of the domestic workers.



“I would go to the supermarket and the supermarket staff would ask ‘Where is your madame your employer? Do you have a debit card?’ And since most of the domestic workers don’t have a bank account the supermarket staff would often ask if the card that I was carrying was mine just to make sure I hadn’t stolen it from my employer.”



She says it is because 90% of black women in Lebanon are migrant workers so it is the first thing people think of when they see a black woman.



However at university she also found people not wanting to sit next to her because of the colour of her skin.



“So I was convinced that I had to do something about the racial discrimination against – and working and living conditions of – African women in Lebanon.”



Igiraneza came from a semi-rural town in Rwanda Africa. Her father is a nutritionist and she had come to Beirut in 2016 to study for a BSc in environmental health. She was being supported by a Mastercard Foundation scholarship and under the scholars programme she was learning about transformative leadership and being encouraged to get involved in social enterprises and think of ways she could contribute to her own or vulnerable communities in Lebanon.



She discovered that the human rights abuses are well-documented internationally by human rights organisations including Human Rights Watch (HRW). In addition to physical and sexual abuse domestic workers suffer from delayed (or non-payment of) wages forced confinement and are refused time off.



In fact numerous domestic workers have been driven to suicide or have died in mysterious circumstances in Lebanon HRW reported. One high-profile case was that of Alem Dechasa-Desisa 33 an Ethiopian domestic worker who worked as a maid and



In 2008 an HRW report found an average of one death a week of domestic migrant workers from unnatural causes including falls from tall buildings and suicides. The high level of abuse caused some countries to ban their citizens from working in Lebanon.



At AUB with friends from the Africa Club Igiraneza became involved in running awareness campaigns about the conditions domestic workers face and a project on sexual and reproductive health for them.



Most of them are from countries like Ethiopia Nigeria Ghana Cameroon and Togo and when they signed up the contracts were in Arabic a language of which they have no knowledge Igiraneza says.



“In those contracts they are told they have to work eight hours a day and get one day’s break a week and basic conditions. But then when they reach Lebanon they are on very different conditions.”



She says that part of the problem is that at the airport their passports are taken away and from that point on no matter how badly your employer treats you you can’t leave until they give it back to you.



Exploited by employers



As a consequence too many employers exploit the situation to treat domestic workers badly.



For example one of the domestic workers she met through her campaigning work was a woman from Kenya who had been promised one day off a week and work limited to eight hours a day but when she got there found she was expected to work 12 hours with no break.



Sometimes she would cook but not be allowed to eat the food; instead she was confined to eating bread cheese and spaghetti for four years.



“She was physically and mentally harassed and developed mental health problems. She had to escape but she couldn’t leave without a passport so couldn’t go home” Igiraneza says.



“Another woman I met from Ethiopia at the project on sexual and reproductive health told us her employer raped her and when she became pregnant kicked her out of the house. But later he went to her and took the baby and now she doesn’t have any rights to her own child.”



Many women who do escape their employer end up destitute and turning to prostitution to earn a living.



As a result of the cases she came across Igiraneza started raising awareness about the racial discrimination and living and working conditions that migrant domestic workers face.



“I didn’t feel safe or have a space off campus to advocate for this cause so I started conducting my activism on campus. Many of the students and faculty members at AUB have migrant domestic workers. Thus I thought conducting these kinds of campaigns on campus would challenge the students and the faculty to treat their workers as human beings not slaves.”



She and her fellow Mastercard Foundation Scholars ran workshops with speakers who work with domestic workers to talk about the situation. They also held an awareness day where they attended classes in the uniform of a domestic worker.



“It was to tell people: ‘Look you treat me alright because I am at university but I am no different to a domestic migrant worker in your house so if you can respect and treat me well you should go back to your houses and give the same respect to the worker in your house’.”



Cast onto the street



The bomb blast in Beirut in August 2020 which caused more than 200 deaths and injured 7000 more made hundreds of thousands of people homeless having destroyed huge numbers of houses. This added to the nightmare for domestic workers because many employers cast them onto the street without paying them – or giving back their passports.



“Some were protesting so that countries would repatriate them however some of the countries they came from didn’t do anything. So a few Mastercard Foundation Scholars and I set up a GoFundMe page to fund repatriation and we raised US$4500 enough to send 12 workers and two children back to Sudan” Igiraneza says.



She feels having a scholarship that focuses on transformative leadership has helped her grow as a person from the shy girl she was when she arrived in Beirut in 2016 to someone who is now confident enough to stand up for what she feels is right and use transformative leadership skills to help people around her.



“For me transformative leadership skills include standing up for what you believe in making an impact in your community and inclusion of marginalised people which in Lebanon mostly means migrant domestic workers” she says.



Maha Haidar Makki director of the Mastercard Foundation Scholars Program at AUB says the scholars programme at AUB seeks to support transformative leadership in a number of ways.



Through a social venture challenge and a social enterprise fund mentorship and seed funding are provided.



Students are given a rich exposure to social impact work via the university’s Center for Civic Engagement and to expertise in entrepreneurship training provided by the Center for Research and Innovation.



Continuum of capacity building



“There is a clear framework for transformative leadership that every scholar goes through. It is a continuum of capacity building workshops exposure visits and volunteering opportunities as well as mentorship and support in the implementation of a community-based project” Haidar says.



“Another important aspect is the fact that the Scholars Program allows us to admit students in cohorts and we work on community building within AUB as well as across the network of institutions within the Program. This makes scholars feel empowered by being part of a network of likeminded young leaders.”



Today Igiraneza having graduated at AUB has moved to Scotland to study for an MSc in Global Health Policy at Edinburgh University with ambitions to go into health policy in Rwanda – and continues to be supported by a Mastercard Foundation scholarship.



“I feel there are a lot of health inequalities globally and maybe the only way to address them is through the health policy field” she says.



But she is still involved with her peer alumni and current scholars at AUB in giving workshops to domestic workers in Lebanon on sexual and reproductive health. However because of COVID-19 they cannot run the workshops face-to-face and are instead conducting them virtually through recorded videos. They have received US$2500 funding from the Mastercard Foundation to continue their work.



They also plan to supply emergency kits that include sanitary pads infant formula and diapers to 50 domestic workers who have children since most of them can no longer afford these necessities due to the current economic crisis in Lebanon. This is a community-based project sponsored by the Mastercard Foundation at AUB.



A webinar on ‘How can universities improve their social impact?’ is available on University World News’ YouTube channel here. The webinar was held on 27 January with 2200 registered participants. The panel speakers were Hilligje van’t Land secretary general of the International Association of Universities; Lorlene Hoyt executive director of the Talloires Network of Engaged Universities; Maha Haidar Makki director of the Mastercard Foundation Scholars Program at the American University of Beirut; and Maryam Mohiuddin founder and director of the Social Innovation Lab Lahore Pakistan.

The seed round is led by Cherry Ventures and Seedcamp.

A number of angel investors with backgrounds in fintech and HR tech also participated. They include Paul Forster (founder of Indeed) Taavet Hinrikus (founder of TransferWise) Carlos Gonzalez-Cadenas (previously an exec at GoCardless but now a partner at Index Ventures) Philip Reynolds (VP of Engineering at Workday) and Matt Robinson (founder of Nested).

Part fintech part HR play Ben has built an employee benefits platform to enable SMEs to offer much more personalised and flexible benefits to employees. The U.K. startup does this via a SaaS for managing benefits including a benefits marketplace combined with per-employee debit cards powered by Mastercard.

The idea is to give employees more individual choice around which benefits they choose while making it easy to on-board additional providers. This can be via the marketplace or through whitelisting merchant or merchant categories via the employer issued Mastercards such as food and drink or travel and mobility or a specific co-working space etc.

“While most companies offer benefits in order to attract and engage team members and ultimately drive productivity most solutions don’t deliver the desired outcomes” Ben co-founder and CEO Sebastian Fallert tells me. “To have impact offerings need to work for the individual employees; after all a ‘benefit’ that’s relevant for somebody working from home in their mid-40s could be next to useless for a new starter in their 20s”.

Fallert says that providing the required level of personalised benefits has been impossible for most small to medium-sized companies due to the “high cost and complexity” of creating and administering personalised programmes. This has seen only large enterprises able to offer flexible benefit programmes where employees get to pick from a range of options. Ben aims to remedy this.

“The Ben software platform allows companies to load funds and set individual spend rules on how these can be used” explains Fallert. “Employees are then able to choose from group benefits such as private medical insurance mental wellbeing services or dental plans while a real per-employee Mastercard opens the door to pretty much any product or service in a tax-efficient and compliant way”.

The result is a “win-win” says the Ben CEO. “Employees get tailored benefits and companies only pay for what’s used take advantage of tax exemptions and preferred pricing while streamlining the administration”.

The Ben platform is currently used by smaller and mid-market companies especially those with a distributed team. “It’s these firms in particular that have to deal with the growing complexity of their programmes to keep up with a more diverse and increasingly remote/distributed workforce” says Fallert.

Meanwhile Ben has three revenue streams: a SaaS fee; interchange revenue every time its cards get used; and of course affiliate revenue from its marketplace.

Adds the Ben CEO: “One of our core hypotheses is that there are so many amazing services out there that simply can’t get through to companies as they’re often not relevant for all employees such as debt consolidation or fertility treatment. With Ben they get easy distribution on standard commercial terms while companies get to offer an additional benefit without any additional overhead”."

USMNT vs. TRINIDAD & TOBAGO



Orlando is hosting the first friendly encounter between the teams since 1994. Overall the United States holds a 19-3-4 record in the series dating back to 1982. In the last meeting the USMNT recorded its largest ever margin of victory against Trinidad & Tobago with a 6-0 victory before 23921 at FirstEnergy Stadium to book a spot in the 2019 Concacaf Gold Cup Quarterfinals. Gyasi Zardes and Aaron Long scored two goals apiece Christian Pulisic and Paul Arriola also tallied goals while Zack Steffen and the U.S. defense kept a second consecutive clean sheet in an impressive result that also tied the USMNT’s largest ever margin of victory in a Gold Cup game.



UPCOMING COMPETITION



The first match of the year is a prelude to three significant competitions in 2021 for both the senior team and the U-23 USMNT. The Concacaf Olympic Qualifying Championship will be held from March 18-30 in Guadalajara Mexico to determine the confederation’s representatives at the Olympic Games in Tokyo that summer.

In the meantime the USMNT kicks off the summer with the Concacaf Nations League final four. As the winners of League A’s Group A the USMNT takes on Honduras in one semifinal while Mexico and Costa Rica will square off in the other with the winners competing for the inaugural Nations League title. The matches are scheduled for the FIFA window in the first week of June with the venues and times still to be determined.

The following month the U.S. will compete in the 2021 Concacaf Gold Cup in search of its seventh confederation championship title. The USMNT has been drawn into Group A with Canada Martinique and a third team to be determined through a qualifying tournament. The United States last lifted the trophy in 2017 when Jordan Morris netted the game-winner against Jamaica in the 2-1 victory.

Those games serve as prelude to the start of 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifying which will feature an eight-team final round and commence in September of 2021.



IN ORLANDO



This will be the USA’s seventh visit to Orlando and the fourth since the opening of Exploria Stadium. In the most recent visit on Nov 15 2019 Gyasi Zardes grabbed a brace Jordan Morris tallied a goal and an assist while Aaron Long also scored in the comprehensive 4-1 victory against Canada in Concacaf Nations league play. With the win head coach Gregg Berhalter became the second-fastest coach in USMNT history to reach 10 victories.

Here's what you should know about the popular dating app,"Tinder is an online dating app famous for its swipe and match feature that offers paid subscriptions.

is an online dating app famous for its swipe and match feature that offers paid subscriptions. To sign up for Tinder you'll need to download the app and provide basic information like your age location gender and gender preferences.

Founded back in 2012 Tinder is a dating app site that matches singles in your area and around the world virtually.

On launch Tinder was a pioneering app in the online dating sphere. Following its massive success similar dating apps  including Hinge PlentyOfFish and OkCupid - all owned by the same parent company Match Group - began to appear.

In general Tinder's app functions pretty simply: you swipe to indicate who you are most interested in. Anyone can sign up for free but Tinder does offer some subscription-based premium features.

Here's everything else you should know about Tinder.

How does Tinder work?

Tinder is commonly referred to as the ""hookup app"" but at its core is a dating app that like competitors aims to offer a gateway to relationships and even marriage for a more tech-savvy generation.

It upends traditional dating culture which typically requires you to go out and interact with strangers in physical spaces. Instead it brings that diverse dating pool that you may - or may not - have had access to at a bar or club straight to you.

To use Tinder you must create a profile noting your current location gender age distance and gender preferences. Then you begin swiping. After you see someone's photo and a small biography you can either swipe left if you dislike them or right if you do like them. If another person swipes right both of you are matched and you can begin chatting with one another.

Tinder previously used a notorious Elo rating system to match users essentially ranking people by a user-driven attractiveness algorithm. The more people who liked and swiped right on a person's profile the higher they were ranked. That profile would then be displayed alongside those with a similar rank.

As a result it created dating bubbles defeating a dating app's purpose and advantages which is to more quickly and efficiently find the perfect match beyond the simple physical attractiveness factor.

It has since abandoned this method and in a 2019 blog post the company revealed some of what goes into its matching system. ""Our algorithm is designed to be open"" the company wrote. ""Today we don't rely on Elo - though it is still important to consider both parties who Like profiles to form a match.""

According to Tinder the app prioritizes users who are most active and matches you with others who are active at the same time. It doesn't collect race or income data but considers those details you inputted when you signed up - how far someone is from you their gender and age.

With the help of newer features like Smart Photo which identifies the photos that Tinder thinks work best for you Tinder can spit out your next potential date.

How to create a Tinder profile

To create your Tinder account you will need to download the mobile application for iOS or Android or access the site from a web browser. You will then need to link a mobile phone number Facebook or Gmail account.

During sign-up you'll be prompted to input information on your gender date of birth interests and sexual preferences. Users are even able to include external links like Spotify and Instagram. Also be prepared to give Tinder access to your location while using the app and upload photos.

After you'll begin a tutorial on how to use the app which will show you the application's functionality and basic features. Once on the app homepage you can see that there are buttons that affect how you interact with a potential match below every profile. Here's what they are and how they work:

Rewind: The yellow rewind allows you to reverse a potential match you skipped on. Rewind only works if you are a Tinder Plus or Gold subscription member.

X: The red X skips the person you don't have an interest in and dissolves any chance of matching. You can also do this by swiping your finger to the left on your mobile device.

Heart: The green heart indicates you have an interest in someone. You can also swipe on a profile picture with your finger for the same effect.

Lightning Bolt: Boost or Super Boost is a premium feature that puts your profile at the top of the list in your area for 30 minutes so that your profile can get more views which can lead to more matches on Tinder.

Once you've made a match both parties will be notified and you can video call with one another Tinder user or send messages using Reactions which are Tinder's version of emojis.

Tinder Premium Services

Although Tinder is free there are tier-based subscription options that you can pay monthly or yearly for. You can subscribe to premium services for Tinder in increments of one month six months or a year. To upgrade your Tinder account you'll need to go into your Settings.

Tinder Plus

At $9.99 a month this tier allows for unlimited swiping the ability to change your location with Passport more ""Super Likes"" an additional ""Boost"" and ""Rewinds"" each month. You can also limit information people see about you like your age and distance and navigate the app ad-free.

Tinder Gold

Starting at around $18 a month you get all of the Tinder Plus benefits but can also see the profiles of everyone who liked you before you say yay or nay as well as a curated selection of top picks for potential matches that change daily. They'll come with particular labels that describe them with a selling point like ""Creative"" ""Adventurer"" and ""Fashionista.""

Tinder Platinum

Priced at the higher $32 to $40 a month depending on age all the Tinder Gold and Plus benefits are included at this tier. Additionally when you ""like"" someone you have priority over those who are not subscription-based and when ""Super Like""-ing someone you can send a message before a match. This option is currently only available as an upgrade from the other two tiers and can't be purchased outright.

Along with last year’s first-round selection of tackle Broderick Jones and recent free-agent signings of starters James Daniels in 2022 and Isaac Seumalo in 2023 it seemed as though the job was complete. So when the Steelers were getting ready to make their fourth-round pick few were expecting it to be used on another offensive lineman.

Mason McCormick of South Dakota State would hear his name called with pick No. 119 and become the newest Steeler. Was this pick just meant to add depth or did the Steelers look past other obvious needs thinking they may have found a potential starter in McCormick? As a prospect McCormick was considered a versatile offensive lineman with the ability to play all five positions even though the 57 starts of his college career were spent exclusively at left guard. With the highest possible picks being used to select both tackles and a center over the past two drafts it would appear that McCormick’s fastest (only?) path to playing time is at guard. McCormick is most likely pushing someone off of the roster. Who might that be?

The Steelers rebuild their offensive line

In May of 2022 Omar Khan was named general manager of the Steelers and Andy Weidl was hired for the assistant GM job. Weidl has largely been credited with the push to rebuild the offensive line. Since their hiring Khan and Weidl have replaced every offensive lineman they inherited except left tackle Dan Moore and Daniels. Using back-to-back first-round picks on college left tackles demonstrates their desire to upgrade from Moore. In their first go-around at free agency they spent money on guards Seumalo and Nate Herbig. Both started their careers with the Eagles when Weidl was in the player personnel department in Philadelphia. Things looked solid with Daniels Seumalo and Herbig giving the Steelers three veteran players to man the two guard spots.

Just a month after spending that money the Steelers would use 4 of their 30 allowed pre-draft visits to meet with more guards. At the 2022 draft they would use a seventh-round pick on Spencer Anderson. Anderson like McCormick was touted to have the versatility to potentially play all five positions. He would make the final 53-man roster as a depth player on the interior as the Steelers had four players (Moore Jones Chuks Okorafor and Dylan Cook) make it specifically as tackles.

It doesn’t make enough sense to use a fourth-round pick on McCormick simply for more interior depth with Seumalo Daniels Herbig and Anderson already on the roster. It’s highly unlikely that the Steelers would keep all five. At tackle Moore is the only one with a season’s worth of experience. Jones and Fautanu are locks to make the final 53. Cook lacks experience and versatility but would the Steelers use a fourth-round pick just to replace the fourth tackle when Anderson already supplies that same ability?

Related Pittsburgh Steelers select Washington OT Troy Fautanu with 20th overall pick in 2024 NFL Draft

McCormick is most likely pushing someone off of the roster. Cook Herbig and Daniels are in the final years of their contracts but Daniels is the only one who wasn’t hand-picked by Khan and Weidl. Moving Daniels would create an additional $8.25 million in 2024 cap space. If the Steelers are happy with their alternatives it would make sense to include Daniels in a trade before the start of the season and it would make more sense out of drafting McCormick instead of addressing other needs.

By the end of training camp don’t be surprised if Daniels has a new home elsewhere. Even though it was against FCS competition don’t be shocked if McCormick’s 57 starts at guard are the reason why.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL2RhaWx5bm9ydGh3ZXN0ZXJuLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA3L2NhbXB1cy9sZXR0ZXItd3JpdGluZy1jYW1wYWlnbi10by11bmRlcnJlcHJlc2VudGVkLW1jY29ybWljay1mcmVzaG1lbi1idWlsZHMtY29tbXVuaXR5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Letter-writing to McCormick freshmen builds community,"In late summer incoming McCormick freshmen of underrepresented communities open their mailboxes to find words of congratulations and encouragement.

The annual letter-writing campaign is organized by the Northwestern chapters of the Society of Women Engineers the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers and the National Society of Black Engineers.

Current McCormick students write the letters in the spring and Assistant Dean for Student Affairs Ellen Worsdall the faculty advisor for SWE SHPE and NSBE mails out the letters to women Hispanic and Black engineering students over the summer.

Worsdall said 38% of McCormick class of 2026 were women and over a third were from underrepresented communities. The goal of the letters is to build community especially within underrepresented demographics in engineering Worsdall said.

McCormick freshman and SWE Mentorship Director Kayla Youhanaie said she loved receiving her letter.

“(The letter) showed me that (SWE) is very active and they care a lot about their club members” Youhanaie said. “I instantly got involved when I first got here.”

SWE hosted a letter-writing event in the Technological Institute on April 30 where colored paper and markers were provided.

“We write individual handwritten notes to every student” Youhanaie said. “We like making them feel like somebody’s thinking about them.”

On Friday SHPE also held a letter-writing event in the Ford Center where they encouraged letter-writers to include introductions to SHPE and its values as an organization give advice and make the recipient excited about coming to NU.

McCormick freshman and SHPE Mentorship Chair Gisela Martinez said she hopes to build relationships between mentors and mentees in SHPE during Fall Quarter. The letters are a first step she said.

SHPE letter-writers are encouraged to leave their contact info on the letters Martinez said in hopes that this will begin to build mentorship relationships.

“I wish to give back to my community and become a mentor even if it’s through a small thing such as a letter” Martinez said.

NSBE will be holding a letter-writing event on Friday in Ford.

Prior to receiving her letter McCormick freshmen Jocelyn Luevanos said she was nervous about going to an engineering school.

Luevanos later participated in both SWE and SHPE letter-writing events because she remembered how the letters impacted her.

“It came to my house and I was like ‘Oh my gosh I got a SWE letter’” Luevanos said. “Even though you’ve already been accepted you still don’t feel like you’re really part of the NU community. (The letter) gets you excited to go to college and helps ease some of that anxiety.”

Senate Candidate Says He Grew Up on a Family Farm. Not Exactly.,"David McCormick’s origin story goes something like this: He grew up in rural Pennsylvania southwest of Scranton. He baled hay trimmed Christmas trees and otherwise worked on his family’s farm. And from those humble beginnings he rose to achieve the American dream.

“I spent most of my life in Pennsylvania growing up in Bloomsburg on my family’s farm” Mr. McCormick now a Republican candidate for Senate told Pittsburgh Quarterly in 2022.

“I’ve truly lived the American dream” he wrote in a fund-raising appeal in October. “My life’s journey — from growing up on a farm in Bloomsburg to graduating from West Point and serving in the 82nd Airborne Division growing a business in Pittsburgh and serving at the highest levels of government — reflects that.”

“I grew up on a family farm from the time I was a kid” he said at the Pennsylvania farm show in January.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3RydW1wLWJpZGVuLW1jY29ybWljay1jYXNleS1zZW5hdGUtcGVubnN5bHZhbmlhLXByaW1hcnktMTI0ODRlNjVhNjhmNDM2NGZlYzUxZWM1ZDQ2MGU1MzjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Casey and McCormick to face each other as nominees in Pennsylvania's high-stakes US Senate contest,"HARRISBURG Pa. (AP) — Democratic Sen. Bob Casey and Republican challenger David McCormick will face each other in Pennsylvania’s high-stakes U.S. Senate contest this fall as Tuesday’s primary election put the men on track for a race that is expected to cost hundreds of millions of dollars and help decide control of the Senate next year.

Casey and McCormick won their respective party primary contests after they were uncontested and now enter what is likely to be a grueling expensive and hard-fought 2024 general election campaign that culminates in the Nov. 5 vote.

Casey seeking his fourth term is perhaps Pennsylvania’s best-known politician and a stalwart of the presidential swing state’s Democratic Party — the son of a former two-term governor and Pennsylvania’s longest-ever serving Democrat in the Senate.

McCormick is a two-time Senate challenger a former hedge fund CEO and a Pennsylvania native who spent $14 million of his own money only to lose narrowly to celebrity heart surgeon Dr. Mehmet Oz in 2022’s seven-way GOP primary. Oz then lost to Democratic Sen. John Fetterman in a pivotal Senate contest.

This time around McCormick has consolidated the party around his candidacy and is backed by a super PAC that’s already reported raising more than $20 million much of it from securities-trading billionaires.

What to know about the 2024 Election

The Associated Press is the most trusted source of information on election night with a history of accuracy dating to 1848. Read the latest: Follow AP’s complete coverage of this year’s election.

McCormick’s candidacy is shaping up as the strongest challenge to Casey in his three reelection bids. McCormick has worked to shore up support in the GOP base and on Tuesday night hammered his message at his election night gathering in Pittsburgh that Casey is a do-nothing senator.

“We’re now turning to the general election and here’s the truth: Pennsylvania deserves better than Bob Casey You deserve better” McCormick said. “Bob Casey’s defining achievement in his political life 30 years in political office has been to be the son of Bob Casey Sr. That is what defines his political career.”

Casey in Washington on Tuesday to cast votes in favor of $95 billion in war aid to Ukraine Israel and Taiwan said on social media that “there are 196 days until the general election and we’re going to win.” Meanwhile the state Democratic Party unveiled a minute-long digital ad slamming McCormick as a “millionaire hedge fund executive who is lying to Pennsylvanians.”

The Senate candidates will share a ticket with candidates for president in a state that is critical to whether Democrats can maintain control of the White House and the Senate.

President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump won their party nominations easily after all major rivals dropped out. Both men made campaign trips to swing-state Pennsylvania in recent days and voters can expect to see plenty of them their TV ads and their surrogates campaigning over the next six months in a state that swung from Trump in 2016 to Biden in 2020.

Of note however could be the number of “ uncommitted ” write-in votes cast in the Democratic primary to protest Biden’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war.

In the Senate contest Democrats have attacked McCormick’s opposition to abortion rights his frequent trips to Connecticut’s ritzy “Gold Coast ” where he keeps a family home and the focus on investing in China during his dozen years as an executive at the hedge fund Bridgewater Associates including as CEO.

Casey has been a key player for Democrats trying to reframe the election-year narrative about the economy by attacking “greedflation” — a blunt term for corporations that jack up prices and rip off shoppers to maximize profits — as fast-rising prices over the past three years have opened a big soft spot in 2024 for Democrats. Indications that the U.S. economy avoided a recession amid efforts to manage inflation have yet to translate into voter enthusiasm for Biden.

McCormick meanwhile has accused Casey of rubber-stamping harmful immigration economic energy and national security policies of Biden and made a bid for Jewish voters by traveling to the Israel-Gaza border and arguing that Biden hasn’t backed Israel strongly enough in the Israel-Hamas war.

Casey is one of Biden’s strongest allies in Congress. McCormick and Trump have endorsed each other but are an awkward duo atop the GOP’s ticket after Trump savaged McCormick in 2022’s primary in a successful bid to lift Oz to his primary win.

Democrats currently hold a Senate majority by the narrowest of margins but face a difficult 2024 Senate map that requires them to defend incumbents in the red states of Montana and Ohio and fight for open seats with new candidates in Michigan and West Virginia.

A Casey loss could guarantee Republican control of the Senate.

Elsewhere on the ballot Tuesday Pennsylvanians decided nominees for an open attorney general’s office and two other statewide offices — treasurer and auditor general — plus all 17 of the state’s U.S. House seats.

For attorney general Republicans nominated Dave Sunday York County’s district attorney in a two-way race while Democrats nominated former state Auditor General Eugene DePasquale of Pittsburgh in a five-person primary field.

Democrats also nominated Erin McClelland a two-time congressional candidate in suburban Pittsburgh who has helped run various human services organizations to challenge Republican state Treasurer Stacy Garrity and they nominated state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta of Philadelphia to challenge Republican state Auditor General Tim DeFoor. McClelland prevailed despite being heavily outspent by her party-endorsed rival.

For Congress 44 candidates were on ballots including all 17 incumbents. All three incumbents facing primary challengers — Republican Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick in suburban Philadelphia and Democratic Reps. Dwight Evans in Philadelphia and Summer Lee in a Pittsburgh-based district — won their races.

Lee’s primary against challenger Bhavini Patel has shaped up as an early test of whether Israel’s war with Gaza poses political threats to progressive Democrats in Congress who have criticized how it has been handled.

Republicans nominated state Rep. Ryan Mackenzie in a three-way race to challenge Democratic Rep. Susan Wild whose Allentown-based district is closely politically divided while Democrats nominated former TV news personality Janelle Stelson from among six candidates to challenge Republican Rep. Scott Perry in a Republican-leaning district in southern Pennsylvania.

Once upon a time the nearest Mcdonald’s was in the middle of town and a rare treat. But then a retail center was built along with an Aldi a shoe store and a shiny new McDonald’s. Every Wednesday my grandmother would come for the day and if it was a particularly good toy month we would all have Happy Meals for dinner. This meant that this only child would get four McDonald’s toys every week. This was especially important during the resurgence in popularity of the 101 Dalmatians movie. Between the regular Happy Meals and the trips to toy fairs with my dad’s collectibles business I managed to amass 87 of the beloved pups including the coveted turtle though alas not the umbrella.

McDonald’s toys were a staple in our house. I loved and collected them. My dad loved and sold them at toy fairs across the country. Many of my childhood toys were abandoned but the Dalmatians have stayed with me through college marriage and a 3000 mile move to a new country. Now they belong to my children who use them as bath toys or extras in the movie trailers they like to create on their school iPads. They think it hilarious that we ate so many Happy Meals.

The toys these days don’t seem as good as the ones we had in the ’80s and early ’90s but then I feel everything I remember is tainted by a good whitewash of nostalgia these days. Every so often they still manage to hit a home run however and right now they are knocking it out of the park combining two of our family’s loves: board games and putting cute faces on inanimate objects.

While my kids loved their stuffed characters from Soul last month it is the Hasbro promotion that has stolen their hearts. We missed the Hasbro promotion of 2018 but I’ll be darned if I’m going to miss this one especially with such glorious games on offer. The current promotion includes Hungry Hungry Hippos Operation Monopoly Battleship Trouble Twister and Connect Four.

My Happy Meal game is not strong in this country however. Back in the UK my family and I had it down to a fine art. Which toys were appearing in which week. Which day they switched to the next line. Even which McDonald’s was lackadaisical with its approach where you might sneak next week’s toy in advance make a switch or even simply ask for two! Over here I am at the whim of the fast-food gods.

Generally we have been going to our nearest location but they are highly inconsistent with their toys. More often than not we find ourselves not with the latest and greatest but with a stuffed toy from Finding Dory. At last count we have had seven of Dory alone. After successfully obtaining the Monopoly toy a few weeks back we have settled on the mall-adjacent location as our best plan of attack. A mere few minutes further than our regular location we believe that the high traffic of the location caused by proximity to the mall will cause it to be the most consistent up to date and well-stocked of the southern Maine locations. Our first trip as a group yielded Hungry Hungry Hippos our second The Game of Life. On our third visit we decided to try something out and ordered seven Happy Meals for my three children we ended up with seven Operation toys. This actually works out well for us since we immediately lost three of them.

Now I begin to stretch the bartering muscles I inherited from my mother. Can we have three different toys please? Can we have something other than Hungry Hungry Hippos? What toys do you currently have? Can we switch this toy for something else please? Thus far we have been unsuccessful and have been told that each location only carries one toy at a time. While part of me knows (or wishes) this to be a fallacy the fast-food gods for now seem to be against me. Perhaps once this promotion is over we will return to our prior location and find we are given excess Hasbro toys instead of those from Finding Dory.

Can you believe that McDonald’s Japan is 50 years old this year? The company founded in May 1971 as Nippon McDonald’s Holdings Inc. and since then it has grown exponentially to offer its delicious staple and limited-time-only menu items all across the country as well as to supply us at SoraNews24 with endless opportunities for quality journalistic content.

To celebrate their 50th anniversary they’ve dedicated a section of their website to commemorating their 50-year history and also posted a time-hop video retrospective.

The video covers the company’s history from the opening of the first-ever Japanese branch in Tokyo’s upscale Ginza district shown here.

From there the video takes us past other milestones for the chain in Japan such as opening its first Japanese drive-through location (in 1977) the introduction of its beloved Tsukimi “Moon-Viewing” Burger (1991) the start of its home delivery service (2010 seven whole years before Uber Eats could bring you your McDonald’s fix in Japan) and the introduction of mobile ordering in all branches (2020).

McDonald’s Japan’s 50th anniversary website also features a section titled “Memories” with a photo-enhanced a timeline of important moments in the chain’s history. For example did you know that the first McDonald’s branch which was located on the first floor of Ginza’s Mitsukoshi shopping center in Tokyo had to be constructed in 39 hours in between the shopping center’s operating hours so as not to obstruct its business? If you’re interested in learning about how quickly McDonald’s opened branches throughout Japan when Chicken McNuggets were introduced or when they started selling value sets and Happy Meals you’ll find it all here.

▼ June 1 1990 was the monumental day when McDonald’s Japan started offering bacon potato pies.

The website’s “Road Trip” section allows you to drive a car along the path of McDonald’s Japan’s history. As the car that you control speeds along a highway for each decade there are several points you can click on that will take you to different segments about the historical context of each decade as well as the history of each of McDonald’s staple menu items. It’s like walking through a McDonald’s museum without even leaving your home.

▼ The Memories and Road Trip sections of the site can be found here.

There’s still a lot of content that hasn’t been unveiled yet with updates promised throughout the year. McDonald’s restaurants will probably start offering 50th Anniversary menu items and special deals too so we’ll be keeping an eye out for those too as the months go by. In the meantime if reading all that makes you hungry you can run to your nearest McDonald’s and enjoy the currently limited-time-only Chicken Burger with Rice Buns and Touch manga collaboration menu items to satisfy your “Makku” (or “Makudo” depending on your region of Japan) cravings!

He's also not enamored of the trend for contests and TV shows about the chase for investments. He doubts that the founders of Minnesota's biggest companies such as Best Buy's Richard Schulze or UnitedHealth's Richard Burke would have won any of them.

""There was nothing unique about their ideas"" Rao said. ""Their genius was in their strategy and skills to execute their strategy. And they just happened to build some of Minnesota's greatest companies.""

Rao notes that the founders of Google Apple and Microsoft avoided or were refused venture capital for years. They waited until they were large and powerful enough to control their own destiny.

Minnesota has had some VC-fueled winners over the last 20 years. However most were purchased by other companies before they became the $1 billion revenue-and-market value ""unicorns"" such as United Health Medtronic and Best Buy that Rao contends is the spine of a strong economy.

Rao an engineer and Ph.D. in finance taught at Harvard the University of Minnesota and most recently at Florida International University. He worked 20-plus years in venture finance and economic development in Milwaukee.

In 2009 Rao wrote ""Bootstrap to Billions."" Last year: ""Finance Secrets of Billion-Dollar Entrepreneurs."" In it Rao interviewed and analyzed the work and skills of Burke Schulze Medtronic founder Earl Bakken Fastenal founder Bob Kierlin and others.

""These are the unicorn billion-dollar entrepreneurs … who [bootstrap-and-borrowed] from startup to more than $1 billion in sales and valuation … among the world's most successful entrepreneurs"" he said.

Rao criticizes the motivation for VCs to gain disproportionate control and wealth for themselves and their investors which leads them to drive companies to go public or sell to bigger firms.

And he explains the business-finance strategies that kept the successful founders in control; from friendly individual investors to various forms of debt finance partnerships and capital-conservation strategies.

Rao said VCs fail to make money on eight of 10 ventures. So they need big success from the other two something like 300%-plus returns to produce aggregate returns that surpass what investors can make in the stock market.

VCs generally invest after a startup company's potential is evident he said. Entrepreneurs need to stay independent longer in search of greater long-term results downstream. That can be tough to do when VCs and investment bankers are dangling millions your way.

Jeff Hinck managing director of Rally Ventures which has offices in the Twin Cities and Silicon Valley presents the counterargument. He said last year's 42% jump in VC investment in the state is great news for entrepreneurs of all stripes.

""VC-backed companies have been a driver of startup activity and job growth in Minnesota for decades"" he said. ""Current and former Rally Ventures portfolio companies such as Compellent SportsEngine Total Expert and others have created thousands of net new jobs in Minnesota. Former employees have created thousands more via new startups.

""There are also a number of current $1 billion-plus [market value] VC-backed companies headquartered here. Jamf Protolabs SPS Commerce and Sezzle to name a few. And companies that are sold generate executives and employees who know what it takes for a business to succeed. They pass on knowledge which creates a more successful startup and economic ecosystem.""

A local venture capitalist recently praised the University of Minnesota-sponsored Minnesota Cup sweepstakes that is the largest pitch competition in the country.

The U's business school since 2006 helped launch 165-plus startups which have attracted $1.15 billion in capital. Seven went public since 2017.

Rao is watching. A grateful immigrant Rao said he is an admirer of Mahatma Gandhi the nonviolent father of Indian independence 70 years ago.

""The only reason [I'm] here and doing well is because of Gandhi"" said Rao. ""Independent India focused on education and developing its youth with world-class institutions.""

Rao's book is a finalist for the Eric Hoffer Award a prestigious competition named after the American philosopher for books published by academic and independent presses. Rao has aided our economy and sparked healthy debate.

There was no reason to block it as Best Buy's stock is nothing like the spectacularly volatile ""meme stocks"" of fading retailer GameStop and cinema operator AMC Entertainment Holdings.

Apparently a Robinhood staffer had meant to type BBBY the ticker symbol for the stock of Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. It was quickly corrected an honest mistake.

I made one last week too a humbling error about the value of Medtronic's interest in a new deal. Mistakes happen.

That's one way to explain how the stock price of AMC Networks went from the $40s on Jan. 22 to more than $70 last week to settle back in the $40s. Some traders eager to put a pop into AMC Entertainment must have been buying the wrong AMC.

It sure looks like a mistake to bid up the shares of struggling retailer GameStop to the point the whole company reached a value of more than $30 billion in the market too. But it's simply not fair to dismiss what the industry calls retail investors behind the massive rally as clueless novices.

One objective was buying enough options and stock to create a surging stock price that hammered hedge funds like Melvin Capital Management that had established trading positions expecting GameStop stock to decline. Spotting that vulnerability took plenty of sophistication.

We may yet find out that much of the action with GameStop AMC and the others over the last month was the work of hedge funds and other pros. But at the moment it's a tale of small investors scaling the castle walls to topple the arrogant princes of Wall Street.

There are big issues to try to grasp here including the lingering resentment that the wrongdoers of the 2008 financial crisis largely escaped punishment. Millennials also seem really sick of being lectured by their elders who had the good fortune to reach adulthood when it was easier to get ahead.

But this is not a ""this time it's really different"" moment in the market. Those don't come around very often.

The herd now speculating in stocks gathering online in places such as Reddit looks like the herds of past booms.

The principal action that shot GameStop stock into the stratosphere was a variation of something called a short squeeze and those have been going on for a long time too. A classic of the form took place in the Twin Cities more than 20 years ago in the stock of the company K-tel International Inc.

This once high-profile company seller of the Veg-O-Matic and popular music compilations announced in the spring of 1998 that it would start selling on the internet. The dot-com mania was gathering steam then and this seemed like news.

Lots of investors didn't buy the bullish case though and a move to short K-tel began.

Now short selling isn't necessarily a bad thing. While it can be done with stock options short selling generally means borrowing shares investors don't own and selling them then locking in a profit by buying back cheaper shares after the price sinks.

If the bulls keep buying though those short positions can get so costly at ever higher stock prices that the pain of getting squeezed forces the short seller to buy back the shares at a big loss. Of course that creates another buyer in a market that already has more buyers than sellers.

On one particularly wild day that spring of 1998 trading volume in K-tel was 14 million shares when there were fewer than 4 million shares outstanding and far fewer available to be traded.

The stock price spiked and almost touched $40 per share that spring from a low of just over $3 per share although it didn't stay long at that lofty level.

The fun went out of trading Internet-related stocks when the air rushed out of the bubble 20 years ago. But for those who missed that go-go era it really was a lot like what we've seen lately.

Instead of social media sites like Reddit message boards found on then-new websites like Yahoo was where the enthusiastic traders chatted up their stocks at all hours.

There was also a lot of talk about how regular folks can beat those Wall Street pros. Investors excitedly piled into companies like computer-disk maker Iomega because they were investing in what they knew and liked including Iomega's briefly popular Zip computer disk. It didn't end well of course.

There was nothing back then quite like Robinhood a stock-trading tool for smartphones that has the look of a video game. Whether it's a ""gamified"" financial app is a judgment call but I have not found a transaction I can do on the U.S. Bank app that shoots confetti across the screen.

Robinhood is also ""free"" which only means users have no idea how much it's really costing them.

And back in the old days of the 1980s or 1990s bull markets no one would have been able to click on a video of an unlikely internet celebrity like Dave Portnoy pulling three Scrabble tiles from a bag to pick the stock he's buying next.

But then as now there were complaints that enthusiasts on the internet must be manipulating the market. One of the priceless insights on just who is doing the manipulating also came from the dot-com era and the oracle who saw it so clearly was just a kid.

As described by the writer Michael Lewis a 15-year-old in suburban New Jersey named Jonathan Lebed had used an online broker often from the high school library's computers to quickly make a bundle buying and selling stocks and promoting some online. Then the Securities and Exchange Commission came knocking.

In a note the teenager wrote his own lawyer it's clear he just didn't see what he could have done wrong.

""Whether it is analysts brokers advisers internet traders or the companies everybody is manipulating the market"" he wrote. ""If it wasn't for everybody manipulating the market there wouldn't be a stock market at all.""

The need-to-know this morning

Pfizer appointed Andrew Baum as its new chief strategy and innovation officer. Baum joins Pfizer from the investment bank Citi where he served as head of global healthcare research. He is joining Pfizer’s executive committee and will report to Chairman and CEO Albert Bourla.

In a mid-stage study EyePoint Pharmaceuticals said its eye drug Duravyu failed to improve disease control compared to a sham injection in patients with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy.

Vyjuvek is a topical gene therapy for dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa an inherited disorder causes painful blisters and persistent wounds.

A deep dive into Amgen’s experimental obesity drug MariTide

There so much buzz around Amgen’s experimental obesity drug MariTide. The company simply saying it was “very encouraged” about interim Phase 2 data led to a 12% spike in Amgen’s stock — even though no new data were shared. STAT’s Elaine Chen answers some hot questions about the closely watched injectable.

Early data show MariTide a monoclonal antibody drug could potentially offer more profound weight loss than other treatments on the market. But it’s already difficult to manufacture peptide drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound — and antibodies are more complex molecules.

Although Novo and Lilly’s stocked dropped a little on Friday the companies are dominating the space and it’d be hard for competitors to catch up. The two companies are also developing next-generation candidates that are further ahead than MariTide. So even if other companies have strong contenders in the obesity space they’d be years away from an FDA approval and “so far behind [Novo and Lilly] that it’s still going to probably be hard to see how they catch up” one analyst said.

Studying stem cells and cancer in low Earth orbit

Turns out the microgravity of low Earth orbit allows scientists to study cancer growth at an accelerated clip. Catriona Jamieson of UCSD’s Sanford Stem Cell Institute is working with NASA to send tumors and stem cells into space — ferried aboard SpaceX and Axiom-3 flights to the International Space Station. STAT’s Nicholas St. Fleur chatted with Jamieson about why aging and oncology could potentially be better understood so far away from our planet.

She was inspired by a 2019 NASA study that showed that after 340 days in space astronaut Scott Kelly came back 2 inches taller than his earthbound twin.

“But then I noticed he had inversions and translocations in his chromosomes. His chromosomes were kind of mixed up in the immune cells which can happen if you have preleukemic conditions developing in your blood so that doesn’t look good” she said. “I thought maybe space is a way to understand stem cell aging when it starts to be premalignant and fully malignant but in an abbreviated time frame.”

Former Spark CTO suing for alleged discrimination

The former chief technical officer of Spark Therapeutics alleges she experienced discrimination and sexism while working there the Philadelphia Business Journal writes. Cynthia Pussinen led nearly 400 employees in Spark’s technical development and operations unit from February 2021 to December 2022.

Pussinen said she faced “repeated and ongoing acts and practices of sex discrimination by some of her male peers and colleagues most notably by Federico Mingozzi” who was the company’s chief scientific officer before leaving this past November. The lawsuit said that CEO Ron Philip allegedly told Pussinen in March 2022 that he was aware of Mingozzi’s “mistreatment” of women. But instead of sanctioning him she alleges Philip told her to “make it work” because everyone but Mingozzi is “expendable” and that “we need him more than he needs us.”

Pussinen who is now CEO of a small regenerative medicine company called Sernova is seeking unspecified economic damages along with compensatory damages for pain and suffering and emotional distress.

Merck may have a competition for ever-scarce BCG

There’s long been a global shortage of the BCG vaccine which has long been used to treat bladder cancer. This may change as FiercePharma points out. A couple of weeks back ImmunityBio won FDA approval for Anktiva an immunotherapy that’s meant to be used along with the BCG vaccine to treat patients with bladder cancer. Now ImmunityBio has partnered with the Serum Institute of India to manufacture BCG globally.

ImmunityBio framed it in a press release as “a long-term solution to chronic BCG supply shortage issues” and intends to produce the treatment “at large scale” so it can be used in combination with Anktiva. Merck has been the only U.S. purveyor of BCG since 2012 after Sanofi and another competitor bowed out due to manufacturing issues. In 2020 Merck laid out plans to boost BCG production but that will likely not come to fruition until at least next year. It’s been rationing BCG since 2019.

Notably an oncolytic virus-based therapeutic made by CG Oncology showed a complete response in about 75% of patients with late-stage bladder cancer new Phase 3 data show. If approved the drug could be used without the aid of BCG.

- Clinical trial will evaluate CX-801 as monotherapy and in combination with KEYTRUDA in patients with advanced metastatic solid tumors including melanoma renal cell carcinoma and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma -

SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO Calif. May 07 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CytomX Therapeutics Inc. (Nasdaq: CTMX) a leader in the field of masked conditionally activated biologics today announced that it has entered into a clinical trial collaboration and supply agreement with Merck (known as MSD outside of the US and Canada) for CytomX’s first-in-human Phase 1 clinical trial assessing the clinical activity of CX-801 a dually-masked interferon-alpha2b cytokine in combination with Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab).

“Interferon-alpha-2b is a potent cytokine with demonstrated clinical activity against multiple cancer types but its use has been limited by systemic toxicities. CX-801 is designed to overcome these limitations to unlock the full potential of interferon in activating the immune tumor microenvironment. With an improved therapeutic profile our goal is to establish CX-801 as a cornerstone of immuno-oncology combination regimens including in combination with checkpoint inhibitors such as Keytruda for the treatment of a broad range of tumor types” said Wayne Chu M.D. chief medical officer of CytomX Therapeutics.

“CytomX is excited to be entering into this agreement with Merck to utilize Keytruda in combination with CX-801. The product design principles behind CX-801 integrate over a decade of continuous innovation and experience at CytomX in masking potent biologic therapies.

About CX-801

Interferon-alpha 2b is an immunotherapeutic cytokine that has demonstrated clinical activity and gained regulatory approval previously in multiple cancer types. IFNα2b provides a potentially superior approach to activating anti-tumor immune responses compared to other cytokines. CX-801 is a dually masked conditionally activated IFNα2b cytokine that has the potential to become a cornerstone of combination therapy for a wide range of tumor types including in traditionally immuno-oncology sensitive as well as insensitive (cold) tumors. Phase 1 initiation for CX-801 solid tumors including melanoma renal and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma anticipated in the first half of 2024.

Merck on Thursday reported first-quarter revenue and adjusted earnings that topped expectations as it posted strong sales of its blockbuster cancer drug Keytruda and vaccine products.

The pharmaceutical giant also raised and narrowed its full-year revenue and adjusted earnings forecasts. Merck now expects 2024 sales to come in between $63.1 billion and $64.3 billion up from previous guidance of $62.7 to $64.2 billion.

The company expects full-year adjusted earnings of $8.53 to $8.65 per share up from its prior forecast of $8.44 to $8.59 per share.

That outlook includes a one-time charge of roughly 26 cents per share related to Merck's acquisition of Harpoon Therapeutics in January. The company develops immune-based cancer drugs. The guidance also includes a negative impact of 30 cents per share from foreign exchange changes.

Shares of Merck rose 4% on Thursday following the results.

Here is what Merck reported for the first quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $2.07 adjusted vs. $1.88 expected

$2.07 adjusted vs. $1.88 expected Revenue: $15.78 billion vs. $15.20 billion expected

The company posted a net income of $4.76 billion or $1.87 per share for the first quarter. That compares with a net income of $2.82 billion or $1.11 per share during the year-earlier period.

Excluding acquisition and restructuring costs Merck earned $2.07 per share for the first quarter. Both adjusted and nonadjusted profit for the period include the charge related to the Harpoon deal.

Merck raked in $15.78 billion in revenue for the quarter up 9% from the same period a year ago.

Those results come as Merck shows substantial progress in preparing for Keytruda's patent expiration in 2028. The loss of exclusive rights to the drug will likely cause sales to fall forcing the company to draw revenue from elsewhere.

But Merck has a handful of new deals under its belt and key drug launches that will help it offset those losses. That includes Winrevair a medication approved in the U.S. last month to treat a progressive and life-threatening lung condition. Some analysts expect that worldwide sales of Winrevair could reach $5 billion by 2030.

Merck is seeing ""high interest"" in Winrevair from patient groups and a range of prescribers and is making ""good progress"" in enabling access to the drug Chief Financial Officer Caroline Litchfield said during an earnings call Thursday. Several payers have already established coverage policies for the drug she noted.

""We have confidence in a successful launch of Winrevair consistent with our prior expectations and look forward to providing updates on our progress"" Litchfield said.

Merck is also cutting costs under a new restructuring program it announced in February. Those efforts aim to improve the manufacturing network of both its pharmaceutical division and animal health business.

The company recorded charges of $246 million related to restructuring in the first quarter which are excluded from its adjusted results.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDQvMTgvaGVhbHRoL2hwdi12YWNjaW5lLWFmcmljYS1tZXJjay5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Millions of Girls in Africa Will Miss HPV Shots After Merck Production Problem,"Nearly 1.5 million teenage girls in some of the world’s poorest countries will miss the chance to be protected from cervical cancer because the drugmaker Merck has said it will not be able to deliver millions of promised doses of the HPV vaccine this year.

Merck has notified Gavi the international organization that helps low- and middle-income countries deliver lifesaving immunizations and UNICEF which procures the vaccines that it will deliver only 18.8 million of the 29.6 million doses it was contracted to deliver in 2024 Gavi said.

That means that more than 10 million girls will not receive their expected HPV shots this year — and 1.5 million of them most likely will never get them because they will be too old to qualify for the vaccine in subsequent years.

Patrick Ryan a spokesman for Merck said the company “experienced a manufacturing disruption” that required it to hold and reinspect many doses by hand. He declined to give further details about the cause of the delay."

Alstom which cut its offer for Bombardier rail in September 2020 stated the price for the deal was established at €5.5 billion (US$6.7 billion) at the bottom of a range of €5.5 billion to €5.9 billion (US$6.7 billion to US$7.1 million) indicated previously.

Alstom owned 9.7% by French conglomerate Bouygues launched a €2 billion capital increase to finance the Bombardier deal in December after it had secured European Union antitrust approval six months earlier.

Toomey owns Meta Crystal Shop — where she sells crystals stones and jewelry along with incense that she said is believed to clear negative energy and restore calm.

One of these incense — Palo Santo — comes from South American trees and has been used since Incan times and Toomey said is considered “Holy wood” for its restorative qualities.

Toomey also offers tarot and oracle cards that help provide insight into customer’s lives to help them situationally. Though she was previously hosting a weekly “Tarot Tuesday” via Facebook Live she now plans to offer them as recorded sessions to share on her page on Tuesdays.

“I hope to eventually have in-person groups to share general information about the products and ideas for using them” she said.

Until then she plans to use social media platforms to share along with her YouTube channel.

The idea for these groups — which Toomey calls empowerment groups — began when she was a co-owner of the local coffee shop The Spot. There community members would come to the group meeting and share purposeful living goals.

“It was a place to share how we were growing into who we want to be” she said. “I am hoping to not be forced to do it online.”

The Spot also offered artists the opportunity to sell some of their products and it was during this time that a jewelry artist brought in some tumbled rocks and crystals that piqued Toomey’s interest in learning more about their restorative properties.

“I started researching and saying ‘I need that I want that’ and it took off” she said. “I didn’t see that coming.”

Having the tools to motivate and inspire customers is why Toomey decided that now was the time to open a storefront with her products and she hopes that her continued research and desire to add more meditative items — including candles — to her store is something her already-busy store and its customers want.

“I’ve been busy enough with customers and it’s pretty steady” she said.

However she also hopes that after the pandemic she can have a mobile store that she can take to festivals and host pop-ups.

“I’m new to the culture but I am having fun doing it” she said.

Whether it’s Coachella offering digital blooms to paid participants or Super Bowl turning tickets into collectible NFTs 2022 so far has witnessed some of the most exciting ways brands have utilized NFTs to engage with audiences.” From Dolce & Gabbana to Coachella and Adidas numerous brands are leveraging NFTs in their marketing campaigns.

Justin Waiau shares that this trend will only grow from here. “NFTs have struck a chord with the fashion industry among many others. Renowned brands are selling their clothing as non-fungible tokens besides participating in virtual fashion weeks” he adds.

Companies like Adidas have expanded their brand strategy into the metaverse. “Their collaborations with Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) and Punks Comic are the baby steps towards their mega plan to influence the metaverse” says Justin Waiau.

Besides attracting brands NFTs have become a dependable medium for artists worldwide. Today digital artwork is selling in millions on NFT platforms and artists receive royalties every time their art exchanges hands. Justin Waiau believes that “the NFT world has rewarded artists like never before. Artists consider NFTs as the future of their craft.”

Talking about virtual real estate Justin Waiau reveals that the NFT ecosystem is also witnessing massive sales of lands on platforms like Decentraland and The Sandbox. Creators on these platforms offer immersive experiences to audiences that span from mazes to colonies on planet Mars.

Lastly NFTs and crypto tokens across the globe thrive on the foundation of a young active community. NFTs are proving to be more than just hype. “The real users behind these digital assets are leaving no stone unturned to make their projects a super success. With the #WAGMI spirit felt unanimous in its communities the future of NFTs looks bright and surreal” elucidates Justin Waiau.",,,

Somebody call Elon Musk and Stephanie McMahon. Get each on a Zoom meeting titled “Robert Saleh‘s introduction.”

Musk the genius whose companies have helped progress planet Earth represents the best chance of time travel. McMahon Vince’s daughter who currently serves as WWE’s Chief Brand Officer would have no problem lassoing Saleh into the Attitude Era mix.

Why not? Saleh 41 projects every look required to battle with the big boys of the late 1990s. Carrying around that bald dome and well-put-together physique the only thing to hammer down is his finisher.

The Saleh Stunner perhaps? The Saleh-plex maybe?

Everything else is on point. Take his mic sills as Exhibit A. The rookie head coach didn’t waver in his first big-boy press conference a couple of Thursdays ago. He laid down the “All Gas No Brake” mantra like a pro thus throwing New York Jets fandom into a full-blown tizzy.

His most recent promo decided to include the Jets’ unofficial rivals the New York Giants. (Yes the term “rivals” here is loose-fitting.)

“The fanbase is so passionate … ” Saleh said of Jets fans while on the Huddle & Flow podcast with Steve Wyche and Jim Trotter Friday. “We always make fun of Michigan for kind of being more the uppity-ups sit on your hands where the Spartan fans are a little bit more rambunctious a little bit more passionate a little bit more … they’re louder.

“When we’ve played the Jets in the past versus the Giants—no disrespect to them (as) they’re absolutely a phenomenal franchise—but the Jets’ fanbase feels more invested … in the way they are just so passionate about their team.”

Cue the shattering glass. (What?!)

He’s right.

The idea of the starving rabid fanbase is as old as anything in our modern sports landscape. And the starving fanbase usually equals the more invested. (That is of course unless you’re a Jacksonville Jaguars fan living in a college football town that never shows up for its professional sports teams.)

When thinking about which Super Bowl party would be nuttiest it’s tough to find a fanbase that would surpass the Jets.

Giants fans are some of the most loyal in New York. In fact it’s been said frequently that Giants and New York Rangers fans are the two groups that show up no matter what. It’s tough to find a large percentage of fair-weathered individuals in either of those two segments.

But investment is another thing entirely.

Rewind the clock to 1994. The Rangers seeking their first Stanley Cup since 1940 produced mayhem the city had never before seen. This Canadian thing called hockey was simply a backdrop. Mark Messier Brian Leetch Adam Graves and Mike Richter took center stage in a way that put their fans through hell.

Only the starving fanbase could possibly be this invested in the outcome of every moment. Stephane Matteau’s double-overtime winner in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference Final nearly brought Madison Square Garden’s roof down.

Ask any New York Yankees fan which World Series is his or her favorite from the 1990s dynasty. In spite of the 1998 team’s dominance the resounding answer will be 1996.

Again it’s about starvation. It’s starvation that leads to investment. It’s about the downtrodden quietly building character en route to dreams and hopes on the extremely-hidden other side.

The way Yankee Stadium reacted in unison when Joe Girardi drove home Game 6’s first run is something that cannot be duplicated.

Or how about Don Mattingly’s postseason home run the prior year?

Nobody can convince me that Yankees fans were more invested than New York Mets fans during the fall of 2000. The Yanks and their fans seeking their third-straight championship viewed the Mets as more of a nuisance than an opportunity at the time. Joe Torre has since revealed the extra pressure the Subway Series put on the great Yanks dynasty. Instead of celebration Torre and the Bombers let out a great sigh of relief.

The Mets on the other hand were thirsty. It was their moment for the taking a singular series that would flip the script entirely. While no Yankees fan intentionally took his or her foot off the gas human nature simply makes a little relenting a fact of life.

Nobody could convince me that the Yankee fan in 2001 was more invested than the very same fan five years prior. Sure the miracle late-inning home runs against Byung-hyun Kim were nearly other-worldly and the 9/11 timing upped the ante but pound for pound the first one is always the most revered. The first one always produces the most hysteria.

Imagine a world that witnesses the Jets emerging as Super Bowl champions. After all the suffering the name-calling and laughingstock fallacies that one moment is something incredibly tough to duplicate.

Think back to the Philadelphia Eagles championship a few years ago. Now that’s a party New England Patriots fans couldn’t dare dream of duplicating save for the first Super Bowl stunner against the St. Louis Rams.

Sadly MetLife Stadium New Yankee Stadium and Citi Field don’t offer up the same rabid climate its predecessors did. The conveniences of today’s technologically-driven world have been combined with the pricing out of the diehard fan. Even Madison Square Garden couldn’t dare duplicate the sights and sounds of a John Amirante National Anthem these days.

Our sports world has drastically changed over the last couple of decades. What never changes is the passion that’s brought when the starving fan feeds off hope.

A decade of miserable football the wrong individuals running the show and a league status that leads to misconceptions is what Jets fans have been forced to deal with—all while Eli Manning and the Giants added another Super Bowl to the trophy case.

The hope that surrounds World Tag Team champions Joe Douglas and Robert Saleh has the New York Jets fanbase teed up to perfection. Giants fans are tremendous and steady. They’ve also been a bit spoiled at times and routinely eating well leads to lethargic attitudes.

By the way ask any older Giants fan which Super Bowl is his or her favorite. I bet the majority will label the 1986 team as the winner. And remember the Giants fan went through hell the two decades prior to those 1980s teams leading to an incredible investment on their part.

In the end the New York Jets fan continues to battle his and her way to the adult table at Thanksgiving and once they get there nothing will ever be the same and the investment we currently speak of will need to be revisited.

Yes Robert Saleh is right: The Jets fan the younger character-driven individual who’s enjoyed some highs and plenty of lows all while waiting patiently since 1968 is more invested than the big-brother Giants fan.

They have simply been put through too much crap to turn away now.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Jenny Southan predicts hotel-based nomadic working will be a major travel trend in 2021.

ADVERTISEMENT

Over the last year millions of people across Europe (and beyond) have been working from home. At first it was a novelty but as time has gone on many people have realised that although it’s nice not to have to commute they miss time with their colleagues and need a change of scene.

It’s not always easy to get peace and privacy in at home especially when you have children and frequent video meetings mean you always have to keep your place tidy.

To help solve this problem (and to make extra revenue throughout the travel downturn) hotels have been turning their guest rooms into Covid-secure private offices for remote workers.

From luxury suites to cheap retreats

At the luxury end of the scale having access to a day-use suite can cost a fortune.

For example The Dorchester charges from €1400 for its 'Work Away' package while a junior suite at the Bulgari costs €1590 but includes lunch and post-work drinks. You won’t be able to stay the night though.

At the lower end of the scale for those cautious about using co-working spaces hip European brand 25 Hours charges just €50 a day for its hotel room workspaces while Accor’s “premium remote working experience” is available at 250 UK hotels and 70 in Northern Europe as a single or five-day package.

In the US MGM Resorts has rolled out a “Viva La Office” hotel working package for properties including the Bellagio and Aria with rates from €85 per night (based on a five-night stay).

“These packages are designed to offer the best of both worlds"" explains Atif Rafiq president of commercial and growth for MGM Resorts.

""A safe spacious work setting while still allowing guests to enjoy the amenities and experiences Las Vegas is known for through a single offering.”

The 2007 New England Patriots went 16-0 in the regular season but lost the Super Bowl.

In similar fashion Nevada sportsbooks set an all-time record for football betting handle or amount wagered in 2020. But several Las Vegas oddsmakers don’t expect the books to break the state record for Super Bowl handle on the game between the Chiefs and Buccaneers.

“I’d bet no” William Hill sportsbook director Nick Bogdanovich said. “But if it happened it wouldn’t surprise me.”

Nevada set records for Super Bowl handle in three straight years from 2016 to 2018 topping out at $158.6 million in wagers on Philadelphia’s 41-33 upset of New England.

The handle was $154.7 million last year when Kansas City beat San Francisco 31-20. Six weeks after that game the sports world stopped because of the coronavirus pandemic which is expected to reduce the amount of visitors to Las Vegas for Super Bowl LV and will restrict the number of people at casino parties.

“I don’t think we’ll be near the record because our parties are restricted to 50 people at a time in the room and I don’t think as many people are going to come from out of town” South Point sportsbook director Chris Andrews said. “Part of it’s COVID and part of it’s (legal sports betting) being in other jurisdictions.

“But I’ve got to tell you that (South Point owner) Michael (Gaughan) and (oddsmaker) Jimmy (Vaccaro) both think I’m wrong. They think it’ll be a record or real close.”

Almost three years after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the federal ban on sports betting it’s now legal and offered in 20 states and Washington D.C.

“But Nevada is the king of Super Bowl parties” Bogdanovich said. “Even though they’ll be limited we’ll still get some people here.”

Bogdanovich said early wagering at William Hill seemed slow to him. But betting has been fast and furious at BetMGM which on Thursday took a $2.3 million wager on underdog Tampa Bay (+3½) after taking four six-figure bets on Kansas City totaling $505000.

MGM Resorts director of trading Jeff Stoneback said it’s a continuation of an NFL season-long trend that saw the book take more six-figure bets than usual.

“We always take six-figure bets but this year it’s just been crazy” he said. “I don’t know if that can overcome the decrease of people in town because everybody that comes to town bets the Super Bowl.

“Fifty percent of people bet football when they’re here in October and November but probably 90 percent of people bet it when they’re here on Super Bowl weekend.”

Football betting in Nevada was pandemic-proof in the regular season as the books took $1.9 billion in wagers and won a record $127.7 million on the sport. The handle was boosted by the increased use of mobile apps which accounted for 57.1 percent ($2.5 billion) of the state’s 2020 handle ($4.3 billion).

But because the Super Bowl has become such a major tourist event in Las Vegas Westgate sportsbook vice president Jay Kornegay and director John Murray don’t expect the state to set a record on the game.

“We rely a lot on tourists on our property but we just won’t be able to offer that this year though we do have six different venues set up for 50 people because that’s our max” Kornegay said. “But I would expect some of the other jurisdictions that offer remote sign-ups and full mobile wagering are probably going to put up some pretty good numbers.”

Other states offer remote registration for mobile apps but Nevada still requires in-person sign-ups.

One factor that can only help the handle is the matchup headlined by quarterbacks Tom Brady of the Buccaneers and Patrick Mahomes of the Chiefs.

“The handle will still be through the roof. It’s too good a matchup” Bogdanovich said. “It doesn’t get much better than Brady versus Mahomes.”

Based on the voting Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens players associated with performance enhancing drugs are stuck in place and have diminishing chances of ever gaining admission.

But the Baseball Writers’ Association of America should reconsider another notorious player: Pete Rose.

The debate about whether Rose belongs in the Hall of Fame has been going on since Major League Baseball banned him from the game for life in 1989.

Two years later the Hall of Fame passed a new rule that no player on the MLB lifetime ineligible list could appear on a ballot. The rule was specifically written to punish Rose.

The problem that many fans have is the sanctimony with which the two organizations treat Rose yet willfully dismiss much more egregious cheating charges against PED cheats and an entire MLB team — the 2017 World Series champion Houston Astros.

Rose admitted that he wagered on baseball including the team that he managed the Cincinnati Reds. When the ban was handed down he accepted his fate.

But Rose has petitioned for reinstatement several times including his most recent effort after information became public that electronic sign stealing helped the Astros win the World Series three years ago.

Rose’s lawyer argues that baseball is hypocritical to have what amounts to two sets of rules regarding cheating — one cast iron regulation that applies exclusively to Rose while looking the other way at the Astros and according to indisputable evidence PED abusers like Bonds Clemens Mark McGwire Manny Ramirez and Sammy Sosa who are or have been on HOF ballots.

I’m not a lawyer but I can read and understand English. Under the Federal Anabolic Steroids Control Acts of 1990 the possession distribution or use of steroids without a valid medical prescription is a federal offense punishable by up to five years in prison and/or a $250000 fine.

Although unindicted players suspended for using banned drugs appear to have committed federal felonies.

By comparison in Ohio where Rose placed most of his bets off track gambling is most frequently classified as a misdemeanor. Again I’m not a lawyer but that’s how I interpret the Ohio statutes.

What the Rose case boils down to is that MLB and the HOF are willing to give the Astros and PED criminals a pass but not one of baseball’s all-time greats.

Then-Astros manager A.J. Hinch received a one-year suspension and he’s back piloting the Detroit Tigers. The Boston Red Sox rehired Alex Cora then-Astros coach and identified by insiders as the mastermind of the Astros’ cheating scandal. MLB commissioner Rob Manfred didn’t strip the Astros of their World Series title.

The National League’s 2011 Most Valuable Player Ryan Braun of the Milwaukee Brewers admitted that he used PEDs but he still has his award. In 2015 Dee Strange-Gordon a PED user with the Miami Marlins won the NL batting title; he’s still in the record books.

In November 2018 Manfred added another farcical layer to the Rose affair when MLB announced that MGM Resorts had been officially designated as its “official gaming partner.” Said Manfred: “There’s been a huge change in public opinion on sports gambling.”

Manfred approves of the Washington Nationals permitting a BetMGM sportsbook at Nationals Park this season but his “huge” tent isn’t big enough to include Rose.

Meanwhile Rose approaching 80 remains on the outside looking in. In addition to his 4256 hits record he is the only player in MLB history to play more than 500 games at five different positions.

Rose also played in a record 3562 games and between 1965 and 1985 he was named to the National League All-Star team 17 times.

Rose reasonably asks that his name be placed on the writers’ annual ballot or the Veterans Committee which will convene again during winter 2023. If writers reject him Rose said that he can live with that outcome.

MLB and the HOF are petty and vindictive. Giving Rose a shot at what he deserves would give the two spiteful and bitter institutions a chance to demonstrate dignity and forgiveness.

Foxwoods Resort Casino paid more than $700000 out of its own pocket in order to meet its gaming revenue share obligation with the State of Connecticut.

Guests are Foxwoods Resort Casino walk the gaming floor on June 1 2020. The Connecticut tribal casino won far fewer dollars on its slot machines amid the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. (Image: Greenwich Time)

The Mashantucket Pequot Indian Tribe’s state gaming compact requires Foxwoods to share 25 percent of its slot machine revenue with the state. The minimum payment is $80 million in each fiscal year.

Through six months of the 2021 fiscal year which began July 1 Foxwoods’ gross gaming revenue (GGR) from its slot machines totaled $157.13 million. Its 25 percent tax liability on that figure equates to $39283234.

The tribe’s memorandum of understanding mandates that the least amount the Foxwoods casino can deliver the state every six months is $40 million half of the annual gaming share minimum. The Day newspaper reports that the Mashantucket tribe made up the difference — $716766.

Mohegan Sun owned and operated by the Mohegan Tribe is bound by identical gaming compact terms. Mohegan Sun contributed $57.5 million on more robust slot play at its casino during the six-month period.

Slot Revenue Continues Falling

The days of Mohegan Sun and Foxwoods holding a monopoly on casino gambling in New England are long gone. Today there are casinos in neighboring Massachusetts Rhode Island and upstate New York.

With closer options New Englanders don’t travel to the two Connecticut tribal casinos in the masses that they once did. Slot revenue and the state’s cut have declined as a result.

2006 was the best year on record for Connecticut in terms of gaming tax revenue received. The government collected roughly $433.6 million in slot machine money. In 2020 that figure plummeted to $164.2 million.

Even prior to the pandemic Connecticut was receiving far fewer slot dollars than it once did. The state collected $245.4 million in 2019.

State Considering Gaming Expansion

Despite the 2020 hardships executives at the two Connecticut casinos are optimistic that business will return once the coronavirus is better contained and the vaccine sufficiently distributed.

“Looking beyond the virus we remain positive as our business has been optimized to benefit from what we foresee to be significant pent-up demand for leisure consumption in the months and years ahead” Mohegan Gaming and Entertainment (MGE) said in a filing with the SEC.

Along with visitors returning the tribes could see revenues improve by way of expanded gambling. Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont (D) voiced his support in December for allowing the tribes to conduct sports betting and online casino gambling.

This feels like the stars are aligning” explained Mashantucket Pequot Chair Rodney Butler.

In December the tribes jointly folded on their proposed satellite casino in East Windsor. The gaming project was conceived in order to prevent Connecticut residents in the central and western part of the state from traveling across the border to MGM Resorts’ $960 million casino in Springfield.

Instead of East Windsor the tribes and state lawmakers are now focusing on sports betting and online gaming two things Massachusetts does not have.",,,

He’s one of the most prolific inventors in the world. He holds over 1335 US patents more than the inventor of the electric bulb Thomas Alva Edison (1093 patents). And he was awarded IEEE’s prestigious Andrew S Grove award in 2018 for his contributions to the technology that is used to produce integrated circuits.

Gurtej was born in London to parents specialising in chemistry. The family moved to Punjab when Gurtej was three and that’s where Gurtej grew up. He graduated in electrical engineering from IIT Delhi and then did a PhD in physics from the University of North Carolina.

In December 1990 immediately after his PhD he joined US chipmaker Micron Technology. And that’s where he still is. He is today senior fellow and vice president of advanced process technology responsible for Micron’s R&D roadmaps. He has pioneered several process technologies being currently employed in mainstream semiconductor chip manufacturing. His work has enabled the continuation of Moore’s Law for aggressive scaling of memory chips integral to consumer electronics products and solid-state drives.

Gurtej is convinced it’s all karma. Working on memory chips was the last thing on his mind in his student days. “It was a series of small accidents and decisions that got me here. I felt it was too late for me to get into silicon as it was already a mature industry and during grad school I was working on building a device using diamond as a substrate and that’s what I thought I wanted to do.”

But he ended up applying to Micron. “While browsing through an issue of IEEE Spectrum I found an ad for a job at Micron sent my resume and got selected. I realised later it was a two-year-old issue of the magazine.”

Micron was then a small company. A career in Intel Texas Instruments or IBM was more tempting. But his physics professor who was with IBM before joining academics told him “If you go to a large company they’ll put you in a box.”

So Gurtej went to Micron with a two-year plan. “But I was meant to work with Micron one way or the other because one of the companies that I had got an offer from Texas Instruments decided to exit the memory business which Micron ended up buying” he says.

If you join a big company he says you sort of get lost in the crowd but if you join a smaller company you can learn a lot.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0cmFpdHN0aW1lcy5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvZWNvbm9teS9taWNyb24tdGVjaG5vbG9neS1vbi10cmFjay10by1oaXJlLTE1MDAtaGlnaC1za2lsbGVkLXN0YWZm0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Micron Technology on track to hire 1500 'high-skilled' staff,"SINGAPORE - Semiconductor giant Micron Technology is on track in its hiring of 1500 people in Singapore over the next few years despite the challenges the pandemic has brought.

The computation of deep neural networks (DNNs) is usually abstracted as data flow graphs (DFGs) that consist of operators and the dependency between them. This representation naturally contains two levels of parallelism. The first level is the inter-operator parallelism where operators that do not have dependencies in the DFG may run in parallel. The second level is the intra-operator parallelism where an operator such as matrix multiplication has inherent internal data parallelism and can leverage hardware accelerators that are able to perform parallel computation such as a GPU.

To exploit the two levels of parallelism existing deep learning frameworks (TensorFlow PyTorch MXNet etc.) adopt a two-layered scheduling approach. DFG layer schedulers take the data flow graph and emit operators that are ready to be executed based on the dependencies which takes advantage of the inter-operator parallelism. In addition there is another layer of schedulers that takes the responsibility to exploit the intra-operator parallelism and maps an operator to finer grained execution units in the accelerator. This intra-operator scheduler is often hidden behind opaque libraries such as cuDNN and is sometimes partially implemented in hardware as is the case with GPUs.

While such a two-layer scheduling approach is widely adopted for its simplicity the mutual unawareness of schedulers for inter- and intra-operator parallelism incurs fundamental performance limitations including significant scheduling overhead in runtime ineffective exploitation of inter-operator parallelism and overlooked interactions between these two levels of parallelism.

To overcome these limitations Microsoft Research Asia collaborated with Peking University and ShanghaiTech University to propose Rammer a DNN compiler design that maximizes hardware utilization by holistically exploiting parallelism through inter- and intra-operator co-scheduling. On the workload side Rammer converts every operator of the original DFG to an rOperator and further breaks it up into smaller schedule units called rTasks. On the computational resource side the underlying device is abstracted into a vDevice that consists of a number of virtualized execution units (vEU). With the help of these proposed abstractions Rammer can schedule finer grained rTasks onto several vEUs rather than dispatching an operator to the whole device thereby opening up new optimization space. More importantly the schedule plan is generated at compile time and is “statically” mapped onto the hardware during runtime naturally eliminating most of the schedule overhead.

Although several terminologies found above are borrowed from NVIDIA CUDA it is easy to see from the descriptions so far that the designs of abstraction are hardware neutral. Rammer can be easily customized to mainstream accelerators such as different GPUs IPUs etc. and it has been evaluated on different backends including NVIDIA GPU AMD GPU and GraphCore IPU. Compared with TensorRT a state-of-the-art vendor optimized proprietary DNN inference library from NVIDIA Rammer can achieve an acceleration that is up to 3.1x faster for certain workloads.

The design and implementation of Rammer

Rammer was built atop NNFusion a DNN compiler developed by our team at Microsoft Research Asia. NNFusion can compile a deep learning model into highly optimized source codes (CUDA ROCm etc) targeting different hardware devices. In addition users can import external kernel implementation (e.g. generated by TVM [1]) based on their needs. By doing this NNFusion reduces runtime overhead and removes library/framework dependencies.

Let us first look at what exactly rTasks are. They are independent building blocks of the rOperator and the minimal schedule units. Taking NVIDIA GPU as an example for CUDA kernel implementation each thread block can be converted into an rTask by a light parser. To enable compatibility with the codebase of NNFusion and the prevalent GPU programming model Rammer adopted a source code transformation approach. In other words every rTask can directly apply the original CUDA semantics which couples the rTask with the programming model but also reduces the burden of implementation.

The next question is how to create vDevice and vEU. Currently they can be created and configured based on the parameters of the hardware and a simple heuristic search. For example NVIDIA V100 owns 80 SMs and each SM can at most serve 32 thread blocks concurrently so we can easily create and configure a vDevice consisting of 2560 vEU which matches the physical device.

Now we have the DFG of rTasks and a resource pool filled with vEUs by applying certain naïve policies (such as Round Robin scheduling) which can help to generate an efficient execution plan. Because of the limitations of the hardware and programming model the dispatcher and the scheduler within GPUs are not programmable to the developer. Rammer therefore leverages a technique called “persistent thread” [2] to bind vEUs and SMs and “statically” map the virtual device we have proposed to the physical hardware.

What critical piece of the puzzle does Rammer fill in?

A good piece of work in computer systems should not only help to optimize performance but more importantly clarify the problem itself.

Like many projects the development of Rammer was driven by a specific problem namely how to improve the utilization of GPU for DNN inference. To meet the strict latency constraint small batch sizes are often prevalent in inference engines which usually puts GPUs in an extremely underutilized situation. Besides optimizing the implementation of operators the most straightforward approach to address this issue is to concurrently execute multiple operators on the device which happens to be a familiar problem in the computer architecture community. CUDA introduced the concept stream at a very early stage and there are already a number of effective solutions (concurrent kernel execution [3]，elastic kernel [4]) to this challenge. Why then did researchers ignore the same elephant in the room with DNN serving for such a long time?

As the dependency engine of MXNet mentioned above TensorFlow also tested multi-stream support in its early stage but it was soon deprecated for several reasons:

The CUDA streams deploy a spatial multiplexing scheme to schedule operators from different stream queues during runtime but the units to be scheduled are coarse grained and the intervention between operators could lead to severe performance degradation [5].

The number of streaming processors in a GPU has been drastically increasing in recent years. Nowadays Ampere GA100 is equipped with 128 SMs but in comparison Kepler GK180 GPU from just a few years back is equipped with only 15 SMs. Therefore the preconception that inter-operator parallelism is not critical to performance has been formed in both GPU and DNN framework development communities.

Classic neural network architectures like AlexNet are simple which means the DFG itself will not expose much inter-operator parallelism. However the structures of DNNs are becoming increasingly complex with the rise of AutoML and new design paradigms introduced by research works such as ResNeXt [6] ResNeSt [7].

Taking advantage of inter-operator parallelism is a decent performance optimization method to boost DNN inference but it is far from being systematic. Rammer’s early prototype had already achieved significant acceleration but we felt that we had not grasped the essence of the problem. Was the prototype merely serving as a generalized kernel fusion approach?

Re-clarifying a problem and repositioning our work is not reinventing the wheel as many may believe. We tried to devise the rTask and vEU abstraction and gradually we realized what was behind the problem through rounds of discussions and debates: the performance gap between the compute capacity of hardware and the performance achieved in practices lay in the two-layer scheduling approach adopted by present DNN frameworks. Consequently the new abstractions soon helped us to explore the larger optimization space:

We changed directions from subgraph fusion into workload schedule and resource allocation. Owing to the predictability of the computation pattern (DFG operators and tensors) of DNNs the schedule overhead can be easily offloaded to the compiler which improves the efficiency of searching as well as simplifies the system design.

More importantly the new abstractions revealed to us the interplay of inter- and intra-operator scheduling. Specifically assume that there are two kernel implementations for one operator and one of them consumes three times more resources (e.g. CUDA cores Shared Memory etc) than the other but can only achieve twice the speedup which is quite common in parallel computing. If the whole device is occupied to run a single operator faster implementation would be always preferred since resources are abundant. However to improve the overall performance we showed that the “most cost effective” implementation is usually better than the “fastest” implementation while co-scheduling inter- and intra-operator parallelism. The results challenged a basic assumption in prior works such as AutoTVM [8] on kernel optimization which is that the performance of executing the kernel on a standalone device is the exact criterion to tune a kernel. Evidently “optimal” graph level optimizations such as TASO [9] plus “optimal” high performance kernel implementation do not lead to a global optimal.

Based on the proposed abstraction Rammer with its simple policies can outperform state-of-the-art methods. We envision that the proposed scheduling mechanism will enable future research on more advanced scheduling policies to further explore the optimization space. Future work in this area is highly welcome!

NNFusion has been open sourced on GitHub: https://github.com/microsoft/nnfusion. NNFusion is a flexible and efficient DNN compiler that can generate high-performance executables from a DNN model description. It facilitates full-stack model optimization with ahead-of-time and model-to-code compilation. Latest NNFusion 0.2 is now available: in this release we added new features such as a kernel tuner kernel database and parallel training. A more friendly python interface was also introduced to be compatible with PyTorch.

For those interested please do check out NNFusion. We look forward to receiving any valuable feedback and ideas you may have on how we can continue to squeeze more out of accelerator performance!

In it a man wearing a Google Chrome shirt greedily devours a plate of RAM-shaped cookies while another man in an Adobe Photoshop shirt takes a dainty bite of one then puts the rest back.

It was a damning indictment of Chrome — even if it was missing some important context. For the record Google Chrome really does go to town on your computer’s memory and I had a good laugh along with everyone else. But it also got me thinking: Does Chrome really gobble up more than its fair share of RAM? And if so do other popular Internet browsers take a more conservative approach?

I tested Chrome against Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Edge and my findings were quite interesting. Despite its reputation for being a real RAM hog Chrome did not perform the worst. In fact Chrome was mostly in the middle while Firefox used up the most RAM overall. Microsoft Edge used up the least RAM in every single test.

Chrome vs. Firefox vs. Edge: How I tested

A quick refresher: Random access memory or RAM is a place to store data for short-term processing. Your computer needs RAM to render text images music videos — essentially all the things you find on a website. That's why browsers need a lot of RAM particularly as you open more tabs.

To see how much RAM each browser required I shut down every nonessential program on my PC then booted up one browser at a time. In that browser I opened 10 tabs that might come up in everyday life: Google Tom’s Guide Amazon Netflix Spotify YouTube and so forth. (I also opened up the Corsair homepage since that company inspired this whole experiment.)

I used Guest profiles in Chrome and Edge and a “clean” profile in Firefox in order to prevent extensions or bookmarks from clogging things up. From there all I had to do was monitor memory usage in Windows Task Manager.

The second step was to see how each browser handled massive amounts of data. When a browser has a ton of tabs open rather than try to run each one simultaneously it will often prioritize and optimize data in order to save RAM. This time around I kept the initial 10 tabs then added 10 more from equally demanding sites: eBay Best Buy the New York Times Disney Plus and Google Stadia to name a few.

Next to really tax each browser I opened a whopping 60 tabs in Chrome Firefox and Edge. I opened three copies apiece of each website from the 20-tab test. For the final test I opened up each browser twice and launched 20 tabs in each instance. This replicates a user multitasking — writing in one window and researching in another for example.

Chrome vs. Firefox vs. Edge: RAM usage results

Swipe to scroll horizontally Row 0 - Cell 0 Google Chrome Microsoft Edge Mozilla Firefox 10 tabs 952 MB 873 MB 995 MB 20 tabs 1.8 GB 1.4 GB 1.6 GB 60 tabs 3.7 GB 2.9 GB 3.9 GB 2 instances / 20 tabs apiece 2.8 GB 2.5 GB 3.0 GB

Running 10 tabs took up 952 MB of memory in Chrome while Firefox took up 995 MB. The real surprise however was Edge weighing in at only 873 MB of memory. That Edge made such a great showing is less surprising when you remember that Microsoft’s browser now runs on the same Chromium architecture as Chrome. But to beat Google at its own game is still impressive.

With the 20-tab test Chrome performed the weakest  eating up 1.8 GB RAM compared to Firefox at 1.6 GB and Edge at only 1.4 GB.

Edge continued to perform the best when I loaded 60 tabs in a single browser window taking up 2.9 GB of RAM versus 3.7 GB for Chrome and 3.9 GB for Firefox. The results here were much starker than the 20-tab test as Firefox required a whole extra gig of memory compared to Edge. On the other hand not every user needs 60 tabs open simultaneously so consider whether this use-case might apply to you.

On the final test with 40 tabs open across two instances (20 tabs apiece) Edge required 2.5 GB RAM altogether while Chrome needed 2.8 GB and Firefox needed 3.0 GB. These figures are roughly double what the 20-tab test required which is not terribly surprising — except for Chrome which seems to be a little bit better about optimizing data across two windows.

Chrome vs. Firefox vs. Edge: Observations

(Image credit: Microsoft)

Microsoft has made a big to-do about Edge being a real contender in the Web-browsing space and my results suggest that the company isn’t just blowing smoke. It really is leaner and meaner than either Chrome or Firefox. The difference isn’t night-and-day particularly if your system has a lot of RAM to play with but this could be a big deal for lower-powered PCs — especially lightweight laptops.

It’s important to remember that my tests weren’t highly scientific. RAM usage will vary somewhat depending on your system and will vary tremendously depending on what kind of websites you visit and which extensions you use.

Does this make Edge the “best” Web browser? Not necessarily. A browser should be lightweight sure but it should also load your favorite websites without a hitch run the extensions you want protect you from malware and so forth. This test didn’t evaluate any of those factors so you’ll have to decide for yourself whether it’s worth making the switch.

But if nothing else it’s good to know that Chrome isn’t as bad with RAM as I thought — and that Microsoft Edge beats both Chrome and Firefox.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vc2cubmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vZmluYW5jZS9uZXdzL2dvb2dsZS1leWVzLWF1c3RyYWxpYS1leGl0LW1pY3Jvc29mdC0wNDI0Mzc2MDEuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,As Google eyes Australia exit Microsoft talks Bing with PM,"By Byron Kaye

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Software giant Microsoft Corp is confident its search product Bing can fill the gap in Australia if Google pulls its search over required payments to media outlets Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Monday.

Australia has introduced laws that would force internet giant Google and social media heavyweight Facebook Inc to negotiate payments to domestic media outlets whose content links drive traffic to their platforms.

However the Big Tech firms have called the laws unworkable and said last month they would withdraw key services from Australia if the regulations went ahead. Those services include Google's search engine which has 94% of the country's search market according to industry data.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has since spoken with Morrison about the new rules the tech company told Reuters and on Monday Morrison said the software company was ready to grow the presence of its search tool Bing the distant No. 2 player.

""I can tell you Microsoft's pretty confident when I spoke to Satya"" Morrison told reporters in Canberra without giving further detail of the conversation.

""We just want the rules in the digital world to be the same that exist in the real world in the physical world"" Morrison added.

A Microsoft spokeswoman confirmed the discussion took place but declined to comment because the company was not directly involved in the laws.

""We recognise the importance of a vibrant media sector and public interest journalism in a democracy and we recognise the challenges the media sector has faced over many years through changing business models and consumer preferences"" the spokeswoman said.

Google declined to comment.

A day earlier Australian treasurer Josh Frydenberg said Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg had requested a meeting over the law and that they had talked but that he would not back down on the change.

At a Senate hearing into the laws Department of Treasury deputy secretary of markets Meghan Quinn said the Australian government would have limited ability to intervene if Google's departure hurt businesses which rely on its search function.

""The (media bargaining) code doesn't prevent the wholesale withdrawal of services and there's difficulty in any of the legislative mechanisms we've got for someone to (be forced to) provide a service"" Quinn said.

A leading coronavirus vaccine scientist who helped develop Moderna's highly effective vaccine says Johnson & Johnson's new trial results which tout 72% efficacy for the one-shot vaccine in the US look ""darn good.""

""Don't let the perfect get in the way of the good enough"" Kizzmekia Corbett scientific lead for coronavirus vaccines in the Viral Pathogenesis Laboratory at the National Institutes of Health wrote on Twitter Friday.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

Corbett was instrumental in developing Moderna's new mRNA COVID-19 vaccine which (along with Pfizer's vaccine) is one of two vaccines authorized for emergency use to fight the pandemic in the US.

Both Pfizer and Moderna's shots are impressive vaccines touting efficacies higher than 94% in clinical trials of tens of thousands of people in the US and around the world.

According to a J&J press release out Friday the company's one-shot adenovirus vaccine was 72% effective at curbing symptomatic COVID-19 infections in the US 66% effective globally and 85% effective at preventing severe disease.

""This is darn good for 1-dose ... 'in a pandemic'"" Corbett added.

The new vaccine from J&J is also cheaper easier to manufacture and store and quicker to administer (just one shot) when compared to Pfizer and Moderna's.

Corbett said she's ""feared"" people would be ""spoiled by mRNA"" trial results and that any other vaccine (like J&J's adenovirus vaccine) might be perceived as a ""lesser than"" technology.

J&J's shot she said is ""good enough.""

Indeed US Food and Drug Administration guidance to COVID-19 vaccine makers recommends efficacy ""of at least 50%"" a bar that J&J's new shot easily clears both in the US and around the world.

With new variants circulating quickly it could be another tool to stop deadly infections — even if it may not be as potent as mRNA vaccines at completely halting illnesses.

We also have people who are undocumented and have no other access to care"" said Natalie Hodgen with Ravenswood Health Center. ""We would be OK running out.

reportedly asked the FDA to approve up to five additional doses in each of its vials. The move could increase doses to 15 per vial according to CNBC.

As of Friday evening the US had distributed 49.2 million vaccine doses said the CDC.

Moderna has reportedly sought approval to include up to five extra doses in each vial of its COVID-19 vaccine a move that could speed up distribution.

The company asked the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to allow it to include 15 doses in each vial up from 10 doses according to CNBC.

Moderna didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on Saturday.

Moderna's decision to include more doses per vial would mirror a change made by Pfizer  which asked the FDA to update the wording on its vials to acknowledge they contain six doses not five.

Moderna is among the biggest suppliers to the US government which authorized its vaccine for emergency use in December.

On Wednesday Moderna said it was in talks to sell an additional 100 million doses to the US government. Those doses would be deliverable in the third quarter of 2021 according to the company. It would bring the company's total commitment to the US government to 300 million doses.

President Joe Biden this week said he'd authorized his government to buy an extra 100 million doses of each of the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines. ""Not in hand yet but ordered"" he said.

With those extra doses the total government vaccine order would be about 600 million doses Biden said. His government plans to administer 100 million shots in his first 100 days in office.

As of Friday evening the US had distributed 49.2 million vaccine doses and administered about 27.9 million doses according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

About 22.9 million people had received at least one dose and 4.8 million had received two doses according to the CDC.

At a press briefing on Friday white house press secretary Jen Psaki was asked what affect future FDA approvals including a single-shot vaccine from Johnson & Johnson might have on distribution plans.

Since the S&P 500 bottomed out last March it has gone up more than 70%. Many individual stocks are doing even better with some returning 100% 500% or more than 1000%. Missing out on those kinds of gains can hurt and it unfortunately increases the coppery gleam of risky penny stocks.

Penny stocks typically trade under $5 per share and have very small market capitalizations. Investors believe their dollars stretch further since they can buy more shares. Even going up just a few bucks can lead to big-time returns -- at least that's the thought process.

But penny stocks are vulnerable to pump-and-dump schemes leaving the bag in your unsuspecting hands. You could wait it out but penny stock companies often have poor long-term prospects exacerbating your losses over time.

For these reasons I hope you stay away from most penny stocks. But don't lament your fleeting fortunes: These three stocks can still pad your pockets over the long haul. And they're even penny-themed picks.

eBay: A platform for buying pennies ... and a lot of other things

Online marketplace eBay (EBAY 1.40%) allows users to buy and sell almost anything even rare pennies that sell for thousands of dollars. But the company doesn't provide the merchandise. It simply provides the platform resulting in a stellar 77% gross profit margin. But while that's impressive the company's 183 million active buyers are what truly make this an interesting company.

Many investors overlook eBay because it has reported low growth in recent years. However the company's revenue was boosted by the pandemic: up almost 16% year over year through the first three quarters of 2020. But for some time eBay has been a low-growth company and yet tens of millions continue to peruse its listings a testament to its ongoing top-of-mind brand awareness.

And this intangible asset provides eBay with tangible growth opportunities. For example the company began letting sellers advertise their listings. In the third quarter alone these promoted listings accounted for 7% of total revenue surging 79% year over year.

Moreover the company recently returned to the payments space. In the last few months hundreds of thousands of sellers have started using eBay's managed payments which means investors should start seeing the long-term potential in coming quarters.

And eBay also started a used-merchandise authentication business which it believes will deliver strong growth for years to come.

Because of its strong user base the company has been able to identify these new monetization opportunities. With its stock trading at less than 16 times forward earnings I don't believe the market is pricing in this growth potential. It could take some time to play out but fortunately eBay will pay you a low-yield (but growing) dividend while you wait.

Monster: When penny stocks go right

In rare cases penny stocks can work out well long term as is the case with Monster Beverage (MNST 0.83%). In Jan. 2004 the company had a market cap of just $70 million and a price per share around $0.12. Since then Monster stock is up more than 60000%. Despite concerns from the general public regarding the safety of energy drinks and despite competitors with deeper pockets this beverage company has done nothing but grow sales for 28 consecutive years.

Monster was a rare penny-stock success thanks to a smooth move from management. Before its success the company was called Hansen's Natural an underperforming beverage outfit selling juices and sodas. But management noticed the impressive growth of newcomer Red Bull in the budding energy-drink market and they created Monster to compete. Fortunately Hansen's already had experience in the beverage industry and had distribution agreements in place. These advantages helped Monster at launch and it would go on to take market share.

Listen clearly: I don't expect Monster stock to return 60000% over the next 17 years as it did in the past 17 years but it can still be a steady performer. Here are a few reasons to like it.

First its broad beverage portfolio ensures it can adjust to new trends as they emerge like how Monster's new drink Reign appeals to the growing fitness-energy trend. Second only about 36% of net sales are from outside the U.S. suggesting a long growth runway overseas. And third Monster has zero debt almost $1.7 billion in cash and short-term investments and is currently generating over $1 billion in annual net income giving it an enviably solid financial position.

Square: Earning pennies but creating fortunes

Finally fintech company Square (SQ -2.62%) turned a profit in the third quarter of 2020 -- a whole seven pennies per diluted share -- but don't let those meager profits fool you. The company is spending heavily on product development and sales and marketing in an effort to disrupt the entire financial industry.

There are two major sides to Square's business. The first is the Cash App: fintech solutions for individuals. As cash took a backseat during the pandemic this business soared. Cash App revenue was up 574% in the third quarter alone. However a lot of this was growth was driven by things that don't carry good profit margins. That said high-margin subscription and service-based revenue was still up an impressive 154% year over year for Cash App in the third quarter.

The other side of Square's business is the seller side which has struggled during the COVID-19 pandemic. Through the first three quarters of 2020 seller segment revenue was up less than 1% year over year. It's understandable -- many of the small and medium-size businesses Square serves were disproportionately affected by the coronavirus. But this might be an opportunity for 2021 as life returns to normal. Square played a big role in helping businesses endure. For example its services help brick-and-mortar stores merge in-store inventory with an online presence. I'm betting business owners increasingly see that it pays to be prepared with services like those offered by Square.

As the business grows it will keep plowing cash into new ancillary opportunities. For example the company is rumored to be interested in acquiring music-streaming company Tidal. Therefore expect pennies on the bottom line for the foreseeable future while it pursues any opportunity it can to grow its overall business.

Conclusion

The point is you don't need to plow hard-earned cash into sketchy businesses with uncertain prospects. eBay Monster and Square are all safer bets than most penny stocks. And they can beat the market average over the long haul.

That last point is important because you don't need exponential gains to create long-term wealth. Simply beating market returns over the course of decades with safe stocks like these will get you there.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Announcement:

Moody’s says Acrisure’s ratings remain unchanged

following announcement of term loan add-on

25 January 2021

Company adding $700 million to existing senior secured term loan raising total outstanding term

loan to $3.9 billion

New York January 25 2021 – Moody's Investors Service says the B3 corporate family rating and

B3-PD probability of default rating on Acrisure LLC (Acrisure) remain unchanged following the

company’s announcement that it plans to borrow an additional $700 million under its senior secured

term loan (rated B2). The company intends to use net proceeds from the offering to refinance

existing secured debt fund future acquisitions and pay related fees and expenses. The rating

outlook for Acrisure is unchanged at stable.

RATINGS RATIONALE

Acrisure's ratings reflect its growing market presence in US insurance brokerage and select

international markets its good mix of business across property & casualty insurance and employee

benefits and its healthy EBITDA margins. Acrisure maintains the existing brands of its many

acquired entities and allows them to operate fairly autonomously while centralizing critical financial

reporting and compliance functions. Acrisure aligns the interests of its existing and acquired

businesses by including significant common equity in its purchase consideration. While GSO/

Blackstone holds a majority of Acrisure’s preferred equity Acrisure Management and Agency

Partners own more than 90% of the firm's common equity.

These strengths are offset by Acrisure's large number and dollar volume of acquisitions and its rising

debt burden. The acquisition strategy heightens the firm's integration risk and its exposure to errors

and omissions in the delivery of professional services. The acquisitions also give rise to contingent

earnout liabilities that consume a substantial portion of Acrisure's free cash flow.

Acrisure’s performance is holding up relatively well through the coronavirus-related economic

slowdown with revenues of $1.4 billion for the first nine months of 2020 and strong EBITDA margins

helped by expense savings. The company’s organic growth was slightly negative for the first nine

months of 2020 while retention rates remained solid. Moody’s expects that Acrisure will continue to

limit its discretionary spending to maintain its credit profile as the economy recovers.

Giving effect to the proposed borrowing Acrisure will have a pro forma debt-to-EBITDA ratio at or

slightly above 7.5x and (EBITDA - capex) interest coverage in the range of 1.5x-2x per Moody's

Story continues

estimates. The company is improving its cash flow generation and produced positive free cash flow

after contingent earnout payments and scheduled debt amortization during the first nine months of

2020. These metrics incorporate the rating agency's adjustments for operating leases contingent

earnout liabilities changes in a warrant liability and run-rate earnings from recent and pending

acquisitions. Moody's expects Acrisure to reduce its financial leverage over the next couple of years

in line with provisions it has agreed to with its preferred equity holders and to continue generating

positive free cash flow after earnout payments and debt amortization.

Factors that could lead to a rating upgrade include: (i) debt-to-EBITDA ratio below 6x; (ii) (EBITDA

- capex) coverage of interest exceeding 2x; (iii) free-cash-flow-to-debt ratio exceeding 5%; and (iv)

declining proportion of revenue and earnings from newly acquired versus existing business.

Factors that could lead to a rating downgrade include: (i) debt-to-EBITDA ratio above 7.5x; (ii)

(EBITDA - capex) coverage of interest below 1.2x; (iii) free-cash-flow-to-debt ratio below 2% or

negative free cash flow after contingent earnout payments and scheduled debt amortization; or (iv)

disruptions to existing or newly acquired operations.

It has appointed Morgan Stanley as banker Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co as legal advisor and KPMG as financial and tax advisor the firm said in an analyst presentation.

Deliberations are on regarding the proposed Reit's corporate and capital structure as well as asset perimeters the firm said.

DLF Cyber City Developers Ltd (DCCDL) a joint venture between DLF and Singapore's sovereign wealth fund GIC Pte Ltd owns and operates a 35 million sq ft ready rental portfolio of which around 3 million sq ft is retail space and the rest is office.

“The first set of bankers and tax advisors has been hired as we prepare for a Reit-ready portfolio in the next 12 months. However the timing of the listing will depend on the two shareholders"" Sriram Khattar managing director of DLF Rental Business said in an analyst call on Saturday evening.

Canada’s Brookfield Asset Management-backed Brookfield India Real Estate Trust plans to raise ₹3800 crore through a public issue of its Reit in the coming week. The issue is priced between ₹274 and ₹275 and opens for subscription on 3 February and closes on 5 February.

Property consultants believe given the positive investor sentiment in India’s commercial office sector DLF’s REIT could be a game-changer due to its sheer size and quality of assets.

Embassy REIT’s (33.3 million sq ft) listing in 2019 and the Mindspace Business Parks REIT (29.5 million sq ft) listing amid the pandemic both backed by Blackstone Group Lp as majority and minority shareholder respectively have given investors huge confidence in the office sector.

DLF in a regulatory filing on Friday said it has posted a 9% rise in quarterly net profit helped by a continuing recovery in demand in the residential segment.

Profit in the three months ended 31 December rose to ₹449 crore from ₹413.10 crore a year earlier. Revenue grew 9% to ₹1668.22 crore from ₹1533.34 crore.

The firm also said that Rajeev Talwar its chief executive since 2015 has decided to retire after a long association with the company.

Hedge funds and other institutions shorting GameStop stock were sitting on losses of about $19 billion as of Friday new data shared exclusively with Insider indicates.

Figures from the data provider Ortex suggested that investors who had bet that the share price would fall had been massively squeezed with losses topping $10 billion on Wednesday alone when GameStop soared 135%.

Members of the Reddit forum Wall Street Bets have gone to war with hedge funds such as Melvin Capital this week over the US video-game retailer.

Forum members banded together to help drive up GameStop stock by more than 1500% over the past month with seemingly little business basis.

The rise has dramatically ""squeezed"" investors who were betting that the price would fall. As the price has soared short-sellers have been forced to ""cover"" their positions by buying back stock at a huge loss.

""The long and the short of it hedge funds are hurting"" said Eleanor Creagh a market strategist at Saxo Bank adding that ""the problem from here"" is ""whether the initial bout of deleveraging causes a chain reaction of squeezed positioning.""

When the GameStop stock price soared on Wednesday investors' losses on paper rose by about $10.2 billion Ortex's data showed. But as the price tumbled on Thursday short-sellers regained some ground with estimated gains of $5.95 billion.

Overall Ortex estimated that short-sellers were on track for losses of about $19.04 billion as of Friday with GameStop's share price up by 78% to about $345 just before 11 a.m. ET.

The losses haven't been realized — they're estimates based on data provided by lenders brokers and dealers. But they give a sense of the scale of the hit to hedge funds and other short-sellers.

Melvin Capital and Citron Research both said this week that they had closed their short positions but they did not disclose any losses incurred.

Ortex estimated that the number of GameStop shares being shorted had fallen from about 79000 on January 13 to fewer than 39000 as of Thursday.

Steve Cohen's $19 billion hedge fund Point72 has lost nearly 15% this year during the GameStop frenzy a source told The New York Times. And Bloomberg reported that $20 billion D1 Capital Partners had lost about 20% in January.

Data from Ortex released on Thursday indicated that short-sellers were sitting on losses of about $70 billion because of their overall short positions on US firms so far this month.

The company has upset the applecart of US stock investing by waiving the commission that traditional brokers charge customers to play the markets. That plus its user-friendly app has made trading much cheaper and easier for ordinary people regardless of their experience enticing more than 13 million users at the last count.

Its name is a nod to the idea of helping the “poor” gatecrash the glamorous domain of rich traders and it likes to style itself as drawing on the ethos of the Occupy Wall Street movement. In the words of its official rubric Robinhood is “democratizing finance for all”.

But this romanticised vision sits rather uncomfortably beside the reality of its origins and ownership.

The app was founded in 2013 by Stanford University graduates and financial technology whiz-kids Baiju Bhatt and Vladimir Tenev. In a few short years they have become paper billionaires building the business into a steamroller success worth $8.6bn (£6.9bn) according to a recent funding round.

Given that Robinhood doesn’t charge commission from its users it has to make money some other way. It does that by charging fees to financial services companies which pay for a steady stream of orders for trades made by the app’s users.

While Robinhood facilitates the trades it goes to “market maker” firms – typically large banks and financial institutions – who actually execute the transactions that keep the stock market moving. They profit by pocketing the difference – the “spread” – between the price people are willing to pay for stock and the price at which they’re willing to sell.

JP Morgan Goldman Sachs Morgan Stanley and Barclays are hardly what you’d think of as the prince of thieves’s merry men

This funding model has raised questions about whether Robinhood is really worthy of the name. Is it looking out for its users or for the same Wall Street investors it claims to help them bypass?

One of the market makers that pays Robinhood for this “deal flow” is Citadel Securities whose automated exchanges process 39% of all US listed share trades by volume. It was founded by the Wall Street tycoon Ken Griffin whose stable also includes the Rumours reached fever pitch when Citadel LLC helped bail out Melvin Capital a fellow hedge fund that Robinhood users were trying to punish for shorting GameStop.

Citadel has denied that it put any pressure on Robinhood to suspend trading in GameStop and other firms in response to a burgeoning belief that Wall Street had flexed its financial muscles to thwart a rebellion that was costing it money. That belief only gained strength when critics pointed out the hedge-fund contingent among Robinhood’s own backers. Sequoia Capital a big beast of venture capital that led a $280m fundraising effort valuing Robinhood at $8.3bn in May 2020 has denied applying pressure.

There may be no evidence behind the rumours but if anyone were under any illusion about Robinhood’s links to high finance they need only look at the names that helped it raise $1bn last week to help shore up its finances. JP Morgan Goldman Sachs Morgan Stanley and Barclays are hardly what you’d think of as the prince of thieves’s merry men.

There are other reasons to be cautious about Robinhood’s model: making trading easier has exposed people with little knowledge of finance to information they often don’t understand.

On 12 June last year a 20-year-old student Alex Kearns killed himself believing that he had just lost $730000 (£580000) on Robinhood. The sum was actually a temporary position on an option – the kind of financial instrument that Robinhood users have been using to buy in to GameStop. When he died he was actually $16000 in the red.

In a statement Tenev and Bhatt said they had been “personally devastated by this tragedy” and Robinhood promised to review the products that users were able to trade and give them more information about what they were doing. But it came under intense pressure from US politicians and eventually cancelled its UK launch planned for last summer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzhjYWEzYzc1LTk0NGEtNDY4ZS04YTY4LTlkZWVlYzhiNjdkONIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GameStop mania: why Reddit traders are unlikely to face prosecution,"Try unlimited access Only MX$100 for 4 weeks

The chart above illustrates how dynamically holding growth and mega caps (the “anti-factors” to value and small size) was preferred over their factor complements in recent years due to their relative dominance in disruptive innovation alongside robust profitability. We can maintain a well-balanced portfolio by also holding positions in momentum quality and minimum volatility to capture exposure to historically rewarded factors.

Expanding the opportunity set in dynamic factor frameworks to include other investment styles or “anti-factors” during periods of cyclical strength has the potential to unlock additional benefits for portfolios and can help mitigate short-term weakness in traditional factors while still maintaining diversification.

Factors with themes

Themes like the predominant work-from-home influences that occurred in 2020 are transitory but they interact with factors in significant ways. Over 2020 much of the US workforce went into work-from-home and many in-person work and leisure activities were curtailed. Value suffered as social distancing themes went into effect—because often value stocks were overweight business models that needed a physical presence like foot traffic in a store or in-person office interactions to generate business. Many growth companies particularly tech services firms with dominant market positions benefited from the rise of connectivity technology. Social distancing also benefited large stocks with large financial cushions. During the worst months of February and March minimum volatility outperformed the market by 4-6%.2

But the pattern for minimum volatility reversed as the economy gradually re-opened over the last half of 2020. From the bottom of the market in late March the market shot up powered by large growth stocks like the FAANGMs (Facebook Apple Amazon Netflix Google or Alphabet and Microsoft) and tech services firms that benefit most from the social distancing and work from home environment of 2020. As market participants’ risk aversion decreased strategies that minimized risk like minimum volatility strategies tended to lag. On the other hand despite their overall disappointing performance in 2020 value and size outperformed the market in Q4 by 5.4% and 5.9% respectively as the economy reopened and in person business resumed.3 The toggling between social-distance themes benefiting growth stocks and economic reopening benefiting value and size over the course of the global pandemic is more fully illustrated in the chart below.

By Wayne Cole

SYDNEY Feb 1 (Reuters) - Asian shares wavered on Monday amid worries that problems with vaccine rollouts combined with new strains of COVID-19 will delay a global economic recovery that has already been baked into the market's rich valuations.

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.4% following four straight sessions of losses. Japan's Nikkei bounced 0.4% after shedding almost 2% on Friday.

Futures for the S&P 500 lost another 0.7% in heavy trade while NASDAQ futures fell 0.9%.

Dealers were also warily awaiting new developments in the headline-grabbing battle between retail investors and funds that specialise in shorting stocks.

U.S. hedge funds bought and sold the most stock in more than 10 years amid wild swings in GameStop Corp according to an analysis by Goldman Sachs Inc.

Talk on Monday was that silver was the new target for the retail crowd as the metal jumped 5.7% to a six-month high .

Yet many analysts see this entertaining episode as a sideshow compared to signs of a loss of momentum in the United States and Europe as coronavirus lockdowns bite.

Indeed a survey from China on Sunday showed factory activity grew at the slowest pace in five months in January as restrictions took a toll in some regions.

Neither was the news on vaccine rollouts positive especially given doubts about whether they will work on new COVID strains.

""It is these considerations not what is happening to a video gamer retailer day to day that has weighed on risk assets"" said John Briggs global head of strategy at NatWest Markets. ""So much of the market's valuations risk in particular is premised on the fact we can see a light at the end of the COVID tunnel.""

Doubts have also emerged about the future of President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion relief package with 10 Republican senators urging a $600 billion plan.

The jitters in stocks caused only a brief ripple in bonds with Treasury yields actually rising late last week perhaps a refection of the tidal wave of borrowing underway.

A record $1.11 trillion of gross Treasury issuance is slated for this quarter up from $685 billion the same time last year.

Early Monday U.S. 10-year yields held at 1.07% and near the recent 10-month top of 1.187%.

Higher yields combined with the more cautious market mood have seen the safe-haven dollar steady above its recent lows. The dollar index stood at 90.628 having bounced from a trough of 89.206 hit early in January.

The euro idled at $1.2121 well off its recent peak at $1.2349 while the dollar held firm at 104.74 yen.

Gold followed silver higher to $1853 an ounce but has repeatedly stalled at resistance around $1875.

Global demand concerns kept oil prices in check. U.S. crude eased 30 cents to $51.90 a barrel while Brent crude futures dropped 20 cents to $54.84.

Its stock rose 570% more than Zoom Moderna and just about every other growth stock other than Tesla. Enphase is now the largest publicly traded pure-play U.S. solar stock by market capitalization.

Enphase has some impeccable growth prospects and a leading position in a booming industry. But there are a number of reasons why its stock may have ran too far too fast in 2020. Here's why Enphase Energy is a great company but its stock is too expensive right now.

The turnaround

If you were an investor scanning the market for solar stocks in the summer of 2017 you probably wouldn't have noticed the less than $75 million gem that was Enphase Energy. The company that had once been valued at over half a billion dollars and sold for $15 a share was now trading for less than $1 a share. On the brink of bankruptcy and losing market share to rival SolarEdge (NASDAQ: SEDG) Enphase then restructured and went on to have one of the better four-year comebacks on Wall Street. Trading at over $200 a share today you won't find many companies that have produced an over 200-fold return faster than Enphase.

Excellent growth

Enphase's epic surge is due in part to its growth numbers -- which have been impressive. The company doubled revenue between 2018 and 2019. The results aren't out yet but Enphase is guiding for revenue between $245 million and $260 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 which would bring total 2020 revenue to around $762 million (a 22% gain over 2019). Aside from revenue the company is now consistently reporting profitable quarters on a non-GAAP basis growing its operating cash flow and sporting the highest gross margin in its history. At 53% its GAAP gross margin is closer to leading chip manufacturers like NVIDIA or AMD than it is to other solar companies.

Concerning valuation

Just like Enphase's gross margin resembles leading chip manufacturers its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio resembles that of trendy electric vehicle stocks like Tesla and Nio.

Enphase's staggering 38 P/S ratio is about the only chart you need to take a pass on this stock at its current price. It is nearly quadruple the 10.6 P/S ratio of its rival SolarEdge. And it's higher than Nio and Tesla which surged over 1100% and 740% in 2020 respectively.

The P/S ratio is the market capitalization of a stock divided by its revenue. Put another way imagine if you had a coffee shop that earned $100000 a year in revenue and the market valued your business at $3.8 million even though you're barely turning a profit. That's how much the market is valuing Enphase's growth so much so that it's willing to pay a premium price today because it believes in the future of the company.

But it's not just the high P/S ratio on its own that makes Enphase an expensive stock. It's also the fact that Enphase isn't growing revenue at the same pace it did in 2019. Comparing Enphase to other hyper-growth stocks like CrowdStrike or Zoom further outlines Enphase's lofty valuation. Although CrowdStrike and Zoom both have a higher P/S ratio than Enphase (61 and 59 respectively) they are growing revenue much faster than Enphase.

CrowdStrike is expected to double its revenue (again) in Fiscal Year 2021 whereas Zoom's P/S ratio is misleading because it factors in the company's first-half 2020 revenues which are a fraction of what it's earning today.

A league of its own

Enphase has found itself in uncharted territory (literally). Its valuation is multiples higher than that of other leading solar companies. Although it has one of the highest growth rates and gross margins in the sector 2020 revenue is expected to grow by just 22% year over year. 2021 will need to generate much higher revenue growth or Enphase's share price will need to come down before the company is worth considering. And there are other concerns as well. Enphase has picked up its profitability but it technically lost money in the second quarter of 2020. It is also compensating its employees with a fair amount of stock-based compensation which isn't shown in the non-GAAP numbers it tends to quote.

Enphase is a great company but an expensive stock. There are plenty of better solar stocks and wind stocks at more attractive valuations.

This philosophy has helped her become an early market entrant who continues to serve as a leader in the cannabis space.

In 2019 her company MJ Freeway merged with special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) MTech Acquisition Corp. The merger created the brand Akerna which now trades on the Nasdaq under the KERN symbol. Billingsley was named CEO upon the deal's completion making Akerna the first woman-led cannabis tech company to trade on the Nasdaq.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

Since going public some of Akerna's strategic acquisitions include the purchase of cultivation compliance brand Trellis in April 2020 and Canadian seed-to-sale platform Ample Organics in July. To date Akerna has an established presence in 14 countries offering six products across the supply chain. In November 2020 the company reported year-over-year software revenue growth of 40%.

Billingsley's initial foray into cannabis began in 2008. Then heading up a tech services firm she was invited to invest in one of Colorado's first licensed operators. Deeming the venture to be worthwhile Billingsley invested.

However it was a family member suffering from a demyelinating illness (a condition that results in damage to the protective covering or myelin sheath that surrounds nerve fibers in your brain optic nerves and spinal cord) that served as the primary driver for the move. She saw promising medical reports backing marijuana's potential in treating those like her family member. Her interest in the market only grew that first year and she said she credits meetings with prominent figures like cannabis activist and entrepreneur Montel Williams as early influential moments.

""Interestingly many many many people who got started very early on had some health and/or wellness reason for pursuing cannabis"" Billingsley said.

Kickstarting the seed-to-sale tracking sector

A year of investing prompted Billingsley to dive deeper into the cannabis space. She noted that several crucial data points in the industry's supply chain went untracked — specifically the plant's genetic makeup leaving information gaps across the marketplace.

Seeking to provide a comprehensive analysis of the plant Billingsley launched MJ Freeway in 2010 providing tracking from cultivation to sale. The company's creation lit a fire under the now booming seed-to-sale tracking sector — which now boasts a bevy of industry players including Flowhub Viridian Sciences BioTrack and Canix the winner of the 2020 TechCrunch Startup Battlefield competition.

The compliance software company grew with an eye on marijuana's future. Continued innovation and evolution brought about rapid growth during the initial years including a 205% growth rate between 2012 and 2015. The company generated $2.5 million in revenue during the same period. In 2015 the company capped the year off by closing an $8 million series B fundraising round. Led by prominent American investor Roger McNamee the round funded the development of MJ Freeway's enterprise B2B business product MJ Platform.

Knowing the cannabis space would want enterprise resource planning (ERP) software just like any other market allowed the company to think beyond its early stages.

""Even at the time we saw the coming future — that cannabis would scale cannabis would begin to truly span different markets jurisdictions governments with different compliance requirements and ultimately international currency conversion"" Billingsley said.

Going public

Several more years of growth led Billingsley and MJ Freeway to a point no woman had yet been in cannabis: listing on the Nasdaq.

The deal's completion was no easy task with the companies dedicating over six months of additional time to address any potential legal hurdles they might encounter. Part of the process included documenting any small decision the company made knowing that a cannabis brand would be under more scrutiny than other markets.

The decision paid off as Akerna eventually received its approval — something Billingsley wasn't assured using other public listing methods. ""If we had attempted an IPO or an uplist or something along those lines it is possible just to be ignored forever"" she said.

Making history wasn't the direct goal when starting out she added. That said an exit was always an ultimate purpose. Going public ultimately presented itself first which allowed the company to conduct ""strategic M&A"" Billingsley said and once again look toward the future this time focusing on the global market while preparing for an eventual end to conflicting US federal and state cannabis laws. Billingsley said the goal is to ""firmly position us as the only scale technology provider.""

Promoting women in tech and cannabis

Billingsley recalled that she often was the only woman in the room in the early days. Since then things haven't changed all that much for women in cannabis or tech.

Akerna's One Woman Challenge launched by Billingsley in 2018 to promote inclusive hiring and keep women in tech roles beyond their mid-career believes that supporting women doesn't always have to be on a grand scale. Leaders of business of any gender are encouraged to get involved through small but significant efforts which can include getting coffee to discuss work or setting more dedicated meeting times with interested individuals each month — practices Billingsley continues today. She reported that of Akerna's five executive team members two are women and one is a person of color.

While she believes that inclusion is the right thing to do for equality Billingsley suggested highlighting ROI when advocating with business leaders. ""By every measure diversity is good for business"" she said.

Remaining centered and creative in an increasingly demanding space

Billingsley doesn't believe in work-life balance joking that colleagues would say she works all the time. However she does see the value in having time spent away from work.

""I don't know about you but I have never once gotten my best idea during a whiteboard session"" Billingsley said adding that her best ideas tend to come after rock climbing yoga or even a shower.

She credits the approach to her mother a professor of nursing with a particular interest in consciousness. She recalled her mother's lifelong advice to think of a problem before sleeping so that her subconscious could come up with a solution overnight.

""It's amazing how true that can be"" Billingsley said. She added ""I think we need time away from work and we need to acknowledge that work is not only in the office.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAyMS8wMS8zMS90b290c2llLXJvbGwtY2VvLWVsbGVuLWdvcmRvbi10ci1zdG9jay1zaGFyZXMtZ2FtZXN0b3Av0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Meet the 89-year old billionaire CEO behind one of this year's wildest stocks: Tootsie Roll,"In her 53 years running sweets maker Tootsie Roll Industries CEO Ellen Gordon has seen a lot of things. But one thing she hadn’t before this week was her company’s stock getting swept up in stock market madness as day traders feuded with hedge funds.

While GameStop and AMC Entertainment were the headline grabbers Tootsie Roll was briefly pulled along by retail traders swapping tips on a Reddit board r/WallStreetBets. Tootsie Roll’s stock had been minding its own business last week trading steadily around the $30 mark and then the stock exploded in the following days almost doubling to an all-time high of $58.98 on Wednesday before giving some of that gain back. And all that on no news at all (Tootsie Roll’s sales declines caused by the pandemic had long been known).

At one point this week the stock moves made Tootsie Roll worth more than $4 billion. And in turn it made Gordon who became CEO in 2015 at the age of 83 when she replaced her deceased husband a multibillionaire with her 55% stake according to Bloomberg Data worth $2.2 billion. Not bad for a company taking in about $500 million a year in sales.

The media-shy Gordon who eschews the quarterly conference calls with Wall Street analysts customary for public companies has not yet responded to a request for an interview from Fortune.

Deeply ingrained in American culture the candy maker’s namesake product was invented in New York in 1896 from a recipe concocted by Austrian immigrant Leo Hirschfield and named after his daughter’s nickname. (The Tootsie Pop came in 1931.)

Before this week many hasn’t realized Tootsie Rolls was even a standalone company listed on the stock market. Yet indeed it is. Tootsie Roll made its New York Stock Exchange debut in 1922.

For Gordon née Rubin in 1932 becoming CEO was not simply a matter of a wife inheriting a company from her husband. On the contrary Ellen and her family were involved with Tootsie Roll long before she ever met him: The Rubins bought shares in the company the year it went public and by the time Ellen was a tot they were majority shareholders with her father eventually becoming president of Sweets Co of America as the company was known at the time.

Ellen and Melvin who married in 1950 later inherited the company and eventually started running it as equals from the get-go. After her studies which included a graduate degree from Harvard University she began working at Tootsie Roll in 1968 in pension planning and product development showing a knack for the latter. By 1978 she was president and chief operating officer while her husband 12 years her senior was CEO. (When he died 2015 at 95 he was the oldest CEO of any company listed on either the NYSE or Nasdaq.)

At most companies her president title would have suggested she was the company’s No. 2. But the couple were equals in running the company. And she was certainly a trailblazer: she was only the second woman president of a NYSE-listed company ever.

Together they navigated the eat-or-be-eaten world of confectionary M&A that saw mega deals like Mars buy William Wrigley and Kraft Foods buy Cadbury in the late aughts. Instead Tootsie Roll despite its small size and allure as a potential target and determined to stay independent was an acquirer over the years buying brands like Junior Mints and DOTS.

Upon her husband’s death Ellen Gordon became CEO and according to Chicago newspapers has continued to run the company focused on safeguarding what has made Tootsie Rolls dear to many consumers.

“It’s basically the same Tootsie Roll all these years” she told the Chicago Tribune in 1996. “People like to give it to their children pass on the candy and the memories that go with it from one generation to the next.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9hYmlvbWVkLWluYy1qdXN0LXJlY29yZGVkLTIwLTA2MDQwNTAyOC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Abiomed Inc. Just Recorded A 20% EPS Beat: Here's What Analysts Are Forecasting Next,"Abiomed Inc. (NASDAQ:ABMD) just released its quarterly report and things are looking bullish. It was overall a positive result with revenues beating expectations by 2.4% to hit US$232m. Abiomed also reported a statutory profit of US$1.35 which was an impressive 20% above what the analysts had forecast. Following the result the analysts have updated their earnings model and it would be good to know whether they think there's been a strong change in the company's prospects or if it's business as usual. We thought readers would find it interesting to see the analysts latest (statutory) post-earnings forecasts for next year.

View our latest analysis for Abiomed

Taking into account the latest results the consensus forecast from Abiomed's nine analysts is for revenues of US$998.1m in 2022 which would reflect a major 23% improvement in sales compared to the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to accumulate 7.4% to US$4.78. In the lead-up to this report the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$1.00b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$4.96 in 2022. So it looks like there's been a small decline in overall sentiment after the recent results - there's been no major change to revenue estimates but the analysts did make a minor downgrade to their earnings per share forecasts.

Despite cutting their earnings forecaststhe analysts have lifted their price target 16% to US$378 suggesting that these impacts are not expected to weigh on the stock's value in the long term. That's not the only conclusion we can draw from this data however as some investors also like to consider the spread in estimates when evaluating analyst price targets. There are some variant perceptions on Abiomed with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$425 and the most bearish at US$245 per share. This shows there is still a bit of diversity in estimates but analysts don't appear to be totally split on the stock as though it might be a success or failure situation.

One way to get more context on these forecasts is to look at how they compare to both past performance and how other companies in the same industry are performing. We can infer from the latest estimates that forecasts expect a continuation of Abiomed'shistorical trends as next year's 23% revenue growth is roughly in line with 19% annual revenue growth over the past five years. By contrast our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in a similar industry are forecast to see their revenues grow 9.3% per year. So although Abiomed is expected to maintain its revenue growth rate it's definitely expected to grow faster than the wider industry.

Story continues

The Bottom Line

The most important thing to take away is that the analysts downgraded their earnings per share estimates showing that there has been a clear decline in sentiment following these results. Fortunately they also reconfirmed their revenue numbers suggesting sales are tracking in line with expectations - and our data suggests that revenues are expected to grow faster than the wider industry. There was also a nice increase in the price target with the analysts clearly feeling that the intrinsic value of the business is improving.

With that said the long-term trajectory of the company's earnings is a lot more important than next year. We have estimates - from multiple Abiomed analysts - going out to 2025 and you can see them free on our platform here.

That said it's still necessary to consider the ever-present spectre of investment risk. We've identified 1 warning sign with Abiomed  and understanding it should be part of your investment process.

Despite a cult following and intense brand loyalty Tesla has been unable to wring any profits out of the half a million cars it now sells annually.

To be clear Tesla did report a profit for 2020 under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) marking the company's first full year of profitability. But that profit did not come from the core business of manufacturing cars. Tesla booked a whopping $1.58 billion of revenue from selling regulatory credits last year more than the previous three years combined. Tesla's net income of $721 million in 2020 turns into a substantial loss if those regulatory credit sales are backed out.

A regulatory bonanza

Certain U.S. states award regulatory credits to automakers for selling electric vehicles. Automakers must acquire a minimum number of these credits to comply with regulatory requirements. These credits can be bought and sold so an automaker that doesn't sell enough electric vehicles can buy credits from other automakers that do.

This regulatory credit system is an attempt by governments to encourage electric vehicle production and reduce emissions. It's ended up essentially subsidizing Tesla's money-losing car operation. Since Tesla only produces electric cars it's able to sell reams of credits to other automakers that are unwilling or unable to produce enough electric cars.

It should be obvious that this situation is not going to last forever. Automakers are aggressively ramping up their electric vehicle efforts and there's little reason to believe that Tesla has any real advantage beyond its brand. One example: General Motors is pouring billions into its electric vehicle efforts with plans for dozens of models over the next few years. GM also recently unveiled a new commercial electric vehicle brand and it already has delivery giant FedEx as a customer.

This regulatory credit windfall for Tesla will start to vanish as other automakers ramp up their electric vehicle sales. Tesla will then need to figure out how to profitably manufacture cars.

An extreme valuation

Tesla's valuation of more than $800 billion is quadruple that of Toyota. Toyota sold nearly 10 million cars in 2020 compared to half a million for Tesla.

I would argue that it probably won't matter how well Tesla does over the coming years because the valuation is so extreme that a positive result for investors would require absolutely everything to go right. The company can do well even very well and the stock could still fall apart.

Here's an example from the dot-com bubble. Cisco Systems stock hit an all-time high around $80 in early 2000. The networking hardware company was valued at nearly $550 billion at its peak.

Today Cisco is the dominant provider of enterprise networking hardware. The company's share of the enterprise switch market hovers around 50% despite no shortage of low-cost competition. Cisco's revenue has soared from about $19 billion in 2000 to nearly $50 billion today. Net income has shot up from $2.7 billion to over $11 billion. Cisco the company has been an unquestionable success story.

Cisco the stock on the other hand has been an unmitigated disaster. If you bought Cisco stock at its peak you're down over 40% more than 20 years later. The company is worth around $200 billion today. You were right about the company but very wrong about the stock.

Tesla the company doing well in the long run does not in any way guarantee that Tesla the stock does well. You can be right about Tesla becoming a top automaker and still lose your shirt investing in the stock. Even if Tesla does wean itself off regulatory credits and starts manufacturing millions of cars annually at a profit the valuation is so deep into the stratosphere that it may not even matter.

Due to the months we’ve spent in lockdown and taking online classes in 2020 one can only assume that that number has increased. On top of the hours we spend on the computer watching lectures and working on assignments with apps like Netflix TikTok and Instagram we consume so much additional online content. Spending excessive amounts of time in front of a screen is not good for our eyes or our mental health.

So what’s the solution? I may sound like a grandma here but it’s the truth: Read a book! Reading physically gives you the chance to turn off your phone for a bit and distance yourself from constant distractions like scrolling through Instagram or TikTok for 10 minutes only to realize it’s actually been two hours. And it’s fun (no really)! Just like your favorite Netflix show a book allows you to escape into another world for 30 minutes to an hour at a time.

Many popular shows are actually based on novels. The Queen’s Gambit Game of Thrones and the Umbrella Academy are all TV shows adapted from books just to name a few. Plus a book is always better than its TV or movie counterpart; adaptations tend to leave some details out and by reading the book version you get to explore even more of your favorite worlds again. If you’re not into longer novels you can read a memoir by your favorite celebrity or you can read a comic book about your favorite Marvel or DC character. Just like the overwhelming amount of content on streaming services there are so many books that you can sink your teeth into.

If I haven’t convinced you yet in addition to entertainment there are actually numerous health benefits to dedicating just a bit of time to reading each day. For starters reading for pleasure for just 30 minutes a day can reduce the physical and emotional signs of stress. College is stressful (to say the least) and being on our screens all day every day isn’t helping. Reading outside of school work can be a great first step in combating that anxiety we’re all feeling. While an app like TikTok may help relieve stress the blue light from your phone convinces your body that it’s still daytime and this can interfere with much needed sleep after a tough day.

According to Dr. Heidi Moawad the Mayo Clinic suggests that making reading a part of your nightly routine can help relax you before bed and help you sleep better. Personally my sleep schedule has gone out the window during this pandemic. I used to be asleep by 11 each night and now I often struggle to fall asleep before 12:30 a.m. But now after around 45 minutes of reading I am exhausted and I fall asleep pretty quickly.

Additionally reading has been found to strengthen connections in the brain. In fact a study in 2013 found that reading a book increases communication between the areas of the brain that regulate speech and language processing. Yet another benefit to reading is that it can increase your vocabulary which can be a simple way to improve your performance on graduate school entrance exams and job interviews.

Moreover reading consistently also helps relieve symptoms of depression as it makes people feel less isolated and alone. When you’re reading about characters you love it’s almost like you’re a part of the story. As college students especially during a pandemic our mental health isn’t at an all-time high. School is already stressful but now we’ve got the added anxiety of COVID-19 and self isolation. The perfect way to stop yourself from constantly checking GauchoSpace and worrying about the state of the planet is to open a good book and read about a different world with fascinating characters.

Now you might be saying to yourself “Well I don’t like reading…” or “I don’t have time to read…” but that can change! According to Uma Naidoo a nutritional psychiatrist and director of nutritional & lifestyle psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital the easiest way to start reading more is to pick a designated time to read each day or each week. This way it becomes a part of your routine and soon enough you’ll want to pick up a book without even thinking about it.

When you’ve watched everything on Netflix or you just need some time away from a bright screen: Read. I promise it’ll become your favorite part of the day. And you don’t have to come out guns blazing and commit to reading a 300-page novel. To start out commit to reading an hour a week. Not only will you enjoy yourself but you’ll also see a reduction in your stress and an improvement in your sleep. Even if you only read a couple of pages a day you’ll also see a decrease in your screen time which we all definitely need to work on.

If you want some tips on how to get started check out these three videos on Youtube. They offer some great advice on how to get into reading and how to increase the amount of reading you do. So now that you’re done reading this go crack open a book and enjoy!

Julia Pekala believes that reading and taking time away from screens is the best way to cope with the combined stress of online courses and a pandemic.

The Florida estate was first listed back in 2007 for $85 million before it was rebuilt.

Norman 65 purchased the property for just $6.4 million in 1991. Since then the property has expanded by nearly 632 sqm using a permit that was set to expire.

In total the total property sits on a whopping 8.31-acre lot spanning 2960 sqm.

It includes eight houses in total — the main house a coach house a pool house a tennis house a boat house a carriage house and a beach house — plus a 465 sqm basement.

The Aussie golf legend took a break from discussing his “hilarious” bulge photo that went viral to tell the Miami Herald that his real estate “vision was to create a sanctuary.”

The main house has 10 bedrooms and 13 bathrooms with oceanfront views and complete privacy.

It includes a US Open regulation-size tennis court a fitness centre a movie theatre a lift two main pools a spa a 1900-bottle wine cellar a bar and a gourmet kitchen.

“My wife and I feel it is time to move on after 30 years here” Norman said.

“COVID-19 and the whole pandemic experience with social distancing and being isolated from our families — most of whom live overseas — this past year has made us realise how short life truly is and has caused us to re-evaluate how and where we want to spend the rest of our lives.”

“Memories here are numerous and endless and they will be forever etched in our minds” he said of the home.

It’s not the first property that Norman has looked to sell recently. Last year the Shark put his incredible $60 million Seven Lakes ranch up for sale.

The 12000 acre hunting estate which includes a private fishing river and saloon has been dubbed a “sporting paradise”.

The property is surrounded by rivers and mountains and also considered to be he finest fishing and hunting ranch in Colorado.

The 2001 World Golf Hall of Fame inductee with the highest percentage of votes (80 per cent) of any golfer to date Norman spent 331 weeks as the world’s No. 1 officially ranked golfer.

He has won 89 professional tournaments in total including 20 PGA Tour tournaments and two majors the Open Championships in 1986 and 1993.

Norman also made headlines in November when he detailed the severe COVID-19 symptoms that “kicked the crap” out of him causing him to return to a hospital after initially thinking he had beat the worst of the disease.

“I am fit and strong and have a high tolerance for pain but this is like nothing I have ever experienced before” Norman wrote on Instagram at the time.

Was it the founding of an online search company Backrub by a couple of software engineers in 1998? Or when NewsCorp sold MySpace for $US35 million in 2011 writing off an investment of $US580 million. Or maybe the seminal moment was the public listing of Facebook in 2012 for a seemingly ridiculous valuation of $US90 billion?

Backrub was renamed Google Myspace became dead space and Facebook now has a market capitalisation of $US720 billion. No wonder the former giants of media in Australia are aggrieved – News Corp and Nine that is. Since 2012 the two dominant media companies Nine Media (formerly Fairfax) and the newspaper arm of News Corp have lost billions of dollars in market value.

The old media are now tiny by comparison; the market value of News Corp and Nine at $14.8bn and $4.1bn vis-a-vis Google and Facebook at $1.62 trillion and $964bn respectively.

And what do most corporations do when the value of their business is in steep decline and profits are down? When the “hidden hand of the market” is actually working? Run to the Government for help of course. Nine and News complained to the ACCC that these big bad global companies had stolen their advertising revenue! “All we want to do is provide quality journalism and we can no longer afford to” they cried.

That Facebook and Google have too much power is clear. However the proposed legislation being debated in Parliament does nothing to protect consumers from the search and social media giants. Nor does it serve the lofty purpose of supporting quality journalism.

All it is designed to do is to direct a small fraction of the money earned by the Internet giants to old media.

The legislation doesn’t tackle the critical issue of of how the social media platforms in particular Facebook continue to distribute fake news and hate speech how it continues to be a platform for misinformation and wild conspiracy theories and how it generally turbo-charges the polarisation of public debate. All in the mistaken name of free speech.

Nor does the legislation tackle Google’s search dominance.

These companies pose a global challenge so there are limits to what Australia can do. (Although we could start by taxing them properly.) Google’s threat to leave the local market is real and that would hurt consumers and small independent media immeasurably more than it would hurt News and Nine. Facebook threatening not to accept links to news content will primarily hurt online independent media such as this site as well as consumers.

And this is the strange paradox. Google drives traffic to the news sites such as this website which is free. However it also drives traffic to the paywalled websites of News and Nine.

Elsewhere the US has launched anti-trust actions against Google and Facebook claiming both companies have used their market power to curb competition. These cases will take many years to resolve. By way of comparison the Federal Trade Commission’s cases against Microsoft’s dominance over the PC industry took nine years from the first investigation in 1992 to when it was ultimately settled in 2001.

The European Union has been more effective in their actions against market dominance at least in a fiscal sense. Google has been fined almost $US10 billion in various cases over the past five years. Yet little has changed as Google remains totally dominant in search.

Facebook has also faced scrutiny and has been fined over its privacy breaches – most notably after the Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2016. Cambridge obtained without consent the personal data of millions of Facebook users primarily for political advertising purposes. But Facebook’s behaviour hasn’t changed much either.

And as ignorant Parliamentarians Rod Sims of the ACCC and mainstream media executives huff and puff the stark reality is that Australia cannot curb their market power merely by punitive financial means. They are just too big too wealthy and frankly they don’t give a damn.

But there are other options.

Licensing

The Internet is in effect a broadcasting platform. To broadcast TV and radio in Australia (and most other countries) you need a licence. Licenses cost money and come with conditions around what the owners can and cannot do regulated by the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA). The rules cover content advertising and state that news and stories must be presented in a balanced way. ACMA is a forum for complaints regulate gambling and gaming sites and the rules also impose restrictions on foreign ownership.

As a sovereign nation we have a right and an obligation to regulate media. It can’t be a “one size fits all” approach but in light of the overwhelming power of online media giants it seems an obvious starting point that companies that operate search engines and publish online in Australia should have a license and abide by the rules under penalty of forfeiting that licence.

Publishing

The licensing of search engines would be breaking new ground but the licensing of social media platforms is relatively straightforward. Facebook Instagram Twitter and the rest are publishers however much they deny the fact. Publishing used to be the domain of established writers and journalists working for organisations. But now everybody can be or pretend to be either of those things by sharing their words videos podcasts or pictures online.

The social media platforms cannot claim content neutrality and should therefore be subject to most of the same laws and regulations as other publishers including defamation and minimum standards of truth and proof.

Know thy source

Social media postings have taken over from letters to the editor as the primary means for the general public to make their voices heard. Reputable newspapers do not publish letters without knowing who they are written by – and this publication is no different. There are always reasons for stories to be attributed to an anonymous writer but the publisher must still know who the writer is.

Social media should be compelled to do the same demanding ID checks the way a bank or government agency does in return for services or participation. If MrPotatoHead or MsQanonRules doesn’t have an ID tough luck. This of course can only work if current privacy practices are turned on their head giving users confidence and protection.

Privacy

One of the most egregious aspects of social media is that they have been allowed to get away with flouting privacy principles. We the consumers gave them that right by saying yes to using their platform for free in return for access to personal data including our usage history. And now we pay the price as our collective data has become someone else’s asset.

Social media must be compelled to guard our data in the same way banks guard our money and our ID must be stored entirely separate from our meta- and usage-data. Any identifiable data cannot be shared and our data sold without express consent. Currently consent is basically assumed unless one has opted out if that option is even available.

These measures are not trivial will take time to implement and will also meet with plenty of resistance from Google Facebook et al. And it will cost them to implement. Whether it will cost them more or less than what the cost of sharing a portion of their advertising revenues is anybody’s guess. But this is a better use of their money than simply giving it to the old and failing media behemoths.

Meanwhile Google’s dramatic threat to leave Australia is real. It would be a last resort though. The platforms are immensely profitable in Australia so court actions would come first.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN1bi5jby51ay9uZXdzLzEzOTA1MTMyL21hbi1kZWFkLXNoYXJrLXNvdXRoLWF1c3RyYWxpYS_SAUpodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVzdW4uY28udWsvbmV3cy8xMzkwNTEzMi9tYW4tZGVhZC1zaGFyay1zb3V0aC1hdXN0cmFsaWEvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Haunting final photo of dad snorkelling as son 2 played on beach before he died and was eaten by shark...,"A HAUNTING final photo of a dad snorkelling while his son played on the beach was taken just moments before he died and was eaten by a shark.

The photo - which shows little Levi playing with a yellow spade on the sand and Duncan swimming in the ocean - was the final time the boy was pictured with his dad.

The family had been camping at Port MacDonnell last month when Duncan disappeared in the water while his wife and son were playing on the beach.

His remains were later found near the popular tourist spot.

Initially when search teams recovered a torn wetsuit they believed Duncan had been attacked by a great white shark that had been spotted in the area 9News reports.

Further investigations led authorities to believe that the man died suddenly from an undisclosed natural cause before his body was eaten by a shark.

The family said in a statement: ""While we may never know for sure based on the evidence we do have we now believe it is most likely Duncan suffered a medical episode long before the arrival of the shark.

""It brings us comfort to know that he would have passed away peacefully in the water.""

Duncan's family and friends held a memorial to remember the man on Sunday and said they will continue enjoying the outdoors just as he did.

Bret Trigg the victim's brother-in-law told 9News: ""The last week has been extremely traumatic for all of us but having Levi to look at it's just giving us that little bit of strength to keep moving forward.""

A GoFundMe page named 'Duncan's Legaci for Levi' was created after Duncan's death raising more than $41000 at the time of writing.

It reads: ""Levi now knows his daddy is in heaven and Duncan’s family and friends are determined to ensure he will remember how much Duncan loved his little man.

""While the love guidance and presence of a father is irreplaceable we believe that some additional financial support will help set Levi up for the future.""

All it is designed to do is to direct a small fraction of the money earned by the Internet giants to old media.

The legislation doesn’t tackle the critical issue of of how the social media platforms in particular Facebook continue to distribute fake news and hate speech how it continues to be a platform for misinformation and wild conspiracy theories and how it generally turbo-charges the polarisation of public debate. All in the mistaken name of free speech.

Nor does the legislation tackle Google’s search dominance.

These companies pose a global challenge so there are limits to what Australia can do. (Although we could start by taxing them properly.) Google’s threat to leave the local market is real and that would hurt consumers and small independent media immeasurably more than it would hurt News and Nine. Facebook threatening not to accept links to news content will primarily hurt online independent media such as this site as well as consumers.

And this is the strange paradox. Google drives traffic to the news sites such as this website which is free. However it also drives traffic to the paywalled websites of News and Nine.

Elsewhere the US has launched anti-trust actions against Google and Facebook claiming both companies have used their market power to curb competition. These cases will take many years to resolve. By way of comparison the Federal Trade Commission’s cases against Microsoft’s dominance over the PC industry took nine years from the first investigation in 1992 to when it was ultimately settled in 2001.

The European Union has been more effective in their actions against market dominance at least in a fiscal sense. Google has been fined almost $US10 billion in various cases over the past five years. Yet little has changed as Google remains totally dominant in search.

Facebook has also faced scrutiny and has been fined over its privacy breaches – most notably after the Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2016. Cambridge obtained without consent the personal data of millions of Facebook users primarily for political advertising purposes. But Facebook’s behaviour hasn’t changed much either.

And as ignorant Parliamentarians Rod Sims of the ACCC and mainstream media executives huff and puff the stark reality is that Australia cannot curb their market power merely by punitive financial means. They are just too big too wealthy and frankly they don’t give a damn.

But there are other options.

Licensing

The Internet is in effect a broadcasting platform. To broadcast TV and radio in Australia (and most other countries) you need a licence. Licenses cost money and come with conditions around what the owners can and cannot do regulated by the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA). The rules cover content advertising and state that news and stories must be presented in a balanced way. ACMA is a forum for complaints regulate gambling and gaming sites and the rules also impose restrictions on foreign ownership.

As a sovereign nation we have a right and an obligation to regulate media. It can’t be a “one size fits all” approach but in light of the overwhelming power of online media giants it seems an obvious starting point that companies that operate search engines and publish online in Australia should have a license and abide by the rules under penalty of forfeiting that licence.

Publishing

The licensing of search engines would be breaking new ground but the licensing of social media platforms is relatively straightforward. Facebook Instagram Twitter and the rest are publishers however much they deny the fact. Publishing used to be the domain of established writers and journalists working for organisations. But now everybody can be or pretend to be either of those things by sharing their words videos podcasts or pictures online.

The social media platforms cannot claim content neutrality and should therefore be subject to most of the same laws and regulations as other publishers including defamation and minimum standards of truth and proof.

Know thy source

Social media postings have taken over from letters to the editor as the primary means for the general public to make their voices heard. Reputable newspapers do not publish letters without knowing who they are written by – and this publication is no different. There are always reasons for stories to be attributed to an anonymous writer but the publisher must still know who the writer is.

Social media should be compelled to do the same demanding ID checks the way a bank or government agency does in return for services or participation. If MrPotatoHead or MsQanonRules doesn’t have an ID tough luck. This of course can only work if current privacy practices are turned on their head giving users confidence and protection.

Privacy

One of the most egregious aspects of social media is that they have been allowed to get away with flouting privacy principles. We the consumers gave them that right by saying yes to using their platform for free in return for access to personal data including our usage history. And now we pay the price as our collective data has become someone else’s asset.

Social media must be compelled to guard our data in the same way banks guard our money and our ID must be stored entirely separate from our meta- and usage-data. Any identifiable data cannot be shared and our data sold without express consent. Currently consent is basically assumed unless one has opted out if that option is even available.

These measures are not trivial will take time to implement and will also meet with plenty of resistance from Google Facebook et al. And it will cost them to implement. Whether it will cost them more or less than what the cost of sharing a portion of their advertising revenues is anybody’s guess. But this is a better use of their money than simply giving it to the old and failing media behemoths.

Meanwhile Google’s dramatic threat to leave Australia is real. It would be a last resort though. The platforms are immensely profitable in Australia so court actions would come first.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN1bi5jby51ay9uZXdzLzEzOTA1MTMyL21hbi1kZWFkLXNoYXJrLXNvdXRoLWF1c3RyYWxpYS_SAUpodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVzdW4uY28udWsvbmV3cy8xMzkwNTEzMi9tYW4tZGVhZC1zaGFyay1zb3V0aC1hdXN0cmFsaWEvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Haunting final photo of dad snorkelling as son 2 played on beach before he died and was eaten by shark...,"A HAUNTING final photo of a dad snorkelling while his son played on the beach was taken just moments before he died and was eaten by a shark.

Taylia Craw took a picture of her two-year-old son Levi with his dad Duncan 32 in the background during a family trip in South Australia.

The photo - which shows little Levi playing with a yellow spade on the sand and Duncan swimming in the ocean - was the final time the boy was pictured with his dad.

The family had been camping at Port MacDonnell last month when Duncan disappeared in the water while his wife and son were playing on the beach.

His remains were later found near the popular tourist spot.

Initially when search teams recovered a torn wetsuit they believed Duncan had been attacked by a great white shark that had been spotted in the area 9News reports.

Further investigations led authorities to believe that the man died suddenly from an undisclosed natural cause before his body was eaten by a shark.

The family said in a statement: ""While we may never know for sure based on the evidence we do have we now believe it is most likely Duncan suffered a medical episode long before the arrival of the shark.

""It brings us comfort to know that he would have passed away peacefully in the water.""

Duncan's family and friends held a memorial to remember the man on Sunday and said they will continue enjoying the outdoors just as he did.

Bret Trigg the victim's brother-in-law told 9News: ""The last week has been extremely traumatic for all of us but having Levi to look at it's just giving us that little bit of strength to keep moving forward.""

A GoFundMe page named 'Duncan's Legaci for Levi' was created after Duncan's death raising more than $41000 at the time of writing.

It reads: ""Levi now knows his daddy is in heaven and Duncan’s family and friends are determined to ensure he will remember how much Duncan loved his little man.

""While the love guidance and presence of a father is irreplaceable we believe that some additional financial support will help set Levi up for the future.""

The Wilmot Energy Center a 100-megawatt AC photovoltaic project with 30MW of linked battery storage is under construction by developer NextEra Energy Resources and is scheduled to begin operations as early as April a spokesman for the Florida-based company said.

TEP will buy power from the center — which features 314000 solar panels on 1130 acres — under a 20-year contract.

“Once operational Wilmot Energy Center will create additional revenue for the community and clean renewable solar energy in Arizona for years to come” NextEra’s Conlan Kennedy said. “We look forward to bringing the project online.”

Construction on the roughly $145 million project which began in August will create about 250 jobs Kennedy noted.

TEP spokesman Joe Barrios said the company has completed a substation and switchyard on the site which will be linked to the city’s grid with existing and planned transmission lines.

The Wilmot Energy Center is a key piece of TEP’s plan to reach 70% renewable energy generation by 2035 Barrios said.

The battery system will allow TEP to bank power for the late afternoon and early evening summer hours of peak demand when power production from photovoltaic panels starts fading with the sun.

“The Wilmot Energy Center represents another big step for us toward building a cleaner greener grid” Barrios said. “Solar energy will be generated and stored during peak production hours then used later during high usage periods to meet our customers’ energy needs.”

Barrios noted that including two 10MW battery systems TEP installed in 2017 TEP will have about 50MW of energy storage resources by the end of 2021 with plans to expand that to more than 1400MW by 2035.

Power from the Wilmot Energy Center will be relatively cheap.

TEP made industrywide news when it announced in 2017 that it would buy Wilmot’s solar power for less than 3 cents per kilowatt hour or under 4.5 cents with battery power included — an industry low at the time.

NEW TEP BENCHMARK

Expected to provide enough renewable power to serve up to 21000 homes annually the Wilmot Energy Center will be TEP’s largest solar energy resource.

It will be TEP’s second-largest renewable energy source after the 250MW Oso Grande Wind Project in southeast New Mexico. The wind farm which is owned by TEP is undergoing final testing and is expected to go online very soon Barrios said.

The biggest solar farm now serving TEP is the Avalon Solar I & II installation in Sahuarita with a combined generating capacity of 45 megawatts followed by the 41MW Red Horse Solar plant the 25MW Avra Valley Solar Generating Station and 20MW Picture Rocks Solar plant in Marana.

Those plants are owned by companies that sell power to TEP under long-term power purchase agreements.

TEP’s biggest company-owned solar farm is a 17MW photovoltaic plant at Fort Huachuca in Sierra Vista. The utility also owns an 8.5MW photovoltaic array adjacent to its coal-fired Springerville Generating Station 6MW of photovoltaic at the University of Arizona Tech Park and a 4.5MW solar farm near Old Vail and East Valencia roads.

AMONG THE STATE’S BIGGEST

The Wilmot Energy Center will be among the biggest renewable-energy plants in Arizona.

The largest solar farm serving an Arizona utility is the Solana Generating Station near Gila Bend a 280-megawatt concentrated solar power system that serves Arizona Public Service Co.

The plant consists of a rows of trough shaped mirrors that concentrate sunlight heating up a salt solution used to drive steam generators.

APS also gets solar power from nearly 20 smaller photovoltaic plants including the 40MW Red Rock solar farm in southern Pinal County the 35MW Foothills Solar Plant near Yuma and the 32MW Gila Bend Solar Plant.

Arizona’s two biggest solar farms — the 400MW Mesquite Solar Project near the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station west of Phoenix and the 290MW Agua Caliente solar plant in Yuma County — sell all their power to California’s Pacific Gas & Electric Co.

HOOKING IT UP

While TEP will make immediate use of Wilmot’s power planned transmission line projects will help project that power efficiently across the city’s grid and help light up the University of Arizona with clean power.

In September 2019 TEP announced a 20-year agreement with the UA to provide 100% clean energy to its Tucson campus starting at the end of 2020.

TEP agreed to dedicate portions of new wind and solar energy projects including the Wilmot Energy Center and the Oso Grande wind project to serving the UA’s energy needs.

A new transmission line from the Wilmot Energy Center switchyard to a new substation nearby was approved by state regulators in 2019 and will connect with TEP’s H. Wilson Sundt Generating Station on East Irvington Road.

TEP is also working on new transmission lines from the Irvington plant to a new substation on South Kino Parkway and a line from the Kino substation past the UA and up to a power plant and switchyard near Interstate 10 and West Grant Road.

The preferred route for that line has not been officially proposed to state regulators but some residents of historic neighborhoods near the UA have objected to a proposed route along North Campbell Ave.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vbmVzbi5jb20vMjAyMS8wMS9oYWlsaWUtZGVlZ2FuLXJldmVhbHMtbmFzY2FyLXRydWNrLXNoZWxsLXJ1bi1hdC1kYXl0b25hL9IBVWh0dHBzOi8vbmVzbi5jb20vMjAyMS8wMS9oYWlsaWUtZGVlZ2FuLXJldmVhbHMtbmFzY2FyLXRydWNrLXNoZWxsLXJ1bi1hdC1kYXl0b25hL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hailie Deegan Reveals NASCAR Truck She’ll Run At Daytona,"Hailie Deegan is ready for the biggest race of her NASCAR career.

NKE,Nike,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmludmVyc2UuY29tL2lucHV0L3N0eWxlL25pa2UtZHVuay1sb3ctYnkteW91LW9uLWZlZXQtcmV2aWV3LXJlbGVhc2UtZGF0ZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,I made my own Nike Dunk and now all other sneakers are trash,"Ever since Nike (quietly) revealed that it would let people customize its Dunk sneaker which is arguably its hottest silhouette right now I knew immediately I needed a pair to call my own. Little did I know though that trying to buy the damn shoes would become such a nightmare. Because despite Nike knowing that its ""By You"" Dunk Lows were going to be heavily sought-after the company wasn't prepared for launch day on January 7: Its site went from giving customers errors codes while they tried to tinker with their designs to fully crashing and not letting them complete their purchases.

But somehow amid the virtual shopping chaos I managed to snag a pair for $110. That was thanks in large part to the fact I saved my Dunk design on Nike's site days before the drop and the fact I never gave up on refreshing the checkout page despite running into an avalanche of error messages. After all that it felt so good to get the win especially since Nike has decided to make Dunk sneakers (be it the SB or classics) extremely limited and difficult to get nowadays. It's such a shame that what used to be a shoe that would sit on shelves at Kohl's or Journey's back in the day is now a hype phenomenon but ultimately Nike doesn't care about any of our feelings.

Nike is going to sell its highly coveted goods regardless even if drops like this are a total and utter mess and even if its SNKRS app continues to be an embarrassment and the brunt of the joke for the entire sneaker community.

Edgar Alvarez / Input

Still now I'm over the moon that my Dunk By You creation is here at my doorstep. As someone who grew up as a skate / emo kid Dunks were always one of my go-tos in the early 2000s namely because they were cheaper than Air Jordans and because I always loved how they looked after being beat up. Their aesthetic hasn't changed since and while I mostly wear high-top sneakers in this day and age I just couldn't pass up the opportunity to put my own spin on the iconic Dunk silhouette.

As you can see I went for a green white and red theme which was my way of paying homage to the Mexican flag — the place where I'm from. To spice it up a bit —how would I do my Mexicans proud if I didn't add spice to something? — I went for a black Nike ""Swoosh"" logo simply as a nod to my preference for blacked-out outfits. I also mixed up leather materials (green and red) with suede (white and black) just to give it a touch of subtle elegance.

Edgar Alvarez / Input

And last but most definitely not least I appreciate that Nike let me pick a gum bottom outsole. It reminds me of all the old school Dunks I used to have and that design detail alone makes make me love these so much more. I don't have a name for them by the way but I think something along the line of the ""Taco"" Dunks would work but that's only because I'm into tacos as much as sneakers nothing really to do with the shoes aside from tacos being a Mexican treasure.

My only regret is that I couldn't get a second pair so that I would have an extra one in storage for when I eventually wear these the hell out. I know I know I should be happy that I got a pair since thousands of other people didn't — and believe me I am. Here's hoping Nike does another round of By You Dunk Lows so that others have a chance. It's only right but then again I wouldn't hold my breath.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hc2RhcS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvMy1jYXRhbHlzdHMtZm9yLW5pa2UtaW4tMjAyMS0yMDIxLTAxLTMw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3 Catalysts for Nike in 2021,"Despite Nike's (NYSE: NKE) stock price surging 30% over the last 12 months 2020 was a mixed bag for the swoosh. Store closures weighed on sales but investors have high expectations for Nike's digital business which has tremendous momentum right now.

While the stock trades at a steep price tag of 44 times forward earnings estimates there are three catalysts on the horizon that could justify the lofty share price.

1. E-commerce growth

In recent earnings reports management has emphasized that the consumer shift to digital is here to stay. That appears to be the case after a strong fiscal 2021 second-quarter earnings report in December.

Nike's digital sales growth over the last three quarters has been off the charts up 79% (Q4 2020) 83% (Q1 2021) and 80% (Q2 2021) year over year on a currency-neutral basis. Most impressive is that this level of growth remained consistent even as physical stores reopened.

More than 90% of Nike's stores were open in the fiscal second quarter (which ended in November) yet digital sales were still growing slightly faster than the fiscal fourth quarter of 2020 when most stores were closed at the start of the pandemic.

Looking ahead Nike has a great opportunity to drive higher repeat sales from existing customers. The company added 70 million new members during the pandemic and drove 7 billion brand impressions on social media platforms in the most recent quarter.

2. Return of live sports

Nike has historically relied on sporting events to market its brand to consumers. There is no better marketing for the company than sports fans watching their favorite athletes wear Nike gear so a return of live sporting events should be a plus in the short term.

To get its stores back to normal sales levels Nike plans to ramp up marketing investments or what it calls demand creation in the near term.

Management's guidance for fiscal 2021 calls for revenue growth to be in the low teens. Profits should rise even faster given the outlook for improved gross margin and only a single-digit increase in operating expense growth.

For what it's worth Wall Street analysts expect Nike to beat its own guidance. Analysts forecast revenue growth to be 15% in fiscal 2021 with earnings per share recovering to $3.02.

3. Investments in data science

Nike's investments in technology before the pandemic came at the perfect time. Over the last three years Nike has made three acquisitions that expanded the company's digital sales capabilities.

In 2018 Nike acquired two technology businesses Zodiac and Israel-based Invertex. These firms strengthened the company's capabilities in data analytics and artificial intelligence while the acquisition of Celect in 2019 added expertise in retail predictive analytics and demand sensing.

Management credited Celect's demand-sensing technology for helping drive 100% year-over-year digital revenue growth in North America during peak holiday demand in the last quarter.

The digital segment including sales from retail partners' digital channels already exceeds 30% of Nike's entire business. Obviously there is a lot of room for it to grow. What's more the higher margins from digital sales should provide a tailwind to Nike's earnings growth.

It's difficult to predict where the stock goes in the short term but Nike remains one of the best consumer discretionary stocks to buy. It's ahead of the game in e-commerce which positions the company well to deliver market-beating gains for investors.

There’s a lot of attention focused on the Valentine’s Day Air Force 1 Low releases in early February but you had better make room for this latest set from the Nike Sportswear team. This most recent concept adds just a subtlest of upgrades by way of a rose flower on the midsole AIR accent but don’t mistake the floral touch for a Valentine’s Day treat. Rather this is an extension of the brand’s “Have A Nike Day” collection that launched nearly two years ago.

Two colorway options are presented: a classic all-white with a red/pine green detail and a second in a feminine “Pink Foam” without the natural green accent. Both are connected by the “Have A Nike Day” logo on the insole as well as the custom tongue label that mimics the design of plastic take-out shopping bags.

The Belfast Trust has confirmed the number of Covid-19 doses wasted since the rollout began.

They said 32390 doses of the vaccination had been administered since the programme began on December 8.

In a statement the Trust said that 66 doses have been recorded as ""wastage"" so far - around 0.20% of all total vaccines.

A spokesperson for the Belfast Trust said: ""On occasion there was a small wastage due to unpredictable circumstances or difficulty administering the vaccine due to residents' clinical condition.

""Contingency plans were also in place in order to offer the vaccine to other priority groups in order to reduce wastage such as vaccinating other local Care Home staff in the area.

""The vaccine is incredibly fragile therefore on the very rare occasion that it is mishandled this can also lead to a small number of vaccines having to be discarded.""

The trust spokesperson added that they were ""committed in implementing the vaccine roll out in line with guidance"" and they had been successful in making sure vaccination slots are filled to maximise the amount of people receiving the vaccine each day.

Meanwhile the Department of Health (DoH) said the amount of Covid-19 vaccines being wasted for the entire country was around 0.5%.

As of January 29 220000 vaccinations had been administered across six health boards.

The DoH said 196131 of those vaccines were first doses and 24070 were second doses.

In a statement to Belfast Live a spokesperson for the DoH said there was ""processes and protocols in place at every stage of the Covid-19 vaccination programme to minimise vaccine wastage"".

The statement read: ""Vaccination slots at HSC regional Vaccination Clinics are very well attended.

""Where there is someone unable to attend or who cannot have the vaccine there is a system in place to try and fill that slot to avoid vaccine wastage.

""GPs are also managing their vaccination programmes very efficiently to minimise any wastage of the vaccine and as with the HSC centres GPs will attempt to ensure any vaccine left over from a clinic is administered to other eligible patients.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

The UK’s first fleet of uncrewed fighter aircraft is one step closer to reality following a £30-million contract to design and manufacture a prototype in a three-year deal supporting more than 100 jobs in Belfast.

The uncrewed combat aircraft will be designed to fly at high-speed alongside fighter jets armed with missiles surveillance and electronic warfare technology to provide a battle-winning advantage over hostile forces. Known as a ‘loyal wingman’ these aircraft will be the UK’s first uncrewed platforms able to target and shoot down enemy aircraft and survive against surface to air missiles.

In a boost for Northern Ireland’s defence industry Spirit AeroSystems Belfast have been selected to lead Team MOSQUITO in the next phase of the Project. Utilising ground-breaking engineering techniques the team will further develop the RAF’s Lightweight Affordable Novel Combat Aircraft (LANCA) concept with a full-scale vehicle flight-test programme expected by the end of 2023.

Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said:

This is fantastic news and underlines the distinct strengths in Northern Ireland’s economy through its advanced engineering and manufacturing capabilities.

This ground-breaking project will involve significant investment which will not only support local employment but also reinforce Northern Ireland’s contribution to the security of our nation.

Team MOSQUITO which also includes Northrop Grumman UK will mature the designs and manufacture a technology demonstrator to generate evidence for a follow-on LANCA programme. If successful Project Mosquito’s findings could lead to this revolutionary capability being deployed alongside the Typhoon and F-35 Lightning jets by the end of the decade.

Defence Minister Jeremy Quin said:

This is a great win for the Northern Ireland defence industry and will showcase some of the most pioneering engineering work currently being undertaken in the UK.

The £30 million project will accelerate the development of the UK’s future air power by delivering cutting-edge uncrewed aircraft maintaining our position as a world leader in emerging technologies.

Working with innovative partners from across the UK Project Mosquito is transforming traditional approaches to combat air to enable the rapid development of technology. By utilising the latest software development techniques and civilian aerospace engineering and manufacturing expertise the project will deliver dramatic reductions in costs and development timelines so their innovations can reach the front-line quicker than ever before.

This game changing research and development project will ensure the final aircraft design will be capable of being easily and affordably updated with the latest technology so we remain one step ahead of our adversaries. The aircraft’s flexibility will provide the optimum protection survivability and information as it flies alongside Typhoon F-35 Lightning and later Tempest as part of our future combat air system.

Air Chief Marshal Mike Wigston Chief of the Air Staff said:

We’re taking a revolutionary approach looking at a game-changing mix of swarming drones and uncrewed fighter aircraft like Mosquito alongside piloted fighters like Tempest that will transform the combat battlespace in a way not seen since the advent of the jet age.

Director Future Combat Air Richard Berthon said:

Project Mosquito is a vital element of our approach to Future Combat Air rapidly bringing to life design build and test skills for next generation combat air capabilities. Autonomous ‘loyal wingman’ aircraft create the opportunity to expand diversify and rapidly upgrade Combat Air Forces in a cost-effective way now and in the future.

As announced by the Prime Minister in November 2020 the UK’s Future Combat Air System (FCAS) programme is set to benefit from a portion of the extra £1.5 billion investment into military research and development which will help ensure our Armed Forces are prepared to meet the threats of tomorrow.

LANCA originated in 2015 in Dstl to understand innovative Combat Air technologies and concepts that offer radical reductions in cost and development time and is a RAF Rapid Capabilities Office led project under the Future Combat Air System Technology Initiative (FCAS TI).

For the January 2021 issue we asked

Will precise point positioning (PPP) replace real-time kinematic (RTK)? If so for which applications and when?

“Recently Hexagon’s Autonomy & Positioning division demonstrated RTK levels of performance — globally —through PPP technology; we call it RTK From the Sky (see page 29). I believe that PPP adoption rates will grow significantly in the coming years and eventually replace RTK — especially in areas that are not well served by RTK networks or similar services. Adoption rates will depend on which applications can field GNSS receivers capable of the signals and constellations to perform like RTK.”

Miguel Amor

Hexagon’s Autonomy & Positioning division

“For many applications the improved accuracy provided by PPP (10 cm) is sufficient and RTK solutions are not needed. However the typical convergence time of PPP is between 20 and 40 minutes depending on the number of satellites available satellite geometry the quality of the correction products the receiver’s multipath environment and atmospheric conditions. This slow convergence compared to RTK solutions will limit application for many real-time applications such as mobile solutions.”

Alison Brown

NAVSYS Corporation

“PPP-RTK combines near-RTK accuracy and quick initialization times with the broadcast nature of PPP over internet or L-band. PPP-RTK can be seamlessly integrated into GNSS receivers bringing convenient sub-decimeter accuracy to applications where configuring RTK is not practical or where there is no internet connection. PPP-RTK is likely to be adopted by emerging mass-market applications such as UAVs while RTK will probably remain prevalent in applications where it is already well established such as precision agriculture.”

Jean-Marie Sleewaegen

Septentrio

“I do not believe that PPP will replace RTK technology solutions anytime soon. Satellite-based GNSS correction services with an emphasis on global provide worldwide access but achieving the required accuracy due to convergence can be slow. Today myriad users and emerging customers may utilize corrections augmented with RTK transmitter/base stations that hybrid solutions can provide thus solving both the age-old navigation issue of obscuration and near real-time positioning simultaneously.”

Best answer: Only NVIDIA RTX GPUs work with NVIDIA Broadcast. These include the RTX 20 series RTX 30 Series Quadro RTX and TITAN RTX series of GPUs. Basically any NVIDIA GPU with the RTX branding in its name should work with Broadcast. NVIDIA Broadcast does not work with GTX series and other non-RTX Series NVIDIA GPUs.Balanced RTX experience: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 ($500 at Best Buy)The best RTX GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 ($1500 at Best Buy)RTX on a Budget: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti ($400 at Best Buy)

Every GPU that supports NVIDIA Broadcast

NVIDIA Broadcast is built on top of the RTX Broadcast engine which NVIDIA announced in 2019. It is designed to leverage the raw power that the NVIDIA's RTX GPUs bring to the table and is therefore exclusive to the RTX-branded GPUs. The following GPUs support broadcast:

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090

NVIDIA Quadro RTX 3000

NVIDIA Quadro RTX 4000

NVIDIA Quadro RTX 5000

NVIDIA Quadro RTX 6000

NVIDIA Quadro RTX 8000

NVIDIA TITAN RTX

Supported GPUs also include all variants of these cards including Ti SUPER and Max-Q versions. Additionally NVIDIA Broadcast system requirements include 8 GB or higher RAM and have at least an Intel Core i5 8600 AMD Ryzen r5 2600 or better CPU. NVIDIA Broadcast doesn't support its non-RTX range of GPUs.

If you have a GTX GPU you can use the noise removal functionality from Broadcast in its beta form with the NVIDIA RTX Voice plugin. Unfortunately there is no such workaround for the video enhancements.

Note: NVIDIA RTX 30 Series GPUs and AMD RX 6000 Series GPUs are in very limited supply as of now and constantly going out of stock.

Why use NVIDIA Broadcast?

NVIDIA Broadcast is an app for Windows 10 that uses AI and RTX GPUs' power to enhance the voice and video to enrich your live streams voice chats and video conference calls. It can remove the background noise in your audio add a virtual background and track movement in your video.

Broadcast is a nifty little feature addition for the RTX GPUs which are already some of the best GPUs on the market. It will offer enough functionality to eliminate the need to buy additional equipment to get better video and audio quality for most people. If you have an NVIDIA RTX GPU you should absolutely be using Broadcast for your audio and video recording calling and streaming needs.

Hop on the RTX train

NVIDIA RTX GPUs are already a great value if you need raw graphical performance and NVIDIA Broadcast further adds to that value. The app works quite well and if you're planning on building a PC it should definitely count as a con towards your RTX GPU purchase. It's not a selling point per se but a great functionality to have regardless.

While your graphics card is usually the biggest considering when it comes to gaming performance however we also wanted to look at some of the best CPUs for gaming to see just how much performance you lose — or gain! — by running it with something other than the Core i9-9900K we use in our current GPU testbed.

For this article we've pulled out several of the latest AMD and Intel processors: Core i9-10900K Core i9-9900K Core i3-10100 Ryzen 5 3600 and Ryzen 9 3900X. Then just for good measure we've gone old school and dug up an 'ancient' Core i7-4770K Haswell chip. This is the oldest CPU I've currently got hanging around and it should help answer the question of just how much CPU you need to make good use of the RTX 3080.

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

We'll be testing at 1080p 1440 and 4K at both medium and ultra presets. We said in the RTX 3080 review that it's a card primarily designed for 4K gaming and that it starts to hit CPU bottlenecks at 1440p. That applies even more at 1080p with medium settings. Generally speaking you don't buy a top-shelf GPU to play games at 1080p though there are esports pros that do just that while using a 240Hz or even 360Hz monitor. Most games will struggle to hit 240 fps; however some even have fps caps of around 200 fps. But we're doing this for science!

Because we're using multiple platforms and were under time constraints not every PC used identical hardware. In the case of the old Haswell PC it couldn't use most of the modern hardware we install in other testbeds — the sole LGA1150 motherboard I have doesn't have an M.2 slot and of course it requires DDR3 memory. I also only have a single kit of DDR3-1600 CL9-9-9 memory which is fine but certainly not the best possible RAM for such a PC. Cases power supplies SSD and other items also differ though most of these aren't critical as far as gaming performance is concerned.

The DDR4-capable PCs were all tested with the same DDR4-3600 CL16 memory kit while our standard GPU benchmarks use DDR4-3200 CL16 memory. We've included both scores for the 9900K as yet another point of reference. Memory speed matters a bit depending on the game though it doesn't make a huge difference overall. In fact at higher settings the 'slower' DDR4-3200 kit actually came out slightly ahead probably thanks to slightly better subtimings. Here are the full testbed specs:

Swipe to scroll horizontally GeForce RTX 3080 CPU Testing Equipment Platform Z490 Z390 X570 Z97 CPU Core i9-10900K Core i3-10100 Core i9-9900K Ryzen 9 3900X Ryzen 5 3600 Core i7-4770K Cooler NZXT X63 Kraken Corsair H150i RGB Pro NZXT X63 Kraken Be Quiet!

All of the systems are running at stock settings but with XMP memory profiles activated. However the old Z97 board applies an all-core clock of 4.3GHz even at stock settings. It's a bit of a quirky motherboard and the BIOS was finicky enough that I just left it alone. Basically even though it says 4770K treat these results as being representative of a stock-clocked Core i7-4790K. If you actually have a stock clocked 4770K or something like an older i7-2600K your performance will be even lower than what we're showing here.

We're going to start out with 1080p testing which is where the choice of CPU is going to make the biggest difference. None of the games in our test suite are esports titles where extreme fps matters though we do have at least one game that can break into the >360 fps range (Strange Brigade). We've long maintained that there are greatly diminishing returns going beyond 144Hz or even 120Hz displays and a big part of that is the fact that many games simply don't scale to the higher framerates necessary to make the most of higher refresh rates. Okay let's hit the charts:

If you were thinking of pairing the new king of the GPUs with a Core i7-4770K (overclocked) from mid-2013 or maybe even a 3770K or 2600K the worst-case results at 1080p should at least give you pause. There are plenty of situations where your maximum performance is nearly cut in half. With the RTX 3080 the Core i9-10900K is 70% faster at 1080p medium though the gap drops to 47% at 1080p ultra.

Even stepping up to a new Core i3-10100 provides a pretty substantial boost to performance — some of that is from the newer Comet Lake architecture but a lot of the benefit likely comes from the faster memory. The i3-10100 ends up about 25% faster overall compared to the overclocked i7-4770K.

At the other end of the spectrum the move from Core i9-9900K to Core i9-10900K hardly matters at all. At 1080p medium the 10900K is 4% faster across our test suite. That's not a lot and it's not really too surprising. Very few games will leverage more than eight cores so the majority of the improvement comes from the slightly higher clocks on the 10900K. At 1080p ultra the two chips are basically tied. Some of this almost certainly comes down to differences in motherboard firmware however. Even though both testbeds use MSI MEG Ace motherboards (Z390 and Z490) they're not the same. Final Fantasy XIV performs quite a bit worse with the Z490 setup while everything else sees small to modest gains.

What about AMD's CPUs? First let's note that the Ryzen 9 3900X only leads the Ryzen 5 3600 by a scant 7% at medium and 4% at ultra. Several games show nearly a 10% lead while others are effectively tied. That means comparisons between Intel and AMD don't change substantially when moving to a different AMD processor — the Zen 2 chips will all be within 10% of each other. And as we'll see momentarily the AMD CPUs really scrunch together at higher resolutions.

For AMD vs. Intel the Core i9-10900K unsurprisingly comes out on top by a noticeable 18% at 1080p medium. Four of the games we tested give Intel more than a 20% lead with Final Fantasy being the only result that's in the single percentage points. Again we don't expect most gamers would ever pair the RTX 3080 with 1080p medium settings but this is the worst-case scenario for CPU scaling. Shifting up to 1080p ultra Intel's lead drops to just 8%. Far Cry 5 and Shadow of the Tomb Raider still favor Intel by over 20% Metro Exodus shows a 15% lead and everything else is below 10%.

Finally while we didn't do a full suite of testing with ray tracing and DLSS effects it's important to remember that the more demanding a game becomes on your GPU — and ray tracing is definitely demanding — the less your CPU matters. Many games will still need DLSS in performance mode to stay above 60 fps with all the ray tracing effects enabled.

The jump to 1440p represents 78% more pixels but performance only drops by 15% on average at medium settings and 20% at ultra settings. In other words 1080 was very much running into CPU bottlenecks and shifting to a higher resolution doesn't hurt performance all that much even with the fastest CPUs. And if you're using a slower CPU in some cases the change in performance is negligible.

Take the i7-4770K for example. The 1440p medium results are only 3% lower than 1080p medium and the 1440p ultra results are 6% lower than 1080p ultra. If you plan on buying an RTX 3080 and running at 1440p ultra with an older generation CPU you'll lose some performance but not that much. Well maybe. It's worth noting that the i9-9900K with a 2080 Super is faster overall at 1440p medium and below compared to the i7-4770K with a 3080 but the 4770K does at least get a small boost to performance. Or with a 2080 Ti the 9900K even wins at 1440p ultra.

Take just one step up the CPU ladder like moving to a Ryzen 5 3600 or even a Core i3-10100 (which should be about the same level of performance as a Core i7-6700K) and there's at least some benefit to buying an RTX 3080. Still if you're running less than a 6-core CPU we'd definitely recommend upgrading your CPU and perhaps even the rest of your PC before taking the RTX 3080 plunge at 1440p.

As usual 4K is the great CPU equalizer. The demands on the GPU are so high that even a seven-year-old Core i7-4770K now only trails the Core i9-10900K by 8% at 4K ultra. It's still a noticeable 13% behind at 4K medium but hopefully you get the point we're trying to make: The RTX 3080 is very much a graphics card designed to tackle high-resolution gaming. 4K ultra at 60 fps or more is now totally possible and you can do it with a Core i7-4770K Ryzen 5 3600 or go all the way and pair it with a Core i9-10900K or Ryzen 9 3900X.

The gap between current AMD and Intel CPUs at 4K is basically nonexistent. In fact minor differences in board design firmware or just 1% variability in benchmark runs all become factors. The 9900K for example now comes out 'ahead' of the 10900K at 4K medium and the gap is even larger at 4K ultra. That shouldn't happen except it frequently does when you're looking at different motherboards - even with the exact same memory. Maybe the differences in SSD play a role as well.

The point isn't that the 9900K is the fastest CPU at 4K ultra by 1%. The real point is that the difference between the fastest and slowest CPU we tested is only 8% — and if we drop the 4770K the gap shrinks to just 3.5%.

Note that minimum (99th percentile) framerates do show a larger difference. The spread on minimum fps is 19% and still 8.5% if we ignore the 4770K. Also while we don't have exact numbers some of the games definitely take noticeably longer to load on the slower CPUs. Not minutes longer but probably 5-10 seconds more.

In short it's not that the CPU doesn't matter at all at 4K but it doesn't matter very much if all you're doing is playing a game. Of course you might be doing other tasks as well like streaming and encoding your gameplay listening to music chatting on Discord etc. We've isolated gaming performance here as much as possible with a 'clean' OS and testing environment. If you're running any background tasks particularly heavier tasks like streaming having a faster CPU becomes much more important.

GeForce RTX 3080 CPU Scaling: The Bottom Line

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

We fully expected the launch of the GeForce RTX 3080 to push the bottleneck for gaming PCs very much onto the CPU particularly at lower settings and resolutions. That does happen to some extent but not as much as we anticipated. There are other factors to consider as well like the type of games you play. We didn't include testing of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 here for example but that game is currently very much CPU (and API) limited even at ultra settings. Ray tracing effects can also make even 1080p performance far more GPU dependent.

If you're thinking about purchasing the RTX 3080 we still maintain that having a good CPU is important meaning at least a six-core Intel or AMD Ryzen processor. Of course it's all relative as well. Maybe you're looking to upgrade your entire PC in the coming months but you want to wait for Ryzen 5000 to launch. Or maybe you just can't afford to upgrade everything at once. Depending on your current graphics card making the jump to the 3080 might be warranted even on an older PC especially if it's only going to be a temporary solution. How you want to upgrade is a personal decision and it's entirely possible to stuff the RTX 3080 into an old 2nd Gen Core or AMD FX build if you want. We wouldn't recommend doing that but it's possible.

While the biggest differences in performance occurred at lower resolutions and settings it's also important to look at the bigger picture. The Core i9-9900K and 10900K might 'only' be 10% faster than a slower CPU but that's almost a whole step in GPU performance. RTX 2080 Ti was 15-20% faster than the RTX 2080 Super but it cost 70% more. If you're running an older GPU with an older CPU and you're planning to upgrade your graphics card it's probably a good idea to wait and see what the GeForce RTX 3070 brings to the table as well as AMD's Big Navi . You might not miss out on much in terms of performance while saving several hundred dollars depending on the rest of your PC components.

As always the sage advice for upgrades is to only make the jump when your current PC doesn't do what you want it to do. If you're pining for 4K ultra at 60 fps or looking forward to games with even more ray tracing effects the GeForce RTX 3080 is a big jump in generational performance. It's clearly faster than the previous king of the hill (the RTX 2080 Ti or even the Titan RTX) at a substantially lower price. Just don't expect to make full use of the 3080 if you pair it up with an old processor.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ub3RlYm9va2NoZWNrLm5ldC9MZWFrZWQtTlZJRElBLUdlRm9yY2UtUlRYLTMwODAtVGktYmVuY2htYXJrcy1zaG93LXRoZS1HQTEwMi1jYXJkLW9uLXBhci13aXRoLXRoZS1HZUZvcmNlLVJUWC0zMDkwLjUxNzU4NS4wLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Leaked NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti benchmarks show the GA102 card on par with the GeForce RTX 3090,"Unsurprisingly the RTX 3080 Ti appears to perform slightly worse than the RTX 3090 in most cases probably because of its inferior memory bandwidth and VRAM capacity.

We would be remiss for not mentioning some discrepancies in the leak though. On the one hand Big Hardware Player never shows an image of the alleged RTX 3080 Ti in his video. While this does not necessarily mean that the information supplied is fake we find it curious that Big Hardware Player provided no images of the card when he offered so many details about the supposed engineering sample.

On the other hand GPU-Z recognises the card as an RTX 3080 even though the SKU does not exist yet. Similarly we doubt that TechPowerUp has updated GPU-Z to support a card that NVIDIA is yet to announce.

In short not all seems correct with this leak. While it could well be true there are quite a few red flags here. There is also hardly any difference in performance between the RTX 3080 Ti and RTX 3090 so we are at a loss as to why NVIDIA would release the former anyway.

Good news they're frickin' sweet! Bad news Nvidia has made it more difficult than ever to figure out which one is best suited for you.



From eliminating Max-Q labeling making it harder for the average laptop consumer to figure out which device has a handicapped GPU to RTX 3070s having higher base clock speeds than RTX 3080s my head hurts. Whatever happened to 80 is better than 70? Take me back to the simple days.

There are quite a few different aspects at play as some of Nvidia's 30 series GPUs are better suited for software engineers or display more realistic graphics while others boost performance for that smooth frame rate in gaming. It may be a tad trickier to figure out especially as the RTX 30 series don't exactly say what they do on the tin anymore but the main thing to take away from this is Nvidia's new line of GPUs are pretty much all killer.



Thankfully we got our hands on laptops that came with Nvidia 30-Series GPUs including the recently reviewed the Asus TUF Dash F15 and Gigabyte Aero 15 with RTX 3070 the Aorus 15G with RTX 3070 Max-Q and the Alienware m17 R4 with an RTX 3080. This gave us a better idea of how well each GPU performs.



Think of this as my dummy's guide to understanding Nvidia's RTX 30 series GPUs so you can get a better idea of which graphics card is better suited for your next laptop purchase. There's plenty more info to digest and you can find out more on what you need to know about Nvidia’s RTX 30-Series GPUs in our deep dive.

The Nvidia RTX 3060 is still essentially your entry-level graphics card but still had the ability to out-perform an RTX 3080 in terms of boosted clock speeds (GHz) that is. Spec-wise the RTX 3060 GPU has 3840 Nvidia CUDA cores (Nvidia's parallel computing platform that hits CPU cores out of the park) 1283 - 1703MHz boosted clock range and a GPU subsystem power (W) of 60 - 115.



If this looks like gibberish (this is a dummy's guide after all) basically the more CUDA Cores in a GPU the faster it can complete tasks related to graphics. In turn higher CUDA core count more realistic graphics.



As for Nvidia's boosted clock speeds generally this is all about performance meaning smoother functionality when there's a lot of tasks happening especially in games.



GPU subsystem power? This is where things get tricky. This could also be viewed as Total Graphics Power (TGP). As an example: a 115 W RTX 3060 could outperform an 80 W RTX 3080 depending on the given workload.



Labeling a graphics card with Max-Q usually distinguished which end of the range a laptop's GPU would offer but now that Nvidia or the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) don't mention if an RTX GPU is a Max-Q variant in a laptop it's harder to see how well the GPU will actually perform. This is why you should definitely read our laptop reviews before making a definite purchase.



Now that's out of the way the RTX 3060 is definitely for those looking for a boost in performance rather than graphics making it a fantastic mid-range gaming laptop. Its potential boosted clock speeds and high wattage means frame rates will be smooth.

Nvidia RTX 3070: What you need to know

(Image credit: Future)

The RTX 3070 GPUs will most likely be the most popular pick for gaming laptop enthusiasts and will most likely be used more by OEMs. Its specs include 5120 CUDA Cores 1290 - 1620MHz boost clock speeds and 80 - 125W.



The Gigabyte Aero 15 and Asus TUF Dash F15 were both put to the test in gaming. When the Aero 15 ran Assassin’s Creed Odyssey (1080p Very High) it delivered 65 frames per second which surpassed the average mainstream gaming laptop (61 fps) and the TUF Dash F15’s (51 fps).



On the Grand Theft Auto V benchmark (1080p Very High) the Aero 15 hit 96 fps cruising past the average premium gaming laptop (87 fps) and the Asus TUF Dash F15 (84 fps).



We also ran the gaming benchmarks in 4K. On the Assassin’s Creed Odyssey and Valhalla tests the Aero 15 reached 35 fps and 29 fps respectively. These are about half the frame rates than the 1080p setting.



The RTX 3070 is definitely a powerhouse and you'll find that the 3070 has a higher base clock speed and base subsystem power than the RTX 3080 and even RTX 3090 which is a little backward. Being used on higher-end mid-range laptops even means it will generally be cheaper than laptops with an RTX 3080.

Nvidia RTX 3080: What you need to know

(Image credit: Future)

The RTX 3080 boasts 6144 CUDA cores 1245 - 1710MHz boost clock speeds and 50 - 150+W. This could potentially be disappointing to those who paid extra for an RTX 3080 and don't hit the higher-end clock speeds or wattage especially if an RTX 3070 or even 3060 GPU laptop out-performs it. That said it certainly has a higher potential for performance and will clearly display higher graphical details.



In our review of the Alienware m17 R4 the RTX 3080 fully utilized the laptop's 360Hz refresh rate. Along with its 16GB of VRAM we ran the Assassin’s Creed Odyssey benchmark and the m17 R4 reached 78 fps sailing past the 60-fps premium gaming laptop average. Compared to the Aorus 17G which also has an RTX 3080 GPU it delivered 65 fps.



During the Grand Theft Auto V test the m17 R4 obtained 120 fps crushing the 89 fps average and the Aorus 17G 92 fps.



If anything this clearly shows the differing power of an RTX 3080 GPU. While both laptop GPUs displayed impressive frame rates the m17 R4 blew the Aorus 17G out of the park. The moral lesson of the day: read reviews before making that purchase.



Outlook

Nvidia's RTX 30-series has thrown a spanner in the works in terms of how powerful a laptop can be. No longer is it just the simplicity of 70 being better than 60 and so forth as each 30-series GPU distinctly offers different graphics and performance potential.

Smaller slower and more profitable. These are the watchwords for Chesapeake Energy as it emerges from bankruptcy. Free of the colossal liabilities that sank it as the pandemic slashed global energy demand last year the company has also abandoned the growth-at-all-costs strategy that made it a pioneer of the shale revolution — and poster child of the sector’s debt-fuelled excess.

Chesapeake’s market value will be a fraction of the $35bn it boasted more than a decade ago back when its controversial founder the late Aubrey McClendon was America’s best-paid chief executive and his company poured money into everything from Oklahoma real estate to an NBA arena. The new Chesapeake pledges to spend less than it brings in and return the excess to shareholders.

Outside the US oil and gas industry this wouldn’t sound radical. Within the business it is a departure. The only feature that matched shale’s disruptive rise in the past 15 years — more than doubling US oil and gas production and sharply reducing dependence on foreign oil supplies — was the industry’s unmatched knack for destroying investors’ money as hundreds of billions of dollars were spent with little return. Wall Street reacted by dumping its stocks making the sector one of the S&P 500’s smallest. When the worst oil crash in decades struck last year operators were forced to slash capital expenditure sack tens of thousands of workers idle rigs and cut production. Chesapeake’s Chapter 11 filing was just the most high-profile of scores of bankruptcies.

Now promise shale executives a more resilient industry is emerging from the ashes that aims to woo investors. Like the reincarnated Chesapeake it will be smaller — some analysts believe the sector will be reduced to just 10 dominant shale producers. Production increases will be modest and financed from cash flow. And activity will focus on fewer prolific shale fields mainly in Texas. Oil operators that feared new US president Joe Biden’s ambition to launch a green energy revolution would stymie the industry’s drilling and slow production growth now promise to do both themselves.

“I do believe we have a lot of proving to do to get investors back” says Vicki Hollub head of Occidental Petroleum which 18 months ago racked up $50bn in debt buying a rival producer in a deal now considered one of the most reckless gambles in the shale patch’s short history.

Cash flow and earnings growth must be the new priorities Ms Hollub says. “I believe that the watershed moment is here and our industry will I don’t think ever be the way we have been in the past.”

Can the industry’s new pitch be trusted? Some investors remain sceptical remembering how past promises of capital discipline crumbled when oil prices rose. “Give an oilman a dollar and he’ll drill a well” runs the old industry adage. In an era when environmental concerns are already deterring investment in fossil fuels and long-term growth in oil demand is no longer assured shale executives know they cannot risk breaking more promises.

“Why should investors trust it?” asks Matt Gallagher who headed Parsley Energy a shale producer acquired by larger operator Pioneer Natural Resources last year. “They shouldn’t.”

Early warning signs

After years of growth shale’s cash-intensive business model was running on fumes even before Saudi Arabia’s price war with Russia and the coronavirus pandemic crashed the oil market last year. The sector’s defining feature is the fast decline of each shale well’s production where output can drop by 80 per cent after just a year. To offset the loss another must be drilled. Then another to offset that well’s loss.

“In a shale play if you stop running you will fly off the back of the treadmill” says Raoul LeBlanc vice-president of energy at consultancy IHS Markit and former head of strategic planning at Anadarko Petroleum the company bought by Occidental in 2019. “Just to stay still you’ve got to do a lot of drilling.”

Operators drilled more than 14000 shale wells in 2019 according to Rystad an energy research company. It helped the US hit record-high oil output near 13m barrels a day a level unmatched even by Saudi Arabia and Russia the world’s next biggest producers.

That was a rise from 5m b/d just eight years earlier — a surge that sparked booms from Texas to North Dakota and helped drag the US economy out of the mire of the global financial crisis adding one percentage point to GDP between 2010 and 2015 according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. But it required huge infusions of cash offered at basement interest rates. Rystad says the sector spent around $400bn capital in those years but by 2019 free cash flow arrived only once in 2016.

“The fundamental problem with the shale model over the past decade has been the pursuit of growth over return on capital employed or returning capital to shareholders” says Ben Dell managing partner at Kimmeridge a private equity firm that has built up an activist position in the sector.

Investors that rushed to finance shale’s recovery from the 2014-15 price crash — an earlier Saudi price war to capture market share — were fleeing by 2019. As capital markets began to close for shale companies operators were forced to trim spending plans reducing new drilling activity. With profits still absent and growth prospects diminishing the shale patch entered 2020 in distress.

A reputation for flagrant corporate misgovernance and excess — from colossal executive bonuses earned by hitting oil output growth targets not profits to flashy office developments and rumours of company-funded hunting trips — didn’t help.

Then came last year’s price crash including the symbolic moment in April when West Texas Intermediate the country’s benchmark crude contract traded below zero for the first time. “Covid hits oil prices collapse everyone has to cut their capex valuations crash” says Aaron DeCoste an equity analyst at Boston Partners an institutional investor. “And it’s effectively reset the entire industry.”

Just a few shale companies showed they could survive the collapse last year in relative health says Mr Gallagher. From Chesapeake to scores of smaller producers the distress was acute with more than 100 operators and service providers with $102bn in debt going under according to a Rystad analysis from law firm Haynes and Boone.

“The ones that went wrong went way wrong” Mr Gallagher says. “What’s going on now is people are finding religion about the models that work.”

M&A rush

One tenet of the new shale “religion” is that scale is critical to survival — but of operators not the overall sector. The mergers and acquisitions to achieve adequate size coupled with the consolidation of weakened companies will continue to shrink the number of producers.

Lee Maginniss managing director at Alvarez & Marsal an advisory firm involved in oil industry restructuring says subscale producers will face “intense” pressure. From around 500 exploration and production companies in the US before the crash 50 may survive he says. Other analysts say just 10 or so dominant public shale companies will be left to run the best plays.

M&A activity is brisk with $52bn worth of deals done in the US oil sector last year according to Enverus a data provider. Chevron moved first buying Noble Energy in July. ConocoPhillips bought Concho Resources. Devon Energy merged with WPX Energy. Heavy debt battered balance sheets and weak equity valuations meant that stocks not cash were the currency in each deal.

Pierre Breber Chevron’s chief financial officer expects the consolidation wave to continue. “You need to have bigger players stronger players more disciplined management teams stronger balances sheets” he says. Scott Sheffield Pioneer’s chief executive says only companies with market capitalisation above $10bn will remain attractive to a value-focused investor base.

Scale will also allow them to compete with ExxonMobil and Chevron US majors which have built up commanding shale positions. Between them they intend to produce about 2m b/d from the Permian Basin later this decade — almost a fifth of total current US crude production.

Most of the M&A activity has occurred in that shale oilfield the world’s most prolific where operators will concentrate on the rich layers of oil-bearing rocks in the Delaware and Midland Basins of New Mexico and Texas. Gas-focused players such as the revamped Chesapeake are likely to stick to their best assets. Other shale fields even the Bakken of North Dakota that sparked the shale oil rush a decade ago will lose out.

“The heydays of the Bakken [Texas’s] Eagle Ford [Nebraska’s] Niobrara the Scoop Stack play in Oklahoma are all over” says Mr Sheffield referring to other shale fields in the US.

Capping output

But the main feature of the post-crash shale patch will be an era of tepid growth — if it expands at all. Rick Muncrief chief executive of Devon says his company can now break even at $30 a barrel or less well below the $50-plus for oil in recent weeks. Yet Devon will hold its rig count flat this year only drilling a few wells to meet the lease terms of some acreage.

“From publicly traded companies you’ll see a very measured response” says Mr Muncrief. US oil production is likely to fall by 200000-300000 b/d as a result he believes remaining around 11m b/d — well below the record highs set before last year’s crash.

“Are people going to return to growth? Is US shale going to grow? The answer is no” says Mr Sheffield. “Don’t anticipate a big ramp up in drilling people are not going to go back to the old ways.”

Even if oil prices hit $100 Mr Sheffield says his company would only increase output by 5 per cent a year — less than half the rate of average annual growth in total shale production between 2008 and the beginning of last year.

Analysts say this will be enforced by the market which has punished excessive supply growth — even before the pandemic hit last year — reducing oil and gas’s share of the S&P 500 almost to a footnote.

“The reason why energy is down to 2 per cent of the S&P 500 is because of that behaviour” says Mr Breber. Until the world has fully recovered it will not need shale producers to increase oil supply he says.

So far operators are holding the line. Rystad says third-quarter capital spending by the 39 main shale operators it covers was $3.6bn beneath cash flows from operations allowing a record 89 per cent of operators to balance their budgets. If the discipline sticks dividend- and value-focused investors could be lured back.

“I see attractive fundamentals that I haven’t seen for 20 years” says Mr DeCoste referring to the cheap valuations of some operators juxtaposed with expectations for higher oil prices. But he is cautious about the new capital discipline pledges: “It takes years to build your reputation and moments to destroy it.”

Prisoner’s dilemma

Despite the wave of consolidation other analysts and investors remain unconvinced by shale’s new mantra and more mature outlook saying operators will be unable to resist another supply surge if the recent price rally continues. “Gordon Gekko once said ‘greed is good’” says one adviser to shale operators. “In the oil patch that means ‘growth is good’.”

Chief executives are just “giving the audience what it wants to hear” says Art Berman a consultant and shale sceptic. Forgoing growth is “absolutely antithetical to the DNA of oil companies in general but shale companies in particular”.

Investors will be hesitant to take operators’ pledges on faith alone says Ms Hollub. “It’s going to be a ‘show me’ situation with them.”

Higher prices in recent weeks are already testing operators’ resolve. The weekly horizontal rig count hit 338 in mid-January more than 60 per cent above its low in August. Private operators which account for about 15 per cent of onshore US oil production have led the resurgence taking advantage of falling costs caused by the drop in demand for oilfield services from publicly listed companies.

“We can drill cheaper” says Wil VanLoh head of Quantum Energy Partners a large private equity shale investor referring to his portfolio companies. “By definition private capital is growth capital . . . we out-drill our cash flow until the time we get to positive free cash flow.”

It is the kind of message that public company bosses insisting they will not be drawn into another competitive drilling binge do not want to hear — especially as some analysts project more oil price increases. Goldman Sachs predicts Brent the international benchmark will rise to $65 a barrel by mid-year.

Rystad’s head of shale research Artem Abramov says he expects 2021 to “become the best year for the industry from the perspective of free cash flow generation”. It may even allow for profitability — and new production growth testing operators’ promises to investors.

At an average WTI price of just $52 a barrel this year — around the current price — the shale operators Rystad covers would rake in almost $41bn from operations. After capex commitments debt payments and more than $4bn returned to shareholders they would still have $8bn of net cash in hand. The question is what they do with it.

“I think they lose discipline and they probably bring on too much growth and damage the market again — like they did every year in the past” says Mr LeBlanc. “They’re in a prisoner’s dilemma. They never have discipline as a group because they’re all competing with each other.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Old Dominion University Women’s Lacrosse Head Coach Heather Holt (Radnor) announced her 2021 schedule this week. The Monarchs – featuring a host of Philly players – open the season on Feb. 12 at VCU and host William and Mary on Feb. 24 in the home opener.

Also Holt named three additional co-captains this week – two from Philly Dani Dundas (Central Bucks West) and Lilly Siskind (Henderson).



“Under the current circumstances our staff has worked very hard to put together a very competitive schedule for the 2021 season” Holt said. “Our team has been focusing on staying healthy and safe while practicing and competing every day.

“This season will present several challenges that we have never faced on and off the field yet I am confident my team is prepared for anything. This is one of the most talented teams I have coached at ODU and I look forward to a successful season.”



Siskind had 14 goals in 9 games last year as a sophomore. Dundas had 6 goals as a sophomore.

“Along with Brooke Frey and Madison Corcoran I have named three additional captains Dani Dundas Claire Porter and Lilly Siskind to the 2021 Team” Holt said.

“These three student athletes have demonstrated strong leadership qualities on and off the field this semester and the team has naturally gravitated towards them during these unprecedented times.

“I am rewarding their hard work by adding them to our leadership positions and look forward to their continued contributions this season.”

Although Turner and Postorino enjoyed only two winning seasons in their four years consistent winning followed in Purnell’s last four seasons.

For the most part that has been the case in the last two decades. Dayton has experienced only two losing seasons in this century.

“It feels good to be a part of that” Turner said. “That moved Dayton back in the right direction. That was one of the reasons I wanted to go to Dayton: to be a part of something special.”

Turner now 43 left his mark as an individual as well. He ranks 47th in school history with 1025 points. He still holds the single-season school record for 3-point accuracy. As a junior he made 61 of 118 3-pointers (51.7 percent).

Turner grew up in Alexandria Va. and now lives about 40 miles south in Stafford Va. He’s a training specialist in human resources and employee relations for WGL Holdings a public utility company which provides electricity and natural gas throughout the region. He’s worked there for 14 years.

Turner’s current career followed a pro basketball career that included a stint with the Houston Rockets in the NBA Summer League after his senior season in 1999 and then three-plus seasons overseas in Luxembourg Belgium Argentina and the Dominican Republic. His career ended in part because of an abdominal muscle injury.

“I got home and my intention was to rehab and get stronger and go back over” Turner said “but after a while of being away from the game I said ‘Hey I’m going to go into the workforce.’ It was a great opportunity to see the world and make some money. I have no regrets.”

Turner now has a 20-year-old son Rodney and two daughters: Corina 14 and Giana 12. He remains a big fan of the Flyers. Last season he saw Dayton beat Davidson to clinch the Atlantic 10 Conference championship and experienced the renovated UD Arena for the first time. It was the first time he had seen the Flyers play at home since his senior year though he often sees them on the road in Virginia or elsewhere on the East Coast.

Like other Flyers who follow the team from afar Turner praised the job fellow alum Anthony Grant has done in four seasons.

“It’s great that a UD alum has come back and led the program in the right direction” Turner said. “He’s proven to be the right man for the job.”

The same was true for Purnell 26 years ago. Turner got to know Purnell by attending basketball camps at Old Dominion University when Purnell was the coach there from 1991-94.

“I didn’t start playing basketball until the eighth or ninth grade” Turner said. “The first camp I’d ever gone to the only camp I’d ever gone to was at Old Dominion. He was there from the very beginning of my basketball development. He recruited me to Old Dominion and it just carried on to Dayton.”

Turner originally committed to Boston College but changed his mind on the last day of the spring signing period in April 1995. At that time Turner was attending Hargrave Military Academy a prep school in Chatham Va. after graduating from Robert E. Lee High School in Springfield Va. in 1994.

“I chose the University of Dayton because I feel there is a great opportunity for me to come right in and play with a program that’s trying to make a turnaround” Turner told the Dayton Daily News in 1994. “I feel I will be a big part of that.”

A broken hand set Turner back in his freshman season. He had four metal screws placed in the hand during surgery in October and missed the first two games. He says now he should have redshirted that season because the hand bothered him throughout the season even though he was cleared to play. He re-injured the hand in January but missed only one game.

“I couldn’t move my left hand couldn’t catch the ball” Turner said. “My hand would swell up. I couldn’t dribble with my left hand and if anyone’s seen me play even though I’m right-handed I love going left. That hurt me a lot.”

Turner averaged 6.6 points and started 17 games as a sophomore as Dayton slipped to 13-14 in Purnell’s third season. Then in the 1997-98 season Turner and the Flyers improved in a big way. Dayton finished 21-12 and made its first postseason appearance since 1990 reaching the second round of the NIT.

“The 1997-98 basketball season will be remembered fondly by University of Dayton fans” wrote Bucky Albers of the Dayton Daily News after Dayton lost 77-74 to Penn State in the NIT that March. “It was a season when they could wear their UD sweatshirts stick out their chests and be proud of the team that represented them. It was a season that brought back warm memories for those old enough to remember the days when UD nearly always had strong teams.”

Turner averaged 13.3 points and started all 33 games. He won the Chris Daniels Award as the A-10′s most-improved player. The award was named after his former teammate. Daniels died in his sleep of cardiac arrhythmia during Turner’s freshman season.

“That’s probably my fondest award I’ve ever received” Turner said. “He took me under his wing like a big brother. We were really close. I just remember him always giving me encouraging words.”

Turner still has that award as well as a trophy he received for being the NCAA’s best 3-point shooter that season. He credited his improvement to being healthy.

“What I remember is how well that team jelled together” he said. “We really felt we were going to get a bid into the NCAA tournament. We certainly earned it.”

An injury during his senior year kept Turner from having the same kind of success. He averaged 9.7 points and the Flyers finished 11-17. The abdominal muscle injury that plagued him later in his pro career started hurting him then. He would spend hours at UD Arena before games getting treatment.

Turner’s health improved late in the season and he played some of his best basketball. He scored 20 points in a 91-86 victory against rival Xavier at UD Arena.

“The Cobra’s back” teammate Edwin Young said after that game. “And he put some venom in Xavier.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbGF3YWl0cy5jb20vMjU2MDk4MS9nbG9iZS1hei1iZXN0LXRoaW5ncy10by1kby_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Best Things To Do In Globe,"Globe Arizona is a small-town jewel located about an hour and a half east of the Phoenix metro area. Its name perfectly reflects its mining past.

The name Globe is said to have originated with a globe-shaped nugget of silver that was found near the townsite in the 1800s. The legacy of that inspired name has endured through Globe’s founding in the 1870s its mining heyday in the early 1900s and its current status as a charming town along Arizona’s scenic Salt River Canyon Scenic Route.

I had driven the scenic highway a few times over my several decades of living in Arizona but had never stopped in Globe the largest of the little towns located along the route. I finally decided to explore it on a recent road trip and what I found was a community rich with mining history local art and prehistoric Native American ruins — all amidst a fun small-town atmosphere and a robust regional cuisine scene.

Globe makes for a great road trip from the Phoenix area by taking Highway 60 in the East Valley and through the towns of Superior Miami and Claypool.

Here are nine ideas for spending a perfect day in Globe.

1. Walk The Historic Downtown

As you drive into Globe you are sure to spot the “Historic Downtown Globe” sign emblazoned across an old railroad trestle. A turn toward Broad Street beneath the underpass will take you right into the heart of Globe — an ideal place to begin or end your day.

I recommend parking in one of the ample spaces along the hilly streets of the downtown area and getting out for a walk.

A stroll on Broad Street the main drag will take you past numerous retro storefronts such as La Luz Del Dia Mexican restaurant which sports an adorable coffee-cup sign as well as the beautiful old Gila County Courthouse that now serves as an arts center.

Other historic buildings in Globe offer a glimpse into the soul of early-Arizona culture — from the 1910 Jail building complete with barred windows to the 1918 Holy Angels Church that features stained glass windows designed by one of America’s foremost stained-glass artists.

2. Take In The Local Art Scene At Cobre Valley Center For The Arts

One-of-a-kind design touches will grab your attention upon entering the old Gila County Courthouse in downtown Globe. Built in 1906 the Italian Renaissance-style building includes features such as burnished copper stair rails high ceilings painted a sky blue and elegant arches.

While the building is a stunner the local art that it houses is equally compelling. After serving as the county courthouse until the 1970s the historic building later was converted into the Cobre Valley Center for the Arts and is Globe’s (and its sister community Miami’s) hub for fine arts music theater arts and quilts.

Along with the fine art exhibits the center offers a gift shop that sells local art jewelry Apache crafts books and pottery.

Pro Tip: Ask for a tour of the upper levels where you’ll find local favorites such as the Governor’s Room with portraits of two Arizona Governors who hailed from Globe and a performance stage that once served as a courtroom.

3. Step Into Prehistoric Times

The ancient Salado people occupied the Globe area nearly 800 years ago and today visitors can walk in their footsteps at the 200-room prehistoric pueblo known as Besh-Ba-Gowah.

The pueblo which consists of partially restored ruins is located one mile southwest of Globe. Besh-Ba-Gowah is the name that the Apache people gave to the early settlement of Globe. Roughly translated it means “place of metal” says the town’s website. The ruins the site adds offer a look into the lifestyle of the people who occupied the region more than two centuries before Columbus arrived in the “New World.”

Along with the ruins the Besh-Ba-Gowah includes a museum with a collection of Salado pottery and artifacts botanical gardens and a gift shop.

Pro Tip: Another chance to see the Salado culture is available nearby by heading northwest of Globe to the Tonto National Monument where you will find two well-preserved cliff dwellings left by the Salado people who lived in the Tonto Basin between the years 1250 and 1450.

4. Drive The Salt River Canyon Scenic Route

For an exciting drive complete with twists turns and magnificent views check out the Salt River Canyon Scenic Route — a route that drops more than 2000 feet into a deep and rugged river canyon and then continues up the other side.

From the Phoenix area the drive progresses east on Highway 60 through Superior and Globe before heading northeast toward the mountain town of Show Low. The most spectacular section is about 40 miles northeast of Globe near the Salt River Canyon Rest Stop.

Pro Tip: For ideas on other things to do along the scenic route see my story on the nine best stops driving the scenic Salt River Canyon.

5. Lunch On Authentic Mexican Cuisine

An internet search of Mexican restaurants in Globe will turn up about 10 different establishments in this town of just over 7000 people. Most of the restaurants are run by local families each of which has its own Mexican-cuisine specialty.

El Ranchito which is known to be among the best specializes in Mexican classics such as tamales and green chili enchiladas while Los Robertos Mexican Food offers fresh fast-food Mexican selections like burritos and tortas (Mexican sandwiches) and La Luz Del Dia features a diner atmosphere in the downtown area and offers breakfast and lunch selections such as burritos and quesadillas as well as bakery items like cookies and Mexican bread.

6. Shop The Southwest At Pickle Barrel Trading Post

Name a Southwestern-style art craft or souvenir and you can probably find it at the Pickle Barrel Trading Post. The store is packed with beautiful displays of turquoise jewelry Native American woven baskets Southwest-themed foods vintage collectibles and colorful blankets.

The trading post occupies a 1905-era building constructed as a warehouse for the Old Dominion Mine. By the 1990s work was underway to convert the historic building into an antique shop and the current owners acquired it in the early 2000s. Today shoppers can wander from room to room inside the shop and step out onto the beautiful multi-leveled patios to see the creative metal art.

Simply perusing the historic building and the enormous assortment of beautiful Southwest goods is worth a stop even if you’re not in the market for a Pendleton blanket or metal saguaro cactus.

7. Take A High Desert Hike

For stellar views of Globe in its desert/mountain setting stop at Round Mountain Park where six hiking routes await.

The city park offers everything from easy jaunts to moderately strenuous climbs. For the best views of Globe nearby Miami and the surrounding mountain ranges check out the East or West trails which both head to the summit of Round Mountain. Both hikes have gradual climbs and are considered moderate. The trails are grouped in loops of up to three miles each.

8. Visit A Historic Copper Mining Camp

From the 1880s through the early 1930s copper extracted from the Old Dominion Mine was the driving force for the development in the Globe-Miami area according to the town’s website.

While the mine and the town both thrived during the 1910s the Old Dominion never returned to its former glory after World War I and it was permanently closed in 1931.

Today after more than a decade of work the old mine has been transformed into the Old Dominion Historic Mine Park where visitors can walk along trails named for mining claims like the Silver Nugget visit a “boneyard” of historic mining artifacts and picnic under shady pavilions.

9. Dine Al Fresco At Bravo

Housed in a rustic brick building along Globe’s Broad Street Bravo Americano Moderno offers a modern take on European classics.

Featuring a wood-fire oven Bravo’s standout is its pizza which comes to your table with a nicely charred crust and a range of creative toppings. I loved the basic margherita pizza but there is also the Arugula Arugula Arugula (garlic oil hard salami fresh mozzarella red onion sun dried tomatoes and yes arugula) or the Toscana (fresh feta Parmigiano Italian fennel sausage mushrooms red onions green olives and sliced tomatoes). Or try one of Bravo’s decadent appetizers like the buttery garlic lobster ravioli.

One of the best features of Bravo is its beautiful patio with an outdoor bar and tables grouped around fire pits — a lovely spot for an evening meal.

Other places worth checking out for dinner are Nurd Berger with its large selection of burgers and American cuisine and Bloom Asian Concept Restaurant with fare from Japan China Vietnam Singapore and Malaysia.

Pro Tip

The best seasons to visit Globe are fall winter and spring. Winter months of December through February feature average high temperatures around 60 Fahrenheit while fall and spring have highs in the 70s and 80s. Summer tends to be hot in Globe with average highs well into the 90s in June July and August.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9waWxvdG9ubGluZS9uYW1lL3JvYmVydC1taWRnZXR0LW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTEyNTQxMzI40gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Robert Midgett Obituary (1959 - 2021) - Norfolk VA - The Virginian-Pilot,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/pilotonline/name/robert-midgett-obituary?id=12541328 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9waWxvdG9ubGluZS9uYW1lL3JvYmVydC1taWRnZXR0LW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTEyNTQxMzI40gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jaW5lbWFibGVuZC5jb20vbmV3cy8yNTYyMTU2L2hvdy1qdXJhc3NpYy13b3JsZC1kb21pbmlvbnMtamVmZi1nb2xkYmx1bS1oaWxhcmlvdXNseS1kcm92ZS1zYW0tbmVpbGwtYW5kLXRoZS1jYXN0LWNyYXp5LWV2ZXJ5LWRhedIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Jurassic World: Dominion's Jeff Goldblum Hilariously Drove Sam Neill And The Cast 'Crazy Every Day',"Haven’t you heard? Life finds a way. And that’s a mantra that helped the third Jurassic World movie move along through its near-year production stacked with production halts brought on by COVID-19. Jurassic World: Dominion is coming next summer and we’re especially hyped to see Jeff Goldblum Sam Neill and Laura Dern officially enter the storyline fronted by Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard’s roles. Of course this also came with Goldblum's unique personality which humorously drove the cast and crew crazy for one particular reason.

Jeff Goldblum is a one-of-a-kind delight who is known for some of the most memorable moments in the original Jurassic Park. While Sam Neill recalled being on the set of Dominion this past year he talked about working with his old friends and of course Goldblum’s pizazz came up. In his words:

Colin Trevorrow who's a lovely guy and a really good director he was very open to suggestions. Jeff would come to work with about 50 suggestions that drive us crazy every day god bless him. I love Jeff but boy does he have a lot of ideas! Laura and I would come up with things as well and Collin was very open to that. We'll see how many of those things make it to the cut!

Sounds about right. Jeff Goldblum is known for his high-energy and passion for his work so it doesn’t surprise us that he came to the Jurassic World set bright-eyed and ready to offer any and all suggestions he could think of. It sounds like Dominion was a quite collaborative film that Goldblum Neill and Dern all contributed to!

Neill’s words to ET are a great reminder of how pumped we are to see Dr. Ian Malcolm again along with Dr. Ellie Satler and Neill's own Dr. Alan Grant. The original trio is an unforgettable one and they must have had some input into what they and the fans might want to see from their characters next. We’ve already seen a sneak peek of the three actors on the set such as this pic the actor shared on Instagram:

A photo posted by on

Goldblum also re-enacted his famed shirtless moment from the original movie after enticing fans to register to vote during U.S. election season. The actor looks like he’s going for a slick and straight silver fox hairdo for his return as Ian Malcolm instead of reprising his dark curls of the ‘90s. It’s a good look for the 68-year-old actor as Dominion seemingly wraps up the most recent era of Jurassic movies.

Colin Trevorrow returned to direct Dominion after stepping away for Fallen Kingdom recently admitting he really loves the experience of working on the movies and wanted to continue the saga following directing the first Jurassic World. Last we caught up with Pratt’s Grady dinos had run rampant around the world and he’ll likely need Malcolm Satler and Grant to protect humankind from being overrun by the prehistoric creatures.

Jurassic World: Dominion heads to theaters on June 10 2022. While we wait to see these ideas come to life on the big screen check out all the movies expected to come this year with CinemaBlend’s 2021 release schedule."

Total sales were $439 billion the SIA said in a statement. China was again the largest consumer of the electronic components with its market growing 5% to $152 billion. The Americas region surged 20% to $94 billion. Sales into Europe dropped 6%.



Semiconductor makers benefitt ed from employers and parents buying laptops and other devices for remote work. Beneath that positive trend though geopolitical fissures continued to stress the global technology supply chain.

U.S. companies accounted for 47% of total sales last year maintaining the country’s status as home to the biggest chip companies. But the amount of manufacturing in the U.S. continues to decline. Just 12% of chip production was done in U.S. factories in 2020 down from 37% in 1990.



“That disparity will only intensify without U.S. government action to level the global playing field” SIA Chief Executive Officer John Neuffer said. “It’s imperative the federal government fully fund incentives for domestic chip manufacturing and investments in chip research so the U.S. can benefit from growing demand and produce more semiconductors needed to strengthen our economy national security and critical infrastructure.”

The chip industry has become ensnared in the trade war between China and the U.S. Beijing has vowed to spend more than $160 billion to create a domestic semiconductor sector and limit the ability of the U.S. to hammer companies such as Huawei Technologies Co. with supply limits in the name of national security.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vYXNpYS5uaWtrZWkuY29tL0J1c2luZXNzL1RlY2gvU2VtaWNvbmR1Y3RvcnMvVFNNQy1zLWJldC1vbi1nbG9iYWwtZG9taW5hbmNlLXBheXMtb2ZmLWFmdGVyLWRlY2FkZXMtb2YtcGxhbm5pbmfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,TSMC's bet on global dominance pays off after decades of planning,"TAIPEI/TOKYO -- With the global shortage of semiconductors becoming ever more serious Taiwanese Economic Minister Wang Mei-hua held an unusual meeting with executives from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. on Jan. 24 to relay a plea from numerous foreign governments.

The company still has a solid domain over the Chinese market and even achieved good results in markets as Russia. However the future is quite uncertain now that the brand lost access to its Kirin chipset division. Recently the Ban prohibited TSMC from dealing with the brand. Without the semiconductor company chips Huawei couldn’t keep its Kirin chipsets coming. Now the brand needs to rely on third-party chipsets from other manufacturers. This advancement has exposed a critical situation in the Chinese smartphone business. So far there isn’t a solid semiconductor industry in China that can make cutting-edge chips to compete. However this is set to change in the coming years.

According to information released by China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) 90 companies have filed a joint application for the establishment of the National Integrated Circuit Standardization Technical Committee. It has a proposed secretariat at the China Electronics Standardization Institute.

The 90 companies will work to strengthen the Chinese Semiconductor Industry

As aforementioned China’s semiconductor Industry is one of the weak links in electronics manufacture. The recent ban on Huawei and ZTE from accessing US technology exposed the vulnerability of the local chip market. These companies had ways to bypass software and related restrictions. However they couldn’t find a proper chip solution in their local market to keep the business flourishing. Even semiconductor companies like SMIC that were making effort to fill the void created by the ban were prevented from accessing US technology. Furthermore most of the foundries are either small-scale or weak in technology so they need to cooperate in groups.

The purpose behind the creation of the committee is to coordinate weak industries and the promotion of integrated circuit standardization work. It also aims to strengthen the standardization team building. So far 90 Chinese firms are part of the consortium.

Notices pinned to bulletin boards throughout the plant in the days prior alerted workers to that much.

That day a Dixie executive from Atlanta was in town. She met with the workers’ union leaders at 7:15 a.m. — 15 minutes after the plant’s third shift ends and its first shift begins — and delivered the news. Then at 7:30 a.m. she spoke to more than 150 employees sitting in chairs separated by 6 feet — a reminder of the pandemic that had chilled demand for the facility’s products. Those who couldn’t attend were notified with a phone call after.

Just after 9 a.m. corporate parent Georgia-Pacific released the news publicly: It was closing its longtime Dixie cup manufacturing plant in Forks Township by the end of 2021 putting 190 people out of work and relocating some of the operation’s equipment to an existing site in Kentucky.

“I was taken by surprise” said Dennis Andrews a printing operator who has worked at the plant for 23 years and four months. “In hindsight you could say there were signs but everybody’s good with hindsight. For me this came out of left field.”

Andrews as financial secretary of United Steelworkers Local 412 heard the news at 7:15 a.m. and then again with the rest of the plant 15 minutes later when he stood in the back while the executive spoke through a microphone. He couldn’t tell you much of what she said at the larger meeting — his hearing isn’t all that good after years running the printing press that stamps designs on the Dixie cups.

What’s clear is the closure will be gradual and effects bargaining between Georgia-Pacific and the union will begin Feb. 8 Andrews said.

Georgia-Pacific will close its Lehigh Valley manufacturing plant in Forks Township by the end of the year the company announced Jan. 15. The plant which sits off Kesslersville Road makes cups under the Dixie name.

The first cuts will come between March 25 and April 7 when 16 hourly employees and one salaried worker will lose their jobs according to a Jan. 21 notice filed with the state to comply with the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act.

Fifty-seven more — 51 hourly six salaried — will be let go between July 21 and Aug. 3. The final 116 workers which includes 104 hourly and 12 salaried employees needed to close the plant and decommission the facility’s assets will lose their jobs sometime between Dec. 15 and Dec. 28.

Wind-downs like this have happened in the Lehigh Valley and beyond before of course ? the decision made by a corporate parent based elsewhere that sees declining demand and opts to consolidate operations to reduce costs and keep pace with rivals. Those plants often were longtime employment hubs places where generations of the same family spent their careers. That was the case at the Forks plant which dates to 1964 and is just one part of Dixie’s long history in the Lehigh Valley.

The pandemic by minimizing public gatherings halting events and forcing many office employees to work from home cut into sales for paper cups and opened the door for Georgia-Pacific to relocate operations under one roof as it attempts to bolster its competitive stance in the industry.

“We’ve seen a decrease in consumption as we’ve all transitioned to how we’re living in the last few months” Georgia-Pacific spokesperson Tom Strother explained. “At the end of the day decisions like this are difficult to make. This was a strategic decision we made based upon the needs of our business and our ability to be competitive long term.”

Or as Andrews said as he tried to make sense of it all: “This is just the numbers. This is all just numbers.”

But in the Lehigh Valley overflowing with industrial activity economic development leaders expressed confidence the Dixie property will be in high demand when it closes. And with many employers in the sector struggling to find talent the hope is many Dixie workers will land on their feet once they are let go.

When state Sen. Lisa Boscola heard Georgia-Pacific was closing its Forks manufacturing plant her mind flashed back to a 1999 tour of the facility when it was part of the Fort James Corp.

She remembers that Friday afternoon in August as an exciting day when Fort James touted a $14 million 48-job expansion at its Dixie plant as the company rushed to meet demand for a then-revolutionary product: a disposable cup made of plastic-coated paper that kept coffee hot without scorching the consumer’s hands. McDonald’s was among the big buyers of the cup called the PerfecTouch. The company sent Boscola home with some of its cups that day.

“My husband and I thought they were pretty cool” said Boscola whose district no longer includes the Forks facility. “I remember having those cups in my house and thinking ‘This is so great to have in the Lehigh Valley.'”

The state chipped in $275000 in grants to support that expansion with Fort James planning to use almost half of the 350000-square-foot Forks plant to produce PerfecTouch cups. At the same time the company also invested $14 million to equip its Darlington South Carolina plant to make the cups.

Less than one year later Georgia-Pacific Corp. then better known for its forest and building products announced it was acquiring Fort James for $7.8 billion in cash and stock plus the assumption of $3.5 billion in debt. The deal closed Nov. 27 2000 a major step in the Atlanta company’s push to transform itself into the holder of more consumer name brands such as Quilted Northern Brawny and Dixie.

Analysts at the time predicted few changes for the 450 employees making Dixie cups paper plates and disposable forks knives and spoons at the Forks plant. But the acquisition of Fort James also loaded Georgia-Pacific up with more debt and the company spent the next few years reducing its debt from a peak of $16 billion to $8.7 billion by the end of 2004.

By November 2005 Georgia-Pacific had a deal in place to go private: Koch Industries Inc. was buying the company for $13.2 billion plus the assumption of $7.8 billion in Georgia-Pacific debt.

At that time the Forks plant employed 386 people Morning Call archives show.

Koch Industries based in Wichita Kansas and one of the largest private companies in the United States still owns Georgia-Pacific today.

Under Koch Andrews said the Forks operation’s employment slowly slimmed down over the years. That continued a trend at the site considering the plant once employed 525 and was Northampton County’s 13th-largest employer in 1996 before the 1997 merger of James River Corp. and Fort Howard Corp.

Thinking about the plant now reminds Andrews of the conversations he had when he started there in the late 1990s. The old-timers as he called them would tell him: “Dennis this isn’t like it was.”

Andrews whose previous job was nonunion didn’t think it was so bad.

But now with the plant getting ready to close?

“I find myself as one of the old-timers saying the exact same thing” he said.

What happened?

Andrews usually would take overtime at the plant when it was available. But when the coronavirus pandemic hit in March overtime dried up in the printing department. In fact production at the plant shut down for a few weeks last year as demand slowed for the Dixie to Go/PerfecTouch cup and the snap-on lids.

“As a private company we don’t publish specific production information” said Strother the company spokesperson. “However there has been a decrease in volume some of which is attributable to the global pandemic.”

Industry analysts said paper cup volume has been hit hard especially with many office employees still working from home and no longer picking up their daily cup of joe-to-go. Also Dixie’s PerfecTouch cup is often used in car dealerships repair shops doctor’s offices and other spots where coffee is available to people waiting or working said Charles Gross a senior equity analyst with Morningstar who covers the paper packaging industry including many of Georgia-Pacific’s big competitors.

“Unfortunately closures throughout the U.S. have sharply dried up foot traffic at those ‘water coolers'” said Gross who covers International Paper WestRock and Packaging Corp. of America.

Though the paper packaging business as a whole is steadily growing Gross noted there will be winners and losers in the industry. He also has concerns about long-term demand for disposable products that can be hard to recycle such as the PerfecTouch cup as consumers increasingly focus on sustainable items.

While it’s true that demand is down longtime packaging and forest products analyst Mark Wilde thinks there is more to Georgia-Pacific’s decision to close its Forks plant. Wilde covered Georgia-Pacific when it was a public company and now analyzes Pactiv Evergreen and Graphic Packaging International which also produce paper cups.

“I would be a bit surprised if this short-term issue was the only factor behind the Georgia-Pacific decision” said Wilde of BMO Capital Markets Equity Research. “I think they are always looking at their manufacturing footprint for ways to reduce cost.”

While market conditions matter Strother said Georgia-Pacific also believes having all Dixie cup manufacturing under one roof in Lexington Kentucky will allow it to stay competitive. Once the Forks plant closes all Dixie cups including premium hot cups recycled fiber cups and bath cups will be made at the 550000-square-foot Lexington facility that employs 230 people.

Gross said Georgia-Pacific’s peers also have consolidated facilities over the last decade.

“Ultimately most of these products can be considered ‘commodities’ and it’s a constant race to lower your costs faster than the competition” he said. “Consolidating locations can reduce overhead costs like property taxes or operating lease costs and typically allows some reduction in headcount — one fewer person managing the front desk and fewer accountants and managers per unit of production.”

With work moving to Lexington Georgia-Pacific is planning to add about 50 jobs at that plant. Mike Watson president of Teamsters Local 651 which represents the Lexington workers said the union has started conversations to see if any existing Forks employees want to transfer.

While the company said 230 people work at the Lexington plant Watson said that’s likely including nonunion employees since the Teamsters no longer has that many members at the facility following some cutbacks in the last couple years.

“This announcement that they were closing Lehigh … quite frankly I thought it was going to go the opposite way” Watson said. “We are happy here to a degree because we’re going to get 50 more jobs is what they’re telling me.”

It surprised Andrews too.

He said Georgia-Pacific rolled out a new computer system at the Forks plant in October a technological upgrade that helped the facility better track product and do inventory. He took that as a sign that the company was reinvesting.

Strother said Georgia-Pacific is implementing new business systems at all of its consumer products manufacturing sites which included the Lehigh Valley plant late last year.

Then after all of those months with no extra work available Andrews said he got a weekend of overtime in January.

“I thought things were turning around” he said.

What now?

To Don Cunningham the situation at the Forks facility feels familiar in a way.

He likened it to what unfolded more than five years ago when the Lehigh Valley learned that the longtime Kraft plant would close in Upper Macungie Township costing 415 people their jobs as part of a larger corporate downsizing.

After the Kraft plant closed in November 2016 the property was sold just months later to an Atlanta developer that demolished the plant and built two industrial buildings now a 1.5 million-square-foot manufacturing warehouse and distribution operation for Keurig Dr Pepper.

Cunningham president and CEO of the Lehigh Valley Economic Development Corp. said two manufacturing companies looking to enter the Lehigh Valley market have already expressed interest in Georgia-Pacific’s plant in Forks. In addition he said several area employers hungry for talent are eager to hire any displaced Dixie workers.

“There’s a lot of interest already” Cunningham said. “I just hope the timing lines up.”

For Georgia-Pacific which owns the nearly 36-acre property at 605 Kuebler Road Strother said the company will decide what’s next for the property toward the end of 2021 after cup-making operations have ended.

As for the affected workers like Andrews time will tell what’s next.

Andrews found out recently that his job as a printing operator is going to last until December so he’ll be among the last group of employees to exit the building where he started as a general laborer 23 years and four months ago.

Born and raised in Easton Andrews bought a house in Wilson a year ago and just turned 60 years old. The thought of not having a job is scary he admitted and he’s got another five years or so of work left in his career.

Whatever comes next he said: “It will be union work I guarantee you.”

Now one of the plant’s old-timers he’ll remember the people he worked alongside at the Dixie plant. He’ll remember how they helped one another. He’ll remember how multiple generations of the same family worked at the plant over the years. His aunt and uncle in fact retired from the facility.

“Everyone was there to do a job and it got done and everyone was happy” he said.

But now in 2021 each of the plant’s 190 employees will eventually do their job in Forks one final time. Their last task will occur in March April July August or December and then they’ll leave behind the facility with a giant Dixie cup planted out front.

But it still arrived before privacy could get there.

A trio of researchers from China have found that QUIC is more vulnerable to web fingerprinting than HTTPS a shortcoming that could make it easier for an adversary to infer which websites an individual is visiting by scrutinizing network traffic.

Boffins Pengwei Zhan and Liming Wang of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Yi Tang of Guangzhou University funded by China’s National Key R&D Program describe their findings in a paper distributed via ArXiv.

The paper ""Website Fingerprinting on Early QUIC Traffic"" has been submitted to Elsevier Computer Networks.

TCP and UDP the paper explains are two networking protocols in the TCP/IP suite. TCP has some limitations in certain situations like head of line blocking and retransmission ambiguity. Google developed QUIC to solve issues like these and the protocol is being worked on in parallel by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) as a standard. About five per cent of websites currently support QUIC according to the paper and Chromium-based browsers will try QUIC first before falling back to HTTPS if QUIC is unavailable.

QUIC! IETF sets November deadline for last comments on TCP-killer spawned by Google and Cloudflare READ MORE

""QUIC is a UDP-based cryptographic protocol with built-in TLS function and optimized multiplexing flow control and congestion control mechanism which solves TCP transmission performance shortcomings"" the paper says. ""QUIC which is equal to HTTP+TLS+UDP can achieve the same or better transmission efficiency as HTTPS (equal to HTTP+TLS+TCP) in most network conditions and provides security equivalent to TLS.""

But HTTPS the researchers found remains more resistant to web fingerprinting. Web fingerprinting in this context is not browser/device fingerprinting which captures browser-based data points like browser type device brand screen size and so on and uses those to calculate a hash identifier. Rather it refers to data extracted by sniffing network traffic between internet users and the websites they visit.

Web fingerprinting of this sort involves eavesdropping on people's encrypted network traffic – the contents of which remain protected – and using the observed packets to build distinct patterns that correspond with specific websites. The attack measures characteristics like packet size packet order total transmission size and other metrics. The researchers define some of these characteristics as Simple features – eight general packet size categories – and others as Transfer features – e.g. packet order.

This network data forms the basis for a model that can subsequently be used to predict which websites are being visited the sort of thing say a censorious government might wish to do.

The boffins claim that the maximum attack accuracy on QUIC is about 57 per cent which is 73 per cent higher than on HTTPS. By using ""early traffic"" – the initial packets being exchanged – they claim QUIC attack accuracy can reach about 95 per cent with only 40 packets and Simple features compared to about 60 per cent attack accuracy for HTTPS.

The researchers caution that their experiments were conducted in an environment where the traffic quality was pure and that real world network conditions may lead to different results. But they remain dubious about QUIC's capacity for privacy.

""The superior transmission performance of the QUIC protocol brings opportunities for speeding up the Internet but its security risks bring uncertainties"" the boffins conclude. ""...The vulnerability of QUIC on early traffic poses a significant challenge to the privacy and confidentiality guaranteed."" ®",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vc2lsaWNvbmFuZ2xlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzAxLzMxL2ZvdXIta2V5LWRyaXZlcnMtd2lsbC1jYXVzZS10ZWNoLXNwZW5kaW5nLXJvYXItYmFjay0yMDIxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,These four key drivers will cause tech spending to roar back in 2021,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://siliconangle.com/2021/01/31/four-key-drivers-will-cause-tech-spending-roar-back-2021/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vc2lsaWNvbmFuZ2xlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzAxLzMxL2ZvdXIta2V5LWRyaXZlcnMtd2lsbC1jYXVzZS10ZWNoLXNwZW5kaW5nLXJvYXItYmFjay0yMDIxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

Credit cards have been a stable shopping companion for billions of people worldwide for a very long time. It was a tremendous 20th-century innovation. However in the last few years the credit card as a payment option has seen increasingly more competition for market share from new and innovative payment models.

The Buy Now Pay Later (or BNPL) option is one of them. Also called deferred payment or the ‘Shop Now Pay Later’ method the BNPL model has been around for a little over a decade now. It is currently one of the biggest ‘threats’ to the traditional credit card payment model as more and more users shift to the BNPL model.

This article will look into why it is becoming increasingly popular by analyzing its benefits to consumers and retailers. We will also look at the risks of this payment model.

What is Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL)?

Definition Buy Now Pay Later apps are financial tools that make it easier for shoppers to access credit for goods bought. They allow the user to shop often at no extra cost or a fraction of the cost of using other payment methods such as credit cards. BNPL apps integrate seamlessly with merchant stores allowing the shoppers to carry on their activities easily and settling the bill offsite with the deferred payment provider. The shopper can then pay for items received in multiple installments later.

Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) Business Model Explained

Here’s an example from Revelry a wedding outfit e-commerce store that has integrated Klarna as a payment option.

An example from Revelry a wedding outfit e-commerce store.

The ‘Rosalie Tulle Convertible’ dress in this example costs $185. However shoppers using Klarna (one of the largest BNPL service providers) can defer the entire payment or split it into four equal installments of $46.25.

You’ll notice that the total amount for split payments in this case equals the cost price. This is because Klarna similar to most Buy Now Pay Later apps never charges interest to the shoppers for using the service. Albeit this is conditional as we will cover below.

It is easy to see the appeal that these BNPL services have in the marketplace. As opposed to using credit cards shoppers can use BNPL apps to purchase an item but choose to pay for it later.

But this is not like a hire purchase where you get to own the product after making the last installment. With Buy Now Pay Later services you receive the item upon checkout.

The retailer receives payment immediately just as they do if the customer pays using a credit card.

Essentially the BNPL apps are a credit card solution adapted for 21st-century shoppers. They attempt to circumvent the shortcomings of credit cards.

The Benefits of Buy Now Pay Later Apps

We can split the benefits for BNPL service providers into two categories: benefits to consumers and retailers. Expectedly the retailers and consumers have different goals and BNPL apps appeal to each segment differently.

Benefits of BNPL Apps to Consumers

Deferred payments – this is the most significant advantage of using these BNPL apps. By deferring your payment you can keep your money longer and hopefully make it work for you. Additionally with these apps you can buy more stuff with the same amount of money. Risk-free purchases – let’s face it online shopping can sometimes be a hit and miss. You could order an item and get the wrong one shipped. Or it could just be that the product does not satisfy your needs as expected. In this situation you may want to return it or ask for a refund. BNPL apps ensure that you don’t have to worry about getting your funds back. Convenience – Speed matters these days and having a seamless payment experience makes shopping all the more enjoyable for consumers. There are two options to using BNPL apps: shopping directly in the apps or shopping on the merchant app or web interface. Either way you get the option to checkout with your preexisting account created on one of the BNPL apps. This can save you the need to look up your credit card numbers every time you shop online. Cost – credit cards are costly. Choosing an interest-free payment plan with pay later services and making your payments on time is a nifty way to save costs. You could think of this as a free loan.

Benefits of BNPL Apps to Merchants

As a merchant there is a lot to like about the Buy Now Pay Later apps and services. Here are some of the common reasons to adopt one of the deferred payment providers as an added payment option for your customers.

Increased sales – if you allow your customers to pay in installments they are more likely to buy higher ticket items or buy more items from you. Coupled with the fact that these deferred payments are interest-free it makes the decision a no-brainer for your consumers. Additionally by offering more payment options you help reduce cart abandonment issues. Research from Baymard Institute shows that retailers are losing as much as 6% of their potential sales due to a lack of enough payment options. Access to new customers – Buy Now Pay Later apps integrate their merchant interfaces into their shopping marketplaces allowing the shoppers to have a more comprehensive selection of goods from various retailers. This means a higher chance of getting new customers as a retailer that may not have otherwise chosen to shop in your store. Build trust and loyalty – the BNPL apps increases customer loyalty and confidence by allowing them to order items and make the payment once they have received them. They also don’t have to deal with the hustle of processing refunds if the goods are unsatisfactory. Keep up with the competition – the BNPL apps are increasingly becoming more popular. The chances are that your competition has embraced or is seriously considering it as a new payment option for their customers.

Risks of Adopting Buy Now Pay Later Apps

We can also split the risks into two categories: those to consumers and those to retailers.

Risks to consumers

Encourages consumer debt – not to forget the BNPL service is a loan product. Some consumers will likely misuse it and find themselves with more debt than they can handle.

– not to forget the BNPL service is a loan product. Some consumers will likely misuse it and find themselves with more debt than they can handle. Impact on credit score – depending on the BNPL app the consumer’s credit score could be impacted due to late payments and loan defaults.

– depending on the BNPL app the consumer’s credit score could be impacted due to late payments and loan defaults. More expensive – we previously mentioned that using BNPL apps is a cheaper option compared to using credit cards. Well this is true to an extent. Most apps offer interest-free payments for deferred payments of up 30 days or four installments every two weeks. Other apps offer consumers the option to purchase expensive items and pay over more extended periods say up to 48 months. However for these payment plans interest rates of up to 30% are usually charged. This is much more expensive than using a credit card.

Risks to retailers

For retailers there is more of an upside than a downside to integrating the later pay services. The only issue that can be considered a downside is:

Higher fees – consider this the credit card companies such as Visa and MasterCard charge a processing fee of between 1.43% and 3.5% for every transaction. In comparison BNPL services charge a transaction processing fee and a purchase value fee at the rate of 2-6%. In total this could add up to as high as 8% for a transaction depending on the BNPL provider. This is expensive.

This is how the Buy Now Pay Later apps make money in addition to late fees and interest fees charged on long-term loans to consumers.

Important After all they are still loan products and you should treat them as such to avoid financial pitfalls. When used diligently some of these apps can help users build their credit scores and access higher ticker items cheaply.

10 Best Buy Now Pay Later Apps for 2024

The market for deferred payment apps is growing at exponential rates spurred in part by the COVID-19 pandemic. As more and more people have lost their livelihoods these buy now pay later apps have become essential financial planning tools.

According to the Yahoo Finance report these apps are expected to “grow 10-15x by 2025 to eventually process $650bn-$1tn in transactions.” This is based on survey data shared by the Bank of America.

Naturally some of the leading financial players such as PayPal are not sitting around and watching other lesser-known brands overtake them. To take advantage of this growing popularity of the interest-free deferred payment solutions PayPal has launched the ‘Pay in 4’ product.

Here’s the ten best Buy Now Pay Later apps that you should be considering while planning for your shopping activities in 2024.

1. Klarna

Klarna offers its customers up to three payment plans: 4 interest-free installment payments every two weeks for six weeks a one-off payment in 30 days (also interest-free) and a protracted long-term credit solution with payments lasting between 6 and 36 months. The last option will attract an interest rate of up to 29.99% on orders above $540.

How Klarna makes money

Klarna makes the bulk of its money by charging retailers to use the service. The fees include $0.30 set on every transaction processed and a variable purchase-value fee of up to 5.99%. It also charges a $30 monthly fee to merchants using its Instant Shopping solution.

In addition to fees charged to retailers Klarna also charges customers late fees and interest on the long-term financing option. The interest-free payment plans attract a $7 late repayment fee while the latter attracts a $35 fine for every month that goes unpaid.

Does Klarna affect my credit score?

This depends on your repayment plan. For the two interest-free plans Klarna performs a soft check on your credit rating which doesn’t impact your credit score. However for the long-term financing option Klarna does contact credit bureaus and this will show up as an inquiry on your credit report.

2. Affirm

Affirm’s hompeage screenshot.

Headquartered in San Francisco Affirm was created in 2012 by PayPal co-founder Max Levchin. The company publicly listed its shares on NASDAQ in January 2021 under the ticker AFRM (Affirm Holdings Inc).

How it works

With Affirm you get only one financing option unlike Klarna. However just like Klarna’s financing option you will pay interest for credit solutions offered with Affirm.

Boasting over 6.5 million shoppers Affirm allows them to choose their repayment plans within periods 3 6 or 12 months. For large loans repayment periods can be extended up to 48 months while small loans can have equally short repayment periods of between 1 and 3 months without the option of extension. Interest rates vary according to credit records up to 30%. Credit limits vary from $50 to $17500.

Does Affirm affect my credit score?

Yes! Late repayments or defaulting on your payments does negatively affect your credit score. Affirm uses your credit score among other factors such as repayment history to determine your interest. Additionally the company has differing credit arrangements with merchants allowing some to charge as little as 0% APR rates for deferred payments.

Due to the various partnership agreements some customers might qualify for loans with some merchants and not others.

3. Quadpay

Quadpay’s homepage screenshot.

Quadpay has been around since 2017 and in that time has grown to become a significant player in the deferred payments niche. As the name suggests Quadpay allows its users to split their payments into four equal installments with the first installment made during checkout. The remaining three have to be paid within six weeks two weeks apart.

How it works

To qualify to use Quadpay one must fulfill four requirements: be a US citizen of majority age with a verifiable mobile number. Additionally they will need to use their payment cards to make payments.

Anyone can signup for the service during checkout through their retail partners or on their website.

How does Quadpay make money?

There are two ways Quadpay earns revenue: by charging retail partners and late fees. When making payments users will typically not be charged anything above the item’s price. For example if the product costs $100 the payments will be split into $25 paid in four installments—no interest fees.

However if the customer delays remitting payments they will be liable to a late fee ranging between $5 and $10 depending on their residence state. This penalty can be waived if payment is made within ten days from the due date.

Does Quadpay affect my credit score?

Not at all. Quadpay does perform soft credit checks on all applications. However this does not leave a credit check print. This means that late payments and defaults never affect customers. On the flip side you can’t use Quadpay shopping to build your credit history either.

4. PayPal’s ‘Pay in 4’

PayPal’s ‘Pay in 4’ page screenshot.

PayPal is a rather ubiquitous and popular payment option globally and its foray into the short-term installment payment solutions niche is a big deal. Launched in August 2020 the ‘Pay in 4’ is PayPal’s answer to Klarna.

The definition of the product is in the title. PayPal allows its US customers to pay for products costing between $30 and $600 in four equal installments with the first one made at the time of checkout. The other three are scheduled for payment two weeks apart for a total of six weeks.

How it works

PayPal is available as a payment option in millions of online stores and this means that you can use the Pay later option at any retailer that supports PayPal.

Once you have chosen your items and are ready to checkout choose the PayPal payment option redirecting you to the checkout page. Here you can select the Pay Later option then proceed to make your first installment. PayPal will notify you about subsequent payments before they fall due.

The product is interest-free but PayPal charges a late repayment fee on each installment.

Does PayPal’s ‘Pay in 4’ affect my credit score?

No it does not. PayPal uses your account usage history and performing soft credit checks using external bureau data to assess each application. This is done seamlessly to ensure minimal delay when checking out.

5. Sezzle

Sezzle’s homepage screenshot.

Sezzle is based in Minneapolis US serving more than 2 million customers in the US and Canada. Founded in 2016 Sezzle has also grown to become a staple solution for people seeking deferred payment loans.

Over 25000 participating merchants on the Sezzle platform give shoppers variety to choose their favorite retailer.

How it works

Similar to PayPal’s ‘Pay in 4’ solution Sezzle offers a four-installment payment plan. The first installment is due upon checkout with the other three even spread out two weeks apart.

The payment is interest-free so no extra charges on the cost of items. However the app charges a $10 late repayment fine and a $5 rescheduling fee.

Not many apps on this list offer users the option to reschedule their payments. Therefore if you need a more flexible loan app Sezzle might be a great option.

Does Sezzle affect my credit score?

Sezzle does not perform hard credit report checks which means that your activity on the app does not affect your credit score.

6. Afterpay

Afterpay’s homepage screenshot.

Afterpay was founded in Australia in 2015 by Nick Molnar and Anthony Eisen. In the last six years the FinTech company has attracted more than 11 million users based in North America the UK Australia and New Zealand. In the UK Afterpay offers its services through its subsidiary Clearpay Finance.

How it works

Payments on Afterpay are processed in six weeks with the first installment due upon checkout. Similar to other services on this list Afterpay also offers interest-free ‘pay-later’ loans.

The company makes its money from charging merchants as well as late repayment fees. In the United States the late fines are capped at 25% of the order value. This means that a shopper will not be charged more than 25% of the order value in penalties.

Users have several options for using Afterpay. There’s an app that integrates all the supported retailers and allows users to browse their favorite merchants all in one place. They can also use the retailer’s website or app and checkout using Afterpay. The last option is to use the Afterpay Card both online or in-store.

Does Afterpay affect my Credit Score?

No it does not. Activity on the platform is not subject to credit reference reporting and therefore any late payments only accrue fines not negative credit scores.

According to the service new users start with lower spending limits. Users can then increase their limits by using the app frequently and paying their loans on time.

7. Perpay

Perpay’s homepage screenshot.

Perpay was launched in 2014 and contrary to how most of the apps on this list work Perpay is more of a modern-day solution to payday loans. You could consider it old-fashioned but it does offer a similar service to the rest of the apps on this list.

The service uses your pay stub to assess your loan limit. However it is good to know that your credit score rarely affects your loan limit as long as you are employed with a stable paycheck.

How it works

Perpay allows new users to submit their information through a form. However if the provided information is not enough to accurately assess a user’s spending limit a pay stub may be requested instead.

Once the spending limit has been ascertained – between $500 and $2500 – a user can start shopping on the partner retail stores on the Perpay Marketplace.

Items added to the cart are submitted for approval. Once approved instructions on payment are sent via email. Usually this will entail instructions on how to make payment using a direct payroll deposit.

Shipping is only done after the first installment has been made typically on your next payday. Payments on Perpay are made in 8 monthly installments instead of the more popular four bi-weekly installments.

Late payments are charged a $35 fine.

Does Perpay affect my credit score?

Perpay does not use your credit score to determine spending limits and neither does it submit your payment history to the credit bureaus. Instead it uses updated information from your recent pay stubs.

8. Zebit

Zebit’s homepage screenshot.

Zebit works similarly to Perpay and offers customers a Zebitline credit line based on their salary prospects up to a limit of $2500. According to a launch press release published in 2015 the company was created to provide zero-interest credit to 68 million Americans with little to no access to traditional credit.

Zebit has pre-arranged agreements with employers to avail payroll information of their employees to assess each employee’s creditworthiness.

Using this information Zebit can work around the need to pull up FICO credit scores.

How it works

Consider Zebit a membership marketplace. The company sources wholesale items from sellers and sells them at retail price to Zebit account holders with available Zebitline credit.

There are various item categories to choose from including electronics furniture appliances fashion beauty products etc.

To access the marketplace open an account with Zebit and submit your information through a form. In the form you will provide your employment details including a social security number. Zebit uses this information to pull up soft credit records for verification purposes.

After choosing an item of purchase you can then checkout and make a down payment equal to 25% of the item’s value. You can do this using a credit card. If the down payment is not made the shipping is held until the full down payment is made.

Subsequent payments will be processed over the next six months through biweekly or monthly installments. The installments are interest-free i.e. 0% APR.

Does Zebit affect my Credit Score?

No it does not. It does however pull soft credit checks that don’t affect your credit record. If payment defaults Zebit the services of collections agencies and rescind the account’s available credit limit.

9. ViaBill

ViaBill’s hompeage screenshot.

ViaBill is a conventional pay later services provider. Users can buy their items place a 25% down payment and then make three equal monthly installments after that.

How it works

Like most Buy Now Pay Later apps ViaBill also offers interest-free repayments meaning that the product’s price at checkout will be the only amount you have to pay.

However it is worth noting that if monthly payments are missed the company charges late fees of up to $15.

This is one of the ways ViaBill makes money. Additionally it charges retailers a $30¢ fee per transaction on top of a 2.90% purchase value fee.

To use the service head on over to their supported stores’ websites shop and checkout using ViaBill. The company will deduct the down payment from your linked debit card or bank account. Application approvals are done instantaneously during checkout.

Does ViaBill affect my Credit Score?

No it does not. ViaBill pulls soft credit checks for verification purposes and this does not affect your credit score.

10. Splitit

Splitit’s homepage screenshot.

Splitit makes shopping seamless and effortless. No applications no fees nothing. With Splitit you get to use your credit or debit cards to shop and make regular payments interest free. It’s that simple.

How it works

The payment plan allows shoppers to make their first deposit during checkout and the remaining balances are split equally and paid monthly.

Debit card purchases are limited to $400 spend limits. Therefore buying items above that limit will require using a credit card. Additionally some merchants may decline the use of debit cards.

Since there are no fees charged to customers Splitit makes 100% of its money by charging the merchants. The merchants can opt to receive their money all at once during the customer checkout or receive it periodically as the customer makes installments. The latter option will cost a variable fee starting from 1.5% of the order value + $1.50 per installment. The former will be charged a one-off fee of 3% of the transaction value.

Does Splitit affect my Credit Score?

No it does not. Splitit has a simple application process that avoids credit checks because the money used is the customer’s money.

The activations in this campaign successfully shifted perceptions of beauty and launched conversations about unreasonable portrayals of women and beauty in the media.

The Biden administration's mission: to find a way to produce even more vaccine doses at a faster pace exceeding the quantity and timescale promised by pharmaceutical companies Pfizer and Moderna as part of their contracts with the U.S. government.

But experts say it will not be so easy. A vaccine is not a steel part it is a complex biomedical product.

""We're actually dealing with living organisms here"" said Cody Powers a principal at ZS Associates a professional services firm that works with companies to help develop and deliver medical products. It's ""different from making simple consumer goods that maybe you can put together a manufacturing line faster.""

Both Pfizer and Moderna use new vaccine technology: messenger RNA or mRNA. RNA is particularly fragile making it essential for the drugmakers to handle the process scrupulously and meticulously to maintain their quality control and ensure safety.

""To actually produce what's in the vaccine whether it's a reagent whether it's an antigen or in the case of the Pfizer and Moderna the mRNA you have to produce that part of it and then you have to harvest it and then you have to produce the encapsulation"" said Dr. Bruce Y. Lee Executive Director of Public Health Informatics Computational and Operations Research and professor of health policy and management at the City University of New York.

Each of these steps requires specific equipment as well as the right personnel to do it he said adding ""You can't necessarily always take one person from doing one aspect of a product line switching them over.""

There are also elaborate procedures to be followed to ensure that all the manufacturing requirements and safety protocols have been met and factories are subject to regular audits from the Food and Drug Administration. And the consequence of sending a spoiled batch out to be injected into people's arms would be catastrophic experts cautioned.

""Much time energy attention and resources are required to make sure that the process meets all the requirements to be able to produce in a responsible fashion"" noted Powers saying public trust in vaccines is fragile.

Meanwhile there's also a learning curve experts said. It's the first time this type of vaccine has been manufactured on such a massive commercial scale. Thus ""we don't know everything there is to know yet"" about these new vaccines and technologies added Powers.

Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said in an interview with Bloomberg on Tuesday that the company would be able to supply the U.S. with 200 million COVID-19 vaccine doses by the end of May two months sooner than previously expected.

Moderna's Chief Executive Officer Stéphane Bancel also said last month during a Nasdaq Investor Conference that he felt ""very comfortable"" that the company would be able to produce 500 million doses of its COVID-19 vaccine in 2021.

Johnson & Johnson which is expected to apply for an emergency use authorization in the coming weeks said Tuesday that it is on track to deliver 100 million coronavirus vaccine doses to the U.S. by the end of June.

But even if factories owned by Pfizer and Moderna -- the only two vaccines currently authorized in the U.S. -- are running at maximum capacity there might be other ways to boost supply experts said. A third company could volunteer offering up a factory with the right equipment to handle the task.

One example of such collaboration is that of French drugmaker Sanofi's deal with its rivals Pfizer and BioNTech to produce over 100 million doses of their mRNA vaccine for the European Union at Sanofi's site in Frankfurt Germany.

This uncommon pact could encourage other pharmaceutical firms to cooperate with companies developing effective vaccines Lee said.

But factories with this level of technical capacity are in short supply and they would need to stop manufacturing other lifesaving medicines to prioritize mRNA vaccines.

Vaccine makers rarely dedicate everything to one product Lee explained. ""They are also producing products that generate revenues for them"" Lee said.

President Joe Biden tours the COVID-19 vaccine center at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center Jan. 29 2021 in Bethesda Md. Alex Brandon/AP

Still experts said there might be other smaller ways the Biden administration can help boost manufacturing supply. The administration should evaluate the entire vaccine supply chain as quickly as possible to see where the vaccines are actually getting hung up Lee said.

""You don't just run out to the football field without planning and really seeing what's the situation first. If you're trying to adjust on the fly you may not know the deeper issue"" he said.

Within its first week the administration quickly zeroed-in on one key issue: syringes. The FDA has authorized medical workers to extract extra doses from Pfizer vials but to utilize all the available supply from those vials more precise specialized syringes are needed.

More people can be vaccinated if we make better use of the supply that is already being manufactured Powers said.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki discussed at her first briefing using the Defense Production Act a Cold War-era law that gives the government certain control over private industry to manufacture these syringes but the Biden administration has not been specific on any companies that might be actually doing this.

Meanwhile the administration could help companies secure much-needed raw materials and chemical ingredients -- an ongoing challenge particularly given that the pandemic is a global crisis with many nations competing for the same supplies.

""It's a global economy and we don't have the capability to provide everything we need on our shores"" said Erin Fox senior director of Drug Information and Support Services at University of Utah Health. Securing more raw ingredients could become a key diplomatic goal for the Biden administration.

But ultimately only the companies themselves can say exactly what would be helpful to boost supply. And the pharmaceutical industry is famously guarded said Fox.

""We actually don't know if we just have to trust the companies to tell us what they might need because they have no obligation to be transparent"" Fox said.

“While pregnancy puts women at higher risk of severe COVID-19 very little data are available to assess vaccine safety in pregnancy” the agency said.

“Nevertheless based on what we know about this kind of vaccine we don’t have any specific reason to believe there will be specific risks that would outweigh the benefits of vaccination for pregnant women” the international body said.

“For this reason those pregnant women at high risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 (e.g. health workers) or who have comorbidities which add to their risk of severe disease may be vaccinated in consultation with their health care provider” the statement read.

Experts from the agency had previously said the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccinations were not recommended for pregnant women unless they were at risk of high exposure.

Israel’s Health Ministry has advised pregnant women to get the coronavirus vaccine after a number of women expecting a baby fell seriously ill with several babies delivered prematurely via Caesarean section due to life-threatening risks to the mothers and the children.

The ministry said this week that women in their second or third trimesters should be inoculated but that women in their first trimester should wait unless there were other risk factors.

The ministry said that the recommendation not to vaccinate in the early weeks of pregnancy was not due to any concerns over increased risk but rather worries that any bleeding or miscarriage of which there is a higher risk in the first trimester could be mistakenly linked to the vaccine.

The United States’ Centers for Disease Control also said this week that pregnant women should be permitted to receive the vaccine noting that they are at increased risk of severe disease or death from COVID-19.

“People who are pregnant and part of a group recommended to receive the COVID-19 vaccine may choose to be vaccinated” the agency said in a statement.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiKmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vbmV3cy9uZXdzYmVhdC01NTgxMTYzMdIBLmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vbmV3cy9uZXdzYmVhdC01NTgxMTYzMS5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'I worked on the vaccine my dad was given',,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilQFodHRwczovL2VuZ2xpc2guYWxhcmFiaXlhLm5ldC9jb3JvbmF2aXJ1cy8yMDIxLzAxLzMwL0Nvcm9uYXZpcnVzLUxlYmFub24tZXhwZWN0cy10by1yZWNlaXZlLVBmaXplci1Bc3RyYVplbmVjYS1DT1ZJRC0xOS12YWNjaW5lLXNoaXBtZW50cy1pbi1GZWJydWFyedIBmQFodHRwczovL2VuZ2xpc2guYWxhcmFiaXlhLm5ldC9hbXAvY29yb25hdmlydXMvMjAyMS8wMS8zMC9Db3JvbmF2aXJ1cy1MZWJhbm9uLWV4cGVjdHMtdG8tcmVjZWl2ZS1QZml6ZXItQXN0cmFaZW5lY2EtQ09WSUQtMTktdmFjY2luZS1zaGlwbWVudHMtaW4tRmVicnVhcnk?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lebanon expects to receive Pfizer AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine shipments in February,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://english.alarabiya.net/coronavirus/2021/01/30/Coronavirus-Lebanon-expects-to-receive-Pfizer-AstraZeneca-COVID-19-vaccine-shipments-in-February on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilQFodHRwczovL2VuZ2xpc2guYWxhcmFiaXlhLm5ldC9jb3JvbmF2aXJ1cy8yMDIxLzAxLzMwL0Nvcm9uYXZpcnVzLUxlYmFub24tZXhwZWN0cy10by1yZWNlaXZlLVBmaXplci1Bc3RyYVplbmVjYS1DT1ZJRC0xOS12YWNjaW5lLXNoaXBtZW50cy1pbi1GZWJydWFyedIBmQFodHRwczovL2VuZ2xpc2guYWxhcmFiaXlhLm5ldC9hbXAvY29yb25hdmlydXMvMjAyMS8wMS8zMC9Db3JvbmF2aXJ1cy1MZWJhbm9uLWV4cGVjdHMtdG8tcmVjZWl2ZS1QZml6ZXItQXN0cmFaZW5lY2EtQ09WSUQtMTktdmFjY2luZS1zaGlwbWVudHMtaW4tRmVicnVhcnk?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdXN0b25jaHJvbmljbGUuY29tL25ld3MvaG91c3Rvbi10ZXhhcy9oZWFsdGgvYXJ0aWNsZS9Nb250aHMtYWZ0ZXItQ09WSUQtbGVmdC1oaW0taW4tdGhlLWZldGFsLTE1OTA4MjE4LnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Months after COVID left him in the 'fetal position' Houston pilot delivers first Pfizer vaccine,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/health/article/Months-after-COVID-left-him-in-the-fetal-15908218.php on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdXN0b25jaHJvbmljbGUuY29tL25ld3MvaG91c3Rvbi10ZXhhcy9oZWFsdGgvYXJ0aWNsZS9Nb250aHMtYWZ0ZXItQ09WSUQtbGVmdC1oaW0taW4tdGhlLWZldGFsLTE1OTA4MjE4LnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

McConnell continues surprising for Pacers,"Former Arizona Wildcats point guard T.J. McConnell is approaching a decade in the NBA an unlikely journey that has even seen McConnell become a playoff X-Factor for his Indiana Pacers. He was a huge part of Indiana nearly pulling off the upset in the first round versus the New York Knicks in a 121-117 Game 1 loss.

McConnell had 18 points three assists and three steals on 9-of-16 shooting in 22 minutes.

McConnell went undrafted in 2015 not thought of as much of a NBA prospect. He was not a shooter at the time and hasn’t developed into one since. He’s generously listed at 6-foot-1 lacks explosive movement and didn’t score too much as a Wildcat either.

What McConnell can do however is read the floor at an expert level and use his quickness from there to shift it mostly to set up his teammates. This got him a shot at making the Philadelphia 76ers roster which he did and he has been a near-constant as a rotation player since.

This season McConnell’s ninth in the league has really seen him break out as a bucket-getter. Yes you read that correctly. From Feb. 6 on McConnell off the bench averaged 13.3 points per game while shooting 58.2% from the field. Again that’s while taking less than one 3-pointer a game and for the season he knocked down 56.8% of his 2s.

McConnell’s quite honestly weird midrange game at Arizona consisting of 12-foot fallaways and other odd touch shots at the rim is now something he’s able to activate more frequently with confidence and a high level of understanding for where the real estate will be. On a spaced-out roster built around floor general Tyrese Haliburton McConnell has the room to scoot around and take his goofy shots.

He’s even got a little bit of shake to his handle despite dribbling like someone from a half-century ago.

T.J. McConnell slices through the defense and gets to the hoop for two 💨 pic.twitter.com/DzNx7AAHj5 — Indiana Pacers (@Pacers) May 7 2024

Defenses just aren’t used to defending someone like him. Looking at guards around his size McConnell was the first to put up at least 10 points a game with under one 3PA/G since Derrick Rose in 2016-17 and Tony Parker in 2015-16 per Stathead. New York was understandably trying to get away with either Jalen Brunson or Miles McBride defending McConnell without using its best perimeter options on him before changing that late.

One of McConnell’s signature attributes is his pace of play which will help the Pacers tremendously against the Knicks. McConnell always wants to get the ball up quickly and is rarely going to waste dribbles looking to at least threaten for the paint whenever possible like one of his all-time favorites Steve Nash. Defensively he will pick guys up fullcourt to do some pest work and moves like a guy who never runs out of energy.

The Knicks play a short rotation and commonly put starters in the low-to-mid 40s for minutes and Indiana was deliberately speeding the game up on both ends to play the long game of wearing New York down. McConnell will be a key part of that effort with his importance in a second-round series still being hard to believe.

This is a big recruiting win for the Runnin' Utes as they add a very promising young talent to the mix.

Little announced his commitment via Twitter:

As a 6-foot-4 185 pound guard Little shows the ability to do a bit of everything. He can be the primary ball handler he has a strong handle to go along with good feel for scoring opportunities for himself or others. He can score inside and out and can play off the ball as well. There are a lot of natural playmaking qualities that Little possesses and he's showcased good defensive ones as well. Despite the fact that he saw inconsistent playing time this past season he is still regarded as a four-star transfer prospect.

Utah brought Little in for an official visit this past weekend and were able to make a very good impression. Little is a native of Finland which gives the program valuable relationships in the form of Hanno Mottola Mikael Jantunen and even Lauri Markennan all of whom are connected through the Finland national team.

Little entered the portal after his first and only season with Baylor. The Bears had quite the logjam in the backcourt which led to him looking for a better opportunity elsewhere. Little still showcased his productive potential in games where he got extended playing time.

He is a former top 50 overall prospect and top 10 point guard in the 2023 recruiting class. He committed to Baylor over Indiana and Villanova while also having significant interest from other power programs in college basketball as well. Little earned a 94 four-star rating and No. 9 ranking in 247Sports' 2023 recruiting class.

Little did not play his ""senior year"" of high school at Sunrise Christian Academy but played for the Helsinki Basketball Academy (HBA) in Finland. HBA is a part of the Finland 1st Division basketball league and is essentially a high school program competing against professional players in Finland. Little averaged 21.6 points 9.0 rebounds and 5.8 assists in 20 games in this league during the 2021-22 season.

He joins Utah with three seasons of eligibility and a redshirt remaining. He is the fourth transfer addition and joins Keanu Dawes Mason Madsen and Zach Keller in Utah's transfer portal class. Utah now has five open spots remaining on the roster.

Blocker played in 27 games starting five for Arkansas as a true freshman. He averaged just under four points per game.

As a member of the Class of 2023 Blocker was a four-star recruit out of Little Rock (Ark.) Sunrise Christian (Kans.) according to the On3 Industry Ranking a weighted average that utilizes all four major recruiting media companies. He was the No. 2 overall prospect coming out of Kansas the No. 12 point guard in the class and the No. 45 overall prospect in the class.

Blocker shared on social media when he intended enter the transfer portal.

“Prayer hard work and sacrifice opened up the doors for me to have an opportunity to play college basketball” Blocker said. “First and foremost I want to thank God for blessing me with the talent to play this game. I want to thank the University of Arkansas basketball coaching staff for recruiting me. It was an honor to represent the state of Arkansas and the Razorback program. I’m grateful for my teammates that have become brothers that who’ve all supported me on this journey.

“Thank you to all of the fans and the community for your love and support throughout the season. I also want to give a special thanks to the local businesses for your support. After much discussion and consideration I’ve decided to enter the transfer portal.”

Blocker’s former coach Eric Musselman who left to take the USC gig raved about his former player’s development back in February.

“I thought he played really good tonight” Musselman said. “Obviously his two steals in the 23 minutes that he was in he was able to guard (Wade) Taylor and did a really good job other than the fouls. But we want him to be aggressive defensively. I thought he was phenomenal tonight.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnByaW5jZWdlb3JnZWNpdGl6ZW4uY29tL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvcHJpbmNlLWdlb3JnZS1jb3VnYXJzLXJlbWFya2FibGUtc2Vhc29uLWVuZHMtaW4tZG91YmxlLW92ZXJ0aW1lLTg3MDc0MTHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Josh Davies scores series-winner in OT Portand beats PG 2-1,"Josh Davies scores series winner Portland Winterhawks advance to WHL final

It’s all over for the Prince George Cougars.

Josh Davies ended the Cats’ terrific season 5:40 into double overtime with a gut-wrenching shot from 30 feet out sending the Portland Winterhawks to the WHL championship series with a 2-1 victory in Game 6 of the Western Conference championship Monday at CN Centre.

The longest game in Prince George’s 30-year WHL history ended in sudden death and it came seconds after Borya Valis’s close-range shot at immortality at the other end of the rink was blocked by Portland defenceman Tyson Jugnauth. The puck skipped to Josh Mori who fed it up to Davies and he wired a low wrist shot into the far corner behind Joshua Ravensbergen.

“They got a couple good chances in our end and we got a good block Josh Mori made a nice play and I joined the rush and after that I kind of blacked out” said Davies. “I saw the puck go in the net and the rest is history.

“Our team was ready for big moments like this this is what we grinded out all year for. Now that the moment has come we couldn’t be happier. We’re in the dance now and we’re ready to go.”

The Winterhawks will now await the winner of the Saskatoon Blades-Moose Jaw Warriors series to determine who they will be playing in the next round.

Davies a Florida Panthers draft pick in 2022 missed four games of the series with an injury and his return to the lineup after being sidelined in Game 1 came just in time for the ‘Hawks.

Both teams had glorious chances to end it in the first overtime period.

Portland failed to convert a 3-on-1 chance just before the three-minute mark when Ravensbergen stuffed the shot from Diego Buttazzoni. Thirteen minutes into overtime ‘Hawks captain Gabe Klassen got the puck in deep and tried to tuck it between the goalie’s legs but Ravensbergen somehow came up with the stop.

The Winterhawks took a penalty 8:20 into overtime and came out of it unscathed holding the P.G. power play without a shot. The Cougars buzzed the net numerous times with great looks but came up empty trying to put one past Spunar.

The opening goal of the game came with a minute left in the second period but nobody knew that for certain until after the clock had run out. The goal from Winterhawks exquisite playmaker Nate Danielson came as a result of a close-in shot that crossed the line and was instantly cleared by Cougars defenceman Hudson Thornton as the Portland players briefly celebrated. The play continued and the period ended with Thornton bouncing a high shot that nearly found the back of the Portland net behind Jan Spunar.

The Cougar coaching staff was already heading into the locker room when video goal judge Lance Van Helvoirt confirmed Danielson’s shot had indeed crossed the goal line. He got on the phone with referee Bobby Jo Love to tell him it was a good goal giving the Hawks a 1-0 lead to take into the second intermission.

It didn’t take long for the Cougars to tie it up.

Zac Funk gained the puck behind the goal line and pushed it over to Riley Heidt who wasted no time dumping it out into the slot for Valis who blasted it in for his ninth of the playoffs much to the delight of Cougar fans in a sellout crowd of 6016 who leapt to their feet with an ear-splitting roar.

Both teams had their chances gunning for the go-ahead goal. Mori joined the rush and Ravensbergen kicked out a dangerous-looking shot just before the Cougars went on the power play midway through the third period. The puck was in the Portland zone for most of that two-minute session but they couldn’t beat Spunar.

With less than two minutes left in regulation time Chase Pauls made a nice play with his glove at the blueline to knock down a Portland clearing attempt and his shot deflected off Ondrej Becher in the slot and just missed the net high.

Winterhawks head coach and general manager Mike Johnston noted that while the series produced a few lopsided scores he thought all six games reflected how close the two teams were. The Cougars finished just one point ahead of Portland atop the Western Conference standings and both teams raised their game in the series to an amazing level that produced highly-entertaining hockey that impressed everyone in the building.

“I know there was some games where there was a spread on the score and it looked like one team was maybe winning it easier but I don’t think through the whole series there was more than a one-goal difference between the teams” said Johnston. “Both teams played outstanding in the series. Both teams have a core of really good players and both play a style that up-tempo and fast as you saw tonight.

“I’ve been on the other side with a good team like P.G. had and you’re home trying to squeeze it out and you miss it. We were fortunate You got to get a bounce and we got a bounce. It was a big character win for us because we were down a few players. Playing a series without (Luca) Cagnoni our top-minute defenceman was a big loss for us but they lost (Terik) Parascak a really key player for them.”

The Winterhawks were eliminated in the second round in the previous two playoff years and Johnston said the core of his team learned from that and used it to overcome their adversity this season.

“Now we pushed through the third round it’s hard in playoffs” he said. “Getting that experience with P.G. having a lot of returning players they’ve got to be one of the favourites heading into next year.”

If that is the case Cougar overagers Funk Thornton and Pauls won’t be there to see it having now played their last junior hockey game.

“I’m almost speechless it’s such a tough feeling honestly” said Thornton the Cougar captain after spending about half an hour after the game in the room with his teammates. We’ve been through so much this year as a group and we’ve come so far and this city deserves so much.

“We try to give our best every single night and at the end of this you wanted to give them a championship and obviously we didn’t do that so it’s pretty disappointing. Overall we had a tremendous season and the group that we have is so special we’re brothers for life.”

The Cougars established franchise records for wins and points and finished the season as the No. 1 ranked team in Canada. They truly believed they had what it took to go all the way.

“That’s what’s so disappointing and the guys really feel it we didn’t think we were going to lose” said Cougars head coach and general manager Mark Lamb. “It was a really good year when you get by the disappointment which I can’t get by right now yet. When I look back in a couple days and reflect on it it will be a lot better but it really hurts right now.

“Winning is so so hard and the guys really got a feeling of it tonight. They played so well bit they will learn. Portland is a winning organization and they have been for a few years now and we look at that and that’s where we’re at now. We’re turning into one of those organizations .”

Spunar picked up his 12th win in 14 playoff starts and looked unbeatable at times as did Cougar goalie Josh Ravensbergen and they put on a classic goaltending clinic with both teams testing them relentlessly. The Cougars outshot Portland 49-38.

Just as they did in their two wins in the series in Portland the Winterhawks got off to a great start and the 17-year-old rookie Ravensbergen was the reason they were not be down by a goal or two after the opening period.

Led by Danielson the WHL’s player of the week who came into Monday’s game with a goal and nine assists in the series the ‘Hawks forced the Cougar goalie to make three saves in the opening minute.

The Cougars finally got their offence untracked on a four-minute power play that came 4:17 in when Davies took exception to Nick McLennan’s crushing hit that knocked Ryan Miller off his feet and into the boards and was served a double roughing penalty.

The penalty came seconds after Davies was denied by spectacular glove stop from Ravensbergen off the rush on a feed into the slot from Miller. With Davies in the box came close a couple times but the 19-year-old Czechian goalie was locked in on the task at hand.

Portland came out guns-a-blazing in the second period and severely tested Ravensbergen at least three times in the first five minutes including a glove stop to deny Kyle Chyzowski on a 2-on-1 setup and keep the game scoreless.

Inspired by their goalie’s heroic efforts the Cougars were finally able to deliver sustained pressure for the first time since their extended power play in the first period. The Funk-Heidt-Valis line delivered a dominant shift and threw everything but the kitchen sink at Spunar and he had to come up with three huge saves.

The Eastern Conference final resumes with Game 7 Tuesday night in Saskatoon. Four of the six games in the series have required overtime.

LOOSE PUCKS: The Cougars’ previous longest game happened April 10 1997 in Game 1 of the Western final in Seattle. Peter Roed ended it for the Cougars 1:59 into the second overtime. The Thunderbirds went on to win that third-round series in six games … The Winterhawks will board an Air Canada charter for the flight back to Portland Tuesday morning … Cats forward Hunter Laing was named the WHL’s rookie of the week.

Yasid Oozeear the digital artist who came up with this proposal was in the giggle mood so the white-and-red color play actually (almost) displays the name of a fast-food giant that has also worked its way into popular culture. So now you know what led to us introducing the nickname in the title.This pixel portrait is an opportunity for us to zoom in on what's happening in the real world where tobacco companies are returning to F1 cars via the smoke-and-mirrors pathway (pun intended).While back in the 1970s and 1980s tobacco funding was one of the major driving forces in motorsport the names of cigarette brands were removed from the teams' colors in the mid-2000s as a result of stricter advertising regulations albeit with the ties between the two industries remaining in place for potential opportunities.And those opportunities eventually showed up in the final part of last decade with e-cigarettes fueling a comeback. We're talking about Ferrari signing a deal with Marlboro owner Philip Morris International and McLaren reaching an agreement with British American Tobacco while the display of the two companies' ""potentially reduced risk"" product branding on F1 cars continues to cause controversy.With that out of the way you should know the artist also showcases a different livery for the Poncho we have here which you'll find in the second Instagram post below.Regardless of the attire the 1965 Pontiac GTO has been gifted with an extreme aero approach that makes one think of the racing realm. From the extreme aero bits adorning the lower side of the vehicle to the widebody approach and the rollcage adorning the cabin this Poncho looks like it's ready to challenge the stopwatch. So dear purists you could perhaps find a bit of comfort in the wing's functional role.And thanks to the side pipes and the custom wheels (would you look at those generous lips at the back!) the profile of the vehicle is just as aggressive as the front end or the posterior.Now those of you who are tuned into our Speed Shot tales might be experiencing a bit of déjà vu and that's because Oozeear recently delivered an even more extreme take on the '65 GTO taking the model that popularized the muscle car breed down the six-wheeler route via a concept that reminds one of the Tyrell P34 Formula One car introduced back in 1976 which links the steering wheel to no less than four wheels.",,,,,,,,,

Smaller slower and more profitable. These are the watchwords for Chesapeake Energy as it emerges from bankruptcy. Free of the colossal liabilities that sank it as the pandemic slashed global energy demand last year the company has also abandoned the growth-at-all-costs strategy that made it a pioneer of the shale revolution — and poster child of the sector’s debt-fuelled excess.

Chesapeake’s market value will be a fraction of the $35bn it boasted more than a decade ago back when its controversial founder the late Aubrey McClendon was America’s best-paid chief executive and his company poured money into everything from Oklahoma real estate to an NBA arena. The new Chesapeake pledges to spend less than it brings in and return the excess to shareholders.

Outside the US oil and gas industry this wouldn’t sound radical. Within the business it is a departure. The only feature that matched shale’s disruptive rise in the past 15 years — more than doubling US oil and gas production and sharply reducing dependence on foreign oil supplies — was the industry’s unmatched knack for destroying investors’ money as hundreds of billions of dollars were spent with little return. Wall Street reacted by dumping its stocks making the sector one of the S&P 500’s smallest. When the worst oil crash in decades struck last year operators were forced to slash capital expenditure sack tens of thousands of workers idle rigs and cut production. Chesapeake’s Chapter 11 filing was just the most high-profile of scores of bankruptcies.

Now promise shale executives a more resilient industry is emerging from the ashes that aims to woo investors. Like the reincarnated Chesapeake it will be smaller — some analysts believe the sector will be reduced to just 10 dominant shale producers. Production increases will be modest and financed from cash flow. And activity will focus on fewer prolific shale fields mainly in Texas. Oil operators that feared new US president Joe Biden’s ambition to launch a green energy revolution would stymie the industry’s drilling and slow production growth now promise to do both themselves.

“I do believe we have a lot of proving to do to get investors back” says Vicki Hollub head of Occidental Petroleum which 18 months ago racked up $50bn in debt buying a rival producer in a deal now considered one of the most reckless gambles in the shale patch’s short history.

Cash flow and earnings growth must be the new priorities Ms Hollub says. “I believe that the watershed moment is here and our industry will I don’t think ever be the way we have been in the past.”

Can the industry’s new pitch be trusted? Some investors remain sceptical remembering how past promises of capital discipline crumbled when oil prices rose. “Give an oilman a dollar and he’ll drill a well” runs the old industry adage. In an era when environmental concerns are already deterring investment in fossil fuels and long-term growth in oil demand is no longer assured shale executives know they cannot risk breaking more promises.

“Why should investors trust it?” asks Matt Gallagher who headed Parsley Energy a shale producer acquired by larger operator Pioneer Natural Resources last year. “They shouldn’t.”

Early warning signs

After years of growth shale’s cash-intensive business model was running on fumes even before Saudi Arabia’s price war with Russia and the coronavirus pandemic crashed the oil market last year. The sector’s defining feature is the fast decline of each shale well’s production where output can drop by 80 per cent after just a year. To offset the loss another must be drilled. Then another to offset that well’s loss.

“In a shale play if you stop running you will fly off the back of the treadmill” says Raoul LeBlanc vice-president of energy at consultancy IHS Markit and former head of strategic planning at Anadarko Petroleum the company bought by Occidental in 2019. “Just to stay still you’ve got to do a lot of drilling.”

Operators drilled more than 14000 shale wells in 2019 according to Rystad an energy research company. It helped the US hit record-high oil output near 13m barrels a day a level unmatched even by Saudi Arabia and Russia the world’s next biggest producers.

That was a rise from 5m b/d just eight years earlier — a surge that sparked booms from Texas to North Dakota and helped drag the US economy out of the mire of the global financial crisis adding one percentage point to GDP between 2010 and 2015 according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. But it required huge infusions of cash offered at basement interest rates. Rystad says the sector spent around $400bn capital in those years but by 2019 free cash flow arrived only once in 2016.

“The fundamental problem with the shale model over the past decade has been the pursuit of growth over return on capital employed or returning capital to shareholders” says Ben Dell managing partner at Kimmeridge a private equity firm that has built up an activist position in the sector.

Investors that rushed to finance shale’s recovery from the 2014-15 price crash — an earlier Saudi price war to capture market share — were fleeing by 2019. As capital markets began to close for shale companies operators were forced to trim spending plans reducing new drilling activity. With profits still absent and growth prospects diminishing the shale patch entered 2020 in distress.

A reputation for flagrant corporate misgovernance and excess — from colossal executive bonuses earned by hitting oil output growth targets not profits to flashy office developments and rumours of company-funded hunting trips — didn’t help.

Then came last year’s price crash including the symbolic moment in April when West Texas Intermediate the country’s benchmark crude contract traded below zero for the first time. “Covid hits oil prices collapse everyone has to cut their capex valuations crash” says Aaron DeCoste an equity analyst at Boston Partners an institutional investor. “And it’s effectively reset the entire industry.”

Just a few shale companies showed they could survive the collapse last year in relative health says Mr Gallagher. From Chesapeake to scores of smaller producers the distress was acute with more than 100 operators and service providers with $102bn in debt going under according to a Rystad analysis from law firm Haynes and Boone.

“The ones that went wrong went way wrong” Mr Gallagher says. “What’s going on now is people are finding religion about the models that work.”

M&A rush

One tenet of the new shale “religion” is that scale is critical to survival — but of operators not the overall sector. The mergers and acquisitions to achieve adequate size coupled with the consolidation of weakened companies will continue to shrink the number of producers.

Lee Maginniss managing director at Alvarez & Marsal an advisory firm involved in oil industry restructuring says subscale producers will face “intense” pressure. From around 500 exploration and production companies in the US before the crash 50 may survive he says. Other analysts say just 10 or so dominant public shale companies will be left to run the best plays.

M&A activity is brisk with $52bn worth of deals done in the US oil sector last year according to Enverus a data provider. Chevron moved first buying Noble Energy in July. ConocoPhillips bought Concho Resources. Devon Energy merged with WPX Energy. Heavy debt battered balance sheets and weak equity valuations meant that stocks not cash were the currency in each deal.

Pierre Breber Chevron’s chief financial officer expects the consolidation wave to continue. “You need to have bigger players stronger players more disciplined management teams stronger balances sheets” he says. Scott Sheffield Pioneer’s chief executive says only companies with market capitalisation above $10bn will remain attractive to a value-focused investor base.

Scale will also allow them to compete with ExxonMobil and Chevron US majors which have built up commanding shale positions. Between them they intend to produce about 2m b/d from the Permian Basin later this decade — almost a fifth of total current US crude production.

Most of the M&A activity has occurred in that shale oilfield the world’s most prolific where operators will concentrate on the rich layers of oil-bearing rocks in the Delaware and Midland Basins of New Mexico and Texas. Gas-focused players such as the revamped Chesapeake are likely to stick to their best assets. Other shale fields even the Bakken of North Dakota that sparked the shale oil rush a decade ago will lose out.

“The heydays of the Bakken [Texas’s] Eagle Ford [Nebraska’s] Niobrara the Scoop Stack play in Oklahoma are all over” says Mr Sheffield referring to other shale fields in the US.

Capping output

But the main feature of the post-crash shale patch will be an era of tepid growth — if it expands at all. Rick Muncrief chief executive of Devon says his company can now break even at $30 a barrel or less well below the $50-plus for oil in recent weeks. Yet Devon will hold its rig count flat this year only drilling a few wells to meet the lease terms of some acreage.

“From publicly traded companies you’ll see a very measured response” says Mr Muncrief. US oil production is likely to fall by 200000-300000 b/d as a result he believes remaining around 11m b/d — well below the record highs set before last year’s crash.

“Are people going to return to growth? Is US shale going to grow? The answer is no” says Mr Sheffield. “Don’t anticipate a big ramp up in drilling people are not going to go back to the old ways.”

Even if oil prices hit $100 Mr Sheffield says his company would only increase output by 5 per cent a year — less than half the rate of average annual growth in total shale production between 2008 and the beginning of last year.

Analysts say this will be enforced by the market which has punished excessive supply growth — even before the pandemic hit last year — reducing oil and gas’s share of the S&P 500 almost to a footnote.

“The reason why energy is down to 2 per cent of the S&P 500 is because of that behaviour” says Mr Breber. Until the world has fully recovered it will not need shale producers to increase oil supply he says.

So far operators are holding the line. Rystad says third-quarter capital spending by the 39 main shale operators it covers was $3.6bn beneath cash flows from operations allowing a record 89 per cent of operators to balance their budgets. If the discipline sticks dividend- and value-focused investors could be lured back.

“I see attractive fundamentals that I haven’t seen for 20 years” says Mr DeCoste referring to the cheap valuations of some operators juxtaposed with expectations for higher oil prices. But he is cautious about the new capital discipline pledges: “It takes years to build your reputation and moments to destroy it.”

Prisoner’s dilemma

Despite the wave of consolidation other analysts and investors remain unconvinced by shale’s new mantra and more mature outlook saying operators will be unable to resist another supply surge if the recent price rally continues. “Gordon Gekko once said ‘greed is good’” says one adviser to shale operators. “In the oil patch that means ‘growth is good’.”

Chief executives are just “giving the audience what it wants to hear” says Art Berman a consultant and shale sceptic. Forgoing growth is “absolutely antithetical to the DNA of oil companies in general but shale companies in particular”.

Investors will be hesitant to take operators’ pledges on faith alone says Ms Hollub. “It’s going to be a ‘show me’ situation with them.”

Higher prices in recent weeks are already testing operators’ resolve. The weekly horizontal rig count hit 338 in mid-January more than 60 per cent above its low in August. Private operators which account for about 15 per cent of onshore US oil production have led the resurgence taking advantage of falling costs caused by the drop in demand for oilfield services from publicly listed companies.

“We can drill cheaper” says Wil VanLoh head of Quantum Energy Partners a large private equity shale investor referring to his portfolio companies. “By definition private capital is growth capital . . . we out-drill our cash flow until the time we get to positive free cash flow.”

It is the kind of message that public company bosses insisting they will not be drawn into another competitive drilling binge do not want to hear — especially as some analysts project more oil price increases. Goldman Sachs predicts Brent the international benchmark will rise to $65 a barrel by mid-year.

Rystad’s head of shale research Artem Abramov says he expects 2021 to “become the best year for the industry from the perspective of free cash flow generation”. It may even allow for profitability — and new production growth testing operators’ promises to investors.

At an average WTI price of just $52 a barrel this year — around the current price — the shale operators Rystad covers would rake in almost $41bn from operations. After capex commitments debt payments and more than $4bn returned to shareholders they would still have $8bn of net cash in hand. The question is what they do with it.

“I think they lose discipline and they probably bring on too much growth and damage the market again — like they did every year in the past” says Mr LeBlanc. “They’re in a prisoner’s dilemma. They never have discipline as a group because they’re all competing with each other.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50L2EyMGZjNWU0LWIwMmItNGUzOS1hNjhjLWJmNDhhMmM1NTk2ONIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Labour demands ban on North Sea gas flaring,"Try unlimited access Only MX$100 for 4 weeks

The report titled ‘The Regulator’s Dilemma: Financial Innovation Within a Regulatory Paradigm’ details how tech giants’ success in raising standards concerning online experiences has driven increased consumer demands for digital banking services in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA).



As online services witness an uptake amongst Saudi customers banking is fast becoming digital. As per the report’s findings the use of digital banking channels has increased significantly across the country during the pandemic with 43 percent of customers using online banking and 55 percent using their respective banks’ mobile app more often.



This year consumer expectations have shifted to include simpler interfaces and journeys digital-first experiences data-driven personalized offerings and frictionless on-demand access to information and services. Moreover the pandemic has further pushed these trends propelling financial institutions to move from a digital as a choice to a digital as the only choice approach.



“COVID-19 and subsequent events that took place have increased consumers’ already ravenous appetite for digital financial services. Like many other nations across the region and wider world this applies to the KSA as well” said Harold Haddad managing director and partner BCG Middle East. “Consumer demands have grown with Apple Google Facebook Netflix and other leading tech influencers simultaneously elevating the quality of digital interactions and online experiences — transcending industries to implicate banking too. As banks and financial technology (fintech) firms strive to accommodate customers with progressively sophisticated solutions regulators are poised to take on a more important role in the coming period.”



The report highlights that regulators are not alone and emphasizes the need to orchestrate across a set of actors. Regulators are one of six main actors in the national fintech ecosystem with the others being education and research institutions venture capital funds startup incubators and accelerators public institutions and incumbent banks.



Looking ahead how successfully regulators steer the ever-evolving sector will depend on how well they understand and support new aspects of fintech innovation cybersecurity and consumer privacy and security. In the Middle East operational fintech’s have grown from 30 in 2008 to more than 200 today and these firms together with traditional banks are working relentlessly to ride the current wave of digital momentum. Because they are developing and adopting the latest digital technologies at an unprecedented pace regulators need to proactively build their fintech agenda or else they’ll be struggling to keep up.



“The ultimate objective from a regulator standpoint is to maintain the financial sector’s stability while protecting consumers from inequitable deceptive or abusive activities” said Haytham Yassine principal BCG Middle East. “We have seen from numerous studies that economies that foster innovation in financial services open doors for digital advancement and economic growth. Regulators in KSA should build on the country’s fintech momentum and further drive their regulatory agenda to foster financial innovations amid the increased consumer appetite for digital banking channels.”



BCG has identified four areas where KSA regulators can take proactive measures to support innovation while preserving stability:



• Revamp regulatory frameworks to foster fintech’s: Regulators can continue building on their momentum in this space and move licensing from entity-focused to activity-centric focusing for example on issuing electronic money providing payment services and offering crypto-exchange among other activities. At the same time they can use a risk-based approach to mandate initial capital requirements for licensed fintechs.



• Set up innovation sandboxes to safely test new ideas products and services: In these conceptual controlled environments fintechs can try out new ideas within pre-defined parameters. In addition to encouraging innovation while maintaining control over regulation and supervision these will show where new or revised regulations may be required.



• Encourage banks to collaborate via open banking: Sharing and leveraging customer-permissioned data by banks with third-party developers and firms means they can build applications and services together. Wider access to financial data will also open up new opportunities.



• Build up cyber resilience: Regulators should set up dedicated cybersecurity functions proactively develop related strategies and bring together public and private entities to share strategic and technical cyber practices and learnings.



“Rather than working in isolation regulators in the KSA should proactively pull in and work with the broader fintech ecosystem to make the national fintech agenda as effective as possible and foster innovation” added Harold. “Consumer demands for digital will continue to increase and regulators can help lead the charge by innovating and transforming financial services.” — SG

In Loving Memory ~

It is with very heavy hearts that we announce the passing of Michael (Mike) Robert Procter 79 of 150 Mile House BC on February 6 2024.

In North Vancouver BC Mike was the first of three children born to Mary and Peter Procter. Mike grew up in Williams Lake BC after the family moved there in 1951.

After graduating school he followed in his father's footsteps by becoming an Electrician. Working for his father's company Procter Electric he worked throughout the Cariboo-Chilcotin and Mike and his father were instrumental in creating novel systems to generate electricity at remote ranches and locations throughout the region.

He moved on to working in the industrial sector and became highly skilled in his trade. High in demand he worked in the construction of new sawmills and in various plants all throughout BC. Later he worked at several local sawmills and contracted throughout the area.

Over all those years Mike made many friendships that endured for the rest of his life.

He went on to marry Cheryl Midnight and they had two children Chris and Jody.

Mike had a penchant for fast cars nice trucks and fine guns. He enjoyed hunting fishing and classic car restoration. He traveled to horse shows throughout BC AB and briefly the US winning many trophies with their champion Arabian show horse Star-Sirza.

In the mid-80's Mike met his life partner Betty Johnson and in the 90's they settled in the 150 Mile area. Mike and 2 good friends purchased the 150 Mile Hotel a rich piece of history in the Cariboo. Together they revived it into the 150 Mile Roadhouse & Pub. For years the establishment was a notable and lively gathering place where many good times were had.

Mike was a hardworking generous man who was always willing to help his friends and family.

He had a great sense of humour he was always up to something and he was entertaining to be around. Throughout his life he was fortunate to have made many friends many acquaintances and to have many great stories to tell. Mike will be sorely missed by his family and friends.

Mike was predeceased by his parents Mary and Peter and his stepfather John Ailport.

He is survived by his life partner Betty brother Chris (Sherri) sister Andrea son Chris (Jenica) daughter Jody (Joey) stepson Bryan (Dawn) three nieces (Susie Mia and Alison) five grandchildren (Jayden Utah Talon Pyper and Keyfer) and many friends.

Mike wished for his ashes to be spread at his favorite mule deer hunting spot a beautiful area overlooking the Fraser River.

At Mike's request there will be no service.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNubDI0LmNvbS9kcnVtL2Jvb2tzL2Jvb2stcmV2aWV3LXVwc3RhcnQtYnktYWxleGFuZHJpYS1wcm9jdGVyLWZvdW5kZXItb2YtZGlnc2Nvbm5lY3QtMjAyNDA1MDfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,BOOK REVIEW | Upstart by Alexandria Procter founder of DigsConnect | Drum,"In the tumultuous year of 2016 as universities grappled with the aftermath of the #FeesMustFall protests another crisis loomed large: the student housing crisis.

Procter & Gamble on Friday reported mixed quarterly results as it struggles to bring back shoppers after two years of hiking prices across its portfolio from Tide detergent to Charmin toilet paper.

The company's prices were up 3% compared with the year-ago period although CFO Andre Schulten said on a media call that P&G didn't institute any nationwide price hikes during the quarter.

Despite its disappointing sales the consumer giant raised its full-year outlook for earnings growth.

Shares of the company fell more than 1% in morning trading.

Here's what P&G reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $1.52 vs. $1.41 expected

Revenue: $20.2 billion vs. $20.41 billion expected

P&G reported fiscal third-quarter net income attributable to the company of $3.75 billion or $1.52 per share up from $3.4 billion or $1.37 per share a year earlier.

Net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion. Organic sales which strip out acquisitions divestitures and foreign currency increased 3% in the quarter.

But the company's quarterly volume was flat for the second consecutive quarter. In October executives said they anticipated returning to volume growth in fiscal 2024. Three quarters in the company hasn't yet lured back many of the customers it scared away with its price hikes over the last two years.

However three of P&G's divisions reported volume growth for the quarter. Its beauty segment which includes Olay and Pantene saw volume rise 1% fueled by innovation in personal care. The company's grooming business home to its Gillette and Venus razors reported volume growth of 2%. And fabric and home care which includes Febreze and Swiffer saw 1% volume growth.

But P&G's health care and baby feminine and family care divisions saw volume drop further. The company blamed its higher prices and a weaker cold and flu season for the declines.

Geography also played a role in the company's lackluster sales. China the company's second-largest market is still seeing softer demand for products like its pricey SK-II skin care. Schulten also said that some markets particularly in the Middle East have seen retailers pull back on promotions amid geopolitical tensions tied to the war in Gaza.

""The impact is visible but limited and we expect it to lessen obviously hopefully as these tensions ease over time"" he said.

My grandfather would pick guitar and I’d play fiddle usually in a circle of old-timers under a shade tree at the Summertown Bluegrass Reunion.

I lived on a small farm in Lawrenceburg Tenn. about 80 miles south of here. Like a lot of families we had a few animals a garden and some land; we weren’t professionals or anything. I lived in a trailer with my mom right in my grandparents’ front yard. I learned to raise goats and gut deer. Whenever we’d go to a swimming hole my Pepaw would point and say “I used to have a house there” because his parents were sharecroppers and they moved around.

As I got older it began to feel as if there were two parts of me and they didn’t get along. In high school my parents told me I was “a freak” for supporting marriage equality and in church I was told almost everything about me was a sin including my sexual orientation. I couldn’t come out and I was inundated with conservative rhetoric. I was a hillbilly — one used to hearing my family worry about paying the bills and making ends meet. I knew we struggled. But I couldn’t see how immigrants were the problem when it was the price of milk going up.

Welcome to this special edition of Neurology News Network. I’m Marco Meglio. Please excuse our appearance this week as a majority of the US workforce including the NeurologyLive team moves to working remote as we come together to help reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus.

Recently BrainEver announced that the FDA granted orphan drug designation to its investigational product BREN-02 the recombinant human homeoprotein Engrailed 1 (rhEN1) for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The product is expected to be initiated into clinical trials with patients with ALS in the second half of 2021 subject to preclinical toxicity results and regulatory review. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that the homeoprotein EN1 plays a role in the survival and maintenance of motor neuron-alpha spinal cells that innervate skeletal muscles.During development homeoprotein intercellular transfer influences cell migration and axon guidance whereas at post-natal and adult periods it controls cerebral cortex neuronal network plasticity. The company noted that these homeoproteins can also boost mitochondrial metabolism participate in the maintenance of physiological epigenic marks and limit the formulation of DNA breaks—a hallmark of aging.

Longitudinal analysis from a group of researchers at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine demonstrated that memory preservation in patients with primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is not just an incidental finding at onset but a core long-term feature despite hippocampo-entohinal Alzheimer disease (AD) neuropathology that is as severe as that of amnestic dementia with AD. Among a cohort of 17 PPA patients with autopsy or biomarker evidence of AD (PPA-AD) episodic memory tested with nonverbal items was preserved at initial testing and showed no decline at retesting 2.35 years later. At that point symptoms had been present for 6.26 years. Although memory preservation was observed in the PPA-AD group language functions declined significantly over the same period.

A recent study worked to define homogenous and clinically meaningful phenotypes of multiple sclerosis (MS) to improve measures and definitions over traditional dichotomous classifications. Ultimately after assessing 1212 patients the study identified 5 cognitive phenotypes. Preserved cognition was observed in 235 patients (19.4%) mild-verbal memory/semantic fluency was seen in 362 patients (29.9%) mild-multidomain involvement in 236 patients (19.5%) severe-executive attention in 167 patients (13.8%). and severe-multidomain in 212 patients (17.5%). Study author Maria A. Rocca MD and colleagues wrote that “in this cross-sectional study we propose a classification of cognitive functions in patients with MS that is based on the identification of distinct cognitive phenotypes.”

Not too long ago states like Wisconsin Michigan and Pennsylvania were considered Democratic strongholds and not swing states. And the strength that Democrats enjoyed in those states didn't just come from deep-blue urban areas either — Democratic politicians and policies were roundly popular with rural voters across the Midwest.

That rock-steady rural voting bloc which stood strong for most of the 20th century was a direct result of President Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal which delivered electricity infrastructure transportation and economic support to out-of-the-way rural areas. Because FDR promoted policies that delivered direct life-improving results to voters those voters and their families remained loyal for generations.

Pulling away from the Democratic party

It was only after decades of inattention from Democratic leaders and a full-court campaign by Republican politicians promoting the lie that trickle-down economics would solve rampant job losses and business closures that rural Wisconsin began to drift from the party.

In December of 2020 Bill Hogseth a political organizer from rural Wisconsin wrote an incisive essay for Politico Magazine about how Donald Trump's Republican Party won over rural Wisconsin. In it Hogseth accused the Democratic Party of not offering ""rural voters a clear vision that speaks to their lived experiences.""

Still Hogseth wrote the opportunity for Democrats to gain ground was there. Rural areas are ailing: ""Small-business growth has slowed in rural communities since the Great Recession and it has only worsened with COVID-19"" Hogseth wrote adding that as ""capital overwhelmingly flows to metro areas the small-town economy increasingly is dominated by large corporations: low-wage retailers like Dollar General or agribusiness firms that have no connection to the community.""

In this week's episode of ""Pitchfork Economics"" Civic Ventures president and Wisconsin native Zach Silk interviews Hogseth about the progressive economic policies that could help Democrats gain ground in the rural areas their forebears abandoned. It's a substantive conversation that transcends the usual calls for just dumping money blindly into America's heartland.

Allowing small businesses to thrive

Hogseth makes the great point that FDR's economic policy wasn't just about building infrastructure and handing out money to rural voters.

""The most important thing"" FDR did Hogseth explains is he ""fought concentration — the robber barons the previous generation of concentrated trust power."" This progressive push against monopolies and unchecked corporate power allowed family farms and small businesses to thrive throughout America's rural areas.

Less than a hundred years later here we are again: Rural areas in America are wastelands of small business with Walmarts and Dollar General stores wiping out all the competition in retail and gigantic agricultural corporations swallowing up family farms and replacing them with exploitative low-paying jobs and cruel and environmentally unsound farming practices.

Even though Joe Biden ran arguably the most progressive economic presidential campaign in three decades Hogseth says his conversations with voters on Biden's behalf in his rural Wisconsin community were still challenging.

""It was hard for us to point to something that was going to change their life in a measurable visible tangible way that was connected to their experience as a rural American"" Hogseth said.

""There's this overwhelming feeling amongst my neighbors that a lot of the decisions that affect their life are made somewhere else"" Hogseth said. ""Culture happens somewhere else capital flows somewhere else decisions are made somewhere else.""

For organizers like Hogseth in areas that Democrats have all but abandoned ""if you don't have some transformative vision or some big audacious plan for how you're going to change people's lives that you can point to when you're doing that work it makes the organizing really really difficult"" he said.

The challenge of reaching rural communities

Despite what the snobbiest urban progressive in your Facebook feed may claim the problem isn't that rural voters are idiots who have been brainwashed.

""The folks who I talked to around here — especially farmers for example — they really understand the way the economic system works"" Hogseth said.

And those farmers ""really understand how economic power works how the companies that they buy their fertilizer and seed from have pretty much monopolized that sector. Or they can't get the best price for their grain because there's only one or two buyers in the area"" Hogseth said.

It's not that they don't understand the monopolies are sucking the life out of their land and their livelihoods — it's that they understand exactly how powerful the corporate monopolies are and they don't believe Democrats will fight them on their behalf.

""There's significant economic power surrounding them and surrounding the communities that they live in"" Hogseth said. If Democrats aren't willing to take the risk and dismantle the unfair monopolies the farmers reason there's no point in voting for them.

Hogseth can attest that winning the heartland back isn't a matter of Democratic candidates finding the right words to say or the right stock footage of amber waves of grain to edit into their campaign commercials. And no matter what the Sunday morning news shows might claim it's not about identity politics or cancel culture or any of the other buzzwords that conservative pundits are trying to sell these days.

Rural voters care about action and taking a stand and living up to your words. Unless Democrats are willing to demonstrate that they're fighting for small businesses and independent farms and against job-killing market consolidation and corporate monopolies they'll never win back the rural areas that used to be steadfast Democratic strongholds.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmlpc2Qub3JnL2FydGljbGVzL2dlbmRlci1sZW5zLXN1c3RhaW5hYmxlLWludmVzdGluZ9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Integrating a Gender Lens in Sustainable Investing,"What are the gender-smart financing instruments today?

As the benefits of gender diversity have become more widely recognised investor demand for gender smart investment opportunities has increased considerably. This has led to the emergence of a variety of gender-focused financial products across asset classes. These products include gender lens funds gender smart exchange traded notes (ETNs) and exchange traded funds (ETFs) certificate of deposits gender bonds and private equity and debt funds with a focus on gender equality. In 2019 there were at least 192 active investment vehicles globally which is a 47 percent increase compared to 2018.

While the majority of these gender lens investment vehicles (80) are targeting the North American market the investment destination of 33 investment vehicles is East and Southeast Asia with a total USD 1.3 billion assets under management. At the same time the number of sustainable finance instruments has been growing rapidly in recent years reaching a total issuance of USD 2.1 billion (EY estimate) worth of green social and sustainability bonds. The overwhelming interest of local investors in these instruments highlights the opportunity for scaling up gender lens investing in the ASEAN region.

Bank OCBC NISP’s gender bond

Issuer: Bank OCBC NISP - fourth oldest bank in Indonesia

Size: IDR 2.75 trillion (about USD 200 million) – for both the gender and green bond tranche.

Date of issue: March 2020

Description: The proceeds from the gender bond were used to increase lending to women entrepreneurs and women-owned small and medium enterprises (SMEs). It was a private arrangement between Bank OCBC NISP and IFC.

Globally there are only a few examples of non-gender focused sustainable finance instruments that also integrate gender indicators. Perhaps unsurprisingly most of them are in impact investing which is a small but vibrant sustainable investment strategy with USD 444 billion AuM. For example WaterEquity an asset manager focuses on ending the global water and sanitation crisis while applying a gender lens when selecting investments. Another example is Alante a venture capital fund which invests in innovative companies that enable a sustainable future for apparel production and retail. At the same time it seeks to have gender diversity when selecting the founders it backs.

Outside of impact investing one notable example is the sustainability-linked subscription credit facility of the Swedish private equity firm EQT. The interest margin of the facility is linked to the average performance of EQT’s portfolio in renewable energy use (minimum 85 percent) and female board representation (minimum 40 percent) committing to both a gender and an environmental KPI. To date more mainstream sustainable finance instruments such as green bonds ESG ETFs do not include any gender considerations unless they have an explicit gender focus like in the case of gender bonds. At the same time there are some early ideas emerging which may gain traction in the coming years. One notable example is the “Green+ Gilt” that was proposed to Her Majesty’s Government in the UK with the support of 32 investors representing organizations with more than GBP 10 trillion AuM. Green+ Gilts are sovereign bonds used to finance climate action while addressing specific social objectives. These objectives could include creating high-quality employment and addressing income or potentially gender inequality. Integration of gender considerations especially makes sense for climate finance instruments like the Green+ Gilts as climate change impacts women disproportionately.

Green+ Gilt

The main objective of Green+ Gilts is to provide financing to deliver the UK government’s commitment to a resilient net-zero economy. Green project categories include clean infrastructure energy efficiency green buildings climate adaptation and natural capital.

Each eligible project would have at least one well defined and measurable social co-benefit with a relevant social metric for each project category. These could include outcomes such as affordable housing and infrastructure employment generation access to essential services skills development and education as well as other aspects of socioeconomic advancement.

Employees Can Claim LTC Scheme Benefits With Insurance



Morgan Stanley in one of its advertisements once said “You must pay your taxes but there’s no law that says you gotta leave a tip.”

Taxes are vital as no nation can prosper without it. However taking forward the argument from Morgan Stanley people should take advantage of the various tax exemptions that the government provides.

Before we highlight the benefits let me briefly explain taxable income and income tax liability. Let us suppose your taxable income which is the portion of your gross income that is taxed amounts to Rs 10 lakh. Your tax liability for the year would be computed based on this gross income and your income bracket. Now suppose a specific investment option provides tax benefit up to Rs 50000 per year. In that case it is deducted from your taxable income i.e. Rs 10 lakh. Thus your tax liability would now be calculated on Rs 9.5 lakh. Your taxable income reduces as you invest more in tax saving options.

Why Life Insurance?

One of the most sought after tax saving options is to purchase a life insurance policy. Life insurance offers protection and stability to policyholders and their loved ones. It also helps them achieve their long-term financial objectives. Life insurance can be a traditional savings plan designed for the risk-averse to unit-linked insurance policies offering market-linked returns.

On the income tax front premiums paid for life insurance policies are eligible for deduction under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act 1961. Individuals can claim deduction up to Rs 1.5lakh in a financial year. If the policy is compliant with Section 10 (10D) of the Income Tax Act 1961 the cover or sum assured and bonuses are entirely tax-free subject to certain conditions.

LTC reimbursement against premium

There are more tax exemptions on a life insurance policy. Premiums paid on life insurance policies bought by employees between October 12 2020 and March 31 2021 would be eligible for reimbursement under the Leave Travel Concession (LTC) scheme.

Here’s how it works:

If your LTC is Rs 50000 for 2020-21 you either produce travel tickets to claim it as a tax-free allowance or pay Rs 15000 tax on it if you are in the 30 per cent tax bracket. Instead the government has offered a window where you can avoid paying the tax without going on a vacation. However you need to spend three times your LTC allowance (i.e. Rs 1.5 lakh) to purchase goods and services that attract GST of 12 per cent or more.

Life Insurance is the only investment option which qualifies for the purpose of claiming the LTC benefit.

Conclusion

To sum up life insurance is designed to provide various benefits to you and your loved ones. It includes protection tax deductions and long-term savings all of which help safeguard your financial future. However before you buy a policy ask yourself why you need life insurance. Once you have answered find out how much insurance cover you need through most of your working life. The logical way to do this is to weigh your financial liabilities against your financial goals to arrive at your answer.

For starters the global economy has changed drastically over the last 25 years and continues to do so. The end of the Cold War encouraged free markets and capitalism as the world liberalised and globalised with some visible results of faster growth and reduced poverty. Then there was the global financial and economic crisis the collapse of commodity prices slowdown in aggregate demand and growth as well as rising inequality and unemployment.

The public policy responses have either been inadequate unresponsive or even raised so much social pain that politicians have found it inevitable but to abandon them. Britain has exited the European Union while Greece has used state machinery to deal with riots. Debt levels (both public and private) have increased and foreign reserves dwindled as imports continue to exceed exports. While the central bank is certainly not the cause of this emerging chaos it is central to the solution. After all it is the central bank! Question is how?

Zhou Xiaochuan has shared views on how China as a transitioning economy is grappling with the task of managing a multi-objective monetary policy that requires the central bank to stabilise the financial sector as well as effectively support economic growth. A discussion of a few could be good for Uganda.

First following the global financial crisis many central banks have gone beyond price stability and inflation targeting both inflation and nominal gross domestic product (GDP). This is because certain GDP variables such as the trade balance and associated exports and imports food production rising unemployment etc. often come out to haunt the central bank directly or otherwise. For example too much pressure from imports that is related to less domestic production and exports depreciates the shilling and leads to imported inflation.

Bank of Uganda has to proactively and assertively engage the mainstream of government – fiscal authorities – to behave in a way that moderates interest rates and lowers economic risks so as to promote adequate private investment and production. An uncoordinated fiscal policy leads to passive overreliance on monetary policy – making the central bank reactive all the time rather than proactive.

While it may be prudent to lower interest rates to promote investment Bank of Uganda is left with the reverse option which becomes more catastrophic leading to defaults by distressed private companies and political requests for financial bailouts.

Second how and when should the central bank be independent? Xiaochuan argues that once the central bank adopts multiple objectives it is harder to be immune from the political realities. Multiple objectives require more coordination and joint efforts with other government agencies and regulators. However functions such as macro-prudential and financial regulation are too sensitive and must remain as clear mandates for the central bank.",,,

Fosrich CEO Cecil Foster says the agreement gives it exclusive right to distribute and install PV solutions otherwise called solar systems in the local market inclusive of inverters to convert solar generated power for regular use; digital switches and panels monitoring devices and lithium-ion batteries for power storage.

“Huawei is partnering with us through their brand Fusion Solar to bring photovoltaic power products and panels to the local market. We’ll be able to do large scale industrial and governmental operations Foster told the Financial Gleaner.

“That means we can cover from the factory to the office and the home” he said following the announcement of the distribution arrangement on Thursday on the final day of the Jamaica Stock Exchange 16th Regional Investments and Capital Markets Conference in New Kingston.

Director of Enterprise Business Group for Huawei Northern and Western Caribbean Courtney Hamilton said the company had been on the lookout for a distributor with clout in the Jamaican market and says the arrangement positions the Chinese company to expand its footprint. The company is already in the Caribbean supplying telephone equipment and cellular infrastructure.

“As world leaders in the photovoltaic power generation space we want to supply the entire ecosystem for solar power except the panels which we currently don’t do. What we’re supplying will make sure that customers will have a totally digital solar plant” Hamilton said.

Jamaica’s alternative energy market continues to evolve with both wind and solar systems. The market is estimated at over $4 billion energy sources say with solar systems being more ubiquitous having been adopted by both households and industrial users as a cheaper source of energy over supplies of electricity from the national grid.

The inverters to be supplied by FosRich will range from small 3-kilowatt units for household use to 100 kW units for commercial applications according to Hamilton. He said the partnership would start out small then scale up as business grows.

“The original investment for inventory is about $15 million but we expect that to grow exponentially as the market responds and the relationship grows” he said.

Solar technology has got cheaper over the years but Foster says has no plan to compete at the low-end against easily procurable solar panels. His sights are on building contractors and clients of that nature.

“What we are committing to do is deliver premium quality products at lower competitive prices. FosRich distributing for Huawei is better and much different from someone buying off the Internet. We want that growing market out there to come to us” he said.

FosRich has been in business for more than 25 years and is now turning over annual revenue of more than $1.8 billion. The junior stock market company supplies lighting and power equipment for home and commercial use but in recent years it has ventured into the manufacturing of PVC pipes and conduits as well as the repair of power transformers on behalf of starter client Jamaica Public Service Company.

We’re not kidding ourselves when it comes to North Texas’ ranking for snowbird destinations. We know that the Dallas-Fort Worth area doesn’t necessarily work for the snowbirding lifestyle.

It can be uncomfortably hot. It’s vast. No ocean. It’s not Florida.

So when STORAGECafé released its list of best 2021 snowbird destinations Texas as a state ranked third with 17 cities in the top-100 best destinations but you had to search hard for a D-FW presence. Texas cities were the usual suspects along the Gulf of Mexico coast.

Of the 17 Texas cities one North Texas suburb managed to crack the list — the town of Flower Mound at 68th.

Corpus Christi was the top Texas city at ninth.

STORAGECafé is the self-storage division of internet listing service RENTCafé. STORAGECafé looked at data such as average temperatures during winter months percentage of houses designated for seasonal use out of vacant housing stock access to beaches parks and golf courses health and safety indicators availability of self-storage and the Surgo Foundation’s COVID-19 community vulnerability index.

Based on those factors Boca Raton Fla. was the No. 1 spot with an aggregate score of 60.32. Flower Mound totaled 123.94 scoring high on safety and low on beach length (0 miles).

Flower Mound’s inclusion makes sense for a snowbird.

The town has interstate access to DFW International Airport and has several VRBO seasonal listings. In the era of physical distancing Flower Mound’s outdoor perks and suburban-town feel can attract snowbirds.

Snowbirds can pretend they’re on an ocean coast by taking in activities on the north shore of Lake Grapevine or nearby Lake Lewisville. These lakes are no match for Corpus Christi which has 39 miles of shoreline but in defense of Flower Mound water is water.

Flower Mound features two public 18-hole golf courses — Bridlewood Golf Club and Tour 18 Dallas. Other courses and driving ranges are within easy driving distance of Flower Mound.

Bridlewood Golf Club is an 18-hole public course in Flower Mound (facebook.com/bridlewoodgolf)

Flower Mound ranked better in most-affordable snowbird cities at 58th. According to Yardi Matrix data the average monthly rent for a stay between October 2019 to March 2020 was $1602 in Flower Mound.

In contrast the South Texas cities of Brownsville Harlingen and McAllen are the top three affordable living options. The top six most-affordable snowbird cities are in Texas with average monthly rent from October 2019 to March 2020 ranging from $730 to $876.

This all fits into a recent University of Texas study on visitors spending the winter in the Rio Grande Valley. The study defines the Valley’s winter Texan as around 72 years of age married in a two-person household and with an average annual household income of about $65000. These winter visitors roll in from Canada Minnesota Iowa Missouri Illinois and Michigan.

Despite the pandemic Snowbird Advisor forecasts that 31 percent of its members still plan to relocate this winter.

Making up for fewer snowbirds are a growing number of remote workers who can work anywhere.

Angela Durko

“What we’re seeing isn’t just snowbirds relocating now but rather the ‘Zoomcation’ or Remote Worker relocation trend” Angela Durko a Texas A&M University associate professor who specializes in marketing and tourism told STORAGECafé. “Previously it was typically a retiree traveling via RV or to a second home from the North to locations like Arizona or Florida for the winter.

“Now it’s the young couple who are both working from home the family with children who opted for virtual learning or the business professional who has never had the time to leave their desk job all with a newfound freedom to work/educate from the location of their choosing.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndpbm5tZWRpYXNrbi5jb20vcHVibGljLXdvcmtzLWRpcmVjdG9yLXN0cm9uZ2x5LWVuY291cmFnZXMtaG9tZW93bmVycy10by1pbnN0YWxsLWNpc3Rlcm4tb3Itd2F0ZXItc3RvcmFnZS10YW5rcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Public Works Director Strongly Encourages Homeowners to Install Cistern or Water Storage Tanks | WINNFM 98.9,"Basseterre St. Kitts (SKNIS): Homebuilders in St. Kitts and Nevis are strongly encouraged to include a cistern or water storage tanks in their building design to promote sustainability and address water shortages.

A cistern is a large tank or a container that is used for water storage.

The twin-island Federation and other Caribbean countries have experienced reduced rainfall over the past five years which experts suggest is a consequence of climate change. As such Director of the Public Works Department (PWD) Cromwell Williams strongly endorsed building with cisterns.

“You should consider it when you are building” he said on this week’s (January 27 2021) edition of the radio and television programme Working for You. “There can be no argument against that. I strongly recommend persons to give that some serious consideration – including a cistern when you are building your house.”

Mr. Williams extended the recommendation to persons that already own a house of their own. Having a backup water supply “is definitely the way to go” he stated.

To reinforce the usefulness of a cistern the PWD Director referred to the implementation of a climate change adaptation project in September 2020. The project involved the installation of water storage tanks and the retrofitting of others in 17 educational institutions across the twin-island Federation.

Several health institutions including the Mary Charles Hospital in Molineux also have water storage tanks.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFmci5jb20vcHJvcGVydHkvY29tbWVyY2lhbC9keWxkYW0tY2VvLXNhbS1mYXlhZC1mYWNpbmctYmFua3J1cHRjeS10aHJlYXQtMjAyMTAxMjktcDU2eHU40gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dyldam CEO Sam Fayad facing bankruptcy threat,"Dyldam Development boss Sam Fayad is facing the threat of bankruptcy after being ordered by the NSW Supreme Court to pay a debt of $1.6 million.

Amazon Alexa will be a native component of Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon Automotive Cockpit Platforms providing the basis for voice assistants in cars built by General Motors and other automotive manufacturers. Qualcomm will be the second company to design a custom branded voice assistant using Amazon’s new Alexa Custom Assistant platform after it rolled out with Fiat Chrysler earlier in January.

Driving Qualcomm

The Qualcomm Snapdragon Automotive Cockpit Platforms is the chipmaker’s latest setup for car companies that want custom voice assistants in their vehicles. Qualcomm was already working with Amazon to bring its Alexa Automotive SDK to cars but the new system advances the technology and gives the resulting AI access to all of Alexa’s capabilities while still being branded by the car company. That means the wake word features voice sound and other elements can align with the company’s brand but still use the Alexa Skills Kit to adjust it. Qualcomm adds some flavor to the final platform with voice identification and personalization while the echo cancellation noise suppression feature even lets multiple people talk at the same time without confusing the AI. Qualcomm’s chip also includes updates over the air to improve how the car’s AI operates in the future.

“The hallmark of Qualcomm Technologies for the automotive industry is the ability to transform those valued personalized experiences with smart devices for today’s personal vehicles” Qualcomm senior vice president and automotive general manager Nakul Duggal said in a statement. “This latest optimization of Alexa Custom Assistant with Snapdragon Automotive Cockpit Platforms allows for smarter customized and natural interactions between drivers and vehicles which nurtures a stronger driver-to-vehicle relationship.”

Custom Chips

The renewed and extended deal shows how Amazon relies on services from firms like Qualcomm even though there’s a shift beginning to happen in who makes AI chips. Amazon announced in November that it was moving most of its Alexa operations onto the Inferentia computer chip produced in-house and away from the Nvidia chips used by Alexa before. The point was to boost speed and reduce energy demands. Inferentia chips specialize in the machine learning tasks like recognizing language and images and generating an appropriate response all crucial to Alexa. Meanwhile Qualcomm’s partnership with Google is might change if Google’s partnership with Samsung to design a new chip for Pixel smartphones and Chromebook computers ends with Google replacing the Qualcomm-built chips used right now. But for Amazon the effort to bring get Alexa Custom Assistant into the hands of more companies makes arrangements with the chip makers with deep ties to car companies as Qualcomm does with General Motors an indispensable step.

“We created the Alexa Custom Assistant in response to growing demand for bespoke digital experiences that are unique to a brand while leveraging the world-class Alexa technology stack” Alexa Automotive vice president Ned Curic said. “The pre-integration of the Alexa Custom Assistant with Snapdragon Automotive Cockpit Platforms is designed to reduce the cost complexity and time it takes for automotive OEMs to offer their customers the choice and flexibility of simultaneous intelligent assistants.”

This dominance has been made possible partly by the extraordinary amount of R&D the company does in India. Its 10000 employees across centres in Bengaluru Hyderabad Chennai and Noida account for about a quarter of the total Qualcomm workforce. The India R&D operation is the largest outside of the San Diego headquarters.

Dhananjay Gore VP of engineering at Qualcomm India says over the past decade the company has spent around 20% of its annual revenue in R&D and engineering efforts. “This has allowed us to drive innovations in cellular technologies like 4G and 5G"" he says.

Gore leads wireless systems and hardware IP development at Qualcomm India for 4G/5G cellular and wireless LAN modems. He also oversees research efforts spanning 5G machine learning and augmented & virtual reality. ""We have large teams across hardware and software engineering. Our centres in India work on massive collaborative projects with the other global R&D centres in the design and development of high-tech solutions on mobile products cellular technologies and in the application space as well like advanced camera video and graphic systems and CPU design"" he says. Qualcomm's flagship chipsets like the Snapdragon mobile platform and a host of others were developed with the help of the India R&D teams.

With the pandemic pushing companies towards work-from-home connectivity solutions have taken on new importance. One of the big areas that Qualcomm's India centres work on is WiFi. The world is currently at the end of the fifth generation of WiFi technology and companies like Qualcomm are working on the hardware and software components for WiFi 6 or the 802.11ax standard.

""As standards for WiFi evolve so do the products and use cases by companies. You need advanced software design on top of your hardware to enable those use cases. The India teams work on the hardware design system engineering aspects and software-enablement of this hardware. We also have large labs in India for testing to make sure that what is being built is built to spec and can be certified for WiFi products"" says Gore.

Teams here have also worked on engineering solutions within the Indian context to enable a robust mobile handset ecosystem for the country. We are a price conscious market Gore says and so you need chipset solutions that can enable segmented product lines.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNueC1zb2Z0d2FyZS5jb20vMjAyMS8wMS8zMC9zbmFwZHJhZ29uLTg4OC1tb2JpbGUtaGFyZHdhcmUtZGV2ZWxvcG1lbnQta2l0LXNoaXBzLXdpdGgtMTJnYi1yYW0tMjU2Z2ItdWZzLXN0b3JhZ2Uv0gGDAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNueC1zb2Z0d2FyZS5jb20vMjAyMS8wMS8zMC9zbmFwZHJhZ29uLTg4OC1tb2JpbGUtaGFyZHdhcmUtZGV2ZWxvcG1lbnQta2l0LXNoaXBzLXdpdGgtMTJnYi1yYW0tMjU2Z2ItdWZzLXN0b3JhZ2UvP2FtcD0x?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Snapdragon 888 Mobile Hardware Development Kit ships with 12GB RAM 256GB UFS storage,"Snapdragon 888 is the latest premium mobile SoC from Qualcomm with the octa-core processor combining one Cortex-X1 core three Cortex-A78 cores and four low-power Cortex-A55 cores with Adreno 660 GPU and Snapdragon X60 5G modem.

Below the emails and guidelines provided by UNH are broken down as a comprehensive return to campus guide.

HOUSING:

For students living in on-campus housing move-in is taking place over the course of four days Jan. 27 through Jan. 30. The first day of school for students is Feb. 1. On-campus housing restrictions remain the same as were stated during the fall semester. Students will not be allowed to have any non-university guests or family members enter the residential halls. As stated at the beginning of the year there is a limit to the number of students allowed in dorm lounges and common spaces at a time and the dorm kitchens have been closed for the year. All rooms will remain at single or double occupancy regardless of the size the space may offer.

The housing teams has been working closely with the Dean of Students’ office and the COVID-19 testing compliance team throughout winter break to make sure expectations are as clear as possible for students and so that the entire transition is smooth.

“Housing and residential life have been carefully planning fun events and programs that align with our safety practices” said Victoria Perkins the interim director of housing. “We want very much for students to enjoy their time living on campus while feeling very comfortable knowing that we are making their safety-first priority. Housing and residential life have also been a part of the planning to ensure that the Wildcat Pass is more comprehensive more user-friendly and that the policies around testing compliance are strict but manageable for every student.”

TESTING PROTOCOLS:

Like last semester students must have a valid Wildcat Pass to be anywhere on campus. The testing guidelines outlined by the university are the necessary steps for a student to have a valid Wildcat Pass come Feb. 1. In the last email sent out by Kenneth Holmes the Senior Vice Provost of Student Life and Kate Ziemer The Senior Vice Provost of Academic Affairs the two provided a quick checklist for students. The list of reminders included:

Signing the Wildcat Pledge which is a required step for students. The Wildcat Pledge states “This confirms your commitment to participate in regular COVID-19 testing and follow all federal state and university public health protocols around physical distancing face coverings and gatherings. If a student does not sign the pledge they will not have a valid Wildcat Pass and will not be permitted on any of our campuses. All employees are encouraged to sign the pledge to show support for our students and the university’s #UNHTogether campaign.” Students are required to answer one yes/no question that asked “Do you agree to uphold the Wildcat Community Pledge and follow all guidelines? Students: This includes Student Rights Rules and Responsibilities?” This is the first mandated step into achieving a valid Wildcat Pass.

As for pre-arrival and arrival testing there are different rules for students who do not live within a 90-mile radius of the university. For students who live outside the 90-mile radius they were required to have a Quest Diagnostic self-testing kit sent to their permanent address. If the student’s result came back negative they were asked to prove this and then select an arrival date for testing and test pick-up. Students who live in a 90-mile radius of the university were able to schedule an appointment at the Whittemore Center between Jan. 19-24 8 a.m. – 5 p.m. These students picked up a self-testing kit and were asked to complete it and drop it off at any UNH testing drop-off location. Students could also upload proof of a negative test result; however the university made it clear that this option was at the expense of the student. Those who continued to test throughout winter break and J-term were asked to keep testing and were not required to set-up a pre-arrival test. All students were then asked to pick a date and time for an arrival test and to pick-up their testing kits for the spring semester.

Everyone is required to update their profile for their Wildcat Pass and sign the quarantine attestation.

Students then confirm their regular testing schedule with the university based off their college. If the two days per week that their college is required to submit tests does not work for this student they may file a petition to change dates with a valid reason.

The testing schedule is as follows:

College of Health and Human Services: Monday and Thursday mornings

College of Life Sciences and Agriculture/Thompson School: Monday and Thursday afternoons

College of Engineering and Physical Sciences: Tuesday and Friday mornings

Paul College of Business and Economics: Tuesday and Friday afternoons

College of Liberal Arts: Wednesday and Saturday mornings

Carsey NRESS Graduate Interdisciplinary Programs Continuing Education or no college designation: Monday and Thursday afternoons

Finally everyone must make sure they have a valid Wildcat Pass. If your pass is invalid the website will tell you what needs to be fixed or completed in order for your pass to be validated.

On Jan. 20 the university went from an orange mode of operation back to yellow. The yellow mode of operation is known as “restricted” and means that cases are low on and off campus and that the campus is in full operation with a student focus. All restrictions put in place by UNH are in the best interest of students faculty and staff so that the university can remain open for in-person/hybrid learning for the spring of 2021.

RJF,Raymond James,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDEzbmV3cy5jb20vbmV3cy9kZXNwaXRlLWxpbWl0ZWQtYXR0ZW5kYW5jZS1yYXltb25kLWphbWVzLXN0YWRpdW0td2lsbC1sb29rLWNyb3dkZWQtc3VwZXItYm93bC1zdW5kYXnSAXdodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3gxM25ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvZGVzcGl0ZS1saW1pdGVkLWF0dGVuZGFuY2UtcmF5bW9uZC1qYW1lcy1zdGFkaXVtLXdpbGwtbG9vay1jcm93ZGVkLXN1cGVyLWJvd2wtc3VuZGF5LmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Despite limited attendance Raymond James Stadium will look crowded Super Bowl Sunday,"The preparations at Raymond James Stadium continue as Super Bowl LV gets closer. This year only 22000 ticketed fans will be in attendance but you may notice that the stands still look full. That’s because the NFL decided to fill a majority of the empty seats with fan cutouts to represent those who can’t be at the big game.

On Sunday crews were hard at work installing the cutouts throughout Raymond James Stadium. It is no small task. Despite spending the majority of the day installing the cutouts crews told FOX 13 that the work is far from over. They plan to be at the stadium every day until Saturday evening so that once gameday rolls around the stands will look full.

The cutouts serve two unique purposes. The NFL first wanted to make sure they represented those who couldn’t be in attendance and also honored local heroes. Different sections represent different groups of people such as healthcare workers or military heroes. Celebrity cutouts will also be installed randomly throughout the rows.

""We have local football representatives that play football we have healthcare heroes that are represented and we have the military salute to service represented as well. We have a couple of other different causes integrated there and then will have some celebrities and all the NFL all-time team and Super Bowl MVPs. It’s quite a diverse mix of folks that we are trying to represent but also support and honor"" explained Jason Baker the director of execution with Blue Media.

The cutouts also serve as social distancing barriers for the ticketed fans who will be in attendance.

Once the Super Bowl is over crews will then get to work removing all the cut-outs from the stands. They estimate that it will probably take about two days to get all the fans from the seats. However they aren’t just throwing the cutouts in the trash.

RELATED NFL Super Bowl fan experience officially opens for football fans along Riverwalk

The cutouts are made from recycled plastic so that they can withstand high heat winds and rain. After the big game is over the cutouts will be recycled in Tampa so they can be converted into energy.

As of Sunday fans are no longer able to purchase a cutout to be in the stands for the big game. For the lucky ones who do have a cutout in a seat the NFL will release a high-resolution photo of the stadium following the game. Fans who have a cutout in the stands will then be able to search the crowd for their cutout.

Being from the Tampa Bay area the Kunzigs posed for a photo next to the sign which is in the Lamar Hunt Super Bowl Gallery.

The Buccaneers had signed Tom Brady and Rob Gronkowski. Tampa was set to host the Super Bowl. Could this be the year?

Destiny posted the photo on Facebook and wrote ""The Hall of Fame is going to have to take this down after February 2021.""

""It’s something we’ll be changing"" Hall of Fame spokesman Rich Desrosiers said in an email. ""Big Nasty was prescient!""

Ford Hall of Fans

The Kunzigs were in Canton because Keith who is known to his fellow Tampa Bay Buccaneers fans at Big Nasty now is part of the Ford Hall of Fans display at the Pro Football Hall of Fame. With him last September was Janel Carbajo — known as the Puppet Lady among her fellow Kansas City Chief fans.

Next Sunday Carbajo's Chiefs and Kunzig's Buccaneers face off in Super Bowl LV.

While neither Hall of Fans member expects to be inside Raymond James Stadium both will be in the Tampa area. It's easy for Kunzig because he lives in nearby Largo. Carbajo and her husband Tom planned ahead to visit friends anticipating the possibility of a Kansas City repeat.

Because of the Ford Hall of Fans competition both were in Miami last year giving Carbajo a chance to see her favorite team come from behind to claim the Lombardi Trophy with a 31-20 win over the San Francisco 49ers.

As Kansas City closed in on the win Kunzig shot video of Janel and her husband Tom celebrating. He watched the Buccaneers beat the — at least then — Oakland Raiders 48-21 in San Diego in 2003 and made the video so Carbajo could relive the moment.

""Janel is so animated. It's an amazing feeling when your team wins. When you're in the moment you don't realize you're so excited"" Kunzig said.

Longtime season ticket holders

Both fans are longtime season ticket holders for their favorite teams.

Puppet Lady came to be when the Carbajos took their then 2-year-old daughter to games. Janel brought along boxing robots to keep the toddler amused. Eventually she put jerseys on the robots. That caught the attention of stadium and television cameras.

Attending Kansas City games became a regular family outing Carbajo said. While the family didn't see home games this season because of the coronavirus pandemic they arranged to be at both home playoff games that paved the way for this year's Super Bowl.

Carbajo said her voice was shot for two weeks from cheering on her team. Even with a limited crowd and fans spaced in sections Arrowhead Stadium was filled with noise.

""It was so good to be back in the stadium"" she said. ""It was rocking and rolling so it was a lot of fun.""

Kunzig was able to take in five of the Tampa home games this season but had to watch from home when the team took to the road for the playoffs.

In November after the Buccaneers lost three games over a four-week stretch and saw their record drop to 7-5 Kunzig went to lunch at Bassano Cheesecake a popular spot in the Tampa Bay area. The Buccaneers beat the Vikings the following week starting a seven-game win streak that ran through the playoffs to the Super Bowl.

Superstition kicked in. Kunzig has been to Bassano every week since sitting in the same seat and ordering the same food. Meanwhile the restaurant now offers the Big Nasty Oreo Cheesecake.

""You never mess with a win streak"" Kunzig said.

Kansas City beat Tampa Bay 27-24 before kicking off the win streak. Kunzig is hopeful because the Buccaneers are on a streak and have Brady who will be playing in his 10th Super Bowl and has won six.

""We'll be ready this time"" Kunzig said. ""We're looking forward to the second time around with these guys.""

Carbajo knows her team faces a challenge. Kansas City lost offensive tackle Eric Fisher in the Bills game. Tampa has Brady and home field advantage. She hopes Kansas City can build a lead and hold on. Last year's come-from-behind win was fun but nerve-racking.

""Last year was a miracle"" Carbajo said of the Super Bowl win. ""But this is even better.""

Where will they watch?

Carbajo and Kunzig hope they can meet sometime this week. Both are excited to be part of the atmosphere of another Super Bowl.

Kunzig has been busy with local promotional events since the Buccaneers entered the playoffs after a 13-year absence. Carbajo hopes to visit the NFL Experience if she can get tickets.

Super Bowl tickets are commanding thousands of dollars and the number is limited because of the coronavirus pandemic. Only 22000 were made available and 7500 of those are going to vaccinated health care workers and first responders.

Because of the low ticket count and steep prize Carbajo and Kunzig doubt they'll be able to watch the Super Bowl in person.

Kunzig figures he might have a chance because he's in a drawing for an opportunity to buy tickets. ""You're gonna be the same as a lottery winner if you get one of those tickets"" he said.

Carbajo expects to watch the game with friends who live in the Tampa area.

If Kunzig doesn't win in the ticket lottery he's going to watch from his home with family and friends. Before the game he'll drink a toast to his brother Kenny who for years accompanied him to games as Little Nasty. Kenny died in January 2020.

Kunzig is confident his brother was there as the Buccaneers streaked to the playoffs and Super Bowl.

""I believe he's with us"" Kunzig said. ""I really do.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRhbXBhYmF5LmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvYnVjcy8yMDIxLzAxLzMwL2J1Y3Mtbm90LWJ1Y2tzLXdpdGgtYS1wYW5kZW1pYy1zdXBlci1ib3dsLXRhbXBhLW1pc3Nlcy1hbi1lY29ub21pYy13aW5kZmFsbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bucs not bucks: With a pandemic Super Bowl Tampa misses an economic windfall,"For Brandon Ahlgren seeing the Tampa Bay Buccaneers advance to Super Bowl 55 was the best possible outcome from a bad situation.

Before the pandemic his company Elite Events and Rentals was close to signing contracts to provide tents and fencing for several Super Bowl events in Tampa — enough that he would have had to hire additional employees and buy new equipment.

Then came months of wait-and-see and eventually cancellations. Elite pivoted to tenting COVID-19 testing sites and got a federally backed relief loan worth $221250 to stay afloat. But Ahlgren still had to cut staff from 50 to 12 even with Super Bowl weekend on the horizon.

Only after the Bucs won the NFC Championship becoming the first NFL team to reach a Super Bowl in their home stadium did Ahlgren’s phone really start buzzing.

“Instead of doing large events now we’re doing backyard parties” he said. “There’s nothing wrong with that; it helps keep employees employed. But we are doing the minimum compared to what we would normally do in a situation where the Bucs are going to the Super Bowl locally.”

For business owners like Ahlgren this Super Bowl — planned out for years yet in countless ways unpredictable — is the capper on a frustrating year in the economic ecosystem of Tampa Bay sports.

Major events like WrestleMania and the NCAA men’s basketball tournament were lost. The Lightning won the Stanley Cup in Canada and the Rays reached the World Series in Texas. All those out-of-town visitors all those hotel stays all that business for the region: Poof.

Now comes a slimmed-down Super Bowl with fewer fans fewer parties and many fewer millions changing hands. The historic involvement of the hometown Bucs should spur last-minute economic activity at the local level. But for most businesses it’ll be more of a silver lining than a once-in-a-lifetime windfall.

“It’s sad because it’s like Halley’s Comet: When will Tampa have another Super Bowl?” said Chris Visser a veteran sports marketer and key figure in the Super Bowl hype machine known as Radio Row. “It is really really heartbreaking for this city that has had so much to be able to show off from the World Series to the Stanley Cup to now the Super Bowl.”

It’s not Tampa’s fault he said.

“Everybody’s health comes first absolutely” he said. “But it is kind of a perfect storm of heartbreak.”

Most likely millions lost

The economic impact of any Super Bowl has long been a matter of debate. The NFL and host committees around the country have put it at close to $400 million; independent economic studies have argued it’s far less.

Local boosters remain optimistic in the game’s potential to shine a light on the region and spur future business even if expectations are scaled back.

“We may not see that economic boom but we have that once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to be on the world stage” Tampa Mayor Jane Castor said.

Ex-Buc Derrick Brooks the co-chairman of the city’s Super Bowl host committee pointed to more than $2 million that’s come to town through various NFL community initiatives. And Rob Higgins executive director of the Tampa Bay Sports Commission called business surrounding the game “a shot in the arm when we need it the most.”

Eight months ago Santiago Corrada the CEO of Visit Tampa Bay speculated that the economic impact of all local events from October 2020 through September 2021 would be around $231 million with the Super Bowl representing up to quarter of that. Today with a stadium a third full and the home team in the game Visit Tampa Bay won’t put a guesstimate on it.

“There are lots of cities that if they could would change places with us because of what the pandemic has wrought on the tourism industry” Corrada said. “To start off 2021 with an event of this caliber and the media exposure that you get through it — look at just by the Bucs winning all of the media exposure we’ve got on the sports side — we’re making history here.”

There’s little to compare it to. Ken Jones was CEO of the 2012 Republican National Convention in Tampa and an adviser to the 2020 convention in Charlotte part of which was nearly moved to Jacksonville. When the latter event was all but canceled in August he said the city likely lost out on hundreds of millions of dollars.

“None of those hotel rooms all the catering all the restaurants all the events — none of that stuff happened” he said. “It didn’t happen in Jacksonville either. In that instance the economic impact was definitely muted.”

The Super Bowl is different he said because unlike Charlotte Tampa will still host thousands of league employees media support staff and at least a few thousand ticketholders willing to shell out five figures for a seat. Those folks will spend money somewhere.

“Is it the same as if you could sell out Raymond James and do corporate hospitality? No it’s not” Jones said. “But in my view it’s still very significant.”

Veteran event producers Talent Resources Sports organized lavish Super Bowl parties for Sports Illustrated and Bloomberg last year in Miami and was planning to do the same this year. The company was “extremely bullish on Tampa” said CEO David Spencer but the health risk was too great.

“Any given event that we’re doing we’re spending anywhere between $1.5 million and $4.5 million per event and I would say probably 75 to 80 percent of that is going back into the local economy for the vendors that we’re working with” he said. “There is obviously a big trickle-down effect by not being able to host these events. I know there are some events and some people that are willing to take that risk but I could never live with a situation where somebody could come to our event and get sick or even worse.”

This year’s game almost didn’t take place in Tampa at all. In 2016 Super Bowl 55 was awarded to Los Angeles which had not yet completed its new stadium for the Rams and Chargers. A year later construction delays forced the NFL to move the game to Florida.

Imagine the chaos had this year’s Super Bowl been slated for locked-down California instead of largely open Florida. The economic loss might have been even greater.

“Put the politics aside — allowing us to have events safely has been huge” said Elite Events’ Ahlgren. “If not I don’t know if we’d still be in business.”

The home field advantage

The Buccaneers reaching the game in their home market is an intangible that no one knows how to factor in.

After the Kansas City Chiefs advanced to the Super Bowl American Airlines and Southwest Airlines added extra flights from Kansas City to Tampa International Airport. Had another NFC team beaten the Bucs that would have meant more flights from another city — and more out-of-towners in local hotels. A successful Super Bowl Corrada said would bring about 80 percent to 90 percent hotel bed occupancy in Hillsborough County. As of this week the county was at 50 percent.

“It’s a catch-22” said Michael Mondello a marketing professor with the Vinik Sport and Entertainment Management Program at the University of South Florida. “You’ve got the local team here so you’ve got a whole fan base that’s not coming here at all. But then you’ve got maybe more local people who are more interested and enthused about it so you may get a lot of people in the Tampa-St. Pete area just being out in the community.”

In St. Petersburg Ferg’s Sports Bar owner Mark Ferguson said attendance for watch parties steadily increased during the Bucs’ playoff run to the point where Super Bowl Sunday will have ticketed entry. While the city has clamped down on other Super Bowl parties forcing Ferg’s to cancel a rock concert in its courtyard Ferguson said he’s getting a sense of encouragement around the game itself.

“Things are changing every day” he said. “I still have to go through all the issues of getting permits but it looks like the city wants to have a big party outside because there’s so many TV and radio (stations) that are going to follow them. So for the exposure they’re going to give us more wiggle room.”

The World of Beer near International Plaza and Tampa International Airport is planning a weekend of indoor and outdoor watch parties including one with a giant outdoor screen for the game. Permit applications filed with the city call for crowds of up to 1000.

“We’ve been working on this for a little over a month and a half now but it’s much more amplified now that it’s the Bucs” said marketing manager Emily Barth.

Other event organizers downscaled to manage expectations — even those with Buccaneer ties.

Maven Sports Group whose clients include the Bucs’ Mike Evans originally planned to throw a star-studded party on Clearwater Beach. COVID-19 spikes forced the group to scale back to an invite-only party a golf tournament and a series of socially distanced pop-up events.

“It’s not about making a huge financial windfall or profit” said Terry Johnson one of Maven’s event organizers. “In the traditional way without COVID we’d go: ‘Does it make good business sense? Can we make a certain profit? Can we cover ourselves?’ You answer that question and then you move forward. In the pandemic that can’t be the priority. Because if you do it the logical way the answer is no.”

With the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines in 2021 this year’s pandemic Super Bowl might be just an economic aberration with Tampa the unlucky city that caught it.

Almost as soon as Talent Resources Sports called off its party plans Spencer set his sights on Super Bowl 56 in Los Angeles. There event companies are already “doubling down” on plans for much more lavish parties he said in part because of all the money they’re saving this year in Tampa.

“People are ready to burst at the seams to go back out and socialize and to reinvest in the event space” he said.

Next year’s Super Bowl he predicted might be one of the biggest ever.

After his Tampa Bay Buccaneers’ NFC Championship victory over the Green Bay Packers the 43-year-old future Hall of Fame quarterback rushed to the stands for a hug from his 13-year-old son Jack.

“Can I say hi to my son?” asked Brady who climbed the barrier to embrace his oldest boy — already gaining on him in height — and tell him “Love you kiddo.”

Friends of the multimillionaire quarterback told The Post that Jack is Brady’s Mini-Me.

Added one: “He has got his dad’s long legs and he’s really talented. I don’t know if he’ll be a professional footballer player because can you imagine the pressure that comes with being Tom Brady’s son?”

After the post-game moment Brady talked to Westwood One Radio about Jack: “Oh man he’s such a trooper. A good friend of mine my friend Tom Wagner was flying to the game and he said ‘I wonder if Jack can come? We’ll be in and out the same day.’ And Jack was all in. He came and watched sitting out in the freezing cold and was just so happy at the end …

“He’s a special kid. I love my family. Obviously I love my team and there’s just no greater feeling than to spend those moments with all of us together after a great win.”

Jack’s mom actress Bridget Moynahan seemed equally excited. “Could not be more proud @tombrady said he would do it and he did. Congratulations @buccaneers” she posted on Instagram.

There was a time when such camaraderie and support seemed unthinkable. Her followers certainly knew that too.

“So awesome to watch you both navigate your lives in such a supportive respectful way! High praise! Can’t be easy living in the spotlight” one wrote. “You’re a great role model for kindness and forgiveness” posted another. As nearly 30000 “likes” ticked up one person added: “Have not been a Tom Brady fan because of how he treated you in the past. If you can cheer for him today I can too. It was a great win!”

Moynahan now 49 found out she was pregnant with John “Jack” Edward in February 2007 — just two months after she split from Brady whom she had dated for two years. Making things even more dramatic the athlete had just started dating his now-wife supermodel Gisele Bündchen.

Although Brady has been there for Jack from day one that doesn’t mean it was easy for the ex couple. Moynahan has said: “He was there on that day and came in afterwards. He certainly wasn’t holding my hand while I pushed.”

Brady told Howard Stern that “It was very hard for [Bündchen] to think she fell in love with this guy and now this guy’s ex-girlfriend’s pregnant. And it was very challenging for my son’s mom because she didn’t envision that either.”

As for Bündchen in 2015 she told “CBS This Morning”: “I felt like I didn’t know what to do. It was one of those moments where like do I run away? Now eight years later I couldn’t have asked for a sweeter bonus child.”

She also got an unexpected bonus relationship out of the deal. “Gisele and Bridget now actually talk as much as Tom and Bridget if not more” said a friend who knows the family.

“Tom and I made a decision to raise a child together and we both found partners that not only supported us in raising that child but also loved our child as if he was their own” Moynahan told People. “I don’t think you can ask for more than that. My son is surrounded by love.”

Brady married Bündchen in 2009 and they went on to have son Benjamin now 11 and daughter Vivian 8 who are very close to their half-brother. Moynahan wed investment banker Andrew Frankel in 2015 (Brady and Bündchen were not in attendance) and the couple split their time between Tribeca and Shelter Island.

“I’m glad she got her happy ending with Andrew. I’ve spent time with them — he’s not part of the ‘scene’ he’s not a celebrity he’s super down to earth. They’re a sweet couple” a Moynahan friend told The Post.

There were no formal court proceedings after Jack’s birth but any custody and financial support agreements that Brady and Moynahan have were done “privately and respectfully.”

With an estimated $200 million fortune Brady has more than enough for his son’s upbringing. As Page Six reported the athlete and supermodel recently splashed out more than $17 million for a property on Miami’s private Indian Creek Island — nicknamed “Billionaire’s Bunker.”

Brady and Bündchen reportedly plan to build something that meets their dream of sustainable living and he has already been spotted visiting the property by boat with his architect.

“They like things just so every toilet has to be perfect everything has to be sustainable and organic” a friend said. “Sustainability is Gisele’s passion.”

Sources said the two are searching for a new home in Los Angeles and they still have a place in Tribeca — to be close to Jack.

In 2014 Moynahan splashed out $4.6 million on a loft in Tribeca. Jack attends the Upper East Side private school Saint David’s where The Post reported in 2018 Brady was auctioned for lunch. Pre-COVID he was seen playing football with Jack and pals in the schoolyard.

Gisele and Bridget… talk as much as Tom and Bridget if not more. Friend who knows the Brady family

Sources who know Brady say he’s also not a fan of socializing with celebrities. One NY socialite recalled how Patriots owner Bob Kraft “brought Tom to a very smart dinner in the city a few years ago where Elton John was performing and he looked super awkward.”

He’s more comfortable at home where Bündchen is said to rule the roost.

Brady has said that his wife once wrote him a “heartfelt letter” when she felt dissatisfied in the marriage telling Howard Stern: “She felt like I would play football all season and she would take care of the house. And all the sudden when the season would end I would be like ‘Great let me get into all my other business activities. Let me get into my football training.

“And she’s sitting there going ‘Well when are you going to do things for the house? When are you going to take the kids to school and do that?’ … I had to like check myself. Because she’s like ‘I have goals and dreams too.’”

So do their kids. While Jack loves sports younger son Ben loves art and films friends say.

“They’re going to be their own selves not who you want them to be” Brady told Men’s Health. “… [Jack] wants to try hard and he never wants to disappoint his dad. That was me. I’d wake up early on weekends to do stuff with my dad. That’s why I didn’t party a lot.”

Preparing for retirement Brady co-founded his own company TB12 in 2013 with his trainer Alex Guerrero with two performance facilities in Boston and one in Tampa and a best-selling nutrition and fitness book “The TB12 Method.” He’s now developing it into a full-blown health and wellness brand. The pair have plans to open gyms across the country The Post is told but those were delayed because of the pandemic.

On Feb. 7 the Buccaneers will play the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl 2021 at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa Bay Fla. — the Bucs’ first time in the championship since 2002. Whether the Brady bunch will be on hand remains to be seen amid the pandemic. Normally the family would be there.

“There were obviously challenges when Gisele had just met Tom but Jack made their family blended and it’s about family and nothing else matters they make it work because of their love for Jack and the kids” said the source who knows the family. “They’re a true modern blended family.”"

While your graphics card is usually the biggest considering when it comes to gaming performance however we also wanted to look at some of the best CPUs for gaming to see just how much performance you lose — or gain! — by running it with something other than the Core i9-9900K we use in our current GPU testbed.

For this article we've pulled out several of the latest AMD and Intel processors: Core i9-10900K Core i9-9900K Core i3-10100 Ryzen 5 3600 and Ryzen 9 3900X. Then just for good measure we've gone old school and dug up an 'ancient' Core i7-4770K Haswell chip. This is the oldest CPU I've currently got hanging around and it should help answer the question of just how much CPU you need to make good use of the RTX 3080.

We'll be testing at 1080p 1440 and 4K at both medium and ultra presets. We said in the RTX 3080 review that it's a card primarily designed for 4K gaming and that it starts to hit CPU bottlenecks at 1440p. That applies even more at 1080p with medium settings. Generally speaking you don't buy a top-shelf GPU to play games at 1080p though there are esports pros that do just that while using a 240Hz or even 360Hz monitor. Most games will struggle to hit 240 fps; however some even have fps caps of around 200 fps. But we're doing this for science!

Because we're using multiple platforms and were under time constraints not every PC used identical hardware. In the case of the old Haswell PC it couldn't use most of the modern hardware we install in other testbeds — the sole LGA1150 motherboard I have doesn't have an M.2 slot and of course it requires DDR3 memory. I also only have a single kit of DDR3-1600 CL9-9-9 memory which is fine but certainly not the best possible RAM for such a PC. Cases power supplies SSD and other items also differ though most of these aren't critical as far as gaming performance is concerned.

The DDR4-capable PCs were all tested with the same DDR4-3600 CL16 memory kit while our standard GPU benchmarks use DDR4-3200 CL16 memory. We've included both scores for the 9900K as yet another point of reference. Memory speed matters a bit depending on the game though it doesn't make a huge difference overall. In fact at higher settings the 'slower' DDR4-3200 kit actually came out slightly ahead probably thanks to slightly better subtimings. Here are the full testbed specs:

All of the systems are running at stock settings but with XMP memory profiles activated. However the old Z97 board applies an all-core clock of 4.3GHz even at stock settings. It's a bit of a quirky motherboard and the BIOS was finicky enough that I just left it alone. Basically even though it says 4770K treat these results as being representative of a stock-clocked Core i7-4790K. If you actually have a stock clocked 4770K or something like an older i7-2600K your performance will be even lower than what we're showing here.

We're going to start out with 1080p testing which is where the choice of CPU is going to make the biggest difference. None of the games in our test suite are esports titles where extreme fps matters though we do have at least one game that can break into the >360 fps range (Strange Brigade). We've long maintained that there are greatly diminishing returns going beyond 144Hz or even 120Hz displays and a big part of that is the fact that many games simply don't scale to the higher framerates necessary to make the most of higher refresh rates. Okay let's hit the charts:

If you were thinking of pairing the new king of the GPUs with a Core i7-4770K (overclocked) from mid-2013 or maybe even a 3770K or 2600K the worst-case results at 1080p should at least give you pause. There are plenty of situations where your maximum performance is nearly cut in half. With the RTX 3080 the Core i9-10900K is 70% faster at 1080p medium though the gap drops to 47% at 1080p ultra.

Even stepping up to a new Core i3-10100 provides a pretty substantial boost to performance — some of that is from the newer Comet Lake architecture but a lot of the benefit likely comes from the faster memory. The i3-10100 ends up about 25% faster overall compared to the overclocked i7-4770K.

At the other end of the spectrum the move from Core i9-9900K to Core i9-10900K hardly matters at all. At 1080p medium the 10900K is 4% faster across our test suite. That's not a lot and it's not really too surprising. Very few games will leverage more than eight cores so the majority of the improvement comes from the slightly higher clocks on the 10900K. At 1080p ultra the two chips are basically tied. Some of this almost certainly comes down to differences in motherboard firmware however. Even though both testbeds use MSI MEG Ace motherboards (Z390 and Z490) they're not the same. Final Fantasy XIV performs quite a bit worse with the Z490 setup while everything else sees small to modest gains.

What about AMD's CPUs? First let's note that the Ryzen 9 3900X only leads the Ryzen 5 3600 by a scant 7% at medium and 4% at ultra. Several games show nearly a 10% lead while others are effectively tied. That means comparisons between Intel and AMD don't change substantially when moving to a different AMD processor — the Zen 2 chips will all be within 10% of each other. And as we'll see momentarily the AMD CPUs really scrunch together at higher resolutions.

For AMD vs. Intel the Core i9-10900K unsurprisingly comes out on top by a noticeable 18% at 1080p medium. Four of the games we tested give Intel more than a 20% lead with Final Fantasy being the only result that's in the single percentage points. Again we don't expect most gamers would ever pair the RTX 3080 with 1080p medium settings but this is the worst-case scenario for CPU scaling. Shifting up to 1080p ultra Intel's lead drops to just 8%. Far Cry 5 and Shadow of the Tomb Raider still favor Intel by over 20% Metro Exodus shows a 15% lead and everything else is below 10%.

Finally while we didn't do a full suite of testing with ray tracing and DLSS effects it's important to remember that the more demanding a game becomes on your GPU — and ray tracing is definitely demanding — the less your CPU matters. Many games will still need DLSS in performance mode to stay above 60 fps with all the ray tracing effects enabled.

The jump to 1440p represents 78% more pixels but performance only drops by 15% on average at medium settings and 20% at ultra settings. In other words 1080 was very much running into CPU bottlenecks and shifting to a higher resolution doesn't hurt performance all that much even with the fastest CPUs. And if you're using a slower CPU in some cases the change in performance is negligible.

Take the i7-4770K for example. The 1440p medium results are only 3% lower than 1080p medium and the 1440p ultra results are 6% lower than 1080p ultra. If you plan on buying an RTX 3080 and running at 1440p ultra with an older generation CPU you'll lose some performance but not that much. Well maybe. It's worth noting that the i9-9900K with a 2080 Super is faster overall at 1440p medium and below compared to the i7-4770K with a 3080 but the 4770K does at least get a small boost to performance. Or with a 2080 Ti the 9900K even wins at 1440p ultra.

Take just one step up the CPU ladder like moving to a Ryzen 5 3600 or even a Core i3-10100 (which should be about the same level of performance as a Core i7-6700K) and there's at least some benefit to buying an RTX 3080. Still if you're running less than a 6-core CPU we'd definitely recommend upgrading your CPU and perhaps even the rest of your PC before taking the RTX 3080 plunge at 1440p.

As usual 4K is the great CPU equalizer. The demands on the GPU are so high that even a seven-year-old Core i7-4770K now only trails the Core i9-10900K by 8% at 4K ultra. It's still a noticeable 13% behind at 4K medium but hopefully you get the point we're trying to make: The RTX 3080 is very much a graphics card designed to tackle high-resolution gaming. 4K ultra at 60 fps or more is now totally possible and you can do it with a Core i7-4770K Ryzen 5 3600 or go all the way and pair it with a Core i9-10900K or Ryzen 9 3900X.

The gap between current AMD and Intel CPUs at 4K is basically nonexistent. In fact minor differences in board design firmware or just 1% variability in benchmark runs all become factors. The 9900K for example now comes out 'ahead' of the 10900K at 4K medium and the gap is even larger at 4K ultra. That shouldn't happen except it frequently does when you're looking at different motherboards - even with the exact same memory. Maybe the differences in SSD play a role as well.

The point isn't that the 9900K is the fastest CPU at 4K ultra by 1%. The real point is that the difference between the fastest and slowest CPU we tested is only 8% — and if we drop the 4770K the gap shrinks to just 3.5%.

Note that minimum (99th percentile) framerates do show a larger difference. The spread on minimum fps is 19% and still 8.5% if we ignore the 4770K. Also while we don't have exact numbers some of the games definitely take noticeably longer to load on the slower CPUs. Not minutes longer but probably 5-10 seconds more.

In short it's not that the CPU doesn't matter at all at 4K but it doesn't matter very much if all you're doing is playing a game. Of course you might be doing other tasks as well like streaming and encoding your gameplay listening to music chatting on Discord etc. We've isolated gaming performance here as much as possible with a 'clean' OS and testing environment. If you're running any background tasks particularly heavier tasks like streaming having a faster CPU becomes much more important.

GeForce RTX 3080 CPU Scaling: The Bottom Line

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

We fully expected the launch of the GeForce RTX 3080 to push the bottleneck for gaming PCs very much onto the CPU particularly at lower settings and resolutions. That does happen to some extent but not as much as we anticipated. There are other factors to consider as well like the type of games you play. We didn't include testing of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 here for example but that game is currently very much CPU (and API) limited even at ultra settings. Ray tracing effects can also make even 1080p performance far more GPU dependent.

If you're thinking about purchasing the RTX 3080 we still maintain that having a good CPU is important meaning at least a six-core Intel or AMD Ryzen processor. Of course it's all relative as well. Maybe you're looking to upgrade your entire PC in the coming months but you want to wait for Ryzen 5000 to launch. Or maybe you just can't afford to upgrade everything at once. Depending on your current graphics card making the jump to the 3080 might be warranted even on an older PC especially if it's only going to be a temporary solution. How you want to upgrade is a personal decision and it's entirely possible to stuff the RTX 3080 into an old 2nd Gen Core or AMD FX build if you want. We wouldn't recommend doing that but it's possible.

While the biggest differences in performance occurred at lower resolutions and settings it's also important to look at the bigger picture. The Core i9-9900K and 10900K might 'only' be 10% faster than a slower CPU but that's almost a whole step in GPU performance. RTX 2080 Ti was 15-20% faster than the RTX 2080 Super but it cost 70% more. If you're running an older GPU with an older CPU and you're planning to upgrade your graphics card it's probably a good idea to wait and see what the GeForce RTX 3070 brings to the table as well as AMD's Big Navi . You might not miss out on much in terms of performance while saving several hundred dollars depending on the rest of your PC components.

As always the sage advice for upgrades is to only make the jump when your current PC doesn't do what you want it to do. If you're pining for 4K ultra at 60 fps or looking forward to games with even more ray tracing effects the GeForce RTX 3080 is a big jump in generational performance. It's clearly faster than the previous king of the hill (the RTX 2080 Ti or even the Titan RTX) at a substantially lower price. Just don't expect to make full use of the 3080 if you pair it up with an old processor.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhcHRvcG1hZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hLWJlZ2lubmVycy1ndWlkZS10by1udmlkaWEtZ2Vmb3JjZS1ydHgtMzAtc2VyaWVzLWdwdXMtZm9yLWxhcHRvcHPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nvidia GeForce RTX 30 series mobile GPUs: A beginner's guide,"During CES 2021 Nvidia made the huge (yet expected) announcement of the next generation of gaming laptop hardware in the form of GeForce RTX 30 series laptop GPUs. Good news they're frickin' sweet! Bad news Nvidia has made it more difficult than ever to figure out which one is best suited for you.



From eliminating Max-Q labeling making it harder for the average laptop consumer to figure out which device has a handicapped GPU to RTX 3070s having higher base clock speeds than RTX 3080s my head hurts. Whatever happened to 80 is better than 70? Take me back to the simple days.

There are quite a few different aspects at play as some of Nvidia's 30 series GPUs are better suited for software engineers or display more realistic graphics while others boost performance for that smooth frame rate in gaming. It may be a tad trickier to figure out especially as the RTX 30 series don't exactly say what they do on the tin anymore but the main thing to take away from this is Nvidia's new line of GPUs are pretty much all killer.



Thankfully we got our hands on laptops that came with Nvidia 30-Series GPUs including the recently reviewed the Asus TUF Dash F15 and Gigabyte Aero 15 with RTX 3070 the Aorus 15G with RTX 3070 Max-Q and the Alienware m17 R4 with an RTX 3080. This gave us a better idea of how well each GPU performs.



Think of this as my dummy's guide to understanding Nvidia's RTX 30 series GPUs so you can get a better idea of which graphics card is better suited for your next laptop purchase. There's plenty more info to digest and you can find out more on what you need to know about Nvidia’s RTX 30-Series GPUs in our deep dive.

The Nvidia RTX 3060 is still essentially your entry-level graphics card but still had the ability to out-perform an RTX 3080 in terms of boosted clock speeds (GHz) that is. Spec-wise the RTX 3060 GPU has 3840 Nvidia CUDA cores (Nvidia's parallel computing platform that hits CPU cores out of the park) 1283 - 1703MHz boosted clock range and a GPU subsystem power (W) of 60 - 115.



If this looks like gibberish (this is a dummy's guide after all) basically the more CUDA Cores in a GPU the faster it can complete tasks related to graphics. In turn higher CUDA core count more realistic graphics.



As for Nvidia's boosted clock speeds generally this is all about performance meaning smoother functionality when there's a lot of tasks happening especially in games.



GPU subsystem power? This is where things get tricky. This could also be viewed as Total Graphics Power (TGP). As an example: a 115 W RTX 3060 could outperform an 80 W RTX 3080 depending on the given workload.



Labeling a graphics card with Max-Q usually distinguished which end of the range a laptop's GPU would offer but now that Nvidia or the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) don't mention if an RTX GPU is a Max-Q variant in a laptop it's harder to see how well the GPU will actually perform. This is why you should definitely read our laptop reviews before making a definite purchase.



Now that's out of the way the RTX 3060 is definitely for those looking for a boost in performance rather than graphics making it a fantastic mid-range gaming laptop. Its potential boosted clock speeds and high wattage means frame rates will be smooth.

Nvidia RTX 3070: What you need to know

(Image credit: Future)

The RTX 3070 GPUs will most likely be the most popular pick for gaming laptop enthusiasts and will most likely be used more by OEMs. Its specs include 5120 CUDA Cores 1290 - 1620MHz boost clock speeds and 80 - 125W.



The Gigabyte Aero 15 and Asus TUF Dash F15 were both put to the test in gaming. When the Aero 15 ran Assassin’s Creed Odyssey (1080p Very High) it delivered 65 frames per second which surpassed the average mainstream gaming laptop (61 fps) and the TUF Dash F15’s (51 fps).



On the Grand Theft Auto V benchmark (1080p Very High) the Aero 15 hit 96 fps cruising past the average premium gaming laptop (87 fps) and the Asus TUF Dash F15 (84 fps).



We also ran the gaming benchmarks in 4K. On the Assassin’s Creed Odyssey and Valhalla tests the Aero 15 reached 35 fps and 29 fps respectively. These are about half the frame rates than the 1080p setting.



The RTX 3070 is definitely a powerhouse and you'll find that the 3070 has a higher base clock speed and base subsystem power than the RTX 3080 and even RTX 3090 which is a little backward. Being used on higher-end mid-range laptops even means it will generally be cheaper than laptops with an RTX 3080.

Nvidia RTX 3080: What you need to know

(Image credit: Future)

The RTX 3080 boasts 6144 CUDA cores 1245 - 1710MHz boost clock speeds and 50 - 150+W. This could potentially be disappointing to those who paid extra for an RTX 3080 and don't hit the higher-end clock speeds or wattage especially if an RTX 3070 or even 3060 GPU laptop out-performs it. That said it certainly has a higher potential for performance and will clearly display higher graphical details.



In our review of the Alienware m17 R4 the RTX 3080 fully utilized the laptop's 360Hz refresh rate. Along with its 16GB of VRAM we ran the Assassin’s Creed Odyssey benchmark and the m17 R4 reached 78 fps sailing past the 60-fps premium gaming laptop average. Compared to the Aorus 17G which also has an RTX 3080 GPU it delivered 65 fps.



During the Grand Theft Auto V test the m17 R4 obtained 120 fps crushing the 89 fps average and the Aorus 17G 92 fps.



If anything this clearly shows the differing power of an RTX 3080 GPU. While both laptop GPUs displayed impressive frame rates the m17 R4 blew the Aorus 17G out of the park. The moral lesson of the day: read reviews before making that purchase.



Outlook

Nvidia's RTX 30-series has thrown a spanner in the works in terms of how powerful a laptop can be. No longer is it just the simplicity of 70 being better than 60 and so forth as each 30-series GPU distinctly offers different graphics and performance potential.

No let's rephrase that: like a lot of power? Then the MSI GeForce RTX 3090 Suprim X 24G could be the next GPU for you. As a top-of-the-heap power-hungry productivity dynamo the RTX 3090 Suprim soars knocking out every productivity benchmark we could throw its way while posting all-time records in gaming tests. But all that power comes at a price ($1799 MSRP to be exact) and its performance results alone don't justify a 150% increase over the perfectly capable gaming beast that is the Editors' Choice-winning RTX 3080 Founders Edition ($699 if you can find one). That said for content creators or elite gamers unbound by mortal budgets you won't find a more powerful option on the market for the price. This overclocked mega-card does more than enough to justify its place at the top of the top of the stack.

Specs Compared: MSI GeForce RTX 3090 Suprim X 24G vs. the World

Cards in the RTX 3090 line fall under the same category that used to be occupied by Nvidia's Titan GPUs in the RTX 20 Series and the Titan X before that during the launch of 10 Series. These graphics cards while perfectly capable of gaming are priced and configured in a way that's more aptly suited to content-creation professionals than your average gamer.

In the past cards in this tier of the market would be stuffed with a good deal more VRAM than anything else offered in midrange or even most ""high-end"" releases (save for unicorns like the $799 AMD Radeon VII with its 24GB of HBM2 memory) and things are no different this time around. While the RTX 3080 Founders Edition comes with an impressive 10GB of GDDR6X RAM the RTX 3090 ups that to a whopping 24GB the same amount as its spiritual predecessor the $2499 Nvidia Titan RTX.

You'll notice the lack of a ""GeForce"" badge there. The re-introduction of high-VRAM variants of Nvidia's mainstream graphics lineup including advertising the RTX 3090 as the ""world's first 8K gaming card"" blurs the line a bit between what gamers and content creators can spend on their next graphics card if they want the top dog.

And that spend is not small. The GeForce RTX 2080 Ti set a precedent for GPU pricing at $1199 for the Founders Edition and with the RTX 3090 Founders Edition inching up the goalpost to $1399 (while still using the same GA102 die found in the $699 RTX 3080 Founders Edition) you might think that Nvidia is reconfiguring expectations for what kind of cash gamers need to fork over for absolute top frame rates in their favorite titles. That said gamers aren't really the primary target here despite this card's big-time gamer look. (Though Nvidia and MSI would surely be happy to sell gamers cards of this caliber too.)

Like the Titan RTX the $1799 MSI GeForce RTX 3090 Suprim X 24G finds itself slotting in at the highest end of what most gamers would consider strictly for gaming while still falling well below Nvidia's enterprise-facing Quadro line of content-creation cards ($5500 for the Quadro RTX 8000) which are more often found in a server rack than an RGB-packed gaming tower.

That said according to a comparison of 163 results from the website UserBenchmark (grain of salt here they are ""user submitted"" after all) the RTX 3090 regularly outpaces the latest and greatest Quadro RTX 8000 in both performance and overall value by a strong margin. (Various benchmark results submitted by users include gaming-focused runs like MRender which tests a GPUs ability to use render target arrays and geometry shaders in Direct3D as well as NBody a particle physics simulation that tests how quickly the card can calculate gravity values between thousands of individual points in space.)

Last December Nvidia quietly rolled out its $4650 A6000 line of GPUs part of a stack that could be called ""Quadro"" by any other name. The A6000 is focused on enterprise buyers exclusively and with stock situations being what they are for the RTX 30 Series it's likely that getting your hands on these workhorses would be even harder than winning a Newegg component lottery.

So for those content creators in between we have cards like the massive 13.2-inch triple-fan triple-slot-width MSI GeForce 3090 Suprim X 24G to overstuff the gap. This card shows off some of MSI's best aesthetic choices in a long time in my opinion with an RGB strip that stretches from one end of the card to another. The strip also illuminates the space behind a see-through MSI logo cut through the metal of the back of the card. All the RGB lighting and features of the RTX 3090 Suprim can be controlled through MSI's Dragon Center Software which contains myriad ways to customize your Suprim to fit your RGB preferences (if you have such urges at all of course).

On the top of the card I found an NVLink connector a rare find in the RTX 30 Series these days. Nvidia hasn't completely scrapped the idea of dual-card solutions just yet and sensibly the company has left the technology as an option only in the RTX 3090 class of cards. Though there are a few games out there that know how to take advantage of two graphics cards linked up through either NVLink or the aging SLI standard the best usage case for NVLink these days is in productivity and content-creation tasks which is exactly what the RTX 3090 was designed for. We didn't have another identical RTX 3090 on hand to test the feature though. RTX 3090s like every other high-end graphics card in the world right now aren't easy to come by.

To handle the power requirements of the ""Ampere""-based GA102 die the MSI RTX 3090 Suprim X 24G sucks down a staggering 420 watts of power and like the MSI GeForce RTX 3080 Gaming X Trio 10G requires three eight-pin connectors to boot up. MSI doesn't sell an adapter with this card the same way Nvidia has packaged 12-pin converters with its RTX 3090 Founders Edition so make sure you have a PSU that can support this card as well as all the necessary cables before you hit the buy button.

The back of the card contains your usual smattering of port options seen in the RTX 30 Series including three DisplayPort 1.4b slots one HDMI 2.1 port and...well no VirtualLink connections to be seen.

Let's Get Testing! How Supreme Is the 'Suprim'?

PC Labs ran the MSI GeForce RTX 3090 Suprim X 24G through a series of DirectX 11- and 12-based synthetic and real-world benchmarks. Our PC Labs test rig is Intel-based and employs a PCI Express 3.0 not 4.0 motherboard. It's equipped with an Intel Core i9-10900K processor 16GB of G.Skill DDR4 memory a solid-state boot drive and an Asus ROG Maximus XII Hero (Wi-Fi) motherboard. All cards below were tested on this rig. Given our tests with the Core i9-10900K and recent Ryzen 9 CPUs this rig is the best reasonable configuration of the moment in 2021 to cut the CPU out of the equation for frame rates. (Read more about how we test graphics cards.)

For our testing we focused some of the effort on the esports aspect of the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 with games like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) and Rainbow Six: Siege. We also ran the card through the rest of our standard benchmark regimen which tests a card's abilities to handle AAA games at the highest possible quality settings as well as how it rides during synthetic benchmarks that stress the card in a variety of ways.

Also remember that almost every test we run (aside from the esports titles) is done at the highest possible quality preset or settings. If you have a higher-hertz gaming monitor and you're worried your card might not make the frame-rate grade it could still be possible with the right card and a combination of lower settings. Not only that but many of these titles (including Death Stranding Shadow of the Tomb Raider and F1 2020) have both DLSS and FidelityFX CAS with Upscaling integrated directly into the game. This can mean boosts of up to 40 percent more performance on top depending on the setting and the card you're playing with.

And so onward to our test results. Note: If you want to narrow down our results below to a specific resolution (say the resolution of the monitor you plan to game on) click the other two resolution dots in the chart legends below to suppress them and see a single set of results. Our list of AAA titles includes a mix of recent AAA titles like Red Dead Redemption 2 and F1 2020 as well as some older-but-still-reliable pillars of the benchmarker's toolkit like Shadow of the Tomb Raider and Far Cry 5.

Testing Results: Synthetic Benchmarks

Synthetic benchmarks can be good predictors of real-world gaming performance. UL's circa-2013 Fire Strike Ultra is still a go-to as an approximation of the load levied by mainstream 4K gaming. We're looking only at the test's Graphics Subscore not the Overall Score to isolate the card performance. Meanwhile we also ran 3DMark's Time Spy Extreme test which is a good test of how well a card will do specifically in DirectX 12 games at 4K resolution. Finally there's Port Royal which is strictly a test for RTX cards right now measuring how well they handle ray-tracing tasks. (Thus why blank results for the AMD cards on that one.) Also here are a handful of GPU-acceleration tests (Furmark V-Ray LuxMark); more details on those at the ""how we test"" link.

If there's anywhere the MSI RTX 3090 Suprim X 24G is going to make the case for its high cost it's here. The 24GB of onboard VRAM sends the RTX 3090 to new heights in these tests setting records wherever it goes though perhaps not by the kinds of margins that you might have been expecting given the price.

Admittedly our testing regimen is more geared toward synthetic gaming tests. However both the LuxMark and V-Ray results paint a picture of a card with a whole lot of power to handle tasks like pathing out light rays and or rendering in complete 3D scenes with reflective surfaces.

These are limited benchmarks but they still tell the story that any content professionals who work in fields like virtual effects 3D modelling design or any other creative career that requires a lot of GPU horsepower should be lining up around the block to get their hands on an RTX 3090.

Testing Results: Recent AAA Games

Now on to the real-world game stuff. The following benchmarks are games that you can play. We typically used in each case (for the AAA games) the highest in-game preset and if available DirectX 12. The multiplayer-focused and esports titles (such as CS:GO and Rainbow Six) were set slightly below top detail settings to maximize frame rates.

During its marketing blitz Nvidia chose to focus on the RTX 3090 as the ""world's first 8K gaming card"" though this is disputable depending on a huge variety of factors that won't fit in the small print. (Cards that came before the RTX 3090 can run games and applications at 8K...it's just a matter of how well.)

While we didn't run any games at 8K for this set of benchmarks the results show that just getting to 60fps in 4K isn't always possible for the RTX 3090 let alone 8K. That said what we did see out of the RTX 3090 Suprim impressed us nonetheless.

As a top-floor-with-a-view kind of card the gaming performance of the MSI GeForce RTX 3090 Suprim outpaces any other GPU we've tested to date and not always by a small margin. In some of the titles we tested like Red Dead Redemption 2 the RTX 3090 was more than 20% faster than the RTX 3080 Founders Edition in 1440p though that gain dipped to just 12% in 4K. We can't say how much extra juice MSI has imparted into its RTX 3090 over other models just yet since Founders Edition RTX 3090 cards were in short supply from Nvidia during the RTX 30 Series launch and PCMag didn't get the opportunity to test one.

That said no matter what numbers the 3090 FE puts up it won't take anything away from the victory of the RTX 3090 Suprim. The only thing that would? A reminder of the Suprim's $1799 price. When compared with the card it usurped (the $759 MSI GeForce RTX 3080 Gaming X Trio 10G) the wins in gaming are immediately brought back into perspective.

Testing Results: Multiplayer Games

Though most of PC Labs' game tests are maxed out in graphical fidelity to push the cards to their limit multiplayer gaming is all about maintaining the best balance between graphical fidelity and frame rate. With that in mind we've kept CS:GO Rainbow Six: Siege and Final Fantasy XIV tuned to the best combination of necessary improvements in settings (higher anti-aliasing and lower shadows for example) while still trying to keep frame rates for 1080p games above 144fps.

Why 144fps? That's a coveted target for highly competitive esports gamers who have high-refresh-rate 120Hz or 144Hz (or faster) monitors. For more casual players with ordinary 60Hz monitors a solid 80fps or 90fps at your target resolution with some overhead to account for dips under 60fps is fine.

If the RTX 3080 Founders Edition was already completely overkill for multiplayer games like CS:GO or Rainbow Six the RTX 3090 is well past the point of just showing off.

The RTX 3090 blasts out all the games we could throw its way though not by a margin anywhere near the difference in price that would make it a good pick for multiplayer gamers over the venerable RTX 3080 Founders Edition or even the RTX 3070 Founders Edition which we at PC Labs consider the sweet spot for high-refresh 1440p gaming these days.

Cards based on the GA102 die are already pushing these engines to their limits and a 13% gain in Rainbow Six frames (especially at 400fps-plus faster than even the fastest monitors) isn't going to make or break getting the critical headshot in your next round. Plus it definitely isn't worth the nearly 140% difference in price between the RTX 3090 Suprim and MSI's RTX 3080 Gaming X Trio 10G. Unless you're an esports star making millions of bucks a lesser RTX card will do for these kinds of games.

Testing Results: How About Some Legacy AAA Titles?

We also ran some quick tests on some oldies-but-goodies that still offer the AAA gaming experience. These legacy tests include runs of Hitman: Absolution Tomb Raider (2013) and Bioshock: Infinite the last being a game that has no business still being as well optimized as it is here in 2020.

Legacy titles like multiplayer games are more of a flex than anything else for cards at the level of the RTX 3090...but that doesn't mean we still don't want to see it roll its sleeves up a little.

Depending on the game there were either clear ceilings where neither the RTX 3080 nor the RTX 3090 could go much further and others like Bioshock: Infinite which will take every ounce of power you throw its way and translate it into record after record. Again the RTX 3090 is way over the limit for what you should be paying if all you plan to do is play games that came out several years ago. But it's still nice to know that if you wanted to go that hard in the paint the option is there.

Overclocking and Thermals: Too Close to the Sun?

We ran a 10-minute stress test in 3DMark Port Royal on the MSI Geforce RTX 3090 Suprim X 24G and the card peaked at a temperature of 81 degrees C. This makes the MSI Geforce RTX 3090 Suprim X 24G the hottest RTX 30 Series card we've tested thus far though that result is expected given the added power hiding inside.

Though we've been able to pit the RTX 3080 Founders Edition against several third-party RTX 3080 cards since they originally launched in November right now we have no point of comparison on heat or noise for the RTX 3090 Suprim. That said for such an intimidating card on the outside once we had it installed in the rig it barely made a peep even during the most intense scenarios.

When it came time to overclock the card using EVGA's Precision X1 utility I achieved a small but stable boost of 110MHz on the boost clock and 150MHz on the memory clock. However this roughly 6% gain in clock speed didn't translate to more than 1% gains in Far Cry 5 or Rainbow Six: Siege. LuxMark runs returned similarly slim gains so the ceiling applied equally whether we tried to run gaming or content-creation benchmarks. This card was pretty well pushed to the max straight from the box.

The Best You Can Get If You Can Find—and Afford—It

Right now the MSI GeForce RTX 3090 Suprim X 24G is the best card built for the specific job it's meant to handle. And considering that AMD's Radeon VII is nearly two years old at this point (plus outside benchmarks which show the $999 Radeon RX 6900 XT doesn't hold a candle to the RTX 3090 nor should it considering their price differences) the likelihood of it remaining uncontested at this level remains strong.

If you are strictly a gamer and only care about playing games: Please don't buy an RTX 3090 unless you just won the Mega Millions. And we mean that in the ""for the greater good"" sense. Stock of every Nvidia card is strung as thin as it can go as of this writing (January 2021) and that situation only looks to be getting more dire as to when Nvidia claims the supply will keep pace with demand.

Content creators designers virtual effects artists and any other of the dozens of creative and industrial careers that can put the brawn of the RTX 3090 to use at its best work deserve to have their card too. So at least until the stock levels catch up we can't in good conscience recommend this card strictly as an option for gamers who want 2.9% more frames than an RTX 3080 in Assassin's Creed: Odyssey at 4K resolution.

But nor would we do so on the basis of price either. At $1799 the MSI GeForce RTX 3090 Suprim was only around 15% faster on average than the RTX 3080 Founders Edition in 4K and 1440p and those are the only two resolutions you should really be playing in with this kind of card. Considering that at retail the RTX 3080 Founders Edition goes for just $699 (not factoring in scalping prices which could increase even further after tariffs) that's just over a 157% increase in cost. This is a disproportionate gulf for a moderate—and perhaps even invisible depending on your gaming monitor—boost in gaming performance.

Are you the progeny of an oil baron with $1799 burning a hole in your pocket? Then hey go for it: The MSI RTX 3090 Suprim X 24G is the fastest graphics card we've ever tested for gaming full stop. But if you're like the rest of us an RTX 3080 Founders Edition will handle the job almost as well for less than half the cost (at retail). We don't know how either cards will be affected by the incoming tariffs nor the continuing stock situation but all we can say is this: Don't buy an RTX 3090 for gaming in desperation just because it's there. Leave that stock for the people who need it to create and start mashing that F5 button on the page for any number of other RTX 3080 models instead.

For those creators and builders though your top card just got a whole lot more powerful...and yes it games like a city-stomping monster to boot."

Kelly Mi Li and Andrew Gray's relationship dynamic takes center stage in season 1 of Netflix's Bling Empire. But as Kelly revealed early on in the lavish reality show she was once married before meeting the Power Rangers Megaforce star.

""In my twenties I was married to a Chinese guy and we lived a privileged outrageous lifestyle” Kelly 35 explained during the show’s premiere episode. “You know seven cars four houses. I think at the time we were spending like 400000 a month on our black [American Express card] until one day the government showed up and took everything from us and my ex-husband was arrested.""

Who is Kelly Mi Li's ex-husband and what happened to him?

As hinted at in Bling Empire Kelly was once married to Lin Miao a founder and CEO of a texting company who was arrested for ""running one of the largest cyber scams in American history"" roughly 10 years ago. According to the Federal Trade Commission's website and the Los Angeles Business Journal Lin and his co-conspirators conducted a multi-million-dollar scam to charge text message services on consumers' bills without their permission.

The FTC complaint alleged that Lin and his partners used deceptive websites to collect consumers' phone numbers to bill them for the services. Customers were charged a rate of $9.99 per month and the charges were often concealed in a confusing form. When consumers tried to seek refunds some of the promised refunds never came through or customers only received partial refunds. Per the FBI Lin and his co-conspirators' fraud scheme amassed in excess of $50 million which was used to finance their lavish lifestyles.

According to The Sun Lin pled guilty and received supervised released for his cooperation with authorities. Kelly filed for divorce from Lin in November 2014. In May 2015 their divorce was finalized. According to Kelly the couple's assets were frozen and they gave the government roughly $168 million.

""I moved to Los Angeles for two reasons: One is to run away from a boy. Two is to chase a boy"" Kelly explained on the show before opening up about Andrew. "" ... he has a great heart. He’s very honest. [With] a lot of my past relationships trust has always been an issue.""



Recently Kelly confirmed during the Bling Empire: Where Are They Now special that she and Andrew are back together after breaking up briefly in season 1.

The Covid pandemic’s short-term detrimental impact has eroded business values and growth prospects for most sectors across the globe. But what is also true is that there are several sectors where market movements have surprised us.With the gradual opening up of the economy this pandemic has become a potentially transformational event for sectors like real estate construction and some others. Real estate demand has picked up and registration numbers and enquiries are rising and secondary market channels are clearly showing an uptick in the last two or three months.The sector has witnessed positive sentiment among home buyers not only from end-user perspective but also from long-term investors. Similarly the market is looking ahead to better times. Many stocks in the sector have rallied lately which is another sign that investors are anticipating a strong revival. As investors we need to look at some parameters before investing in real estate stocks.The demand-supply gap for quality residential housing favourable demographics rising income levels availability of financing options as well as fiscal benefits available on home loan are some the fundamental factors benefitting the real estate sector Investing in any stock requires careful analysis of financial data to find out the company's true worth. This is generally done by examining the company's profit and loss account balance sheet and cash flow statement along with various financial ratios. Though there are many important financial ratios out there investors only tend to focus on a handful of them. Besides specific ratios hold significance in particular sectors and they tell the growth story better than the others.For real estate stocks investors should focus more on working capital-to-sales considering the high gestation period of projects besides the debt-to-equity ratio operating margins and return on capital employed.Companies with minimal debt-to-equity ratios strong cash flows and no share pledges hold better prospects. The debt-to-equity ratio is a metric used to determine the degree of a company's financial leverage. Undoubtedly this metric reveals the amount of debt and equity a company can utilise to finance its operations. Besides investors should also keep a check on the possible equity dilution as and when large funding is required for timely execution of projects.On the valuation front one should try and do an analysis of price-to-earnings and price-to-sales ratios before investing in a real estate stock. One should also look at the size of the 'land bank'  as that gives an indication of growth visibility in the company's revenues. An investor should also look at the disclosure standards followed by a company and that is a good reflection of its governance standards.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9yYW5keS1jb3V0dXJlLXJlY2FsbHMtYmVpbmctZmx5LTE1MTAyMTg5My5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Randy Couture recalls being 'fly in the ointment' for UFC's Chuck Liddell plans in 2003,"Randy Couture recalls being ‘fly in the ointment’ for UFC’s Chuck Liddell plans in 2003

When the UFC offered Randy Couture an interim light heavyweight title shot in 2003 the writing was on the wall.

Couture already a two-time heavyweight champion by then knew the UFC wasn’t happy about him beating the younger Pedro Rizzo twice in back-to-back fights to defend his title in 2001.

“I don’t think they were too keen on having a 39 40-year-old heavyweight champion” Couture said in a recent episode of “Legend 2 Legend” with Burt Watson. “I don’t think they thought I was very marketable.”

In 2002 Couture lost his title when he was TKO’d by Josh Barnett who subsequently was stripped after testing positive for banned substances. That gave Couture a chance to reclaim his belt six months later in a vacant title fight against Ricco Rodriguez but Couture was submitted in the fifth round.

After that Couture was slated to fight Andrei Arlovski until three weeks before the fight Arlovski broke his hand. So the UFC called Couture with a Plan B.

How about he moves down in weight to fight Chuck Liddell for an interim light heavyweight title?

At that time Liddell was in a heated feud with former friend and then undisputed champion Tito Ortiz. Liddell vs. Ortiz was the biggest fight the UFC could make. The way Couture saw the situation UFC president Dana White and the Fertitta brothers wanted to put Liddell over with interim gold so they could apply pressure on Ortiz to accept a title-unifier with Liddell.

“Obviously I was the fly in the ointment for that whole scenario” Couture said.

No doubt about that as Couture went on to dominate Liddell before finishing him in the third round with some vicious ground-and-pound to become the first fighter in UFC history to win titles in two divisions.

In the video above the UFC Hall of Famer reflects on his victory and how it put him in “a bit of an adversarial situation” with White and the Fertitta brothers.

Zuckerberg ""reached out to talk about the code and the impact on Facebook"" and a constructive discussion followed last week between the social media billionaire Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg and communications minister Paul Fletcher.

""No Mark Zuckerberg didn't convince me to back down if that's what you're asking"" Frydenberg told the Australian Broadcasting Corp without giving further details of the meeting.

A Facebook spokeswoman in Australia said the company's executives regularly meet with government stakeholders on a range of topics.

""We're actively engaging with the Australian government with the goal of landing on a workable framework to support Australia's news ecosystem"" she said.

Australia intends to introduce a law that would force Facebook the world's largest social media platform and internet search giant Google Inc to negotiate payments to media companies whose content drives traffic to their websites. If the parties cannot agree on payments a government-appointed arbitrator will set the fees for them.

Facebook and Google oppose the ""News Media Bargaining Code"" and have mounted public campaigns against it. Google has threatened to withdraw its search engine from Australia while Facebook has warned it would stop Australians sharing news content on its site if the laws go ahead.

At a Senate inquiry into the planned law this month local heads of both companies outlined their opposition to the plans which would be among the toughest in the world in dealing with the financial impact of global internet companies on domestic media which have been hit by shrinking advertising revenue.

""We're told that if we go ahead with this we're going to break the internet"" Frydenberg said on the ABC.

""What I do know is that media businesses should be paid for content.""

As a top-40 finalist in the National Regeneron Science Talent Search Iowa City West senior Dasia Taylor said before her junior year her only other experience participating in a science fair was during early elementary school.

“Well I had an experience. If you count the first-grade science fair” Taylor said. “We had to come up with a project and I chose M&M’s and the probability of which color would be in the bag.”

During her time in high school Taylor has accumulated many achievements including presenting at Harvard to discuss racial equity and becoming involved in numerous committees throughout Iowa City. Most recently Taylor was awarded a $25000 scholarship as a top-40 finalist among 1760 other entrants in Regeneron’s Science Talent Search.

Taylor entered the science scene when her AP Chemistry teacher Carolyn Walling told her class about an opportunity to participate in science fairs across the state.

“Dasia jumped right on the idea. She was super excited about it” Walling said. “Every time I meet with a student that wants to do a science fair I hope they’ll say something I’ll know a lot about so I can be of greater assistance. But Dasia said surgery and I thought ‘How in the world am I going to help her?'”

Walling provided Taylor with different articles to guide her search for a surgery-related project. After reading one of the articles and completing internet research Taylor said she realized what type of project she wanted to pursue.

“In the articles I read so much technology was used to figure out the basic principles of wound healing” Taylor said. “The equity part of me knew that those who are disproportionately dying because of surgical site infections wouldn’t be able to afford sutures with electrical currents.”

Taylor used the information she learned about skin and wound acidity to create surgical sutures that change colors when exposed to a beet indicator revealing a difference in pH levels.

Infected wounds rise to a higher pH which can be identified by the color change produced.

Taylor said she is planning on patenting her project so that she can help people across the world with limited access to medical services.

Walling said leading up to Regeneron’s Science Talent Search Taylor’s research garnered her success in other science competitions.

She won the Junior Science and Humanities Seminar and placed second at the State Science and Technology Fair of Iowa. At the Eastern Iowa Science and Engineering Fair Taylor took home multiple awards and most notably qualified for the International Science Fair sponsored by Regeneron.

After earning a finalist position at the International Science Fair which was later canceled because of COVID-19 Taylor entered her project into the Regeneron Science Talent Search competition.

Since securing a position as a top-40 finalist Taylor is preparing for the competition’s second phase. The top prize is a $250000 scholarship.

After Walling moved into a district position Taylor turned to AP Chemistry Teacher Michelle Wikner to use her lab space and receive additional guidance.

“What she’s trying to do now is make some improvements based on feedback from last year’s competitions” Wikner said. “Dasia has the confidence to take risks. She understands that in order to have a good idea you actually need lots and lots of ideas and she’s not afraid to be bold and put something out there.”

While pouring many hours into her research for the Regeneron Science Talent Search and remaining active in other extracurriculars Taylor said she is realizing the importance of rest.

“I’m learning how to sleep” she said. “I’m learning to take naps when I’m tired and that has never really happened before.”

Taylor said what sustains her most is the ability to change the lives of others.

“Knowing that what I’m doing will not only help me but also helps the community at large is enough to keep me going” she said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMitgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzY2VudGVybWFpbmUuY29tL2FydGljbGUvdGVjaC9zY2llbmNlL2Jhbmdvci1oaWdoLXNjaG9vbC1zZW5pb3ItbmFtZWQtdG9wLTQwLWZpbmFsaXN0cy1pbi1wcmVzdGlnaW91cy1uYXRpb25hbC1zdGVtLWNvbXBldGl0aW9uLzk3LWJmOTUzNzllLWRmNWQtNDEzYi05YmQxLWMyNzk0OGFiMzA3MtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bangor High School senior named top 40 finalists in prestigious national STEM competition,"Out of 1760 entries 16-year-old Vetri Vel moves to the final round of the Regeneron Science Talent Search competition after creating a ""fall detection"" program.

BANGOR Maine — At just 16 Vetri Vel is putting Bangor on the map in terms of STEM studies.

He's competing in the oldest and most prestigious science and math competition in the nation the Regeneron Science Talent Search. Out of 1760 project entries Vel has made it to the top 40.

The 'Talent Search' focuses on identifying the nation's most promising young scientists who are creating ideas that could solve society's most urgent challenges.

Vetri’s project is titled: Real-Time Fall Detection System for the Elderly Using Thermal Imaging and Deep Learning.

""My research was on developing a real-time fall detection system for the elderly and the motivation for this was that I heard many instances of older adults falling and not getting help for hours or days"" says Vel.

How it works is the system monitors your space using a low-resolution thermal camera and a small computer called a Raspberry Pi.

Vetri Vel is the youngest and only Mainer who made it to the top 40 of the @Regeneron @Society4Science nation-wide #STEM competition for high schoolers. He made a ‘Fall Detection System’ for the elderly. Tune in at 6 @newscentermaine to learn more about his top-notch project! pic.twitter.com/91FXJfmMPa — Hannah Yechivi (@hannahyechiviTV) January 31 2021

Vetri is the only Mainer to make it to the top 40 finalists this year and is the youngest in the top 40. This specific competition is just for high school seniors.

Vetri found through CDC stats that each year. 25% of elderly adults fall and in 20% of cases the individual remains stuck on the floor for more than an hour before getting help. His project may lead to fewer hospitalizations for seniors after a fall which is the leading cause of fatalities among the elderly.

""It can send an automated phone call or text message and a text message would be good because then it can also attach the imaging so that you can look at it yourself and decide if you want to drive over and check on them"" says Vel.

Vel hopes to make a difference in elderly lives with his 'Fall Detection' system.

""This system would be especially effective in nursing homes where they tend to be short-staffed and you can't always be checking on the person"" says Vel.

Proud of our @JAX_Education/@mmsa_org Maine State Science Fair alum Vetri Vel who was named a @Society4Science #RegeneronSTS finalist. Congratulations Vel on this prestigious honor! https://t.co/9zmMWkZd5r pic.twitter.com/uGb35nktzT — The Jackson Laboratory (@jacksonlab) January 28 2021

Cary James was the STEM coordinator at Bangor High School for decades. James has retired but continues to mentor Vel specifically on how to present his research project. James says Vel is a role model for other Maine students.

""You've got a kid who did this work at home you don't have to go to a high tech laboratory and have sophisticated equipment you can do it in your house"" adds James.

Bangor High School's Department Chair and STEM coordinator Barabara Stewart says ""He just has so many ideas and is kind of always thinking always creating. That love of learning is really what you can learn from Vetri.""

Vel and the other 39 finalists were each awarded at least $25000 and the top 10 awards range from $40000 to $250000.

According to the Bangor School Department Bangor High School will receive $2000 to use to promote student research in STEM (Science Technology Engineering and Math) fields.

“This year’s finalists represent many of our nation’s most promising young scientists who even during a global pandemic are using their ingenuity resourcefulness and STEM skills to work toward a better future"" said George D. Yancopoulos President and Chief Scientific Officer of Regeneron. ""I can only hope that their STS experience further inspires them to take on and help solve the biggest challenges facing mankind – from climate change to disease and future pandemics.”

The finalists will participate in a virtual competition from March 10-17 2021 where they will undergo a rigorous virtual judging process to compete for more than $1.8 million in awards. They will also have an opportunity to interact with leading scientists and display their projects to the public during a virtual event on March 14. Usually held in person in Washington D.C. the 2021 competition will take place virtually in order to keep the finalists and their families safe during the ongoing pandemic.

Whether he wins or loses this competition won't stop Vetri Vel from using his mind to make a difference.

""I think Vetri is going to be a kid who is really going to contribute at a high level to society in a positive way"" says James.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFya2Fuc2Fzb25saW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvamFuLzMxL2lvd2EtY2l0eS1zdHVkZW50LWhvbm9yZWQtZm9yLXN1dHVyZXMtdGhhdC1ub3RlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Iowa City student honored for sutures that note infections | Arkansas Democrat Gazette,"IOWA CITY Iowa -- Iowa City student Dasia Taylor maintains that she's not a scientist -- even after being nationally honored for creating sutures or stitches that change color when the wound they bind together develops an infection.

Instead Taylor's work stemmed from merging curiosity about the medical field with a passion for equity.

""Even if you don't know what you're doing just go with it"" says Taylor 17 a senior at West High School in Iowa City. ""I stand by the idea that I stumbled into STEM by way of intellectual curiosity. Be curious because that will afford you so many opportunities.""

She's been recognized as one of the top 40 students out of 300 nationally -- and the only from Iowa -- from among 1760 submissions in the Regeneron Science Talent Search. The competition offered through the Society for Science & the Public seeks out independent student research that addresses global issues.

As one of the competition's top 40 finalists Taylor will receive at least $25000 for her efforts. The top 10 who will be announced in March after the finalists undergo a ""rigorous"" virtual judging process will win anywhere from $40000 to $250000.

""Scholars were chosen based on their exceptional research skills commitment to academics innovative thinking and promise as scientists and hail from 198 American and international high schools in 37 states Puerto Rico Chinese Taipei and Singapore"" according to the nonprofit's announcement about this year's competition.

According to the World Health Organization infections following surgery are the most common complications of health care procedures in developing countries. As many as one in five women who have a cesarean section in Africa will develop an infection after the surgery for example.

In her research Taylor came across a new type of stitches that can detect infections which could help prevent dangerous post-surgery infections but would be expensive to implement in places where they're most needed.

For Taylor that issue stood out: She has long been immersed in questions of equity; she began studying restorative justice practices in middle school and now is the co-chair of the Iowa City Community School District's equity committee.

""It was all this fancy technology just to do a couple of basic principles of science and identify basic principles of wound healing. And so I was like 'Okay that's cool and all but the people who actually need it probably can't afford it'.""

So she set out to create an alternative. And that's where the beets come in.

""Here's where the science stuff happens"" Taylor prefaced.

""Natural indicators"" are substances occurring in nature -- like turmeric grape juice cherries red cabbage and of course beets -- that change color when their level of acidity or pH level also changes.

Human skin has natural a pH level of around 5 meaning it's acidic. When wounds develop they lose acidity and transition to a pH range of around 8-10.

""So what I did was I found a natural indicator that changed color within that range"" Taylor said. That's what allows stitches dyed in beet juice to turn purple when the wound becomes infected.

The idea to conduct research in the first place began with West High School teacher Carolyn Walling. She often gauges student interest in independent research and offers to oversee it.

""Usually I don't get too many takers. A couple. And (Taylor) was just so excited when I mentioned it"" Walling said. ""She just had so many ideas and was so excited and she just immediately got to work.""

The research itself took months to complete -- and all of it outside of school. Taylor researched sutures dyed them using beet juice and tested pH levels from late September 2019 up until Valentine's Day 2020.

""Hers was 100% hers and it was unique"" Walling said. ""And it was innovative -- no one's ever thought of that before. Not that we could find anyway. So that's why it was so extraordinary.""

Now a senior Taylor is in the process of applying to law school. The exact type of law she wants to go into she says is still up in the air.

""I'm a firm believer (that) you don't have to be confined to a box and just stay in one subject area. You can bounce around. If you're interested in it go for it.""",,,,,,

Turner has been a sanitation worker with Republic Services for more than 23 years. A lifelong singer Turner said he did a few talent shows when he was young but often found himself too shy to perform in public. But over the last six years he's found a traveling stage -- singing for the people along his Henderson route.

""They treat me like I'm a person not a worker"" Turner said. ""Some of them I have a good relationship with and I love them. They're like family to me.""

Turner said over the last couple months he's unexpectedly ended up in the spotlight when a couple locals decided to share their love for Turner on social media.

""They say when you look for things you can't find it but if you don't want it it comes and grabs you. That's the way God is I guess"" he said.

Turner said the only way he knows how to show his gratitude for the love and support he's received is to keep singing. Turner is humble kind and generous with his talent making Las Vegas a better place along the way. That's why he is our Vegas Stronger Champion.

The company is experiencing a difficult period as after the termination of the Nikola Badger also the collaboration on battery-electric refuse trucks with Republic Services (and potential big order) has come to an end.

We are really not sure whether the heavy-duty hydrogen fuel cell business will take off as most of what we have seen so far are announcements. The FCV car market has hit rock bottom and it might be the same with trucks and buses.

At some point in 2021 Nikola's European branch - related to IVECO - is expected to start the production of an all-electric Nikola Tre semi-truck at the IVECO plant in Ulm Germany. The Alpha prototypes are already being tested in the U.S. We guess that there is a separate fleet in Europe.

Despite the initial positioning as a hydrogen truck company Nikola will start from battery-electric trucks and you know what? It might turn out that at some point in the future they will drop the FCV idea and stick with BEVs.",,,,,,,,,

Despite chronic wage stagnation in Australia certain job sectors – like healthcare trades and government – are currently experiencing salary growth and tech skills soft skills and business know-how will be prized.

COVID-19 has also accelerated the growth of some industries; for example those in aged care the disability sector and mining and infrastructure are seeing notable pay increases.

Tech skills are still #1

Thanks to COVID-19’s acceleration of remote work and the digitisation of the workplace those with digital and technological skills will be in greater demand over the coming years.

“When it comes to salary growth technology jobs are in a stronger position compared to many other positions in the market” Robert Half director Nicole Gorton told Yahoo Finance.

Businesses across all industries are investing more heavily into artificial intelligence and robotics she said.

With the international travel ban still in place hiring managers are struggling to fill specialised IT roles.

“Both these forces are placing upward pressure on tech salaries as companies compete for the right talent to help them prepare for the future of work.”

Nearly 7 in 10 chief information officers surveyed by Robert Half said they were willing to pay more to secure top talent in IT.

“With the trend likely to continue for the next few years we expect roles such as cyber-security specialists DevOps and cloud engineers as well as front end software developers to show the strongest salary growth even though they’re not necessarily projected to be the highest salaries in the market” Gorton said.

Data scientists will also be rewarded for their expertise and specialisation she added.

Soft skills business acumen in high demand

But soft skills such as communication and emotional intelligence – will be well-remunerated in the coming years too according to Adecco Australia managing director Kelly Van Nelson.

“The ability for employees to deal with uncertainty pressure and to continue working at their best during tough times is what will set them apart from the rest” she said highlighting resilience as a particularly important quality.

But the rare workers who combine both tech skills business acumen and soft skills will be the true winners. For example financial planners and business analysts that can help businesses navigate a post-pandemic world will be in a stronger position to negotiate salaries said Gorton.

“By 2025 it’s expected that the highest earning roles will be those which have evolved to leverage new technology to enhance a company’s capabilities and competitiveness in the market.

“In other words jobs that break down the barriers between IT and other business functions combining technology skills with commercial mindedness a high degree of business acumen and niche expertise.”

“Candidates who can enhance the value of their expertise and experience in these fields by developing knowledge of different systems proficiency with data analytics tools and their ability to implement and manage systems upgrades are likely to be on a path to the most highly rewarded careers in 2025.”

According to Robert Half and Adecco Australia these are the jobs that are seeing the highest salary growth:",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMioAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uYXBsZXNuZXdzLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9uZXdzL2NvbHVtbmlzdHMvaW4tdGhlLWtub3cvMjAyMS8wMS8zMS9uYXBsZXMtcmVhbC1lc3RhdGUtZGVhbC1uZXRzLTM2LW1pbGxpb24tYmVhY2hmcm9udC1tYW5zaW9uLXNvdXRod2VzdC1mbG9yaWRhLzQzMDEwMzgwMDEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,In the Know: Biggest real estate deal in nearly three years nets $36 million beachfront mansion,"So the home didn't go for the $58 million that the trust of a former Westinghouse Electric executive originally listed it for seven years ago in Naples.

But this past week's $36 million purchase of a Port Royal gulf-front mansion still ranks as the priciest in about three years in Southwest Florida according to Matt Simmons a principal of real estate appraisal firm Maxwell Hendry & Simmons.

The 18172 square feet at 2750 Gordon Drive featured a five-car ""collectors"" garage a 500-bottle wine room and a half-dozen bedrooms after a $3.5 million renovation for Robert A. Watson former president and chief executive officer of units of Westinghouse and TransAmerica.

Built in 1999 and called “La Campana"" the Italian Renaissance-style palace with its marble floors and fireplace included a beachside game room his and hers studies a two-story rotunda an elevator and a mahogany bar with green marble top. With 14 full and half baths you had your choice of multiple bidets and jetted tubs.

Near a cabana with a full kitchen dancing fountains surrounded a zero-edged pool on the 1.55 acres overlooking the sands of the Gulf of Mexico and two doors away from the exclusive Port Royal Club. The 2019 property tax bill: $238058 on tax assessed value of $23.3 million.

The price tag has been dropping over the years $51.9 million in August 2017 and $42.5 million in December 2018. Zillow estimates its current value at $18.6 million.

The Randal D. Bellestri Living Trust had unloaded it for $27.3 million in December 2011 to serve as Watson's castle. When the Watson trust first put the palazzo on the market three years later the costliest ever sold in Naples up to that time had also been a Bellestri acquisition for $47.25 million at 3100 Gordon Drive in 2012.

In September 2014 Bellestri was sentenced to a year in prison and fined $500000 for filing false tax returns and conspiracy to file false tax returns.

That Bellestri home has been listed at $39.9 million and Simmons said it had an agreed-upon contract as of early January.

With the brand new purchase of the Watson residence near the end of the week public records were incomplete and the agents weren't available to fill in some of the blanks such as the buyer's name. However my colleagues and I plan to keep checking back.

This is the most expensive since 2500 Gordon sold for the highest ever at $48 million in June 2018. Since that time it has been torn down and Simmons said there have been four Southwest Florida sales between $22 million and $28 million.

""It can be very difficult to sell a property like this"" he said. ""The pool of buyers is very small and the marketing efforts need to be surgical. With a median-priced home you can cast a wide net in exposing the home because it’s hitting the middle of the pool of buyers. Unique properties in general require a lot of skill in how they are marketed but properties like this are on a different level entirely. It’s much more personal relationship-oriented and targeted. It’s not easy to navigate transactions like these but Southwest Florida has a number of superb professional agents who are elite at what they do and know how to deliver on transactions like these.""

Not many folks can afford the newly sold pad and it would even ""still be a reach"" if you had the winning $1 billion Mega Millions ticket about a week ago Simmons said.

If you took the lump sum which Simmons recommends it would probably be somewhere in the neighborhood of $461 million in this state.

""For a Florida winner taking the lump sum buying something for $36 million assuming they don’t have wealth otherwise would represent about 8% of your net worth"" Simmons said. ""For most Americans their home equity represents usually 15-30% of their net worth. But for the category of the ultra-wealthy talking $200 million-$250 million-plus they typically have less than 5% of their net worth in a house. Being worth $461 million and having 8% of that in a residence is actually out of line for how most ultra-wealthy folks allocate their funds. Of course that’s not always the case. But that’s the typical ratio.""

If you go the annuity payment route and that still means paying the taxes up front then it's three years before you would probably have enough to cover the total cost of the digs as long as you don't spend that cash on anything else along the way.

That property used to be part of the newly sold 2750 Gordon parcel and previously had been owned by D.L.

Robert Pires makes prediction on Arsenal's season and gives verdict on Mikel Arteta

Robert Pires claims Arsenal can still finish in the top four and insists the club's future ""looks bright"" with Mikel Arteta at the helm.

Only last month the Gunners found themselves as low as 15th in the Premier League after a dreadful run of five defeats and two draws.

But the north London club have turned things around since Christmas winning five of their last six games to arrive back in the top half of the table.

With seven points separating Arsenal from fourth place and just under half the season remaining Pires sees no reason why his former club cannot continue their recovery and push for Champions League qualification.

Pires - who made 287 appearances for Arsenal - told The Sun : “Mikel is young and needs time to implement his ideas but I believe that once he has built his team Arsenal will be competitive and ready to go toe-to-toe with the great English clubs.

""It’s hard but I would not even rule out that they finish in the top four and qualify for the Champions League this year because things change quickly in the league.

“If I see Liverpool having tough periods I’m telling myself there is an opportunity for Arsenal to grab.

“They only need to get back to winning ways and then maintain the consistency. Then anything can happen.

“It’s imperative the supporters stay patient because Arsenal are in transition but the club’s future under Arteta looks bright.”

Arteta has turned to his talented crop of youngsters in recent outings with Bukayo Saka Emile Smith Rowe and Gabriel Martinelli helping the Gunners rise up the table.

Pires has been impressed by the Spaniard's management of his squad and insists he is the man to take Arsenal forward.

The French World Cup winner added: “I believe that Arteta is the right manager to rebuild the team.

“I’m optimistic for the club’s future because I see many quality players not least the young players that have come through lately.

“Besides Arteta played at a high level with Arsenal and was also Pep Guardiola’s assistant at Man City. The fact he played for the club means he knows the way Arsenal are supposed to play.”

Despite chronic wage stagnation in Australia certain job sectors – like healthcare trades and government – are currently experiencing salary growth and tech skills soft skills and business know-how will be prized.

COVID-19 has also accelerated the growth of some industries; for example those in aged care the disability sector and mining and infrastructure are seeing notable pay increases.

Tech skills are still #1

Thanks to COVID-19’s acceleration of remote work and the digitisation of the workplace those with digital and technological skills will be in greater demand over the coming years.

“When it comes to salary growth technology jobs are in a stronger position compared to many other positions in the market” Robert Half director Nicole Gorton told Yahoo Finance.

Businesses across all industries are investing more heavily into artificial intelligence and robotics she said.

With the international travel ban still in place hiring managers are struggling to fill specialised IT roles.

“Both these forces are placing upward pressure on tech salaries as companies compete for the right talent to help them prepare for the future of work.”

Nearly 7 in 10 chief information officers surveyed by Robert Half said they were willing to pay more to secure top talent in IT.

“With the trend likely to continue for the next few years we expect roles such as cyber-security specialists DevOps and cloud engineers as well as front end software developers to show the strongest salary growth even though they’re not necessarily projected to be the highest salaries in the market” Gorton said.

Data scientists will also be rewarded for their expertise and specialisation she added.

Soft skills business acumen in high demand

But soft skills such as communication and emotional intelligence – will be well-remunerated in the coming years too according to Adecco Australia managing director Kelly Van Nelson.

Story continues

“The ability for employees to deal with uncertainty pressure and to continue working at their best during tough times is what will set them apart from the rest” she said highlighting resilience as a particularly important quality.

But the rare workers who combine both tech skills business acumen and soft skills will be the true winners. For example financial planners and business analysts that can help businesses navigate a post-pandemic world will be in a stronger position to negotiate salaries said Gorton.

“By 2025 it’s expected that the highest earning roles will be those which have evolved to leverage new technology to enhance a company’s capabilities and competitiveness in the market.

“In other words jobs that break down the barriers between IT and other business functions combining technology skills with commercial mindedness a high degree of business acumen and niche expertise.”

Traditional departments such as finance marketing and HR will prize new hires that also have tech skills she added.

“Candidates who can enhance the value of their expertise and experience in these fields by developing knowledge of different systems proficiency with data analytics tools and their ability to implement and manage systems upgrades are likely to be on a path to the most highly rewarded careers in 2025.”

Industry 4.0. Smart factories. Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). Manufacturing on demand. The list of buzzwords around how the world will completely digitize the manufacture of every widget imaginable goes on and on. These factories of the future will link every machine and robot each mapped down to the micron in a cloud-based digital twin. AI algorithms will automate the manufacturing process from end to end with technologies like 3D printing taking on an outsized role. At least that’s what they tell you in the slide decks. A startup called Oqton is angling to be a key player in the industry 4.0 market with its own smart factory operating system (OS) built around additive manufacturing.

Smart Manufacturing Startup

Founded in 2017 Oqton claims San Francisco as its birthplace but Ghent Belgium serves as the company’s headquarters. It suddenly popped on everybody’s radar this month after raising a $40 million Series A in its first publicly disclosed fundraising.

Most of the names on the investor list will be unfamiliar outside of certain geographies or manufacturing circles but there are a couple of notable individuals on board. For example the CEO of Autodesk (ADSK) a $60-billion-plus software company originally known for a design and drafting application called AutoCAD is a fan. There’s also a guy named Dries Buytaert who 20 years ago developed Drupal one of the most popular website content management systems not called WordPress. And there’s Sandvik (SAND.ST) a Swedish engineering firm with revenue of more than $12 billion in 2019.

So what is Oqton doing to gain the confidence of these and other investors? In effect the company has produced a smart manufacturing cloud-based platform that runs a job from design to production to certification – and everything in between.

No it’s not a design for a bridge that Elon Musk wants to build on Mars but actually a jewelry design. Credit: Oqton

The company has built in a number of algorithms that automate and optimize the entire process while enabling the system to continuously learn and get better at making the best widget as expediently as possible. Oqton claims that in some of its key verticals (for example jewelry and dental) it has already achieved total automation which has decreased costs by up to 30%.

Smart Manufacturing Using AI

Let’s follow the “digital thread” as Oqton calls it to see how AI is used in each phase of its smart manufacturing platform which can also integrate other kinds of traditional production technologies like welding.

Design : The software automatically classifies parts based on geometric and production data and uses AI to continuously refine classification accuracy. Algorithms also go to work to produce the most optimal supports for additive manufacturing in terms of strength and weight.

: See below. Certify: There’s probably AI in there somewhere but you probably get the point by now – Oqton is trying to perfect a turnkey automation platform for smart manufacturing with 3D printing as the primary production technique.

A Piece of Hardware

While Oqton is all about the software it has developed an inspection machine that conducts a 3D analysis of parts with an accuracy of 30 micrometers which is a fraction to the thousandth place of an inch. Wee friggin’ small. In just seconds the machine identifies any design deviations such as problems with dimensions curvature or color among others for widgets up to 20 inches in size.

It’s either the AI-powered inspection machine or the company’s proprietary breakroom microwave. Credit: Oqton

And of course algorithms help improve results over time especially for testing of specialty parts.

Conclusion

We wrote about the specific topic of manufacturing-as-a-service just last month as part of the continued maturation of the 3D printing industry from mainly a side hustle for manufacturers to mainstream adoption. The fact that Oqton could land $40 million certainly speaks to that thesis even if the market is generally going apeshit and flinging feces and 3D printing stock prices higher. We know automation and anything that keeps people perpetually underemployed sheltered in place is trending with investors so maybe it was an easy sell for Oqton.

In terms of market potential there are some smart manufacturing reports out there but nothing that we would trust with estimates running from $10 billion to nearly $400 billion in the next few years. Perhaps a better measure of where this could go for a company like Oqton is the example of one of its key investors Autodesk which now sells software that includes not just architecture and engineering but genetic engineering and even media. That begs the question: What are some of the software companies that will dominate the Fourth Industrial Age? It’s definitely too early to forecast that for Oqton with investor Sandvik probably its biggest client at least in terms of stature.

WWE Hall of Famer Edge is going to WrestleMania 37.

The Rated R Superstar won tonight's 30-Man Royal Rumble Match at the WWE Royal Rumble pay-per-view from Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg FL. The match came down to Edge and Orton.

Edge entered the match at #1 and Orton entered at #2 but Orton spent much of the match in the trainer's room after an injury angle with his leg. Orton entered the match after it looked like Edge had won but this backfired and Edge eliminated him for the big win.

The match featured several surprise entrants and WWE NXT Superstars including a returning Seth Rollins Carlito Damian Priest Kane ""The Hurricane"" Shane Helms and Christian.

The match also saw rapper Bad Bunny get involved. Earlier in the night there was a segment where Bunny turned down an offer to join The Miz and John Morrison after Bunny performed his ""Booker T"" single on the stage. WWE Hall of Famer Booker T interrupted the segment and sent Miz and Morrison on their way. Miz later destroyed Bunny's DJ Set when he made his Rumble entrance. Bunny came out during the match and distracted both Miz and Morrison allowing Priest to eliminate them. Priest then cheered Bunny on as he climbed to the top rope and delivered a splash to the floor taking Miz and Morrison down.

According to information provided by Westridge Development all five stores are under lease and coming to West Ridge Commons.

“Those are just the beginning” said County Commissioner Tom Bloom. “There are some others we’re negotiating with but this has been a two year process and we’re very excited because we are in the pandemic and most stores are having difficulty just maintaining the stores they have.”

Officials say the development is welcome news.

“We have an area where the community along I-79 believe this could be a booming area” said Bloom.

Charles Hammond (C.H.) Ross was born in Hull England in 1829. He came to the U.S. with his father’s family in 1835 and stayed with an uncle on Staten Island New York until 1844 when he joined his family in Innisfil Township. He worked on the family farm for the next two years.

In 1848 when he was 19 years old Ross moved to town and was hired as a clerk in Thomas David McConkey’s general store. He worked there for 10 years before they formed a partnership: McConkey and Ross.

McConkey’s store was located on Dunlop Street in the building next to the Barrie Hotel (now the Queen’s Hotel). It was built in 1866 for McConkey – the Bank of Commerce was in the west unit Sanders Brothers (jewelers) in the centre and T.D.’s store in the unit next to the Queen’s Hotel. Since it was a brick building it prevented the spread of a fire in 1880 which destroyed the buildings west of McConkey’s up to Owen Street.

In 1858 Ross and other local Reformers launched a new weekly newspaper The Spirit of the Age. C.H. was a Presbyterian and a lifelong Reformer.

On Oct. 13 1859 Charles married Mary Cowan George formerly of Ireland by way of Boston. Charles and Mary never had any children of their own however they did raise three nieces: Annie Louise Mary Emma and Georgina.

The partnership with his brother-in-law McConkey (T.D. was married to C.H.’s sister Mary) continued until McConkey retired in 1865. In 1868-9 Ross had his home Maple Hill built at the corner of Toronto and Wellington streets. The house originally had a verandah on three sides and although there have been other changes over the years the beautiful home and estate grounds have mostly remained intact to this day. Ross’ sister’s place was pretty impressive as well: the McConkeys lived a few blocks to the east in Ardtrae – Barrie’s enduring and iconic mansion located at 101 Clapperton St. at Wellington Street.

After T.D. retired Ross brought Donald Gilchrist into the mercantile business as partner in Ross and Gilchrist. When their partnership ended after five years C.H. ran the company alone for another five years before retiring himself in 1878 after 30 years in the business.

In addition to running his general store C.H. was elected to town council in 1872 and served four terms. Ross also served as Barrie’s fifth mayor from 1887-8 then police magistrate in 1891. Also in 1891 C.H. built the Ross Block of commercial buildings on Dunlop Street to the east of Post Office (Memorial) Square.

As things go for many months C.H.’s health had been in decline and on Feb. 14 1912 he passed away of heart failure at his home Maple Hill. Only two years later in 1914 his wife Mary passed away as well.

The Ross’ niece Georgie’s brother-in-law James Alexander MacLaren bought Maple Hill in 1914. Alex was editor and co-publisher of the Examiner from 1895 until 1951. The MacLarens – Mac and Maddie – were very involved in several organizations around town: the Carnegie Library Board Royal Victoria Hospital Board  Board of Education St. Andrew’s Presbyterian Church the Public Utilities Commission the Red Cross and the Horticultural Society.

Their son Maurice (Alexander Fitzmaurice MacLaren) carried on the family tradition of supporting his community. MacLaren helped to establish the Huronia Festival of the Arts the arboretum in Sunnidale Park the Barrie Yacht Club and sponsored construction of the lighthouse at Johnson’s Beach.

MacLaren bequeathed Maple Hill to the City of Barrie and the Barrie Gallery Project for use as an art gallery upon his death in 1989.

Maple Hill is a designated property under the Ontario Heritage Act for its architectural and historical significance.

The MacLaren Art Centre moved to its current location in the former Barrie Public Library/Carnegie building in 2001. Since that time Maple Hill has been home to various education and day care businesses.",,,

In a series of Instagram posts the grandson Jack Schlossberg 31 variously called Mr. Kennedy 70 a “prick” suggested he was using steroids said he was “lying to us” and portrayed him as a Russian stooge and a stalking horse for Donald J. Trump.

This big-mouthed sports car promised two-plus-two seating in an even smaller lighter package than the 86 contrasting the two-seat Mazda. Though the S-FR fell off the radar Toyota apparently didn't forget about it as Japanese media indicates the S-FR is finally cleared for production.

Citing Best Car Magazine which typically publishes original reporting in print before sharing it online Forbes says the S-FR will launch in late 2026 or early 2027. It's reported to be in co-development with Daihatsu and Suzuki which were previously rumored to be working on a small mid-engined model together. It seems that project has evolved into a more conventional front-engined rear-wheel-drive coupe that'll become the S-FR—with a larger more powerful engine.

Toyota S-FR Racing Concept. Toyota

Specifically the S-FR is reported to use a three-cylinder turbo engine making around 150 horsepower to turn the rear wheels. Curiously rumors of a revived Toyota Starlet with a GR performance version specify a similar engine; 150 hp from a 1.3-liter engine downsized from the one in the GR Corolla. This also matches the displacement of the engine in the Daihatsu Vision Copen concept from October which would seem to preview Toyota's next sports car. Or at least Daihatsu's version of it.

The S-FR's design will reportedly be overhauled for production with a smaller grille and altered headlights. There was no word as to the potential implementation of the S-FR Racing concept pictured above with its aggressive rear wing canards splitter and diffuser. These could feasibly be offered as accessories or even as exclusives on a hypothetical GR model. That's purely speculative on our part though.

Price-wise Toyota is reportedly targeting the equivalent of $22700. That wouldn't just undercut the Mazda MX-5 by around $6000 but also make it one of the cheapest new cars on sale in the U.S. period—if it makes it here. Toyota is reportedly undecided about selling the S-FR in the States where it already sells the similar GR86. Offering both could easily cannibalize sales potentially without taking as much share of Mazda's pie as intended.

There's also the question of where it'd fit with the supposed Celica reboot which could culminate in a thrifty fun rear-wheel-drive coupe to compete with the Honda Prelude. It too seems like it'd contend for S-FR and GR86 customers weakening the prospects for all involved. If the S-FR does come around my money's on it staying out of the States just like the Starlet is supposed to. I mean with Mazda locking down the small sports car market and the GR86 addressing one size up why even bother?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVuaC5lZHUvdW5odG9kYXkvMjAyNC8wNS9lbGl6YWJldGgtcy1jaGlsdG9uLW5hbWVkLTIxc3QtcHJlc2lkZW50LXVuaXZlcnNpdHktbmV3LWhhbXBzaGlyZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Elizabeth S. Chilton Named 21st President of the University of New Hampshire,"Following a national search Elizabeth S. Chilton a native of the Northeast who most recently served as chancellor of Washington State University’s Pullman campus has been appointed the 21st president of the University of New Hampshire effective July 1 2024.

Chilton will succeed James W. Dean Jr. who is retiring after six years leading UNH. She was appointed the inaugural chancellor of Washington State’s Pullman campus in 2022 after joining WSU in 2020 as provost and executive vice president of the WSU system.

“UNH is a leading public university with strong student outcomes a large and diverse research portfolio and dedication to the state of New Hampshire and I am honored and humbled to have the opportunity to serve as president of this incredible institution” Chilton says. “I’ve long admired UNH’s history vibrant and engaged community and commitment to student success and scholarship. I look forward to returning to the Northeast to join the Wildcat family and help UNH serve our students and society in pursuit of a prosperous future.”

WSU Pullman is the system’s flagship and Washington State’s land grant university serving about 18000 students. Prior to becoming chancellor her role as chief academic officer included oversight of research functions across the six-campus system a role she continued in while serving as chancellor for the last two years.

A first-generation college student and a graduate of public universities Chilton is a champion for public higher education deeply committed to access and liberal arts education. She values UNH’s unique position as a leading public research institution that maintains a sharp focus on undergraduate education inspired by the university’s research mission while also remaining a strong believer in the power of a transformational undergraduate experience.

“Dr. Chilton has shown tremendous leadership and strategic vision across the academic and research enterprise and her career is a testament to the mission of public higher education” said Jamie Burnett ‘95 ‘96G ‘98G the vice-chair of the University System of New Hampshire Board of Trustees and chair of the presidential search committee. “She cares deeply about the student experience and is committed to advancing student success at UNH. She has a record of collaboration lifting up her peers building partnerships and creating opportunities. The UNH community and the state should have a high degree of confidence in Elizabeth’s appointment.”

Chilton’s appointment concludes a search launched last fall after Dean announced his intention to retire. A 16-member search committee comprised of representatives of the Board of Trustees faculty staff and students across UNH’s three campuses led the search.

Chilton will visit all three UNH campuses from May 9 to 11. She will spend May 9 and a portion of May 10 in Durham before visiting the Manchester and Concord campuses on the afternoon of the 10th.

“Elizabeth is a proven and versatile leader devoted to the mission and values of public land grant universities” said USNH Board Chair Alex Walker. “She brings the experience track record and capabilities to lead a multi-campus institution that is part of a larger well-coordinated public higher education system. She distinguished herself among a very strong pool of candidates as the right person to lead the University of New Hampshire in these dynamic and challenging times in higher education.”

From 2017 to 2020 Chilton was dean of the Harpur College of Arts and Sciences at Binghamton University part of the State University of New York system. Prior to that she spent 16 years at the University of Massachusetts Amherst serving in a variety of roles including professor anthropology department chair and associate vice chancellor for research and engagement.

She earned her bachelor’s degree in anthropology from the University at Albany SUNY and then her master’s and Ph.D. in anthropology from the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Her academic work focuses on the pre-colonial archaeology of Northeast North America as well as paleoecology cultural resource management heritage studies and materials science. She is the author of dozens of peer-reviewed book chapters and journal articles.

Chilton is an avid hiker kayaker and canoeist as well as an enthusiastic choral singer. Her husband Michael Sugerman is also an anthropology professor. The couple has an adult son and three lively dogs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndrYm4uY29tL215LXZhbGxleS10cmlidXRlcy9yb3NzaS1icm90aGVycy1sZWxsaW8tZnVuZXJhbC1ob21lL2thcmVuLXMtcmVudHoteW91bmdzdG93bi1vaGlvL9IBbWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndrYm4uY29tL215LXZhbGxleS10cmlidXRlcy9yb3NzaS1icm90aGVycy1sZWxsaW8tZnVuZXJhbC1ob21lL2thcmVuLXMtcmVudHoteW91bmdzdG93bi1vaGlvL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Karen S.

So says portfolio manager Paul Harris of Harris Douglas Asset Management.

“One of the things with Salesforce is that it has acquired a lot of businesses with Slack being their biggest purchase” said Harris partner at Harris Douglas who spoke on BNN Bloomberg on Thursday. “And so I think it all comes down to how does Salesforce integrate Slack into their other businesses and I think some of Salesforce’s acquisitions in the past have not been integrated that well.”

Salesforce dropped the news on December 1 that it had a definitive agreement to acquire messaging platform Slack for about $26.8 billion in cash and 0.0776 Salesforce shares for every Slack share. Already a customer relationship management (CRM) giant Salesforce said combining forces with Slack was “a match made in heaven” according to CEO Marc Benioff who said the merger would bring about “the future of enterprise software” and “transform the way everyone works.”

The initial response by the market was none too bright however although investor reaction on December 1 was also mixed with impressions of the company’s simultaneously-released third quarter results which forecasted slower-than-expected growth up ahead.

Salesforce’s share price did exceedingly well for almost all of the 2010-2020 period including last year where the stock returned 37 per cent. But CRM stalled over the last few months of 2020 and then hit a pretty significant pullback with the twin December 1 releases. Since then the stock has been flat.

But Salesforce is nothing if not ambitious. Benioff has been clear about his plans to double the company’s revenue from the $25.5-billion projected for its fiscal 2022.

“I have a $50 billion (revenue) dream which is what I’m shooting for” Benioff said on CNBC’s Mad Money on December 1. “I feel very excited and motivated on everything that we need to do to double the company once again and to make that happen we have to architect a complete solution.”

Salesforce reported fiscal third quarter 2021 revenue of $5.42 billion up 20 per cent year-over-year and EPS of $1.15 per share compared to a loss of $0.12 per share a year earlier. Analysts were calling for $5.25 billion in revenue and earnings of $0.75 per share. Looking ahead management guided for fiscal fourth quarter earnings of $0.73-$0.74 on revenue between $5.665 and $5.675 billion. (All figures in US dollars.)

Harris said Salesforce which recently joined the 30 companies that make up the Dow Jones Industrial Average will need to get even bigger if it’s looking to take on Microsoft.

“The issue with Salesforce is is the idea to compete with Microsoft (which is what some people think) and the other thing is how do they integrate that into a lot of what they presently do?” Harris said.

“If it is to compete with Microsoft then they are probably going to have to make more acquisitions to compete on things like Microsoft Teams and its Office products” Harris said. “But acquisitions are always scary things because they’re all about execution. And [Slack] is now their biggest acquisition so I think that’s really the key story over the next several quarters and maybe even the next several years: how they integrate it and actually grow their business.”

Slack also delivered quarterly earnings on December 1 where its third quarter fiscal 2021 featured revenue up 39 per cent year-over-year to $234.5 million and positive earnings of $0.01 per share. Both top and bottom lines beat analysts’ estimates.

Slack which went public in a much-anticipated IPO in early 2019 is seeing strong uptake of its platform while the company registered 12000 net paid customer additions up 140 per cent year-over-year. At the same time it’s unclear whether Slack will be come the widespread work communication model of choice going forward something Salesforce is betting on.

“Remember Slack was given away for free basically and then you have to pay for an upgraded thing if you want” said Harris “so how Salesforce brings the rest of their clients onto Slack and whether or not they’ll pay those are the big questions. I don’t think you’re see answers for the next little while so the stock may be volatile because of that.”

“It’s hard to judge growth companies. The best way to look at these things is [ask] do their businesses have a moat? Are they almost not monopolies but oligopolistic in their nature that they can actually control their business?” Harris said.

“Salesforce has been able to grow their business very aggressively over the last several years [but] I think one of the things that analysts have found very difficult about the story is that they constantly beat their numbers but it’s been hard for analysts to gauge their what the company is going to do whether they’re going to get to $50 billion or not” Harris said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhYXN0ci5jb20vNS1pbnRlcmVzdGluZy1sZWFybmluZ3MtZnJvbS1zZXJ2aWNlbm93LWF0LTUtYmlsbGlvbi1pbi1hcnIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,5 Interesting Learnings From ServiceNow at $5 Billion in ARR,"5 Interesting Learnings From ServiceNow at $5 Billion in ARR

So ServiceNow for many of us is a SaaS company we’ve sort of heard of but don’t know that much about. There’s a reason. They just crossed 1100+ $1m ACV customers! Now that’s enterprise! So you probably don’t use ServiceNow yourself to track your IT and other assets.

But bigger customers sure do. And ServiceNow has now joined Salesforce Shopify and Zoom at another SaaS leader worth a stunning $100 Billion (!)

Let’s take a look at 5 Interesting Learnings:

1. Still growing 32% at $5B in ARR. This is pretty stunning and justifies the $100B market cap. Even at $5B in ARR ServiceNow is still growing at 32% year-over-year. And much faster than most peers at this scale.

2. 1100 $1m+ ACV customers — and the customer count here is still growing 23%. This is again pretty stunning. Not only has ServiceNow crossed 1100 customers paying $1m a year or more … but the momentum is still continuing. $1m+ customers are growing 23% by logo! ServiceNow has hardly maxxed out its large customer base yet compared to say Salesforce’s CRM segment which is quite mature.

3. New Products and Workflows Fuel Growth After $1B in ARR. We see this again and again with Box with Datadog with Veeva with Twilio and more. The “core” product often takes you quite far — farther than you’d think — but as some side of $1B in ARR you need another product to fuel growth from the customer base. ServiceNow’s core IT workflow product is now just 62% of its total revenues with its expansion into customers and employee workflows now ~25% of revenues and its platform up to 15% from just 10% a year back.

4. Waited to monetize platform like Shopify Zendesk etc. Building on the prior point ServiceNow’s revenues from its platform didn’t cross 10% of its overall revenue until 2019. We see many SaaS leaders waiting before taking too much out of the pockets of their partners. It’s almost always better to wait unless your platform is your product. It’s almost always better to get every partner building on your platform and taking a bigger rake later.

5. A stunning 99% logo retention rate. 99% of their customers stay year after year. Now as we’ll see below they do sign 3+ year contracts :). But still it’s a stunning example of keeping enterprise customers for life.

Some bonus learnings:

6. Only 5% of its revenues from professional services. This is a bit of a surprise and a big contrast to some other enterprise players like Qualtrics Veeva etc. The number is in some ways artificially low in that like Salesforce ServiceNow has built up a large ecosystem of partners to handle deployments configuration and other lower-margin professional services. It’s still interesting to see it so low however.

7. 36% of Revenue from Outside North America. Similar to what we see with others with 26% from Europe/EMEA and 10% from APAC. Don’t be too U.S. focused even in the early days. This is basically how SaaS looks today. 60% or so of the revenue is still in the U.S. But 40% isn’t. If it does find you don’t run from it. Embrace it.

8. New Customers Sign 3 Year Contracts Renewals for 2 Years. It’s interesting to see contract terms presented this way. We’ve seen leaders like Qualtrics standardize on 1 year contracts and others like Zoom keep plenty of shorter-term customers. But ServiceNow isn’t doing that. You sign a 3 year contract to start and a 2 year renewal. With a $1m+ ACV buy-out contracts will be a tough strategy for the competition.

In class I was introduced to the concepts of batteries and electrochemical cells. I am really interested in batteries and how they work and what goes into making a battery.

The Theory Of Batteries And Electrochemical Cells

I was inspired to this experiment mostly because I want to study electrical engineering in university and I wanted to find out the chemistry behind the production of the electrical energy in batteries. During my reading I found out that the first battery was actually invented by Italian physicist Count Alessandro Volta and was. Determination of an Electrochemical Series In electrochemistry a voltaic cell is a specially prepared system in which an oxidation-reduction reaction occurs spontaneously.

This spontaneous reaction produces an easily measured electrical potential which has a positive value. Half-cells are normally produced by placing a piece of metal into a solution containing a cation of the metal e.

Of the electrochemical cells used there were two different types voltaic and concentration. Voltaic cells are composed of two half-cells with differing electrodes and solutions that result in a spontaneous flow of electrons from one half-cell to the other half-cell until equilibrium is met.

Electrochemical Cells Lab Essay

In Voltaic cells this flow of electrons is driven. Various different conditions such as electrode dimensions and background ion concentrations are shown to have a significant impact on the simulations. From being a simple interface the properties of the electrodes used in electrical and electrochemical biosensors can have a remarkable impact on the function and effectiveness of the resulting biosensor system.

The use of interdigitated electrodes IDEs in biosensor systems is one prominent.

NOW,ServiceNow,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhYXN0ci5jb20vNS1pbnRlcmVzdGluZy1sZWFybmluZ3MtZnJvbS1zZXJ2aWNlbm93LWF0LTUtYmlsbGlvbi1pbi1hcnIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,5 Interesting Learnings From ServiceNow at $5 Billion in ARR,"5 Interesting Learnings From ServiceNow at $5 Billion in ARR

So ServiceNow for many of us is a SaaS company we’ve sort of heard of but don’t know that much about. There’s a reason. They just crossed 1100+ $1m ACV customers! Now that’s enterprise! So you probably don’t use ServiceNow yourself to track your IT and other assets.

But bigger customers sure do. And ServiceNow has now joined Salesforce Shopify and Zoom at another SaaS leader worth a stunning $100 Billion (!)

Let’s take a look at 5 Interesting Learnings:

1. Still growing 32% at $5B in ARR. This is pretty stunning and justifies the $100B market cap. Even at $5B in ARR ServiceNow is still growing at 32% year-over-year. And much faster than most peers at this scale.

2. 1100 $1m+ ACV customers — and the customer count here is still growing 23%. This is again pretty stunning. Not only has ServiceNow crossed 1100 customers paying $1m a year or more … but the momentum is still continuing. $1m+ customers are growing 23% by logo! ServiceNow has hardly maxxed out its large customer base yet compared to say Salesforce’s CRM segment which is quite mature.

3. New Products and Workflows Fuel Growth After $1B in ARR. We see this again and again with Box with Datadog with Veeva with Twilio and more. The “core” product often takes you quite far — farther than you’d think — but as some side of $1B in ARR you need another product to fuel growth from the customer base. ServiceNow’s core IT workflow product is now just 62% of its total revenues with its expansion into customers and employee workflows now ~25% of revenues and its platform up to 15% from just 10% a year back.

4. Waited to monetize platform like Shopify Zendesk etc. Building on the prior point ServiceNow’s revenues from its platform didn’t cross 10% of its overall revenue until 2019. We see many SaaS leaders waiting before taking too much out of the pockets of their partners. It’s almost always better to wait unless your platform is your product. It’s almost always better to get every partner building on your platform and taking a bigger rake later.

5. A stunning 99% logo retention rate. 99% of their customers stay year after year. Now as we’ll see below they do sign 3+ year contracts :). But still it’s a stunning example of keeping enterprise customers for life.

Some bonus learnings:

6. Only 5% of its revenues from professional services. This is a bit of a surprise and a big contrast to some other enterprise players like Qualtrics Veeva etc. The number is in some ways artificially low in that like Salesforce ServiceNow has built up a large ecosystem of partners to handle deployments configuration and other lower-margin professional services. It’s still interesting to see it so low however.

7. 36% of Revenue from Outside North America. Similar to what we see with others with 26% from Europe/EMEA and 10% from APAC. Don’t be too U.S. focused even in the early days. This is basically how SaaS looks today. 60% or so of the revenue is still in the U.S. But 40% isn’t. If it does find you don’t run from it. Embrace it.

8. New Customers Sign 3 Year Contracts Renewals for 2 Years. It’s interesting to see contract terms presented this way. We’ve seen leaders like Qualtrics standardize on 1 year contracts and others like Zoom keep plenty of shorter-term customers. But ServiceNow isn’t doing that. You sign a 3 year contract to start and a 2 year renewal. With a $1m+ ACV buy-out contracts will be a tough strategy for the competition.

Picayune’s City Council is allegedly considering taking ownership of a now vacant industrial site that may be contaminated which is also near an old Superfund site.

According to a social media post by current Councilor Tammy Valente who is running for mayor in this year’s election “the top administration within the city has been pushing for over a year for us to vote to take over the old Valspar plant.”

The matter is listed on Tuesday’s upcoming Council meeting agenda set for Feb. 2 at 5 p.m. in City Hall.

When contacted by the Item Valente clarified that “the top administration” entails City Manager Jim Luke and City Operations Director Harvey Miller.

When the Item contacted Luke for comment he said he declined to comment on matters that were discussed during a closed session earlier this week. Luke is also running for mayor this year.

Valente and Councilor Wayne Gouguet are against the city taking ownership of the site until testing can be done to determine if contamination is present.

The property in question is adjacent to a Superfund site located between Palestine Road and Rosa Street. The Superfund site was cleaned by the Environmental Protection Agency due to creosote contamination. Cleanup of that site took years to complete.

According to a phase I site assessment report conducted on the old Valspar property in Sept. of 2020 the property in question is located at 210 Crosby Street in the city limits is comprised of 28 acres and has served as the location of several industrial businesses over the years that generated or used a number of types of hazardous substances.

The report states that the hazardous substances used on the property through the decades include the pigments of lead chromate lead molybdate and zinc chromate. Additionally the hazardous solvents include industrial grade versions of xylene toluene and MEK.

It was developed in the early 1950s by Crosby Forest Products Co. and included a creosote plant saw mill veneer mill Tung oil mill and a box facility the report states.

Through the years the property changed names but appears to have continuously produced wood preservation products under variations of the Crosby name until 1992 when Sunbelt Coatings assumed ownership. The last listed tenant of the property is Valspar who reportedly operated out of that facility from 2005 until 2017. Currently the property is owned by Sunbelt Coatings Inc. under the care of Sherwin Williams’ tax department.

The report also states “wastewater and sludge were generated as a result of onsite operations that included washing paint vats pots and blending machines with water and solvents. “Dating back to 1953 through circa 1974 wastewater was collected in an unlined concrete basin allowed to settle then pumped into an earthen settling pit prior to being released into a drainage ditch leading into Mill Creek to the west and south of the property” the report states.

Once use of the settling pit ceased the report states that it was “not backfilled or capped.”

The report goes on to say that the state of Mississippi provided the Crosby company operating at the time with a tolerance permit in 1972 that required the company to define wastewater disposal processes at the site and propose “a more effective treatment method.”

The next year an enclosed system was installed to recover and reuse the wastewater. Sludge generated from this new system “was landfilled onsite” the report states.

At some point the sludge was “eventually filled in drums and removed offsite.”

Valente said her concern is that the property has not been fully tested to see if contamination is present in the soil. She would like to see the city protect the taxpayers by getting a phase II analysis along with a baseline to know what if any contamination exists.

Since lead was listed as one of the potential hazardous materials used at the site Valente and Councilor Wayne Gouguet feel testing for that and other substances needs to be conducted so the city can make the best decision. But numerous requests to have that testing done have fallen on deaf ears she said. Valente is concerned that she will be out voted when the matter is discussed during Tuesday’s meeting.

“I’m afraid they already have four votes and I’m highly concerned” Valente said.

While the property is being offered up as a donation to the city Gouguet is concerned that if contamination is found on the grounds the city could be responsible for the price of the cleanup or potentially assume ownership of property that is unusable. He added that the property has been up for sale for about a decade leading him to question its value.

“Free is not always free. There is a reason it may be free. Big corporations don’t usually give something away that is of value for just a tax break” Gouguet said.",,,,,,,,,

That was the consolation prize most of us took into 2021 from 2020: Whatever else happens in this still-young year at least we’re all immune to shock. But as is often the case just when we think we’ve seen it all we get to see something new.

GameStop was this week’s something new. More specifically: the improbable and spectacular rally of its stock price — which as of this writing was roughly $336 a share. How it got there is hardly a story of great strategy or inspiring individual effort. In fact nothing major has changed over the last year about GameStop a Grapevine Texas-headquartered video game retailer with shops nestled in malls nationwide.

In fact GameStop has struggled over the last year as the pandemic has slowed physical commerce and over the past few years competition from downloadable game content has pushed its profitability down and forced it to shrink its physical footprint. This brought GameStop to the attention of two groups that ended up being key to the stock price’s massive growth over the last week. The first group included short-sellers who all invested heavily that GameStop’s share price would continue to fall. The second was a Reddit investing subgroup r/WallStreetBets.

The GameStop stock had been getting some positive feedback on the Reddit site for some time. But starting in January of 2021 that enthusiasm began coalescing with a distaste for the large institutional investors such as hedge funds which were heavily short on GameStop.

In early January r/WallStreetBets members began buying up GameStop stock which in turn pushed up the price. It rose from around $17 a share at the start of January to north of $330 today (Jan. 29). It was as one r/WallStreetBets told Wired: “a meme stock that really blew up.”

Blew up being the operative concept as the conflagration set off wild complaints by those institutional investors whose short positions were badly exposed by the onslaught of retail investors who seemed glad enough to expose them. Robinhood the day-trading app for retail traders where much of the GameStop buying happened is now being sued by its users for its decision to halt trading in GameStop and other suddenly explosive meme stocks. That move touched off the interest of legislators. And the entirely unpredictable situation has set off a flurry of think pieces asking the expected series of unanswerable questions:

Is this a victory for retail investors or the beginning of the end? Is this a David-and-Goliath story about Redditors vs. hedge funds? Is this the first crowdfunded short squeeze in the history of the market? Is this really a pump-and-dump scheme gone prime time? Will this destroy the stock market as we know it?

PYMNTS has answers to none of those questions — they require the crystal ball that remains on order but has not yet arrived. What we do have are unexpected consequences — the things that got a lot less press as the GameStop soap opera unfolded and dramatic statements echoed across the Twittersphere. Here are the things that flew under the radar.

The Movie Industry Is Saved?

GameStop got all the headlines because its stock price grew so explosively but it wasn’t the only meme stock that got love from the Reddit investment group. AMC the nation’s largest theater chain also rose with the tide with its stock price up 300 percent in trading on Wednesday (Jan. 27) according to reports. Which as it turns out might have been just enough of a boost to help the nation’s largest theater chain which is also a bellwether for the movie theater industry.

The stock surge allowed the chain to scoot a bit further back from falling over the edge into bankruptcy. AMC erased $600 million of debt through bond conversion as a result of the pickup and managed to parlay this week’s boost into another $300 million in capitalization.

AMC reported a $900 loss million in the third quarter of 2020 and it has long been speculated that its death was looking increasingly likely. This week’s stock boon it seems offered the theater chain another lifeline to make it through the spring and summer — and possibly into the post-COVID era.

And AMC is far from the weirdest follow-on stock that has joined the weird world of the Reddit rally. Blockbuster officially declared Chapter 11 in 2010 more or less ending its run as a company (a single location remains in Bend Oregon). On Wednesday its stock surged by 302 percent. BlackBerry stocks have also been on fire — up 150 percent since the start of 2021. Redditors it seems are more bullish on BlackBerry than BlackBerry executives according to reports. Three BlackBerry executives including the chief financial officer unloaded $1.7 million in the firm’s stock in the early days of this month’s meteoric share price spike.

The Mooch Sees Bitcoin’s Big Break in the Making

Will this upwelling of investment enthusiasm translate into a big boost for bitcoin? Anthony Scaramucci CEO of Skybridge Capital (and briefly the press secretary for former President Donald Trump) certainly thinks so.

“The activity in GameStop is more proof of concept that bitcoin is going to work” Scaramucci told Bloomberg adding “how are you going to beat that decentralized crowd? That to me is more affirmation about decentralized finance.”

And Scaramucci isn’t the only crypto enthusiast talking up the connection — and the possibility that the new wave of investment enthusiasts will flow to their shores. “Do you see this rage? Do you see this community channeling their anger at the system? What do you think happens when they find out what bitcoin actually is?” wrote one bitcoiner adding “[the] 2021 bull market could get bigger than any of us realize.”

But there is a pretty good reason to take all of their enthusiasm with a pretty big grain of salt — the WallStreetBets Redditors are decidedly not crypto enthusiasts at present to the extent that one is not allowed to mention it at all on the message board. The sub’s moderators do not approve any posts or comments with the words “bitcoin” “Ethereum” “cryptocurrency” or other related terms. Any violating posts are immediately removed and moderation is very actively enforced.

“No microcap (less than $1 billion market cap) cryptocurrencies SPACs or any other worthless securities that are susceptible to scams or pump & dump schemes” is officially written into the site’s rules.

Could this wave of investors buoyed by the power of bringing multi-billion-dollar hedge funds to their knees rush off to feel the rush that is crypto investing? After a meme stock explosion we aren’t ruling anything out — but we can be fairly certain that unlike this project they won’t be putting it together on the r/WallStreetBets board.

The Congressional Hearings Cometh

Politics makes for strange bedfellows or so the saying goes. Not nearly as strange as it turns out as Reddit investing which managed to create something that would have been hard to foresee ever existing — a point of agreement between Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Ted Cruz. Both agreed that Robinhood suspending trading on Thursday might require regulatory oversight. As the subsequent Twitter exchange revealed they will not be working together — but oversight might still be coming.

House Financial Services Chairwoman Maxine Waters (D-CA) put out a statement later on Thursday calling for a hearing. Incoming Senate Banking Committee Chair Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH) said in a statement on Thursday that the committee will hold a hearing on the “state of the stock market” in the future.

What happens next? Hard to say — experts are split on whether or not GameStop’s price will begin falling off just as rapidly as it shot up and if so when that will happen. What is clear is that if Robinhood’s goal was to disrupt the stock market it certainly succeeded — though probably not in the way they had expected.

And the disruption begat disruptions many of which as this year has proved no one expected.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBlbmluc3VsYWRhaWx5bmV3cy5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvamNwZW5uZXktYmVnaW5zLWxpcXVpZGF0aW9uLW9mLXN0b3JlLWFmdGVyLTI2LXllYXJzLWluLXNlcXVpbS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,JCPenney begins liquidation of store after 26 years in Sequim,"Sales to continue through tentative closure in mid-May

Liquidation of the Sequim JCPenney began on Jan. 21 and will last tentatively through mid-May after the store’s corporate leaders announced its closure in December. JCPenney opened in Sequim in 1995 in the former Safeway building. Matthew Nash/Olympic Peninsula News Group

SEQUIM — JCPenney in Sequim a retail staple for 26-plus years has began liquidation and plans to permanently close its doors in mid-May.

The sale at the store at 651 Washington St. started more than a month after staff learned of the store’s impending closure Dec. 10.

Moments upon entering the store Jan. 21 customers were saying the closure is “heartbreaking” and “terrible.”

“This is bad; we need this store” another customer said.

General Manager Beverly Nelson said progressive sales are starting at 20-50 percent and all sales will be final.

It’s still to be determined if employees will transfer to other stores following the closure Nelson said.

Susan Erdman of Port Angeles has worked on the store floor for 17 years worked for two general managers and met “a lot of great people” she said.

“It’s been a good store for Sequim” Erdman said. “People are going to miss it. They’ve been telling us ‘Where are we going to shop? What are we going to do now?’ ”

Sequim’s closure follows a “store optimization strategy” from new owners Simon Property Group and Brookfield Asset Management Inc. reporting plans to close up to 200 stores for financial restructuring following the retailer filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2020.

The Sequim JCPenney is the only one on the North Olympic Peninsula.

The next closest store is at the Kitsap Mall in Silverdale.

Sequim JCPenney moved from Port Angeles to the former Sequim Safeway store in 1995 at the Sequim Village Shopping Center.

Prior to the liquidation the store employed 35 part-time and full-time employees.

Salon

Some employees have moved on to other employment including all but one stylist at the JCPenney Styling Salon. Salon manager Rebecca Claymore will remain with the store as long as the salon remains open with the timeline unknown she said.

Last week she took remaining vacation time and she will be open this week for appointments from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday-Friday by stopping in or calling 360-681- 4047.

The last two stylists finished Jan. 15 Claymore said and all her stylists found local positions.

“People who knew the salon was closing called to see how we’re doing and if they could offer employment” she said. “It made me feel so good and it speaks well for this salon.”

Claymore said she loves the people who worked there and she’s “heard a lot of healing words from customers.”

She made the switch from Silverdale as a master stylist in August to lead the Sequim salon and was sad to learn about the closure a few months later.

With state regulations in place late last year they had to downsize from four to two stylists and from 50 percent to 25 percent capacity.

“We got creative (with hours)” Claymore said.

Store

JCPenney was founded in 1902. Sequim’s store remained open in 2017 after the company closed 138 stores nationwide. However it joins GameStop and Ulta Beauty as franchises to close in the city during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Erdman said in her years with the store she’s “seen a lot of ups and downs” but she plans to stay through the entirety of the closure.

“I have a granddaughter and I’m going to keep taking care of her a few days a week so I don’t want to mess that schedule up” she said.

As for what’s next after the closure Erdman says she’s not going to rush things in finding another job.

Sequim’s store won several corporate awards in recent years including the Chairman’s Award and the Founder’s Award the “highest distinction for excellence” according to JCPenney representatives.

Claymore who commutes from Poulsbo said she loves Sequim.

“It’s beautiful here and I’ve met so many neat people” she said. “I’ve always treated it like a little vacation when I come here.”

Logistics

JCPenney’s website states: “Items purchased prior to the start of the liquidation sale may be returned or exchanged throughout the entire liquidation sale.”

Gift cards from the store can be redeemed but not purchased at the Sequim location.

More information can be found here companyblog.jcpnewsroom.com/store closings on closures.

Property manager Michelle Ridgway with Sun Valley Realty said there’s been some interest in leasing the JCPenney space.

SWKS,Skyworks Solutions,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzAxLzMwL2JldHRlci1idXktc2t5d29ya3Mtc29sdXRpb25zLXZzLWJyb2FkY29tL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Better Buy: Skyworks Solutions vs. Broadcom,"Which Apple supplier will be the safer investment this year?

Skyworks Solutions (SWKS 0.85%) and Broadcom (AVGO -0.55%) are both diversified chipmakers that are tightly tethered to Apple (AAPL 0.38%). Skyworks generated 56% of its revenue from Apple in fiscal 2020 while Broadcom relied on the tech giant for 15% of its sales last year.

Skyworks produces wireless chips for the mobile automotive industrial and Internet of Things markets. Broadcom also sells wireless chips for a wide range of industries and it expanded into the infrastructure software market over the past two years by buying CA Technologies and Symantec's enterprise security unit.

I compared these two stocks last September and declared that Broadcom's lower dependence on Apple cheaper valuation and higher dividend made it a better buy than Skyworks. Since then Broadcom's stock price has rallied about 20% as Skyworks' stock price advanced just over 10%. But will my thesis hold up throughout the rest of 2021?

Let's take a fresh look at both chipmakers to see if Broadcom is still the better buy.

Which chipmaker is growing faster?

Skyworks and Broadcom have both experienced decelerating sales growth over the past three years but Broadcom has remained more resilient:

Revenue Growth (YOY) 2018 2019 2020 Skyworks 6% (13%) (1%) Broadcom 18% 8% 6%

Skyworks' revenue declined in 2019 as sluggish sales of smartphones including its loss of orders from the blacklisted tech giant Huawei offset its stronger sales of IoT and analog chips for other markets.

Some of those headwinds waned in 2020 but COVID-19 disruptions throttled its recovery in the first half of the year. However its revenue finally rose year over year in the fourth quarter as orders for its Sky5 5G chips accelerated.

Skyworks expects its content share gains in 5G devices especially Apple's iPhone 12 and the recovery of the automotive and industrial markets to boost its sales in fiscal 2021. Analysts expect its revenue to rise 18% this year and another 10% in fiscal 2022.

Broadcom's chip sales surged in 2018 fueled by robust demand from cloud and data center customers. It faced tougher comparisons in 2019 as those upgrades cooled and smartphone sales slowed down but its growing infrastructure software business cushioned that blow.

Broadcom's chip sales -- especially to networking auto and industrial customers -- dipped in 2020 as the COVID-19 crisis disrupted its supply chains. However its chip sales gradually stabilized and in the second half of the year as carriers and cloud customers upgraded their networks to address the rising bandwidth needs of remote work and stay-at-home activities. Its auto and industrial customers also came back online.

Meanwhile the stable growth of Broadcom's infrastructure software business offset the temporary weakness of its chipmaking business. Analysts expect that ongoing recovery along with strong sales of 5G devices to boost its revenue by 10% this year and another 4% in 2022.

Which company is more profitable?

Broadcom's superior revenue growth enabled it to generate stronger earnings growth than Skyworks over the past three years:

EPS Growth (YOY) 2018 2019 2020 Skyworks 12% (15%) (1%) Broadcom 30% 2% 4%

Analysts expect Skyworks' earnings to rise 24% in 2021 and another 15% in 2022 which are impressive growth rates for a stock that trades at just 18 times forward earnings. Skyworks pays a forward dividend yield of 1.2% and it's raised that payout annually for six straight years.

Broadcom's earnings are expected to climb 18% in 2021 and 7% in 2022. Those are also solid growth rates compared to its forward P/E ratio of 16. It pays a much higher forward yield of 3.1% and it's raised its payout annually for nine straight years.

Why I'm sticking with Broadcom

Skyworks still has lots of growth potential especially as it diversifies its core business away from smartphones and notches content share gains across other connected devices. However its overwhelming dependence on Apple troubles me especially since Apple has been gradually replacing third-party chips with its own silicon.

Therefore Broadcom's lower valuation higher yield and better-diversified business still make it a more attractive investment than Skyworks for 2021.

The property purchased by the duo was originally the country's biggest printer of labels for household goods before being bought by a catalogue firm.

Also included in their property portfolio is two flats in an old church in Highgate.

The publication reports that they have set up Coolabbey Ltd and Billco Ltd in relation to their growing collection of properties.

MailOnline have contacted representatives for comment.

Their latest venture will no doubt boost their bank accounts in the long-run after they suffered a financial loss during the coronavirus lockdown according to their filed accounts.

Their finances were hit hard by the pandemic as they lost out on lucrative work deals when the nation came to a halt.

Abbey and her other half Peter reportedly told their accountant that they weren't offered their usual commitments due to the Covid-19 outbreak.

The mother-of-four recently filed her books for her company Abigail Marie Clancy Ltd while Peter has also settled his account for his firm Baseforce Ltd.

According to the Sun the reports show that the couple's income will also be down next year due to the ongoing outbreak.

A note on the account read: 'Due to the outbreak of Covid-19 in March 2020 all non-essential businesses and shops were closed.'

'The associated 'lockdown' has had an effect on the company's operations after the balance sheet date resulting in a sharp down in its revenues.'

Kate Middleton played a pivotal role in healing the apparently ‘turbulent’ relationship between Prince William and Prince Charles reports claim.

The Duchess of Cambridge 39 is said to have been responsible for organising the family portrait to mark her father-in-law’s 70th birthday in 2018.

Three generations of the Royal Family including Prince Harry and Meghan Markle can be seen beaming in the snap.

They united for the photo amid claims Charles had been unhappy about the amount of time he spent with the Cambridges – whose Norfolk residence Anmer Hall is four hours away from the future King and wife Camilla’s Gloucestershire home Highgrove House.

An aide of Prince William 38 apparently said he was ‘not doing anything more for his father’ when the Duke was asked to appear in a TV programme celebrating Charles’s work for the Duchy of Cornwall the Daily Mail claims.

And William was also said to be displeased when his father issued an official photo of himself with his children George seven Charlotte five and two-year-old Louis in the background.

The Duke is also said to have expressed concerns after Charles told reporters how the gardens in Highgrove had been turned into a ‘toddler’s paradise’ for George then two.

But the once-frosty relationship between the father and son thawed thanks to Kate’s intervention it has been suggested.

William revealed in a previous interview: ‘I would like him to have more time with the children… to you know play around with the grandchildren.

‘When he’s there he’s brilliant but we need him there as much as possible.’

Now Charles is said to be increasingly seeking William’s opinion as the father and son spend more time side by side.

An aide reportedly said: ‘He’s giving William much more input.

‘He realises that his own reign will be a shorter one than his son’s and therefore it is crucial that William is involved in all long-term planning.

‘They have been spending more time together and are much more aligned.

‘Both are more comfortable in their own skin – and with each other.’

Another royal insider reportedly told Vanity Fair how Charles and William’s relationship is ‘solid and strong’ and ‘built on love and affection’.

Charles and William also appeared in another historic photo with the Queen and Prince George showing four generations of the Royal Family mixing Christmas puddings for charity last December.

Technically the Mazda Miata – the best-selling sports car of all time – is a Japanese product. But it was designed in Irvine and it flourished only because it was rooted in Southern California.

“No other country could have come up with something like that” says Tom Matano a Japanese-born transplant who ran Mazda’s design studio in Irvine when the Miata was created in 1989. “Southern California had the car culture and the car clubs. That’s where the trends got started.”

The hot rod was born in Southern California. Ditto for the custom car. The sports car movement took off out here and this used to be a mecca for the racing industry. So in 1973 when Toyota was trying to find a foothold in the U.S. market it created its Calty design studio near LAX to tap into the unique SoCal zeitgeist.

Over the next two decades virtually every carmaker with an American presence followed suit from Volvo in Camarillo to Nissan in San Diego. Although a few studios have closed since then there are still more than a dozen facilities in Orange Los Angeles and Ventura counties.

Irvine remains the epicenter of the design studio landscape. The manufacturers represented here include Mazda Ford Hyundai and Kia as well as EV upstarts Rivian and Karma. It’s no coincidence that this is also the home of three of the biggest players in the car prototyping business – Aria Sivax and Phiaro.

Ken Saward grew up in New York City and worked in suburban Detroit before moving to Irvine and designing the second-generation Miata in 1999. As soon as he got here he understood why Mazda had chosen to locate its stateside design operation in Irvine.

Proximity to Japan was one reason. The gargantuan size of the California car market was another. But Irvine’s appeal went deeper than the bottom line. As Saward puts it: “There’s something about the light in Southern California. Cars just sparkle out here.”

news@seacoastonline.com

PORTSMOUTH – The region is bracing for a heavy snow storm that forecasters expect to arrive Monday evening and continue into Tuesday.

Andy Pohl a meteorologist at the National Weather Center (NWS) in Gray Maine said about a foot of snow is likely in the Seacoast New Hampshire area and southern Maine in York County.

“We are tracking the storm system as it moves across the Midwest” Pohl said. “It will move to the Mid-Atlantic coast to the Gulf of Maine. The system will move south to north through Massachusetts and up into New Hampshire and Maine.”

The timing is still a little unclear and will be updated as the storm gets closer.

""I think snow will begin to fall in earnest on Monday at around 6 p.m.” he said. “The heaviest of the snow should happen between 7 p.m. and 7 a.m. The storm will continue through the day and will not be finished until Tuesday evening. Commuting will be a problem Tuesday morning.”

Temperatures frigid all weekend are expected to rise with the arrival of the storm reaching the high 20s and low 30s according to NWS forecasts.

Utility crews gear up for storm

Alec O’Meara spokesperson for Until said the company has a lot of coordinating calls set for Sunday as it monitors the approaching storm.

“We are reaching out to our third-party partners” said O’Meara. “We are making sure all of our resources are in place and we will be ready to go when the snow falls the hardest.”

O’Meara said that during a storm they carefully watch the consistency of the snowfall.

“If it’s warmer temperatures the snow will be wet and will stick to trees and power lines” said O’Meara. “That’s when we have power outages. If it’s colder the snow tends to be dryer and fluffier and there are not as many problems.”

Information is available at unitil.com. To report an outage call 1-888-301-7700.

William Hinkle representing Eversource said it is also monitoring the storm.

“We have 400-plus line tree and forest service workers ready to go” said Hinkle. “We will ship crews around to locations as they are needed.”

Hundreds of people have rallied in several French towns and cities in protests called by anti-capitalist and environmental groups against e-commerce giant Amazon.

Among the places where demonstrators staged rallies on Saturday was the small southern town of Fournes near Pont-du-Gard a World Heritage site where the United States-based company plans to set up a 38000-square-metre (400000-square-feet) facility.

Protesting at the site between 800 and 1000 people formed a human chain to show the size of the project with multicoloured balloons floated 18 metres (60 feet) up to indicate the height of the planned five-storey warehouse.

“It’s two years that the citizens of Fournes and its surroundings have fought against the installation of a giant Amazon warehouse” said Raphael Pradeau spokesman of French citizens’ activist group Attac.

“At the start they were a bit alone against everyone but they have succeeded in halting the project thanks to legal recourse” he added.

“We want to show that these are not small isolated fights and that we can mobilise hundreds of people who are ready to return to stop the work” said Pradeau.

‘Destructive model’

The campaigners view the retail giant as a prime factor in the urbanisation of farmland a process they say is contributing significantly to climate change and the loss of environmental biodiversity.

Amazon’s global revenues have soared during the pandemic and its ability to keep selling during coronavirus lockdowns has deepened frustration among French opponents who say it represents a US-style mass consumer culture at odds with a long local tradition of neighbourhood stores.

The protesters also planted shrubs in front of huge banners reading “Stop Amazon” and “Not here or anywhere”.

“These plants these shrubs that we are planting today are a symbol of life that contrasts with the concretisation that Amazon practises” said 38-year-old Sarah Latour 38 who had brought her two sons aged six and eight.

“I came with my children because I don’t want this destructive model for them” she told AFP news agency.

About 200 people also rallied outside an Amazon facility in Carquefou a suburb of the western city of Nantes organisers said.

“We condemn Amazon for destroying more jobs than they create” said Sophie Jallier a spokeswoman for the organisers in Carquefou.

Other protests were reported in the eastern towns of Ensisheim and Augny.

Reacting to similar demonstrations last month Amazon said it had unwittingly become the mouthpiece of organisations that often made use of “misleading” information. It had invested 9.2 billion euros ($11.2bn) in France and was “at the origin of” the creation of 130000 jobs a spokeswoman said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlc2VydHN1bi5jb20vc3RvcnkvbGlmZS8yMDIxLzAxLzMxL2hpc3RvcnktY29ubmVjdGluZy1wYWxtLXNwcmluZ3MtdGhlLWJpZy1jaXR5LWJhbm5pbmcvNDMyNjIxMDAwMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,History: Connecting Palm Springs to 'the big city' of Banning,"Tracy Conrad

Special to The Desert Sun

Between mighty San Jacinto and towering San Gorgonio is a narrow pass traced by the San Andreas fault where the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate relentlessly thrust up the great mountains. The pass separates the coastal Mediterranean climate to the west from the desert of the Coachella Valley to the east and is the narrowest separation of the two mountain ranges.

The stricture rises from the desert floor to a broad flat bench where may be found the town of Banning. Named for Phineas Banning who was born when the United States was not even 50 years old the town features interestingly in the history of the desert.

Phineas Banning was born in 1830 in Wilmington Delaware the seventh of 11 children. At age 13 he moved to Philadelphia to work in his oldest brother’s law firm and by his late teens Banning was working on the dockyards there. Seeking his fortune and place in the world he abandoned the East Coast for the exotic destination of Southern California. Working for his passage by sea interrupted by an arduous overland crossing of the isthmus of Panama before the existence of the canal he arrived in California in 1851 as the Gold Rush was underway. Instead of heading north to mine for gold he sought his fortune working in the little fishing village of San Pedro first as a store clerk and later as a stagecoach driver on a line that connected the hamlet with the pueblo of Los Angeles.

He started his own stagecoach and shipping company naming it for his birthplace Wilmington and using the same name for a town he planted on land he purchased next to San Pedro. He began expanding the little port investing profits into creation of roads telegraphs and shipping improvements to facilitate trade. Soon Banning had stagecoach lines connecting to cities as far away as Salt Lake the Kern River gold fields and Yuma Arizona. He also owned a fleet of ocean-going ships able to move goods up and down the California coast developing a burgeoning trade for his port.

Banning was an ardent Unionist and the outbreak of the Civil War and its potential ramifications for California alarmed him. Banning donated land in Wilmington to the Union bringing troops to the newly minted Drum Barracks further developing the area and the port. The grateful American government honored Banning with the symbolic title of brigadier general.

After the war General Banning organized Southern California’s first railroad the Los Angeles & San Pedro which he sold to the Southern Pacific Railroad in 1873 cementing his fortune and the future of his beloved port. The Southern Pacific Railroad would follow the path of Banning’s stagecoach company from Los Angeles to Yuma through a little town just west of a narrow pass between great mountains; both the town and the pass would eventually be named for Banning.

As automobiles became ascendant there was ongoing debate about the best route from the East to the West by car. When the various options were still being discussed a group of car owners and businessmen began campaigning for Phineas Banning’s old stagecoach trail through the narrow pass. The Banning Route Boosters would hold rallies driving the route for fun and advocating on its behalf. The Boosters celebrated the completion of the road to Palm Springs by visiting The Desert Inn in 1918.

The following year the pavement was washed out by a flash flood and had to be almost completely reconstructed. By 1920 the ride from Los Angeles to the desert was entirely and satisfactorily paved. The road further on to Yuma wasn’t as comfortable with a long stretch of plank road which made Route 66 the preferred passage. (Route 66 would eventually be abandoned as a commercial route when air travel made the scenic highway obsolete while Banning’s is now the major artery of the 10 freeway for travel from Arizona to California.)

For the tiny village of Palm Springs the town of Banning represented civilization. It was the stagecoach stop and became the train route that formed the major corridor from Los Angeles to Yuma. And for the inhabitants of the Coachella Valley it was a big city. Until 1938 teenagers in Palm Springs were obligated to ride the bus to and from Banning after middle school as Palm Springs was too small to support a proper high school.

That Nellie Coffman the gracious proprietress of The Desert Inn decided in 1928 to buy herself a home in the foothills above Banning further cemented its importance to Palm Springs. It was cooler there in the summer but still close enough to the inn thanks to the nicely paved road. There was a new subdivision nestled up against the mountains above Banning called Lazy Acres evocative of a peaceful holiday or pleasant retirement the name conjured up the possibility of swinging in a hammock under a great shade tree. Nellie decided the name perfectly suited her lovely little house as well.

Located on Lombardy Lane it wasn’t quite two acres terraced with a variety of flowers a large lawn and surrounding wild violets and big California pepper and cottonwood trees. There was a grove of almond trees. According to Marjorie Belle Bright in her book “Nellie’s Boarding House” Lazy Acres had comfortable casual furnishings and an “air of warm hospitality” that animated everything Nellie did. Paths crisscrossed the property offering views and places to pause and ponder the plantings.

Nellie spent her summers at Lazy Acres in Banning for more than 20 years. Having come of age before the automobile was widely disseminated Nellie never learned to drive and instead trusted Segundo Rigonan her faithful employee to drive her from the desert sometimes daily tracing the 50 miles through the Banning pass celebrated by the Boosters back in 1918.

Phineas Banning’s dream of a world-class port for Los Angeles and connectivity to the rest of the country by stagecoach then railway and finally automobile was insured by the 1920s.

Again,"Two of America’s largest flight attendant unions have written an open letter to President Joe Biden pleading with him to support extending a payroll support program that has kept many airline workers in paid employment throughout the pandemic. The letter was sent on the same day that United Airlines sent federal WARN notices to 14000 employees to notify them of impending furloughs when the current bailout runs out in April.

American Airlines is also preparing to send WARN notices to its own employees in the coming days although a spokesperson for the Dallas Fort Worth-based airline has denied rumors that the letter will be posted this coming Monday.

Passenger airlines received $25 billion in payroll support funding in the first CARES Act which protected jobs through the end of September 2020. At least 32000 airline workers were furloughed without pay or healthcare benefits for several months while Congress wrangled over an extension to the Coronavirus relief bill.

The extension was eventually passed on December 28 2020 and passenger airlines received a further $15 billion to keep workers in paid employment – even if there wasn’t nearly enough work to go around because of the massive slump in passenger demand caused by the pandemic.

The problem however is that the second payroll support program was only meant to support employees through to the end of March 2021. Some airlines and lawmakers had optimistically thought that the airline industry would be heading into a full-blown recovery by the Spring but surging COVID-19 infections and the fear of vaccine-resistant variants mean any recovery might not come until much later in the year.

The Association of Flight Attendants (AFA-CWA) and the Association of Professional Flight Attendants (APFA) who together represent 75000 flight attendants including at American and United Airlines warned of “devastating” consequences if the payroll support program was not extended.

The unions have asked for a further $15 billion in financial support to keep employees in paid employment through to the end of September – or at least until the funding runs out.

The hope is that by keeping employees on full pay and up to date with training that airlines can immediately respond as soon as travel demand starts to recover. In late November 2020 American Airlines warned of a shortage of flight attendants following just a small increase in passenger flights after furloughing nearly 8000 crew.

Southwest Airlines which also took advantage of the first and second payroll support programs believes that it will not need to furlough any employees through to the end of 2021 at the earliest even if a third bailout isn’t forthcoming. Delta Air Lines has been able to avoid furloughs through a combination of voluntary leaves and early-outs.

Scott Kirby United’s chief executive has been open about the fact that the Chicago-based carrier would furlough staff again at the end of March if travel demand didn’t drastically improve. For flight attendants staffers who joined the airline has far back at September 1998 are set to be furloughed.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqQFodHRwczovL2NvbW11bml0eWltcGFjdC5jb20vaG91c3Rvbi9iZWxsYWlyZS1tZXllcmxhbmQtd2VzdC11bml2ZXJzaXR5L3BhcmtzLXJlY3JlYXRpb24vMjAyMS8wMS8zMS9ldmVseW4tcnViZW5zdGVpbi1jb21tdW5pdHktY2VudGVyLWJyZWFrcy1ncm91bmQtb24tZXhwYW5zaW9uLXByb2plY3Qv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Evelyn Rubenstein Community Center breaks ground on expansion project,"Evelyn Rubenstein Community Center breaks ground on expansion project

The company reported an adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.56 slightly above the expected $0.55.

The core of the operation

Stanley Black & Decker has cemented its place as a cornerstone in the tools and outdoor equipment industry. With renowned brands like DeWalt and Craftsman as well as its namesake marques the company thrives on innovation quality and operational excellence. Its focus has sharply turned toward optimizing supply chains reducing costs and innovating on the product front as key strategies for sustainable growth.

In the earnings release the company described consumer demand for its products in Q1 as ""muted"" and noted that volumes also fell on the infrastructure side of the business.

However the company's adept maneuvering through cost-reduction initiatives and strategic portfolio adjustments speaks to its resilience. That cost-cutting program which saved it $145 million in the quarter is expected to yield $1.5 billion in savings by the end of 2024 and $2 billion by the end of 2025.

Quarterly highlights

Despite a sales dip in its tools and outdoor segment brand strength in DeWalt partially offset sluggish demand. The smaller industrial segment faced steeper sales declines with volumes falling even as it raised prices. Meanwhile gross margin improved thanks to reduced shipping costs and inventory destocking efforts.

Looking ahead

Management's reiteration of its 2024 guidance implies confidence in the company's strategic direction with expectations of sustained operational and margin improvements. Adjusted EPS is forecast to land between $3.50 and $4.50 with free cash flow of $600 million to $800 million.

Investors are encouraged to monitor the company's progress in its global cost reduction program and its investments in innovation and growth initiatives.

Detailed financial overview and strategic insights into the company's operations and market positioning.

Expert assessment of potential challenges and growth prospects for Stanley Black & Decker Inc.

On May 2 2024 Stanley Black & Decker Inc (NYSE:SWK) filed its 10-Q report with the SEC providing a snapshot of the company's financial health and strategic direction. As a leading manufacturer of hand and power tools SWK operates primarily in two segments: Tools and Outdoor and Industrial. The company has shown resilience in a competitive market with a strong brand portfolio that includes DEWALT CRAFTSMAN and BLACK+DECKER. The financial overview from the filing reveals a year-to-date cost of sales totaling $2761.0 million a decrease from the previous year's $3096.3 million indicating improved cost management. Interest expenses have slightly increased to $131.5 million from $130.9 million. The company has also reported a net gain on cash flow hedges albeit minimal and continues to manage its defined benefit pension items with a net of tax amortization of $(2.1) million. These figures set the stage for a deeper dive into SWK's SWOT analysis providing investors with a clearer picture of the company's internal dynamics and external environment.

Decoding Stanley Black & Decker Inc (SWK): A Strategic SWOT Insight

Strengths

Brand Power: Stanley Black & Decker Inc's brand strength is a significant asset. The company's portfolio includes some of the most recognized names in the tool industry such as DEWALT CRAFTSMAN and BLACK+DECKER. These brands are synonymous with quality and reliability which has helped SWK maintain a loyal customer base and command premium pricing. The brand power is further evidenced by the company's ability to sustain revenue generation with the Tools & Outdoor segment contributing the lion's share of total revenues amounting to $13.4 billion in 2023.

Operational Efficiency: SWK's commitment to operational excellence is evident in its supply chain transformation initiatives. The company has generated approximately $145 million in pre-tax run-rate savings during the first three months of 2024 driven by lower headcount indirect spend reductions and supply chain efficiencies. This focus on cost control and operational streamlining positions SWK to improve its gross margins and enhance profitability in the long term.

Weaknesses

Market Demand Sensitivity: The company's performance is closely tied to market demand which can be volatile. In the first quarter of 2024 SWK experienced a 1% decline in volume in the Tools & Outdoor segment attributed to a muted market demand backdrop. This sensitivity to economic cycles and consumer spending patterns can lead to fluctuations in revenue and profitability making it challenging to maintain consistent growth.

Story continues

Legal and Compliance Risks: Stanley Black & Decker Inc faces ongoing legal and compliance risks as highlighted by the potential $32 million civil penalty for alleged untimely reporting related to product recalls. Additionally the company is cooperating with investigations into transactions that may raise compliance questions under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). These issues not only pose financial risks but can also impact the company's reputation and investor confidence.

Opportunities

Innovation and Product Development: SWK plans to invest between $300 million to $500 million in innovation and commercial investments through 2025 to accelerate organic growth. This strategic focus on innovation presents an opportunity to develop new products and technologies that can meet evolving customer needs and expand market share particularly in high-growth areas such as cordless and smart tools.

Geographic Expansion: With a majority of revenue derived from the United States SWK has significant opportunities to expand its international presence. The company's established brands provide a strong foundation to grow in emerging markets where demand for quality tools and outdoor equipment is increasing. Strategic partnerships and acquisitions could further facilitate international expansion and diversification of revenue streams.

Threats

Competitive Pressure: The tool industry is highly competitive with numerous players vying for market share. SWK must continuously innovate and differentiate its products to stay ahead of competitors. Price competition particularly from lower-cost manufacturers can erode margins and market position if not effectively managed.

Supply Chain Disruptions: Global supply chain challenges including material shortages and transportation bottlenecks pose a threat to SWK's ability to meet customer demand and maintain operational efficiency. While the company is undertaking a supply chain transformation it remains vulnerable to external disruptions that could impact production and delivery timelines.

In conclusion Stanley Black & Decker Inc (NYSE:SWK) demonstrates strong brand equity and operational efficiency as key strengths while facing challenges related to market demand sensitivity and legal risks. Opportunities for growth through innovation and geographic expansion are promising but the company must navigate competitive pressures and supply chain vulnerabilities. As SWK continues its strategic focus on cost reduction and product development it is well-positioned to leverage its strengths and capitalize on market opportunities despite the potential threats in its operating environment.

Here's why we bought the dip,"Stanley Black & Decker overcame a soft demand environment to deliver a top and bottom line beat Thursday but the stock is falling because the toolmaker simply reiterated its guidance. That's a fate shared by home-improvement peers and many other companies this earnings season. We added to our position on the pullback. Revenue fell 2% year over year in the January-to-March period to $3.87 billion edging out the $3.82 billion expected by analysts according to estimates compiled by LSEG. Adjusted earnings per share came in at 56 cents topping the 54-cent estimate LSEG data showed. Stanley Black & Decker Why we own it: Stanley Black & Decker is in the later innings of a multi-year restructuring plan. The company launched a series of initiatives designed to generate cost savings optimize inventory streamline and simplify the organization and transform its supply chain. Although repair and remodeling demand environment is soft due to higher interest rates management's cost-cutting plan will create a stronger company for the next cycle. As we wait for the turnaround to play out we're getting paid a hefty dividend. Competitors: Bosch Techtronic Industries and Illinois Tool Works Most recent buy: May 2 2024 Initiation: June 14 2023 Bottom Line Stanley Black & Decker turned in another solid quarter of execution on matters within management's control. It's making good on its plan of optimizing expensive inventory reducing complexities and improving its supply chain to reach $2 billion in annual cost savings by the end of 2025. The progress is evident in the results with adjusted gross margins continuing to improve. The one problem is the broader demand environment is still mostly soft preventing management from raising the midpoint of its outlook. Given the stock's lackluster year-to-date performance we would have thought investor expectations had come down enough to be satisfied with a beat and backing of guidance. However there's always someone with their expectations too high. That's pushing the stock down more than 7%. Stanley Black & Decker's professional customers remain resilient but demand from do-it-yourself customers has not returned to growth. This should be largely understood and we expect to hear similar rhetoric when Home Depot and Lowe's report their earnings later this month. We probably won't see DIY activity meaningfully rebound until mortgage rates come down and reinvigorate the existing home sales market. We focus on existing home sales because the first thing people typically do after buying an older home is spend money on repair and remodeling projects. This dynamic makes Stanley Black & Decker one of the more interest-rate-sensitive stocks we have in the portfolio. We don't want to have too many of them in this ""higher for longer"" environment but at least with Stanley Black & Decker our patience is being rewarded with hefty dividend yield of about 3.80%. The thesis may be taking longer to play out but what management is doing to take out costs in the soft environment will make its earnings power look more impressive once the cycle turns. We are lowering our price target to $105 from $110 because rate cut expectations keep getting pushed out extending the timing of the DIY market recovery. But we are reiterating our 1 rating and bought this pullback earlier Thursday. Quarterly commentary Stanley Black & Decker's largest segment by far — known as Tools & Outdoor — generated sales of $3.29 billion in the quarter topping the $3.27 billion expected by analysts according to FactSet. However operating income of $279 million slightly missed analyst projections of $286 million per FactSet. Volume growth of 1% in the company's flagship DeWalt power tools could not overcome a muted consumer and a soft do-it-yourself environment which pressured sales for hand tools. Outdoor organic revenue was up 2% in the quarter mostly driven by demand for handheld cordless outdoor power equipment. Pricing was flat which we think is a positive because it shows the company isn't cutting prices to spur demand. Once you give up price in this business it's very hard to get it back. Sales in Stanley Black & Decker's smaller Industrial segment— largely made up of fasteners in end markets such as automotive and aerospace — totaled $585 million in the period missing the $596 million estimate according to FactSet. Quarterly operating income in the segment of $71 million topped estimates at $63 million according to FactSet. Organic sales fell 4% partially offset by a 1% price increase across the segment. Within the segment its so-called Engineered Fastening business saw organic revenues grow 5% thanks to a 30% increase in aerospace and a 4% increase in automotive. As a reminder Stanley completed the divestiture of its Infrastructure business on April 1 for $760 million in cash. Net proceeds from the sale were used to reduce short-term debt in the second quarter. The company's adjusted gross margin performance of 29.0% was a solid mark improving 590 basis points compared with last year and exceeding expectations of 28.7%. The result keeps the business on track to achieve its goal of about 30% over the full year. The gross margin improvements were driven by lower inventory destocking costs supply chain transformation benefits and reduced shipping costs. Free cash flow was negative which is typical with first-quarter seasonality. However the result was a little better than expected due to inventory control. The company's capital deployment priorities this year are to invest in organic growth fund the dividend and strengthen the balance sheet. Stanley Black & Decker has been paying a dividend for 147 consecutive years with increases in each of the past 56. Guidance Management made no real changes to its 2024 guidance. It still expects total company organic sales to be relatively unchanged plus or minus low single digits. At the segment level organic sales in Tools & Outdoor are projected to be relatively flat at the midpoint while Industrial is expected to be relatively flat to slightly positive. Margins at Tools & Outdoors are expected to improve year over year while Industrial is expected to remain flat. Management continues to expect adjusted EPS to be between $3.50 to $4.50. Considering the stock sell-off Wall Street must have been looking for some signaling that earnings were trending toward the higher end of the range based on the consensus forecast of $4.14. This was way too optimistic. This modeling came well before the market erased its expectations for multiple interest rate cuts this year. While Stanley's wide earnings range leaves us ambiguity into the rest of the year CFO Patrick Hallinan said he believes the midpoint of the range can be achieved due to costs controls. Meanwhile management reiterated its full-year adjusted free cash flow of $600 million and $800 million. In addition the company expects gross margins to increase sequentially in both halves of 2024 and total 30% for the full year. Gross margins are expected to be in the low 30s exiting the year setting up 2025 for another year of strong year-over-year earnings expansion even if the demand environment stays tepid. The company's long-term adjusted gross margin target of 35% is supported by the $2 billion in annual cost savings it expects by the end of next year. ""We remain confident that our transformation can support the sustainable cost structure and efficiency needed to return our adjusted gross margin to 35% or greater while enabling targeted growth investments"" Hallinan said.

By Molly Ryan

While some put their faith in astrology to figure out everything you need to know about a person I will just ask you what your Starbucks order is.

Being a barista and Starbucks “partner” (as the company calls its employees) for around a year and a half now it’s simple to say that I have had my fair share of experience in the mystical world of five-dollar coffee.

So this week I decided to do the honors of presenting The Crow’s Nest’s Starbucks staff picks.

Sophie’s Order: Caramel Macchiato

This uniquely Starbucks drink is a classic.

Ordered hot to Sophie’s preference the caramel macchiato consists of vanilla syrup (with one less pump than a typical latte) steamed milk espresso poured on top and caramel drizzle.

The catch about this drink is that it is nowhere related or even close to a traditional espresso macchiato. The traditional macchiato is simply just espresso with a dollop of foam on top. Order a caramel macchiato anywhere but a large chain you will get something far different from the expected sweet drink.

From ordering the staff Starbucks on multiple occasions I know that Sophie gets this drink in a venti with two extra pumps of classic syrup for added sweetness.

Aya’s Order: Cold Brew

Cold brew will never not be one of the most served drinks on the menu.

We steep our cold brew for 20 hours giving it much more intensity and caffeine concentration than the regular iced coffee that gets brewed every morning.

An extremely versatile pick you can customize and flavor your cold brew however to your liking. If Aya is feeling a little crazy she’ll add some almond milk in there – but most of the time she just drinks it black.

While the intense taste just isn’t for me I think all of the hype it gets is completely justified.

Anna’s Order: Cinnamon Almond Milk Cold Brew

This is the newest drink that Starbucks has to offer on this list. Launching last June it was an immediate hit for those who prefer non-dairy beverages.

A twist on a normal Starbucks cold brew this beverage is topped with almond milk foam containing cinnamon powder and a pump of vanilla syrup for added sweetness.

I tend to shy away from cold brew but this drink was a very pleasant surprise.

Trevor’s Order: Nitro Cold Brew

Not just any cold brew: it’s nitro cold brew.

This is probably the most intense drink Starbucks offers so it’s no surprise that this is Trevor’s drink of choice.

For those unfamiliar nitro cold brew is infused with nitrogen gas; this not only gives it a thicker consistency than normal cold brew but the nitrogen allows the caffeine to enter the bloodstream at a quicker rate than normal.

In fact the largest size Starbucks offers this beverage is a grande as any other size would be too much caffeine for typical consumption.

This drink is also by far the easiest drink to make. Because adding ice would kill the smooth texture of the drink literally all you have to do is pull down the tap and make sure it doesn’t overflow; so big thanks to all of the nitro lovers.

Darnell’s Order: Dirty Chai

This drink is an all-around coffee shop classic.

While the name sounds a bit elusive all a dirty chai is is a chai tea latte with a shot of espresso.

Adding an additional kick of caffeine the espresso also helps to balance out the spicy-sweet flavor of chai with a subtle hint of bitterness.

Chai is definitely not for everyone but its bold and unique character cannot be matched by any other.

Catherine’s Order: Butterbeer Frap

First things first this drink and I cannot emphasize this enough is not on the menu. The Starbucks secret menu is not a real thing. It’s totally fine to order these drinks but please make sure you order the exact recipe as opposed to just saying the name of the secret menu item because I can almost promise the barista at the register has no idea what goes in the “strawberry cheesecake” Frappuccino.

The butterbeer Frappuccino is pretty simple to order. For those of you unfamiliar with the world of Harry Potter butterbeer is a sweet and creamy drink served both in the fictional series and at Universal’s “Wizarding World of Harry Potter” in Orlando. The drink is a crème based (that’s Starbucks language for “contains no coffee”) Frappuccino with caramel and toffee nut syrup caramel drizzle inside the cup and on top of the whipped cream.

I’ll admit this was extremely tasty. The toffee nut and caramel combo gives it just the right amount of sweet with a hint of salt and the caramel drizzle inside the cup is extremely satisfying to look at. While it may be kind of an obscure drink it’s fairly easy to make. Keep an eye out for when smoked butterscotch comes back to the Starbucks repertoire because in my opinion I think it’s a little closer to the actual taste of the drink they serve at Universal.

But overall good choice Catherine.

Edyn’s Order: Iced Mocha Latte

Whether it be a latte a Frappuccino or the dark cocoa almond milk foam cold brew: I don’t think I will ever go a shift without using good old mocha sauce.

A consistent fan favorite the iced mocha latte comes with mocha sauce espresso ice milk and is topped with whipped cream and mocha drizzle.

Iced or hot this drink is perfect for settling both a sweetness and caffeine craving.

Molly’s Order: Iced Matcha Latte

While the pumpkin spice and the chestnut praline lattes were some strong contenders I have to go with my ride or die on this one.

Matcha is another one of those things that most people either love or hate. It honestly took some getting used to the first time I had it but I soon learned to love the earthy yet sweet taste of the drink.

Not too heavily caffeinated the green tea derivative is a perfect little pick-me-up when trying to avoid the intense rush of coffee or espresso beverages.

In my humble barista opinion almond milk is the best choice to go with matcha as it accentuates the earthy flavor in the tastiest way.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay9uZXdzL2FydGljbGUtOTIwNDgwOS9Sb2Jpbmhvb2QtcmVzdHJpY3RzLXRyYWRpbmctRklGVFktc3RvY2tzLWluY2x1ZGluZy1TdGFyYnVja3MtR00uaHRtbNIBeWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay9uZXdzL2FydGljbGUtOTIwNDgwOS9hbXAvUm9iaW5ob29kLXJlc3RyaWN0cy10cmFkaW5nLUZJRlRZLXN0b2Nrcy1pbmNsdWRpbmctU3RhcmJ1Y2tzLUdNLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Robinhood restricts trading on FIFTY stocks including Starbucks and GM,"Robinhood restricted the purchase of 50 different stocks late on Friday including blue-chip names Starbucks and General Motors in an apparent act of desperation as the company's cash reserves were stretched to the limit.

The move followed a wild week of trading driven by small investors on the message board Reddit who took on hedge funds that had bet against shares of struggling video game retailer GameStop.

Robinhood said in a statement that it had restricted users from purchasing certain shares this week because it struggled to meet deposit requirements with the clearinghouses behind the scenes of stock trading.

It was a stunning admission that cast doubt on conspiracy theories accusing Robinhood of trying to tank high-flying GameStop shares for nefarious purposes -- but it revealed how precarious the startup trading platform's financial position may be.

Robinhood's trading restrictions -- which limited little investors even as big hedge funds were free to buy and sell stock at will -- drew fury from elected leaders in both parties and scrutiny from regulators.

Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev said that no outside pressure was put on the company to restrict trading. Now the company reveals it was cash-strapped with the main clearinghouse

Meanwhile billionaire bond fund manager Jeffrey Gundlach is blaming federal stimulus checks for fueling the 'meme stock' frenzy which saw GameStop shares skyrocket 1800 percent in January as small traders attempted to bankrupt hedge funds that had bet against it.

'I think wherewithal from governmental stimulus ultimately is really the cause' Gundlach founder of the $148 billion bond fund DoubleLine Capital told Fox Business on Friday.

Gundlach said that two rounds of individual stimulus checks or 'stimmies' as the funds are known on Reddit had allowed an army of small traders to 'pile drive' hedge funds by buying up stocks that were heavily short sold.

The trading frenzy came to a head on Wednesday when GameStop shares shot up 135 percent in a single day inflicting billions of dollars of potential losses on prominent hedge funds.

On Thursday Robinhood began banning the purchase of stock in GameStop and several other companies that had been touted on Reddit.

The free trading app is wildly popular with members of the Reddit forum WallStreetBets where the insurgency began and the Robinhood's move drew harsh criticism from users as well as politicians across the ideological spectrum.

Billionaire bond fund manager Jeffrey Gundlach is blaming federal stimulus checks for fueling the 'meme stock' frenzy which saw GameStop shares skyrocket 1800 percent in January

GameStop stock rose another 67% on Friday continuing a staggering rally

On Friday Robinhood lifted the buying ban but limited the number of shares each user could increase their position to. For example users were allowed to buy a maximum of one share of GameStop if they didn't already own more.

Robinhood said the buying restrictions were a result of its struggle to meet deposit requirements at clearing houses which it said increased ten-fold this week.

'It was not because we wanted to stop people from buying these stocks' Robinhood said in a blog post.

'We did this because the required amount we had to deposit with the clearinghouse was so large - with individual volatile securities accounting for hundreds of millions of dollars in deposit requirements - that we had to take steps to limit buying in those volatile securities to ensure we could comfortably meet our requirements' the company said.

The statement shed light on the drama behind the scenes between Robinhood and the little-know Depository Trust and Clearing Company which operates as the single clearinghouse through which all public stock trades are executed in the U.S.

The DTCC is the institution that actually performs the exchange of stocks for cash where securities are deposited for safekeeping as trades are being executed enabling the instant buying and selling of stock even though the actual settlement of the trades takes a day or more.

Brokerages have to post money with the DTCC to cover trades while they wait for their customer's trades to settle.

Normally those deposit requirements are manageable because brokers have customers both buying and selling the same stocks so if the broker fails their book with the DTCC balances out.

But the situation this week at Robinhood was anything but normal with massive numbers of users buying up GameStop shares and very few selling. At one point an estimated half of Robinhood's 13 million users owned some GameStop stock.

The lopsided trading caused Robinhood's deposit requirements with the DTCC to skyrocket tenfold the company said.

A spokesman for the DTCC wouldn’t specify how much it required from specific firms but told Bloomberg that by the end of Friday industrywide collateral requirements had jumped to $33.5 billion up from $26 billion.

The cash requirements stretched Robinhood to the limit even after it tapped investors for an emergency $1 billion fundraising round and reportedly tapped credit lines for another $600 million.

On Friday Robinhood's list of restricted stocks had reached 50 different stocks including General Motors Beyond Meat and Starbucks

As trading continued on Friday Robinhood dramatically expanded the list of stocks on which it placed purchase limits.

By around 5pm during extended trading hours the list had reached 50 different stocks including General Motors Beyond Meat and Starbucks.

Vaccine makers Moderna and NovaVax were also on the list. A Robinhood spokeswoman declined to confirm to DailyMail.com that the same stocks would be restricted on Monday saying only that the company would 'continue to monitor the situation and make adjustments as needed.'

The restrictions extended far beyond the 'meme stocks' such as GameStop that drew frenzied interest this week and indicate the precarious financial position that Robinhood could be in.

Robinhood insists that the restrictions are only temporary. 'Our goal is to enable purchasing for all securities on our platform' the company said.

'This is a dynamic volatile market and we have and may continue to take action to make sure we meet our requirements as a broker so we can continue to serve our customers for the long term' Robinhood added.

Robinhood was not the only trading platform to implement trading restrictions. TD Ameritrade also had restrictions on buying shares in 19 companies most of them with heavily shorted stock.

Meanwhile Robinhood which is based in California is looking for office space in Manhattan according to the Real Deal.

The company has expanded ambitiously as its user base exploded during the pandemic with 3 million signing up in the first six months of 2020.

Robinhood had been rumored to be eyeing an initial public offering of its own stock but it was unclear what impact the fallout of this week might have on those plans.

'Rest assured our position remains firm' the company said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvdGhlcmVzLXN0YXJidWNrcy1zZWNyZXQtdmFsZW50aW5lcy1kYXktMjI1MjAwODA4Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,There's A Starbucks Secret Valentine's Day Frappuccino Menu,"From Country Living

It may be freezing cold outside but is it ever really too cold for a Frappuccino? That's especially true if you're single on Valentine's Day and need some sugar and caffeine to accompany your rom-com binge.

For all you singletons (and coffee-addicted couples) out there Starbucks is here for you. Tony Aguilar who works at a licensed Starbucks in a Tucson AZ grocery store came up with a few Valentine's Day drinks to go with their themed merchandise. They handed out their creations in samples and they quickly became a hit with customers ordering the drinks by name in the store. ""I was actually surprised with how popular they became"" Aguilar says.

Aguilar posted his store's formulations on Reddit and they look seriously tasty:

According to a Starbucks spokesperson there are more than 36000 ways you can customize a Frappuccino when you factor in ingredients like milks syrups and toppings. But don't walk in and ask for the Valentine Frappuccino since chances are your barista may not know how to make it. ""If customers would like to order a beverage that is not listed on our menu we recommend they know the recipe so that their barista can handcraft the beverage perfectly for them"" the spokesperson said.

If you felt like a new fried chicken sandwich debuted every day in January you’re not far off.

Some chains tried their best to slim down while others did the exact opposite. The flurry of chicken sandwich additions are notable because several chains have eliminated a number of items over the past year to shed complexity and costs.

However with a new year kicking off and sales on the rise once again restaurants are doing all they can to sustain the growth after a bleak 2020.

Here’s what’s making their nationwide debuts on menus everywhere:

Boston Market

As if there weren’t enough options for a basic fried chicken sandwich Boston Market is here to up the ante.

The Nashville Hot Crispy Chicken Sandwich is now being sold for a limited time with a confident company saying that the “chicken sandwich wars are over.” It gets its spiciness from a hot sauce that “perfectly blends cayenne pepper and chili powder with sugar garlic and a handful of secret spices.”

Chick-fil-A

The creator of the fried chicken sandwich is changing things up with a grilled version. The Grilled Spicy Chicken Deluxe Sandwich is its first new chicken sandwich in nearly two years and has its own specially created Cilantro Lime Sauce.

“We know guests are looking to add more variety to their meals especially after a year where new food experiences were limited” said Leslie Neslage director of menu and packaging at Chick-fil-A in an acknowledgment that last year’s start of the pandemic complicated menu debuts.

Chipotle

Chipotle (CMG) added cauliflower rice to its menu as customers’ tastes keep shifting toward healthier options including low-carb or more plant-based alternatives. The rice alternative which costs $2 extra was tested last summer before making its nationwide debut earlier this month.

Starbucks

Despite the frigid temperatures cold drinks continue to be a success for the coffee chain. Starbucks (SBUX) said sales of the icy concoctions have grown 45% over the past four years which has prompted it to unveil another cold drink.

This month the Honey Almondmilk Cold Brew was added to menus – a new drink that also capitalizes on the growth of non-dairy milks.

Pizza Hut

Pizza Hut's new Detroit-style pizza is now available. Pizza Hut

The pizza chain added two new items this month: A crusty ring of cheese-stuffed dough called the Nothing But Stuffed Crust and a Detroit-style pizza.

Competition among big chains has been fierce during the pandemic which has fueled a surge in pizza demand from Americans who are spending more time at home and avoiding dine-in restaurants. Pizza Hut hopes the new menu items sustain last year’s growth a trend that’s likely to continue.

“What we saw in 2020 was that many of these pizza delivery guys had a big boom in their sales because there was nowhere else to go” Peter Saleh a restaurant analyst with research firm BTIG previously told CNN Business. He predicts pizza sales will remain healthy in 2021 as the “environment for dining continues to be challenged.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vYnJhbmRlcXVpdHkuZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FkdmVydGlzaW5nL3N0YXJidWNrcy1jZWxlYnJhdGVzLWh1bWFuLWNvbm5lY3Rpb25zLWluLW5ldy1maWxtLzgwNjA0NDU30gGBAWh0dHBzOi8vYnJhbmRlcXVpdHkuZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy9hZHZlcnRpc2luZy9zdGFyYnVja3MtY2VsZWJyYXRlcy1odW1hbi1jb25uZWN0aW9ucy1pbi1uZXctZmlsbS84MDYwNDQ1Nw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Starbucks celebrates human connections in new film,"Advertising

Jenny Haines director of planning and development for the city told the Auburn City Council Thursday night that construction on the lot at 1-7 State St. was set to go to bid Friday.

Haines said the current target date for project completion is Nov. 12 in time for the yearly holiday parade which is normally held on Thanksgiving weekend. She added that the city is currently looking at a construction time frame of four to five months.

In an interview Friday Haines said the bidding period is set to end Fed. 24. The construction starting date will depend on the bids in case the city needs to snag extra funding.

Auburn has secured $1 million for the project through the state Downtown Revitalization Initiative in which New York is providing $10 million in funding to various projects within downtown. If more money for the plaza is necessary Haines said the city will pursue other funding sources such as donations from local foundations or bond financing.

The city government has been trying to do something with the site for more than 25 years. The site of the former Kalet's Department Store it became city property due to tax foreclosure in 1995. The store building was demolished in 2011 to allow for a proposed theater project but that was canceled in 2014 amid a series of legal challenges from Joseph Camardo a neighboring property owner.

When officials were exploring development proposals for the area after the theater project was canceled Camardo proposed acquiring the land and making it a parking lot. The city ultimately opted to turn in into an outdoor public park where events could be held. That project was opposed by Camardo who argued the property had environmental issues that hadn't been properly addressed by the city.

But in September City Manager Jeff Dygert said that officials have had an ongoing dialogue with Camardo and the other property owners with land adjacent to the site. At an Oct. 1 meeting city council approved a resolution to transfer a 15-by-15 foot piece of the land to James Driscoll who owns property immediately south of the parcel so he ""can have fire prevention access to his building which would in turn enable him access to use the 2nd and 3rd floors of the building"" according to a council resolution.

Officials noted in September that transfers of other portions of the 1-7 State St. site were expected to come in front of the council for future agendas.

Conversations with adjacent property owners are still ongoing as the bid process moves forward Haines said on Friday.

1-7 State St. The empty lot at 1-7 State St. Auburn may be redeveloped as a public park.

""We are having good and fruitful discussions with those adjacent property owners and would expect those agreements to be in place at the appropriate time"" she said.

Pieces of lands are being set aside for those property owners in the bid documents Haines continued.

At Thursday's meeting Mayor Mike Quill said he hoped the work would be done by local bidders and asked that the city ""do everything we can to notify them that it is going out to bid or it has gone out to bid."" Haines said the bid will be on the city's website but Auburn will also reach out to local contractors ""who do this kind of work.""

City councilors Jimmy Giannettino and Debby McCormick said they were excited about the project and Haines expressed anticipation about this endeavor getting underway after years of ideas proposals and discussions on how to handle the property.

""This is another one of those full career projects for me; 1995 was when the city took (the property) for taxes. That was two years after I started here and so we've been having fun with it ever since"" she said with a laugh.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vc3RwZXRlY2F0YWx5c3QuY29tL3N0YXRlLXBlbnNpb24tZnVuZC1kb3VibGVzLWRvd24tb24tcGluZWxsYXMtY291bnR5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,State pension fund doubles down on Pinellas County,"The Florida Growth Fund Program likes what it sees in Pinellas County’s rapidly diversifying economy. According to a report issued by the state’s Office of Program Policy Analysis and Government Accountability (OPPAGA) the fund more than doubled its investments in Pinellas County companies between fiscal year 2018-19 and fiscal year 2019-20 increasing its stake from $15.2 million to $32.8 million.

Established in 2008 the Florida Growth Fund Program is a mechanism for the State Board of Administration (SBA) to invest up to 1.5 percent of Florida Retirement System Pension Fund (FRS) assets in technology and growth companies that are based or have a significant presence in Florida.

“It’s the SBA trying to maximize their return on investment” said Mike Meidel director of Pinellas County Economic Development in an interview with the Catalyst. “The beauty of Pinellas is we are diversifying our economy. And we have more opportunities in these industry sectors than we’ve ever had before — it just continues to grow.”

The spike in investment dollars is no fluke or anomaly Meidel added. It coincides with other positive economic trends in the county particularly the rising number of people employed in technology professional services and financial services. Also he said IRS data shows migration trending in the right direction.

“The people who are leaving Pinellas County have lower incomes than those who are arriving” he said. “We’re gaining net worth from the people who are moving here.”

Indeed according to IRS data from 2017-18 the most recent set available the adjusted gross income of the population outflow was $1.5 billion while AGI of the inflow was $2.32 billion.

“Success begets success” Meidel said. “When people see companies moving here or they hear about somebody down the street who just decided to move to Florida you start looking at it yourself then you find out there’s no state income tax … that’s a big driver right now with so many states trying to expand revenues by taxing wealthy individuals. And so they flee for areas that have good quality of life but also don’t take away their income. And then in our case they buy expensive properties and improve them. And that improves our tax base which is our property tax base.”

In essence the Florida Growth Fund Program’s increasing bullishness toward Pinellas is a reflection of the virtuous cycle that Meidel described. Even amid a pandemic he said “Everything is firing on the right cylinders right now. We just haven’t seen as big a downturn as some other areas.”

Other Tampa Bay counties either retained their same amount of Florida Growth Fund Program investment or increased slightly from 2019 to 2020. Manatee County held steady at $6.8 million as did Sarasota County at $13 million. Investment in Hillsborough County companies meanwhile rose from $122.1 million in 2019 to $135.6 million in 2020.

In case you’re wondering Palm Beach County receives the most investment from the Florida Growth Fund Program at $208.8 million. That’s up from $177.5 million in 2019.

According to the OPPAGA report as of June 30 2020 the program has made commitments to invest $827.2 million in 62 technology and growth companies and 43 private equity funds. The returns on those investments have resulted in a distribution of $540.1 million to the Florida Retirement System Trust Fund.

And the benefits don’t just extend to retirees. According to the OPPAGA report companies receiving program investments reported creating 19794 Florida jobs as of June 30. Fund managers reported that current investments that created jobs paid median annual wages ranging from $17000 to $121098 with the majority of median wages exceeding the state’s 2019 overall median wage of $35838.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL2JhbHRpbW9yZS9uZXdzL2JheHRlci1zY29yZXMtMjgtdG8tbGlmdC1tb3JnYW4tc3QtcGFzdC1jb3BwaW4tc3QtNzktNzYv0gFjaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2JzbmV3cy5jb20vYW1wL2JhbHRpbW9yZS9uZXdzL2JheHRlci1zY29yZXMtMjgtdG8tbGlmdC1tb3JnYW4tc3QtcGFzdC1jb3BwaW4tc3QtNzktNzYv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Baxter Scores 28 To Lift Morgan St. Past Coppin St. 79-76,"BALTIMORE (AP) — Troy Baxter scored a season-high 28 points and Morgan State edged Coppin State 79-76 on Saturday.

St. Augustine Record USA TODAY NETWORK

Editor's Note: The following article was first published on Dec. 24 2012 as part of The Record's ""Where History Lives"" series where we give readers a glimpse of the area's storied past.

On Feb. 2 1951 St. Augustine residents turned out to play in the snow.

Visions of Valentine’s Day cards were replaced by snowballs snowmen and sledding.

According to the U.S. Weather Service 2 inches of snow fell on St. Augustine and it stayed cold enough long enough for people to pull out the heavy winter gear and get out in the white stuff. For some transplants it must have awakened a bit of maybe-not-so-welcome nostalgia. For natives and children it was a once-in-a-lifetime experience. The last snow had fallen in 1917.

As far south as Tampa Bay the state got a dusting of the white stuff but according to The St. Augustine Record people “motored from surrounding towns” to see the 2 inches of snow that covered the Oldest City. Other Florida cities had snow flurries and sleet but those quickly melted. Not so in St. Augustine.

“It was a winter novelty of course but the real McCoy. For four hours beginning on Friday night around 9:30 o’clock the snow came fluttering down until St. Augustine and the countryside were transformed into a wonderland of gleaming white” wrote The Record’s Harvey Lopez.

“At least 2 inches of snow fell during the odd wintry trick; it piled up in yards on rooftops covered automobiles and turned trees into a fairyland.”

All of St. Johns County was blanketed The Record noted and “Elkton and Hastings reported a snowfall comparable to this city’s.”

Up go the snowmen

One of the first snowmen went up in front of the City Building put together by local firemen and policemen. A photo captured fireman B.M. Hall Jr. fireman J.V. Davis policeman James Grisson and fireman Herbert Capo standing by their creation. Soon snowmen started going up everywhere as children and adults got in the spirit. The St. Augustine Historical Society has a photograph of two of the Sisters of St. Joseph constructing a snowman downtown.

A front-page picture featured children armed with snowballs on Friday evening ready to throw them at passersby. “Practically every person in St. Augustine threw at least one snowball after Friday night’s Florida oddity” the caption claimed.

“Citizens rode or walked around the streets amazed by the snowy wonderland seen on every side” wrote The Record. “Tourists merely shook their heads some in disgust. But to this oldest city it was an event that happens once in a generation.”

The snow started and stayed through the next day along with cold temperatures. The Fort Green hill at Castillo de San Marcos was filled with adults and children giving sledding a try. Stuart Bridle of Charlotte Street whose family had recently moved from Free Point Ill. was photographed using the sled he had brought with him. Other people used what they could find to take a ride down the hill.

Last snowfall in 1917

The last time snow had stayed in St. Augustine was Jan. 30 1917 when half an inch covered the ground. The newspaper then reported one child urging his mother to “come and see all the grits all over the roofs and ground.” That snow was also a novelty for many of the older residents “who have never wintered north” The Record said.

In 1917 the mercury dropped to a reported 20 degrees. That had residents and farmers concerned about possible damage although The Record reported “vegetables in the city gardens look as if they had been laundered and hung out to dry.”

Growers had greater concerns since the area still contained numerous citrus groves but the hope was some of the hardiest varieties would recover.

A hard time for farmers

The 1951 snow combined with a spat of cold weather caused lots more concern to farmers and cattlemen throughout the state. Florida was still heavily agricultural and crops paid the bills. The cattle industry took a particularly hard hit with thousands of cattle killed by the combination of cold rain and extremely cold winds.

The Record reported the weather had “wiped out the county’s tender cabbage crop and other produce. It is feared that citrus in the county is also hurt.”

Weather officials said a mass of dry air over the state contributed to the snow conditions. The temperature dropped into the teens in parts of North Florida.

Predictions were the cold wave gripping Florida would get worse early Sunday. “A hard night is ahead for citrus truck crops and the rich cattle industry” reported the Record.

The Associated Press reported heavy winds sleet and snow as far south as Tampa Bay. “The weather was so bad and the air lanes so crowded in the key area that six big commercial airliners had to sit down at Key West” according to AP.

A cause for bragging

But in St. Augustine people were taking a break from worries by playing in the snow under bright sun.

They even took the time to do a little bragging. News organizations wanted photographs of the phenomenon and the Chamber of Commerce and Record photographers obliged. Berniece McCarter from the Chamber staff drove the photos up to Jacksonville where they were placed on wire photo machinery and sent to big city papers that had the capacity to receive them. For other papers the AP made mat pads with photo engravings and airmailed them.

The Record got calls for photos from papers as far south as Miami and as far north as Toronto.

They got 200 calls alone from people wanting a Record photographer to come take a picture of “the best snowman in town.”

Lopez reported The Record regretted photographers could not get everywhere but because of limited time in order to beat their morning deadline many “shots the Record needed had already been taken before most of its subscribers had breakfast.”

The St. Augustine National Bank in a quick turnaround used the weather phenomenon in an ad in the Sunday paper. Against a drawing featuring snow the bank declared: “Since the Last Snow Fall in St. Augustine assets have grown over $9984000.”

The Sunday paper told readers: “The weatherman promised even colder weather for today but St. Augustinians are used to anything now.”

It would be January of 1977 before St. Augustine would see snow come to stay again.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS90ZWNoL2dhbWVzdG9wLWJ1YmJsZS1pc24tdC1yZXZvbHQtMDkwMDQ1MzQwLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The GameStop bubble isn't a revolt against Wall Street,"A statue of a girl facing the Wall St. Bull is seen as part of a campaign by U.S. fund manager State Street.

The GameStop short squeeze has been described as a revolt against financial capitalism or the realization of Occupy Wall Street. This is like calling the movie Air Bud a critique of basketball because a golden retriever proved surprisingly good at the game.

That an investing influencer under the moniker DeepFuckingValue collaborated with like-minded speculators on Reddit forums to identify an arbitrage and put the squeeze on ostensibly sophisticated hedge funds is nothing short of impressive—and a testament to the accessibility of the markets. Some big players saw real losses but so far the markets have not crashed and the financial industry is not shook.

Indeed some of the biggest profiteers from this week’s market action are asset managers like BlackRock market-makers like Citadel and the private equity giant Silver Lake. Other big investors quickly followed Robinhood users into the GameStop trade along with many new small-time day traders. How all these various players exit the trade—and whether they do so at a profit—will shape whatever response regulators may offer to the situation.

After some brokerages suspended trading in GameStop and other hot stocks conspiracy theories quickly spread that “suits” intervened to keep small investors from playing the market. Some populist politicians joined the conspiratorial social media pile-on. The more prosaic reality is that online brokers swamped in new business had to raise money to meet capital requirements imposed by regulators to protect investors of all stripes.

Populism this ain’t. Occupy Wall Street did not speak with a single voice but after the 2008 financial crisis the “99%” were clearly fed up with speculation. Some of demands that emerged from that movement included universal basic income debt relief—and a financial transactions tax to curb short-term investing. A decade later is the dream really unfettered access to leveraged options trades?

Make no mistake: The “suits” would love to see that pivot—some call it neoliberalism.

About 30 people gathered at the intersection of Port Access Road and what is now Henry Weiss Boulevard in honor of the first president of the Lowndes County Port Authority Board. Columbus City Council approved the renaming of the road at its Jan. 19 meeting.

“Henry took his job as president and a member of the board very seriously” said Harper a longtime friend of the Weiss family. “He understood it he could talk it and he enjoyed what he was doing never looking or expecting or wanting any recognition or any personal credit for what he did.”

Weiss 90 served on the board for about 18 years and played a major role in establishing the port as a commerce and transportation hub along the banks of the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway. His family drove him to the dedication site Friday morning where he was surprised to find a small crowd and a new road sign on the street corner.

He received a second road sign which the city of Columbus paid for to keep for himself.

Port Director Will Sanders approached the city and county with the idea to rename the road after Weiss.

“He was really instrumental in the creation of our port and he also went after funding and legislation (to support it) so this is like his little baby” Sanders said.

Weiss’ business legacy in Columbus

Weiss grew up in Clarksdale and moved to Columbus in 1956 specifically to start a scrap material recycling company on The Island Weiss’ son-in-law Gregg Rader said. United Technologies Corporation was establishing itself in the region building small electric motors via its American Bosch brand and Weiss saw the business opportunity there.

Rader and his wife Weiss’ daughter Welissa became the owners of Columbus Scrap Material in 1996. Rader is now retired as CEO.

Columbus Scrap has grown to include 12 scrap yards in four states. The company recycles any and all metals including aluminum brass copper nickel tin and zinc. The metal comes from a range of things including street signs car wheels radiators barrels computers soft drink cans and wire. Roughly 85 percent of the metal comes from industrial manufacturers that Columbus Scrap Material sells to foundries steel mills and specialty mills.

The Lowndes County Port was commissioned in the 1970s construction began in 1985 and it opened for business in 1987. A group of advocates for the port including Weiss and Harper traveled to Washington D.C. to meet with U.S. Sen. John Stennis a Mississippi Democrat to discuss the possibility of federal funding for the port.

They managed to secure a meeting with the senator himself not with a member of his staff in his office Harper said.

“He asked a few questions which I think were answered to his satisfaction about the port and the plans and so forth and he said ‘Boys y’all go on back to Mississippi. I won’t consider the Tenn-Tom Waterway complete until there’s a port in Columbus'” Harper said. “And he stood by his word and he delivered.”

The port has since grown from one building on the east side of The Island to another location on the west bank of the river. Businesses including Kinder Morgan Southern Ionics and Steel Dynamics transport and receive materials via the port.

Baldor Electric would have left Columbus entirely if the company hadn’t been able to relocate to the port District 1 Supervisor Harry Sanders told The Dispatch.

“We talked them into staying here and they built that building there (on Port Access Road)” he said.

‘Can’t put it into words’

MSU football legend Art Davis was a lifelong friend of Weiss having grown up with him in Clarksdale.

“He said Henry was the smartest person he had ever known when it came to dealing with numbers and figures” Harper said. “He said he was especially smart when those numbers had dollar signs in front of them.”

The audience laughed.

“He also said Henry never needed an adding machine or a calculator to get what he was looking for” Harper continued. “He could figure it out in his head a lot quicker than he could with a machine. Art went on to say he never could understand why Henry had such a hard time with high school algebra. The only thing he could imagine was that those numbers didn’t have dollar signs in front of them.”

Mayor Robert Smith who served on the port authority board when Weiss was president said Friday was “a great day for the city.”

“This was an honor that is well-achieved” Smith said.

Weiss himself was floored by the recognition he told The Dispatch.

“I can’t put it into words” he said. “It’s an honor.”

Justin Sullivan | Getty Images

Every time someone accesses the internet through their smartphone their wireless carrier transmits that data through the airwaves on frequencies that only it has the license to use. In the coming weeks licenses to use some of of the most valuable frequencies will be assigned to the highest bidder. Whoever wins will almost certainly use them to build out a faster more powerful 5G network changing the competitive dynamics of the telecom industry. Earlier this month the Federal Communications Commission announced that bidders have bid $80.9 billion on 280 megahertz of airwave licenses or spectrum in what's referred to as Auction 107. After 97 rounds of bidding the total was significantly higher than the $20 billion to $30 billion range most outside observers predicted last summer and underscores how critical this auction is for telecom companies. ""Once these 5G networks deployed on this mid-band spectrum are rolled out the performance jump is going to be so dramatic that if carriers are not in that game they're going to get left behind"" said Doug Brake broadband policy director at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation a think tank. The winners of the auction aren't public yet. Verizon AT&T T-Mobile and other parties involved in the auction are in a quiet period where they can't comment until it's final and down payments have been paid. A notice issued by the FCC on Jan. 26 reminded applicants that they can't legally talk about any non-public information such as who's won or lost. The FCC also said the auction is entering a second phase in which the winners will get to pick the exact regions and blocks of spectrum they want. The bidders have won licenses but the specific assignments aren't final yet. The results are expected to be released in a few weeks.

Who's buying

SOPA Images

The auction is a big deal for Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T the big three U.S. wireless companies. All three are in the process of building out 5G networks. The FCC is involved in spectrum allocation to prevent interference or when two groups are using the same wavelengths at the same time making it less effective. That's why the FCC is running this auction which is intended to make sure that the groups that win have the capital to actually use the spectrum. Most of the proceeds go to the U.S. Treasury. Not all wavelengths are created equal. The highest frequencies only travel short distances but can transmit huge amounts of data with recent advancements in antennas and modems. The lowest frequencies can travel long distances but are less well-suited for pumping large amounts of data. The C-Band wavelengths that are up for auction are in the middle. It's actually called mid-band spectrum. Some call it ""goldilocks spectrum"" — as in it's just right for 5G. Verizon  the current U.S. leader in mobile subscribers doesn't have much mid-band spectrum. It's tried to make up for it with its ""ultra wideband"" 5G that promises to download 4K movies in seconds but those waves don't travel far. It's like a wi-fi hotspot. But if Verizon wins this auction it could build a network that's faster than the current 4G networks and doesn't require the company to build towers on every block. ""If you're Verizon you now have the opportunity to get the spectrum you need because you don't want to lose the beachhead of being perceived as the leading company. They kind of dominated the LTE or the 4G world"" said Walt Piecyk co-founder of LightShed Partners which closely follows spectrum auctions. ""Are you going to let T-Mobile or even AT&T take over the mantle as being the 5G network of choice?"" T-Mobile acquired licenses for a different block of mid-band spectrum through its merger with Sprint. So it doesn't need to win this auction as much as Verizon does. But it's still expected to be a bidder for a variety of reasons. If it wins that means that its rivals didn't. Even if it doesn't win bidding could increase the price. AT&T needs to win too. But it has been spending a lot in recent years. In 2018 it paid over $85 billion for Time Warner which included HBO. This spectrum would also be a large purchase but at the same time AT&T also needs mid-band spectrum to build the wireless network that powers its cash flow. Raymond James analyst Frank Louthan said in a note earlier this month that if AT&T spends $23 billion on spectrum its balance sheet could ""spook investors."" Cable companies like Comcast  Charter and Cox are also registered to bid. Charter and Comcast formed a joint venture called C&C Wireless Holding Company to bid on the frequencies. But the spectrum is less strategic for broadband companies and they are less likely to pay eye watering prices for it. One wildcard is Dish  whose chairman Charlie Ergen has shown a proclivity for snapping up spectrum and bidding up prices in the past. That's not every possible winner out of the 74 entities that registered to bid in the auction but those are the big ones. No big tech companies publicly registered to bid. There's an outside possibility that a tech giant has been quietly participating in the auction through one of the entities but that's very unlikely said Piecyk.

Each arrives at a starting price $200 below its predecessor in the S20 line. But the look feel and improved features of the S21 models may drive Android users to upgrade and perhaps even get some folks to consider switching from Team iPhone.

Let's start with price: The S21 starts at $799.99; the S21+ starts at $999.99; and the S21 Ultra which for the first time gets S Pen support starts at $1199.99. All S21 models offer 5G wireless.

Of course if you have a trade-in you don't necessarily need to pay that full price. With Samsung's limited offer you can get the the Galaxy S21 for as low as $4.17 a month the S21+ for $8.34 a month and the S21 Ultra for $13.89 a month (with an eligible trade-in value up to $700 on Samsung.com).

T-Mobile has a promotion earning you a free Galaxy S21 with a trade-in and up to $800 for trade-ins on the other new S21 models. AT&T is offering up to $800 off with a device trade-in and Verizon is offering up to $750.

Galaxy S21 or iPhone 12? How Samsung and Apple smartphones stack up

GameStop stock rally:Reddit group founded on 'high risk' returns hits Wall Street with GameStop effort

Samsung S21 phones: The look

The 6.2-inch AMOLED 2X Full HD+ 120 Hz display on the new Phantom Violet-colored S21 that Samsung lent to me sports dynamic refresh rates which makes flipping through Twitter for instance and between apps super smooth. The S21+ has a similar but larger display at 6.7 inches.

But the Phantom Black S21 Ultra – a smartphone that Darth Vader might wield – boasts a 6.8-inch AMOLED QHD+ 120 Hz display that boosts resolution up to 4K quality.

The displays are beautiful and certainly compare favorably to the iPhone competition. Compared to the iPhone 12 Pro the S21 looks just as crisp watching an NFL Network broadcast and the same football action – and a Washington Capitals game – appear almost 3D on the S21 Ultra.

What Samsung Galaxy S21 phones don't have

Often we focus on what the shiny sleek new phones feature but also important to users is what they're missing. In this case Samsung is following Apple's playbook in ditching the earbuds and plug-in charging brick from the box including only a USB cable to charge the phone. The 3.5 mm headphone jack was axed in the S20 and – sorry to the headphone hold-outs – it makes no miraculous return in the S21. All that comes in the box is the phone a USB C-to-USB C data cable and the ejection pin.

One of the selling points for Samsung Galaxy phones has been their expandability. This iteration cuts that out losing the microSD card slot and with it the ability to add on-board storage. While all base S21 models come with 128GB of storage that seems an unfortunate feature to lose as the phone gains an additional camera and more functionality that will prompt users to shoot more images and 8K videos the biggest storage hogs.

Also gone is some of the RAM its predecessor had standard leaving the S21 with only 8 gigabytes or 4GB less than the S20. And the backing has gone from Gorilla Glass which encased the entire S20 to reinforced plastic on the S21. As a result the S21 doesn't feel quite as sturdy as the S21 Ultra.

But it's the Samsung Galaxy cameras stupid.

Shutterbugs who rely on their smartphone for photos and videos will love the phones especially the top-of-the-line S21 Ultra Samsung's first with five cameras.

That’s right there’s one for the front and four on the back including a dual telephoto lens that captures up to 100X Space Zoom. I especially liked the ability to actually take a picture of the moon at night using its Zoom Lock for a more stable image. Wish I had this for last year's Super Moon. But there are more coming in 2021 with the first in March according to Space.com.

The S21 and S21+ top out at 30X Space Zoom.

All the phones have an improved Portrait Mode that lets you add blur studio lighting and other effects. It was as easy to use as iPhone's Portrait mode with a few more ways to tweak the image.

Also really cool is the Director’s View which shows you multiple angles while shooting video and lets you choose the one you prefer. You can also opt for what Samsung calls a Vlogger view which records a selfie point of view at the same time as what is happening in front of you. It's a feature that could come in handy for unboxing videos and other uses by online influencers.

And if you love taking photos of your kids or pets – and they don't like to pose for you – there’s an 8K video mode that lets you shoot a video clip and then when you are done grab the best individual image for a full high-res photo.

Another returning feature from the Galaxy S20 line which came out in February 2020 is the Single Take feature that captures 10 seconds of imagery you are asked to move your camera a bit to get slightly different angles. Then you can choose the best pictures or short video clips afterwards.

Another reason to love the S21 Ultra: it supports the S Pen which I did not test and are sold separately. There's one made for the S21 Ultra ($39.99) and you can also use third-party S Pens and those made for Note devices.

Galaxy phones: What reviewers love

At CNET senior associate editor Patrick Holland called the S21 Ultra ""pretty badass"" due to its lower price ""elegant design"" and S Pen support. ""The phone will also attract camera nerds thanks to the improvements Samsung made to the cameras"" he wrote.

The S21 is ""the no-brainer"" for those needing an upgrade Holland wrote. That's despite all we mentioned was not included – such as the wall charger headphones or and microSD slot.

The Tom's Guide tech site has the iPhone 12 Pro Max slightly ahead of the Galaxy S21 Ultra as the best phone on the market. But with its display the S21 Ultra ""has a few advantages over the iPhone 12 Pro Max"" with its adaptive display as ""a faster refresh rate enables smoother scrolling and better performance in games that support it"" writes the site's global editor-in-chief Mark Spoonauer

The S21 Ultra's screen ""is also a bit sharper"" with more slightly higher resolution. The S21 Ultra also comes out ahead with ""faster 5G and longer battery life"" he wrote. ""And while the S21 Ultra costs more up front it's a bit cheaper if you prefer more storage.""

Dieter Bohn executive editor at The Verge deemed the S21 Ultra's display ""the best screen on a smartphone."" As for the improved photography claims he wrote ""Focusing is fast and accurate the focal plane seems bigger there’s no discernible shutter lag and most of all: the pictures look better.""

The smartphone wars tighten

As for the smartphone competition Samsung took the lead in the U.S. market from Apple in the third quarter of 2020 increasing its share to 34% compared to Apple's 30% according to Strategy Analytics.

Even though Apple had a record-setting October-December 2020 quarter – with iPhone revenue hitting an all-time quarterly high of $65.6 billion – it will still fall short of Android phones' dominance in the U.S. eMarketer estimates. During 2021 Android will command 54% of smartphone users while Apple gets 46%.

Samsung expects its new wave of smartphones will further its dominance of the Android competition too.

At bantamweight the list of fighters with a claim to be in the title picture is a long one but with flyweight getting its sea legs again thanks to the emergence of champion Deiveson Figueiredo as one of the UFC’s best a trio of wins might be all it takes to get into the championship discussion. And considering that Osbourne a former bantamweight and featherweight can make 125 with no issues he’s all-in.

“Not a lot of people can make flyweight” he said. “Me I'm fortunate enough to be able to make it and it won't be that hard because I really don't cut any weight for '35. I cut zero weight. I literally show up in Vegas a week before my fight at 140 137.”

That can be an issue against bigger fighters who cut a lot of weight to make the bantamweight or featherweight limit but Osbourne never considered that to be a factor in his decision. He’s just in the mood to pick up some gold sooner rather than later.

“I fought at '45 three times and I've always been the smaller body” he said. “But size wise I think it's just my legs were small. Size can play a factor in a lot of different aspects but it's you and how you are mentally.”

And mentally the Milwaukee standout is rock solid heading into his first bout since debuting with a loss to Brian Kelleher in January 2020. It was a disappointing start to his UFC career but the Dana White’s Contender Series graduate has put it behind him knowing that the last time he lost in 2017 before the Kelleher bout he ran off four consecutive wins and earned a UFC contract. So he’s ready to do the same thing again."

World’s first electric truck

Make/model: Rivian R1T

Price: $67500

0-60: 3 seconds

Launch: June 2021

Irvine-based Rivian will deliver the world’s first electric (and fastest) truck in June and is “primed to set the automotive world on its head” according to Car and Driver magazine.

The auto industry is abuzz. Why? The interior is warm and rich rivaling a Lamborghini and its electric motors and low center of gravity deliver a sports-car feel. “There’s not a faster truck in the world” says Rivian Executive Creative Director Larry Parker. It will take you from 0-60 mph in 3 seconds and take you off-road into the mountains. “It’s designed for the outdoors” he says “whether it’s a journey through South America or a weekend trip with your friends.”

Why have Amazon Ford and T. RowePrice invested in Rivian? Rivian closed on $2.6 billion in funding last month bringing its total to $8 billion. Experts put its valuation at $27.6 billion. Ford has invested $500 million while Amazon invested $700 million. Other investors include T. Rowe Price and BlackRock. “Over the last decade Rivian has been creating a robust organization built for the long term” Parker says.

What about Rivian’s Irvine expansion? Rivian’s presence in Irvine began as a team of 16 people focused on battery technologies. As that team grew Parker says Rivian saw Irvine as the ideal location for its future headquarters. “Access to top talent to off-road driving the beach and the diversity that California has to offer is really enticing to our organization” he says.

A whole new class of vehicle

Make/model: Hyundai Santa Cruz

Price: Not yet announced

Style: Compact crossover

Launch: July 2021

With the Santa Cruz Hyundai has created a whole new class of pickup — a sports adventure vehicle — that is one of the most anticipated launches of 2021.

“It might be the next big thing in the pickup market” HotCars reports.

It was designed right here in Irvine so we asked Hyundai Design Manager Bradley Arnold to sum up the Santa Cruz.

“Segment shattering” he says. “It represents an entirely new class of vehicle that meets many traditional SUV-buyer needs coupled with truck-like capabilities in a design package the U.S. buyer has never seen.”

The four-door crossover is designed to appeal to younger drivers with active lifestyles — and anyone who wants a truck bed on a compact body.

“It definitely fights above its weight class” he says.

Arnold whose dad was a race-team mechanic for the Honda motocross team learned the car-design trade at the ArtCenter in Pasadena where he fell in love with “anything that had an engine was fast made some noise — and looked cool.”

He joined Hyundai because he believes in its mission: “To be provocative always pushing the envelope.”

On top of that he gets to design cars in Southern California long a hotbed for car culture.

“Every day we’re tasked with coming up with the future esthetic for the brand” he says. “And we feel this is the perfect spot to do that.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjAvMDEvMDIvYnVzaW5lc3MvZGVhbGJvb2svY2FybG9zLWdob3NuLWphcGFuLWxlYmFub24uaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Did Carlos Ghosn Flee Japan?,"… and we’re back!

Carlos Ghosn’s escape committee

The former head of Nissan and Renault managed to evade 24-hour surveillance in Tokyo and spirit himself out of Japan to Lebanon. How he did it increasingly sounds like a movie-level caper.

Associates planned the heist for months the FT reports citing unnamed sources. They hired private security operatives who worked in multiple countries.

Mr. Ghosn made it onto a private plane bound for Turkey and arrived in Lebanon early Monday the WSJ adds. (A Lebanese news media outlet claimed that he had hidden in a box meant for musical equipment; the world’s tabloids perhaps with an eye on that movie version reckon it must have been a double bass case.) He entered Lebanon on a French passport.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpbmV4dHJhLmNvbS9ibG9ncG9zdGluZy8xOTgyMC9mYXN0LWFuZC1lYXN5LWFkZHJlc3Npbmctc3lzdGVt0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,FAST and Easy Addressing System,"Realtime payments have been a hot topic in payments world for the last two decades. It’s because even if the current RTGS systems allow the funds to be transferred between parties they do not finalize the transaction in realtime which is a critical need in todays world as the daily life is becoming faster and payment relations need immidiate results in order to continue the business.

The first known instant payment system ( they all more or less refer to the same thing: instant payment system realtime payment system immediate payment system faster payment system) is launched in South Korea in 2001. Since than a lot of country all around the world have developed and started operating realtime payment systems.

As a result of the technological changes and digitalisation cash usage is diminishing gradually. This trend is not only valid for Turkey it is global fact and there are countries where cashless transactions have reached and passed the ratio of the cash based transactions. It is needless to say that Covid 19 pandemic became a catalysor to this trend.

Digital payments require immediate confirmations by its nature. It is achieved in card payments since there is a special setup and arrangements for this goal. Although the financial money movement takes place with a 1 or 2 days latency the merchant or the peer knows that the payment is guaranteed and continues the business. But when it comes to account based ACH payments there is a gap between the order given for a payment to take place and movements of funds between the payer and the payee. This gap can be tolerable for some type of business relations but on the other hand it is not an efficient way for some other businesses.

Source: https://www.mastercard.us/content/dam/mccom/en-us/business-payments/documents/real-time-payments-whitepaper-sept-2018.pdf

Account based realtime payments is a solution given to those businesses and people who need this functionality for their daily life. It is 24/7/365. If the payer and the payee are within the same network (say have accounts at the same bank or payment institution) immediate and uninterrupted payment is always possible. But when they are customers of different entities there is need for a central authority to process and settle the payments between the payer and the payee’s agents. Here we see the realtime payment systems coming into the picture.

Turkey used to be credit card dominant market but we see that debit card usage is gaining market share gradually and constantly. That means that cardholders are now willing to pay from their checking account rather than the credit account.

Source : https://bkm.com.tr/raporlar-ve-yayinlar/donemsel-bilgiler/

There is no difference between an account to account payment and payment with a debit card from a cardholders perspective (Only difference that is worth to mention could be the chargeback protection given by the card schemes) In both cases payment is done from the balance of the checking account. The ease of using card as a means of payment is always higher . So if you make Account to Account Payments as easy as card payments people will choose it. Of course only infrastructure is not sufficient there must be systems and products designed to use that channel as payment method.

The Central Bank of the Repoublic of Turkey has announced (CBRT) that a new retail payment system called Instant and Continuous Transfer of Funds (FAST) is becoming functionable by 8th of January 2020 after a pilot phase and with 50 TRY as a starting limit which will be increased to 1.000 TRY gradually according to the usage.

Together with FAST a proxy payment solution called Easy Addressing System (KOLAS) is also being launched. With this system telephone numbers ID numbers or e-mail addresses can be used as proxies instead of long and hard to remember IBAN. Infrastructure is hosted by BKM.

Source: https://www.albaraka.com.tr/en/iban-free-money-transfer-with-easy-address.aspx

In a proxy payment system standardized IBAN is being used in background and customers does not need to remember or type long numbers as they use unique proxies that are special to them and can not be owned by anybody else.

Explaining one of Wall Street’s hottest trends,"American flags hang from the facade of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) building in New York January 28 2021.

What is a SPAC?

A special purpose acquisitions company is essentially a shell company set up by investors with the sole purpose of raising money through an IPO to eventually acquire another company. For instance Diamond Eagle Acquisition Corp. was set up in 2019 and went public as a SPAC that December. It then announced a merger with DraftKings and gambling tech platform SBTech. DraftKings began trading as a public company when the deal closed in April. So a SPAC has no commercial operations — it makes no products and does not sell anything. In fact the SPAC's only assets are typically the money raised in its own IPO according to the SEC. Usually a SPAC is created or sponsored by a team of institutional investors Wall Street professionals from the world of private equity or hedge funds while even high-profile CEOs like Richard Branson and fellow billionaire Tilman Fertitta have jumped on the trend and formed their own SPACs.

That's because when a SPAC raises money the people buying into the IPO do not know what the eventual acquisition target company will be. Institutional investors with track records of success can more easily convince people to invest in the unknown. That's also why a SPAC is also often called a ""blank check company."" Once the IPO raises capital (SPAC IPOs are usually priced at $10 a share) that money goes into an interest-bearing trust account until the SPAC's founders or management team finds a private company looking to go public through an acquisition. Once an acquisition is completed (with SPAC shareholders voting to approve the deal) the SPAC's investors can either swap their shares for shares of the merged company or redeem their SPAC shares to get back their original investment plus the interest accrued while that money was in trust. The SPAC sponsors typically get about a 20% stake in the final merged company. However SPAC sponsors also have a deadline by which they have to find a suitable deal typically within about two years of the IPO. Otherwise the SPAC is liquidated and investors get their money back with interest.

Why are SPACs suddenly popular?

SPACs have been around for decades and often existed as last resorts for small companies that would have otherwise had trouble raising money on the open market. But they've recently become more prevalent because of the extreme market volatility caused in part by the global pandemic. Many companies chose to postpone their IPOs (for fear that the market volitlity could spoil their stock's public debut). But others chose the alternate route to an IPO by merging with a SPAC. A SPAC merger allows a company to go public and get a capital influx more quickly than it would have with a conventional IPO as a SPAC acquisition can be closed in just a few months versus the ""grueling process"" process of registering an IPO with the SEC which can take up to six months. Also in a SPAC merger the target company is able to negotiate its own fixed valuation with the SPAC sponsors.

However this simple philosophy seems less applicable today and it may be the case that the dollar has slowly lost its potency as a primary mechanism for messaging of what consumers do and do not want.

For instance the introduction of apple slices and yogurt packs in McDonald’s Happy Meals was not due to a drop in sales or lost interest in French fries. It was due to external pressures and increased scrutiny from legislators regarding the marketing of unhealthy food choices to children. And McDonald’s apple adoption has dramatically impacted the apple consumption rates within the US.

Marketing healthier options is one thing but marketing morality is another. One of McDonald’s long-time rivals Burger King has engaged in advocacy campaigning with some success (in regards to anti-bullying) and some ridicule (in regards to greenhouse gas emissions). Although the fast-food sector has a broad target market and the abhorrence to bullying is widespread it is safe to say that methane gas is not at the forefront of their consumers’ minds when ordering a Whopper.

Firms leveraging situations and social issues is not new but showcasing their moral authority despite a disinterested consumer base is. Even when attempting anonymity the presence of a brand means that a message is never truly altruistic and this was most notably demonstrated by Frito Lay’s anti-commercial commercial during the peak of COVID-19 cases in April 2020.

A more recent attempt to showcase a company’s concern for society’s well-being is Coca-Cola’s #OpenToBetter campaign in the UK which encourages consumers to embrace change and put their resolutions for a better world on public display. But do consumers really want self-reflection whenever they sip soda? And let’s be real this is a marketing ploy since the design is clearly created for brand engagement.

Corporate social responsibility (CSR) has evolved beyond business interest in sustainability to various levels of accountability and virtuous ventures and forms of Corporate Social Justice (CSJ) are on the rise. Even algorithms are being redefined to ensure fairness in our search for products and information and social action is being viewed as appropriate and in some cases warranted for the business world.

There is a danger however in desiring products that not only suit personal wants but also social needs since the impact is not always measurable nor effective. Businesses achieve success by focusing on areas of specialization and so it may be best for firms to stick to what they do best and not enter realms they have no prior experience in even when they have the best of intentions.

Rational consumers seeking value rather than virtue must work harder to understand the corporate social responsibility bandwagon companies are jumping on and spot those who are abusing or misusing the conscious consumer trend.

And so here are four key questions consumers should ask themselves about all CSR campaigns.

1. What’s in it for the corporation?

This question is not to suggest that corporations are inherently up to no good. Rather it is important to understand a corporation’s motivations for embarking on a CSR campaign and how the campaign might also bolster the corporation’s bottom line. For instance it was discovered in India that corporate promoters were distributing CSR donations to their own NGOs (non-governmental organizations) in order for the money to make its way back into their own pockets.

2. Is there potential for diverting attention or misrepresentation?

British Petroleum topped Fortune’s annual corporate accountability rating for CSR in 2004 2005 and 2007 (and achieved second place in 2006) and the social initiatives that assured the accolades such as BP’s turtle sanctuary seemed to serve as a distraction to the negligence regarding production practices leading up to the 2010 oil spill and its aftermath. And who could forget the Volkswagen dieselgate scandal in 2015 whereas just a year prior the company was given acclaim for its sustainable initiatives.

3. Should issues be branded and how does it position others in the industry?

An odd side effect of social labelling or virtue signaling is that it almost simultaneously positions all those products not bearing such badges or launching advocacy campaigns as being devoid of social consciousness – which is likely not the case. Take for example the recent Vogue piece claiming to be pushing gender norms for the fashion industry. Are brands that cater to genders then in the wrong? Should Lane Bryant and Men’s Warehouse begin offering androgynous attire? Or is Vogue pushing a moot point since gender and fashion don’t have to conflict and people can simply decide for themselves what they want to wear and not make a fuss over it. Men dressing in gowns is not new and fashion should be a personal preference not a platform for self-promotion.

4. Is there potential for doing more harm than good?

A 2011 study by Germany’s University of Hohenheim discovered that some Fairtrade certified coffee farmers actually became worse off in comparison to conventional producers due to being limited by certification for investing in improvements or taking advantage of expansion opportunities. It was found that in comparison to one-third of their conventional counterparts 45 percent of farmers with Fairtrade certification had “per capita incomes below the extreme poverty line.” The primary reasons cited as to why the non-certified producers were better off was due to having greater productivity yields given their ability to properly manage their land as well as expand their land ownership as needed. Basically the standards imposed for Fairtrade certification inhibited growth prospects since to be certified a farm must be classified as “small” and therefore must remain as such.

It seems that for the crowded field of CSR campaigns to remain navigable consumers must demand transparency or simply require businesses to remain in their own court of affairs. Those who side with economist Milton Friedman’s doctrine claim that the sole responsibility of a business is business — to generate profits and further growth prospects.

In the Nobel Laureate’s own words “there is one and only one social responsibility of business — to use its resources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits so long as it stays within the rules of the game which is to say engages in open and free competition without deception or fraud.”

In this sense businesses are doing right by society by creating jobs engaging in production and contributing to economic advancement while providing value to those wanting to buy. It is no secret that consumption can bring pleasure and those obsessed with Target can attest to this fact. Even the simple act of grocery shopping has been known to bring joy.

According to Ramit Sethi the author and founder of the website I Will Teach You To Be Rich and quoted in Business Insider “a business idea is simply a skill or knowledge that solves a person’s problem and that they want to pay you money for.” Needs and wants within a marketplace prompt entrepreneurial mindsets which in turn can improve a society’s well-being indirectly (by increasing the standard of living) or directly (by targeting specific needs for niche audiences).

And that is wonderful in and of itself.

Take for example the ability for those with Parkinson’s to now “eat with confidence” thanks to Liftware. Or a product like Lifestraw that can be used by those who love to camp and hike or those across the globe truly struggling for access to clean water. Each is making the world a better place—not through some grand stated mission of social responsibility but by serving consumers.

Businesses who are ethical responsible and generate value should be rewarded with profits for their production purposes alone and consumers expecting more may discover that enticing business to partake in societal welfare beyond their scope has potential to make matters worse — often while pulling the wool over our eyes.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdyZWVuY2FyY29uZ3Jlc3MuY29tLzIwMjEvMDEvMjAyMTAxMzEtaHVhbG9uZy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,First Hualong One Gen III reactor in commercial operation,"Unit 5 of China’s Fuqing Nuclear Power Plant the first project to adopt China’s indigenous Generation III nuclear power technology Hualong One (HPR 1000) has been put into commercial operation China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) announced. The success marks a milestone for the development of China’s nuclear power making China the fourth country to master its indigenous Generation III nuclear power technology following the US France and Russia.

Generation III reactors are evolutionary improvements on the Generation II designs—basically the current fleet of nuclear reactors. Generation IV design are still emerging and are not expected to be operational before the 2020s.

Hualong One is CNNC’s Generation III pressurized water reactor with complete independent intellectual property rights developed and designed by the corporation on the basis of more than 30 years of nuclear power research design manufacturing construction and operation experiences.

Yu Jianfeng chairman of CNNC said that the corporation will accelerate the progress of mass constructing Hualong One reactors and developing new series technologies in a bid to promote the Hualong One to export and achieve the target of carbon neutrality.

With a design life of 60 years Hualong One reactor adopts a 177-reactor core design that refueling the fuel every 18 months. It uses a combination of “active and passive” safety systems and a double-shell containment which meets the latest international nuclear safety requirements.





Active and passive cooling systems of the HPR1000 (Hualong One). Red line − active systems; Green line − passive systems; IRWST − in-containment refuelling water storage tank. Xing et al.

The installed capacity of each Hualong One unit reaches nearly 1200 MW e  and each unit is able to generate nearly 10 billion kWh of electricity annually meeting the demand of 1 million population within a moderately developed country.

The electricity generated by a Hualong One unit is an equivalent to reducing the consumption of 3.12 million tons of standard coal and emission of 8.16 million tons of carbon dioxide annually as well as an equivalent to plantation of more than 70 million trees annually.

Units 1-4 of China’s Fuqing Nuclear Power Plant developed by CNNC were fully put into commercial operation on 17 Sept 2017. The four units have generated more than 130 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity in total. Compared with fossil-fuel energy of the same scale it is equivalent to reducing standard coal consumption by 40.32 million tons and reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 105.44 million tons which is equivalent to 293000 hectares of afforestation.

Units 5 and 6 have both adopted China’s independent third-generation nuclear power technology Hualong One and began construction on 7 May and 22 Dec 2015 respectively.

Because I had read this thread in October when the electricians arrived midway through my install I asked them about the power blaster. Their initial pull sheet did not include a power blaster. I told them (and my installation advisor) that monitoring was very important to me and asked if they could include a power blaster for me. There was an unrelated problem with the initial pull sheet so the electricians had to return a second day with the correct parts. On the second electrical install day they brought and installed a power blaster for me. I can't be sure how much my request and/or the fact that the electricians had to return another day anyway factored into the end result of getting a power blaster.



I'm very thankful for the info others have posted here since I would not have known anything about this otherwise!



The head electrician mentioned that Tesla was phasing out the power blasters and moving to a different solution. He did not reveal anything more specific than that so it still isn't clear to me whether my power blaster was accidentally or purposefully omitted.

I was trying to write the third part in my “Tesla [TSLA] Retail Investors Have an Advantage — Here’s Why” series (if you haven’t done so already read part 1 here and part 2 here) and I kept getting distracted by reading about the various short squeezes currently being carried out on Wall Street headlined by Gamestop. On that topic I am amazed by the parallels that the WallStreetBets subreddit has to a lot of my own research over the past few years.

Before I go on if you’re thinking “I’m on CleanTechnica what does this have to do with the future of clean technology” I’ll admit up front this is less about the technology and more about how important the financial success of cleantech companies like Tesla is. If you’d like more on my reasoning I have a three-part series on that I wrote too answering why I feel the financial success of Tesla is hugely important. While this short squeeze may not seem like that big of a deal for clean technology I think it could have repercussions that resonate for decades and really change trajectories.

Also I think it’s super important to disclose — I do not own any Gamestop stock nor any shares of any companies that have been named as being affected by the most recent short squeeze spree except Beyond Meat Inc which I closed out my position on Wednesday. (And as an aside that you may not care about when I get interested in a company I usually buy a super small position before doing research on it so that I can feel like I have some “skin in the game” that justifies my research better and I add to that after I research it or sell it after I determine it wasn’t so neat. I love the Beyond product. I’m a meat eater but I prefer it over meat. I bought two stocks for about $70 in May of 2019. By the time I started digging into them a couple weeks later the stock price had nearly doubled and I couldn’t justify buying more for that price. So we’re talking about a $260 gain here not life changing money or anything. I do intend to research Beyond more if it falls again.)

And as always this isn’t financial advice. I literally represent myself as a puppet online. If you’re using this for financial advice you better read through it and decide if I’m crazy or not first because I’m literally a puppet here.

With that let’s start by explaining what happened…

The GME Short Squeeze

Simply put a bunch of hedge funds decided that GameStop shouldn’t be long for this world — and in a traditional way they have a point. I’m a gamer and I despise GameStop. The last time I bought three new games from them online I got three games in the mail all opened including one that was missing the online code. Upon emailing customer service they told me these open games were clearly “new” and while they would take them back I should think about if I want the games more next time.

So their online business has issues their in-store experience sucks and it looks like a flea market and there is a belief that game sales are transitioning to mostly digital so they have been having issues and closing down stores to try to find a workable solution.

And while I have some pretty major issues with GameStop the company has existed for ages and has some decent equity so it can — hopefully — reshuffle its business and find a new plan that will work for it.

Alas a bunch of hedge fund managers decided instead the business was dead and the best way to take advantage of that was to short their shares. They took out an insane short position — literally 148% of the shares — because they were so greedy to bleed the company dry and to pocket all the money themselves.

If you don’t know what shorting is the quick version is it’s when a fund borrows a share someone else owns and sells it hoping that it will go down in price so they can buy it later before returning to owner thus making a profit. This is legal and while it can once in a great while prove to be valuable by providing a reward for people who dig into a company’s financials and find something amiss (like what happened to a certain trucking company which shall not be named) it causes an incentive for these hedge funds to spread falsehoods about these companies to drive down their share price even further.

For the companies this makes things a lot more difficult as it limits the options a company in trouble has to get out of trouble. It’s traditionally very difficult to raise money when you have tons of money bet against you.

In this case a bunch of people on Reddit discovered that these hedge funds had shorted GameStop so heavily that a small increase in demand could cause a massive short squeeze — basically if prices rise on a shorted stock the entity holding the shorted stock needs to have money to cover the potential loss in case the price doesn’t drop again. If that becomes too high or they don’t have the money they are forced to buy back their shares at a higher price. This creates additional demand on the buy side pushing the share price higher and keeping the process going until the majority of shorts have covered.

These redditors saw a company they felt was fundamentally undervalued and started purchasing shares. The same thing was done with other stocks that these hedge funds have massively shorted such as Bed Bath and Beyond AMC Beyond Meat (although this one I see less often listed) KOSS and a handful of others.

These hedge funds which for years have been manipulating the market especially on the short side suddenly saw their bets giving them massive losses. One source recently stated that Melvin Capital which is one of the hedge funds being the most “hurt” by this loses $1 billion dollars for every $7 increase in GameStop stock.

Melvin Capital supposedly only has about $12.5 billion dollars of capital. As I write this in the past 10 days GameStop is up more than $150 per share meaning that unless GameStop’s price drops quickly Melvin Capital is on the hook for around $7.5 billion more than it has if these numbers are correct. I’ll admit these numbers seem fanciful but I for one honestly hope they are true.

On Thursday a lot of the trading apps —headlined by Robinhood and Ameritrade — decided to stop allowing people to buy these shares (the reasons and intent are debated) while hedge funds could still do whatever they wanted.

Incredibly after an early signal that perhaps the Biden administration would prop up these greedy hedge funds — again like in 2008 — AOC suggested that Robinhood and Ameritrade’s actions weren’t fair for retail investors and they should be investigated. Shortly after posting this Ted Cruz agreed with her.

I’m shocked because both sides of the aisle in the government often work more for their donors than their constituents. Remember 2008? These hedge funds and giant banks that took on tons of risk got bailed out. The people who got screwed by their market manipulation at retail got left holding the bag. This time it seems like they are aware and even the media narrative that started as a straight “Oh no stop the crazy redditors!” has shifted to more of a “the redditors used a loophole the hedge funds usually only get to use” narrative.

And let me not understate this — I think this week could be one of the most consequential in my life for how the market operates in the future. There is now a tool by regular people to stop and punish companies doing underhanded financial manipulation and leaving them with the bag. In the past if you liked GameStop looked at it’s financials and figured that it was undervalued — because on the surface it was — as far as I’m concerned these hedge funds were stealing your money by using manipulative tools that they had access to so they could pick winners and losers.

Where Does Tesla Come In?

If any of this sounds familiar to you I agree. Reading about this has felt like déjà vu all over again from when I was first starting to research Tesla stock. I discovered a company that sure seemed to be fundamentally undervalued compared to what I felt it would do in the future. If you look at my previous articles one of the big things I did was look at the arguments against Tesla as an investment — when I had started writing I owned 8 shares of Tesla but felt that was a massive risk. Since I was doing the research anyway I figured why not publish what I could find? CleanTechnica Chief Editor Zach promised that even if I uncovered something that wasn’t positive we’d run it.

I never did.

In fact on October 7 2019 I wrote a sort of apology called Tesla FUD: I Was Wrong where I felt compelled to explain why after the research I did I went against my early declarations that I didn’t intend to add any more stock. I instead started adding to my position due to what I found.

The thing is — Tesla is the first stock to on a massive level prove to retail investors that the big hedge funds didn’t know what they were doing. The biggest thing that I felt that I uncovered which quite frankly I was surprised didn’t get much play concerned one of the early “bear theses” about Tesla was that it was purposely not putting away almost any money for warranty work and that this would cause a giant cash crunch when the warranty work came due.

This seemed reasonable so I dug into the publicly available data for Tesla warranties and found out that it sure seemed like Tesla didn’t have a warranty accounting problem … except that it was holding onto too much money and not paying out much at all for warranty work. I published my first article on that here citing the website WarrantyWeek.com and showing that it seemed like Tesla was doing just fine. This caused Eric Arnum the editor of WarrantyWeek to reach out to me and we chatted back and forth about what we could determine from those financials to see if I was on track. That led to a second article.

I’d really suggest going and reading those articles but here is the main takeaway I remember directly from Arnum:

“Note that the only [companies] with higher months in reserves than Tesla are Cummins and Boeing and both of them have massive warranty crises on their hands right now — Cummins with the diesel engine emissions and Boeing with the 737 MAX. In other words Tesla is positioned like its peers who are in crisis even though Tesla is not in a crisis.“

To me this was a watershed moment. The stock analysts were either lying to manipulate the market or were incredibly stupid. I think it was a combination of both honestly — some were probably trying to manipulate the market because at the time Tesla was the most heavily shorted stock on the market. It didn’t matter that the publicly available information and the experts in the field were saying it was wrong. Heck a few of the comments even claimed that Arnum and I didn’t really understand warranty accounting but these shorts on Wall Street did.

Warranty accounting was a great thing for the shorts to aim at because it sure sounded scary and it’s a relatively complex financial maneuver and as I pointed out in one of my articles it is one of the places where a company can stash money or pull money from legally to make themselves look better or worse. It took me a few hours of research to ensure that I wasn’t looking at something wrong for the first article and I wanted feedback to see what I missed. Getting in touch with Arnum was incredible and just confirmed that I was right.

It to me was the point that I realized the fix was in. When I could research a company and find things to directly contradict bearish claims within a few hours that really opened my eyes to how manipulative Wall Street analysts and hedge funds are. Most financial analysts only cover a couple handfuls of stock at most all from the same industry. I remember finding while working on another series that I did that looked at Gordon Johnson’s issues analyzing the stock that he only had recommendations for somewhere around 10–15 stocks all of which were in the same sector. Which means quite frankly that in a week he should be able to churn out actual data to prove that the warranty stuff he was claiming was wrong if he cared to look.

And Johnson was just one of many. Another firm that was happily flaunting its Tesla short position?

Melvin Capital.

Yup that’s right — the same group that is apparently being the most damaged by the GameStop short position it held was one of the biggest cheerleaders for Tesla’s demise.

And here’s the thing — such hedge funds could have their analysts go on CNBC or whatever and proclaim that Tesla was making completely fraudulent warranty claims and the SEC did nothing. These statements had material impact on the stock. Shorting a ton of shares had a material impact on the stock.

But when Elon Musk decided to tweet that he was thinking about taking Tesla private specifically due to these market manipulations he was forced by the SEC to step down from Tesla’s board and pay $40 million in fines to “harmed investors” (a.k.a. short sellers who lost money due to his tweet).

It’s a clear double standard but one the SEC has had difficulty (to put it nicely) figuring out how to police.

Tesla Short Seller Lies Brought Us Here

So here’s what I think strongly: Thanks to the things that Tesla does to give retail investors equal footing to financial institutions retail investors saw through the garbage that these short sellers were spewing. With a little bit of research on our own time we discovered the lies and we saw how the game was being played.

I think in large part this led to these redditors realizing that they too could hold “diamond hands” by using the market to work against hedge funds in the same way that they for ages had been using against retail investors for their own advantage. If anything the ones who manipulated the share price for GameStop were not redditors but the hedge funds by trying to suck the company dry.

I can’t guarantee that the SEC will see it this way. I can’t say that I feel like they work for me as an investor. But retail investors have now developed a weapon to fight back against any greedy hedge funds when try to pull this garbage in the future.

Okay But … Cleantech?

I promised that I’d bring this all back around to cleantech so here goes. I believe and have believed for a while that a big part of the reason that Tesla was so strongly shorted is that these hedge funds were very comfortable looking at their traditional markets and determining how to value them and advise people and they didn’t want new technology rising up and disrupting things. The climate crisis wouldn’t be solved by some crazy upstart like Tesla — it would be solved by great companies like Exxon and GM on their own timetable. Or so they believed. An upstart like Tesla was just dangerous to the system they profited so heavily from.

Tesla’s rally as well as the current short squeeze rally are built on discovering new fundamentals. I feel like the current one is more about sticking it to these hedge funds because the script has flipped — retail investors are smarter than them and we proved that with Tesla. How many Tesla-like companies did we miss because they were smothered by hedge funds before they were allowed to grow? How much power could we as retail investors have if we decided to reshape the world how we want it to be and started investing in the companies we want to take us there?

This is the natural end to what I really feel Tesla’s stock journey sent us on. A new paradigm has arrived. People have used the internet to discover tools to allow us to rise up and rewrite the future one in which greedy scumbags that are only in it for the money will find themselves with less and less power.

There appears to be no reasonable way to justify GameStop’s stock at the prices it’s at just like these hedge fund managers have been crying for ages that Tesla is a broken growth story that is about to go to zero … while it added 50% capacity a year. The future is going to stop believing in this — and I for one am ecstatic to know this is where we’re headed and think it’s a signal that we’re going to see a massive shift into clean technology in the near future.

If you own shares in GameStop for this ride congrats and I’m there with you spiritually. Like I said earlier I think this week may be the most consequential week for evening out the playing field for all investors and could be incredibly important to determining what we want our future to look like. Kudos to you.

Who knows if my work writing about Tesla has ever helped anyone to look into things more themselves and change how they view Wall Street but I know it’s worked for me. I feel like the last couple of years have been leading to this where we now are all waking up with new eyes. It’s going to be one heck of a journey.

Tesla (TSLA -3.76%) is a car company worth over $800 billion that has never turned a profit selling cars. Despite a cult following and intense brand loyalty Tesla has been unable to wring any profits out of the half a million cars it now sells annually.

To be clear Tesla did report a profit for 2020 under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) marking the company's first full year of profitability. But that profit did not come from the core business of manufacturing cars. Tesla booked a whopping $1.58 billion of revenue from selling regulatory credits last year more than the previous three years combined. Tesla's net income of $721 million in 2020 turns into a substantial loss if those regulatory credit sales are backed out.

A regulatory bonanza

Certain U.S. states award regulatory credits to automakers for selling electric vehicles. Automakers must acquire a minimum number of these credits to comply with regulatory requirements. These credits can be bought and sold so an automaker that doesn't sell enough electric vehicles can buy credits from other automakers that do.

This regulatory credit system is an attempt by governments to encourage electric vehicle production and reduce emissions. It's ended up essentially subsidizing Tesla's money-losing car operation. Since Tesla only produces electric cars it's able to sell reams of credits to other automakers that are unwilling or unable to produce enough electric cars.

It should be obvious that this situation is not going to last forever. Automakers are aggressively ramping up their electric vehicle efforts and there's little reason to believe that Tesla has any real advantage beyond its brand. One example: General Motors is pouring billions into its electric vehicle efforts with plans for dozens of models over the next few years. GM also recently unveiled a new commercial electric vehicle brand and it already has delivery giant FedEx as a customer.

This regulatory credit windfall for Tesla will start to vanish as other automakers ramp up their electric vehicle sales. Tesla will then need to figure out how to profitably manufacture cars.

An extreme valuation

Tesla's valuation of more than $800 billion is quadruple that of Toyota. Toyota sold nearly 10 million cars in 2020 compared to half a million for Tesla.

I would argue that it probably won't matter how well Tesla does over the coming years because the valuation is so extreme that a positive result for investors would require absolutely everything to go right. The company can do well even very well and the stock could still fall apart.

Here's an example from the dot-com bubble. Cisco Systems stock hit an all-time high around $80 in early 2000. The networking hardware company was valued at nearly $550 billion at its peak.

Today Cisco is the dominant provider of enterprise networking hardware. The company's share of the enterprise switch market hovers around 50% despite no shortage of low-cost competition. Cisco's revenue has soared from about $19 billion in 2000 to nearly $50 billion today. Net income has shot up from $2.7 billion to over $11 billion. Cisco the company has been an unquestionable success story.

Cisco the stock on the other hand has been an unmitigated disaster. If you bought Cisco stock at its peak you're down over 40% more than 20 years later. The company is worth around $200 billion today. You were right about the company but very wrong about the stock.

Tesla the company doing well in the long run does not in any way guarantee that Tesla the stock does well. You can be right about Tesla becoming a top automaker and still lose your shirt investing in the stock. Even if Tesla does wean itself off regulatory credits and starts manufacturing millions of cars annually at a profit the valuation is so deep into the stratosphere that it may not even matter.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvYWxpc3RhaXJjaGFybHRvbi8yMDIxLzAxLzMxL3RoZS10ZXNsYS1yb2Fkc3Rlci1oYXMtYmVlbi1kZWxheWVkLWFnYWluLXRoaXMtdGltZS11bnRpbC0yMDIyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Tesla Roadster Has Been Delayed Again This Time Until 2022,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/alistaircharlton/2021/01/31/the-tesla-roadster-has-been-delayed-again-this-time-until-2022/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvYWxpc3RhaXJjaGFybHRvbi8yMDIxLzAxLzMxL3RoZS10ZXNsYS1yb2Fkc3Rlci1oYXMtYmVlbi1kZWxheWVkLWFnYWluLXRoaXMtdGltZS11bnRpbC0yMDIyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcnNjb29wcy5jb20vMjAyMS8wMS9ob3ctbXVjaC13b3JzZS1pcy1hLXRlc2xhLW1vZGVsLTNzLXJhbmdlLW92ZXItMjAwMC1taWxlcy1pbi10aGUtd2ludGVyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Much Worse Is A Tesla Model 3's Range Over 2000 Miles In The Winter?,"Engineering Explained drives in freezing temperatures to test how much less efficient a Tesla is in the cold

There’s a common refrain among EV skeptics that cold temperatures will wreck havoc on the car’s range. Engineering Explained’s Jason Fenske has taken his Tesla Model 3 on two 2000 mile road trips to find out how much impact winter weather will have on it.

The answer is that it does make a difference but not as much as you might think. Yes batteries operate most efficiently within a specific temperature band and heating the cabin (especially in older Teslas) takes a lot of energy. But the results are comparable to ICE-powered cars.

Fenske actually drove his Tesla 2500 miles in the winter but is primarily interested in the 2000-mile section that he also drove in the summer. Whereas in warmer weather he averaged 285-watt hours per mile in the cold he averaged 338-watt hours per mile.

That’s a difference of a little less than 20% and was reflected in his Tesla’s range estimates dropping from 250 miles to 212 miles. That’s much less than previous studies that have found results of around a 40% drop. Admittedly this is a single test but even during the coldest least efficient part of this drive Fenske’s Tesla only performed 20% worse than the least efficient part of his summer drive.

Crucially this lines up pretty well with how much less efficient internal combustion cars are during the winter. According to fueeconomy.gov gas-powered cars are about 15% less fuel-efficient at 20°F than they would be at 77°F.

Bearing in mind that Fenske was driving at temperatures as low as 0°F and that one of the major purported advantages of the gas engine’s inefficiency is its waste heat that’s an impressive result.

There’s an interesting Technology Connections video about the dangers of “but sometimes” lines of argumentation that claims inefficient systems sometimes have accidental advantages which I think applies here. Yes electric cars sometimes have to provide heat in a way that’s less efficient than gas-powered cars but only sometimes.

Moreover even when that happens they’re still much more efficient overall than internal combustion engined cars. According to Fenske he used the equivalent of just 20 gallons of gas averaging 100 MPGe.

For those who are more concerned about charging time than efficiency Fenske spent the same amount of time charging during both summer and winter. That was though helped by his charging strategy. By charging more often from lower battery levels he was able to spend less time than he would have otherwise had.

As everyone who’s charged an electronic device like a cellphone or a laptop knows that’s because the fuller a battery gets the longer it takes to charge. That’s why you see automakers quoting short charging times to 80% whereas topping them up takes considerably longer. So charging less more frequently actually cuts down on charging time though it does add some distance while you get on and off the highway."
TXN,Texas Instruments,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hemNlbnRyYWwuY29tL3N0b3J5L21vbmV5L2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMjEvMDEvMzAvYXZuZXQtaW5jLW1hcmtzLTEwMC15ZWFycy1waGlsLWdhbGxhZ2hlci1uZXctY2VvLXBob2VuaXgtY29tcGFueS82NzAxNjY2MDAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Avnet Inc. marks 100 years; Phil Gallagher is new CEO of Phoenix firm,"When Avnet Inc. moved its global headquarters from suburban New York City to the Valley in 1997 it was a big deal. This was a giant multinational a Fortune 500 mainstay that ultimately set up shop in Phoenix near Sky Harbor International Airport.

Large corporate relocations were uncommon back then and remain so. Avnet instantly became a revenue leader among Arizona-based corporations moving billions of dollars worth of items — semiconductors computers software sensors motors cables and much more — each year from manufacturers to business-end users around the globe. Many of those items ultimately wind up in homes offices or garages.

But as the electronics distributor celebrates its 100th anniversary this year the company doesn't have quite the buzz it used to. A new CEO hopes to improve on that.

A key step will be getting Avnet back on a consistent profit track after logging two annual losses in the last three fiscal years. Sales are well below where they were compared to a few years ago and the company's Arizona employment is actually down by roughly 1000 over the past several years to around 1400 people.

Avnet's stock price also has declined in recent years despite a steady rise in the overall market and better results for some competitors.

Part of the recent sluggishness reflects the COVID-19 pandemic which has slowed orders disrupted the workforce and caused other problems.

""We all took a hit this time a year ago but it's bouncing back"" said Phil Gallagher the 37-year company veteran who in November was officially named Avnet's CEO — the third in a span of four-and-a-half years.

But there were other problems too including the loss of Texas Instruments last year as a major supplier. Avnet will need to find other business to fill the 10% or so of sales that the TI distribution agreement delivered. Avnet has historically relied on acquisitions — of other distributors software companies hardware designers technical-support firms manufacturing consultants and more — to pave its trajectory and it might need more of the same going forward.

Analyst Brian Colello at investment researcher Morningstar projects a 6% revenue drop in Avnet's current fiscal year that ends in June a 9% rebound in 2022 and then annual growth averaging 4% over the next three years. Solid perhaps but far from spectacular.

Avnet had averaged roughly $530 million in annual net income over eight years from 2010 through 2017 before hitting the latest rough stretch with revenue also dropping in part due to the 2017 sale of its Technology Solutions group. (Avnet received $2.4 billion and a 7% stake in acquirer Tech Data.) Despite a 50% jump in recent months Avnet shares still trade about where they did eight years ago.

Avnet's long-term staying power

Still Avnet has survived other rough patches before. Very few companies have made it to their 100th birthday Gallagher noted especially in Arizona.

However Avnet mostly didn't grow up with Arizona which gained statehood 109 years ago next month. The company got its start as a storefront seller of radio parts and other electronics products in lower Manhattan shortly after World War I.

""People would come in and make their own radios"" said Dale Rogers an Arizona State University professor in supply-chain management. ""They were kind of like an old Radio Shack"" he said. ""But that wasn't a great business and not one that would last long.""

Two big companies emerged from that era — Avnet and Arrow Electronics a larger corporation that remains a key competitor. Avnet incorporated in 1955 and the company's growth said Rogers really ramped up during the 1960s when visionary leaders began to made a slew of acquisitions.

Today Avnet is a multinational player that derives about 75% of its sales in foreign nations. It still makes acquisitions — 68 from 2000 through 2020 for instance.

""We distribute hundreds of product lines"" said Gallagher. ""Everything from thermostats in your home and watches to track your heart rate to alarm systems for cars.""

In 1997 Avnet moved west by relocating its headquarters to Phoenix under then-CEO Leon Machiz and his successor Roy Vallee who was a prominent Valley business leader for more than a decade. The company's headquarters are in a facility southeast of Sky Harbor International Airport. Its largest physical presence though in Arizona or anywhere is a 400000-square-foot warehouse in Chandler.

Several factors precipitated the company's headquarters move here in 1997: favorable weather a modest cost of living the ability to attract talent the presence of several other Avnet facilities in the area and proximity to Intel Motorola and other large suppliers.

2.1 million customers in 140 countries

Avnet mainly serves high-volume business customers especially those in the automotive medical defense and aerospace industries. Semiconductors make up about 75% of its sales.

""They have an important role to play for their customers to make sure the stuff is good"" said Rogers. ""They're really good at getting products when you need them.""

Manufacturers of electronic components he added often don't do such a superb job with distribution.

One area of growth has been the Internet of Things which describes the increased connectivity and data sharing among all sorts of items from household appliances to factory equipment.

""The applications are becoming much more pervasive and we're right in the middle of it"" said Gallagher. ""We also have engineers who help design products."" They and other Avnet employees help customers reduce the time cost and complexities of bringing products to market.

Avnet counts around 1400 suppliers and 2.1 million customers and does business in more than 140 countries. It had about 14600 employees as of mid-2020 though that was down nearly 1000 from the prior year.

Despite the loss of Texas Instruments and other key supplier relationships ""Avnet retains significant market share in electronic-components distribution which we expect to continue"" wrote Morningstar analyst Colello in a report last year. ""The firm has been plagued with a handful of recent supplier losses but we think it will rebound.""

He predicts the Internet of Things will be a tailwind for Avnet but he also views the shares as currently overvalued.

Company stays open amid pandemic

Gallagher a former college football player a defensive nose guard at West Chester University who grew up in the Philadelphia area is entrusted with moving the ball forward.

He said enters the office around 6:30 to 7 a.m. and works 12 to 14 hour days. Much of his time is spent in meetings with stock analysts and larger suppliers and customers. ""You can get sucked into everything"" he said especially given Avnet's round-the-clock operations.

""When I go home at night Asia is waking up"" he said. ""When I wake up Europe's already up.""

Gallagher said he has traditionally traveled extensively in his various previous positions with the company. ""I still believe relationships matter"" he said of his many meetings including those outside standard work hours. ""Dinner and a glass of wine.""

Like many other companies Avnet has practiced social distancing at its facilities with much staff working from home. ""We're back to 25 to 50% in the office but rotating employees"" Gallagher said.

Still the pandemic didn't shut down Avnet. ""There wasn't one day when we didn't ship products"" he said.

Need for continuous reinvention

Results for Avnet's most recent quarter ending Jan. 2 showed marked improvement over weak year-earlier results. Net income of $19.2 million on sales of $4.67 billion surpassed the earlier profit of $3.7 million on sales of $4.53 billion.

Gallagher talks of ""getting back to the fundamentals"" such as further solidifying relationships with suppliers growing the company's market share and meeting shareholder expectations. ""We're definitely going down the right path"" he said.

Rogers also thinks Avnet would benefit by getting back to its roots more and becoming more agile.

""Avnet really got built during the '60s"" he said. ""Visionary leadership went out and acquired a bunch of pieces. That hasn't been the case as much lately.""

Making shrewd acquisitions and other strategic decisions isn't easy though as it's difficult to determine what might be a billion-dollar business line in five or 10 years Rogers added. He cited the spectacular growth of cell phones as an example though not one that applies particularly to Avnet.

""Some of the leadership it seems hasn't been as good at seeing the future"" he said. ""You really have to reinvent yourself in the electronics industry continuously.""

He’s one of the most prolific inventors in the world. He holds over 1335 US patents more than the inventor of the electric bulb Thomas Alva Edison (1093 patents). And he was awarded IEEE’s prestigious Andrew S Grove award in 2018 for his contributions to the technology that is used to produce integrated circuits.

Gurtej was born in London to parents specialising in chemistry. The family moved to Punjab when Gurtej was three and that’s where Gurtej grew up. He graduated in electrical engineering from IIT Delhi and then did a PhD in physics from the University of North Carolina.

In December 1990 immediately after his PhD he joined US chipmaker Micron Technology. And that’s where he still is. He is today senior fellow and vice president of advanced process technology responsible for Micron’s R&D roadmaps. He has pioneered several process technologies being currently employed in mainstream semiconductor chip manufacturing. His work has enabled the continuation of Moore’s Law for aggressive scaling of memory chips integral to consumer electronics products and solid-state drives.

Gurtej is convinced it’s all karma. Working on memory chips was the last thing on his mind in his student days. “It was a series of small accidents and decisions that got me here. I felt it was too late for me to get into silicon as it was already a mature industry and during grad school I was working on building a device using diamond as a substrate and that’s what I thought I wanted to do.”

But he ended up applying to Micron. “While browsing through an issue of IEEE Spectrum I found an ad for a job at Micron sent my resume and got selected. I realised later it was a two-year-old issue of the magazine.”

Micron was then a small company. A career in Intel Texas Instruments or IBM was more tempting. But his physics professor who was with IBM before joining academics told him “If you go to a large company they’ll put you in a box.”

So Gurtej went to Micron with a two-year plan. “But I was meant to work with Micron one way or the other because one of the companies that I had got an offer from Texas Instruments decided to exit the memory business which Micron ended up buying” he says.

If you join a big company he says you sort of get lost in the crowd but if you join a smaller company you can learn a lot.",,,,,,,,,

Nonetheless America must always be prepared for that eventuality even if the chances of such an unwanted confrontation coming to pass are incredibly slight.

To that end the American military is now considering what to purchase as its new helicopters and in the running as a lead contender is the Defiant X an aircraft with all the bells and whistles pilots in battle could hope for at the beginning of a new century. Its prototype was designed and manufactured by Sikorsky & Boeing Company. The firm is up against rival defence manufacturer Bell Textron which has submitted a new 280 Valor helicopter. The winning bid will be announced in 2022.

The Defiant X has several features the U.S. military has asked for most notably the speed at which the aircraft can fly. One company spokesman noted that it will fly twice the distance at twice the speed a profound improvement over the helicopters currently used the Black Hawks and the AH-64 Apache attack aircraft among others.

Another improvement according to Boeing sales and marketing representative Heather McBryan is that “we’ve made some… enhancements to the design to help reduce thermal signature and improve (the) aerodynamic handling.” In layman’s terms that means the helicopter will be easier to maneuver.

Company officials have not said just how fast the Defiant X can fly but last fall it was clocked at well over 200 knots in test flights. Test pilots put in more than 25 hours in actual tests and about 1500 hours of simulations.

Sikorsky designed the Black Hawk which gave the firm a “leg up” when it came time to design the new aircraft. Designers have incorporated all the positive design elements of the old helicopter into the new and added plenty more features on the military’s “wish list.”

One of its most crucial features is its ability to last as demand – and conflict scenarios – change. McBryan added in a recent press release “This is really designed for growth and so out in the 2030s as missions change and threats change there is that growth capability.”

The Defiant X is one of the aircraft in the Future Long Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) program. This design specifically has been “optimized” according to company officials and will be well equipped to respond to changing environments for several decades yet to come.

If the Black Hawk’s history is any indication it seems likely that the American military will choose to replace these venerable machines with the new Defiant X although no one can predict this with certainty.

The Black Hawk has been the go-to helicopter of choice for the American military for more than four decades and not solely for combat missions. They are also used in medical evacuations and for transport of important military personnel.

This aircraft was named for an early 19th century Native American leader named Black Hawk renowned for his bravery and fighting skills. He was one of the top people in the Sauk Tribe which today lives mainly in areas of Minnesota.

His namesake helicopter has seen battle in places like Iraq and has been part of special operations in places like Panama. It is considered one of the finest aircraft in the fleet in U.S. aviation.

Whether the Defiant X will replace the Black Hawk remains to be seen. But if it contains all the latter’s strengths with some brand new technology and speed the odds seem to be in its favour and Sikorsky Boeing’s.",,,,,,

It will soon be filled with businesses and houses. (Progressive Farmer image by Matthew Putney)

The world will lose about 250 million crop-production acres by 2050 according to estimates from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.

The possibility of losing the equivalent of roughly two-thirds of the cultivated land in the United States is alarming says Jerry Hatfield director of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Laboratory for Agriculture and the Environment in Ames Iowa. But he believes it can be prevented.

Hatfield says urbanization and soil degradation from excessive tillage and other farming practices are largely to blame for lost farm and ranchlands.

If society doesn't do a better job making land-use decisions and taking care of the soil he is afraid hunger and food insecurity will be much more prevalent in 30 years when the world's population is expected to top 9 billion.

""To improve the stability of agriculture production going forward we will have to improve and protect our soils"" Hatfield continues.

The American Farmland Trust (AFT) a nonprofit organization committed to the protection of farmland recently released ""Farms Under Threat: The State of the States."" The multiyear study identifies farm and ranchland acres lost to development and ways to protect it.

From 2001 to 2016 11 million acres of agricultural land were paved over converted or fragmented according to the study. Roughly 4.4 million acres were classified as ""nationally significant"" or the best land for food and crop production.",,,,,,,,,,,,

UPDATE: Regarding the civil penalty fine structure for individuals who violate the Security Directive TSA will recommend a fine ranging from $250 for the first offense up to $1500 for repeat offenders. Based on substantial aggravating or mitigating factors TSA may seek a sanction amount that falls outside these ranges. TSA has provided transportation system operators specific guidance on how to report violations so that TSA may issue penalties to those who refuse to wear a face mask.

WASHINGTON – The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) will implement provisions of President Biden’s Executive Order on Promoting COVID-19 Safety in Domestic and International Travel by requiring travelers to wear face masks when they are in airports bus and rail stations as well as while on passenger aircraft public transportation passenger railroads and over-the-road buses operating on scheduled fixed-routes. TSA’s action will also support the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Emergency Order requiring that individuals wear masks on conveyances and at stations ports or similar transportation hubs.

Starting on February 2 2021 TSA will require individuals to wear a mask at TSA airport screening checkpoints and throughout the commercial and public transportation systems. This requirement will remain effective until May 11 2021.

“TSA will fully comply with the President’s Executive Orders CDC guidance and the DHS National Emergency determination to ensure healthy and secure travel across all transportation sectors. This will help prevent further spread of COVID-19 and encourage a unified government response” said Darby LaJoye Senior Official Performing the Duties of the TSA Administrator. “As we continue to experience impacts from this pandemic we are committed to this measure as the right thing to do for the TSA workforce for our industry stakeholders and for passengers.”

The federal face mask requirement extends to the nation’s domestic network of airports; passengers and crewmembers flying aboard airplanes operated by domestic and foreign air carriers with inbound flights to U.S. ports of entry; and surface transportation modes such as passenger rail bus systems and over-the-road bus companies. Passengers without a mask may be denied entry boarding or continued transport. Failure to comply with the mask requirement can result in civil penalties.

Whether beginning the security screening process at the airport Travel Document Checker (TDC) or submitting checked baggage for screening all passengers who appear to be over the age of 2 must properly wear a face mask throughout the security screening process. The officer at the TDC will request that travelers temporarily lower the mask to verify their identity. Those who approach the TDC without a mask will be asked to wear or obtain one to proceed. Passengers who refuse to wear a mask will not be permitted to enter the secure area of the airport which includes the terminal and gate area. Depending on the circumstance those who refuse to wear a mask may be subject to a civil penalty for attempting to circumvent screening requirements interfering with screening personnel or a combination of those offenses.

According to the CDC Order face masks should cover the nose and mouth and fit snugly against the sides without gaps. Masks can be either manufactured or homemade and should be a solid piece of material without slits exhalation valves or punctures. While medical masks and N-95 respirators fulfill CDC and TSA’s requirements face shields and/or goggles are not an acceptable substitute for the use of a mask; however they may be used in addition to an acceptable mask.

In developing implementing guidance TSA collaborated with stakeholders in identifying certain exemptions to the face mask requirement. Exemptions include travelers under the age of 2 years old those with a disability who cannot wear a mask or cannot safely wear a mask because of the disability as defined by the Americans with Disabilities Act and those for whom a mask would create a risk to workplace health safety or job duty as determined by relevant workplace safety guidelines or federal regulations. Visit TSA.gov for more information about face mask requirements.

TSA Cares is a helpline that provides airline passengers with disabilities medical conditions and other special circumstances additional assistance during the airport security screening process. Call them at (855) 787-2227 about 72 hours prior to traveling with any questions about screening policies procedures and what to expect at the security checkpoint.

All commuters and airline travelers including persons considering international travel should first check the CDC website prior to taking their trip.

Throughout the pandemic TSA has closely coordinated COVID-19 safeguards with industry stakeholders federal partners and local law enforcement. This coordination will continue for swift and consistent implementation of this requirement across the transportation network.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvdG9tbXliZWVyLzIwMjEvMDEvMzAvY2RjLW9yZGVyLW1ha2VzLW5vdC13ZWFyaW5nLWEtbWFzay1vbi1wdWJsaWMtdHJhbnNwb3J0YXRpb24tYS1mZWRlcmFsLWNyaW1lL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,CDC—No Longer Constrained By Trump—Issues Order That Makes Not Wearing A Mask On Public Transportation A ...,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/tommybeer/2021/01/30/cdc-order-makes-not-wearing-a-mask-on-public-transportation-a-federal-crime/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvdG9tbXliZWVyLzIwMjEvMDEvMzAvY2RjLW9yZGVyLW1ha2VzLW5vdC13ZWFyaW5nLWEtbWFzay1vbi1wdWJsaWMtdHJhbnNwb3J0YXRpb24tYS1mZWRlcmFsLWNyaW1lL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ibmEuYmgvZW4vVHJhdmVsZXJzcmVhY2hHZXJtYW55ZnJvbW11dGF0ZWR2aXJ1c2FyZWFzZGVzcGl0ZWVudHJ5YmFuLmFzcHg_Y21zPXE4Rm1GSmdpc2NMMmZ3SXpPTjElMkJEZ3JxMjFJSjdGZzBsZHBBb09mTnpLZyUzRNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Travelers reach Germany from mutated virus areas despite entry ban,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.bna.bh/en/TravelersreachGermanyfrommutatedvirusareasdespiteentryban.aspx?cms=q8FmFJgiscL2fwIzON1%2BDgrq21IJ7Fg0ldpAoOfNzKg%3D on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ibmEuYmgvZW4vVHJhdmVsZXJzcmVhY2hHZXJtYW55ZnJvbW11dGF0ZWR2aXJ1c2FyZWFzZGVzcGl0ZWVudHJ5YmFuLmFzcHg_Y21zPXE4Rm1GSmdpc2NMMmZ3SXpPTjElMkJEZ3JxMjFJSjdGZzBsZHBBb09mTnpLZyUzRNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmt1bmEubmV0Lmt3L0FydGljbGVEZXRhaWxzLmFzcHg_aWQ9Mjk1NzIzOCZMYW5ndWFnZT1lbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,KUNA : Kuwaiti Min. inspects latest health procedures at Kuwait Airport - Transport - 31/01/2021,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.kuna.net.kw', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /ArticleDetails.aspx?id=2957238&Language=en (Caused by SSLError(SSLError(1, '[SSL: UNSAFE_LEGACY_RENEGOTIATION_DISABLED] unsafe legacy renegotiation disabled (_ssl.c:1006)'))) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmt1bmEubmV0Lmt3L0FydGljbGVEZXRhaWxzLmFzcHg_aWQ9Mjk1NzIzOCZMYW5ndWFnZT1lbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",,,

Two other staff members are quickly packaging weighing and labeling the cuts. The meat will be sold in no time.

“We’ve been fortunate to be busy. Since the pandemic we are extremely busy” Rinnels said.

Slaughter operations like Orly’s are booming as many large meatpacking plants across the country were closed or drastically slowed down due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A soaring demand for beef and a crippled supply chain caused the traditional farm-to-fork cycle to derail.

Farmers and meat-lovers began to find alternatives leaving meat lockers in Northeast Iowa and across the Midwest overwhelmed and forced to turn away farmers. Rinnels’ schedule is so full he can’t take new beef processing appointments until 2022.

Weakest link Last spring large meatpacking facilities became hotspots for COVID-19. The virus took advantage of crowded work spaces and employees afraid of losing their jobs. It quickly ravaged workforces shutting down plants and significantly slowing down others.

Two of the seven largest U.S. facilities — those with the capacity to process 5000 beef cattle daily — were closed temporarily because of the pandemic according to the Washington Post.

Iowa Premium plant in Tama owned by National Beef Packing Co. suspended production for a week and had 177 out of more than 500 workers tested positive for coronavirus.

An order given on April 28 by former President Donald Trump classified meat processors as critical infrastructure and forced workers back to the production line.

By April temporary plant closures and a hollowed out workforce reduced beef production by more than a third according to the Wall Street Journal.

Production slowed creating a bottleneck. Farmers still had a steady supply of animals ready for processing but nowhere to go with them. Grocers were left with sparse — even bare — meat cases forcing consumers on the hunt for beef to turn elsewhere.

Where’s the beef? Grocery stores like Hy-Vee and Fareway began to ration beef sales. On May 5 Wendy’s fast food chain had stopped serving beef hamburgers at about 20% of its 5500 U.S. restaurants. Some Subway restaurants temporarily eliminated beef from their menu.

Management at SingleSpeed Brewing Co. in Waterloo reported their cost for beef also spiked.

Ground beef prices increased by 184% from May 2019 to May 2020 and beef eye round prices shot up 264%.

Upcharges for food with beef products are reported at other area restaurants.

“We didn’t have trouble getting it but we also were making probably less than 40% of the amount of food we were making the year before” said General Manager Ana Hanisch.

Customers’ demand for beef sent many straight to the source — farmers. Local farmers began to see double and triple sales of whole half and quarter cows.

Crystal Blin co-owner of JJB Cattle Co. in Independence never thought she’d see a shortage of beef at the grocery store. This is after all Iowa.

“It was a supply chain issue “she said. “There wasn’t a shortage of animals. ... The supply chain that had been built up over the last few decades was disrupted.”

The spike in direct-to-consumer beef sales prompted the Iowa Farm Bureau Federation in August to launch a farm-to-table webinar series to assist farmers.

Dan and Lynn Bolin owners of New Day Dairy in Clarskville signed up for the webinar after they began selling retired dairy cows to be processed as ground beef.

“We realized there was a need in our community” Lynn Bolin said.

At first the Bolins had no problem getting appointments at Orly’s meat locker to process the cows. In April Lynn booked an appointment for three weeks away. By May they discovered Orly’s was booked three months out. Today the locker’s 2021 calendar is full and booking is a year out.

“I have the cow and I have the customer” Lynn Bolin said “but there’s an in-between piece that’s missing. There’s not a place that animal can be turned into something they can eat.”

The story is the same at the Elma Meat Locker. Owner Roger Meirick said the locker has been in the family since 1937 and he has never seen such high demand for local beef. Retail business doubled for several months last summer as customers were frantically buying beef and other meat in bulk. Sales spiked and have since leveled off but are still about 50% higher than usual he said.

Meirick added a handful of part-time staff to keep up with demand noting too that processing has become more difficult as animals grew overweight while farmers waited for processing appointments.

“We were essential and people needed us” Meirick said.

Back on the farm The Blins at JJB Cattle in Independence stopped waiting for meat lockers to catch up.

“That part of our business is just not going to happen this year” Crystal Blin said of farm-to-consumer beef sales. “The demand is there but we can’t get any spots.”

Because of the bottleneck the Blins found themselves with extra calves that will likely be sold to a feed lot program. Those programs sell beef to grocery stores and restaurants.

“Whether you buy beef from us directly or you buy beef from the grocery store you are still supporting farmers” she said.

SVB Financial Group (SIVB.Q -40.00%) the holding company of Silicon Valley Bank capped off a tremendous year with a great fourth quarter continuing the momentum the company rode throughout 2020. The stock grew about 55% during the year and is currently trading around $440 per share or almost 300% of tangible book value. Diluted earnings per share for the full year came in at $22.87 up more than 5% from record earnings in 2019.

While the bank trades at a rich valuation compared to the industry it's uniquely situated to continue to thrive in the current environment. Let's take a look at what led to the success and what to expect from the bank in 2021.

Strong loan growth

Silicon Valley Bank is a niche bank catering to the start-up venture capital and private equity communities which are very good sectors to be in right now. The bank has always had great expense management and excellent credit quality. But growth in its various business lines in 2020 powered the bank through higher credit costs and the low-rate environment stemming from the coronavirus pandemic.

During 2020 Silicon Valley Bank saw its balance sheet balloon from $71 billion in total assets at the start of the year to more than $115 billion at the end. As with most banks a big part of this growth can be attributed to the massive amount of deposits that flooded into the banking system. But unlike most of the industry Silicon Valley Bank also experienced robust loan growth of more than 36% in 2020 finding the ability to grow loans outside of those originated in the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). Despite pressure from the low-rate environment on the bank's net interest margin the difference between what the bank makes on interest-earning assets such as loans and pays out on interest-bearing liabilities such as deposits the bank grew net interest income in 2020.

The big driver of the loan growth came from Silicon Valley Bank's global funds banking division which provides banking products such as short-term lines of credit to private equity and venture capital funds. That group saw close to $8 billion of loan growth in 2020 due to record levels of dry powder in the private markets as investors starved for returns had limited areas to turn to.

Fee income surged

Although the bank's net interest income growth in 2020 impressed fee income growth surpassed it growing by more than 50% in 2020 compared to 2019 and reaching more than $1.8 billion on the year.

At the very beginning of January of 2019 Silicon Valley Bank acquired the Boston investment bank Leerink which specializes in innovation industries including healthcare biotechnology pharmaceuticals medical devices diagnostic and life science tools healthcare services and digital health. The move has paid dividends as the division benefited from lots of initial public offerings in 2020 and generated nearly $414 million of revenue up roughly 112% from 2019.

Additionally because it interacts so much with the start-up and venture capital communities Silicon Valley Bank has its own venture capital arm through which it invests money from mostly third-party investors in start-ups and funds that essentially invest in other venture capital funds. This business generates non-interest income through investment returns carried interest and management fees.

In 2020 the venture capital arm generated more than $237 million in net gains up about 72% from 2019. The main boosts to this business were start-ups or companies in which Silicon Valley Bank had an interest going public or getting acquired resulting in gains on investment securities or warrants.

Another strong year ahead in 2021

After such a strong year in 2020 you might be wondering if the bank can continue the momentum in 2021. All signs would indicate that it can. Management previously projected that net interest income is expected to grow in the high-single-digit percentages this year which would be strong in the low-rate environment. The bank also added 1500 more clients in the fourth quarter ranging from individuals to private equity and venture capital firms to start-ups. This provides more customers for the bank's loans and other banking products.

Additionally Silicon Valley Bank recently acquired Boston Private Financial Holdings. The acquisition is immediately beneficial to earnings and tangible book value and it will help build out the bank's wealth management business. Boston Private comes with more than $16 billion in assets under management and an advanced technology platform that should help Silicon Valley Bank cross-sell banking products to its huge and wealthy client base. The continued loan growth and expansion of the private bank are just two of the reasons to be excited about Silicon Valley Bank this year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vb2JpdHMuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9kYWxsYXNtb3JuaW5nbmV3cy9uYW1lL21hcmdhcmV0LXJvZ2Vycy1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD03MzY3NDM00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Margaret Rogers Obituary (1938 - 2021) - Dallas TX - Dallas Morning News,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://obits.dallasnews.com/us/obituaries/dallasmorningnews/name/margaret-rogers-obituary?id=7367434 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vb2JpdHMuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9kYWxsYXNtb3JuaW5nbmV3cy9uYW1lL21hcmdhcmV0LXJvZ2Vycy1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD03MzY3NDM00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpLmNvbS9uZmwvbGlvbnMvbmV3cy9saW9ucy1tYXR0aGV3LXN0YWZmb3JkLWJlc3QtZm91cnRoLXF1YXJ0ZXItY29tZWJhY2tz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Matthew Stafford 3 Best Fourth-Quarter Comebacks Detroit Lions,"Read more on Matthew Stafford's three best fourth-quarter comebacks with the Detroit Lions

The Matthew Stafford era in Motown has officially come to an end.

He produced a variety of great memories during his 12 years donning Honolulu Blue -- and perhaps none better than his 31 fourth-quarter comebacks including his NFL record eight fourth-quarter comebacks during the 2016 season.

Let's take a look now at Stafford's three best come-from-behind performances in his tenure with the Lions.

Matthew Stafford gets it done in Minnesota with assist from Golden Tate

Let's start this countdown off with the best Stafford fourth-quarter comeback from his historic 2016 season.

In Detroit's first ever contest at U.S. Bank Stadium (Week 9 of the '16 campaign) the Lions were trailing the Vikings 16-13 with 0:23 to go after a one-yard rushing touchdown from then-Minnesota fullback Rhett Ellison.

After a touchback on the kickoff from Minnesota Detroit started its possession on its own 20-yard line.

Stafford completed two passes -- one to now N.Y. Giants wide receiver Golden Tate and another to ex-Lions wideout Andre Roberts -- that put the Lions at the Vikings' 40-yard line.

Matt Prater then sunk a 58-yard field goal to force overtime.

Stafford & Co. got the ball to start the OT session and never let the Vikings get it in their hands.

Stafford led Detroit on an 11-play 74-yard drive that ended with this impressive 28-yard reception TD from Tate.

Tate found a way to stay in bounds as he tiptoed along the sideline and then leaped into the end zone for the game-winning score.

It was the best Stafford come-from-behind performance during his memorable '16 season and the third best of his career with the Lions.

His comeback against the Cleveland Browns in 2009

This was Stafford's first big moment as the starting quarterback of the Detroit Lions. It came in a Week 11 contest against the Browns during his rookie season.

He spearheaded a come-from-behind win in the tilt -- the first fourth-quarter comeback and game-winning drive of his NFL career -- despite having injured his shoulder on the second-to-last play of the final drive.

He refused to leave the game after taking the injury-causing hit from then-Browns defensive lineman C.J. Mosley and got right back under center.

Raj Mehta USA TODAY Sports

On that same play a defensive pass interference penalty was called against Cleveland resulting in one final play for Stafford & Co. with 0:00 on the clock.

Stafford took full advantage of the extra play and found then-Detroit tight end Brandon Pettigrew on a one-yard pass for the game-winning score. It gave the Lions the 38-37 victory and marked Stafford's second career win as an NFL starter.

As I've said before the legend of Matthew Stafford was officially born on this memorable day -- Nov. 22 2009.

The fake spike against the Dallas Cowboys in 2013

This legendary moment in Stafford's career occurred during a Week 8 contest in 2013 against Stafford's hometown squad in the Dallas Cowboys.

You know that Stafford wanted to leave Cowboys owner Jerry Jones with something to remember about his performance. And boy did he do so.

With 1:02 remaining in the contest and Detroit trailing 30-24 Stafford and the Lions gained possession after a 44-yard field goal from then-Dallas kicker Dan Bailey.

Stafford had a chance to march the Lions down the field for the game-winning touchdown and he proceeded to do just that and in dramatic fashion.

He completed five passes for 79 yards during the drive. Yet the biggest play on this possession wasn't one of the passes.

Instead it was the decision he made after completing a 22-yard pass to Lions great Calvin Johnson which brought the ball to the Dallas one-yard line.

With the clock still running and no timeouts remaining for Detroit Stafford went off script and decided not to spike the ball on the next play. Instead he faked it and took it in himself for the game-deciding TD.

The result was an eruption of pandemonium that swept across Ford Field.

This marked the greatest come-from-behind victory of the comeback king's 12-year run in the Motor City.

Though the pair don’t state outright that they are teasing the actual Super Bowl Uber Eats confirmed that it will be airing a spot during the game.

Over the last year the brand has been humorously mining the idea of famous (but unexpected) duos in its “Tonight I’ll Be Eating"" campaign created with The Special Group. It’s featured matchup ads that paired up sci-fi icons Mark Hamill and Patrick Stewart (aka Star Wars’ Luke Skywalker Star Trek’s Captain Jean-Luc Picard) as well as Olympic Gold medalist Simon Biiles and “Queer Eye” host Jonathan Van Ness.

Since the pandemic began food delivery platforms have been stepping up their marketing and DoorDash too will be running a spot for the first time on Super Bowl Sunday. That ad will also feature some famous faces—Sesame Street’s Cookie Monster and “Hamilton” star Daveed Diggs. While Uber Eats-owned Postmates will not be running an ad in-game it was behind a recent stunt involving three-time Super Bowl champ Jerry Rice who catches a burrito shot from a cannon 100 yards away.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRleGVydG8uY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvbXItYmVhc3QtYmVjb21lcy1hbi11YmVyLWRyaXZlci1hbmQtZ2l2ZXMtZXZlcnktcGFzc2VuZ2VyLWEtZnJlZS1jYXItMTQzOTE3Ni_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mr Beast gives away Lamborghini to Uber passenger,"YouTube’s favorite philanthropist Mr Beast has yet again made dreams come true on his first day as an Uber driver by handing out free cars to the passengers he escorted including a Lamborghini.

22-year-old Mr Beast has become one of the most popular creators on YouTube. Since the start of his YouTube career in 2012 at age 13 he has managed to accumulate over 45 million subscribers just on his main channel alone.

As his success has snowballed the YouTuber (real name Jimmy Donaldson) has been able to facilitate even grander videos with even more insanely expensive gifts for his subscribers family and friends as well as people in need.

While he drove around with his new customers his friends rode behind them in the world’s most conspicuous surveillance van feeding him lines and planning their big reveal. They each took a turn at handing out a car and challenging each other to behave weirdly as the driver to make things a little extra tense.

One passenger did manage to figure out that the driver was Mr Beast but the others were in total shock and awe when they discovered they’d be able to keep the car. One person said they’d give the car to their mom who needed one and another was relieved to receive the car after his had broken down.

The final and arguably the luckiest passenger was grateful just to be picked up in a Lamborghini calling it “surreal.” His disbelief was off the charts when he found out that he’d be able to keep the stunning car.

Ryan Graham 31 was delivering food last weekend to a Haltom City apartment complex and was fatally stabbed in her neck during a robbery police said. The defendants were arrested midweek and their names are withheld because they're juveniles.

The defendants appeared separately for a virtual detention hearing in Tarrant County Juvenile Court. Officials said during the hearing that a confidential informant tipped authorities of the defendants' connection to the murder and their plans to skip town.

Tarrant County Judge Alex Kim said the defendants indicated in an interrogation that they attacked Graham because they were trying to steal her car. When they couldn't find the keys one of them stabbed her in the neck.

“At this point I’m very concerned about the safety of the community if I was to release you” Kim said to one of the defendants during the hearing.

Haltom City investigators said they found evidence linking the two juveniles to the killing and they were arrested in a Fort Worth apartment building. They were taken to the Tarrant County Juvenile Justice Center in Fort Worth.

A resident of the building where the murder occurred told police that he found Graham in the building’s breezeway in the front of his home. Graham did not reach the customer’s door before she was killed and she died on the scene.

Graham who was from Fort Worth was delivering food for Uber Eats as a side job. A GoFundMe page raising money for her funeral expenses has exceeded the $30000 goal reaching more than $55000."

Miranda Westman 26 made her initial appearance Monday for felony charges of grand theft and burglary. According to an affidavit of probable cause obtained by EastIdahoNews.com Westman stole a total of $2418.48 between two separate trips to Ulta Beauty on 25th Street.

Bonneville County Sheriff’s deputies first learned of the theft when they were called to the store on Dec. 24. Westman told deputies she grabbed a total of 99 items on Dec. 22 and 23. Ulta scanned the items which gave them the total amount stolen according to court documents.

The store manager said they found a Facebook group called CandyLand Makeup Sales N More with over 1300 members. In a report deputies said Westman her husband and two other people were the operators. A search of the Facebook group showed the sale of items similar to the ones stolen dating back to Sept. 21 2020.

Westman said she and her husband were going through financial difficulties after her husband had been laid off in September or October.

Investigators checked Westman’s criminal history which included a prior theft in Oregon earlier that year. Court records in Oregon show Westman was charged with a misdemeanor pleaded not guilty but then failed to show up to a court appearance in September.

Westman was not arrested on the Idaho charges but issued a summons to appear in court.

Abstract prints in reds yellows and blues were worked into dresses — vaporous goddess shapes in chiffon or statuesque suiting in taffeta. Embroideries and macramé lace brought a sense of lightness by revealing a sliver of skin down the leg in the folds of a caped jumpsuit or tumbling down shoulders.

Tulle skirts spelled sweet romance and commanding presence depending on their length while long floaty printed dresses served as transitional outfits between airy evenings and glamorous daytime. Elsewhere peplum jackets chic trousers and tailored Bermuda shorts — a novelty this season — elevated daytime options for a well-heeled clientele whose lifestyle is an endless ballet of occasions to dress up.

The 25-year-old Michigan State University graduate shared her first ever IGTV video to her Instagram page on Jan. 29 and it’s absolutely adorable. Not only did her fans get an easy to follow make-up tutorial – she finished the 12 minute video with some hilarious bloopers.

Hailie who boasts over 2 million followers on Instagram is usually fairly reserved when it comes to her social media presence. But in her new video which is by far the longest one she’s ever shared her personality shining through like never before. She poked fun at herself for saying “there’s only one more step left” asking “why am I saying there’s only one more step left.” When she messed it up a second time Hailie couldn’t help but laugh and make a funny face.

Her fans couldn’t get enough of the video or the bloopers and left plenty of encouraging comments. One fan wrote: “Love the blooper reel at the end!” Another encouraged her to start a Youtube channel for her make-up tutorials and wrote: “honestlyyyyyyy like I stg I would watch every video.”

Her fans may get their wish to see more of Hailie because in her comment she teased that she might soon start her own channel. “I think youtubes right around the corner” she wrote.

Hailie also used her caption to list and link every single product she used to create her gorgeous everyday look so her fans can totally copy her right down to her lip liner.

She started her look with “Smashbox Halo Tinted Moisturizer” which retails for $36.00 at ULTA Beauty. With Hailie’s fair complexion it’s a great choice for her. She used a foundation brush to apply it all over her face and then blended it to a flawless finish with a beauty blender.

Next she applied “Revlon PhotoReady Candid Concealer” under hear eyes on the bridge of her nose in the center of her forehead and on her chin. The affordable concealer is available at Target for $5.99.

Hailie followed it up with a setting powder and told fans she always sets her make-up because she doesn’t want to “crease.” She applied “Maybelline Fit Me Matte & Powerless Powder” which retails for $7.99 all over her face using a large powder brush. “I’m going to lightly brush it all over my face and really pat it into the areas that I crease which are my smile lines and under my eyes” she explained.

After setting her face she used the “Anastasia Beverly Hills Contour Kit” available at ULTA Beauty for $40.00 to contour her entire face.

To do her eyes and eyebrows Hailie opted for the “Anastasia Beverly Hills Brow Powder Duo” in soft brown available at ULTA Beauty for $23.00. First she used the powder to create a winged eyeliner. Then she used it to fill in her perfectly arched brows.

For added eyebrow oomph she brushed on “Almay Brow Styler Brow Mascara” which retails for $6.99. Then she did her eyelashes with “Covergirl LashBlast Volume Mascara” which is a great deal at just $9.99.

Hailie saved her lips for last and used a “Mac Lip Pencil” in the color “Oak” at a cost of $18.00 to line and fill them. And then she layered on “Revlon Ultra HD Matte Lip Color” in the color “Seduction” which retails for $9.99.

Hailie explained that these are the makeup products she uses for a “medium coverage” look. “If I was going full glam there would have been eyelashes eye shadow full coverage foundation probably a bit more aggressive with the contour and the powder” she told her followers.

After wishing her fans a “good weekend” Hailie shared her endearing bloopers reel which surely put a smile on many of her followers’ faces.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBlbmluc3VsYWRhaWx5bmV3cy5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvamNwZW5uZXktYmVnaW5zLWxpcXVpZGF0aW9uLW9mLXN0b3JlLWFmdGVyLTI2LXllYXJzLWluLXNlcXVpbS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,JCPenney begins liquidation of store after 26 years in Sequim,"Sales to continue through tentative closure in mid-May

Liquidation of the Sequim JCPenney began on Jan. 21 and will last tentatively through mid-May after the store’s corporate leaders announced its closure in December. JCPenney opened in Sequim in 1995 in the former Safeway building. Matthew Nash/Olympic Peninsula News Group

SEQUIM — JCPenney in Sequim a retail staple for 26-plus years has began liquidation and plans to permanently close its doors in mid-May.

The sale at the store at 651 Washington St. started more than a month after staff learned of the store’s impending closure Dec. 10.

Moments upon entering the store Jan. 21 customers were saying the closure is “heartbreaking” and “terrible.”

“This is bad; we need this store” another customer said.

General Manager Beverly Nelson said progressive sales are starting at 20-50 percent and all sales will be final.

It’s still to be determined if employees will transfer to other stores following the closure Nelson said.

Susan Erdman of Port Angeles has worked on the store floor for 17 years worked for two general managers and met “a lot of great people” she said.

“It’s been a good store for Sequim” Erdman said. “People are going to miss it. They’ve been telling us ‘Where are we going to shop? What are we going to do now?’ ”

Sequim’s closure follows a “store optimization strategy” from new owners Simon Property Group and Brookfield Asset Management Inc. reporting plans to close up to 200 stores for financial restructuring following the retailer filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2020.

The Sequim JCPenney is the only one on the North Olympic Peninsula.

The next closest store is at the Kitsap Mall in Silverdale.

Sequim JCPenney moved from Port Angeles to the former Sequim Safeway store in 1995 at the Sequim Village Shopping Center.

Prior to the liquidation the store employed 35 part-time and full-time employees.

Salon

Some employees have moved on to other employment including all but one stylist at the JCPenney Styling Salon. Salon manager Rebecca Claymore will remain with the store as long as the salon remains open with the timeline unknown she said.

Last week she took remaining vacation time and she will be open this week for appointments from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday-Friday by stopping in or calling 360-681- 4047.

The last two stylists finished Jan. 15 Claymore said and all her stylists found local positions.

“People who knew the salon was closing called to see how we’re doing and if they could offer employment” she said. “It made me feel so good and it speaks well for this salon.”

Claymore said she loves the people who worked there and she’s “heard a lot of healing words from customers.”

She made the switch from Silverdale as a master stylist in August to lead the Sequim salon and was sad to learn about the closure a few months later.

With state regulations in place late last year they had to downsize from four to two stylists and from 50 percent to 25 percent capacity.

“We got creative (with hours)” Claymore said.

Store

JCPenney was founded in 1902. Sequim’s store remained open in 2017 after the company closed 138 stores nationwide. However it joins GameStop and Ulta Beauty as franchises to close in the city during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Erdman said in her years with the store she’s “seen a lot of ups and downs” but she plans to stay through the entirety of the closure.

“I have a granddaughter and I’m going to keep taking care of her a few days a week so I don’t want to mess that schedule up” she said.

As for what’s next after the closure Erdman says she’s not going to rush things in finding another job.

Sequim’s store won several corporate awards in recent years including the Chairman’s Award and the Founder’s Award the “highest distinction for excellence” according to JCPenney representatives.

Claymore who commutes from Poulsbo said she loves Sequim.

“It’s beautiful here and I’ve met so many neat people” she said. “I’ve always treated it like a little vacation when I come here.”

Logistics

JCPenney’s website states: “Items purchased prior to the start of the liquidation sale may be returned or exchanged throughout the entire liquidation sale.”

Gift cards from the store can be redeemed but not purchased at the Sequim location.

Notices pinned to bulletin boards throughout the plant in the days prior alerted workers to that much.

That day a Dixie executive from Atlanta was in town. She met with the workers’ union leaders at 7:15 a.m. — 15 minutes after the plant’s third shift ends and its first shift begins — and delivered the news. Then at 7:30 a.m. she spoke to more than 150 employees sitting in chairs separated by 6 feet — a reminder of the pandemic that had chilled demand for the facility’s products. Those who couldn’t attend were notified with a phone call after.

Just after 9 a.m. corporate parent Georgia-Pacific released the news publicly: It was closing its longtime Dixie cup manufacturing plant in Forks Township by the end of 2021 putting 190 people out of work and relocating some of the operation’s equipment to an existing site in Kentucky.

“I was taken by surprise” said Dennis Andrews a printing operator who has worked at the plant for 23 years and four months. “In hindsight you could say there were signs but everybody’s good with hindsight. For me this came out of left field.”

Andrews as financial secretary of United Steelworkers Local 412 heard the news at 7:15 a.m. and then again with the rest of the plant 15 minutes later when he stood in the back while the executive spoke through a microphone. He couldn’t tell you much of what she said at the larger meeting — his hearing isn’t all that good after years running the printing press that stamps designs on the Dixie cups.

What’s clear is the closure will be gradual and effects bargaining between Georgia-Pacific and the union will begin Feb. 8 Andrews said.

Georgia-Pacific will close its Lehigh Valley manufacturing plant in Forks Township by the end of the year the company announced Jan. 15. The plant which sits off Kesslersville Road makes cups under the Dixie name.

The first cuts will come between March 25 and April 7 when 16 hourly employees and one salaried worker will lose their jobs according to a Jan. 21 notice filed with the state to comply with the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act.

Fifty-seven more — 51 hourly six salaried — will be let go between July 21 and Aug. 3. The final 116 workers which includes 104 hourly and 12 salaried employees needed to close the plant and decommission the facility’s assets will lose their jobs sometime between Dec. 15 and Dec. 28.

Wind-downs like this have happened in the Lehigh Valley and beyond before of course ? the decision made by a corporate parent based elsewhere that sees declining demand and opts to consolidate operations to reduce costs and keep pace with rivals. Those plants often were longtime employment hubs places where generations of the same family spent their careers. That was the case at the Forks plant which dates to 1964 and is just one part of Dixie’s long history in the Lehigh Valley.

The pandemic by minimizing public gatherings halting events and forcing many office employees to work from home cut into sales for paper cups and opened the door for Georgia-Pacific to relocate operations under one roof as it attempts to bolster its competitive stance in the industry.

“We’ve seen a decrease in consumption as we’ve all transitioned to how we’re living in the last few months” Georgia-Pacific spokesperson Tom Strother explained. “At the end of the day decisions like this are difficult to make. This was a strategic decision we made based upon the needs of our business and our ability to be competitive long term.”

Or as Andrews said as he tried to make sense of it all: “This is just the numbers. This is all just numbers.”

But in the Lehigh Valley overflowing with industrial activity economic development leaders expressed confidence the Dixie property will be in high demand when it closes. And with many employers in the sector struggling to find talent the hope is many Dixie workers will land on their feet once they are let go.

Way back when

When state Sen. Lisa Boscola heard Georgia-Pacific was closing its Forks manufacturing plant her mind flashed back to a 1999 tour of the facility when it was part of the Fort James Corp.

She remembers that Friday afternoon in August as an exciting day when Fort James touted a $14 million 48-job expansion at its Dixie plant as the company rushed to meet demand for a then-revolutionary product: a disposable cup made of plastic-coated paper that kept coffee hot without scorching the consumer’s hands. McDonald’s was among the big buyers of the cup called the PerfecTouch. The company sent Boscola home with some of its cups that day.

“My husband and I thought they were pretty cool” said Boscola whose district no longer includes the Forks facility. “I remember having those cups in my house and thinking ‘This is so great to have in the Lehigh Valley.'”

The state chipped in $275000 in grants to support that expansion with Fort James planning to use almost half of the 350000-square-foot Forks plant to produce PerfecTouch cups. At the same time the company also invested $14 million to equip its Darlington South Carolina plant to make the cups.

Less than one year later Georgia-Pacific Corp. then better known for its forest and building products announced it was acquiring Fort James for $7.8 billion in cash and stock plus the assumption of $3.5 billion in debt. The deal closed Nov. 27 2000 a major step in the Atlanta company’s push to transform itself into the holder of more consumer name brands such as Quilted Northern Brawny and Dixie.

Analysts at the time predicted few changes for the 450 employees making Dixie cups paper plates and disposable forks knives and spoons at the Forks plant. But the acquisition of Fort James also loaded Georgia-Pacific up with more debt and the company spent the next few years reducing its debt from a peak of $16 billion to $8.7 billion by the end of 2004.

By November 2005 Georgia-Pacific had a deal in place to go private: Koch Industries Inc. was buying the company for $13.2 billion plus the assumption of $7.8 billion in Georgia-Pacific debt.

At that time the Forks plant employed 386 people Morning Call archives show.

Koch Industries based in Wichita Kansas and one of the largest private companies in the United States still owns Georgia-Pacific today.

Under Koch Andrews said the Forks operation’s employment slowly slimmed down over the years. That continued a trend at the site considering the plant once employed 525 and was Northampton County’s 13th-largest employer in 1996 before the 1997 merger of James River Corp. and Fort Howard Corp.

Thinking about the plant now reminds Andrews of the conversations he had when he started there in the late 1990s. The old-timers as he called them would tell him: “Dennis this isn’t like it was.”

Andrews whose previous job was nonunion didn’t think it was so bad.

But now with the plant getting ready to close?

“I find myself as one of the old-timers saying the exact same thing” he said.

What happened?

Andrews usually would take overtime at the plant when it was available. But when the coronavirus pandemic hit in March overtime dried up in the printing department. In fact production at the plant shut down for a few weeks last year as demand slowed for the Dixie to Go/PerfecTouch cup and the snap-on lids.

“As a private company we don’t publish specific production information” said Strother the company spokesperson. “However there has been a decrease in volume some of which is attributable to the global pandemic.”

Industry analysts said paper cup volume has been hit hard especially with many office employees still working from home and no longer picking up their daily cup of joe-to-go. Also Dixie’s PerfecTouch cup is often used in car dealerships repair shops doctor’s offices and other spots where coffee is available to people waiting or working said Charles Gross a senior equity analyst with Morningstar who covers the paper packaging industry including many of Georgia-Pacific’s big competitors.

“Unfortunately closures throughout the U.S. have sharply dried up foot traffic at those ‘water coolers'” said Gross who covers International Paper WestRock and Packaging Corp. of America.

Though the paper packaging business as a whole is steadily growing Gross noted there will be winners and losers in the industry. He also has concerns about long-term demand for disposable products that can be hard to recycle such as the PerfecTouch cup as consumers increasingly focus on sustainable items.

While it’s true that demand is down longtime packaging and forest products analyst Mark Wilde thinks there is more to Georgia-Pacific’s decision to close its Forks plant. Wilde covered Georgia-Pacific when it was a public company and now analyzes Pactiv Evergreen and Graphic Packaging International which also produce paper cups.

“I would be a bit surprised if this short-term issue was the only factor behind the Georgia-Pacific decision” said Wilde of BMO Capital Markets Equity Research. “I think they are always looking at their manufacturing footprint for ways to reduce cost.”

While market conditions matter Strother said Georgia-Pacific also believes having all Dixie cup manufacturing under one roof in Lexington Kentucky will allow it to stay competitive. Once the Forks plant closes all Dixie cups including premium hot cups recycled fiber cups and bath cups will be made at the 550000-square-foot Lexington facility that employs 230 people.

Gross said Georgia-Pacific’s peers also have consolidated facilities over the last decade.

“Ultimately most of these products can be considered ‘commodities’ and it’s a constant race to lower your costs faster than the competition” he said. “Consolidating locations can reduce overhead costs like property taxes or operating lease costs and typically allows some reduction in headcount — one fewer person managing the front desk and fewer accountants and managers per unit of production.”

With work moving to Lexington Georgia-Pacific is planning to add about 50 jobs at that plant. Mike Watson president of Teamsters Local 651 which represents the Lexington workers said the union has started conversations to see if any existing Forks employees want to transfer.

While the company said 230 people work at the Lexington plant Watson said that’s likely including nonunion employees since the Teamsters no longer has that many members at the facility following some cutbacks in the last couple years.

“This announcement that they were closing Lehigh … quite frankly I thought it was going to go the opposite way” Watson said. “We are happy here to a degree because we’re going to get 50 more jobs is what they’re telling me.”

It surprised Andrews too.

He said Georgia-Pacific rolled out a new computer system at the Forks plant in October a technological upgrade that helped the facility better track product and do inventory. He took that as a sign that the company was reinvesting.

Strother said Georgia-Pacific is implementing new business systems at all of its consumer products manufacturing sites which included the Lehigh Valley plant late last year.

Then after all of those months with no extra work available Andrews said he got a weekend of overtime in January.

“I thought things were turning around” he said.

What now?

To Don Cunningham the situation at the Forks facility feels familiar in a way.

He likened it to what unfolded more than five years ago when the Lehigh Valley learned that the longtime Kraft plant would close in Upper Macungie Township costing 415 people their jobs as part of a larger corporate downsizing.

After the Kraft plant closed in November 2016 the property was sold just months later to an Atlanta developer that demolished the plant and built two industrial buildings now a 1.5 million-square-foot manufacturing warehouse and distribution operation for Keurig Dr Pepper.

Cunningham president and CEO of the Lehigh Valley Economic Development Corp. said two manufacturing companies looking to enter the Lehigh Valley market have already expressed interest in Georgia-Pacific’s plant in Forks. In addition he said several area employers hungry for talent are eager to hire any displaced Dixie workers.

“There’s a lot of interest already” Cunningham said. “I just hope the timing lines up.”

For Georgia-Pacific which owns the nearly 36-acre property at 605 Kuebler Road Strother said the company will decide what’s next for the property toward the end of 2021 after cup-making operations have ended.

As for the affected workers like Andrews time will tell what’s next.

Andrews found out recently that his job as a printing operator is going to last until December so he’ll be among the last group of employees to exit the building where he started as a general laborer 23 years and four months ago.

Born and raised in Easton Andrews bought a house in Wilson a year ago and just turned 60 years old. The thought of not having a job is scary he admitted and he’s got another five years or so of work left in his career.

Whatever comes next he said: “It will be union work I guarantee you.”

Now one of the plant’s old-timers he’ll remember the people he worked alongside at the Dixie plant. He’ll remember how they helped one another. He’ll remember how multiple generations of the same family worked at the plant over the years. His aunt and uncle in fact retired from the facility.

“Everyone was there to do a job and it got done and everyone was happy” he said.

But now in 2021 each of the plant’s 190 employees will eventually do their job in Forks one final time. Their last task will occur in March April July August or December and then they’ll leave behind the facility with a giant Dixie cup planted out front.

And the United States has one of the largest automotive markets across the globe. According to Select USA in 2018 the U.S. sales of light vehicles reached 17.2 million units.

1. Autonomous vehicles: The ability to control without human intervention

Autonomous vehicles are anticipated to completely transform the way we commute on roads.

With robust financial assistance regarding continuous R&D and product innovations many of the automotive players are likely to launch consumer-ready autonomous vehicles in the next 10 years. However the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic brought disruption in supply chains and restrictions in the movement of people and goods which resulted in partial or complete stoppage of the research/testing activities. Post-pandemic the autonomous vehicles segment is much anticipated to bounce back and re-set to its ongoing activities.

2. Maglev trains: The demand for faster transport systems across the world

Maglev (magnetic levitation) trains make use of electromagnets for their levitation to generate the push that moves the train at high speeds. In comparison with conventional trains maglev trains have superior controls as their acceleration and braking systems aren’t based on the friction of the railway track.

The demand for faster transport systems is rising in several nations across the world. However the COVID-19 pandemic created adverse economic conditions across the world. Several governments are pouring in huge investments to aid the healthcare systems and reducing investments in other segments. With the COVID-19 vaccine on the horizon disruptions in supply chains and restricted movement of goods and people are expected to resume over the next months while the initiatives for driving the developments of Maglev trains will resume.

3. Autonomous last-mile delivery: Self-driving vehicles to supplement the need for contactless last-mile delivery services

Online retail sales are expected to register tremendous growth while the e-commerce sector is projected to record 15% of the total retail sales in 2020. During the pandemic online sales of existing players are expected to register 10-15% growth in Europe followed by 35% growth in China in 2020. Similarly companies have made investments toward self-driving vehicles to supplement the need for contactless last-mile delivery services.

With the breakthrough in vaccination and when the situation is under control last-mile delivery will certainly not look the same as the companies are preparing for innovation shift after restrictions are lifted to rapidly assess and adapt their supply chains. Such types of innovations have also enabled key players in the autonomous last-mile delivery industry to come up with different techniques to increase business during and after the pandemic.

4. Additive manufacturing: Producing components with complex geometric designs

Additive manufacturing (AM) otherwise known as 3D printing is an innovative approach to industrial production that facilitates the manufacture of stronger and lighter components and systems. Additive manufacturing makes use of computer-aided design (CAD) software or 3D body scanners to command hardware to deposit layer upon layer material in particular geometric profiles. In contrast to the traditional manufacturing processes which involve removing material through machining milling shaping carving or other means additive manufacturing adds the material to create an object. It outclasses all other manufacturing processes in producing components with complex geometric designs and is widely used in creating aerospace parts automotive components and 3D-printed clinical implants for patients and other industries.

The potential applications of additive manufacturing are being acknowledged across a number of different industry verticals. In developed nations where conventional manufacturing has observed a huge decline the advances in additive manufacturing offer valuable prospects for growth. Pre-COVID-19 developments and adoption for 3D printing were aimed at large-scale implementation of 3D-printing manufactured goods. The pandemic caused widespread supply chain disruption and led to the delay in progress related to additive manufacturing. The post-pandemic period is expected to give a push to the developments related with the additive manufacturing market.

5. Micro-mobility: Offering urban transportation

Micro-mobility is a class of lightweight transportation automobiles designed for personal use. Vendors active in the micro-mobility market space are focusing on offering urban transportation that weighs less than 500kg. Electronic scooters e-bikes and electric skateboards are some of the examples of micro-mobility technologies which have become practical in metropolitan cities on account of the rising demand for a practical solution for short-range transportation (less than 8km).

Big tech companies are focusing on the opportunity that micro-mobility transportation offers by creating the software and cloud services required to facilitate the personal and shared micro-mobility start-ups.

6. Solar-powered cars: Major breakthrough in the automotive sector

Solar cars are battery-powered cars that use solar power as their energy source. Solar-powered cars can be a major breakthrough in the automotive sector acting as a carbon-neutral energy-efficient solution. Several automobile players are working toward developing viable solar cars and building solar car kits which can help cars travel longer distances using solar energy.

The automotive industry has faced adverse impacts owing to border closures local lockdowns and the consequent disruption in supply chains. China and India are the major hubs for manufacturing automotive parts across the world but the pandemic led to severe obstacles in the supply of parts. The restrictions in movement of people and materials hampered the industry and led to reduced demand for automobiles. Delays in shipments are being observed across the world. This is impacting solar car production. Cost-effective mechanical and electronic components used in making solar-powered cars are made in Asia and the adverse pandemic conditions have resulted in the delay of shipments. The post-COVID-19 scenario will give an impetus for the growth of the market owing to the rising demand for zero-emission energy-efficient automobiles globally.

7. Flying taxis: Short flights on demand

An air taxi is a small-sized commercial aircraft that makes short flights on demand. Flying taxi is expected to be a third dimension in the urban transportation matrix. Attributed to the rapidly increasing urbanization across the globe the rising demand for quicker modes of transportation is anticipated to be one of the major factors attributing to the fast growth of the market. For journeys more than 20 kilometers flying taxis can emerge as an attractive substitute to a conventional taxi as it can avoid crowded roadways. Big funding rounds are being carried out by the key market players to make superior battery technologies that can be fitted into an air taxi.

The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the delay in R&D and other related initiatives in the development of flying taxis worldwide.

8. Hoverbikes: To reach highly inaccessible areas

Hoverbikes are bikes that can fly and can be immensely useful in search and rescue aerial surveys wildlife and parks powerline inspection and military and emergency applications.

The launch of hoverbikes in the coming years can offer several advantages. For instance the hoverbike would be able to reach some highly inaccessible areas for vehicles running on roads and helicopters. It can also be useful for proving supplies in cases of emergency and used to carry out rescue missions in an effective manner. These factors are driving the growth of the hoverbikes market. However the COVID-19 pandemic adversely impacted growth resulting in the delay in R&D and other related initiatives in the development of hoverbikes worldwide.

9. Predictive vehicle technology: The advent of machine learning in automotive industry

Predictive capabilities are becoming quite prevalent in modern cars which help in personalizing and enhancing the driving experience. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are expected to play an important role in transforming the automotive industry. A rising number of manufacturers are making use of algorithms that use data to automate the method of setting up a vehicle which includes a car’s infotainment system and its preference for applications. Today more and more vehicles are incorporating Internet of Things (IoT) technologies that can easily connect with smartphones and respond to voice commands thus improving the user interface. Predictive vehicle technology can also be very useful in the form of superior sensors installed in a car that informs the driver/owner of the car that requires the service. Depending on the car’s condition the technology will be able to notify users of any safety threats linked with a faulty part or component set up service appointments in real-time and estimate its performance.

The advent of ML in the automotive industry excessive usage of real-time data for vehicular applications and the emergence of self-driving cars are anticipated to bolster growth of the predictive vehicle technology market over the years. However the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the delay in R&D testing and other initiatives in the development of predictive vehicle technology worldwide.

10. Cars-as-a-service (CaaS): Offers flexibility to customers

The Cars-as-a-Service (CaaS) model is an enhancement over the existing car rental model. The agreements bind customers with cars for very long periods of time. In addition the lease period established at the commencement of the lease is fixed and any alterations made to the lease result in severe penalties and monetary losses from the customer’s point of view. On the other hand the CaaS model offers flexibility in the hands of customers who can modify and upgrade their cars as and when they require. Similar to lease agreements the subscription to a car does not bind the customer for a long timeframe. Customers can opt for cars on a month-to-month basis.

CaaS model will basically transform transportation for those living in cities and use public transportation and rideshare services quite often. And it has gained wide attention in the automotive sector with regards to providing luxury subscription plans.

Furthermore COVID-19 adversely impacted the CaaS market as the demand for car rental service slumped to its lowest level. However the model is robust and attractive and is anticipated to gain momentum in the coming years.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5hbHBoYXN0cmVldC5jb20vZWFybmluZ3MtY2FsZW5kYXItZm9yLXRoZS13ZWVrLW9mLWZlYnJ1YXJ5LTEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Earnings calendar for the week of February 1,"In a week that saw one of the worst stock selloffs Gamestop came under spotlight after the stock experienced unprecedented fluctuations marked by a 10-fold spike in value followed by a sharp retreat.

Zuckerberg ""reached out to talk about the code and the impact on Facebook"" and a constructive discussion followed last week between the social media billionaire Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg and communications minister Paul Fletcher.

""No Mark Zuckerberg didn't convince me to back down if that's what you're asking"" Frydenberg told the Australian Broadcasting Corp without giving further details of the meeting.

A Facebook spokeswoman in Australia said the company's executives regularly meet with government stakeholders on a range of topics.

""We're actively engaging with the Australian government with the goal of landing on a workable framework to support Australia's news ecosystem"" she said.

Australia intends to introduce a law that would force Facebook the world's largest social media platform and internet search giant Google Inc to negotiate payments to media companies whose content drives traffic to their websites. If the parties cannot agree on payments a government-appointed arbitrator will set the fees for them.

Facebook and Google oppose the ""News Media Bargaining Code"" and have mounted public campaigns against it. Google has threatened to withdraw its search engine from Australia while Facebook has warned it would stop Australians sharing news content on its site if the laws go ahead.

At a Senate inquiry into the planned law this month local heads of both companies outlined their opposition to the plans which would be among the toughest in the world in dealing with the financial impact of global internet companies on domestic media which have been hit by shrinking advertising revenue.

""We're told that if we go ahead with this we're going to break the internet"" Frydenberg said on the ABC.

""What I do know is that media businesses should be paid for content.""

“There were some gut punches” last spring said Webb Estes a vice president at Estes Express who is a great-grandson of the founder and one of about 10 members of the Estes family who work for the 90-year-old company.

“Obviously last year was a year no one could have prepared for fully” Estes said adding that shipments dropped off about 20% during the first month after the pandemic hit.

Founded in 1931 by W.W. Estes as a small trucking company with just one Chevrolet truck Estes Express is now one of the nation’s largest freight transportation providers generating more than $3.5 billion in revenue last year. It is run by the third and fourth generations of Estes family.

The company which experienced a big growth spurt with the deregulation of the trucking industry in the early 1980s has grown to employ about 19500 people across the country including about 1200 in the Richmond region and about 8500 truck drivers nationwide.

The company handles more than 50000 shipments a day from its more than 260 trucking terminals in the U.S. and Canada including eight in Virginia.

During the pandemic the company doubled down on its role as part of an essential industry shipping goods to Americans Estes said.

“We made it our focus from the get-go to take care of our customers and take care of our employees” Estes said. “We decided we were going to hang onto our people and do everything to not let people go.”

That included putting about $2 million into buying personal protective gear for employees as well as cleaning supplies at its trucking terminals to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Even the forklifts at its trucking bays get sanitized every few hours.

The privately held company which executives say is debt-free also was able to give out more than $7 million in interest-free loans to employees who were facing family financial difficulties as a result of the pandemic.

By mid-May the business was seeing a rebound in shipping volumes propelled partly by people ordering products online along with health care-related shipments such as personal protective equipment and shipments to big-box retailers especially home improvement stores.

“The last four to six months [in late 2020 and January 2021] we have been up 15% year-over-year” Estes said. That’s well ahead of the company’s targeted annual growth rate of 5% to 10%.

******

Entering 2021 Estes Express which has its headquarters on West Broad Street a couple of blocks east of Malvern Avenue is now in an expansion mode with plans to hire more drivers and other employees this year while also adding trucking hubs around the country.

“We’re looking to hire about 2500 employees across the country” Estes said of its hiring plans for 2021. “That is more than 10% of the current staffing.”

Last spring “we doubled down and bought more trucks and trailers” he said. “When no one else was buying we felt like it was good time to get some good deals.”

The company plans this year to add 725 trucks and 4100 trailers which amounts to about a 15% growth in its truck and trailer fleet.

Estes Express also has opened new trucking terminals in the last several months in Hagerstown Md. and Topeka Kan. Early in 2020 the company opened three terminals in Montana and it is building new terminals in Georgia Tennessee and California.

The company’s trucking hub on Commerce Road in South Richmond recently was buzzing with activity as forklifts loaded products onto Estes Express trucks delivering goods destined for stores or customers around Virginia.

Estes Express operates a “hub and spoke” trucking distribution system that functions in some ways like airlines do with flights between numerous “spoke” destinations that connect at an airline’s hub airport. The Richmond site which employs more than 160 people is a midsize hub with 70 loading doors.

Bryan Burmaster who manages the Richmond terminal said shipping activity picked up strongly in the second half of 2020.

“We’re hoping 2021 will be better” he said. “We hope with the vaccines coming out people will go back to normal living.”

Asked why he has stayed with the company for more than 30 years Burmaster pointed to the Estes family. “They take care of you and they invest in the company” he said.

Estes Express competes mainly in the more than $40 billion-a-year market segment of trucking known as less-than-truckload shipping.

The company mostly handles shipments that are bigger than the small parcels delivered by UPS or FedEx but not large enough to take up an entire 18-wheeler truckload.

Usually those are shipments of products that weigh around 150 pounds at the low end and up to 10000 or 12000 pounds at the high end. Estes Express has handled shipping on some of the COVID-19 vaccines.

Another company operating in the same less-than-truckload segment is Richmond-based UPS Freight which was created in 2005 when Atlanta-based United Parcel Service Inc. purchased the former Overnite Transportation.

UPS Freight which generated an estimated $3.14 billion in revenue last year announced on Jan. 25 that it is being sold to a Canadian trucking giant for $800 million.

During the pandemic Estes Express and other trucking companies have faced a situation where some customers’ business dropped to almost nothing while some customers saw business soar said David Ross a managing director at the financial services firm Stifel who follows the transportation and logistics industries.

“They have had to manage through that” Ross said of Estes Express. “The impressive thing that Estes has done — and a lot of less-than-truckload carriers have done — is they have found a way to keep goods moving.”

Ross said Estes Express is investing for the long term.

“For the short term they are trying to make sure they have enough people to move the freight they can move” he said. “Longer term they need to have the infrastructure to move more freight.”

One of the niche markets that Estes Express competes in that has seen growth recently is in final-mile deliveries of goods directly to consumers.

“If you order something like a treadmill or lawn furniture or lawn mowers or weight-lifting equipment — those types of products — more and more customers have not wanted to go to a retail location to get those because of COVID” Estes said.

Final-mile shipments were about 10% of the company’s deliveries prior to the pandemic. “We have grown over 50% in that final-mile space in this past year” Estes said. “There is definitely a pivot within our business where we have smaller shipments headed to the final-mile consumer than in the past. Our network was the right fit for a lot of companies.”

“One of the big focuses [in 2020 and 2021] is how we can move forward at a much faster clip with technology in the final-mile business” said Estes who oversees process improvement and technology in his vice president role. “We have rolled out text message updates for customers where they can get updates on shipments. We are now doing [customer] surveys after deliveries.”

The company has benefited from an increase in package shipments and has been able to compete based on reputation and service said George Hoffer a transportation economist and professor emeritus at Virginia Commonwealth University.

“The carriers compete with each other on speed and convenience of service and that is how you protect yourself from the upstarts undercutting you in terms of price” Hoffer said.

******

Robey W. “Rob” Estes Jr. the company’s chief executive officer and grandson of the founder who started working for the company in 1975 said the demand for freight movement has “changed a lot” during his career.

Most shipments are still full truckloads rather than less-than-truckload but “with changes in just-in-time inventories there has been a significant switch away from full truckload and a significant amount of business in the less-than-truckload shipments that we play in” said Rob Estes who became president in 1990 and took over as CEO from his father Robey Estes Sr. in 2001.

Estes Express has an advantage by being privately owned he said.

“As a private company we can focus on the long term where public companies are really judged by Wall Street and their investors quarter by quarter” he said. “A lot of times short-term decisions are made to show results that may not be the best for the long-term.”

During the COVID-19 pandemic Estes Express also has jumped into the market for delivering personal protective equipment such as masks mainly for health care providers.

As of mid-January the company had delivered more than 190 million pieces of PPE.

“That is part of being essential” Webb Estes said.

The family business is growing in other ways.

In September the company’s Estes Forwarding Worldwide subsidiary which specializes in logistics and warehousing announced it had acquired Lewis Logistics a warehousing distribution and logistics provider based in North Carolina.

The acquisition led to the establishment of EFW Warehousing LLC a full-service warehousing network with locations in six states.

******

Even with its growth plans though a big issue Estes Express faces is a shortage of truck drivers.

“There has been a continuing shortage of drivers more and more each year and that was exacerbated in 2020 because a lot of driving schools had to shut down or were limited because of COVID so there are not as many drivers coming into the industry” Webb Estes said.

Estes Express normally trains about 250 drivers in-house each year but in 2020 it was only able to train about 100 “just because of COVID limitations and challenges” Webb Estes said.

Rob Estes said he sees the COVID-19 crisis pushing technological change in the trucking industry at a faster rate.

“With technology improvements we know where our drivers are and customers can know where they are.” he said. “The technology is changing what we do and changing customers’ expectations. The number of goods we deliver to customers’ homes is up.”

“Even though I mention technology and the change in our business mix it is still a people business” Rob Estes said. “Our more than 19000 people get it done every day. Certainly police and firefighters and first responders are on the front lines every day but our people also are on the front lines every day.”

“With what we have done in 90 years I would say in the last 10 months I have been the most proud of our team” Rob Estes said.",,,

He's also not enamored of the trend for contests and TV shows about the chase for investments. He doubts that the founders of Minnesota's biggest companies such as Best Buy's Richard Schulze or UnitedHealth's Richard Burke would have won any of them.

""There was nothing unique about their ideas"" Rao said. ""Their genius was in their strategy and skills to execute their strategy. And they just happened to build some of Minnesota's greatest companies.""

Rao notes that the founders of Google Apple and Microsoft avoided or were refused venture capital for years. They waited until they were large and powerful enough to control their own destiny.

Minnesota has had some VC-fueled winners over the last 20 years. However most were purchased by other companies before they became the $1 billion revenue-and-market value ""unicorns"" such as United Health Medtronic and Best Buy that Rao contends is the spine of a strong economy.

Rao an engineer and Ph.D. in finance taught at Harvard the University of Minnesota and most recently at Florida International University. He worked 20-plus years in venture finance and economic development in Milwaukee.

In 2009 Rao wrote ""Bootstrap to Billions."" Last year: ""Finance Secrets of Billion-Dollar Entrepreneurs."" In it Rao interviewed and analyzed the work and skills of Burke Schulze Medtronic founder Earl Bakken Fastenal founder Bob Kierlin and others.

""These are the unicorn billion-dollar entrepreneurs … who [bootstrap-and-borrowed] from startup to more than $1 billion in sales and valuation … among the world's most successful entrepreneurs"" he said.

Rao criticizes the motivation for VCs to gain disproportionate control and wealth for themselves and their investors which leads them to drive companies to go public or sell to bigger firms.

And he explains the business-finance strategies that kept the successful founders in control; from friendly individual investors to various forms of debt finance partnerships and capital-conservation strategies.

Rao said VCs fail to make money on eight of 10 ventures. So they need big success from the other two something like 300%-plus returns to produce aggregate returns that surpass what investors can make in the stock market.

VCs generally invest after a startup company's potential is evident he said. Entrepreneurs need to stay independent longer in search of greater long-term results downstream. That can be tough to do when VCs and investment bankers are dangling millions your way.

Jeff Hinck managing director of Rally Ventures which has offices in the Twin Cities and Silicon Valley presents the counterargument. He said last year's 42% jump in VC investment in the state is great news for entrepreneurs of all stripes.

""VC-backed companies have been a driver of startup activity and job growth in Minnesota for decades"" he said. ""Current and former Rally Ventures portfolio companies such as Compellent SportsEngine Total Expert and others have created thousands of net new jobs in Minnesota. Former employees have created thousands more via new startups.

""There are also a number of current $1 billion-plus [market value] VC-backed companies headquartered here. Jamf Protolabs SPS Commerce and Sezzle to name a few. And companies that are sold generate executives and employees who know what it takes for a business to succeed. They pass on knowledge which creates a more successful startup and economic ecosystem.""

A local venture capitalist recently praised the University of Minnesota-sponsored Minnesota Cup sweepstakes that is the largest pitch competition in the country.

The U's business school since 2006 helped launch 165-plus startups which have attracted $1.15 billion in capital. Seven went public since 2017.

Rao is watching. A grateful immigrant Rao said he is an admirer of Mahatma Gandhi the nonviolent father of Indian independence 70 years ago.

""The only reason [I'm] here and doing well is because of Gandhi"" said Rao. ""Independent India focused on education and developing its youth with world-class institutions.""

Rao's book is a finalist for the Eric Hoffer Award a prestigious competition named after the American philosopher for books published by academic and independent presses. Rao has aided our economy and sparked healthy debate.

President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi has instructed completing Egypt’s Universal Health Insurance System (UHIS) nationwide in 10 years instead of the scheduled 15-years finance minister Mohamed Maait stated on Friday.

El-Sisi believes the project is one of the tools to reform the healthcare sector in Egypt pointed out Maait who is also head of the UHIS.

""The president is continuously asking about the availability and adequacy of financial allocations for the UHIS"" Maait added.

The six-phase healthcare scheme which started experimentally in Port Said governorate in early 2018 was scheduled to cover Egypt by 2032 but based on Maait's announcement the project will be now completed nationwide by 2027.

The first phase which includes Port Said Ismailia Suez South Sinai Luxor and Aswan was due to take four years to complete with an estimated cost of $510 million.

Governorates with the lowest-income citizens have been given priority in the programme’s schedule with the capital Cairo relegated to the final phase.

Maait said the programme is expected to be rolled out in the rest of the governorates in the first phase this year.

The project will be supported by state-of-art automation technologies as part of the Digital Egypt strategy a broader national plan targeting the digitisation of all government services countrywide.

The second phase of the scheme will include Luxor Matrouh the Red Sea and Qena governorates.

The third phase will cover Alexandria Beheira Damietta Sohag and Kafr El-Sheikh.

The fourth will cover Beni Sf Assiut Minya the New Valley and Fayoum.

The fifth phase covers Daqahliya Sharqiya Gharbiya and Menoufiya.

The last phase will cover Cairo Giza and Qalioubiya.

Over three million Egyptians have registered in the country's new healthcare insurance system in six governorates as of October 2020 the UHIS.

Egypt has been scaling up efforts to develop the healthcare infrastructure including upgrading clinics and hospitals as well as constructing new health units nationwide.

The total cost of the new scheme is expected to hit EGP 210 billion ($13.38 billion) annually once the entire population estimated in excess of 100 million citizens registers in the new system.

The BLOX team is doing amazing things. Photo via BLOX

BLOX is a team of architects engineers manufacturers builders logisticians computer programmers and more who work together to bring new ideas to the construction industry. With over 400 people BLOX manufactures complete modules that can then be inserted as one whole piece in the construction of a building. This company is truly proof that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.

Their dedicated team has sacrificed time with their families holidays weekends and health to change a legacy industry. With their efforts they’ve made BLOX look like an overnight success. In reality it’s taken passion and hard work from hundreds of people to get there.

“That team… have made this thing look like it’s successful quickly but it’s a lot of people and a lot of time and a lot of hard work to get there.” Chris Giattina CEO BLOX

Along with their growth they’re innovating solutions in the fight against COVID-19. As we reported in March the designers and builders at BLOX didn’t hesitate to create a prototype for Mobile Isolation Care Units (MICU).

BLOX is based in the old Pullman Standard train car factory in Bessemer so they can bring every aspect of the process of building under one roof. Their Design Manufacture Construct (DMC) method combines manufacturing and technology to make construction simple.

The $40M Investment Will Accelerate BLOX’s Mission

COVID-19 has highlighted the need of improving mental healthcare: Expert Experts expect massive allocation towards improving access to healthcare

New Delhi: In a statement last month Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitaraman said that ‘Health’ would take top priority and investment in health is going to be absolutely critical in the upcoming Budget 2021-22. She said that the government would be looking to not just provide buildings for hospitals but also the technology and infrastructure apart from improving the availability of doctors and nurses to service the sector and reduce out-of-pocket expenditure for the people. According to experts after a year dominated by COVID-19 pandemic that has till date caused over 1.5 lakh fatalities in the country and over 21.7 lakh deaths worldwide it is indeed expected that health expenditure will be a focus of the Union Budget that will be presented on Monday (February 1).

Here are some of the major expectations of doctors and medical experts from the budget:

Increase In Public Healthcare Expenditure

The High Level Group On Health Sector constituted by Fifteenth Finance Commission which includes eminent experts such as Dr Randeep Guleria Director AIIMS New Delhi Dr Devi Shetty Chairman Narayana Health Sciences Pune and Dr Naresh Trehan Chairman Medanta City Gurgaon has proposed a plan for a phased increase in health expenditure to achieve the target of 2.5 per cent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 2025. GDP is the value of goods and services produced within the geographic boundaries of a country during a year. According to the group’s estimates allocation towards health should be increased to 1.92 per cent of GDP in the budget for FY 2021-22.

Professor Dileep Mavalankar Director Indian Institute of Public Health Gandhinagar said that the budget for health and family welfare must increase by at least 50 per cent at the state and central level. He said

Our aim should be to reach 3 per cent of GDP for health from the current 1.2 per cent in the next 5 years.

Professor Mavalankar said that an increased health budget is required so that the healthcare system can be strengthened in the villages and in urban areas. He also added that the increased expenditure is required for improving medical colleges and institutions dedicated to public health like National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) All India Institute of Hygiene and Public Health (AIIHPH)  Indian Institutes of Public Health and other schools of public health as well as public health divisions in the Ministry of Health.

According to Dr Aviral Roy Consultant Critical Care Medica Superspecialty Hospital in Kolkata while the rapid actions of the government and tireless efforts of healthcare workers have helped in the fight against COVID-19 the pandemic has however highlighted the gap in the healthcare system and has underscored the need to invest in infrastructure. He said

Our hospital infrastructure is very poor. COVID-19 has shown how we lacked on the required beds for patients almost everywhere in the country. All the government and private hospitals ran out of bed. Make-shift arrangements had to be done to keep the patients.

The lack of adequate public health infrastructure along with high out-of-pocket expenditure imposes a high financial burden on household and there increasing the healthcare budget allocation is of utmost importance added Dr Roy.

Upsurge In Investment In Medical Research And Development

Experts said that massive investment is required for research and development in the healthcare sector. According to Dr Roy currently there is one government body – Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) and the institutions under it where all the research happen. He said

Apart from ICMR medical research is largely done by private pharmaceutical companies and all pharma companies are profit-oriented entities looking to sell their drugs. Therefore we urgently need more government support towards research and build public research institute armed with capable minds.

Dr. K K Aggarwal President of the Confederation of Medical Association of Asia and Oceania (CMAAO) and Former President Indian Medical Association (IMA) said that instead of relying only on private players the government must set-up its own lab for researching and developing its own vaccine against diseases. He said this will not only reduce government spending on buying vaccines from entities but will also ensure equitable access of vaccines for all.

Improvement In Healthcare Facilities At Primary Level

Dr Roy highlighted that in order to aim for improvement in health status of the people increased investments are needed in the primary healthcare. He said

Unfortunately the programmes that we have right now like Ayushman Bharat Swasth Sathi are not able to make much of a difference at the grassroots level. This is because reimbursing government hospitals with public funds under the name of Ayushman Bharat for surgeries will not be helpful to a patient because they will be getting it for free anyway. That was always the point of government hospitals- to provide subsidised healthcare to the needy. But what we really need is more budget allocation on health at the primary level. We need to upscale the services being provided currently and increase the type of health services at the primary level so that people do not have to risk their lives in order to access better care at hospitals that are far.

Archana Sharma Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) working at L.D. Bhatt Government Hospital at Kashipur district of Uttarakhand said that in the upcoming budget she expects to see an increased allocation towards the remuneration for frontline workers such as her. She said

ASHAs have been on the frontline in the fight against COVID-19 at the community level risking our lives. Our role should be recognised and we should get better regular remuneration instead of current incentive-based system. We get Rs. 400 per delivery for taking pregnant women to hospital for institutional delivery Rs. 100 per card for Measles immunization Rs. 100 per day for polio camps Rs. 150 for conducting monthly meetings for reporting on the work we did in the month and only Rs. 2000 per month as honorarium.

Meena Ganesh Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Portea Medical a consumer healthcare brand said that Budget 2021 will most likely dedicate some amount to building telemedicine infrastructure in the country especially in the rural areas. She said

Despite about 75 per cent of the Indian population residing in rural areas the healthcare system is extremely inadequate in rural areas. This is where the delivery of health services in the rural areas through e-health/e-medicine and other such technology-driven means is going to play a transformational role. To make this happen the government must ramp up the medical as well as training infrastructure in a big way. Funds must be allocated towards skill development of teachers nurses paramedical staff and caregivers. Further by making budget allocations for the development of telemedicine and home-based healthcare ecosystem in the country it is possible to best harness the available resources to cover the whole country.

According to Shumita Kakkar Founder United We Care a digital platform for providing mental healthcare to people mental health needs to become a part of primary healthcare. She said that the pandemic has changed the way people live and interact with each other in the society and has highlighted the dire need of improving mental healthcare services in the country.

Promoting Affordable Healthcare For Women In India

Dr. Surbhi Singh Gynaecologist and Founder of ‘Sachhi Saheli’ a Delhi-based NGO that works towards raising awareness about menstruation said that the upcoming health budget must have a provision for affordable healthcare for women. She said

Affordable Healthcare for women in India is absolutely indispensable as not only will their health help them live better well-adjusted lives but will also enable them to contribute towards society.

She said that while planning for healthcare for women the government must focus on providing the following:

– free health checkup at least once in a year

– insurance to all women to cover pregnancy and delivery costs

– free of cost cancer screening after the age of 40 years

– free cervical cancer vaccine for women and girls

– subsidised sanitary pads/menstrual cups to all women and girls

Better Allocation Towards Preventive Care

According to Dr Roy the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has underlined the need to invest in and ensure proper implementation of programmes that help in strengthening preventive care. He said

The government must focus on increasing people’s access to clean drinking water sanitation nutrition immunisation treatment of diseases like Tuberculosis measures to prevent malaria dengue and other such diseases.

Vikas Bagaria Founder Pee Safe sanitation and personal care brand said that the government must continue promoting preventive care by promoting hand-hygiene thorough and regular sanitization of the public as well as private spaces and ensure ample availability of the hygiene products for the public.

It aims to spread awareness about critical health issues facing the country. In wake of the current COVID-19 pandemic the need for WASH (Water Sanitation and Hygiene) is reaffirmed as handwashing is one of the ways to prevent Coronavirus infection and other diseases. The campaign highlights the importance of nutrition and healthcare for women and children to prevent maternal and child mortality fight malnutrition stunting wasting anaemia and disease prevention through vaccines. Importance of programmes like Public Distribution System (PDS) Mid-day Meal Scheme POSHAN Abhiyan and the role of Aganwadis and ASHA workers are also covered. Only a Swachh or clean India where toilets are used and open defecation free (ODF) status achieved as part of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2014 can eradicate diseases like diahorrea and become a Swasth or healthy India. The campaign will continue to cover issues like air pollution waste management plastic ban manual scavenging and sanitation workers and menstrual hygiene.

According to statistics from the World Health Organisation (WHO) one-third of the world’s population is infected by TB and is currently an epidemic in much of the world causing mortality of about 1.5 – 1.8 million people per annum especially in less developed countries like Uganda. Indeed TB threat is endemic in lower and middle income countries to the extent that an overwhelming majority of TB deaths (over 95 per cent) occur in these countries.

The day is partly a commemoration of the discovery of TB bacillus (a bacteria that is a major cause of tuberculosis) by Dr Robert Koch in 1882 a milestone which remarkably advanced TB control efforts and empowered the scientific community with regard to diagnosing and curing TB.

TB control is high in the contemporary global public health agenda and today the world commits itself to end this deadly epidemic (among others like AIDS and malaria) by 2030 a health goal enshrined in the third global Sustainable Development Goal (SDG # 3.3).

This is a seemingly ambitious goal for a developing country like Uganda given that we operate in a highly resource-constrained setting and our health (TB related) performance indicators are still very poor and far from the “World End TB Strategy” ambition. The poor performance is reflected for instance in Uganda having one of the highest prevalence mortality and low success cases of TB making it to be rated among the 22 TB high burden countries in the world. TB is the number one killer of HIV/Aids patients in Uganda due to TB-HIV/Aids co-infection. Uganda’s TB service delivery system is plagued with numerous gaps such as among others; poor access to diagnostic and treatment services and/or skewed diagnostic and treatment units in favour of urban areas. Rural health facilities suffer from poor state or lack of infrastructure to diagnose and treat TB and yet they are located in areas where TB is most prevalent. A small fraction of health facilities provide TB services and there is dysfunctional TB referral system at district level.

Accordingly it is indispensable to reverse these predicaments if the country is to move towards the 2030 target of ending the TB epidemic. According to the “End TB Strategy” by WHO the goal of ending TB appears ambitious but it is feasible with employment of existing tools complemented by increased investments in universal health coverage and social protection. There are already some breakthroughs around the world to end TB for instance empirical evidence based on recent trials in Africa spearheaded by the TB Alliance reveal two new therapies that can potentially turn TB around. These therapies which are products of research and innovation are able to cure all forms of TB in shorter time spans including those that are the most difficult to treat. This is a great stride and Uganda can subscribe to this agenda through investments in research and development (TB research agenda) in order to contribute to the “Unite to end TB” effort using innovative evidence-based approaches.

To reverse the TB predicaments that Uganda faces and make meaningful progress towards the global sustainable development aspiration of stamping out TB public investments need to address existing gross TB service delivery gaps that are critical for TB prevention and treatment. This can be done by streamlining the following key intervention areas among others. First is prioritising TB research and innovation as well as instituting an effective routine TB surveillance system in the monitoring and evaluation framework of TB control programme. Second is raising public commitment in terms of funding TB control given that almost 20 per cent of national TB budget is unfunded. Third is improving access to TB diagnostic and care services given that TB is a poverty related disease which disproportionality affects the poorest vulnerable and marginalised (especially urban slums and rural-based) segments of the population. This involves equipping lower level and rural health facilities to enhance their capacity to diagnose and fully treat TB as well as building health worker’s capacity through periodic training on Directly Observed Therapy (DOTS) strengthening community-based DOTS implementation to address TB service delivery needs of the disadvantaged or vulnerable sections of the population full operationalisation of Diagnostic and Treatment Units in non-DOTS implementing health facilities and operationalising district level TB referral system."

SAN ANTONIO — A new documentary is focusing on what it's like to live in San Antonio as a Black man or boy. It's called ""Living in My Skin"" and shares the stories of 33 people who range in age from 10 to 90 years old.

The two-part documentary which made its debut on February 2 at 8 p.m. has one simple goal: to get people to have a better understanding of each other. The film is free and able to be streamed on KLRN's website. All of the episodes will also be available along with a virtual online art exhibit that is already live on the film's website.

An important question is raised on the documentary's website using a fact about the city's demographics: ""The Black population of San Antonio is only 7% yet it hosts the largest MLK march in the nation. Additionally 63% of our citizens are Hispanic making us a majority-minority city. Many perceive San Antonio to be culturally enlightened and highly evolved. Is it?""

Brandon Logan and Seymour Battle are the film's co-executive producers. The project's main sponsors are Bank of America and Valero Energy Foundation and is directed by Lionel Sosa who painted the portraits of those highlighted.

Logan recalls a memory from his childhood when he was called the n-word by a police officer as a pivotal moment in his own story.

""That was the moment that I realized there was much more to my story that I didn’t know about. So it’s important considering the times we’re living in now to be intentional with raising the conversation around the Black male experience"" he said. ""The ugliest underbelly of America is rearing itself. And there is a real fight for the soul of this country. And that is why I thought it was important for us in San Antonio to identify men from varied backgrounds to share their story.”

Battle points to history sharing about the tragic deaths of many Black leaders as reasons the project is so important.

“You grow up learning about so many great Black men who did so many great things spoke out against wrong things and did all the right things in the right way"" Battle said. ""And almost every one of those stories ends up the same way: Dead.""

Both Battle and Logan are hoping their efforts with the documentary and art exhibit will bring about change.",,,,,,,,,,,,

(CNN) -- Tesla registró su primer año completo de ingresos netos en 2020 pero no debido a las ventas a sus clientes.

Once estados requieren que los fabricantes de automóviles vendan un cierto porcentaje de vehículos de cero emisiones para 2025. Si no pueden los fabricantes de automóviles tienen que comprar créditos regulatorios de otro fabricante de automóviles que cumpla con esos requisitos como Tesla que vende exclusivamente automóviles eléctricos.

Es un negocio lucrativo para Tesla que generó US$ 3.300 millones en el transcurso de los últimos cinco años casi la mitad de eso solo en 2020. Los US$ 1.600 millones en créditos regulatorios que recibió el año pasado superaron con creces los ingresos netos de Tesla de US$ 721 millones lo que significa que Tesla habría registrado una pérdida neta en 2020.

""Estos tipos están perdiendo dinero vendiendo autos. Están ganando dinero vendiendo créditos. Y los créditos están desapareciendo"" dijo Gordon Johnson de GLJ Research y uno de los mayores bajistas de las acciones de Tesla.

Los altos ejecutivos de Tesla admiten que la compañía no puede contar con que esa fuente de efectivo continúe.

publicidad

""Esta es siempre un área que nos resulta extremadamente difícil de pronosticar"" afirmó el director financiero de Tesla Zachary Kirkhorn. ""A largo plazo las ventas a crédito regulatorio no serán una parte material del negocio y no planificamos el negocio en torno a eso. Es posible que durante un puñado de trimestres adicionales siga siendo fuerte. También es posible que no los sea"".

Los 11 estados que requerirán que un cierto porcentaje de automóviles sean vehículos de emisión cero o que los fabricantes de automóviles compren créditos de una empresa como Tesla que haya superado el objetivo son California Colorado Connecticut Maine Maryland Massachusetts Nueva York Nueva Jersey Oregon Rhode Island y Vermont.

Tesla también informa otras medidas de rentabilidad al igual que muchas otras empresas. Y con esas medidas las ganancias son lo suficientemente grandes como para que no dependan de las ventas de créditos para estar en números negros.

La compañía informó ingresos netos ajustados en 2020 excluyendo elementos como la compensación basada en acciones de US$ 1.700 millones de US$ 2.500 millones. Su ganancia bruta automotriz que compara los ingresos totales de su negocio de automóviles con los gastos directamente asociados con la construcción de los automóviles fue de US$ 5.400 millones incluso excluyendo los ingresos por ventas de créditos regulatorios. Y su flujo de caja libre de US$2.800 millones de dólares aumentó un 158% con respecto al año anterior un cambio radical con respecto a 2018 cuando Tesla consumía efectivo y en peligro de quedarse sin dinero.

Sus partidarios dicen que esas medidas muestran que Tesla está ganando dinero por fin después de años de pérdidas en la mayoría de esas medidas. Esa rentabilidad es una de las razones por las que las acciones se desempeñaron tan bien durante más de un año.

Pero el debate entre escépticos y devotos de la empresa sobre si Tesla es realmente rentable se ha convertido en una ""Guerra Santa"" según Gene Munster socio gerente de Loup Ventures y un analista tecnológico líder.

""Debaten dos cosas diferentes. Nunca llegarán a una resolución"" comentó. Munster cree que los críticos se centran demasiado en cómo los créditos aún superan los ingresos netos. Sostiene que el margen de utilidad bruta automotriz excluyendo las ventas de créditos regulatorios es el mejor barómetro para el éxito financiero de la empresa.

""Es un indicador adelantado"" de esa medida de las ganancias de Tesla dijo. ""No hay posibilidad de que GM y VW estén ganando dinero sobre esa base con sus vehículos eléctricos"".

El futuro de Tesla

El elevado rendimiento de las acciones de Tesla un aumento del 743% en 2020 la convierte en una de las empresas estadounidenses más valiosas del mundo. Sin embargo los 500.000 autos que vendió en 2020 fueron una pequeña parte de más de 70 millones de vehículos que se estima que se vendieron en todo el mundo.

Las acciones de Tesla ahora valen aproximadamente tanto como las de los 12 fabricantes de automóviles más grandes combinados que venden más del 90% de los automóviles a nivel mundial.

Lo que Tesla tiene que otros fabricantes de automóviles no tienen es un rápido crecimiento: la semana pasada pronosticó un crecimiento anual de las ventas del 50% en los próximos años y espera hacerlo incluso mejor que eso en 2021 ya que otros fabricantes de automóviles luchan por volver a los niveles de ventas pre-pandemia.

Toda la industria se está moviendo hacia un futuro totalmente eléctrico tanto para cumplir con las regulaciones ambientales más estrictas a nivel mundial como para satisfacer el creciente apetito por los vehículos eléctricos en parte porque requieren menos mano de obra menos piezas y cuestan menos para construir que los automóviles tradicionales de gasolina.

""Algo en lo que la mayoría de la gente puede estar de acuerdo es que los vehículos eléctricos son el futuro"" afirmó Munster. ""Creo que es una suposición segura"".

Si bien Tesla es el fabricante líder de automóviles eléctricos se enfrenta a una mayor competencia a medida que prácticamente todos los fabricantes de automóviles lanzan sus propios vehículos eléctricos o planean hacerlo. Volkswagen ha superado a Tesla en términos de ventas de vehículos eléctricos en la mayor parte de Europa. GM dijo la semana pasada que espera cambiar por completo a automóviles libres de emisiones para 2035.

""La competencia está haciendo que los autos de Tesla sean irrelevantes"" aseguró Johnson de GLJ Resarch. ""No vemos esto como un modelo de negocio sostenible"".

Otros analistas sostienen que el precio de las acciones de Tesla está justificado dado que puede beneficiarse del cambio a los vehículos eléctricos.

""No se mantendrán en una participación del 80-90% del mercado de vehículos eléctricos pero pueden seguir creciendo incluso con una participación de mercado mucho menor"" dijo Daniel Ives analista de tecnología de Wedbush Securities. ""Estamos mirando al norte de 3 millones a 4 millones de vehículos anualmente a medida que avanzamos en 2025-26 con el 40% de ese crecimiento proveniente de China. Creemos que ahora están en la trayectoria que incluso sin los créditos seguirá siendo rentable"".",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVsZWNvbm9taXN0YS5jb20ubXgvZW1wcmVzYXMvVmVudGFzLWRlLWF1dG9zLTIwMjAtZWwtYW5vLXF1ZS1zZS1xdWVkby1lbi1wdW50by1tdWVydG8tMjAyMTAxMzAtMDAwNC5odG1s0gF4aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZWxlY29ub21pc3RhLmNvbS5teC9hbXAvZW1wcmVzYXMvVmVudGFzLWRlLWF1dG9zLTIwMjAtZWwtYW5vLXF1ZS1zZS1xdWVkby1lbi1wdW50by1tdWVydG8tMjAyMTAxMzAtMDAwNC5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ventas de autos: 2020 el año que se quedó en punto muerto,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.eleconomista.com.mx/empresas/Ventas-de-autos-2020-el-ano-que-se-quedo-en-punto-muerto-20210130-0004.html on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVsZWNvbm9taXN0YS5jb20ubXgvZW1wcmVzYXMvVmVudGFzLWRlLWF1dG9zLTIwMjAtZWwtYW5vLXF1ZS1zZS1xdWVkby1lbi1wdW50by1tdWVydG8tMjAyMTAxMzAtMDAwNC5odG1s0gF4aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZWxlY29ub21pc3RhLmNvbS5teC9hbXAvZW1wcmVzYXMvVmVudGFzLWRlLWF1dG9zLTIwMjAtZWwtYW5vLXF1ZS1zZS1xdWVkby1lbi1wdW50by1tdWVydG8tMjAyMTAxMzAtMDAwNC5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy50cmlidW5hLmNvbS5teC90ZW5kZW5jaWFzLzIwMjEvMS8zMC9zb24tZWwtY2FsemFkby1kZS1sYS1wYW5kZW1pYS1sb3MtY3JvY3MtYXVtZW50YW4tc3VzLXZlbnRhcy1oYXN0YS1lbi11bi01My0yMjU5MTMuaHRtbNIBhgFodHRwczovL3d3dy50cmlidW5hLmNvbS5teC90ZW5kZW5jaWFzLzIwMjEvMS8zMC9zb24tZWwtY2FsemFkby1kZS1sYS1wYW5kZW1pYS1sb3MtY3JvY3MtYXVtZW50YW4tc3VzLXZlbnRhcy1oYXN0YS1lbi11bi01My0yMjU5MTMuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,¡Son el calzado de la pandemia!

Ciudad de México.- El 2020 se convirtió en un año caótico gracias a la llegada del Covid-19 y con ello el confinamiento por lo que muchas cosas cambiaron entre ellas la forma de vestir de pies a cabeza ya que al estar en casa muchas personas dejaron de utilizar ropa y calzado ajustado para pasar a lo que en el mundo de la moda se llama comfy style.

Fue gracias a esta transformación que los crocs han tenido un gran auge este famoso zapato fabricado básicamente de plástico se convirtieron en los más usados durante todo el 2020 y pareciera ser que también lo serán para el 2021.

Puede que el reciente éxito de estos famosos zapatos se deba a su gran comodidad o a las grandes colaboraciones que ha hecho con artistas de gran renombre como Justin Bieber Bad Bunny y Post Malone o con marcas muy famosas y queridas por el público como como KFC la cual fue una edición limitada que hemos visto en los pies de celebridades como Kim Kardashian.

Antes de la pandemia Alex Patton nunca había pensado en convertirse en un inversor aficionado.

Pero ahora tras el alza frenética de las acciones de GameStop una cadena de tiendas de videojuegos es un veterano de los mercados financieros.

""Antes de la covid no sabía nada sobre inversiones"" señaló el ingeniero de ciberseguridad de 28 años que vive en Kingston upon Thames al suroeste de Londres.

Pero después de que el mercado de valores sufriera una fuerte caída en marzo del año pasado y asestara un golpe a sus ahorros para una pensión Patton decidió que debería como él mismo dice ""asumir un papel más activo en la gestión de mi dinero"".

Al tener doble nacionalidad británica y estadounidense el ingeniero no tuvo problemas para abrir una cuenta con la plataforma estadounidense Robinhood la corredora de inversiones minoristas en el centro del escándalo de GameStop.

Animado por sus amigos Patten comenzó a revisar el foro ""WallStreetBets"" en la red social Reddit.

""Un amigo me dijo: 'Deberías echarle un vistazo a GameStop'. Y me di cuenta de que algunas personas en Reddit hacen un trabajo realmente impresionante investigando acciones"".

Posición arriesgada

Los principales hedge funds (fondos de cobertura o fondos de inversiones de alto riesgo) habían apostado miles de millones de dólares a que las acciones de GameStop caerían debido a que su modelo de negocios está basado en ventas físicas que han sido superadas por ventas en línea.

La investigación en Reddit indicó que las posiciones tomadas por los vendedores en corto representaban más del 100% de las acciones existentes de GameStop señaló Alex.

(En una ""venta en corto"" se toman prestadas acciones de un corredor por un interés relativamente bajo para venderlas con la intención de volver a comprarlas una vez que su precio haya caído aún más. La diferencia entre el precio más bajo y el más alto es la ganancia que obtiene el fondo de inversión).

""La gente había realizado investigaciones que mostraban la posición de riesgo en la que se encontraban esos hedge funds o fondos de cobertura. Y pensamos: 'Podemos aprovechar eso. Esta es una oportunidad'"".

Los inversores aficionados comenzaron a comprar frenéticamente acciones de GameStop e hicieron subir el precio de las acciones en más de un 700% en una semana.

Patton invirtió US$1.000 en acciones de GameStop y obtuvo una ganancia de US$2.000. Pero fue uno de los afortunados que se salió a tiempo.

""La teoría era que a medida que el precio continuaba subiendo los fondos de inversión que habían vendido en corto se verían obligados a comprar esas acciones a cualquier precio para evitar mayores pérdidas y cerrar sus posiciones en corto"" afirmó.

Pero la actividad atrajo la atención de los reguladores de la bolsa esta semana y los inversores minoristas se vieron repentinamente excluidos por sus plataformas de negociación incapaces de seguir comprando acciones de GameStop y de otras empresas.

Los precios cayeron bruscamente lo que permitió que los fondos se salieran de su apuro.

""Los reguladores asumen que los inversores minoristas no podemos gestionar nuestro riesgo mientras que los grandes fondos han asumido un riesgo enorme un riesgo increíble y simplemente se les permite continuar con sus actividades como de costumbre"" señaló el ingeniero.

Aunque Patton salió económicamente ileso considera que la intervención de los reguladores fue una injusticia.

""Existe una enorme brecha entre la clase media ordinaria la gente de clase trabajadora y estos fondosque tienen miles de millones"" señaló. ""Otros inversores aficionados están sufriendo mucho más por esto que yo"".

""No es un libre mercado""

Fuente de la imagen MYRON SAKKAS Pie de foto Myron Sakkas: ""Los grandes inversores apoyan un mercado libre capitalista solo cuando les conviene a ellos"".

Myron Sakkas de 18 años es oriundo de la ciudad de Coventry en Inglaterra y estudia en la Universidad de Warwick.

Myron perdió 30 libras esterlinas (cerca de US$40) en acciones de GameStop que tuvo durante ""un par de horas"" y vendió cuando vio lo que estaba sucediendo.

El estudiante tiene una cuenta en la plataforma Trading 212 desde agosto del año pasado y espera ingresar a la banca de inversión después de graduarse.

Sakkas aseguró estar desilusionado por lo que ve como una ""manipulación del mercado"" dirigida contra personas como él.

Para el estudiante había un objetivo claro en las ""guerras de acciones"" de GameStop como él las llama: ""los responsables de la crisis financiera de 2008 que nunca debieron rendir cuentas"".

""Entendemos que existen peligros pero aquí no había un riesgo real de un colapso en la bolsa. La intervención fue generada por personas que protegen los intereses corporativos y las personas comunes fueron otras vez los grandes perjudicados"".

""Cuando la gente común intenta ganar dinero en un sistema en el que sólo los inversores ricos pueden hacerlo eso es lo que sucede"" señaló Sakkas a la BBC.

""Esos grandes inversores apoyan un mercado libre capitalista solo cuando les conviene a ellos. Lo que vimos ahora no fue un mercado libre y llevó a que mucha gente común perdiera mucho dinero"".

Sakkas señala que su cuenta sigue bloqueada y no puede usarla mientras se verifica su identidad.

Pero afirma que cuando vuelva a tener acceso retirará los US$1.000 que tiene en su cuenta.

""Tal vez deje de invertir por un tiempo"" señaló. ""Tengo otras cosas que hacer"".

""No parece correcto""

En las redes sociales los inversores aficionados instaron a sus compañeros a retener sus acciones para evitar pérdidas adicionales mientras cuestionaban al mismo tiempo a las plataformas que restringieron sus cuentas.

Melissa Holdren una enfermera de 43 años que vive en Massachusetts Estados Unidos estaba tan indignada con la acción de las plataformas de inversión que compró acciones de una de las empresas afectadas.

Holdren usó su cuenta en Fidelity una importante corredora conocida por sus fondos mutuos para comprar acciones por un valor de US$500 en la cadena de cines AMC Entertainment.

Fue algo nuevo para la enfermera que siempre ha confiado en las grandes empresas para administrar las inversiones de su jubilación.

""Me parece muy cuestionable que una corporación privada pueda bloquear en forma unilateral la compra de acciones"" afirmó.

""No parece correcto. Si les preocupa la volatilidad del mercado ¿por qué están bloqueando sólo un lado de las transacciones?""

Holdren cuyo abuelo se ganaba la vida como corredor de bolsa independiente sabe que puede perder dinero si caen las acciones de AMC. Pero espera que su pequeña inversión ayude a sobrevivir a la cadena de cines.

La enfermera es muy crítica de las acciones de Wall Street.

""En general necesitamos repensar muchas de nuestras estructuras financieras"" aseguró.

""Después de la crisis de 2008 quedó claro que gran parte del mercado financiero estaba divorciado de la realidad de una manera que no era saludable"".

""Que se preocupen tanto de lo que está pasando en Reddit en este momento en lugar de preocuparse del panorama más amplio es engañoso"".

Desde que llegase a España en 2018 de la mano de L’Oréal la firma CeraVe –creada en 2005 en Estados Unidos– no ha hecho más crecer en ventas. Sus productos que pueden encontrarse en farmacias destacan por sus propiedades hidratantes y por una formulación que según indican sus creadores ha sido desarrollada teniendo en cuenta el criterio de profesionales dermatólogos.

Ahora que la piel sufre especialmente los cambios de temperatura o la continua exposición a los geles hidroalcohólicos no está de más hacerse con una crema multiusos que pueda hacer frente a distintos problemas de hidratación. Y precisamente buceando en el catálogo de CeraVe hemos dado con esta crema hidratante apta para el cuerpo y la cara. Una propuesta que se comercializa en un bote familiar y que está siendo un éxito de ventas en plataformas como Amazon donde los usuarios se muestran muy satisfechos con los resultados obtenidos: “La relación calidad-precio está más que justificada. La recomiendo al 100%” indica este cliente que la utilizó para calmar una piel enrojecida.

Ahora es una buena oportunidad para hacerse con ella en la tienda online Mifarma donde presenta un descuento del 20% y se puede adquirir a un precio más bajo del habitual.

¿Qué beneficios tiene la crema de CeraVe?

Si hay algo que caracteriza a los productos de esta firma es la inclusión de ceramidas colesterol o ácidos grasos en su formulación. Con estos ingredientes tal y como explica la Academia Española de Dermatología y Venereología (AEDV) en este post de lo que se trata es de mantener la barrera protectora natural de la piel. Al aplicarlos sobre las distintas partes del cuerpo actúan en la capa superior de la epidermis para frenar la entrada de posibles sustancias nocivas y prevenir la deshidratación de la piel.

En el caso de esta crema según puede leerse en su etiqueta se añaden otros ingredientes para combatir la sequedad como el ácido hialurónico. CeraVe además ha desarrollado una tecnología propia la MVE® para que los activos se liberen de forma continua y que la eficacia de la crema se prolongue tras su aplicación el mayor tiempo posible.

Ideal para cualquier parte del cuerpo

Otro aspecto a tener en cuenta es que es una crema sin olor de fácil aplicación que se absorbe rápido y no deja una sensación grasa. Está indicada también para personas con pieles sensibles o de tendencia atópica y bastaría con aplicarla una vez al día. Se puede utilizar en todo el cuerpo y por ese aporte extra de hidratación va muy bien para restaurar zonas como los pies o los codos que tienden a resecarse más o sufrir la aparición de grietas.

En Amazon donde suma más de 5.300 valoraciones esta propuesta ha alcanzado una nota media de 47 estrellas sobre 5. Entre las reseñas dejadas por los usuarios de la plataforma pueden encontrarse experiencias de uso muy positivas. “Muy hidratante va muy bien para pieles atópicas” indica por ejemplo este usuario. “Una crema superior para piel seca o muy seca. Sin olor y absorbe muy rápido” añade este otro.

Además de en Amazon se puede conseguir por tan solo 1060 euros en la tienda online de Mifarma donde presenta un descuento del 20%.

From State v. McGagh decided unanimously Friday by the Maryland high court (always a good excuse for showing The Court Of The Red Robe see above):

… Karen McGagh was tried … for falsely accusing Glenn Trebay [a Verizon store employee] of sexually assaulting her while patronizing a Verizon store. McGagh stated to a police officer and in a sworn criminal complaint that Trebay cupped her breast and touched her inner thigh. During a bench trial the State admitted a surveillance video from the Verizon store that did not show Trebay touching McGagh as she claimed {though it showed Trebay briefly touching McGagh at various points throughout the encounter}. The trial court convicted McGagh of perjury and making a false statement to police officer. McGagh received a sentence of ten years' incarceration for the perjury conviction all but eight years suspended with five years' supervised probation. McGagh also received a consecutive sentence of six months for the false report conviction…. The trial court found no evidence to support McGagh's accusations. The trial court convicted McGagh of perjury and giving a false statement to police: ""I find beyond a reasonable doubt that Ms. McGagh perjured herself and that she gave a false statement to Officer Heims. I find that she intentionally lied. And not about everything that is a many page statement of charges. Many of the things in the statement are true but the essential critical facts are untrue. It is completely and totally untrue that Mr. Trebay cupped Ms. McGagh's breast. It it's not even a close call. He didn't cup her breast he didn't brush her breast he did not touch her breast or her chest in any way. He never got close to her upper inner thigh. I can't say having looked at two plus hours of video that I know where his hands were all the time but my I feel like they were he's a as he said a garrulous guy he talks with his hands and I saw his hands in the air a lot but ""I'll tell you this he wasn't in a position to reach across from where he was and rub her or touch her upper inner thigh on the left hand side which is what Ms. McGagh told Officer Heims happened. I saw it as she showed him on the video the body camera I guess is what I mean to say. And I don't believe that she was confused about what happened. It's far more likely that she wanted Mr. Trebay fired and the story started and was sort of like that proverbial snowball going down the hill it just got more ingrained and more elaborate but it was false. And so that's my decision."" … The trial court based the sentence on an examination of the evidence McGagh's behavior before and during proceedings and a pattern of disregarding the law: ""I don't think any one of us has ever seen a case like this before and I'm sure [defense counsel] will agree we've never as [the prosecutor] mentioned never seen a pre-sentence investigation like this or a psyche evaluation like this. I obviously need to consider in my decision making rehabilitation punishment and public safety…. ""[T]his would include her history of deceitfulness consistent irresponsibility to honor financial obligations and lack of remorse. … During this investigation she continued to make statements minimizing her own actions and instead blaming the victim the Judge and her own attorney. … [T]he pre-sentence investigation again … indicates that it's been suspected that Ms. McGagh continues to drive on a suspended license. I was shocked by the number of just traffic violations just a just a consistent unrelenting inability or disregard [ ] for the law. As though it just does not apply to her … Ms. McGagh has been involved in criminal and traffic proceedings in which she has benefited from lenient dispositions.8 Regardless of these privileges she has continued to avoid hearings by numerous failing to appears and not fulfilling her financial obligations in paying fines and costs as well as financial liens against her. {In October 2015 McGagh was convicted for theft after the court found her ""to be not telling the truth."" Before this proceeding McGagh was on probation and had an outstanding restitution balance of $13000.} The trial court found that falsehoods reflected in McGagh's background followed ""a lifelong pattern of deceitfulness manipulative behavior and a narration of depicting herself as the victim."" The trial court highlighted a revealing moment of intentional deceit when McGagh told Dr. Kohn the doctor assigned to her pre-sentence psychiatric evaluation that ""she knows how to play the game and what to say."" The court explained that Mr. Trebay was not the only victim in this case:

""I believe that the police officer who was pulled away from his work and summonsed to the home and lied to he was very sympathetic to what Ms. McGagh was telling him. And offered her options. … [w]ouldn't he think the next time he's called to someone's house and there's the complaint of a sexual assault won't he remember Ms. McGagh. … The next person who actually makes a complaint to the police they're victims and I will tell you the justice system is a victim. We only this delicate fragile system only works because we depend on people to have their word mean something. … I have no doubt that had there not been video Mr. Trebay would be in jail because a jury would say why would she lie about this? … So I think not only Mr. Trebay not only the Commissioner not only the police officer … but the entire system brought to its knees because we as a system may have failed Mr. Trebay if there wasn't that video."" The trial court justified why its eight years and six months sentence exceeded the sentencing guidelines: ""Those [sentencing] guidelines do not take into account these facts and all of these victims and all of these lies and this history of dishonest and manipulative [ ] actions that show a complete and total disregard for the other humans that are walking this path…. I think this is one of the most serious and truly despicable crimes that I have witnessed when you consider the ripples of the damage that [has] been caused."" {In the sentencing hearing the State informed the court that Trebay would have faced up to eleven years' imprisonment for a second degree and fourth degree sexual assault.} [Sufficiency of the evidence:] The two-witness rule [recognized under Maryland law] describes the minimum evidence needed to establish the falsity of a statement…. ""The rule that testimony of a single witness is not sufficient to negative the alleged false oath is not merely technical but is founded on substantial justice. There must either be two witnesses to prove such falsity or one witness with material and independently established corroborative facts."" … The two-witness rule applies only to the falsity element. {The rule no longer requires two actual witnesses…. ""… It is enough that there is testimony of one witness and other independent corroborative evidence[.]"" Independent corroborative evidence comes in the form of documents video footage or other circumstantial evidence.} Here and similar to Hourie we ""clearly"" have sufficient evidence from Trebay's testimony the Verizon surveillance video and McGagh's admission in court for ""any rational trier of fact"" to find the falsity of McGagh's statements beyond a reasonable doubt. Trebay testified that he did not ""recall"" putting his hand on McGagh's breast or inner thigh. The Verizon surveillance video corroborated his testimony by also showing that the contact alleged by McGagh did not occur. McGagh also conceded during her colloquy with the trial court that the alleged touching did not occur [though she did not concede that she had deliberately lied about it]…. The Verizon surveillance video in this case also satisfies the purpose of the two-witness rule articulated in Brown. The two-witness rule prevents ""oath against oath"" by allowing the fact finder to observe and judge the credibility of witnesses offering competing recollections of events while comparing the witness statements against independent circumstantial evidence. The trial court here had the opportunity to judge and observe McGagh's and Trebay's testimony. The Verizon surveillance video provided independent corroboration of the pertinent factual dispute: whether Trebay cupped McGagh's breast and touched her inner thigh. The Court of Special Appeals found that the surveillance video's lack of sound created too much ambiguity to prove the falsity of McGagh's claims thereby adopting a too stringent reading of the two-witness rule. Evidence always contains some ambiguity but the two-witness rule does not require circumstantial evidence to be perfect. ""The test"" for whether evidence satisfies the two-witness rule is ""whether the evidence is of a quality to assure that a guilty verdict is solidly founded."" If other evidence is of ""equal weight"" to testimony by a witness it can satisfy the two-witness rule…. The State [also] provided sufficient evidence to satisfy the mens rea elements of McGagh's perjury and false statement convictions…. ""[T]he false [statement] must be deliberate and not the result of surprise confusion or bona fide mistake[.]"" Here the trial court found that McGagh exhibited … deliberate behavior …: ""I don't believe that [McGagh] was confused about what happened. It's far more likely that she wanted Mr. Trebay fired and the story started and was sort of like that proverbial snowball going down the hill it just got more ingrained and more elaborate but it was false."" The trial court rejected the possibility that McGagh alleged sexual assault by mistake: ""[I]t's not even a close call. He didn't cup her breast he didn't brush her breast he did not touch her breast or her chest in any way…. Which is frankly not an easy thing to do when one is wearing a very downy fleece or down vest which just you know it's thick and straight across your chest."" The trial court further observed that ""[Trebay] never got close to her upper inner thigh."" The trial court reasonably found that McGagh willfully and knowingly made a false statement when she alleged that Trebay sexually assaulted her by touching her breast and inner thigh.

The court also held that perjury convictions need not be reviewed de novo:

Maryland Rule 8-131(c) provides the standard for appellate review of bench trials: ""When an action has been tried without a jury the appellate court will review the case on both the law and the evidence. It will not set aside the judgment of the trial court on the evidence unless clearly erroneous and will give due regard to the opportunity of the trial court to judge the credibility of the witnesses."" … Maryland appellate courts accordingly adopt a deferential standard when reviewing sufficiency of evidence that asks whether ""any rational trier of fact could have found the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt."" … Maryland courts have always used the sufficiency of evidence standard to review perjury convictions. Perjury and false report convictions heavily depend on the fact finder's determination of credibility. The fact finder must intimately evaluate each party's story to assess who is telling the truth. The deferential standard of review recognizes trial courts' better position in making this determination. … ""Having lived with the case the trial judge views the situation in three dimension up close and personal not from a cold record; thus having closely observed the entire trial he or she is able to appreciate nuances inflections and impressions never to be gained from a cold record."" … In some cases this Court has supplemented the Jackson standard with a de novo review when a constitutional right is at issue. The independent examination ensures this Court's protection of fundamental rights. Our case law demonstrates the proper application of de novo review when the State through action or statute seeks to regulate or control protected speech [for instance in disorderly conduct or obscenity cases]…. In Polk the State charged the defendant with disobeying a lawful order after the defendant responded with a series of profanities to an officer's instruction to be quiet and leave the hospital. The case turned on whether the order attempted to control the content of her speech or her aggressive behavior at a hospital…. This Court conducted a de novo review to determine to what extent if any the officer's order violated the defendant's First Amendment right to free speech…. [But p]erjurious speech does not receive First Amendment protection. The Supreme Court explained in United States v. Alvarez: ""It is not simply because perjured statements are false that they lack First Amendment protection. Perjured testimony 'is at war with justice' because it can cause a court to render a 'judgment not resting on truth.' Perjury undermines the function and province of the law and threatens the integrity of judgments that are the basis of the legal system."" Unprotected speech renders unnecessary an independent review of the record for First Amendment violations. Here McGagh's First Amendment rights were not implicated in this case let alone violated. McGagh did not challenge the constitutionality of the perjury statute on its face or as applied to her. The Court of Special Appeals only suggested that the facts of the case ""arguably"" triggered a de novo review to evaluate First Amendment interests. The court reads too much of a First Amendment interest into the case. The case turns on whether the State presented sufficient evidence to prove the elements of perjury and false report; it does not turn on whether the State infringed upon her protected speech. Unlike in Polk v. State (Md. 2003) where this Court needed to determine whether an officer's order infringed on the defendant's right to speak (albeit vulgarly) McGagh does not claim the perjury and false report statutes infringed upon her right to petition the government for redress. It would similarly be unnecessary for us to conduct a constitutional analysis here as this Court did in Polk. Respondent never voiced any deterred ability to make a criminal complaint by threat of perjury. Even if McGagh had raised such concerns the perjurious content of McGagh's speech also means it lacks First Amendment protection…. Our holding in no way departs from this Court's previously acknowledged important public policy objective of encouraging women and all victims of sexual assault to bring their truthful sexual assault allegations to light. It also does not abridge an individual's First Amendment right to truthfully and in good faith report a sexual assault without punishment or intimidation even if the allegation is later shown to be mistaken confused or erroneous.

I don't think this appellate review analysis is quite spot on: It's true that perjury is unprotected speech obscenity libel fighting words and the like are unprotected speech too. But decisions whether certain speech qualifies as obscenity libel or fighting words are generally reviewed independently by appellate courts (see PDF pp. 5-9 of this article) precisely to make sure that only unprotected speech gets punished.

Nonetheless I think that the court may have gotten the result right as to the proper standard of appellate review. First Amendment independent appellate review generally applies to judgments whether certain facts satisfy the constitutional standard (e.g. whether a particular film lacks serious artistic value what sort of subjective knowledge qualifies as reckless disregard of the truth or whether certain words qualify as the sort of face-to-face insults that are likely to start a fight). It generally doesn't apply to witness credibility determinations where the question is what actually happened what was actually said or whether the speaker knew it was false:

In determining whether the constitutional standard has been satisfied the reviewing court must consider the factual record in full. Although credibility determinations are reviewed under the clearly-erroneous standard because the trier of fact has had the ""opportunity to observe the demeanor of the witnesses"" the reviewing court must ""'examine for [itself] the statements in issue and the circumstances under which they were made to see … whether they are of a character which the principles of the First Amendment … protect.'""

So deferring to the trial judge's judgment about the defendant's credibility might have been correct after all though I'm open to being persuaded otherwise.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdzbWFyZW5hLmNvbS9vbmVwbHVzXzhfZmluYWxseV9nZXRzX2FuZHJvaWRfMTFfdXBkYXRlX29uX3Zlcml6b25fYW5kX3Rtb2JpbGUtbmV3cy00NzQ4Ni5waHDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,OnePlus 8 finally gets Android 11 update on Verizon and T-Mobile,"Never settle? When it comes to updates for carrier-branded devices OnePlus is more like Sometimes settle. Or even - Always settle. We're talking about how long it takes carrier versions of its handsets to receive big new Android updates.

Case in point the OnePlus 8. Unlocked units have been bathing in the glory of Android 11 since mid-October. And yet if you bought one from Verizon or T-Mobile the rollout has only started today more than three months later.

That's... something. But hey it's better than nothing. So if you have a OnePlus 8 on Verizon or T-Mobile it may be time to check for an update. Of course that doesn't guarantee you'll get it since the rollout should be staged as usual. But at least it's rolling now so in a few days (or if you're really unlucky - weeks) you'll have Android 11 too. Just in time for Google to launch the first Android 12 beta. Shh don't tell OnePlus.

Anyway the new build is labeled IN2019_15_210110 for Verizon and it brings with it the (drum roll) November 2020 security patch level. We're going to pretend that's not superseded by not one but two newer security update levels (three on Monday) just like OnePlus is. You're also getting some improvements to 5G UWB things.

T-Mobile's build is 11.0.1.1.IN55CB and somehow this one has the December 2020 security patches. Better but still not current.

Somewhere former mayor Tom Menino is saying 'I told you so',"He laid out a new approach to developing the South Boston Waterfront describing it as “one that is both more deliberate and more experimental.”

In 2010 when much of the Seaport District was a sea of forlorn parking lots the long-serving mayor in what would be his final inaugural address rechristened the area the “Innovation District.”

We humored him even as banners proclaiming the rebranding were hoisted above sidewalks. The moniker never did stick but don’t think for a moment the most innovative companies would have found their way to the South Boston Waterfront on their own. The late mayor’s aspirations have come to fruition a transformation perhaps capped last week by Amazon’s announcement of a major expansion in the Seaport that would fill a planned tower with 3000 employees. That’s on top of the 2000 jobs the e-commerce giant is adding in an adjacent building already under construction.

The move will almost certainly kick up more interest in the area ― innovative companies like to feed off each other’s energy and talent by forming clusters. That’s exciting but the Seaport as a neighborhood is far from ideal. Let’s hope the attention generated by Amazon’s expansion spurs us to reckon with a major flaw: the Seaport’s lack of diversity and inclusiveness. The city’s newest neighborhood is also among its whitest as the Globe Spotlight Team reported in a 2017 series on Boston’s racial image and reality.

The real genius behind the origin of the Innovation District wasn’t the coining of an aspirational name but the strategy behind it. Rather than commissioning a study on whether tech types would flock to the waterfront the Menino administration took a page from the entrepreneurs they wanted to court: City Hall experimented.

“What we needed was to signal this place was new and different” said Mitch Weiss Menino’s former chief of staff.

That led to the fledgling MassChallenge startup competition moving from Kendall Square in 2010 into a rent-free space Menino brokered on Fan Pier. A year later the mayor proffered a set of controversial tax breaks for Vertex Pharmaceuticals enticing the biotech to abandon its Cambridge headquarters and break ground on a waterfront campus. In 2013 District Hall opened in a single-story steel-clad temporary building as a space where the tech crowd could work and hang out.

Back then the notion that the Seaport might in any way resemble much less rival Kendall Square ― biotech hub of the world ― was laughable. Even the most basic question could not be answered: Would young software engineers put up with the long walk to work from the nearest subway stop at South Station?

That’s why MassChallenge and District Hall proved as critical to the Seaport as the decision by Vertex to plant its flag there. They were real-time tests and their success would make more of a statement than the city trying to woo major corporate names through PowerPoint slides and expeditions to executives’ offices.

“I honestly believe if we had taken the strategy of ‘let’s go whale hunting’ the Seaport would have mostly languished as it had for the two decades prior” said Weiss now a professor at Harvard Business School.

In retrospect Menino’s timing ― intentional or not ― was impeccable. Developer Joe Fallon had just built an office tower on Fan Pier that was proving hard to fill because of the Great Recession. Across the river in Cambridge the founders of MassChallenge were on the hunt for more space and Vertex was on the verge of becoming a pharmaceutical powerhouse by bringing its first blockbuster drug to market.

Menino seized on the notion that this new neighborhood couldn’t simply be an extension of the city’s existing economy which was anchored by financial services firms insurance companies and health care institutions. There wouldn’t be enough growth in those sectors to fill the Seaport’s 1000 acres. Instead he looked to emerging players such as life sciences companies and tech startups.

Vertex was outgrowing the nearly dozen buildings it was leasing in East Cambridge. Moving to Boston would enable the company to put about 1200 employees in a pair of gleaming new towers overlooking Boston Harbor signaling to the world that the firm had arrived.

Not only did Menino offer tax breaks from the city but he convinced the state to pony up as well. All told Vertex stood to receive nearly $22 million in incentives to relocate from one Massachusetts city to another a lucrative package that did not go down well in some quarters.

“I struggled with that” said Greg Bialecki who was the state’s economic secretary at the time under Governor Deval Patrick. “That’s generally not good state policy. There were a handful of exceptions and this is one.”

Despite billions of federal dollars to clean up the harbor depress the Central Artery and build a third harbor tunnel to connect the Seaport to Logan Airport the South Boston Waterfront was failing to deliver on its promise of becoming the city’s next great neighborhood. The Patrick administration decided to get involved figuring what was good for Boston ultimately would in time be good for the state.

Patrick also believed government should help grow the rising stars of business. The Vertex deal came just as the governor’s $1 billion 10-year commitment to turbocharge the state’s life sciences industry was underway.

Cambridge officials squawked saying the Vertex move would cost them property tax revenue (not to mention jobs). But once Vertex left other biotech firms quickly took over its space.

“It wasn’t splitting the pie” said Bialecki. “It was really growing the pie.”

Menino’s timing was good for another reason: Innovation-driven sectors were about to experience an explosion of growth and Boston ― with its academic medical centers and research universities churning out talent ― was primed to capitalize.

Boston is what the Brookings Institution calls a “superstar” in tech-fueled industries such as software and pharmaceuticals. The metro region is one of five in the country along with San Francisco and Seattle that together captured about 90 percent of the nation’s innovation economy jobs in the last decade according to a Brookings analysis.

“Mayor Menino and Boston were ahead of the curve in intuitively creating new urban space just as the Internet social media and e-commerce wave was about to crest” said Mark Muro a senior fellow at Brookings. “They hit this just right by creating usable developable but very urban space at a time when big tech was concentrating in a short list of places.”

Rohit Prasad Amazon’s chief scientist for Alexa has been working in the Boston area for more than 20 years. He said the region’s focus on applied practical research — innovation in other words — is a big reason that the tech giant has expanded so much first in Kendall Square and now in the Seaport.

“It’s not just the tech talent it’s the culture of the place” he said. “The desire to take on challenges that impact millions and millions of lives.”

Menino may have been the driving force behind making the Seaport a tech and life sciences magnet but he needed developers to step up — and they did in a big way. In the summer of 2010 MassChallenge moved into a mostly empty building at Fallon’s One Marina Park Drive bringing with it 100-plus startups and more than 250 people brimming with cutting-edge ideas.

MassChallenge stayed for four rent-free years and by the time it moved on there was a waiting list for Fallon’s tower.

“I am sure a lot of the migration to the Seaport was inevitable but it definitely didn’t feel that way when we arrived in the Seaport” MassChallenge cofounder John Harthorne told me in an e-mail. “MassChallenge acted as an important catalyst for the Seaport and we definitely benefited from its growth as well. We really grew up together in many ways.”

District Hall was made possible when John Hynes original developer of the mixed-use Seaport Square project agreed to Menino’s request to build something for the tech scene and lease it for only a $1 a year. The mayor brought in the Cambridge Innovation Center to manage the space and oversee programming. District Hall opened in 2013 and in the last year before the pandemic it hosted more than 1700 events with 105000 attendees.

CIC has since brought the concept to Providence St. Louis and Warsaw Poland. Other cities around the world have studied District Hall.

“There was a fire about to happen down there anyway” said CIC president Brian Dacey but District Hall was “the spark.”

In 2014 Mayor Marty Walsh picked up where Menino left off and made sure MassChallenge and District Hall remained fixtures. The Seaport Square’s current developer WS Development plans to keep District Hall in place for at least another decade. MassChallenge moved to another part of the Seaport the Marine Industrial Park in yet another rent-free deal.

The list of prominent companies both established and up-and-comers that are expanding or have relocated to the Seaport is ever growing: Alexion Pharmaceuticals General Electric Foundation Medicine LogMeIn MassMutual and PTC.

The name “Innovation District” has been relegated to a footnote in the city’s history but the changes it helped inspire are all about the future.

A surge in online shopping helped the world’s biggest payment processor counter a hit to cross-border volumes from a global slowdown in travel and entertainment.

U.S. holiday sales jumped 8.3% last year to record their best growth in at least 19 years as consumers used their stimulus checks to splurge on gifts the National Retail Federation (NRF) said earlier this month.

Visa said total spending rose 5% on a constant dollar basis from a year earlier after dropping 10% in the previous quarter.

“U.S. holiday spending was quite different this year but had a similar overall growth to the last 3 years of holiday season” Chief Executive Officer Alfred Kelly Jr said.

Holiday retail spending growth broadly accelerated in Canada UK Brazil and Australia he added.

Visa’s shares gained 1.2% as the company said the number of processed transactions rose 4% and that it approved a new $8 billion share buyback program.

Cross-border volume slumped 21% from a year earlier but improved from the prior quarter when they crashed 47%.

Kelly cited travel between the U.S. to several countries in Latin America remained strong for the improvement with the UAE also attracting holiday-makers from Europe Russia and other Gulf countries.",,,,,,,,,

Dix

The Biden Administration has chosen an expert with Northeast Ohio roots to be its senior adviser for climate policy and to make an important start on President Biden’s commitment to green America’s electricity supply by 2035.

Sonia Aggarwal 36 will be senior adviser for climate policy and innovation in the White House. The co-founder of Energy Innovation a California-based think tank and the author of America’s Power Plan a series of research papers that explain how our country can decarbonize its electricity system Aggarwal will help Biden select policies to advance his climate goals all the while creating good paying jobs and supporting public health.

Currently a resident of Oakland California Aggarwal and her husband Jordan MacHardy an engineer specializing in robotics are relocating to the Washington D.C. area.

Interestingly Sonia Aggarwal spent her formative years growing up in Northeast Ohio where as the daughter of Raj and Karen Aggarwal both with Kent State University ties she attended Laurel School in Shaker Heights and Hawken School in Gates Mills. She went on to Haverford College in Philadelphia where she obtained her bachelor’s degree in Physics and Astronomy. She then received a master’s degree in engineering at Stanford University in Palo Alto.

E & E News a publication dedicated to providing essential news for energy and environment professionals has issued an assessment on Aggarwal that is glowing with praise.

It says Aggarwal in a report released last summer with the University of California Berkley argues the United States can actually save money by switching to low-carbon electricity sources. The report envisions a combination of solar wind and existing nuclear and hydropower plants enabling the nation to approach carbon neutrality. Scientists tell us that carbon dioxide produced by burning fossil fuels is the major culprit in creating global warming and climate change so the strategy she has recommended is important.

One of Aggarwal’s early jobs in energy came during her college years with a summer position at the Perry Nuclear Power Plant near Painesville. According to her father Aggarwal re-wrote and updated the plant’s safety manual and “as far as I know they are still using it today.”

E&E News quotes Mark Dyson of the Rocky Mountain Institute as saying in Aggarwal Biden has selected someone who can help solve issues of how to decarbonize the nation’s power grid. Whereas so many debates about greening the power sector stall over

issues of removing the last 10 to 20 percent of emissions from the grid the Berkley study that Aggarwal led shows how the United States can reduce power emissions by 90 percent through wind solar and battery storage. The study according to E&E News estimates the strategy would drive infrastructure investments of $1.7 trillion create 530000 jobs and save $1.2 trillion in health and environmental damages.

According to E&E News Aggarwal came to the attention of the Biden Administration partly because of her work on the advisory board for Evergreen Action a political action committee formed by former members of the administrative team of Washington State Gov. Jay Inslee who considers environmental issues critically important.

Her lifelong interest in science reflects the educational priorities of her parents. Her mother Karen Aggarwal now retired was a successful art therapist who holds a master’s degree in the field from Ursuline College and obtained her bachelor’s degree from Kent State which is where she met her husband.

Raj Aggarwal holds a doctorate in international finance from Kent State and served as dean of the College of Business at the University of Akron where he also held the Sullivan Chair in International Business and Finance. Well published in scholarly journals he has been employed by several multinational corporations for his expertise in global risk management. He has been a consultant for the World Bank the UN the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and several Fortune 100 Companies. He has served on the board of Manco Inc. Ancora Mutual Funds and the Financial Management Association.

In retirement he continues to serve on the boards of the Cleveland Council of World Affairs the Kent State University Foundation and Kent State’s Read Center for International and Intercultural Education where he and his wife have established an endowment to assist international students. He is also a member of the Financial Executive Research Foundation. He arrived in the USA in the late 1960s with a degree in mechanical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology an elite educational institution established by Jawaharlal Nehru after India won its independence from the British in 1947.

Fishing is one of humanity’s oldest activities.

On this planet where nearly three-quarters of the surface is water sea creatures have been a shared part of our species’ identity from our earliest days. It makes sense then that we would want to maintain a healthy promotion of our aquatic brethren to better their lives so that we can better ours.

“My father introduced me into the sport of fishing and conservation” said Glen Cascagnette a 59-year-old Midland resident. “If we threw paper on the ground or in the water a stern lecture soon followed.

“Fishing with my father was a little different from today; in those days we did not need a fishing licence nor did we have catch limits. But my father made sure we only took enough fish home for a meal"" he recalled.

“Once I got to about 10 years old I was allowed to fish without my father as long as I wore a life jacket. I was allowed to fish down at the old Grew Boats' manufacturing docks Penetang town docks and the shoreline which they now call Beck Boulevard” he said.



In 1984 at age 22 Cascagnette was asked to join a team of fishing guides in Great Bear Lake NWT.

“This is where I was introduced to a great fisheries of conservation slot sizes catch limits barbless hooks and only artificial baits” he explained. “When I got back to Georgian Bay (in 1988) I decided to challenge myself to only use artificial baits and how and when to present them; I no longer use live bait.”

Cascagnette’s conservation-minded perspective took hold not just to the water but to the ground as well.

“I also noticed a lot of garbage along the shorelines which included fishing line. So I would be constantly picking up garbage and fishing line.”

According to the Clear Your Gear website improperly discarded fishing line can last in the environment for up to 600 years and is the leading cause of entanglement issues for people property and wildlife.

Upon his return to the area Cascagnette attended Georgian College to study Marine and Small Engine Mechanics working in that field until pursuing a career with Raytheon Elcan Optical Technologies where he works to this day.

“I did some research” said Cascagnette “and found out that a guy from the Barrie area Matt Monkman started an internet site called 705 Anglers which was geared to fishing and conservation of the fisheries and noticed that he was inheriting an American idea of fishing-line recycle stations… introducing them to the Barrie and surrounding area.”

The company Cascagnette referred to is Berkley Canada a fishing-line manufacturer affiliated with the Berkley Conservation Institute.

Since 1990 roughly 14.5 million kilometres of donated fishing line from over 17000 recycling collection bins have been re-purposed into environmentally-conscious plastic products which primarily include fish habitats for wildlife and plant growth.

In 2017 several proposals were put forward to municipalities all across the Simcoe and Muskoka regions by 705 Anglers Club representatives pitching the installation of monofilament recycling containers at prominent fishing locations docks and launches along those waterfronts. The containers typically constructed of PVC were supplied to the municipalities at no cost thanks to Monkman.

Cascagnette contacted Monkman to receive six of the receptacles.

""Both (Penetang and Midland) accepted my proposals and agreed to install three units each in specific locations: town dock town boat launch and town waterfront park.

“I then collected the fishing line from each unit bi-weekly for the last four years. And I was totally shocked that I was collecting far more fishing line from the Midland stations than the Penetang stations” he exclaimed guessing at an unexplained difference of 90 percent between the two towns.

The three Penetanguishene recycling units have since been transferred and installed in Tay Township as part of a pilot project.



Once a full year’s worth of fishing line an estimated five pounds of line per season has been accrued within the recycling stations Cascagnette sends the donations in bulk to Berkley Canada.

“When I did my research of fishing line” Cascagnette recalled “I was brought to pictures of wildlife from turtles to birds killed by entanglement in those lines. So I thought I could do something locally.

“The gateway to Georgian Bay is such a beautiful area. This is one way to help keep it beautiful — safe for reptiles and birds — and recycle our wastes into everyday products. It’s a win-win for our generation and generations to come.”

Not just for our human generations either. There are aquatic species which owe an extension of life to Cascagnette’s efforts as well.

Taken as a whole it’s a win-win for our planet and it shows that just one person absolutely can make a difference.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvcmFjaGVsa3JhbWVyYnVzc2VsLzIwMjEvMDEvMzEvMTAtcm9tYW5jZS1ub3ZlbC1yZWNvbW1lbmRhdGlvbnMtZnJvbS1yZXZpZXdlcnMtYW5kLXBvZGNhc3RlcnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,10 Romance Novel Recommendations From Reviewers And Podcasters,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelkramerbussel/2021/01/31/10-romance-novel-recommendations-from-reviewers-and-podcasters/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvcmFjaGVsa3JhbWVyYnVzc2VsLzIwMjEvMDEvMzEvMTAtcm9tYW5jZS1ub3ZlbC1yZWNvbW1lbmRhdGlvbnMtZnJvbS1yZXZpZXdlcnMtYW5kLXBvZGNhc3RlcnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,

The BNSF Railway Company and Wabtec's exploration of the future potential of battery-electric locomotives crossed a significant milestone earlier this month when they began testing the technology in revenue service between Barstow and Stockton.

As BNSF seeks ways to further reduce its environmental impact the advancement of battery technology offers some possible solutions according to a press release.

""We've got everything in place and we're ready to see how this next-generation locomotive performs in revenue service"" said John Lovenburg BNSF vice president Environmental. ""BNSF is focused on continuing to reduce our environmental impact and we're committed to doing our part to test and assess the commercial viability of emerging technologies that reduce emissions.""

The battery-powered locomotive will be situated in a consist between two Tier 4 locomotives creating a battery-electric hybrid consist railway officials said. When running on the mainline both the battery-electric and diesel locomotives will power the train.

The battery-electric locomotive is expected to reduce the environmental impact from emissions along the route while improving fuel economy for the entire consist by at least 10%. The pilot test will run until the end of March. If it proves successful BNSF said it will look to expand testing to other locations and operating conditions on its system.

This initiative builds on BNSF's existing investments in sustainable technologies including idle control electric wide-span cranes battery-electric hostlers automated gates at its intermodal facilities and Tier 4 locomotives.

BNSF partnered with Wabtec on the development of the battery-electric locomotive which features an overall energy-management system including onboard energy storage that when coupled with advanced system-optimization controls will improve consist and train performance.

""The FLXdrive is the world's first 100-percent heavy-haul battery-electric locomotive that optimizes the total energy utilization of the entire locomotive consist"" said Alan Hamilton Wabtec vice president Engineering. ""This technology works in a manner very similar to how electric vehicles use regenerative braking. It's a significant step forward for the rail industry and will change the course for even cleaner more energy-efficient transport.""

The battery-electric locomotive pilot program is part of a $22.6 million grant awarded to BNSF and the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District from the Zero- and Near Zero-Emission Freight Facilities project by the California Air Resource Board to pilot several emissions-reducing technologies in and around railyards.

The project is part of California Climate Investments a statewide initiative that puts billions of Cap-and-Trade dollars to work reducing greenhouse gas emissions strengthening the economy and improving public health and the environment — particularly in disadvantaged communities.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5saXZlbWludC5jb20vYnVkZ2V0L2V4cGVjdGF0aW9ucy9wcm9kdWN0aW9uLWxpbmtlZC1pbmNlbnRpdmVzLWZvci1ncmVlbi1maWVsZC1icm93bi1maWVsZC1leHBhbnNpb24tZm9yLXJhaWwtc2VjdG9yLTExNjEyMDEwNDUzMjk5Lmh0bWzSAZcBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubGl2ZW1pbnQuY29tL2J1ZGdldC9leHBlY3RhdGlvbnMvcHJvZHVjdGlvbi1saW5rZWQtaW5jZW50aXZlcy1mb3ItZ3JlZW4tZmllbGQtYnJvd24tZmllbGQtZXhwYW5zaW9uLWZvci1yYWlsLXNlY3Rvci9hbXAtMTE2MTIwMTA0NTMyOTkuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PLI for green field / brown field expansion for rail sector: Sandeep Selot on Budget 2021 | Mint,"The Narendra Modi government will present the Union Budget on Monday and a lot is expected from the government to provide impetus to the infra sector especially after the economy took a hit due to covid-19.

In a 2018 speech at her alma mater Spelman College Rosalind Brewer the then-COO of Starbucks told the graduating class of the all-female historically Black college: ""We are still Black women in a white male world.""

For her those words still ring true. Recently named the incoming CEO of Walgreens Boots Alliance the parent company of pharmacy chain Walgreens Brewer is the only Black woman leading a Fortune 500 right now and just the third in modern history. Most of America's C-suite is white and male.

But the executive who goes by ""Roz"" is also an outspoken advocate for diversity equity and inclusion (DEI) and racial equity. Leadership consultants told Insider that Brewer is an example of an anti-racist leader. Antiracism is defined as the set of beliefs and actions that oppose racism and promote the inclusion and equality of Black and brown people in society.

The way Brewer speaks with candor about racial equity as well as some of the initiatives she's led shows that she's serious about making change.

Admitting when you're wrong and making it right

In 2018 Rashon Nelson and Donte Robinson both 23-year-old Black men were arrested while sitting in a Philadelphia Starbucks. The men were waiting for their business partner when a white female barista called the police on them.

Video of their arrest quickly went viral prompting protests and accusations of racism against the coffee chain and the police. At the time Brewer was the COO of Starbucks. In the days following the arrest she joined Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson in meeting with Nelson and Robinson to personally apologize. They also separately spoke out about the incident to local press condemning the events.

Brewer made a statement about the events showing how it impacted her personally.

""When I saw the video it sickened me because I began to think about my son who's 23 years old and lives in Brooklyn"" Brewer said. ""I immediately thought about him and his safety. Secondly I thought about what he must feel because my son is the kid that gets up on Saturday mornings and goes to Starbucks.""

Leadership consultant speaker and coach Arquella Hargrove told Insider that Brewer's tone and messaging in the Philadelphia store incident as well as other times she's spoken about racial equity show that she's serious about change.

""As an anti-racist advocate and leader she is communicating her stance with humility empathy and compassion which are also the characteristics of an inclusive leader fostering an inclusive environment"" Hargrove told Insider.

Beyond apologizing Brewer pledged action.

""We can look at this moment as a point in history – or as a transformation"" Brewer said.

A month later the company closed its US stores to conduct four hours of racial bias training for employees. The company then rolled out 12 more trainings over the following months on topics like empathy team building and inclusion. The coffee chain also updated its store policy to welcome non-paying guests to sit in its stores and use its restrooms.

The two men reached a private settlement with Starbucks for an undisclosed sum. They also received an offer of free college tuition to complete bachelor's degrees through an online program with Arizona State University a program created for Starbucks' employees.

Kailei Carr CEO leadership development firm The Asbury Group said Brewer's words and actions exemplified anti-racism at work. Brewer not only addressed the situation and admitted Starbucks was wrong but pledged companywide national action.

An outspoken advocate for DEI

Brewer is an outspoken advocate on racial and gender equity and she was openly discussing these issues when fewer executives were having conversations about DEI.

In a 2015 interview with CNN Brewer said she ""demanded"" diversity of her team. At the time she was the CEO of Sam's Club making her the first Black woman to lead a division within Walmart.

During that same interview she described a meeting with a supplier where all of the executives where white men.

""That was interesting"" she said adding that she was ""going to place a call"" to the supplier to talk about their team's lack of diversity.

In response people called Brewer a racist and encouraged a boycott of Sam's Club stores.

Soon after Doug McMillon Walmart's CEO issued a statement supporting Brewer.

""Roz was simply trying to reiterate that we believe diverse and inclusive teams make for a stronger business. That's all there is to it and I support that important ideal"" he said.

Brewer has proven time and time again to be a DEI advocate Carr said. Anti-racist leaders aren't afraid to call out injustices or systemic oppressive structures and to take action.

""I bet none of us will ever know all of the things she has done to chip away at the oppressive structures that have existed at her previous organizations"" Carr said.

In a 2020 TED Talk Brewer spoke out about corporate action in the wake of the killing of George Floyd calling on more executives to invest in Black and brown employees through mentorship and sponsorship programs.

America's C-suites will continue to lack diversity unless executives invest in programs to develop talent from marginalized communities and focus on inclusion Brewer said.

Hargrove said the incoming Walgreens CEO takes a clear stand on diversity and inclusion and makes those tenants a priority.

""Bottom line she is showing the actions of a CEO dedicated to leaving a DEI footprint"" she said.

During a time of virus misinformation and a spiking number of COVID-19 cases testing accessibility is paramount.

Studies have shown that widespread COVID-19 testing is vital to slowing down the coronavirus pandemic. But depending on the time of year and where you live accessing these tests may be difficult and lines could end up being hours long.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

As a result the at-home COVID-19 testing kit market is becoming saturated and many big-name retailers like Amazon and Walmart are now starting to sell these kits as well.

I decided to try the mail-in COVID-19 tests that are now being offered through Walmart and Amazon and found that the testing kit being sold by Amazon was superior for several reasons.

On December 3 Walmart said it would begin offering MyLab Box's mail-in COVID-19 tests. One month later Amazon announced it would do the same with DxTerity's COVID-19 testing kit. Both kits have been authorized by the Food and Drug Administration under its Emergency Use Authorization.

I decided to try both tests. See what the experience was like:

The type of tests and the price

DxTerity and MyLabBox's mail-in COVID-19 testing kit. Brittany Chang/Insider

I ordered Amazon's DxTerity and Walmart's MyLab Box COVID-19 test saliva collection kits. Walmart also carries MyLab Box's nasal swab kit and both the saliva and nasal swabs kits can be ordered with standard or express shipping. In the interest of pricing and testing consistency I ordered the MyLabBox saliva kit with standard shipping.

Advertisement

The price made me wince. Both cost me $118.53 which is hefty compared to the free testing clinics near me. While you're obviously paying for convenience it would be hard for anyone who doesn't live a financially cushioned life to take these at-home tests frequently.

I ordered my Amazon and Walmart kits on the same day and created my MyLab Box account the day after with a code I had received from Walmart.

You won't need to use either of the e-commerce platforms after placing your order: DxTerity and MyLab Box both handle the shipment and processing of their respective kits.

Amazon's DxTerity kit arrived on my doorstep before Walmart's MyLab Box. After receiving the packages I registered both kits on their respective websites so I could later view my COVID-19 test results.

Both MyLab Box and DxTerity test-takers can register their kit using the ID code found on the saliva collection tube. Luckily setting up the accounts only took a few minutes.

If you've never taken an at-home COVID-19 saliva test before the process is simple. To boil it down all you have to do is spit into a test tube and mail the tube back to its lab by dropping it off at a FedEx drop box. MyLab Box samples can also be delivered to a UPS depot.

Walmart's MyLab Box can provide results within 48 hours after the lab receives the sample while Amazon's DxTerity results are ready within 72 hours.

MyLab Box's coronavirus test is accurate for people who have COVID-19 symptoms according to the FDA letter authorizing its use. While I had feared exposure on my airplane ride and had a mild sore throat while ordering the tests I didn't have any additional symptoms when I was taking the test.

While DxTerity is also accurate it might miss some COVID-19 cases in people who are asymptomatic according to documents the maker filed with FDA. This is common in other COVID-19 tests as well and is why experts say receiving a negative test alone might not be enough for those looking to travel or visit family members.

Walmart's testing kit: MyLab Box. A surprising struggle.

MyLab Box's mail-in COVID-19 testing kit. Brittany Chang/Insider

Both MyLab Box and DxTerity's testing instructions state that test-takers shouldn't eat drink or smoke anything 30 minutes before taking the saliva sample. As a morning coffee consumer taking two COVID-19 tests at 7 a.m. I found this protocol a bit hard to adhere to but I'm obviously just complaining about the small things now.

The MyLab Box came with:

instructions

a lab requisition form that asks for your personal information

a mailing return label

a test tube for my saliva sample

a biohazard specimen collection bag with a small presumably absorbent sheet inside

a small box to put my test tube in

a UPS bag used to mail my sample to the lab

There was also a small sheet inside the UPS bag but I assumed this was also another absorbent sheet.

After reading the instructions and filling in the lab requisition form I opened up the test tube to begin the sample collection process.

Taking the saliva sample is easy: all you have to do is spit into the test tube until you hit the fill line. Luckily the tube came with a helpful little funnel to prevent a spit spray from missing the tube (you're welcome for that imagery). I then capped the funnel lid — which released a stabilizing solution into my sample— replaced the funnel top with the provided cap and shook the tube for five seconds as per the instructions.

MyLab Box's mail-in COVID-19 testing kit Brittany Chang/Insider

This is where it gets confusing.

The instructions say to place the test tube in the biohazard collection bag seal the bag up put the bag in the box place the absorbent sheet on top and then close the box.

However the graphic next to these instructions showed something different. Here the specimen bag and test tube look like they're about to be placed on top of some bubble wrap inside the box and the absorbent sheet looks like it's near the UPS bag but not about to be placed inside the box.

Bubble wrap? I never received bubble wrap in my package.

The instructions also didn't mention what to do with the second sheet. Was the smaller sheet found inside the specimen collection bag supposed to stay inside the bag? Or was that the sheet that was supposed to be placed on top of the bag inside of the closed box? And if the latter is the case what do I do with the larger sheet that came inside the UPS bag?

Confused I ended up placing the smaller sheet on top of the specimen bag and inside the box while leaving the larger sheet inside the UPS bag. This felt wrong but the instructions weren't clear enough to guide me in the right direction.

I slid the closed box — filled with the smaller absorbent sheet and the collection bag with my spit-filled test tube — into the UPS bag along with the larger sheet and sealed the package closed.

I was paranoid I had messed up the test but decided to move forward.

Amazon's testing kit: DxTerity. Pleasantly straightforward.

DxTerity's mail-in COVID-19 testing kit. Brittany Chang/Insider

Now onto Amazon's DxTerity kit.

The kit came with:

instructions

a test tube

a specimen collection plastic bag with a small white absorbent sheet

Saliva collection with DxTerity's kit is also straightforward: just spit into the test tube until your saliva reaches the thin sqiggly line. Like MyLab Box's test DxTerity's test tube also came with a handy funnel.

And yes after spitting into two test tubes I was parched.

As per the instructions after my spit reached the line I replaced the funnel with a ""fluid cap"" which released the blue ""viral RNA inactivation and stabilization solution"" into my collection of saliva.

Afterward I tightened the cap shook the tube for five seconds and dropped it into the specimen bag. This time the instructions told its test takers to keep the absorbent sheet inside the bag.

Unlike the MyLab Box kit the DxTerity saliva sample can be sent to the lab directly in the box that it came in. No need for a new label or a separate UPS bag. All I had to do was put the test tube inside the sample bag place the sample bag inside the box seal the box and then send the box full of my spit off.

Drop off was easy — I live near several FedEx drop boxes

Comparing the mail-in COVID-19 testing kits sold on Amazon and Walmart. Brittany Chang/Insider

With my two packages ready to go I looked up the closest FedEx drop boxes near me. Luckily finding a drop box was pretty easy and I was able to send my packages off in the morning well before the box's collection time. Time to say goodbye to my test kits and hello to my water bottle.

Results

Comparing the mail-in COVID-19 testing kits sold on Amazon and Walmart. Brittany Chang/Insider

Results from in-person testing sites near me will often come back within 48 hours. I didn't get this same perk with either of my mail-in tests.

However one test result came back much faster than the other.

I completed and dropped off both tests on January 19 and received an email from DxTerity on January 21 notifying me of my COVID-19 results. Delighted by the quick results I logged onto my DxTerity profile and was relieved to see ""negative."" According to my result paperwork my collection's accession date was on January 20 hence the fast turnaround time.

However MyLab Box which had already caused me some grief during the testing process was not as quick. Walmart states that the kit can provide results within 24 to 48 hours after the lab has received the sample but this was not the case.

Seven days after mailing in my test I finally received an email from MyLab Box on January 26 notifying me of my COVID-19 test result. But when I clicked on my negative results to read the report I was confused. The document said my test was collected on January 9 and reported on January 22. It also stated that my testing report was generated on January 29.

When asked about the result turnaround time MyLab Box's customer service manager told Insider in an email that the majority of its tests have a 24 to 48 hour result turnaround time but on ""rare occasions"" this may differ due to shipping delays and demand spikes.

""We are all living in unprecedented times which pose many unexpected challenges to delivery services health facilities and our staff alike"" the email read. ""We pride ourselves on our rapid turnaround time in fact it is a key performance metric we hold ourselves accountable to both internally and our valued partners nationwide.""

Advertisement

And in regards to the test result report the company says the dates are ""mainly intended for internal monitoring and some reporting purposes.""

At this time all labs are required to report both positive and negative COVID-19 test results to help the department of health track and manage the pandemic"" the email continued.""

My final verdict: Amazon's DxTerity is the winner

DxTerity's mail-in COVID-19 testing kit. Brittany Chang/Insider

After taking both tests I can confidently say that I prefer Amazon's DxTerity test over Walmart's MyLab Box due to DxTerity's straightforward instructions and result turnaround time.

At-home coronavirus tests offer convenience that can't be found by going to a clinic in-person. For starters the testing kit is mailed to your doorstep which means you don't have to walk or drive to a nearby testing facility. And if you're in a rush to get a test but can't book a time slot or can't wait in line mail-in kits may be your next best option.

However given the price of these two kits I would rather go to a testing facility than order another mail-in test."

The Jungle Cruise was a day one attraction at both theme parks and as such millions of people have ridden the attraction over the last 65 years. While this won't be the first major change for the ride since its inception it will be the first we've seen in a long time. However the change is the perfect time to introduce domestic Disney fans to a cast of characters that many in North America aren't that familiar with: the Society of Explorers and Adventurers.

The Society of Explorers and Adventurers is essentially the Disney Parks equivalent of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. At least it was before Disney Parks starting building its own Marvel Universe. It's a collection of original characters who are built into the story of several different theme park attractions. However since most of those theme park attractions are found in Disney's parks in Asia many who haven't been able to visit those may not even be aware that they exist.

The New Jungle Cruise Story (As Far As We Know)

Specifics concerning the new Jungle Cruise story are being kept mostly under wraps but we do know a few details. First and foremost it will be a single cohesive story rather than the loose collection of jungle scenes the ride is today. We also know that one particular scene which includes a collection of explorers who have been chased up a tree by a rhinoceros will be expanded upon.

In the new story these explorers will have names and backgrounds and specific specialties. We'll learn what they were doing on their own Jungle Cruise and how they ended up that tree in the first place. The identities of these characters have not been revealed and they may not even have been set yet but it would pretty cool to see this expedition become one sponsored by the SEA. These could be new members of the SEA or interns. Or maybe this could actually bring all the SEA characters together in some way. But what exactly is the Society for Explorers and Adventurers?

Tokyo DisneySea/Tower of Terror

It started in 2001 with the opening of Tokyo Disney Resort's second gate Tokyo DisneySea. Among the attractions built in the new park was a version of the popular Tower of Terror. However because The Twilight Zone wasn't a major export to Japan and thus had no name recognition the decision was made to give this version of the Tower of Terror a new completely original story.

The Hotel Hightower was built by a man named Harrison Hightower III who was a collector of antiquities that he didn't always come by honestly. Once while traveling down the Congo River Hightower met the native Mtundu people and stole their Shiriki Utundu idol for his own collection. Due to the lack of respect when Hightower showed the idol it came to life while in his hotel penthouse cursing the building and leading to the events of the attraction.

Considering the story of the Hightower Hotel even includes a trip down the Congo River we could actually see a direct connection between those events and the new attraction. According to concept art the boat the characters in the new version of the the Jungle Cruise will use is the Kongo Kate.

Other Disney Parks Connections

Numerous other members of the Society of Explorers And Adventurers have been introduced over the years. Lord Henry Mystic owns Mystic Manor the Hong Kong Disneyland version of the Haunted Mansion. Tokyo DisneySea has a unique version of the Soarin attraction called Fantastic Flight which includes a woman named Camilla Falco who is also a member of the group.

There are a handful of references to members of the Society of Explorers and Adventurers at Walt Disney World but they're not part of major attractions. Or at the very least attention isn't drawn to them so they can easily be missed. The Skipper Canteen restaurant includes art on the walls and other memorabilia referencing many of the members. Magic Kingdom's queue for Big Thunder Mountain Railroad includes references to Barnabas T. Bullion who is also a member but the ride itself doesn't deal with this and other versions of the attraction don't include these references at all.

The Jungle Cruise Connection

There is however a direct connection between the existing Jungle Cruise and the Society of Explorers and Adventurers. Dr. Albert Falls the man for whom the Jungle Cruise's famous ""backside of water"" was named is also a member of the group. The Dr. Falls joke predates the SEA by quite a while but he was retroactively added to the group. And since we can be sure that the backside of water will remain part of the attraction there's every reason to make Dr. Falls a bigger part of the story of the Jungle Cruise.

The Society of Explorers and Adventurers is a really fun concept created by Walt Disney Imagineering. Considering how many attractions in the last few years have been rethemed to incorporate a Disney movie tie-in we should be encouraging more original storytelling within the parks. Since the SEA don't really have their own attraction at either Walt Disney World or Disneyland it's time to give them one and the Jungle Cruise is a perfect choice. Whenever a major attraction is updated to include movie references fans tend to get upset feeling that such thing is inherently less creative. In this case we know that while the new Jungle Cruise might make reference to upcoming film it won't be based in that story.

Once the SEA is introduced to a wider audience the opportunities to do so much more with it only grow. When more people realize there are other attractions out there connected to this story they'll want to check those out and of course with any popular characters come the opportunity for new merchandise.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndkd2luZm8uY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQtMi9qYWNrLXBsb3RuaWNrLXNwb29mcy13YWx0LWRpc25leXMtd29uZGVyZnVsLXdvcmxkLW9mLWNvbG9yL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jack Plotnick Spoofs “Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color”,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.wdwinfo.com/entertainment-2/jack-plotnick-spoofs-walt-disneys-wonderful-world-of-color/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndkd2luZm8uY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQtMi9qYWNrLXBsb3RuaWNrLXNwb29mcy13YWx0LWRpc25leXMtd29uZGVyZnVsLXdvcmxkLW9mLWNvbG9yL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNsaWNrb3JsYW5kby5jb20vdGhlbWUtcGFya3MvMjAyMS8wMS8zMS9tbXMtc3RvcmUtb3BlbnMtYXQtZGlzbmV5LXNwcmluZ3Mv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,M&M's store opens at Disney Springs,"ORLANDO Fla – Mars Wrigley the world’s largest candy maker famous for its M&M brand is celebrating the opening of its newest M&M store at Disney Springs.

The family of J.J. Boatman say he was known for his big bear hugs.

""He was a loving caring little boy. Like every time he would see you or any family member he would run up and hug you"" J.J.'s uncle Gabriel Ayala said.

J.J. celebrated his ninth birthday just a few weeks ago with tacos and cake according to family.

""We never knew this was going to be his last birthday"" said Ayala.

Ayala says the little boy had asthma but was still very active. He said the young boy was always playing with his cousins or older sisters.

""He was just running around and playing earlier that day and by the nighttime he was yelling and crying to his mom that he couldn't breathe. His mom went over and his face was blue already and his lips were blue"" said Ayala.

According to his uncle J.J. was care-flighted from his home in Vernon to Cook Children's Medical Center in Fort Worth.

By the time he arrived his lungs were filled with fluid.

Ayala said the doctors told his mother that J.J. died from complications related to COVID-19.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention children don't typically get as sick with COVID as adults but it can happen.

""She didn't know that she was going to come home empty-handed without her son. It's just hard of course. That was her baby boy. That was her only son"" Ayala said.

J.J.'s uncle said he hopes people continue to take the threat of COVID seriously.

""We're going to miss his whole life. Going to miss his whole life. His life hadn't even started"" said Ayala.

The PGA Tour heads to the desert for the 2021 Waste Management Phoenix Open from TPC Scottsdale Arizona. Here’s your 2021 Waste Management Phoenix Open gambling preview – everything to know about the tournament before placing a single wager.

2021 Waste Management Phoenix Open Field

Making his debut at the Waste Management Phoenix Open is the biggest name in the field. Rory McIlroy makes his first trip to TPC Scottsdale in his storied career. Rory is coming off two solid starts to his 2021 campaign and hopes to win the tournament in his first start.

Another big name in the field is Jon Rahm who is the local favorite with the fans. Rahm attended Arizona State and parlays his popularity with terrific play at the event. Rahm has never finished worse than 16th at TPC Scottsdale. He also finished 5th as an amateur in 2015. Rahm looks to win for the first time at TPC Scottsdale.

Other notables in the field include Rickie Fowler Brooks Koepka Hideki Matsuyama Xander Schauffele Webb Simpson Justin Thomas and Bubba Watson.

The Golf Course

The property of TPC Scottsdale holds two golf courses both of which were co-designed by Tom Weiskopf and Jay Morrish. The commissioner of the PGA Tour in 1986 directed the two architects to build another golf resort for the TPC network that had the look and feel of TPC Sawgrass. Out of this endeavor gave rise to the Champions Course and the Stadium Course. The Stadium Course will host the tournament all four rounds. This is a relief for gamblers who were tormented by multi-course formats the previous two weeks.

TPC Scottsdale is likely on the bucket list for more mainstream golf fans based solely on the insanity of the 16th hole alone. But the dirty little secret about TPC Scottsdale is for the most part it’s a bland mediocre cookie cutter golf course. This is typically a stigma of most TPC golf courses.

There’s very little that piques my interest about TPC Scottsdale over the first fourteen holes. It suffers from a lot of the pitfalls that the South Course at Torrey Pines did last week. There are lots of similar looking Par 4’s. Almost all of them play straight ahead with a bunker near the fairway landing zone.

There’s not many decisions to make off the tee. Everything is very much out in front of the player. Unlike the South Course at Torrey Pines though most guys should be able to get good contact on the golf ball if they find the rough. The rough at TPC Scottsdale is only 2.25″ thick. But like the South Course the golf course is a straight forward game of execution.

The golf course starts to get interesting at the 15th. It’s a 553 yard Par 5 featuring an island green that’s reachable in two. While an island green is a bit gimmicky it presents the first interesting feature on the golf course.

From the tee box the golfers will begin to hear the madness reverberating from the grandstands of the 16th. They’ll need to tune out the noise and hit a solid tee shot. With water all down the left it’s an intimidating visual. It’s also very important to card a birdie here if one wants to win the tournament. Rickie Fowler birdied it in the final round on his way to overtaking Branden Grace for the victory. Gary Woodland carded a birdie on the 15th in three out of four rounds on his way to win the tournament in 2018. Hideki Matsuyama birdied it six out of eight tries on his way to winning back to back in 2016 and 2017. And Brooks Koepka eagled this hole in the final round of the 2015 event to help him capture his first career win on the PGA Tour.

After that is the infamous Par 3 16th. For 361 days of the year its a very non-descript hole. On its own the hole is quite a stress-less endeavor. It plays as little as 115 yards and as much as 160 into a simple two-tiered green. Its defense are four greenside bunkers to present the only challenge.

But when you surround the hole with a giant frat party attended by 20000 drunks who’ll boo if you miss the green it makes the tee shot a whole lot more nerve-wracking.

If you’re reading this article you already know exactly what the 16th offers. So instead of regurgitating the same cliches and jokes about the 16th that everyone will make here’s a video from the guys at No Laying Up that accurately sums up the vibe:

Due to COVID restrictions only 5000 fans will be in the stands at the 16th this week. That’s at about 25% normal capacity. But even with the limited spectators their presence will give this tournament plenty of energy.

For those who’d rather go watch golf instead of take funnels of Miller Light from sunup to sundown the place to be is the Par 4 17th. This is the best and most exciting hole on the golf course. It’s a high risk high reward hole where tournaments are won and lost.

Pros have two options when they step to the tee at the downhill 332 yard 17th. They can either layup down the rightside of the fairway past the centerline bunker and set up an easy approach into the large green. That’ll ensure at worst walking off the green with a par. It’ll also earn a few boos from those waking up from their early afternoon alcohol coma.

Or they could pull out a three-wood or driver and attempt to drive the green. The reward is very big. Those who successfully drive the green have a great opportunity at carding an eagle or two putting for birdie. It’s also the site of the only hole in one on a Par 4 in PGA Tour history:

There’s downsides to both strategies. Those who lay up run the risk of walking away without a birdie. The hole annually plays under par so it’s crucial to card a birdie so you don’t lose strokes to the field. Pros would rather two putt for birdie instead of trying to get up and down for one from off the green. In 2020 Tony Finau choose to lay up on 17 while leading in the final round. He unfortunately found the centerline bunker short of the green. Finau was unable to get up and down for birdie which allowed Webb Simpson back into the tournament. He would later go on to lose to Simpson in the playoff.

There’s much more downside to going for the green though. Water awaits those who miss left of the fairway. Branden Grace ended his chances to win in 2019 by sending his tee shot left into the drink. There’s also water behind the green. Anyone who overcooks their tee shot runs the risk of running through the green and into the drink. Poor Rickie Fowler did just that in 2016 while leading the tournament. He would later lose to Hideki Matsuyama in a playoff.

The tournament wraps up at the 442 yard 18th. It’s a dog-legged left Par 4 with water down the left side. This is a very common template for a finishing hole at TPC golf courses:

To the right are a trilogy of fairway bunkers in the landing zones for everyone. To the left is a row of church pew bunkers that probably aren’t in play for anyone. It would take a very aggressive line to play a fade over the water towards the left side of the fairway to even reach it. They’re mostly just there as eye-candy. Still with all the challenges presented off the tee it sets up drama should the tournament still not be decided down the stretch.

2021 Waste Management Phoenix Open Gambling Strategies

Despite an overabundance of fairway and water hazards TPC Scottsdale isn’t a tremendously difficult golf course. The winning score typically is in the mid to high teens with a cut line around Even or -1. Scoring can get a little tough if Scottsdale sees some cooler temperatures rain or wind. The last two years saw tough final round scoring conditions. Rain and cold made things a tough go for the contenders in 2019. Wind swept the golf course in 2020 and made the greens play very firm.

This year’s tournament looks to be shaping up like last year’s. Comfortable temperatures and brilliant sunshine will bathe the golf course the first three days. Winds will also be quite calm. On Sunday however winds are forecast to gust up to 25 MPH. That should help the golf course play quite firm and make greens less receptive.

Generally speaking players who hit it long and straight have an advantage at TPC Scottsdale. The pitfalls at the golf course are very evident to the player from each tee box but a lot of trouble can be bombed over by a longer player. A long player may also hit a more accurate three wood to make sure they avoid any bunkers they can’t hit over. Their club head speed puts them in Position A without sacrificing too much distance to the field.

That doesn’t mean a shorter more accurate player is behind the eight ball like they were at Torrey Pines South last week. There’s still a premium for hitting fairways at the golf course. The golf course has wider corridors than Torrey Pines did last week. The field average on driving accuracy at TPC Scottsdale is about the same as the PGA Tour average. Missing fairways brings a bit of a penalty to the players this week. Shorter hitters like Webb Simpson have found success at the golf course with a tremendous display of accuracy off the tee. He then parlayed this by taking advantage of playing from the fairway with his all-world iron play.

That’s one of the reasons why both driving distance and accuracy are prevalent among those towards the top of the leaderboard:

(Per DataGolf)

Solid ball strikers find a ton of success at TPC Scottsdale no matter how they do it. Bombers can sacrifice fairway accuracy with the ability to bomb past the hazards and have a wedge out of the overseeded rough. They’ll just have to make sure on holes where they can’t hit over the bunkers to club down. Short hitters have plenty of room off the tee to set up a mid-iron into large greens. Their strengths with the irons also will come in handy should the greens play firm like they did last year.

These formulas for success are further demonstrated for those who have the most success at the tournament. Here’s a list of players in the field who have gained over a stroke per round at TPC Scottsdale (minimum of 12 rounds):

Hideki Matsuyama: +2.87

Jon Rahm: +2.28

Xander Schauffele: +2.13

Byeong Hun An: +2.09

Bubba Watson: +1.95

Justin Thomas: +1.89

Webb Simpson: +1.82

Matt Kuchar: +1.82

Rickie Fowler: +1.81

Brendan Steele: +1.67

Brooks Koepka: +1.61

Daniel Berger: +1.60

Jordan Spieth: +1.34

Scott Piercy: +1.32

Gary Woodland: +1.31

J.B. Holmes: +1.30

Zach Johnson: +1.24

Russell Knox: +1.23

Billy Horschel: +1.20

Hunter Mahan: +1.14

Harris English: +1.12

Martin Laird: +1.01

This list comprises a wide variety of players. It’s a mix full of bombers short tacticians and all around good players. The common link is that they’re very efficient tee-to-green and are overall very solid ball strikers. Sticking to this simple formula for your player targets should pay dividends.

The last angle to consider in our Waste Management Phoenix Open gambling guide is the grass type. Many people make the mistake of assuming this is a Bermudagrass golf course. Like the American Express the golf course is overseeded during the winter months. The golf course was overseeded in the fall and will remain this way until at least May. Over the top of dead dormant Bermudagrass is a lush layer of emerald green Bentgrass. The greens are overseeded with a mixture of both Bentgrass and Poa.

For those who like consulting putting performance by grass types the tournaments to target are those with Bent/Poa mixtures. It includes the following tournaments:

Safeway Open (Silverado Resort)

The American Express (PGA West Stadium Course)

Genesis Open (Riviera Country Club)

The Memorial (Muirfield Village)

The Travelers Championship (TPC River Highlands)

Referencing putting performance on Bermudagrass golf courses is not advised. Instead consult these tournaments when looking at putting performance on overseeded greens. The greens at TPC Scottsdale in its current condition resemble more to the greens at the golf courses listed above.

Once while I was relaxing in my stateroom on a Royal Caribbean cruise ship my daughter asked where her poop went after she flushed the toilet and it is actually a good question.

Cruise ships are often described as floating cities and their waste management is no different than a small municipality.

With thousands of people onboard a ship there is a need for a sophisticated approach to managing where everything goes once people are done with it from human waste to recycling to leftover food.

In fact cruise lines are highly-regulated and work with environmental government agencies to ensure their waste practices are approved. These protocols ensure ships comply with strict requirements set out by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and other regional and national authorities with a responsibility to protect the environment.

Trash

Royal Caribbean touts the fact Symphony of the Seas the world's largest cruise ship is actually a zero-landfill ship. This means the ship can deal with their own waste ranging all the way from recycling to water filtration.

Cruise ships like Symphony have a designated waste and recycling center. There are separate teams to deal with each incoming recyclable: glass cardboard plastic and metal.

The ship's waste incineration room is manned twenty four hours a day by crew members who differentiate glass based on its color: green brown and white.

It is then sent for being crushed.

The ship has an incinerator as well as a compactor for processing plastic waste. The compactor crushes approximately 528 gallons of water bottles.

Once the ship returns to port it can then transport plastic aluminum paper and glass for recycling through a third party vendor.

In 2018 Royal Caribbean recycled 43.7 million pounds of waste.

Food

If you have been on a cruise ship you have noticed there is always plenty of uneaten food. Either food people leave on their plates or food that is never picked up from the buffet or ordered at a restaurant.

The chefs on Symphony of the Seas segregate food scraps into different buckets which is then put into a big pipe that leads to the ship’s hydro-processor for incineration.

Incinerating food waste reduces the volume of the leftover food waste and that reduces the ship's weight and thus fuel needed by the ship.

Where your poop goes

Time to tackle my daughter's question of where your poop shower water and any other wastewater goes.

Cruise ships have a water-treatment system onboard similar to your hometown. With over 7000 passengers and crew Symphony of the Seas generates 210000 gallons of black water and one million gallons of grey water during a one week cruise.

All the wastewater onboard is collected and absolutely nothing goes overboard unless it is first run through a treatment plant.

Water is divided into three categories:

Grey water: sinks laundries and drains

Black water: galleys and toilets

Bilge water: oils released from equipment in engine compartments that collect at the bottom of the vessel.

Wastewater is run through the advanced wastewater-purification plant on the ship which is above the US federal standard for purified water.

When black water enters the integrated treatment system it first passes into a bioreactor ‘aeration chamber’ which is filled with bacteria that break down organic contaminants dissolved in the wastewater.

The sewage then enters a membrane filtration system to further filter impurities. In the ‘settlement chamber’ dense substances sink to the bottom and the water floats to the top. The residual sludgy material is repeatedly returned for reprocessing. At the end of the cycles the remaining material is disposed of in low-emission incinerators.

Finally the clean sewage enters the ‘disinfection chamber’ where any remaining pathogens are sterilized by UV radiation. This leaves clean safe and bacteria-free water which is transferred to a storage tank until it can be discharged.

Believe it or not this water is near tap-water quality. The water is either kept on board or discharged overboard when the cruise ship is at sea with a certain distance from land in order to meet the different local and international regulations. The ability to discharge water depends on where the ship is located as some oceans and areas prohibit the practice.

Grey water can be discharged far out to sea after minimal treatment because it rarely includes harmful bacteria. Just like black water it can only be discharged at sea in areas that are not designated environmentally sensitive regions.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimwFodHRwczovL2tkaG5ld3MuY29tL2hhcmtlcl9oZWlnaHRzX2hlcmFsZC9sb2NhbC9oZWlnaHRzLXJlc2lkZW50cy1tdXN0LWFkanVzdC10by1uZXctZ2FyYmFnZS1waWNrdXAtcnVsZXMvYXJ0aWNsZV85YTI1MmRkYS02MzFhLTExZWItYmU1Yy1iNzFhMGZlMWYyNjIuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Heights residents must adjust to new garbage pickup rules,"Killeen TX (76540)

Daesung chair addresses the hoopla and presents vision

This year the world seems to be slowly recovering from the unprecedented global pandemic. At the same time the global energy industry landscape is shifting quickly with countries phasing out fossil fuels affecting every industry.Younghoon David Kim Daesung Group chairman said we are currently in a major energy transition where the next-generation industrial revolution is in progress.Chairman Kim is a major figure in the global energy industry as not only the World Energy Council honorary chairman but also a member of the President’s National Council on Climate Change and Air Quality headed by former United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon.“Decarbonization decentralization and digitalization is currently in progress” Kim said. “Because [energy] innovation is happening at a rapid pace the next industrial revolution will be much more dramatic than the first two.”In December 2020 Kim became the recipient of the Silver Tower Order of Industrial Service Merit — the highest accolade given by the government to a Korean energy company.Not only was his contribution in raising Korea’s reputation in the international community acknowledged but his work in pioneering renewable energy was also noted.Kim began his involvement with the World Energy Council (WEC) when he became WEC’s regional vice chair for Asia Pacific and South Asia in 2005 and subsequently served as the organization’s chair between 2016 and 2019. The World Energy Council is the world’s largest non-governmental energy organization.Daesung Group was founded by Kim’s father Kim Soo-keon and started off manufacturing briquettes. The company later expanded its businesses to include coal mining LPG petroleum natural gas and renewable energy.Kim is the third son of the founder and now runs Daesung Holdings Daesung Energy Daesung Eco-Energy and Daesung Private Equity. Daesung also is the sole operator of Skype in Korea.Kim earned a law degree from Seoul National University a master's in comparative law and business administration from the University of Michigan as well as a master's in theology from Harvard Divinity School.Since 2004 he has been attending the World Economic Forum in Davos Switzerland every year meeting with global leaders and scholars.He said the World Economic Forum’s theme this year is “The Great Reset.”Kim met with the Korea JoongAng Daily recently at his office in central Seoul.The following are excerpts from the interview with Kim.Q. Can you share your thoughts on the Silver Tower Order of Industrial Service Merit awarded to you recently?A. I am glad that they recognized such efforts especially by the private sector. Our energy industry has long been led by the public sector including state-owned Korea Electric Power Corporation.Although little by little the energy sector is being privatized the overarching energy policy is driven by the government.However in major countries such as Europe and the United States energy is strictly a private sector endeavor.There’s a strong perception [in Korea] that the energy sector should be strictly controlled by the public sector.Preparing for the World Energy Congress [in Daegu in 2013] wasn’t an easy task especially for us a medium-sized private company.Yet the government acknowledging our efforts shows that the private sector could play a central role in the energy sector.Q. What major shifts are we seeing in the energy sector in recent years?A. We are currently at a time where a grand transition is happening in all stages from production to distribution and consumption. We will soon feel that impact. Energy has played a significant role.Innovation in the energy sector has always led to industrial revolutions.The first started with James Watt improving the efficiency of a steam engine while the second industrial revolution kicked off with Nicola Tesla’s alternating current.The first industrial revolution was a grand transition in production. It was solving a problem of how to convert energy into power. The second was a transition on distribution. It was on how far electricity could be sent.Today we’re in a transition where decarbonization is happening in production driven by global warming decentralization in energy distribution and digitalization in consumption.Until now energy has been distributed through a centralized system where a major power plant is built in a remote area.Today however we have solar panels and wind farms that can be set up anywhere including in the middle of a city. There’s no centralized control.This decentralization improves energy by efficiency as energy will no longer be lost as it does not have to travel from a power plant located in a remote area.Consumption-wise energy digitalization is happening. Thanks to internal computer chips every home appliance now has a higher energy efficiency.As such with innovation in the energy sector a major industrial revolution is underway.Q. Is renewable energy the energy innovation that would bring about massive changes?A. Many are talking about renewable energy. However if you take out hydropower and biomass renewable energy only accounts for less than 10 percent of the global energy mix.The reason despite the huge hoopla is because the quality of renewable energy is exceptionally low.The quality is low because the energy production drops to zero when snow covers the solar panels and at night when the sun sets. And wind doesn’t blow every day. The weather makes production unreliable.If renewable energy accounts for 50 percent of the global mix the entire infrastructure could collapse because of its low reliability.The solution to this problem is a major energy storage system.Energy storage systems are everything from the batteries that are used on electronic watches to laptops.We have reached the point of developing a lithium battery for electric vehicles (EV).However global electricity demand is massive.We need an energy storage system that is on a massive scale that could power all industries nationwide.People believe that we are prepared. But that’s a delusion.I haven’t seen a company or a country that has succeeded in such large utility-scale storage.And it is not an easy task. If you look at lithium batteries for EVs alone they even have problems like catching fire.Although everyone agrees that the future is oriented toward renewable energy if we just take a step back there’s a serious problem.Q. What are your thoughts on nuclear energy which is also a clean energy?A. I believe nuclear energy will last for 100 years based on estimated uranium reserves.However 100 years flies by quickly.We have to think about where the energy sector would go after 100 years.Nuclear energy currently is relatively cheap stable and clean. But what do we have afterwards? It’s a serious issue we need to think about.While in our country there’s a hot debate on phasing out nuclear energy I hope the discussion focuses on “post nuclear.”What is there after nuclear energy? We have to set up plans on the post-nuclear era starting now.Even if we want to build additional nuclear plants we don’t have the land to do so. And even those that support nuclear power plants would be against it if it were to be built in their own backyard.What we should talk about is how to maximize our nuclear technology that we currently have.Currently there is a renewed interest in nuclear energy. It is being seen as a nuclear renaissance.Countries that discontinued or were planning to phase out including Britain Taiwan and Japan are again showing interest in nuclear energy.There are about three countries that have capabilities over the entire lifecycle of a nuclear power plant from designing to construction and management.However in the case of Russia many still remember Chernobyl. Additionally the political relationships between Russia and Western countries including those in Europe and the United States are not good.China while aggressive is relatively new.Korea on the other hand has received the highest safety recognition from both the United States and Europe.Technology-wise or even in its political relationship with other countries it is in an advantageous position.It is open season in the nuclear energy market.If the government aggressively markets our strength in nuclear energy we will be able to lead the market much like in smartphones and TV displays.This could help us reshape the global order and possibly be induct into the G7.With the lead in nuclear energy in the global market we should take the opportunity in preparing for the post-nuclear era.Pax Britannica happened because Britain was the center of the first industrial revolution. Pax Americana came about as the United States led the second industrial revolution through energy innovation.Along these lines I believe we could even hope for a Pax Koreana where Korea leads the global economy.Q. Tesla is now growing at an alarming rate including its stock prices. What impact will it have on the global energy market?A. With more people driving EVs there will be a huge demand for energy.Many people think that these energies are generated from renewable energy.But solar wind cannot cover 100 percent of the energy that is being used.The energy that is generated comes from coal-powered plants liquefied natural gas (LNG) plants and nuclear plants.EVs will also be a huge opportunity for Korean companies.The most important component in EVs is the battery which we are leading in.Even a toy car runs on a battery.Q. Covid-19 has affected the world’s energy consumption. What are your thoughts?A. One of my biggest concerns is the eventual surge in demand versus cuts that were made in infrastructure investment [due to Covid-19].World petroleum consumption fell 8 percent last year.The international crude price is currently stable an indication that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has made huge cuts.What really worries me is the cut in investment. Infrastructure investment [in energy] dropped 18 percent [in 2020].A surge in demand on absolute energy is inevitable with economic expansion. But if energy infrastructure fails to meet demands energy prices will spike which could lead to a major crisis.In the past there was a situation where crude prices doubled from $60 to 70 [per barrel] to $135. At the time petroleum supply only fell 1 percent.Q. You seem to have a huge interest in biotechnology as an energy source.A. Yes. I see biotechnology development as the post-nuclear energy solution.Until now we have used dead microorganisms as energy whether it’d be coal or petroleum.But such reserves are limited and we can only depend on these fossil fuels for so long.Instead we should now be focusing on live microbes.Our affiliate Daesung Eco-Energy has been operating a landfill heating gas for an apartment complex in Daegu that provides heat for 15000 households.All we do is cover the waste collected from all around Daegu with dirt and leave it for two to three years. And then we collect methane gas which is used for heating.The anaerobic bacteria floating in the air alive does its jobs on its own in creating methane gas.Not only is this good for pollution but also for the economy.Daesung Eco-Energy is one of our most profitable affiliates.For one it cuts logistical costs.When bringing LNG we first have to acquire the gas in foreign countries such as the United Arab Emirates Qatar Australia or Malaysia. The gas then has to be liquefied before being shipped to a port in Pyeongtaek [in Gyeonggi]. Then the gas is deliquified and distributed to homes via pipes.In the case of the landfill all we need to do is cover the waste with dirt and collect the gas.Even when selling the gas to regional heating corporations for a value below the market price we still make profit.The next step is utilizing microorganisms that generate its own electricity.One example is pouring such microbes into a tank full of water. The power that is produced from the tank is then used in powering home appliances.The ultimate goal of ours is to develop technologies that will raise energy efficiency.Q. You have also focused on environment issues overseas including reforestation in Mongolia.A. I always thought it was obvious [to build hybrid solar and wind power system SolarWin]. The desertification in Mongolia is happening. The wind in [the Gobi Desert of] Mongolia is so strong that a special break has to be installed on the wind generators. And since there are no[dramatic] weather changes mixing solar and wind power connecting it to an energy storage seemed to be a solution.Until recently we’ve been involved in projects that supply power through solar wind and hydro systems in other areas such as Bangladesh Central Asia Ethiopia and the Galápagos Islands.Q. What is your business philosophy?In the bible there is a saying “A good name is more desirable than great riches.”I believe the most profitable business model is working for the public’s good.Business-wise it's energy efficiency. Our entire enterprises will be focusing on efficiencies.Energy efficiency is often referred to as the fifth fuel.However I believe that energy efficiency in fact is the first fuel.BY PARK HYE-MIN LEE HO-JEONG[lee.hojeong@joongang.co.kr]",,,,,,,,,,,,

flyingfishhockey.com

As important as it was to Ed Snider to help youth with the game of hockey it was even more imperative to assist kids in the game of life.

That’s why the late Flyers founder and owner started the Ed Snider Youth Hockey Foundation 15 years ago.

And today nearly five years after his passing (April 11 2016) the Foundation is going stronger than ever.

Snider recognized hockey’s potential in the Philadelphia area after his team won its first Stanley Cup back in 1974. More kids trying to emulate the Bobby Clarkes and Bernie Parents started playing the sport and along with it came a rink construction boom.

Later Snider came to the realization he could help not only grow the sport on a grassroots level but also introduce it to specific demographics like inner-city kids.

From that movement came the decision to help the less fortunate with financial assistance for endeavors such as higher education.

One very special example of this was evident when Virlen Reyes of Kensington spoke at Snider’s memorial service at the Wells Fargo Center.

She acknowledged how the Snider Foundation helped get her into West Chester University and allowed her to graduate with honors.

Currently 48 children like her are involved in the Foundation’s “Goals and Assists’’ program.

According to the organization’s website the Foundation is an “acclaimed non-profit that uses the sport of hockey to educate and empower under-resourced youth of Philadelphia to prosper in the game of life.

“Evidence-based outcomes are young citizens who:

♦ achieve academic success as they matriculate from ‘Crayons through College.’

♦ consistently make healthy and thoughtful life choices.

♦ serve as positive role models to the next generation of Snider Hockey student-athletes.

♦ realize gainful and rewarding employment.

♦ give back to their community.’’

Scott Tharp president and CEO of the Foundation continues to carry on Snider’s vision for equality in opportunity.

He’s been involved with the project since year two and never loses focus on the ultimate goal.

""Things are as good as they’ve ever been because Ed has left us in an enviable position’’ Tharp said during a telephone conversation. “Upon his death he left us a nine-figure endowment which will allow us to continue the programs he wanted us to carry on with for many years to come.’’

Diversity is one of the key elements of the program. Snider stressed inclusiveness at all levels.

“Important to him was growing the sport in a specific manner in which he could reach an audience that otherwise would have considered hockey as non-traditional’’ Tharp said “and otherwise couldn’t afford. Hockey isn’t a cheap sport.

“Ed wanted to make it available to everyone with a particular focus on the boys and girls in the inner city. We kept evolving as a foundation. He saw the importance of doing more than just hockey. Hockey really then became just our hook to gain and hold the attention of our kids so that we could impart much greater life lessons and develop a supplemental education service.’’

The Foundation partners with a number of area universities/colleges including West Chester University of Delaware University of the Sciences Williamson College of the Trades and Kutztown.

“In our Foundation kids can’t just sign up for hockey’’ Tharp said. “They have to sign up to take part in all of our services including supplemental educational services our nationally acclaimed life skills curriculum. And everything we do is at no cost to these kids.

“But I guess there is a cost because Ed always demanded some ‘sweat equity.’ And demanded that kids take part in community service projects as a way to pay for what we’re doing what we’re giving them. In a sense it ingrained a sense of the importance of giving back in our kids.’’

Longtime Snider friend and colleague Ike Richman of Ike Richman Communications points out that the Foundation has a two-times offer for those who make donations. In other words it someone makes a donation of $1000 the Foundation contributes an additional $2000.

Donations can be made through the Foundation’s website: Sniderhockey.org.

Tharp and Snider met through the Arthur Ashe Legacy project. Tharp was president and executive director and Snider was a major contributor.

“He saw the impact we were making on kids there’’ Tharp said. “Just through the sport but again using the sport to keep the kids interested and immersed in education programs.

“I was just so impressed by his commitment that I couldn’t say no (to joining). He was involved in the Foundation from my first day of work. In fact if he didn’t hear from me on a near-daily basis I would hear it from him. He’d say ‘Why haven’t you called me? I want to know what’s going on.’

“He was just that dedicated to this.’’

Find out more about how we test .

Comparison Products

At the 4TB capacity we put the 870 EVO up against a few other high capacity competitors and its smaller 1TB counterpart. From Seagate we’ve added in the FireCuda 120 and IronWolf 110. We also added in WD’s SA500 Samsung’s massive 8TB 870 QVO and like we did in the 1TB pool we’ve included high-end and budget-friendly NVMe SSDs like Samsung’s 970 EVO Plus and Adata’s XPG Gammix S50 Lite.

Game Scene Loading - Final Fantasy XIV

Final Fantasy XIV Shadowbringers is a free real-world game benchmark that easily and accurately compares game load times without the inaccuracy of using a stopwatch.

Samsung’s 87 EVO delivers fast game loading performance. Samsung’s 870 EVO leads the SATA pack with a similar score to its 1TB counterpart and total loading times that are over a second faster than the Seagate FireCuda.

Transfer Rates – DiskBench

We use the DiskBench storage benchmarking tool to test file transfer performance with a custom dataset. We copy a 50GB dataset including 31227 files of various types like pictures PDFs and videos to a new folder and then follow-up with a reading test of a newly-written 6.5GB zip file.

With third place rankings that trail only the NVMe competitors Samsung’s 870 EVO offers solid copy performance and fast large-file read performance for a SATA 6Gbps SSD.

Trace Testing – PCMark 10 Storage Test

PCMark 10 is a trace-based benchmark that uses a wide-ranging set of real-world traces from popular applications and everyday tasks to measure the performance of storage devices.

Samsung’s 870 EVO is remarkably better than its predecessor and left the NAS SSDs in the dust in these tests. While Seagate’s FireCuda 120 led the Samsung 870 EVO in the quick system drive benchmark Samsung’s 870 EVO displayed dominance in the much harder full system drive benchmark posting the lowest latency of the SATA bunch.

Synthetic Testing - ATTO / iometer

iometer is an advanced and highly configurable storage benchmarking tool while ATTO is a simple and free application that SSD vendors commonly use to assign sequential performance specifications to their products. Both of these tools give us insight into how the device handles different file sizes.

Like the 1TB model the 4TB 870 EVO delivers solid sequential performance across the board. 4K random latency was slightly higher at 4TB than 1TB but still that didn't seem to hold the drive back much during the tougher workloads in our previous benchmarks.

Sustained Write Performance and Cache Recovery

Official write specifications are only part of the performance picture. Most SSDs implement a write cache which is a fast area of (usually) pseudo-SLC programmed flash that absorbs incoming data. Sustained write speeds can suffer tremendously once the workload spills outside of the cache and into the ""native"" TLC or QLC flash. We use iometer to hammer the SSD with sequential writes for 15 minutes to measure both the size of the write cache and performance after the cache is saturated. We also monitor cache recovery via multiple idle rounds.

Samsung’s 870 EVO delivers much more consistent write performance than the WD Red SA500 and puts the company’s 870 QVO to shame in sustained write workload performance.

Power Consumption and Temperature

We use the Quarch HD Programmable Power Module to gain a deeper understanding of power characteristics. Idle power consumption is an important aspect to consider especially if you're looking for a laptop upgrade. Some SSDs can consume watts of power at idle while better-suited ones sip just milliwatts. Average workload power consumption and max consumption are two other aspects of power consumption but performance-per-watt is more important. A drive might consume more power during any given workload but accomplishing a task faster allows the drive to drop into an idle state more quickly ultimately saving energy.

We also monitor the drive’s temperature via the S.M.A.R.T. data and an IR thermometer to see when (or if) thermal throttling kicks in and how it impacts performance. Bear in mind that results will vary based on the workload and ambient air temperature.

Image 1 of 5 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

Even though it comes with much more flash Samsung’s 4TB 870 EVO is just as efficient as the 1TB model. With peak power consumption peaking at just 2.58W and low idle power consumption the 870 EVO Plus is an efficient SATA SSD. With such low power consumption there is little concern about encountering thermal throttling.

The incident began around 3 p.m. Sunday on Braddock St and General Bragg Street.

Police were initially called to the scene for a shooting with a hit. After officers arrived they found the suspect had fired a shotgun at his ex-girlfriend’s house.

There were five people inside of his ex-girlfriend’s home at the time shots were fired and one person was hit in the shoulder. Their injury was deemed non-life threatening.

The shooter then fled back to his own residence further down the street from his ex-girlfriend’s home and barricaded himself from police.

Officers said they set up a perimeter outside of his residence and have tried for hours to make contact with him. However the man has not been very cooperative as of yet.

Police said they will stay at the scene for as long as it takes and are still trying to make contact. The man is expected to face four counts of deadly conduct and one count of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon if the standoff ends peacefully.

Further details are limited at this time but we’ll bring more updates as they become available.

The City of Port Alberni will be replacing the lighting at the Alberni Valley Multiplex with more energy-efficient LED lighting.

The topic of lighting in the multiplex first came to Port Alberni city council back in Sept. 2020. Parks recreation and heritage manager Willa Thorpe explained during a Sept. 14 council meeting that lighting in the multiplex’s Coulson Rink has become obsolete as replacement light fixtures are no longer available.

The Coulson Rink has lighting original to the facility while lighting in the next-door Weyerhaeuser Arena was upgraded for the 2009 World Under-17 Hockey Challenge that the city hosted.

“Staff’s recommendation would be to replace both because the only way we can be certain that the technology will be compatible is if we replace both at the same time” said Thorpe.

Although many activities have been halted at the multiplex due to COVID-19 Mayor Sharie Minions said keeping the facility up-to-date is still important.

RELATED: Port Alberni to issue RFP for big screen at AV Multiplex

“We still want to maintain our assets and we still want to make sure that we’re being as carbon efficient as possible” she said on Sept. 14.

An RFP was issued in December and on Jan. 25 the multiplex lighting project was awarded to local contractor Addy Power for a cost of $171892.35.

Of the total cost $100000 will come from the city’s Carbon Trust and the rest will come from the parks and recreation reserve fund.

During the Jan. 25 meeting of council Thorpe said that the city will be receiving a rebate of up to $28000 from BC Hydro for this project. She also expects additional cost-savings for the more energy-efficient lighting.

“Until we actually get the new lights installed it’s difficult to pinpoint exactly what the savings will be” said Thorpe.

“Sometimes the ash was so thick you couldn't see five feet in front of you like being in a snowstorm or dense fog” W. Mae Jones said. Now in her eighties she’s lived there for a half-century.

When the cloud billowed youngsters darted home. Their mothers needed extra hands.

“If you didn’t bring the clothes in off the line you would get little brown and grey spots and have to wash everything again” Ruth Ballard said. The 85-year-old former nurse and lifelong resident recalled that “you would have to re-wash them wash your car out. The odor was terrible.”

Across from Ballard’s modest brick home dry sugarcane stalks rustle in the winter wind their long shadows rippling across a five-acre community garden mostly dormant under the dim sun and overhead power lines.

“They have greens turnips collards mustards kale broccoli tomatoes sweet potatoes Irish potatoes butterbeans” Ballard said.

For 70 years falling ash was an unavoidable part of life in the majority-Black community nestled among the wooded bayous and rivers just three miles north of downtown Mobile Alabama. The problem grew in the 1960s when Scott Paper expanded into one of the world’s largest mills next to IP local shorthand for International Paper.

Ballard said both mills offered free car washes to Africatown residents “anytime day or night.” Vehicles still corroded.

“It not only ate the paint but whatever the car was made out of it ate that too. Whatever the chemicals falling it was that potent” Ballard said.

Limited access to health care heightened the clouds’ more perilous costs.

“I have a sister and two brothers who died as a result of cancer” Ballard said. “Then another brother and myself are twice survivors of cancer.”

The youngest of her brothers was 65. Ruth Ballard has been clear for 14 years now.

“My husband died of cancer three years ago” Jones said.

When Rev. Chris L. Williams Sr. arrived at Africatown’s Yorktown Missionary Baptist Church in 2006 he was stunned.

“I think we had about 20 funerals right in a row that year” from a flock of about 200 the state trooper-turned-pastor recalled. “That's way out of normal.”

After talking to his congregation Williams sent a questionnaire into the community. Cancer was widespread. Williams looked at the heavy industry encircling Africatown: paper mills petroleum tanker farms power cement asphalt and chemical plants. He organized community meetings and called the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

“They told me it’s not a cluster and I told them you got all these people dying from cancer” Williams said. ‘They said it had to be this or that… They know what they’re talking about I guess.”

Williams contacted lawyers anyway. Prospective counsels’ initial enthusiasm faded.

“They would say ‘We know there’s something there’ and take soil samples then go and talk to whomever and come back and say ‘nothing’s there.’ Then they wouldn’t answer the phone anymore” Williams said.

North Alabama firm Stewart and Stewart finally took the case. When filed in 2017 the initial action listed 248 plaintiffs.

As legal motions were volleyed the story’s scope exploded thanks to an unprecedented historic discovery and a merciless unpunished crime that began a centuries-long saga.

Family Business

Africatown was a punctuation mark on centuries of terror.

When Maine native Timothy Meaher entered Mobile in 1835 it was a gateway to the American frontier. He and his brothers made fortunes in river traffic lumber and land.

Meaher wagered he could defy the 50-year-old federal law against importing African slaves. In July 1860 his schooner Clotilda with a belly full of kidnapped African souls slipped past the darkened city docks and toward vast tracts of Meaher-owned Mobile-Tensaw Delta land. In the canebrake and Spanish moss the perpetrators offloaded 110 frightened starving ill captives then steered the Clotilda upriver and set her ablaze.

News of the crime quickly blazed across the region with stories appearing in outlets as far away as Brooklyn. Federal agents arrested Meaher but he insisted he was on another of his ships and offered eyewitnesses. He was also friends with federal prosecutors and the judge. Charges were dropped.

After his release on bond Meaher moved the Africans between properties to elude detection by investigators. Eventually they were sold or divided up among the Meahers. Of them 16 men and 16 women went with Tim Meaher. His brothers took another 28 people.

On Jan. 10 1861 the case against two Meaher accomplices was eventually dismissed while the case against the Clotilda’s captain was continued. Alabama seceded from the Union the next day.

When they were finally emancipated after the Civil War the kidnapped Africans asked Meaher to return them to Africa. He refused. Gradually they bought small parcels from Meaher and built their own community in what was called Plateau. Raised self-determined and free the Africans lacked the deepest psychological shackles of many of the American-born Blacks around them.

“We are one of the few groups in America that know where we came from” Theodore Arthur said. A noted saxophonist Arthur identified himself as president of the original Africatown Direct Descendants of the Clotilda and a fourth-generation descendant of Clotilda captive Pollee Allen.

Arthur said he conferred with Sylviane Diouf for her award-winning and exhaustive 2007 book Dreams of Africa in Alabama. She called Africatown “the first [town] continuously controlled by Blacks the only one run by Africans.”

Those Africans planted the seeds of memory in new soil and grew something familiar. Their independence–they farmed hunted fished established their own business district school and governing structure– rankled many. In 1906 and 1907 lynchings occurred on Plateau/Africatown’s western edge. Those murders said historian David Alsobrook a former director of both the Clinton Presidential Library and the History Museum of Mobile felt like a message to Africatown’s population to “know their place.”

Weeks before the 1929 stock market crash the IP mill opened on land leased from the Meaher family between Africatown and the waterfront. Mobile County Probate deeds show IP finally purchased the land several decades later.

Meantime city sewer water and garbage pick-up were denied Africatown until the mid-‘60s according to a 1967 Southern Courier report. Residents complained that whites would sneak in to dump trash. When the city code required the Meahers to improve numerous shotgun shacks rented to Africatown residents they demolished the ramshackle homes instead.

“People have lived happy and healthy for years without running water and sewers” Tim Meaher’s grandson Augustine Jr. told a Southern Courier reporter. “He don’t need garbage service… He don’t need a bathtub – he’ll probably store food in it. Wouldn’t know how to use it.”

Almost simultaneously Mobile rezoned the area for heavy industry. The Southern Courier reported Scott Paper construction went up where the shacks once stood.

To date the Meahers still hold upwards of 260 acres in and around Africatown. Toxic industries lease much of that land.

In the late 1980s a new bridge was needed for the increasing flow of tractor trailers and tanker trucks barreling through Africatown. When its road was expanded to four lanes it wiped out Africatown’s central business district. That retail was never replaced.

In 2013 public attention turned to a Plains All-American tar sands pipeline carrying the caustic slurry under Africatown’s Mobile County Training School playground. Originally running into storage tanks near the Africatown-Cochrane Bridge over the Mobile River a scheduled flow reversal necessitated removal of the old pipe as a safety measure.

“That was probably the smart thing for Plains to do” President of the Mobile Environmental Justice Action Coalition Ramsey Sprague said. MEJAC was founded in 2013 by frustrated Africatown residents.

“The school system knew about [the pipeline] all along” activist and retired United States Marine Corps Major Joe Womack said. “So did a couple of people in the community but they never had the guts to stand up and tell anybody about it.”

The public fracas resulted in a $75000 donation from Plains All-American. It went toward a new baseball diamond and roof for the school.

Womack is wary of the Meaher family’s gradual acquisition of neighborhood property lots he claims appear derelict. He suspects they want it rezoned from residential to business.

“If my Mama’s house looked like that we’d get fined by the city” Womack said.

Womack cited the area’s population apex as over 10000 in the late 1960s—former pro baseball player and Africatown native Cleon Jones guessed 4000—but said it has winnowed to roughly 1700. The presence of four churches within its one-square-mile confines testify to once greater numbers.

City-data.com gave its median income as $25000 some $14000 less than Mobile’s overall median. Some Africatown homes appear sound. Several others are worn even dilapidated in testimony to the withering forces of Southern life.

Out of Sight Out of Time

In 1989 IP’s Mobile mill released more than 200000 pounds of carcinogenic chloroform normally associated with paper and pulp mills into the air. Three years later Scott Paper released 630000 pounds of chloroform according to the Birmingham News.

Kimberly-Clark absorbed Scott Paper in 1995. Mobile operations continued.

In 1999 Environmental Protection Agency scientists said a dozen dangerous pollutants were found in the air near Africatown with chloroform 100 times higher than safe levels. Among the volatile organic compounds were chloromethane benzene and ethylbenzene hexane naphthalene and toluene.

The federal government began regulating highly toxic dioxins with the 1990 Clean Air Act. In 2000 IP announced the closing of their Mobile mill.

“Ten years is about the time you would expect the largest paper company in the world to explore litigating getting around those types of regulations and in the end deciding they'd rather close shop than conform” Sprague said.

“IP bulldozed everything the whole plant left everything in the ground” Womack said. Most of the massive tract is vacant now covered in tall grasses and scrubby trees. Cracked concrete stumps jut from the former foundation. A pipe company occupies the easternmost portion.

Womack and others claim proper remediation of dioxins and furans was avoided. Sprague went to the Alabama Department of Environmental Management’s (ADEM) offices in Montgomery the state capital to find the exit plan IP is required to file.

“I met with [ADEM Director] Lance LeFleur and asked about IP’s plan. He said ‘It’s here’ and looked but couldn’t find it” Sprague said. “He called his solid waste guy in to look also and they couldn’t find it in any of their electronic or physical files.”

LeFleur said he couldn’t recall a one-on-one meeting with Sprague though records indicated Sprague attended a pair of group meetings. ADEM’s online e-file system showed no specific remediation plans for the IP site.

“There are only certain circumstances where hazardous waste was either in the ground water or in the soil where a formal remediation plan is required” LeFleur said. That determination is made by regular ADEM inspection.

Previous EPA citations didn’t surprise LeFleur. He pointed to the difference in levels of pollutants.

“You know I live in an older home and they used to burn coal for heating and put ashes out in the backyard so there’s coal ash in my backyard but it doesn’t rise to the level of hazardous waste” LeFleur said.

Mobile’s Baheth Research and Development Laboratories began sample collection around Africatown during Phase I third-party evaluations including topographical and historical studies for PCB generators and effects on water soil and wildlife.

“That’s what made a case for $1.8 billion” Baheth’s Raoul Richardson said.

IP’s revenue was $21.743 billion in 2017 and $22.4 billion in 2019. Early that year a local reporter’s discovery of the Clotilda wreckage upriver from Africatown was announced. Covered in silt and muddy water for 160 years it arose and rejuvenated the 110 captives’ tale.

The emergence of “the last slave ship” rang globally. National Geographic visited as did network news reporters and Benin Ambassador Hector Posset.

Around the same time Zora Neale Hurston’s book Barracoon: The Story of the Last ""Black Cargo"" was finally published 90 years after she had finished it. The work is based on her 1927 visits with Cudjo Lewis the last surviving Africatown founder.

Museum ideas materialized. Dreams of historic renewal bloomed. Womack and others pushed for a “blueway” a recreational trail utilizing area waterways.

Meanwhile additional plaintiffs in the IP lawsuit swelled past 1000. Local asphalt maker H.O. Weaver and Sons were added as defendants and the case was remanded from federal court to Mobile circuit court in May 2017.

Richardson said Baheth Labs sent their report to Stewart and Stewart and a summary to MEJAC. Then he heard the law firm had contracted another lab for an additional report.

As COVID-19 spread plaintiffs received news of a tentative settlement. A letter from Stewart and Stewart dated May 29 2020 told one plaintiff: “When we began working on this case we believed that we wound [sic] find significant amounts of pollution in the community. However this did not prove to be the case. First the soil testing we performed showed that the dioxin and furan pollution was merely at background levels meaning the amounts were no different on the Africatown property than from anywhere else.”

The letter encouraged the plaintiff to agree to the “satisfactory settlement.” Though they varied the highest figure mentioned among plaintiffs was $8000. Rev. Williams said he knew of others who received as little as $200.

The settlement terms required 95 percent of plaintiffs to agree and sign releases prohibiting future action. Without that minimal percentage the letter said no one would receive settlement funds.

There were no specifics on attorney fees in the letter. According to plaintiffs the firm initially said their fees would be up to 40 percent of the final settlement.

Amidst the pandemic’s economic downturn 1090 plaintiffs signed off. A joint dismissal of complaint was filed Nov. 2 2020.

“As we have stated since this case was filed we categorically deny the allegations made by the plaintiffs. Nevertheless we determined it to be in IP’s best interest to resolve their claims. The terms of this resolution are confidential and may not be disclosed by the parties” Tom Ryan of IP said in a Jan. 11 2021 statement.

“We found tremendous amounts of contaminants that we know are known carcinogens that would definitely adversely impact their health and safety” Richardson said.

Baheth Labs’ paperwork mentioned “persistent organic pollution” or POP levels of 3000 micrograms per kilogram in soil and water samples. That included eight dioxins furans and PCBs in its congener group.

“The EPA and World Health Organization have determined that concentrations greater than 0.00003 are known carcinogens” the report read.

Lab founder M. Allam Baaheth said their work was verified by a second lab.

In a 2016 report The World Health Organization described dioxins as tied to elevated cancer rates. Its decay rate was defined as long-lasting estimated between seven to 11 years. Chlorine bleaching of paper pulp was listed as a major source.

Once in the air the toxins eventually permeate water soil and more. Although lipophilic and drawn to fatty tissue those poisons could affect a community garden too.

“If you eat the vegetables if the last time you ate it was in 2000 and 2005 that stuff would still be in your body. In fish from the waterways there would be more in chickens more in pork even more” Richardson said.

POP effects are cumulative. Their long-term concentration in humans is found through blood and human milk samples not soil.

Despite numerous inquiries plaintiff attorneys Stewart & Stewart declined comment on this story.

The family which declined comment for this story has traditionally remained quiet about the Clotilda saga. In 2018 Augustine Meaher III told a West Coast reporter his great grandfather Tim wasn’t responsible. He blamed Clotilda Capt. William Foster.

In literature on the Mobile River’s “chemical corridor” of 25 manufacturers the Mobile Chamber of Commerce ballyhooed ADEM’s “fast-track permitting” and ability to work with businesses.

In early 2020 details for the Africatown Heritage House were unveiled. The museum—planned adjacent to the schoolyard with a pipeline less than a quarter mile from the old IP location—will usher visitors through historic Mobile West Africa the Middle Passage and feature artifacts from the Clotilda. Boat and land tours are sought as well.

Mobile Mayor Sandy Stimpson and other political leaders think Africatown can generate tourist dollars like Montgomery’s National Lynching Memorial. Stimpson has his own generational imprint there. His family’s lumberyard and wood treatment facility sprawls across 30 acres of what was once Africatown’s Lewis Quarters neighborhood. They sold the entire outfit in 2013 for more than $80 million.

Five top acts including Ed Sheeran Queen and Adele have contributed more than £50 million to the public finances in a year according to The Sunday Times Tax List.

Sheeran who turns 30 in a couple of weeks is the largest taxpayer of the musicians on the list with a total tax bill put at £28.2m. About £7m of corporation tax was paid in 2019 by the company that handles the Grammy-winning singer’s music sales. It also paid him a £10m dividend liable for £3.8m of tax.

But £17.4m of his tax bill was accounted for by earnings from his hugely successful world tour between 2017 and 2019.

It was about this time last year that we started hearing daily reports about COVID-19 and 60 days later we were all locked down. Of course a much more enjoyable topic is Las Vegas Luxury Hotels.

Las Vegas Luxury Hotels

Now the world is opening up and with Valentine’s Day around the corner (and on President’s Day weekend!) you have the opportunity to make your first trip back a luxurious and romantic one while taking advantage of great prices. Even better LVA Travel has some bonuses that will make your trip that much better. These rates include a ton of amenities including:

Daily breakfast for two

A property-specific amenity such as an F&B credit for $100. The hotel may substitute property credits for COVID-affected areas such as spas.

An upgrade at check-in if available

Early check-in or late check-out if available

Here are our eight favorite options. Whether you choose just a night or making it a 3-day weekend you’ll be well taken care of. All rates were good as of the time I wrote this and cancellable (although a few require deposits). Unless otherwise noted our prices include taxes and fees.

1. Aria – Las Vegas Luxury Hotels

Barely ten years old Aria has beautiful rooms and an outstanding center-strip location. The $179 room rate (~$235 after taxes and fees) is the same as what you’d get if you book directly but we include the two daily breakfast credits ($30 each) as well as a $100 food and beverage credit per stay. That’s Valentine’s Day in one of the best Las Vegas Luxury Hotels for under $100!

High roller: Stay the whole weekend checking in February 12 and out February 15 for $915 before your $100 F&B credit and $180 worth of breakfasts.

2. Bellagio Resort And Casino

I’m a sucker for the classics and Bellagio will always be one of my favorites. Whether it’s the fountains the conservatory or the restaurants I still think of Bellagio as the pinnacle of Las Vegas Luxury. Now you can do it for less.

Including taxes fees and other nasty stuff the night of February 14 will cost you a measly $247. But that also comes with two $30 breakfast credits and a $100 F&B credit knocking your bill down to a paltry net of $87.

High roller: Stay the weekend for $968 and pick up $180 worth of breakfast and your $100 F&B credit. In case you’re curious the standard rate (without any amenities) is $965 so your $280 in amenities are costing you $3. Hmm…

3. Four Seasons Hotel Las Vegas

When people think of luxury hotel brands Four Seasons is usually one of the first to come to mind. The property in Las Vegas actually sits on floors 35-39 of Mandalay Bay so you get a bit of the Strip and a bit of a respite at the same time.

At $334 for the evening of February 14 this is one of the cheapest Four Seasons properties that you will find in the country a benefit of being in Las Vegas. It comes with a $100 property credit (good throughout the property) as well as breakfast for two.

High roller: $997 to stay February 12 — February 15 which is actually a “third-night free” rate. Hey it’s the Four Seasons.

4. Wynn Las Vegas And Encore

Wynn and Encore are as good as it gets with all of the hospitality that one would expect to find at a Steve Wynn property. It’s also one of the better deals on our lists particularly in a 745-square foot room at Encore which is the same price as Wynn.

$272 which includes taxes and fees gets you not only one of the luxury suites but also two breakfasts and $100 in hotel credits although the mix may be affected by COVID since it typically includes a $50 spa credit. That’s a net of $112.

High roller: $852 for the three nights which like Four Seasons is actually a “third-night free” offer. Between the two I’d take this one over the Four Seasons in a heartbeat.

5. Waldorf Astoria Las Vegas

W-A is one of the few offers that comes with loyalty points. In this case you’ll receive Hilton Honors points in addition to all of your other benefits.

Valentine’s night will set you back only $265 and comes with a $125 spa credit (subject to substitution) as well as breakfast for two. There’s no casino at the property which for many of us is a good thing.

High roller: Three nights come with the $125 credit and breakfast everyday clocks in at $875 which means the net cost of your long weekend in Las Vegas will be less than $600.

6. Delano Las Vegas

Best known for its Delano Beach Club the Delano Las Vegas is a boutique all-suite property next to Mandalay Bay.

Not only is the Delano one of the nicest properties on our list but it is also one of the least expensive. The room (including taxes and fees) costs $217 for the night but comes with a $100 F&B credit as well as breakfast for two. In other words a total of just over $50 after subtracting your amenities.

High roller: Need the full three-night treatment? It’s only $736 before your F&B credit and daily breakfast.

7. The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas

Cosmo comes with a center-strip location cool vibe and for some of us the most important part: Marriott Bonvoy Rewards points.

The hotel is one of the more expensive properties on our list with the evening of February 14 costing $403. It includes the typical breakfast for two and $100 F&B credit.

8. The Palazzo at the Venetian

Palazzo is another personal favorite. It’s an all-suite hotel at the Venetian with rooms that are 700+ square feet and contain a sunken living room. It makes a perfect Valentine’s Day escape.

The room is not outrageously expensive with February 14 costing $333 for the night. That comes with a $100 F&B credit and $65 breakfast credit so about half of your total cost is covered.

The long weekend is a little pricier. I’ve seen rates without the amenities in the $900-950 range and the weekend with the amenities currently runs at $1385. This is one of the highest-end properties on the list.",,,,,,,,,
XEL,Xcel Energy,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL2NvbG9yYWRvL25ld3MvYXZhbGFuY2hlLXNhYWQtd2lsZC13aW4v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Avs & Saad Top Minnesota Wild 5-1 - CBS Colorado,"ST. PAUL Minn. (AP) — Brandon Saad had a goal and assist to lead a balanced scoring attack and the Colorado Avalanche beat the Minnesota Wild 5-1 on Saturday night.

Logan O'Connor Joonas Donskoi Mikko Rantanen and J.T. Compher also scored for Colorado which has won three straight and four of five to take the West Division lead. Ten players had points including two assists each for Samuel Girard Andre Burakovsky and Nathan MacKinnon.

Philipp Grubauer made 19 saves for his NHL-best sixth win.

""It just seems like we're getting opportunities guys are finding the back of the net a little bit of confidence comes back"" coach Jared Bednar said. ""I think we're getting better production and better games out of our second third and fourth line.""

Matt Dumba scored and Kaapo Kahkonen stopped 28 shots for Minnesota.

""They're the class of the league"" Minnesota's Zach Parise said. ""They play a good style of hockey — they're fast. The top line is arguably one of the best in the league so it was a different type of game than we had played in the first eight.""

In the first of four straight games between the teams Saad scored on a one-timer in the third period for a 4-1 lead his third straight multipoint game and Compher later added his first of the year.

Traded by Chicago to Colorado on Oct. 10 Saad had one goal and no assists in his first six games.

""It's a short training camp to get into a quick season new systems new team so you try to mesh and jell as quickly as you can"" he said. ""The points are nice and they make you feel good but it's really game by game.""

Rantanen gave Colorado a 3-1 lead early in the second period with his seventh of the season weaving around two defenders cutting across the slot and scoring from the left dot. He is the first player in Avalanche/Nordiques history to score in the team's first five road games.

Rantanen who entered tied with four others for the league lead in goals has scored in seven of the past eight outings.

The teams traded fluky goals early.

In his first shift of the season O'Connor's long shot deflected off Kahkonen's stick laying in the crease at 3:02. Dumba answered less than 4 minutes later with a rising wrist shot that went off the mask of Grubauer.

""It definitely doesn't happen often but it was nice after some extended time off to have a good O-zone shift there to start and get that goal there"" O'Connor said.

Donskoi scored on the power-play with 15.7 seconds left in the frame.

Colorado was 2 of 7 on the power play and is clicking at 31.1% this season. Its penalty kill was 2 for 2 and has killed off 19 straight shorthanded situations. The Wild are 2 for 36 on the power play this season.

NO FIALA

Wild LW Kevin Fiala served the first game of his three-game suspension for a boarding penalty and game misconduct in Thursday's win over Los Angeles. Fiala scored three goals in his past four games.

Minnesota dressed 11 forwards. Brad Hunt slotted into the lineup as a seventh defenseman.

IN AND OUT

Colorado D Erik Johnson left in the first period after getting crushed into the boards by Jordan Greenway. Wild C Marcus Johansson and Dumba left with apparent injuries. Neither coach had an update. ... Avalanche C Pierre-Edouard Bellemare and D Devon Toews missed their first games with lower-body injuries. Bednar had no timetable for either's return. O'Connor replaced Bellemare on the fourth line. D Conor Timmins took Toews' spot. … Wild G Cam Talbot backed up Kahkonen after missing the past three games with a lower-body injury.

A HEAP OF HELPERS

Colorado D Cale Makar recorded his 10th assist in his ninth game. Only John-Michael Liles reached the marker quicker in franchise history needing eight games in 2010-11.

HONORING THE PAST

The Wild plans to wear their retro sweaters featuring Minnesota North Stars colors for the first time Sunday.

""For all of us North Star fans here in Minnesota you feel like it's been a long time coming that we add a little bit of that into the jerseys and into the team"" said Parise whose father J.P. played nine seasons for the state's former NHL team.

UP NEXT

The teams close out a two-game series in Minnesota on Sunday before playing two in Denver.

LINCOLNSHIRE Ill. — Zebra Technologies Corporation a manufacturer of marking tracking and computer printing technologies announces the release of its EC5x series consisting of individually assigned mobile computers designed to help employees collaborate while improving individual productivity.

The company’s thinnest and lightest mobile computer the EC5x series is said to feature the look and feel of a consumer smartphone with an Android™ 10 operating system optional integrated scanner and a robust software suite designed for frontline workers.

The EC5x is designed to be a company-owned personally assigned device that is carried at all times keeping workers connected and improving responsiveness to real-time changing conditions. It can be used in the retail hospitality government and ancillary healthcare markets to optimize a wide variety of applications including patient transport staff collaboration and housekeeping.

The EC5x series can fit in a pocket or be used as a wearable accessory is RFID-ready and has an optional snap-on trigger handle to provide added comfort for scan-intensive tasks. It features a five-inch HD screen and can scan nearly any barcode in any condition due to it being virtually waterproof drop-proof and dust-proof. Its 13-megapixel color rear camera can also capture highly detailed photos to document proof of delivery or compliance.

“Zebra’s new EC5x series expands the industry’s broadest portfolio of Android-based enterprise-class mobile computers with our first individually assigned smartphone-like device designed to help businesses significantly improve productivity and collaboration while delivering unmatched total benefits of ownership” said Joe White Senior Vice President and General Manager for Enterprise Mobile Computing Zebra Technologies. “Multi-year deployment and support eliminates the cost and complexities of managing different models. With a long lifecycle innovative productivity tools and security support for the Android OS the EC5x series’ total cost of ownership (TCO) is approximately half of a consumer smartphone without sacrificing any of the familiarity or design features that front-line workers now expect.”
