The annual Saragarhi Day commemorates the men who died defending a modern-day Pakistan on 12 September 1897.

Saragarhi was a small outpost on the border between British India and Afghanistan in the north-west frontier.

When 21 men of the 36th Sikhs found themselves surrounded by 10000 hostile Afghan fighters they had a choice: surrender or fight to the last round of ammunition.

They chose the latter and all 21 men died.

Jones has yet to feature this season having been ruled out of the opening game at Norwich City through concussion protocols while not even making the bench against Chelsea last time out.

The 20-year-old also suffered frustration when the postponement of England under-21's game against Romania meant he had to serve a one-match ban against Kosovo instead and failed to play during the international break.

Jones is likely to finally be given minutes over the next few weeks as Liverpool begin a busy spell of seven games in 22 days with Sunday's Premier League trip to Leeds United.

And former Liverpool winger Steve McManaman believes a shift in position could help the Academy graduate follow the path of Trent Alexander-Arnold.

""Curtis needs to kick on again just like every player"" said McManaman who now works for BT Sport.

""Trent hasn't stopped - his trajectory has just kept on going from a 16 17-year-old who was playing U18 and U23 level and then up to the first team.

""Curtis has been exactly the same. U18s he was a superstar. U23s he was leading goalscorer and the best player and had to move up to the first team as he was too good for the U23s.

""He just needs to keep on doing that keep on improving and keep on adding to his game.

""Maybe he needs to play a little bit further forward and I'd prefer to see that. He takes people on really easily and I want to see more of that.

""But he has to keep on improving because he's playing with Mo Salah and Sadio Mane and Jordan Henderson and Fabinho and Thiago players of that standard. But is he good enough? Absolutely.""

McManaman is a regular visitor to Liverpool's Academy in Kirkby and has seen much of the U18 and U23 teams in recent seasons.

And the ex-Red has been particularly impressed with the 16-year-old Kaide Gordon following his £3million move from Derby County in February.

""I spoke to Kaide after the Chelsea game"" said McManaman. ""He has had a really good summer and has really impressed the manager.

""Because of the Euros and Copa America there were a lot of kids in Jurgen's group in pre-season and I know he was impressed by a lot of them.

""Kaide is a really good kid excellent footballer and a real talent.

""He is doing everything right and because he's only a young kid you want to keep him under the radar.

""But he's not the only one. Layton Stewart was doing well before his ACL injury the team got to the Youth Cup final and lost to a decent Aston Villa side who had 5000 of their own fans in and Liverpool were missing some players.

""The Academy is really strong at the moment. It has nurtured a lot of talent and you just hope that the likes of Layton and Tom Hill who has also had an ACL injury get back to where they were earlier as they were on a really good path.

""The fact the U18s and U23s have started the season well shows the Academy are doing an incredible job.""

Scores of shoppers descended on Home Bargains' newest store today after months of waiting for the grand launch.

The doors were opened to the £3 million Festival Park branch at 8am this morning as some shoppers lined up outside while others waited in their cars.

And those looking to snap up a few bargains - including the much sought-after Halloween pumpkin jars - have been impressed with the sprawling new store along with its bakery.

More Festival Park news

Manager Neil Birks who has worked for Home Bargains for 15 years said: ""It has been a long time coming but we are now finally open.

""I am glad we have it open and have had people through the doors.

""We have no special offers on. Our prices are always low and the low prices are here to stay.

""We have a bakery and we have all had training for it.""

The 32-year-old added: ""The staff are helpful. We want to send everybody out with a smile on their face. Customer service is number one for us. We want to make sure everybody has a good experience when they come and that they get what they want and more.""

The 15920 sq ft store is stocked with homeware health and beauty products and fresh and frozen food. There is even a bakery providing fresh bread pastries and cakes - which will all be baked in-store daily.

A total of 58 people are employed at the store - with 51 of those new recruits.

Stoke-on-Trent Central MP Jo Gideon was among those paying a visit this morning. She said: ""It's great to see Home Bargains come to Festival Park creating over 50 new jobs for local people.

""I had a walk round this morning and it was great to see how popular it is. I wish them all the best.""

Plenty of shoppers had turned out to land a Halloween pumpkin jar. Among those was Audrey Gardiner of Congleton who was first in the queue. The 43-year-old said: ""I am here because it is a new opening and there is a Halloween jar which everybody is trying to get. I have been to 10 stores and can't get them but this store has them.""

Chloe Heath of Wolstanton had also headed along to get a pumpkin jar. The 36-year-old said: ""It is really good. I came for the pumpkin jars and managed to get two. I know there are lots of Home Bargains but it is nice to have one here. It is nice and open and there are parent and child parking areas. I can't fault it. It's really good.""

Shopper Natalie Potter aged 32 of Abbey Hulton said: ""We were up at 6am and got here early and waited in the car park.

""I have watched this Home Bargains being built brick by brick.

""I am here for the Christmas stuff.""

Sue Robinson aged 50 of Norton was impressed by the fresh products. She said: ""The bakery is good. It has some nice fresh bread. I have just been to Morrisons and thought I would just pop in. Our closest Home Bargains is in Tunstall. This is a lot easier.""

David said: ""It is really good. We were impressed with the store.""

Steve said: ""We always went to the one in Burslem. We have always found them cheap.

""There is a lot more choice here than Burslem. We will be doing our weekly shopping here. The staff are lovely. It is nice to see more people on the tills. We hope it stays that way.""

The site had previously played host to PC World and Furniture Outlet. Permission to transform it into a Home Bargains was given by Stoke-on-Trent City Council in October 2019.

The store is open from 8am to 8pm Monday to Saturday and 10am to 4pm on Sunday.

""Today marks twenty years since that Tuesday morning when the United States came face-to-face with tragedy and destruction in the wake of terrorist attacks in New York City Washington D.C. and Pennsylvania.

Enter raffle for a change to win a 2019 KTM 150SX

Road2Recovery is assisting Destry Abbott with a raffle to raise funds for Charlotte Destry’s wife who has cancer. The motorcycle up for grabs is a fully loaded 2019 KTM 150SX. Here is the letter from Destry Abbott and more about his family’s circumstance:

Hi Everyone

I wanted to give you an update regarding how my wife Charlotte is doing and also ask for a favor. As most of you know Charlotte’s breast cancer has returned and this time has spread to her bones. In addition she broke her back due to brittle bones not long after her diagnoses. It’s now been 5-months since her accident and a little less than that since starting her chemo treatments. She’s currently doing a lot better with her back and has relearned to walk and can now take care of herself which is awesome! She finished her main chemo treatment but the cancer hasn’t fully disappeared so they’re keeping her on a three week maintenance cycle to see if that helps. Unfortunately she wasn’t able to complete her last treatment due to results from her last echocardiogram so now she’s having to see a cardiologist to make sure her heart is able to handle the treatment before we move forward.

The good news is we have her scheduled to go to MD Anderson in Houston Texas at the end of October for a second opinion and she’s staying positive and working towards rebuilding her strength. This is where I went for my treatments and we feel it’s the best place to go in the world! They have a lot of trials and advanced medicine that can possibly help her out. Of course we’ve also had an amazing support system and we are so overwhelmed and thankful to everyone that has stepped up in so many ways to help. Our kids and family have gone above and beyond to help take care of her during this time. We’ve had amazing close friends such as Cody Miller (from CM Offroad) who surprised us by donating and building up a KTM 150 from the ground up with help from the sponsors listed below specifically for the purpose of raffling it off to help raise funds for the battle we have in front of us. Road2Recovery is taking care of the logistics for the raffle and helping make a push to the community for us.

Many of you are aware of the non-profit DA8 Strong Foundation (501c3) that we started after Charlotte and I recovered from our treatments back in 2017 focused on helping cancer patients. This is a passionate cause for us obviously and we really put a lot of work into helping cancer patients with this foundation. Ironically the only cancer patients we can’t help with this foundation is ourselves since we are the founders and on the board of the foundation.

So our ask of you is if you would be able to share the info regarding this raffle to help raise money for bills and traveling expenses that would mean so much to our family! We’re not the type of people to ask for anything but we have some tough times ahead and could really use the help.

The bike will also be on display at the final AMA National Motocross in Hangtown this weekend at the Road2Recovery tent. Huge thank you to them for stepping up and taking care of all of this for us! <3",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tb250Z29tZXJ5LWhlcmFsZC5jb20vc3BvcnRzL21peGVkLW1hcnRpYWwtYXJ0cy1jZW50ZXItdXAtYW5kLXJ1bm5pbmcvYXJ0aWNsZV81NzYxMWUxYS0xMzA5LTExZWMtOTJjYy01MzI1OTFjMDg3YTYuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mixed martial arts center up and running | Sports,"Oak Hill WV (25901)

A new Australian digital vaccine passport is officially in the works with the Australian government announcing it has selected Accenture to build the technology.

The digital vaccine passport called the Digital Passenger Declaration (DPD) will replace physical incoming passenger cards and the COVID-19 Australian Travel Declaration web forms the government said.

Functionally it will link with the QR code vaccination certificate that is set to be introduced later this month and capture essential information up to 72 hours prior to a person boarding a plane.

Australians currently use either a digital or paper certificate to indicate their COVID-19 vaccination status which can be retrieved through the Express Plus Medicare mobile app or a myGov account. These certificates are filled with various issues however with users easily able to forge their records.

""The DPD will support the safe re-opening of Australia's international borders by providing digitally-verified COVID-19 vaccination details"" Minister of Home Affairs Karen Andrews said.

""This will help us to welcome home increasing numbers of Australians and welcome the tourists travellers international students skilled workers and overseas friends and family we've all been missing during the pandemic.""

Accenture was selected to build the DPD following a competitive tender process that was run by Home Affairs.

The company will work alongside Home Affairs to deliver the initial operating capability of the DPD later in the year.

The DPD will first undergo testing before it is deployed at major Australian airports.

In terms of when the DPD will be rolled out the federal government has not given a definite timeline.

Once the DPD is rolled out the government will also consider other use cases for the technology that the DPD is based on said Stuart Robert the Minister responsible for data and digital policy.

The digitisation program could potentially be used for visas import permits personnel identity cards licenses registrations and other documents he said.

The announcement of the new digital system follows the federal government last year shelving its plan to privatise Australia's visa processing system terminating the contentious request-for-tender process for its proposed Global Digital Platform.

At the same time government-owned Healthdirect Australia has launched a new portal for finding and booking vaccination appointments.

Both federal and state governments already have their own respective booking portals but these portals do not display appointments for vaccine clinics that are listed as ""phone only"" bookings.

The new vaccine clinic finder is meant to show vaccine appointments across every clinic registered with the National COVID-19 Vaccine Taskforce Healthdirect Australia CEO Bettina McMachon said.

""This system is the only one which shows vaccine appointments across every clinic registered with the National COVID-19 Vaccine Taskforce -- whether they be general practice pharmacy or State/Territory vaccination centres. Offered in multiple languages it provides the most choice for consumers to find a time and place that suits them to get a vaccine"" she said.

If you think that is or will be true for you here is an incredible tip for one of the key functions in Adobe Premiere Pro.

Whenever somebody tells me a tip is going to blow my mind I am usually left thoroughly unmoved. This video however is not an example of that. I have been using Adobe Premiere Pro and Sony Vegas for many years at this point and zooming in and out of videos is irritating. I have to find the right keyframe to start the transition either manually navigate the zoom over several keyframes or allow it to move itself between two and it's all time-consuming. It is one of those jobs like making complex selections in Photoshop: it's dull and longwinded but there aren't any great workarounds out there.

In this video PiXimperfect tries out an extension for Premiere Pro called Drag Zoom Pro and it allows you to make smooth transitions in the easiest quickest and the most intuitive way I have seen yet. I'm not sure if this video by PiXimperfect is sponsored by the creator of Drag Zoom Pro and frankly I don't care if it is! If you use Adobe Premiere Pro for anything — videography creating photography tutorials behind-the-scenes footage whatever it may be — this plugin looks to be an incredible quality of life improvement.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vdGVjaC9pbmZvcm1hdGlvbi10ZWNoL3doby1pcy1wcmF0aXZhLW1vaGFwYXRyYS10aGUtbmV3LWNoaWVmLW9mLWFkb2JlLWluZGlhL2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzg2MTE0MzEzLmNtc9IBhAFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vdGVjaC9pbmZvcm1hdGlvbi10ZWNoL3doby1pcy1wcmF0aXZhLW1vaGFwYXRyYS10aGUtbmV3LWNoaWVmLW9mLWFkb2JlLWluZGlhL2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy84NjExNDMxMy5jbXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Who is Prativa Mohapatra the new chief of Adobe India?,"Elevate Your Tech Prowess with High-Value Skill Courses Offering College Course Website Indian School of Business ISB Product Management Visit Indian School of Business Professional Certificate in Product Management Visit MIT MIT Technology Leadership and Innovation Visit

In the early days of San Juan Bautista the stage carrying well-to-do travelers would have stopped in front of either the National Hotel which stood on the site of Verutti Park on Second Street or the Plaza Hotel which still stands as the centerpiece of the San Juan Bautista State Historic Park.

It is the third restoration since the park was created in 1968 and follows a three-year project that ended in 1981.

“That was a major retrofitting along with a restoration” said the park’s lead interpreter Marcos Vizcaino. “They made new adobe bricks for the walls; they replastered repainted and then they redecorated.”

The current restoration which started in July and is scheduled to finish in November is less extensive.

“The exterior restoration on the Plaza Hotel includes fixing any of the damaged facade and the adobe framing fixing any of the windows and doors and then giving it a full paint job” said Rich Winklebleck park maintenance chief for the Gavilan Hills sector.

The restoration is complicated by the different construction methods used over the years as new owners adapted it to different uses.

“The building was built in two major stages” Vizcaino said. “The first floor was built out of adobe in 1813 as a barracks for the Spanish soldiers and it took about a year to complete with whitewashed walls dirt floors and a red tile roof. Six soldiers were stationed there. When Mexico took over the area the barracks were used for their soldiers.

In the 1830s another barrack was built and this building became a private residence for the Anzar family.

In 1853 Angelo Zanetta bought it and remodeled it into a destination hotel. The tile roof was removed and the second story of wood construction was placed on top of the existing adobe walls.

“He had noticed that thousands of people came to town during the yearly San Juan Fiesta on the feast day of John the Baptist” Vizcaino said. “He knew they needed a place to stay and he also wanted to have a makeshift saloon to sell liquor during the week-long celebration—and he made a lot of money doing that.”

Zanetta chose to open on the feast day June 24 1856. The hotel included a five-star restaurant. The bar was often patronized by the local Californios who remained on horseback inside while drinking or playing pool.

“There would be an alert when the stage was approaching the hotel” Vizcaino said “and it was the job of Zanetta’s young daughter to roust all of the horsemen out of the bar before new visitors arrived.”

According to Vizcaino upon arriving women and children were not allowed to stay on the ground floor and were escorted upstairs to a common drawing room. Men were taken to the bar to check in and drink or play cards. There was a special two-story outhouse built with the higher level accessed by a covered catwalk.

The roof on that outhouse and the adjoining icehouse are targets for repair as is the entire side of the building facing Mariposa Street which is currently covered in scaffolding. There are repairs required to other parts of the building to replace damaged wood eroded adobe and leaking roofs.

“There is nothing that is structurally endangered” Winklebleck said. “It is more to preserve the historical fabric of the building itself. There are some issues with the condition and some past repairs have dilapidated because they were done incorrectly. There is also water intrusion and weather damage.”

With a well-documented architectural history and the records of previous restorations available the work is thoroughly based on accuracy.

“We have plans for what the finished woodworking looked like so we have a good reference to that” Winklebleck said. “The most difficult things are matching colors and getting the adobe right. We have paint analysis on the earliest layer on a piece of the original molding. But things like the adobe require using accurate materials and methods to be historically sound.”

While other buildings in the park are in need of similar repair Winklebleck thinks the Plaza Hotel is a good place to start the work.

“This is where everything in the park is centered and where it all began” he said. “If we let this building dilapidate we lose the heart of the park. It is something people recognize from their childhood from coming to the park on their mission field trips. It is an important part of our history and it is critical we preserve it.”

Isn’t it just a victimless crime?

Money-laundering is far from a victimless crime claims Gary Murray an anti-money laundering expert at Chartered Bank. “When there’s money-laundering going on invariably there are individuals who’ve suffered.”

Criminal activity always has a victim

What exactly is money-laundering? Basically it turns money that was obtained from criminal activity such as drug-dealing or sex-trafficking into money that appears to come from a legitimate source. Engaging in this activity is a crime.

As for why money-laundering is always predicated on someone’s suffering Murray explains that by definition criminal activity involves a victim. In the case of money-laundering some examples include:

People whose lives are destroyed by the illegal drugs that drug traffickers push.

The dead and wounded that result from the activities of illegal arms dealers.

The people condemned to live in slavery because of human traffickers.

For Murray a particularly noxious side of money-laundering is that “cleaning” dirty money helps enable human trafficking. Money-laundering is a central component of human trafficking.

Traffickers need to launder their money

If it weren’t for money-laundering human trafficking would not be the $150 billion a year industry it is today. “Criminals engage in human trafficking because it’s profitable” states Murray.

However he continues “traffickers can only benefit from the money they’ve made if they can make it appear that the money was obtained legally and they can have it enter the legitimate financial system.”

In other words they need to launder the money they obtained when they were enslaving another person and make it appear that the money was obtained legitimately.

Why can’t they just spend the cash?

Spending large amounts of cash is harder than it might seem. For a start large amounts of cash are a logistical nightmare.

As Murray says “Suppose you’re a trafficker and you have a million dollars in cash. Right there you have a problem. If you have it in one-dollar bills those bills will weigh 2200 pounds.” Even if you have the cash in $100 bills ""you’re still up against lugging around 22 pounds of cash.”

Spending that much cash isn’t just problematic. Because of current anti-money laundering laws it’s close to impossible.

Suppose Mr. Trafficker wants to use his cash to buy the $100000 car he’s been wanting. If he puts down more than $10000 in cash the car dealer—or any other businessperson—is required to file an IRS Form 8300.

The form is entered into an IRS database and it’s electronically flagged. IRS and other law enforcement agencies are now interested in Mr. Trafficker.

He needs to avoid this.

Source: Stock Adobe

So how does he launder his dirty money so he can spend it without coming to the attention of law enforcement? How does he get to the point where he can spend the money on a car boat mansion or anything else?

Ways to launder money

His goal is to place the cash in a financial institution where he can transfer it electronically to any place he chooses. There are endless ways he could do it. Some of these include:

He can put the money in a suitcase or box and then drive sail or fly to another country one with more accommodating banking laws.

He can hire “money mules” to open dozens of small banking accounts designed to fly under the radar of the banking regulations.

He can open a business with large cash receipts such as a limousine service or a nail salon or an online auction house and hide the ill-gotten cash among the legal receipts.

He can buy high-value art for cash and then resell it showing a receipt for the legitimate sale of his art item.

These are just a few of the options open to him. Anti-money-laundering specialists like Murray spend their professional lives studying how the “laundrymen” do it and then figuring out how to thwart them.

Every time Murray and his colleagues can prevent any money-laundering the downstream benefits to society are enormous. In the case of human trafficking the more successful anti-money laundering efforts are the less reason traffickers have to engage in their hideous trade.

“We can’t stop all money-laundering” concedes Murray “but we can identify and prosecute as many of the criminals as we can. We are working to reduce as much suffering as we can.”

What keeps Murray going in this dark and daunting task? “I’m always looking forward to those times when I can say ‘Gotcha!’”",,,

Conformal coatings are a protective cover that could be a polymer or a chemical film that is applied on electronic circuits to give them long-lasting protection from moisture content and chemical contaminants in the air. These products maintain insulation cover ensure continuity of circuit board components and oversee functional integrity of the circuit board.

A huge market for consumer electronics rapid strides in medical equipment and the emergence of driverless cars are some of the important factors driving the conformal coatings industry. Furthermore the rise in disposable incomes and dependence on sleek electronic devices such as mobile phones laptops and other gadgets have fueled the growth of particular products that are mandatorily used in electronic components.

Material to protect sensitive information on PCB

Automotive is one of the most far-reaching segments for these products. The development of hybrid cars is consistently empowered by technology and witnesses a comfortably high growth rate being touted as an energy-efficient alternative. Electric cars and hybrid vehicles could give a more comfortable ride optimum fuel efficiency and use more electronic gadgets giving rise to the sophistication that is the foundation of EV’s.

Initially these products were the mainstays in medical and military products but with high cost per unit. But with innovations and with rising of material science prices have reduced considerably over the last few years. Recent technological nuances in the market include low viscosity solvent-free conformal coating parylene-like hydrophobic conformal coating and single component conformal coating material to protect sensitive information on PCBs.

PCB assemblers favour conformal coatings for economic environmental reasons

These products are unique based on their material of formulation. These coatings are used bringing to the fore their characteristics and required efficiency. Acrylic conformal coating is the largest product segment by material. Polyurethane epoxy and parylene are amongst the fast-growing segments.

Most of the product manufacturers device fabricators and printed circuit board (pcb) assemblers favour conformal coatings for economic and environmental reasons though solvent-based ones prop up performance. A move towards green chemicals has certain resins moving at a faster rate as compared to traditional ones such as acrylics.

Top-booked Airbnb Online Experiences during the MCO include family-friendly virtual scavenger hunts magic shows and cooking Experiences hosted overseas

As Malaysia looks to reopen domestic travel in the coming months Airbnb continues to steadily navigate the COVID-19 pandemic with hundreds of new local Hosts joining the platform in the first six months of 2021.

Over 60% of new Airbnb Hosts in H1 2021 comprised millennials aged between 25-40. The top five states where these new Hosts were based are Selangor Kuala Lumpur Johor Sabah and Penang. Amidst the stop-start nature of Movement Control Order regulations from January to June new Airbnb Hosts collectively earned over RM680000 from welcoming guests on Airbnb*.

This data follows Airbnb’s recent global announcement of more than 100 new upgrades across the platform including making it easier to start hosting. Based on a Q1 2021 survey conducted by Airbnb a third of Malaysian Hosts polled said the money earned through Airbnb provided an additional source of revenue for the household and helped them stay afloat and fight costs of living during the pandemic**.

“2021 has undoubtedly proved challenging as the pandemic continues to impact Malaysian livelihoods businesses and the broader economy. Hosting has offered many an additional source of income during a time of financial strain providing economic empowerment for these new hosts.” Amanpreet Bajaj Airbnb’s General Manager for Southeast Asia India Hong Kong and Taiwan

“As the conversation turns towards the return of travel it is crucial that guest and Host safety remains Airbnb’s top priority. Last year we implemented the 5-step Enhanced Clean process a set of cleaning and sanitisation standards that were developed in partnership with experts and endorsed by the Malaysian Medical Association (MMA) to ensure peace of mind for our community. We remain fully committed to supporting Malaysia’s tourism recovery efforts and we continue working hard to find new ways to drive clean and safe travel” he added.

Australia’s cultural capital is an exciting place to visit no matter the time of year as you can always find something relating to style sport or art happening in its various communal spaces or down hidden laneways. And with it being home to a high number of cool restaurants bars and pubs there’s plenty to keep you occupied.

Stately Gold Rush architecture blends seamlessly with edgy street art and hip art galleries. Trendy coffee shops and independent bookstores mix with iconic music venues and boutique menswear stores.

There are gardens for the outdoorsy – including a number of walking routes both in the Melbourne’s Central Business District (CBD) and further afield – races and stadiums for the sports-mad and more laneway eateries than a foodie could ever hope to feast at.

Every traveller knows that the best way to experience a city is to do as the locals do so skip the hotel – although if you must stay in one Melbourne is home to some amazingly cool boutique hotels – on your next trip and book of the best Melbourne Airbnbs.

Should you be worried?

A federal judge has given a green light for a class-action lawsuit claiming that Apple's Siri voice assistant violates users’ privacy.

Earlier this month U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White said the plaintiffs would be allowed to move forward with lawsuits trying to prove that Siri routinely recorded their private conversations because of ""accidental activations"" and that Apple provided the conversations to advertisers according to Reuters. The plaintiffs claim that Apple violated the federal Wiretap Act and California privacy law among other claims.

This is happening against a backdrop of surging smart speaker sales.

As of June 2021 the installed base of smart speakers in the U.S. reached 126 million units jumping from 20 million units in June 2017 according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP).

Amazon has the biggest slice of the installed base with 69% as of June of this year.

Should you be worried? How to protect yourself

Amazon Apple and Google all offer smart speakers that use variations of voice assistant technology that is activated when users say key words such as ""Hey Siri"" for Apple devices or ""OK Google"" for Google products or ""Alexa"" for Amazon smart devices.

Amazon devices store that data when activated with a key word or so-called wake word. ""No audio is stored or sent to the cloud unless the device detects the wake word (or Alexa is activated by pressing a button)"" an Amazon spokesperson told FOX Business in an email.

""Customers have several options to manage their recordings including the option to not have their recordings saved at all and the ability to automatically delete recordings on an ongoing three- or 18-month basis"" the spokesperson added.

If you don’t want to be recorded by Alexa in the Alexa app go into the ""Privacy"" menu. Then go to ""Manage your Alexa data"" then ""Choose how long to save recordings."" Then select ""Don’t save recordings.""

Amazon collects and uses voice recordings to deliver and improve services according to the company. This includes helping train Alexa to better understand different accents and dialects and to provide the right response to requests.

Amazon also said it ""manually"" reviews data but does not sell it to third parties.

""To help improve Alexa we manually review and annotate a small fraction of one percent of Alexa requests. Access to human review tools is only granted to employees who require them to improve the service"" the Amazon spokesperson said.

Later executives called it ""Mario."" Both code names meant the same thing: a secret plan to break away from parent company Google.

DeepMind feared Google might one day misuse its technology and executives worked to distance the artificial-intelligence firm from its owner for years said nine current and former employees who were directly familiar with the plans.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

This included plans to pursue an independent legal status that would distance the group's work from Google said the people who asked not to be identified discussing private matters.

One core tension at DeepMind was that it sold the business to people it didn't trust said one former employee. ""Everything that happened since that point has been about them questioning that decision"" the person added.

Efforts to separate DeepMind from Google ended in April without a deal The Wall Street Journal reported. The yearslong negotiations along with recent shake-ups within Google's AI division raise questions over whether the search giant can maintain control over a technology so crucial to its future.

""DeepMind's close partnership with Google and Alphabet since the acquisition has been extraordinarily successful — with their support we've delivered research breakthroughs that transformed the AI field and are now unlocking some of the biggest questions in science"" a DeepMind spokesperson said in a statement. ""Over the years of course we've discussed and explored different structures within the Alphabet group to find the optimal way to support our long-term research mission. We could not be prouder to be delivering on this incredible mission while continuing to have both operational autonomy and Alphabet's full support.""

A is for Alphabetization

When Google acquired DeepMind in 2014 the deal was seen as a win-win. Google got a leading AI research organization and DeepMind in London won financial backing for its quest to build AI that can learn different tasks the way humans do known as artificial general intelligence.

But tensions soon emerged. Some employees described a cultural conflict between researchers who saw themselves firstly as academics and the sometimes bloated bureaucracy of Google's colossal business. Others said staff were immediately apprehensive about putting DeepMind's work under the control of a tech giant. For a while some employees were encouraged to communicate using encrypted messaging apps over the fear of Google spying on their work.

At one point DeepMind's executives discovered that work published by Google's internal AI research group resembled some of DeepMind's codebase without citation one person familiar with the situation said. ""That pissed off Demis"" the person added referring to Demis Hassabis DeepMind's CEO. ""That was one reason DeepMind started to get more protective of their code.""

After Google restructured as Alphabet in 2015 to give riskier projects more freedom DeepMind's leadership started to pursue a new status as a separate division under Alphabet with its own profit and loss statement The Information reported.

DeepMind already enjoyed a high level of operational independence inside Alphabet but the group wanted legal autonomy too. And it worried about the misuse of its technology particularly if DeepMind were to ever achieve AGI.

Internally people started referring to the plan to gain more autonomy as ""Watermelon"" two former employees said. The project was later formally named ""Mario"" among DeepMind's leadership these people said.

""Their perspective is that their technology would be too powerful to be held by a private company so it needs to be housed in some other legal entity detached from shareholder interest"" one former employee who was close to the Alphabet negotiations said. ""They framed it as 'this is better for society.'""

In 2017 at a company retreat at the Macdonald Aviemore Resort in Scotland DeepMind's leadership disclosed to employees its plan to separate from Google two people who were present said.

At the time leadership said internally that the company planned to become a ""global interest company"" three people familiar with the matter said. The title not an official legal status was meant to reflect the worldwide ramifications DeepMind believed its technology would have.

Later in negotiations with Google DeepMind pursued a status as a company limited by guarantee a corporate structure without shareholders that is sometimes used by nonprofits. The agreement was that Alphabet would continue to bankroll the firm and would get an exclusive license to its technology two people involved in the discussions said. There was a condition: Alphabet could not cross certain ethical redlines such as using DeepMind technology for military weapons or surveillance.

In 2019 DeepMind registered a new company called DeepMind Labs Limited as well as a new holding company filings with the UK's Companies House showed. This was done in anticipation of a separation from Google two former employees involved in those registrations said.

Negotiations with Google went through peaks and valleys over the years but gained new momentum in 2020 one person said. A senior team inside DeepMind started to hold meetings with outside lawyers and Google to hash out details of what this theoretical new formation might mean for the two companies' relationship including specifics such as whether they would share a codebase internal performance metrics and software expenses two people said.

DeepMind and Google leadership at odds over AI ethics

From the start DeepMind was thinking about potential ethical dilemmas from its deal with Google. Before the 2014 acquisition closed both companies signed an ""Ethics and Safety Review Agreement"" that would prevent Google from taking control of DeepMind's technology The Economist reported in 2019. Part of the agreement included the creation of an ethics board that would supervise the research.

Despite years of internal discussions about who should sit on this board and vague promises to the press this group ""never existed never convened and never solved any ethics issues"" one former employee close to those discussions said. A DeepMind spokesperson declined to comment.

DeepMind did pursue a different idea: an independent review board to convene if it were to separate from Google three people familiar with the plans said. The board would be made up of Google and DeepMind executives as well as third parties. Former US president Barack Obama was someone DeepMind wanted to approach for this board said one person who saw a shortlist of candidates.

DeepMind also created an ethical charter that included bans on using its technology for military weapons or surveillance as well as a rule that its technology should be used in ways that benefit society. In 2017 DeepMind started a unit focused on AI ethics research composed of employees and external research fellows. Its stated goal was to ""pave the way for truly beneficial and responsible AI.""

A few months later a controversial contract between Google and the Pentagon was disclosed causing an internal uproar in which employees accused Google of getting into ""the business of war.""

Google's Pentagon contract known as Project Maven ""set alarm bells ringing"" inside DeepMind a former employee said. Afterward Google published a set of principles to govern its work in AI guidelines that were similar to the ethical charter that DeepMind had already set out internally rankling some of DeepMind's senior leadership two former employees said.

Who will control the AI?

In April Hassabis told employees in an all-hands meeting that negotiations to separate from Google had ended. DeepMind would maintain its existing status inside Alphabet. DeepMind's future work would be overseen by Google's Advanced Technology Review Council which includes two DeepMind executives Google's AI chief Jeff Dean and the legal SVP Kent Walker.

But the group's yearslong battle to achieve more independence raises questions about its future within Google.

Google's commitment to AI research has also come under question after the company forced out two of its most senior AI ethics researchers. That led to an industry backlash and sowed doubt over whether it could allow truly independent research.

Ali Alkhatib a fellow at the Center for Applied Data Ethics told Insider that more public accountability was ""desperately needed"" to regulate the pursuit of AI by large tech companies.

For Google its investment in DeepMind may be starting to pay off. Late last year DeepMind announced a breakthrough to help scientists better understand the behavior of microscopic proteins which has the potential to revolutionize drug discovery.

As for DeepMind Hassabis is holding on to the belief that AI technology should not be controlled by a single corporation. Speaking at Tortoise's Responsible AI Forum in June he proposed a ""world institute"" of AI. Such a body might sit under the jurisdiction of the United Nations Hassabis theorized and could be filled with top researchers in the field.

""It's much stronger if you lead by example"" he told the audience ""and I hope DeepMind can be part of that role-modeling for the industry.""

If they had a conscience — or at least a fear of consequences — they could fess up and give them back pay owed. Google instead shrugged and dragged its feet on a remedy when it discovered that it had likely shorted some of its thousands of overseas temp workers for years according to the New York Times and the Guardian.

The Times reported Friday that internal Google documents and emails reveal that the “gap in so-called benchmark rates between what Google paid full-time employees and temporary workers doing similar work had widened significantly” potentially meaning the company was breaking the law in nations where similar levels of pay are mandated for similar positions. Google managers allegedly noticed the discrepancy but didn’t act to raise pay rates by the 20%-30% required to solve the problem mainly out of fear a sudden adjustment would alert the press that something was screwy.

In sum the Times wrote Google may have shortchanged workers in at least 16 countries with pay parity laws around $US100 ($136) million over nine years. The paper noted that tally doesn’t include fines it could face from regulators or the cost of any resulting lawsuits. Though there is no U.S. pay parity law a whistleblower reported the issue to the Securities and Exchange Commission in June 2021 saying Google had failed to notify investors of a potentially costly risk.

According to a separate report by the Guardian Google executives were aware of the issue since at least May 2019.

The Times reported that while Google took care to pay bonuses to temps in some countries with equal pay laws to bring them closer to parity Google execs identified at least 16 others including Brazil Canada Australia and Mexico where the tech giant never bothered to identify or comply with equal pay laws. Google also fell afoul of similar laws in the United Kingdom according to the Guardian.

Google employs over 150000 temps and contractors and executives may have been particularly wary courtesy of numerous media reports that many of those workers are treated like second-class citizens within Google. The vast majority of them work for “vendors” that handle outsourced tasks like the emotionally taxing job of moderating content the Guardian wrote. But thousands of temps hired via staffing agencies work at Google reporting to Google managers. The Guardian wrote that they receive pay amounting in the neighbourhood of $US800 ($1085) million annually and largely work in marketing recruitment and Waymo the self-driving car company owned by Google parent company Alphabet.

What happened the Guardian reported was that Google reviewed all of its temp roles in Europe the Middle East and Africa in 2012 and 2013 as well as Asia in 2017 to set comparison pay rates that were sent out to staffing companies. Then no one bothered to update the rates. The Guardian reported that Adrienne Crowther an executive whose portfolio included Google’s extended workforce team appears to have noticed the discrepancy on May 15 2019. In the interim Google’s compensation for full-time workers had risen by double-digit percentages meaning the benchmark rates were way too low.

“Yikes! This seems WAY too old” Crowther reportedly wrote. Alan Barry a Google compliance manager in Ireland wrote back that he agreed and that Google should “refresh” the data as part of a larger project regarding the future of temp workers at the company.

Google then spent at least two years paying the temps based on the old pay scales all while behind the scenes Google bigwigs — who were presumably being paid well more than the legal minimum — debated how to prevent it from tarnishing their reputation.

One solution cooked up by the brain trust: Applying the correct rates for temp workers newly hired in 2021 and after and letting the old temps phase-out. According to the Guardian Crowther fellow Google exec Deepak Negi and its employment lawyers signed off on this plan.

One document from October 2020 the Guardian wrote touted the so-called “natural correction” plan because of “the current low risk of a parity claim the ability to correct rates and not make a great deal of noise and the ability to correct rates without immediate substantial financial impact to [Google’s departments].” In an email obtained by the Times dated to December 2020 Barry reportedly wrote that raising rates for all temps would be best from a “compliance perspective” (i.e. the law) but doing so could let workers “connect the dots.” This would put Google’s temp staffing contractors in a “difficult position legally and ethically” with a “significant” cost and “a flurry of noise/frustration.”

“I’m also not keen to invite the charge that we’ve allowed this situation to persist for so long that the correction required is significant” Barry added according to the Times somewhat understating the situation.

By February 2021 Google execs had shifted to a plan in which new temps would be hired according to new payscales then backdating pay increases for existing temps. The plan didn’t include any accommodations for workers that had already left Google the Guardian wrote.

Additionally the Times established that in some cases temp jobs were paid on benchmark rates based on lumps of unrelated jobs with one Google manager writing in an email they feared it was artificially lowering salaries. Another email the paper reviewed showed that a Google manager advised a colleague to set the pay rate for a temp role by comparing it to the “lowest common denominator” among full-time staff.

Google told the Times that it has already begun adjusting the pay rates but also that many of the temps were making over the amounts established by the benchmark rates and/or had received raises during the time period it failed to update them.

“While the team hasn’t increased the comparator rate benchmarks for some years actual pay rates for temporary staff have increased numerous times in that period” Google chief compliance officer Spyro Karetsos told the Guardian in a statement. “Most temporary staff are paid significantly more than the comparator rates.”

“Nevertheless it’s clear that this process has not been handled consistent with the high standards to which we hold ourselves as a company” Karetsos added.

“… In short we’re going to figure out what went wrong here and we’re going to make it right.”

Google didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment from Gizmodo but we’ll update when we hear back.

A federal judge has given a green light for a class-action lawsuit claiming that Apple's Siri voice assistant violates users’ privacy.

Earlier this month U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White said the plaintiffs would be allowed to move forward with lawsuits trying to prove that Siri routinely recorded their private conversations because of ""accidental activations"" and that Apple provided the conversations to advertisers according to Reuters. The plaintiffs claim that Apple violated the federal Wiretap Act and California privacy law among other claims.

Amazon Apple and Google all offer smart speakers that use variations of voice assistant technology that is activated when users say key words such as ""Hey Siri"" for Apple devices or ""OK Google"" for Google products or ""Alexa"" for Amazon smart devices.

Amazon devices store that data when activated with a key word or so-called wake word. ""No audio is stored or sent to the cloud unless the device detects the wake word (or Alexa is activated by pressing a button)"" an Amazon spokesperson told FOX Business in an email.

""Customers have several options to manage their recordings including the option to not have their recordings saved at all and the ability to automatically delete recordings on an ongoing three- or 18-month basis"" the spokesperson added.

This included plans to pursue an independent legal status that would distance the group's work from Google said the people who asked not to be identified discussing private matters.

One core tension at DeepMind was that it sold the business to people it didn't trust said one former employee. ""Everything that happened since that point has been about them questioning that decision"" the person added.

Efforts to separate DeepMind from Google ended in April without a deal The Wall Street Journal reported. The yearslong negotiations along with recent shake-ups within Google's AI division raise questions over whether the search giant can maintain control over a technology so crucial to its future.

""DeepMind's close partnership with Google and Alphabet since the acquisition has been extraordinarily successful — with their support we've delivered research breakthroughs that transformed the AI field and are now unlocking some of the biggest questions in science"" a DeepMind spokesperson said in a statement. ""Over the years of course we've discussed and explored different structures within the Alphabet group to find the optimal way to support our long-term research mission. We could not be prouder to be delivering on this incredible mission while continuing to have both operational autonomy and Alphabet's full support.""

A is for Alphabetization

When Google acquired DeepMind in 2014 the deal was seen as a win-win. Google got a leading AI research organization and DeepMind in London won financial backing for its quest to build AI that can learn different tasks the way humans do known as artificial general intelligence.

But tensions soon emerged. Some employees described a cultural conflict between researchers who saw themselves firstly as academics and the sometimes bloated bureaucracy of Google's colossal business. Others said staff were immediately apprehensive about putting DeepMind's work under the control of a tech giant. For a while some employees were encouraged to communicate using encrypted messaging apps over the fear of Google spying on their work.

At one point DeepMind's executives discovered that work published by Google's internal AI research group resembled some of DeepMind's codebase without citation one person familiar with the situation said. ""That pissed off Demis"" the person added referring to Demis Hassabis DeepMind's CEO. ""That was one reason DeepMind started to get more protective of their code.""

After Google restructured as Alphabet in 2015 to give riskier projects more freedom DeepMind's leadership started to pursue a new status as a separate division under Alphabet with its own profit and loss statement The Information reported.

DeepMind already enjoyed a high level of operational independence inside Alphabet but the group wanted legal autonomy too. And it worried about the misuse of its technology particularly if DeepMind were to ever achieve AGI.

Internally people started referring to the plan to gain more autonomy as ""Watermelon"" two former employees said. The project was later formally named ""Mario"" among DeepMind's leadership these people said.

""Their perspective is that their technology would be too powerful to be held by a private company so it needs to be housed in some other legal entity detached from shareholder interest"" one former employee who was close to the Alphabet negotiations said. ""They framed it as 'this is better for society.'""

In 2017 at a company retreat at the Macdonald Aviemore Resort in Scotland DeepMind's leadership disclosed to employees its plan to separate from Google two people who were present said.

At the time leadership said internally that the company planned to become a ""global interest company"" three people familiar with the matter said. The title not an official legal status was meant to reflect the worldwide ramifications DeepMind believed its technology would have.

Later in negotiations with Google DeepMind pursued a status as a company limited by guarantee a corporate structure without shareholders that is sometimes used by nonprofits. The agreement was that Alphabet would continue to bankroll the firm and would get an exclusive license to its technology two people involved in the discussions said. There was a condition: Alphabet could not cross certain ethical redlines such as using DeepMind technology for military weapons or surveillance.

In 2019 DeepMind registered a new company called DeepMind Labs Limited as well as a new holding company filings with the UK's Companies House showed. This was done in anticipation of a separation from Google two former employees involved in those registrations said.

Negotiations with Google went through peaks and valleys over the years but gained new momentum in 2020 one person said. A senior team inside DeepMind started to hold meetings with outside lawyers and Google to hash out details of what this theoretical new formation might mean for the two companies' relationship including specifics such as whether they would share a codebase internal performance metrics and software expenses two people said.

DeepMind and Google leadership at odds over AI ethics

From the start DeepMind was thinking about potential ethical dilemmas from its deal with Google. Before the 2014 acquisition closed both companies signed an ""Ethics and Safety Review Agreement"" that would prevent Google from taking control of DeepMind's technology The Economist reported in 2019. Part of the agreement included the creation of an ethics board that would supervise the research.

Despite years of internal discussions about who should sit on this board and vague promises to the press this group ""never existed never convened and never solved any ethics issues"" one former employee close to those discussions said. A DeepMind spokesperson declined to comment.

DeepMind did pursue a different idea: an independent review board to convene if it were to separate from Google three people familiar with the plans said. The board would be made up of Google and DeepMind executives as well as third parties. Former US president Barack Obama was someone DeepMind wanted to approach for this board said one person who saw a shortlist of candidates.

DeepMind also created an ethical charter that included bans on using its technology for military weapons or surveillance as well as a rule that its technology should be used in ways that benefit society. In 2017 DeepMind started a unit focused on AI ethics research composed of employees and external research fellows. Its stated goal was to ""pave the way for truly beneficial and responsible AI.""

A few months later a controversial contract between Google and the Pentagon was disclosed causing an internal uproar in which employees accused Google of getting into ""the business of war.""

Google's Pentagon contract known as Project Maven ""set alarm bells ringing"" inside DeepMind a former employee said. Afterward Google published a set of principles to govern its work in AI guidelines that were similar to the ethical charter that DeepMind had already set out internally rankling some of DeepMind's senior leadership two former employees said.

Who will control the AI?

In April Hassabis told employees in an all-hands meeting that negotiations to separate from Google had ended. DeepMind would maintain its existing status inside Alphabet. DeepMind's future work would be overseen by Google's Advanced Technology Review Council which includes two DeepMind executives Google's AI chief Jeff Dean and the legal SVP Kent Walker.

But the group's yearslong battle to achieve more independence raises questions about its future within Google.

Google's commitment to AI research has also come under question after the company forced out two of its most senior AI ethics researchers. That led to an industry backlash and sowed doubt over whether it could allow truly independent research.

Ali Alkhatib a fellow at the Center for Applied Data Ethics told Insider that more public accountability was ""desperately needed"" to regulate the pursuit of AI by large tech companies.

For Google its investment in DeepMind may be starting to pay off. Late last year DeepMind announced a breakthrough to help scientists better understand the behavior of microscopic proteins which has the potential to revolutionize drug discovery.

As for DeepMind Hassabis is holding on to the belief that AI technology should not be controlled by a single corporation. Speaking at Tortoise's Responsible AI Forum in June he proposed a ""world institute"" of AI. Such a body might sit under the jurisdiction of the United Nations Hassabis theorized and could be filled with top researchers in the field.

""It's much stronger if you lead by example"" he told the audience ""and I hope DeepMind can be part of that role-modeling for the industry.""

If they had a conscience — or at least a fear of consequences — they could fess up and give them back pay owed. Google instead shrugged and dragged its feet on a remedy when it discovered that it had likely shorted some of its thousands of overseas temp workers for years according to the New York Times and the Guardian.

The Times reported Friday that internal Google documents and emails reveal that the “gap in so-called benchmark rates between what Google paid full-time employees and temporary workers doing similar work had widened significantly” potentially meaning the company was breaking the law in nations where similar levels of pay are mandated for similar positions. Google managers allegedly noticed the discrepancy but didn’t act to raise pay rates by the 20%-30% required to solve the problem mainly out of fear a sudden adjustment would alert the press that something was screwy.

In sum the Times wrote Google may have shortchanged workers in at least 16 countries with pay parity laws around $US100 ($136) million over nine years. The paper noted that tally doesn’t include fines it could face from regulators or the cost of any resulting lawsuits. Though there is no U.S. pay parity law a whistleblower reported the issue to the Securities and Exchange Commission in June 2021 saying Google had failed to notify investors of a potentially costly risk.

According to a separate report by the Guardian Google executives were aware of the issue since at least May 2019.

The Times reported that while Google took care to pay bonuses to temps in some countries with equal pay laws to bring them closer to parity Google execs identified at least 16 others including Brazil Canada Australia and Mexico where the tech giant never bothered to identify or comply with equal pay laws. Google also fell afoul of similar laws in the United Kingdom according to the Guardian.

Google employs over 150000 temps and contractors and executives may have been particularly wary courtesy of numerous media reports that many of those workers are treated like second-class citizens within Google. The vast majority of them work for “vendors” that handle outsourced tasks like the emotionally taxing job of moderating content the Guardian wrote. But thousands of temps hired via staffing agencies work at Google reporting to Google managers. The Guardian wrote that they receive pay amounting in the neighbourhood of $US800 ($1085) million annually and largely work in marketing recruitment and Waymo the self-driving car company owned by Google parent company Alphabet.

What happened the Guardian reported was that Google reviewed all of its temp roles in Europe the Middle East and Africa in 2012 and 2013 as well as Asia in 2017 to set comparison pay rates that were sent out to staffing companies. Then no one bothered to update the rates. The Guardian reported that Adrienne Crowther an executive whose portfolio included Google’s extended workforce team appears to have noticed the discrepancy on May 15 2019. In the interim Google’s compensation for full-time workers had risen by double-digit percentages meaning the benchmark rates were way too low.

“Yikes! This seems WAY too old” Crowther reportedly wrote. Alan Barry a Google compliance manager in Ireland wrote back that he agreed and that Google should “refresh” the data as part of a larger project regarding the future of temp workers at the company.

Google then spent at least two years paying the temps based on the old pay scales all while behind the scenes Google bigwigs — who were presumably being paid well more than the legal minimum — debated how to prevent it from tarnishing their reputation.

One solution cooked up by the brain trust: Applying the correct rates for temp workers newly hired in 2021 and after and letting the old temps phase-out. According to the Guardian Crowther fellow Google exec Deepak Negi and its employment lawyers signed off on this plan.

One document from October 2020 the Guardian wrote touted the so-called “natural correction” plan because of “the current low risk of a parity claim the ability to correct rates and not make a great deal of noise and the ability to correct rates without immediate substantial financial impact to [Google’s departments].” In an email obtained by the Times dated to December 2020 Barry reportedly wrote that raising rates for all temps would be best from a “compliance perspective” (i.e. the law) but doing so could let workers “connect the dots.” This would put Google’s temp staffing contractors in a “difficult position legally and ethically” with a “significant” cost and “a flurry of noise/frustration.”

“I’m also not keen to invite the charge that we’ve allowed this situation to persist for so long that the correction required is significant” Barry added according to the Times somewhat understating the situation.

By February 2021 Google execs had shifted to a plan in which new temps would be hired according to new payscales then backdating pay increases for existing temps. The plan didn’t include any accommodations for workers that had already left Google the Guardian wrote.

Additionally the Times established that in some cases temp jobs were paid on benchmark rates based on lumps of unrelated jobs with one Google manager writing in an email they feared it was artificially lowering salaries. Another email the paper reviewed showed that a Google manager advised a colleague to set the pay rate for a temp role by comparing it to the “lowest common denominator” among full-time staff.

Google told the Times that it has already begun adjusting the pay rates but also that many of the temps were making over the amounts established by the benchmark rates and/or had received raises during the time period it failed to update them.

“While the team hasn’t increased the comparator rate benchmarks for some years actual pay rates for temporary staff have increased numerous times in that period” Google chief compliance officer Spyro Karetsos told the Guardian in a statement. “Most temporary staff are paid significantly more than the comparator rates.”

“Nevertheless it’s clear that this process has not been handled consistent with the high standards to which we hold ourselves as a company” Karetsos added.

“… In short we’re going to figure out what went wrong here and we’re going to make it right.”

Google didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment from Gizmodo but we’ll update when we hear back.

Here's how,"Did you know Amazon offers a few secret discounts only available through your smart speaker or display? In June during Amazon Prime Day I noticed a couple of these Alexa-only discounts offering even more savings than the run-of-the-mill discounts. Take for example the Alexa-only deal on Amazon's Blink Mini security camera.

If you kept reading past the Prime Day discounted price of $20 (already $15 lower than the regular $35 price) you would have come across this jaw-dropper: ""Only $14.99 when you order with Alexa."" That's almost 60% off!

I chucked two of them in my Amazon shopping cart (using my voice of course) then immediately emailed Amazon to ask why in the name of Blue Origin is it making customers jump through Alexa hoops for Prime Day in order to get the very best deals?

(Although fun fact: Alexa-only deals were a thing well before Prime Day and they continue to be a thing after.)

Shopping by voice with Alexa isn't exactly easy but it's not terribly difficult either. Julie Snyder/CNET

Later that evening Director for Alexa Shopping Marie-Eve Logan got back to me: ""With our Alexa deals we're making it easier for customers to discover products and access savings by just using their voice.""

I may not be as fluent in PR as a native speaker but the word ""easier"" struck me as key because it's a tacit acknowledgement that shopping by voice is actually kind of hard and Amazon wants it not to be. What then makes difficult things easier to do?

You can Buy It Now when shopping with Alexa but if it's just the discounts you're after adding the item to your cart with Alexa is all you need to do to get them. Chris Monroe/CNET

Answer: Practice (I hear it can even make perfect).

In other words Amazon wants its customers to practice shopping by voice until it gets easier. Although I imagine perfect might be a bit too lofty of a goal challenge accepted. Here's how to get started.

First make sure Alexa hears you

Like many Alexa adventures a shopping excursion on your Amazon Echo device should begin in the settings menu. Alexa is going to serve up individual deals then expect you to respond to each of them one at a time. Thing is Alexa will glitch out and drop that cadence unless Follow-up Mode is turned on like so:

1. Open the mobile Alexa app and tap Devices on the bottom menu bar.

2. Tap Echo & Alexa on the top menu bar then scroll to the device you'll be shopping on.

3. Scroll down and tap on Follow-up Mode then tap the toggle to turn it on (if it's not already).

4. Back out to your list of devices and repeat as necessary.

You'll have to toggle on Follow-up Mode for each Amazon Echo smart speaker you want to shop from or -- better yet -- you can use an Amazon Show smart display instead if that's an option. (I'll explain the advantages to shopping on an Echo Show in a bit -- spoiler alert: it helps that you can see what you're buying -- but otherwise this guide is designed for shoppers limited to voice commands and responses.)

Be sure to turn on Follow-up Mode in Alexa settings or else Alexa won't be listening for your responses. Dale Smith/CNET

The key to Alexa shopping is this one command

Once you've made sure Follow-up Mode is on every shopping excursion with Alexa should begin with these five words: ""Alexa what are my deals?"" That was the go-to command before Prime Day 2021 and will continue to be long after.

What happens next is quite tedious -- you're really earning these discounts. Alexa will start reading one by one from a list of deals. (They're not exclusive to you by the way -- they're ""yours"" the same way Amazon wants you to make everything you see on its site yours by selling it to you.)

After each listing Alexa will ask if you want to add the item to your cart or hear the next deal. Just like shopping on Amazon with taps and clicks you can also Buy It Now but you don't have to. Merely adding the item to your cart will get you the Alexa-only discounted price so you might as well check out on a device where you can see what you're getting.

All you need to do to get started shopping with Alexa is say ""Alexa what are my deals?"" Chris Monroe/CNET

Shopping on an Echo Show feels familiar

Let's face it as smart displays advance further and further they're basically turning into mounted tablets not unlike Amazon's own Fire line of devices (just less mobile). So it's not much of a shocker that asking Alexa for your deals on an Echo Show smart screen feels much like shopping in the Amazon mobile app albeit more limited.

It's helpful to see exactly what you're putting into your shopping cart on an Echo Show and you aren't inundated with clutter like you are on other screen devices. If you have an Echo Show and you want to shop Alexa deals you should use it.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS90ZWNobm9sb2d5L2FwcGxlLWdvb2dsZS1hbWF6b24tc3B5aW5nLWxhd3N1aXRz0gFOaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm94YnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvYXBwbGUtZ29vZ2xlLWFtYXpvbi1zcHlpbmctbGF3c3VpdHMuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Apple Google Amazon spying on you lawsuits claim,"Big Tech is listening to your private discussions lawsuits claim. Should you be worried?

A federal judge has given a green light for a class-action lawsuit claiming that Apple's Siri voice assistant violates users’ privacy.

Earlier this month U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White said the plaintiffs would be allowed to move forward with lawsuits trying to prove that Siri routinely recorded their private conversations because of ""accidental activations"" and that Apple provided the conversations to advertisers according to Reuters. The plaintiffs claim that Apple violated the federal Wiretap Act and California privacy law among other claims.

Should you be worried? How to protect yourself

Amazon Apple and Google all offer smart speakers that use variations of voice assistant technology that is activated when users say key words such as ""Hey Siri"" for Apple devices or ""OK Google"" for Google products or ""Alexa"" for Amazon smart devices.

Amazon devices store that data when activated with a key word or so-called wake word. ""No audio is stored or sent to the cloud unless the device detects the wake word (or Alexa is activated by pressing a button)"" an Amazon spokesperson told FOX Business in an email.

""Customers have several options to manage their recordings including the option to not have their recordings saved at all and the ability to automatically delete recordings on an ongoing three- or 18-month basis"" the spokesperson added.

If you don’t want to be recorded by Alexa in the Alexa app go into the ""Privacy"" menu. Then go to ""Manage your Alexa data"" then ""Choose how long to save recordings."" Then select ""Don’t save recordings.""

Amazon collects and uses voice recordings to deliver and improve services according to the company. This includes helping train Alexa to better understand different accents and dialects and to provide the right response to requests.

Amazon also said it ""manually"" reviews data but does not sell it to third parties.

""To help improve Alexa we manually review and annotate a small fraction of one percent of Alexa requests. Access to human review tools is only granted to employees who require them to improve the service"" the Amazon spokesperson said.

""Our annotation process does not associate voice recordings with any customer identifiable information. Customers can opt-out of having their voice recordings included in the fraction of one percent of voice recordings that get reviewed"" the spokesperson said.

By default Google doesn’t retain your audio recordings José Castañeda a Google Spokesperson told Fox Business. ""We dispute the claims in this case and will vigorously defend ourselves"" Castañeda said in a statement.

Labor rights experts and workers praised the passage of a first-of-its-kind bill in California aimed at empowering warehouse employees at Amazon and other companies that use algorithms to enforce quotas — often pushing them to skip breaks and work unsafely in order to “make rate.”

The state Senate’s passage of Assembly Bill 701 — which was expected to pass in the state Assembly on Friday three months after the chamber approved its own version of the legislation — would require companies to disclose to the government and to their employees the quotas that are used to track productivity prohibit penalties for “time off-task” and bar companies from retaliating against workers who complain about the metrics used.

Workers would also be empowered to sue companies that continue to use quotas if they keep employees from taking bathroom breaks and following safety guidelines as has been widely reported at Amazon’s fulfillment centers in the U.S. and abroad.

As the workers’ rights platform Organise reported in a survey taken in 2018 74% of Amazon warehouse workers avoided taking bathroom breaks for fear of not meeting quotas for packing merchandise and more than half of the workers said they had suffered from depression since working for the e-commerce giant.

As Common Dreams reported in June data Amazon provided to the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) showed that Amazon employees sustain injuries more often than workers at other warehouses. Serious injuries were reported about 80% more often among Amazon workers than other employees.

Journalist James Bloodworth reported after going undercover as an Amazon warehouse employee that his coworkers frequently urinated in plastic bottles to avoid taking the time to go to the restroom — a practice that’s also been reported among the company’s delivery drivers as the company was forced to admit earlier this year.

One former Amazon employee who is now an organizer with the Warehouse Worker Resource Center Yesenia Barrera told The Guardian that she only learned she was being surveilled at work when she injured herself and her manager saw through the scanner she was using that she went “off-task” due to the injury.

“It is really stressful and physically demanding to keep up” Barrera told the outlet. “They never tell us how much we are doing you are never really sure how well you are doing — we are just told to keep going.”

California Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez told The New York Times last week that in writing the legislation she aimed to take on “this increased use of quotas and discipline based on not meeting the quotas without a human factor in dealing with a reason why a worker might not make a quota.”

Athena the nationwide grassroots coalition of advocacy groups fighting Amazon’s labor practices hailed the passage of A.B. 701 as an “historic victory.”

Dr. Beth Gutelius research director at the Center for Urban Economic Development at the University of Illinois Chicago told the Times that it is “unprecedented for a bill to intervene like this in the ways that technology is used in the workplace.”

Republican lawmakers in California who opposed the legislation have claimed companies like Amazon — which reported a net income of $21.3 billion in 2020 up $10 billion from the year before and a revenue of more than $386 billion — will be forced to raise prices due to the cost of complying with the new legislation if Gov. Gavin Newsom signs the bill into law.

“It was on the backs of those workers that Amazon’s profits were supercharged during Covid and Jeff Bezos got richer by $70 billion” said Athena. “That’s 2.4 MILLION times what the median Amazon worker makes.”

“A.B. 701 is how we start winning our power and safety back” the coalition added.

Special to USA TODAY

Perhaps it’s no surprise we’ve been shopping online a lot more since the start of the pandemic.

In its latest quarterly earnings report Amazon announced it had increased its net income by more than 48% in the second quarter (April to June 2021) compared with the same period last year while total revenue rose about 27%.

What’s more Amazon shoppers spent nearly $11.2 billion on Amazon sites during the company’s two-day Prime Day which took place on June 21 and June 22 (and not all countries partook in Prime Day this year including Canada).

While brick-and-mortar stores are hoping to rebound this fall the benefits of online shopping remain clear: you can shop 24/7 in the comfort of your pajamas; you don’t have to fight traffic to drive to the mall and circle the parking lot; it’s easy to compare prices between multiple online retailers; and products are shipped right to your door.

If you’re reading this chances are you’re an Amazon customer but you might not be getting the most out of the country’s biggest online retailer.

And so take heed to these following tips and tricks – including some lesser-known ways – to ordering faster saving more getting faster shipping and more.

Prime it up

First an obvious one.

While many suffer from “subscription fatigue” – paying for internet TV mobile phone video streaming services a fitness membership satellite radio and so on – you’ll likely never complain about Amazon Prime.

For $119/year for an annual Prime membership (after a 30-day free trial) and $59/year for an annual student membership an Amazon Prime membership gives you a handful of advantages.

The big one is free express delivery on millions of items many of which may arrive the same day (or even within 2 hours for groceries). You’ll also get early exclusive access to some deals before non-Prime shoppers.

Other benefits include access to Amazon Prime Video (movies and TV shows) millions of ad-free songs with Prime Music free Kindle e-books and magazines unlimited photo back-up (in full resolution) and through Prime Gaming free games and in-game content Twitch access and other goodies.

Pro tip: Reviewed.com a USA TODAY company has also shared some tips to scoring Amazon Prime for less.

Amazon Coupons

Wait what?

Yep while many shoppers aren’t aware of it Amazon has a coupons section.

You can search by keyword or browse by category: Grocery Pets Health & Personal Care Electronics Toys & Baby Home & Kitchen Lawn & Garden and Fashion.

It may not be a lot – such as saving $2 on a box of dishwasher pods or 10% off LED light strips – but why pay more than you need it? It’s definitely worth your while to see what digital coupons are here before you buy. Click the deal to apply it to your purchase.

Be aware some coupons may only be available to Amazon Prime customers.

Plus Amazon.com also has a Deals tab featuring daily specials for new used or open box products. All the departments are listed along the left-hand side (such as Beautyand Electronics) including the option to select a price window (like “Under $25” or “$25 to $50”) or percentage of the discount (“10% Off or More” “25% Off or More” and so on).

Customize your search

As you likely know Amazon has (quite literally) millions of products and so a generic search for what you want may take a lot of time.

Unless of course you start narrowing down your search by taking advantage of the boxes you can tick along the left side of Amazon.com.

If you’re a member always start by ticking off Prime so you know that you’ll get what you’re buying delivered as fast as possible (and for free).

Then keep narrowing things down.

Select products that have only received a high rating from shoppers (such as four or five stars) select the desired price window and you can even select the brand you want.

If you’re buying an external hard drive for your laptop for example you can even specify how much storage you’re looking for such as one terabyte opposed to four terabytes.

Get to know these left-side search options to whittle down what you’re looking for.

Warehouse Deals

Just as you might shop at a thrift shop or second-hand store in person Amazon too has a Warehouse section with great deals on quality used or refurbished products.

(In fact there’s currently an Amazon Warehouse Back to School sale with up to 20% )

Here you can shop for millions of pre-owned and open-box items including used computers and tablets home and kitchen items unlocked mobile phones and “previously enjoyed” televisions.

Even though you’re buying a discounted Amazon Warehouse product many items qualify for Prime or free shipping.

But caveat emptor: these items generally do not come with a manufacturer’s warranty but all are backed by Amazon’s liberal return policy.

Maybe wait for Prime Day

Usually held once a year Amazon Prime Day is a two-day sales event where you can score great deals on several Amazon products (like Echo smart speakers and Kindle e-readers) as well as those from other companies.

Robotic vacuums coffeemakers and teeth-whitening strips were some of the top-selling products this past June.

Hey you know Prime Day is a big deal when the company hired three Grammy winners to perform: superstar Billie Eilish H.E.R. and rapper Kid Cudi.

If you don’t want to wait for Prime Day you can see what products are trending. Search for the hashtag #FoundItOnAmazon on social media sites like Instagram and Twitter and it may lead to the dedicated Amazon page “to browse and buy stylish brand and influencer finds all in one place.”

Shop hands-free

Tens of millions of Americans own an Amazon smart speaker such as the Echo Dot ($69) but did you know you can shop on Amazon by using your voice?

Say “Alexa order [product name]” “Alexa add [product name] to my basket” (to complete the order later) or “Alexa re-order [product name]” and your trusty personal assistant will walk you through the process.

You can also say something like “Alexa what are my deals?” (to hear about sales) “Alexa where’s my stuff?” (for order tracking info) or “Alexa add [product name] to my shopping list” (which you can access in the Alexa app).

If you like you can set up a confirmation code in your smartphone’s Alexa app to prevent anyone from abusing the purchase-by-voice feature.

Install a browser extension

While not exclusive to Amazon be sure to have a reputable browser extension like Honey to save money on purchases.

These tools keep an eye on what you’re about to purchase and tell you if the store you’re on has the best deal compared to other sites – before you buy – or if there’s a promo code or coupon you can apply before you check out.

Honey says users save an average of$126 a year and with an average discount of 17.9% (based on the company’s internal 2020 data).

To get going click to add Honey to your favorite web browser – be it Chrome Safari Edge Firefox or Opera – and shop online like you normally would."

The September 11 attacks (also referred to as 9/11) were a series of four coordinated terrorist attacks by the Islamic terrorist group al-Qaeda on the United States on the morning of Tuesday September 11 2001. The attacks killed 2997 people injured over 6000 others and caused at least $10 billion in infrastructure and property damage.

Four passenger airliners operated by two major U.S. passenger air carriers (United Airlines and American Airlines)—all of which departed from airports in the northeastern United States bound for California—were hijacked by 19 al-Qaeda terrorists.

Two of the planes American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175 were crashed into the North and South towers respectively of the World Trade Center complex in New York City. Within an hour and 42 minutes both 110-story towers collapsed with debris and the resulting fires causing partial or complete collapse of all other buildings in the World Trade Center complex including the 47-story 7 World Trade Center tower as well as significant damage to ten other large surrounding structures.

A third plane American Airlines Flight 77 was crashed into the Pentagon (the headquarters of the United States Department of Defense) in Arlington County Virginia leading to a partial collapse of the building’s western side. The fourth plane United Airlines Flight 93 initially was steered toward Washington D.C. but crashed into a field in Stonycreek Township near Shanksville Pennsylvania after its passengers tried to overcome the hijackers. 9/11 was the single deadliest incident for firefighters and law enforcement officers in the history of the United States with 343 and 72 killed respectively.

But Airport Security Forever Changed On 9/11,"It's hard to fathom now but we used to be able to arrive at the airport just minutes before a flight. We'd keep our shoes and coats on as we went through a simple metal detector and virtually anyone could go right to the gate without a boarding pass or even showing an ID.

The 19 Al-Qaeda affiliated terrorists who hijackedfour commercial jetliners on Sept. 11 2001 knew that and exploited our lax airport security measures strolling through metal detectors at four airport security checkpoints with ease with deadly weapons in hand. It allowed the hijackers to commandeer those airplanes and use them as jet fuel-filled missiles as they flew them into the twin towers of the World Trade Center the Pentagon and a field in Shankville Pa. killing nearly 3000 people.

""It was so easy a lot of us were surprised it hadn't happened sooner"" says Jeff Price who was assistant security director at Denver International Airport on Sept. 11 2001 and is now an aviation security expert at Metropolitan State University in Denver.

Airport security at that time was done by private contractors usually hired by the airlines with few federal standards. Those security contracts usually went to the lowest bidder.

""Before 9/11 security was almost invisible and it was really designed to be that way"" Price says. ""It was designed to be something in the background that really wasn't that noticeable and definitely did not interfere with aircraft or airport operations.""

""You could walk up to the gate at the very last minute. You did not have to have a boarding pass"" Price says. ""All you had to do was go through the security checkpoint; no questions asked no I.D. needed.""

That forever changed on Tuesday Sept. 11 2001.

Now travelers often stand in long lines at security checkpoints with wait times of up to an hour or longer. We take off our shoes empty our pockets and take laptops cell phones and other devices out of carry-on bags before stepping into a high-resolution full body scanner while our bags go through 3-D imaging X-ray machines hopefully without any liquid or gel of more than 3.4 ounces.

Some of us enroll in known or trusted traveler programs such as Pre-Check surrendering some of our privacy in an effort to have a smoother expedited screening process.

Aviation security experts acknowledge that prior to 9/11 no one envisioned suicide terrorists wanting to use commercial airplanes as weapons and willing to kill themselves in order to kill hundreds of innocent people.

Now counter-terrorism and homeland security officials in the federal government work to imagine the unimaginable and enhance defenses to prevent the ever changing and growing threats to aviation security.

Here's a lookat how airport security has evolved over the past 20 years.

Sept. 11 2001: Terrorists hijack and crash four passenger jets

The 19 hijackers checked in for their flights at the airport in Portland Maine at Boston's Logan Airport Newark's Liberty Airport and Dulles International in the Washington D.C. area.

When Mohamed Atta checked in at the Portland airport with a fellow hijacker for their short flight to Boston he was selected for additional scrutiny under what was then known as CAPPS (Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System). But according to the9/11 Commission report ""Under security rules in place at the time the only consequence of Atta's selection by CAPPS was that his checked bags were held off the plane until it was confirmed that he had boarded the aircraft. This did not hinder Atta's plans.""

Several of the other hijackers were flagged by CAPPS at the other airports but none were questioned and they were allowed to board in the same way Atta was — without much additional scrutiny. As they strolled through metal detectors at the airports a couple of the hijackers set off alarms. But were quickly cleared and sent on their way after going through a second metal detector or being scanned by a hand-held wand. It's not clear what exactly set off the alarms but according to the 9/11 commission report the hijackers used knives and/or razor blades in their attacks which they likely had on them or in their carry-on bags. Even if those weapons were detected it wouldn't have mattered.

""The FAA allowed knives of up to 4 inches in length on board an aircraft"" says aviation security expert Jeff Price. ""So even if the hijackers would have been caught with their knives prior to boarding the plane the screeners would have handed it right back to them. ""By 8 A.M. on the morning of Tuesday September 112001 they had defeated all the security layers that America's civil aviation security system then had in place to prevent a hijacking"" the 9/11 commission report states.

September and October 2001: Enhanced airport security fewer Americans flying longer wait times in airport security lines

After the planes hit the Twin Towers and the Pentagon the FAA immediately ordered all remaining commercial aircraft still in the air to land at the nearest available airport. All flights remained grounded for until Sept. 14. But when air travel did resume very few Americans were willing to fly. Nonetheless in the days and weeks after the stunning terrorist attacks airport security immediately intensified.

Armed National Guard soldiers joined local and state police in some cities to help patrol airports and screen travelers. Knives boxcutters razors and other types of blades were banned and the list of other items prohibited on aircraft grew significantly.

Several thousand National Guard have been called up around the country to ensure airport security in the wake of the Sept.11 terror attacks.

Airport security officers began searching through carry-on bags and patting down passengers and that according to Price is when wait times in the airport security lines started to grow longer even though few Americans were flying. He says authorities were ""slowing down the lines at the checkpoint to do a more thorough search of passengers and baggage.""

November 2001: The Aviation and Transportation Security Act creates TSA checked baggage screened by X-rays

Congress passed and President George W. Bush signed the law that would create the Transportation Security Administration which would become part of the newly created cabinet level Department of Homeland Security.

Shawn Thew / AFP via Getty Images / AFP via Getty Images U.S. Secretary of Transportation Norman Mineta (left) meets with CEOs of the major US Airlines including US Airways CEO Rakesh Gangwal (right) and Director of the Federal Aviation Administration Jane Garvey on Nov. 15 2001 in the Department of Transportation in Washington DC. Mineta called the meeting to discuss improvements in airport security.

In addition to creating the TSA the Aviation Transportation and Security Act required 100% of all checked baggage to be screened by X-rays the Federal Air Marshal Service was expanded to put more armed air marshals on many more flights and the law required airlines to reinforce cockpit doors on their aircraft to prevent attackers from entering.

The law also mandated that the TSA oversee security in all modes of transportation such as passenger rail (including Amtrak) and intercity bus travel. Experts say the TSA was a major step forward in improving security.

December 2001: The shoe bomber and how shoe removal at airport security checkpoints started

On Dec. 22 2001 on an American Airlines flight from Paris to Miami British-born terrorist Richard Reid tried to detonate explosives that he had packed in his shoes. Passengers subdued and restrained Reid as the flight was diverted to Boston the closest airport.

/ ABC News/Getty Images / ABC News/Getty Images This still frame from television footage obtained by ABC News and released Feb. 7 2002 shows the shoes worn by alleged shoe bomber Richard Reid.

Investigators later said Reid had enough explosive material to blow a hole in the fuselage of the plane but that rainy weather and Reid's foot perspiration made the fuse too damp to ignite. Reid pleaded guilty to eight terrorism related charges in October 2002 and was sentenced to three consecutive life sentences and 110 years with no possibility of parole. The incident led to the TSA and airlines asking passengers to voluntarily remove their shoes when going through screening at airport security checkpoints.

December 2002: Deploying explosives detection systems very detailed 3-D images

The TSA meets the mandate to screen 100% of all checked luggage by deploying machines that can scan bags for explosives and other dangerous weapons in every airport in the country.

The technology used in these screening systems has improved greatly over the intervening years according to Deb Scovel a TSA baggage and checkpoint supervisor at Chicago's O'Hare airport who says today's X-ray scanners are similar to CT scanners used in hospitals.

A handgun (right) inside a briefcase is displayed on the screen of the machine.

""The X-rays take images of it from all sides"" says Scovel ""so it does an all-around picture of whatever goes inside so you see it from every point of view."" She says the 3-D images are so detailed ""I can tell you the difference between Irish Spring and Dove soap yes I can. And officers that have been here a while can do the same thing. You can tell the difference between an Apple and a Dell laptop; they're very detailed.""

April 2003: Pilots start to carry firearms on board flights and other cockpit protections

The first pilots certified under a voluntary program allowing them to carry handguns were on board flights. President Bush signed the Arming Pilots Against Terrorism Act into law in November 2002 and the TSA began training flight deck personnel on how to use firearms on board if needed soon after.

Gary Wilcox / Getty Images / Getty Images Participants in the first class of commercial airline pilots who volunteered to carry handguns learn defense tactics April 17 2003 in Glynco Ga. as part of the Transportation Security Administration's Federal Flight Deck Officer Training program. The inaugural group of Federal Flight Deck Officer (FFDO) candidates spent the week learning how to use a handgun and defensive tactics.

Also that in April 2003 the TSA announced that all airlines had met the requirement to reinforce cockpit doors on their entire fleets of planes.

Pilots and their unions continue to push for additional cockpit barriers and fortifications to protect them from possible attacks from outside the cockpit.

August 2006: Liquids banned shoe removal mandated and more air marshals added

British authorities disrupted a terrorist plot to detonate liquid explosives on board 10 commercial aircrafts bound from London to various cities in the U.S. and Canada. U.K. prosecutors alleged the would-be bombers prepared to disguise the explosives as soft drinks in 500 ml branded plastic bottles.

As a result the TSA banned all liquids gels and aerosols from passenger carry-on luggage.

Mark Wilson / Getty Images / Getty Images Personal items of liquid and gel containers taken from passengers lie in a trash can at Dulles International Airport Aug. 10 2006 in Chantilly Va.

A month later in September the TSA lifts the ban on liquids and amends its rule to allow airline passengers to carry liquids gels and aerosols in containers of only 3.4 ounces or less in a single clear resealable 1-quart plastic bag that must be removed from carry-on baggage.

August 2006 is also when the TSA began to require all travelers to remove their shoes to be screened for explosives at airport security checkpoints.

The TSA also began deploying more federal air marshals including on international flights.

March 2008: Canine units join the airport security force

Although bomb-sniffing dogs were already being used in a limited capacity as part of transportation security the TSA began deploying canine teams to specifically aid in the screening of cargo loaded onto passenger aircraft at U.S. airports.

The program later expanded to use dogs to detect possible explosive materials on passengers and in checked and carry-on baggage.

December 2009: The ""underwear bomber"" and the installation of full body scanners

On Christmas Day on board a Northwest Airlines flight from Amsterdam to Detroit al-Qaeda extremist Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab tried to detonate an improvised explosive device that he had hidden in his underwear.

Abdulmutallab later told FBI agents he had been following the jetliner's path during the flight on his seat back screen as he wanted to blow up the plane over American soil. Inside his briefs he had explosive chemicals that would ignite when mixed. After going into the plane's lavatory to make final preparations he returned to his seat and pushed a plunger to mix the chemicals.

But the volatile mix didn't explode as he intended possibly from excess moisture after being inside his pants for so long. It only caught fire seriously burning Abdulmutallab who tried to get his burning pants off before fellow passengers and crew members subdued him

Abdulmutallab later pleaded guilty and was sentenced to life in prison.

In response to the failed attack in which a terrorist was able to sneak dangerous explosives through security in March of 2010 the TSA began installing hundreds of full body scanners using Advanced Imaging Technology.

By the end of 2010 approximately 500 AIT machines are deployed nationwide.

December 2011: TSA pre-check begins vetted travelers pay to go through shorter security lines

With hundreds of millions of travelers passing through the TSA's airport security checkpoints each day the agency wanted a better way to discern who was and who wasn't a serious threat. So it started its known and trusted traveler program to provide expedited screening for those willing to pay for it and undergo a more detailed background check.

The TSA says it makes risk assessments about passengers prior to their arrival bat an airport checkpoint via these thorough background checks. Vetted travelers pay $85 for five years get to go through a shorter security line where they no longer have to remove shoes and belts.

The TSA meanwhile says it is able to focus resources on more high-risk and unknown passengers.

JUNE 2015: TSA flunks undercover tests

The TSA's Inspector General reported that TSA officers failed to detect weapons explosives and other prohibited items smuggled through various airport security checkpoints by undercover agents 95% of the time.

The astronomically high failure rate led to the reassignment of Melvin Carraway who was then the acting TSA director. It also prompted significant changes in TSA training and procedures including enhanced screening and increased random searches.

March and June 2016: ISIS attacks outside Turkey airport security perimeter and ""a flawed approach to security""

In June three suicide bombers who had been turned away at the airport security checkpoint opened fire with semi-automatic weapons before detonating explosive belts at Ataturk airport's international terminal in Istanbul Turkey killing themselves and 45 other people while injuring more than 200.

Ozan Kose / AFP via Getty Images / AFP via Getty Images Bullet impacts are pictured on a window at Ataturk airport's International airport on June 29 2016 a day after a suicide bombing and gun attack targeted Istanbul's airport killing at least 36 people.

That deadly assault followed a similar coordinated terrorist attack in the airport terminal and a subway station in Brussels Belgium just three months earlier that killed 32 people and injured more than 300. The incidents raised concerns about what security experts call soft targets outside the hard security perimeter where large groups of people wait at baggage claim line up at check in counters and kiosks and line up to go through the security checkpoint

Some critics including counter-terrorism expert Tom Mockaitis at Chicago's DePaul University say it exposes a flawed approach to security.

""I've seen in this country us waste literally millions of dollars on what I call placebo security - highly visual measures like armed guards strutting up and down in our airports you know creating a feeling of well-being and a feeling of security without providing any real added benefit"" Mockaitis told NPR in July of 2016.

March 2017: The laptop ban

The Trump Administration citing threats gathered from credible intelligence sources prohibited travelers from certain countries from bringing laptops tablets and other large electronic devices on board commercial flights to the U.S.

Fethi Belaid / AFP via Getty Images A Libyan traveller packs his laptop in his suitcase before boarding his flight for London at Tunis-Carthage International Airport on March 25 2017. The United States announced a ban on all electronics larger than a standard smartphone on board direct flights out of eight countries across the Middle East in effect from March 25 2017.

John Kelly secretary of Homeland Security at the time said the intelligence indicated that terrorists were developing bombs powerful enough to bring down an airplane but small enough to be hidden inside those devices. The laptop ban affected travelers from 10 airports in eight mostly Middle Eastern countries with majority Muslim populations.

""We didn't feel at the time that overseas airports had the kind of security initially that could give me a comfort that they could detect this device the airports in those countries"" Kelly said a couple of months after the ban was imposed.

The laptop ban was lifted in July 2017.

June 2017 - Facial recognition biometric screening and privacy concerns

In 2017 some airlines in collaboration with the TSA began trials of facial recognition software that allows a passenger's face to be their boarding pass.

The system takes a photo and matches that with one on file with the airlines speeding up the passenger screening process and provides greater customer convenience. And because users of the system must be enrolled in the federal government's known traveler program it provides an extra layer of security.

But this and other biometric screening methods which could allow the government to track your whereabouts at home and abroad raise significant privacy concerns as NPR's Asma Khalid reported.

Aviation security experts say the TSA's efforts to expand the use of facial recognition and biometric screening was significantly delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic but could begin to ramp up again in the next couple of years.

September 2021: Still room for improvement but layers of hard and soft security

TSA officials say aviation security continues to evolve to address ever changing threats with a layered approach that involves surveillance intelligence and technology. The agency has 65000 employees and spends billions each year in an effort to stay one step ahead of potential foreign and domestic terrorists. [do you know how many they were pre-9/11? There were none. TSA didn't exist]

""People are very creative the threats are very creative"" says Traverzo adding ""It's up to us to anticipate that and it's up to us to look at those things and try to come up with ideas to counter methods"" that terrorists may come up with.

There hasn't been a successful attack against commercial aviation in this country in the 20 years since 9/11 and outside experts agree that while there is still room for improvement TSA has been effective in preventing another terrorist attack.

The Federal Aviation Administration took the unprecedented step of grounding flights nationwide.

Five hijackers took control of American Airlines Flight 11 one of four hijacked planes that day and the Boeing 767 heading out of Boston and intended for Los Angeles detoured instead to New York. During the last 25 minutes of her life Ong using the aircraft’s emergency line to speak to ground crews calmly provided information about the hijackers and injuries to passengers and crew. When the jet crashed into the North Tower at 8:46am – the first of two planes to fly into the towers – at 755km an hour (470mph) Ong along with the other 10 crew members and 81 passengers died.

These were all that was left of Ong a 45-year-old Chinese-American flight attendant who was the first to alert authorities of the attacks of September 11 2001 when nearly 3000 lives were lost.

On a spring day in 2002 Cathie Ong-Herrera received a call from the New York City Medical Examiner’s office. At the base of where the North Tower of the World Trade Centre used to stand she was told a two-inch thigh bone and some soft tissue had been recovered and identified. They matched the DNA of Cathie’s younger sister Betty Ann Ong.

The deadly terrorist attacks against the United States on September 11 2001 prompted an outcry around the world: “We are all Americans.” Washington’s policies realigned around fighting terrorism and bilateral relationships strengthened or crumbled depending on where other governments stood. In the latest in a series about the legacy of September 11  Jodi Xu Klein recounts the memories of Betty Ann Ong the Chinese-American flight attendant who raised the first alarm about the hijackings that day.

In 2004 Ong was declared “a true American hero” by Thomas Kean chairman of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States better known as the 9/11 Commission.

Her family takes that recognition as a great solace.

“Betty was an American. She is considered a hero because of what she did” Cathie said last week. “The US when September 11 happened was a country where we were all one. We were all helping each other.”

But 20 years later Ong’s family still grieves for a loved one whose life was cut brutally short.﻿

Born on February 5 1956 Betty – known in the family as Bee – was the youngest of four siblings in the San Francisco household of Chinese descent. Betty along with her two sisters Cathie and Gloria and their brother Harry were third-generation Americans. Both sets of grandparents had emigrated from China sometime after World War I. Her father Harry Ong Sr and mother Oy Yee-gum ran a popular jerky shop in Chinatown.

Growing up in the city’s Chinatown the sisters would travel to San Francisco International Airport to watch planes take off. Always fascinated by travel Betty began her aviation career in the baggage claim department with PSA Airlines in the 1980s then with Delta Air Lines as a ticket agent.

It wasn’t until 1987 that Ong became a flight attendant with American Airlines a dream job. It was her choice to fly mostly between Boston and California so she could come home to San Francisco.

As a family the Ongs are tightly knit so close to one another that the entire group – parents and siblings alike – would go shopping together for someone’s shoes. When Betty joined American Airlines the sisters would go on trips together.

That summer of 2001 the sisters were planning another trip this time to Hawaii.

In a long last email to Cathie Betty said she was working extra flights so she could go on the trip.

“Silly me for working so hard” Cathie recalled Betty writing.

That was September 9. Betty offered to take a September 11 shift for a colleague – ending up on Flight 11.

When Flight 11 crashed Cathie had barely started her day in Bakersfield California. She and Betty were supposed to meet for lunch in Los Angeles later that day to discuss their plans for their first “sister trip” since visiting Tokyo together more than 10 years earlier.

Early that morning Cathie’s phone rang. It was Harry who she said told her to turn the TV on because “an historical event was taking place.”

As the siblings watched the stunning scenes considering the two smouldering towers to be simply a news event Harry asked Cathie where Betty was. He said he’d heard that the planes that had flown into them were flights originating in Boston.

“My heart sank” Cathie said. “I called Betty’s cell phone and received a busy signal and it gave me hope that she was trying to call us to tell us that she was OK.”

Throughout the day they tried desperately to reach her and get information from the airline; Cathie grew too agitated to stay put. She and her husband decided to drive up to her parents’ home in San Francisco. Somewhere during the trip she heard an American Airlines ground crew member say on a news report that somebody from Flight 11 had made a phone call giving reports of the hijacking.

“When I heard that I knew that if Betty was on that plane it would be her because she was just that kind of person brave and helpful” Cathie said.

The next call Cathie got from Harry was bad news: American Airlines confirmed that Betty was on the plane.

“I remember telling my husband that I needed to get out of the car so we pulled off into the parking lot of a mall. And it was about 8 o’clock at night and I was just shocked crying and looking up at the sky and shouting ‘why why why!’”

When they got to her parents’ house Reverend Norman Fong a minister at Chinatown’s Presbyterian Church was already there. Fong was Cathie’s oldest friend since childhood but they had not been in touch in years.

Fong became a driving force behind a decade-long campaign to commemorate Ong.

“It was difficult. She wasn’t recognised as a hero at first” recalled Fong 69 who retired recently as the executive director at the San Francisco Chinatown Community Development Centre. He and the family wanted a building named after Betty but repeated attempts to rename one of the public schools Betty attended failed.

Fong didn’t give up though and solicited support from the San Francisco recreation and parks department as well as then-mayor Ed Lee to rename the Chinatown community centre in her honour.

The newly renovated Betty Ann Ong Chinese Recreation Centre reopened in the summer of 2012; the sprawling 2230 sq metre (24000 sq ft) facility hosted a wide range of events for children and senior citizens alike until the pandemic restricted activities.

In 2004 Cathie created the Betty Ann Ong Foundation which runs summer camps offering active living and healthy eating for children. The foundation now also raises funds for sports activities at the recreation centre.

“I want to mirror Betty’s spirit of her love for children. And I want to keep her legacy. All I knew was it would be about children because that was what Betty loved” Cathie said.

For a year after her sister’s death Cathie said she was in denial. She didn’t want to talk to anyone about Betty because discussing her meant admitting that Betty was gone. So she made up a story that Betty was “walking around New York with amnesia and that she would soon come home to tell us that she was OK”.

In 2017 – 16 years after the Hawaii trip that never materialised – Cathie went to the Hawaiian island of Maui to speak about her sister at the Rotary club there.

“I thought about Betty a lot on the trip because that was where my sister and I were going to go. Talking to the audience about my sister in Hawaii was difficult but it brought me some closure” she said.

The family used to attend the September 11 commemorative events in New York City every year until recently when it became too difficult for their mother Oy now 96 to travel across the country. When the pandemic hit the family opted for retreats nearby.

Cathie now 70 said that her sister’s death “made us as a family stronger. It made us closer than we were before.”

“We tell each other we love each other more. Almost every conversation ends with ‘I love you’. In that sense it changed us.”

It also gave the family pride: they know in their heart that because of what Betty did many lives were saved.

“I figured Betty is in heaven an angel there for sure” Fong said. “I would say ‘Thank you for what you did not just for our country but for all the Chinatown kids cross-country’. They have a hero a beautiful hero.”

Fong who came out of retirement this year to continue community work to battle anti-Asian hate said it was heartbreaking to witness the rising anger aimed at Chinese-Americans.

He said that a group of teenagers in a car had recently yelled at him to “go back to China”.

“Until America sees the Chinese-Americans as Americans too we still have a long way to go” Fong said.

“Fear is the main enemy in life. There is a lot of fear from hate. Betty overcame her fear to help save America. A lot of us have to step up to help the most vulnerable” he added.

Cathie said that every time she hears about hate crimes she thinks about her sister’s heroism. “I can feel the pain the victims and the families of these violence must be feeling” she said.

Betty’s recovered remains were buried at Cypress Lawn Memorial Park in Colma California on the San Francisco Peninsula. Cathie has lit candles for her sister since 2001. After their father Harry Ong Sr died in 2007 she’s lit candles for them both.

“I will light candles for Betty and my dad for the rest of my life every night. I stare up into the sky and talk to the stars. Many times it’s very comforting because I see shooting stars and I feel that they are still with me.”

“In many ways our family feels very fortunate because we know what Betty’s last moments were like because of her phone call” Cathie said. “And there is some part of Betty that came home.”

Mehrlich whose presentation was recorded and uploaded on the airport's Facebook page spoke to a group about 15 to 20 airport employees.

He opened his presentation with facts about the attack and paid a moving tribute to first responders as well as response in general.

""Twenty years today at 8:46 a.m Eastern Standard Time American Airlines flight 11 struck the north tower of the World Trade Center in New York City"" he said. ""This plane carried 81 passengers and 11 crew members. Throughout the morning three other aircraft were also hijacked - United Airlines 175 which struck the World Trade Center's south tower American Airlines Flight 77 which hit the Pentagon and United Flight 93 which crashed outside Pittsburg Pennsylvania.

""Only 56 minutes after the first impact the south tower collapsed. In all 2977 people died that day creating the deadliest terrorist act in world history. To date over 2000 more have died with illnesses caused by the attack.""

Mehrlich said the country's response to the attack was more revealing than the nature of the attack itself.

""Our country wasn't defined by the acts that occurred that day but instead by the response to it"" he said. ""The New York Fire Department response time to 9/11 was five seconds and 343 firefighters along with other emergency personnel died.

""Thousands more poured in to assist and pull survivors from the rubble. They truly earned the right to be called the nation's bravest and finest.

""In the days and weeks that followed the nation came together. It was as if we as a nation looked in the mirror and saw the best that was within us and we promised that we would never forget the lives of those who were stolen from us - and those who had given their own lives to protect us.""

Mehrlich paid tribute to the first responders.

""It is said that the greatest generation were the men and women who fought in World War II  because they sacrificed so much for our freedom and stood in the face of pure evil. However on 9/11 we saw that you didn't need to be a soldier to be a hero.

""The heroes that day were firemen policemen emergency responders and regular people. These included co-workers who stopped to help others in burning buildings and neighbors who dug through the twisted metal - searching for survivors. The passengers on United 93 knowing their fate took it upon themselves to storm the cockpit of their aircraft to save others' lives.""

Mehrlich then said the terrorists' goals wound up having a reverse effect.

""These terrorists tried to destroy us but instead they discovered that we are indivisible and that we would always fight for liberty and justice for all. Recent events have caused many of us to wonder if the sacrifices made during the last 20 years. were worth it.

""Sine 2001 more the 7000 American troops have died in the War on Terror. These individuals who fought for freedom for the person standing next to them and for the liberty of citizens in Afghanistan did so with honor courage and commitment. For 20 years we have been able to go to sleep at night knowing someone was out there keeping terror from returning to our shores.""

Mehrlich concluded by urging people to thank Transportation Safety Administration staff law enforcement officers  firefighters airport staff and armed service members.

""God bless the men and women who stand up for this country every day and God bless America"" he said."

A look at the data » Yale Climate Connections,"[Leer en español]

As the U.S. economy recovers from the COVID-induced recession the emphasis is shifting away from the simplified metric of the number of jobs toward a focus on high-quality high-paying jobs. As some service sectors languish with unfilled positions and shorthanded staffing the energy industry pays premium wages. Energy workers are paid 34% more than the median U.S. wage according to the 2020 U.S. Energy and Employment wage report.

A bygone talking point of the fossil fuel era was that high-paying oil gas and coal jobs are irreplaceable. But the data show a more encouraging reality: Clean energy jobs pay well are plentiful and are poised for major growth for the foreseeable future.

Comparing wages across energy sectors

Homer Simpson of “The Simpsons” made at least one good decision in his life – nuclear energy generation is the top breadwinner in the energy industry according to wage data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).

The Department of Labor agency data show parity between wages in the fossil fuel industry and renewables with solar electricity generation edging out each of the fossil fuel sectors and wind being comparable to fossil fuels. That said BLS does not track the wind and solar industries as closely as it does fossil fuels. For example wind and solar jobs are tallied only within the utility sector and not in manufacturing wind and solar components. Nevertheless the high wages in renewable electricity generation are an encouraging sign that top-dollar energy jobs will be part of the transition toward cleaner energy sources.

A closer look at energy wages

The 2020 U.S. Energy and Employment Report’s supplement on Wages Benefits and Change takes a deeper dive into energy wages. The report pulls together different aspects of each energy sector so that entire industries can be analyzed as a whole and compared to each other.

At first the results will seem to contradict the BLS data. The difference is that this tally captures industry-wide wages in contrast to BLS data that examine only certain slices of each industry. In the industry-wide comparison fossil fuels offer slightly higher wages than renewables. Taking a deeper look will show where those wage differences come from.

High-paying jobs are an important consideration as energy transitions from one industry to another and those jobs lead to a frequent rallying cry of those opposed to moving away from a fossil fuel-based energy economy. Regardless of the relatively small differences between sectors an important point is that all energy jobs pay well above the national average of $19 per hour and the non-extractive sectors are growing swiftly. The future of extractive industries’ employment is much less certain.

Comparing wage data by job type

The highest wage category in the energy industry is in electricity generation and power plant operations. Regardless of the energy source the pay is similar between fossil fuels and renewables with solar electricity generation edging out the others.

The next highest-earning occupations are in mining extraction and transportation of oil and gas. These jobs are frequently unionized and are known to offer high pay high risk and uncertain stability. But these extraction-based occupations do not exist in the wind or solar energy industries because no fuel is required to generate electricity from the wind or sun. In other words there is no analog for mining and drilling jobs: The fossil fuel industry has them. Renewables don’t.

Coal mining stands out in contrast to other extraction jobs fetching a much lower salary than a comparable job in oil and gas. The low pay may be partly explained by the fact that many coal mines are located in areas with little economic diversity such as rural West Virginia and Wyoming. Another factor may be that coal companies are facing a starkly shrinking market.

Looking at other occupations one finds that a given job pays similar wages across each of the energy sectors: Manufacturing jobs tend to offer comparable pay regardless of which industry is doing the manufacturing. This wage parity applies to construction trade professional services and maintenance.

Each industry has a different blend of job types

Another difference between energy sectors is the proportion of people employed within various occupations. In the following comparison the contrasts between each sector become more apparent. The chart below is complicated so the bullet points coming after it walk through the main takeaways.

In the petroleum industry the largest category of employment is in extraction and there is little work in electricity generation because most petroleum is used for transportation fuels.

For natural gas electricity generation edges out extraction in terms of the number of people employed though both categories are large.

Extraction is the largest occupation within the coal industry and it’s important to note that coal employs far fewer people than oil and gas.

Construction jobs dominate the solar industry which explains why solar energy overall has lower wages compared to fossil fuels. Construction is a lower-paying occupation than oil and gas extraction. That said solar construction pays more than coal mining and employs far more workers so that’s one example where a shift toward cleaner energy can replace lower-wage jobs with higher-paying jobs. Lastly solar construction jobs are numerous – in part because many solar installations are on smaller residential projects that tend to be labor-intensive.

Wind industry jobs are led by construction with professional services and manufacturing close behind. Wind energy is the smallest employment sector in the energy industry though it’s a reasonable bet that wind will surpass coal in the near future.

Grid jobs employ over 800000 people who plan build and maintain the nation’s electricity network; this is a massive sector and one that’s frequently overlooked. The bulk of grid jobs are in construction and utilities. A modern grid is an essential element of re-tooling energy systems to accommodate diverse sources of electricity generation and this sector is expected to grow rapidly. The pending infrastructure bill on Capitol Hill includes a $73 billion investment into the grid.

Boom bust and other trends in energy employment

Careers in oil gas and coal have traditionally offered high pay but little in the way of job security. The industry is infamous for its cycles of boom and bust some times growing or shedding tens of thousands of jobs in the course of a year or two. The rise and fall of Bakken oil in North Dakota is just one recent example.

One driver of oil and gas employment is the price of oil and as seen in the graph above ebbs and flows in the value of crude oil foretell losses and gains in the size of the fossil fuel employment pool. The period from 2014 to 2017 offers a vivid case study as the industry lost 30% of its workforce in the wake of a steep drop in oil prices.

The trend for coal mining jobs is solidly down. Mining has had small upticks but none of the larger bubbles enjoyed by the oil and gas industry. Coal mining has lost over 48000 jobs since a brief rally in 2011 a decline of 54% in just 10 years.

Renewable jobs gaining ground on fossil fuels

Casting a wider net to look at employment trends between fossil fuels and renewables the two appear to be heading in opposite directions: Fossil fuel extraction is declining wind and solar are on the upswing.



Note that the fossil fuel jobs plotted here are only for the extraction side of the industry. These make up the majority of jobs in fossil fuels but not all of them. That explains why wind jobs appear more numerous than coal jobs in this graphic but are fewer than coal in a previous graph.

If anything bouncing back and forth between datasets and ways of comparing the industries shows that care must be taken to accurately wrap one’s head around the employment picture in various energy fields. A superficial talking point may not reflect the realities of the situation.

Solar workforce: More watts per worker

The 2020 Solar Jobs Census report gives a detailed look at solar employment trends over the past 10 years. Jobs in solar energy grew sharply in the first half of the decade then leveled off. Solar installations grew steadily until 2016 then declined for three years before setting a new high mark in 2020 despite COVID-related shutdowns and slowdowns.

In a counterintuitive turn of events the solar workforce in 2020 was smaller than in previous years while the installed capacity of new solar panels was the highest to date. The explanation to this seeming contradiction is that solar projects are getting larger with a shift toward more utility-scale solar farms in addition to smaller-scale residential systems. A trend toward larger systems means the number of installed panels per worker has increased.

Enormous jobs growth ahead for wind and solar

The growth of wind and solar employment is projected to be somewhere between brisk and explosive depending on which public policy path the U.S. pursues. The Bureau of Labor Statistics is projecting 50% growth for solar photovoltaic installers and 60% increase for wind energy technicians by 2029. The Solar Jobs Census is far more bullish forecasting 150% expansion in the solar workforce over the same time span with current energy policies and 300% growth if President Biden’s goal of 100% clean electricity by 2030 is enacted into law.

The Net Zero America study led by Princeton University forecasts a wholesale reshaping of the energy industry as a result of switching to low- or zero-emissions energy sources over coming decades. The upshot is that energy employment across the country will nearly double and as the data at the outset of this analysis show jobs in the energy economy earn well more than others in the general economy. This shift would bring an infusion of high-paying stable careers to the U.S. job market.

The coming boom in energy jobs has a lot to offer: Long-term employment with high wages new technologies and investment in the future of American energy. And these jobs will result in less pollution for everyone.

Limiting the damage caused by future disasters will require a whole-of-government approach — one not limited to what the federal government can do. There’s a host of ideas that states and municipalities could implement to curb greenhouse gas emissions particularly in some of the world’s biggest polluters: American cities.

According to a 2021 study published in Frontiers Houston Chicago and Los Angeles have some of the highest per-capita emissions totals in the world. The study broke down cities’ emissions based on sector using the most recently available data (from 2009 and 2010) and found a large portion of those emissions come from transportation.

Data from the EPA shows that the transportation sector is actually the biggest source of pollution in the US and that light-duty vehicles (or passenger cars) are responsible for 58 percent of those emissions. Overall the EPA’s research — and the 2021 study — reinforce the fact that the transportation systems of American cities over-rely on cars in ways that are not sustainable should the US actually want to approach its stated greenhouse gas reduction goal of 50 percent by 2030 a number it has to reach in order to limit global warming by 1.5 degrees Celsius or less.

Reducing driving is difficult however because American cities particularly those across the Southwest are built for drivers. Biking and walking are often not options and public transit where it exists does not typically serve trips that do not involve going from a city’s outskirts to its downtown or back.

“There’s really only one rational way to get where you’re going and it’s typically not direct” said Jeff Speck a city planner and the author of Walkable City. “It’s typically organized around the assumption of driving as the only viable transportation mode.”

The greenhouse gases produced by this reality are not inevitable. They’re underwritten by federal state and local policy from the initial construction of the interstate highway system to the recent bipartisan infrastructure bill where the $39 billion in new funding for public transit is dwarfed by $110 billion for improving expanding and building new highways bridges and roads.

Transforming American cities to be more walkable isn’t easy but there are measures local authorities can take to create a safer more democratized transportation ecosystem that can positively affect the climate crisis. I spoke with several urban planners transportation scholars and advocates to learn about the most important strategies for curbing car reliance in cities. From those conversations arose the following solutions — all of which are implementable on the municipal level.

Make streets safer for bikes and pedestrians

Many of the car trips that people take are within biking distance — say to dinner or an activity like a movie theater. But people may choose to drive because riding would be dangerous. They might have to cross a highway or bike down roads where there are no bike lanes.

Places where bike ownership thrives — which can be as big as a city like Amsterdam which has such a widespread bike network that cycling is favored over driving or just a college campus — have prioritized bike and pedestrian safety over cars.

Americans only love the college experience because it's the only time in their lives they live in walkable communities — ¡ ! (@Bro_Neill) January 10 2021

In most American cities particularly in the suburbs that’s not the case. And when the efficient movement of cars is considered paramount over the safety of any other mode accidents and fatalities occur. The car-centric transportation system is contributing to a consistent yearly uptick in pedestrian casualties; they rose 21 percent in 2020 according to the Governors Highway Safety Association (GHSA).

“The problem is the minute you leave the local [road] you probably enter an environment in which it’s not safe to bike because the bike lanes aren’t separate” Speck said.

By adding protected bike lines — separated from car lanes by a barrier for safety — biking becomes a safe accessible alternative to shorter drives. Essentially bike lanes have to be set apart by something other than “a scrap of paint” said Ralph Buehler the chair of Urban Affairs and Planning at Virginia Tech. This is something that became clear during the first year of the pandemic: the GHSA found that 2020’s uptick in pedestrian deaths came despite traffic decreasing by up to about 42 percent at the peak of the pandemic. Reducing traffic alone doesn’t make biking and walking safer; the streets themselves need to be redesigned with safety in mind.

This sort of redesign also incentivizes walking and biking. Speck’s research has found converting 12- to 14-foot-wide driving lanes into 10-foot-wide lanes slows average car speeds from 40 miles per hour to 25 miles per hour and creates room to either add bike lanes or street-side parallel parking which better protects the sidewalk from traffic.

And relatively inexpensive changes like turning one-way streets into two-way streets or lowering the curb radius so that cars slow down more when they make right turns are also proven to reduce crashes and injuries Speck said.

Studies conducted in cities that have made such changes have found marked decreases in car use. Oslo has redesigned its roads in high pedestrian traffic areas such that 91 percent have speed limits under 40 miles per hour while expanding its system of bike lanes. It saw a 77 percent increase in bike traffic between 2014 and 2020.

There are American examples too. In Philadelphia an investment in miles of protected bike lanes led to a nearly 70 percent increase in the number of people who biked to work from 2010 to 2017 even as congestion and public transit use worsened.

Buehler added that for such changes to be successful there also needs to be connectivity across areas. If you’re taking a shorter trip to pick up takeout or grab a few groceries much of it may be bike- or pedestrian-friendly — except for a critical highway juncture. To promote walking and biking cities need to ensure that routes exist for human-powered transportation to every place the average person needs to go.

When I lived in Madrid I could walk or take transit practically everywhere without ever crossing a highway that had no pedestrian infrastructure. I would take 30-minute walks home in the middle of the night from clubs when the Metro was not running. Even in the dark there were no crossings where I was unprotected as a pedestrian.

Examples of similar connectivity can also be found in the US Buehler said most commonly with respect to schools.

“There’s a safe-route-to-school program that tries to design safe routes to school” Buehler said. “You can also think about that to community centers. The main point is designing networks.”

Safe routes to school are a start but to really promote biking and walking cities need to develop safe routes to other places like drugstores and restaurants as well. There’s a very large obstacle to doing this at the moment however: zoning.

End single-family zoning to encourage mixed-use development

On its face single-family zoning is a housing policy that creates quiet uncrowded neighborhoods by restricting the development of apartments townhouses or any other dwelling that’s not a freestanding home. It’s incredibly prevalent in the US (75 percent of residential land is single-family zoned) and as my colleague Jerusalem Demsas points out it is incredibly harmful. It has had a racist impact having been used to exclude people of color from certain neighborhoods and it overall increases the cost of housing by limiting supply.

Another problem with single-family zoning is that it encourages car usage: In areas zoned for single families there can be little development; the idea is people live in one area and then access workplaces leisure activities and stores via car.

“We zoned and created bento boxes” said Brian Jencek the director of planning at HOK a planning and design firm. “Never let the gravy and rice touch. ... Now we want stew but we have to undo over a century of American planning.”

The best way to make that stew is to create mixed-use development which facilitates what Jencek calls the 20-minute city meaning you’re never more than a 20-minute walk from everything you might need from jobs and schools to pharmacies and clinics to community centers and parks. In a mixed-use city that’s possible. But in most American suburbs single-family zoning does not allow for it.

Going back to my Madrid example mixed-use development meant that nearly everything was within walking distance. From my neighborhood I could walk to school stop at a bakery along the way get any beauty services at a salon on the way home and meet my friends for dinner at night. I walked or took public transit everywhere.

Compare that to my grandparents’ house in West Bloomfield Michigan a suburb of Detroit. Due to single-family zoning the only activity we can walk to is to see my cousins who also live in the suburb. Any restaurant appointment or shopping has to be a car trip.

Razing West Bloomfield and rebuilding it as a 20-minute city isn’t really feasible. But one change that could encourage the development of walkable cities over time Speck said is eliminating single-family zoning in areas that are within walking distance of transit stops. Doing so would encourage the development of commercial spaces which would benefit residents in the area; and those not living near the new services would be able to access them via public transit lessening the need for a car.

Upzoning near transit also means that homeowners could add accessory dwelling units or granny flats — a detached housing unit — on a lot Speck said helping to situate middle- and low-income people near transit easing the housing crisis and putting more people in walkable and transit-accessible communities.

While increased development is often associated with rising property values and gentrification Jencek said mixed-use development done with community input can create the economic benefits of development without pricing people out. The end result of rezoning would look different in different neighborhoods but does not necessarily mean a complete overhaul of a community. It could just mean adding a one-acre community park to a neighborhood without recreation access or creating a network of safer slower streets to invite restaurants to expand their outdoor seating.

The idea is simple: Add a new land use to a neighborhood creating an activity or business site that is accessible without a car.

Make drivers pay the costs of driving

The first two solutions focused on making driving less necessary. But people don’t always drive because they need to — they often do so because it is convenient and cheap.

It’s true that the upfront cost of a car is high and there is gas and insurance. But drivers’ other costs — road maintenance traffic lights and policing for instance — are heavily subsidized. Speck said estimates place the subsidization of driving at $10 for every dollar a driver spends as opposed to $1.50 for public transit.

Much of that subsidization comes in the form of taxes which people pay whether they drive or not but there are a lot of indirect costs as well: In higher-income households people use highways but do not have to pay for the noise and emissions in the low-income neighborhoods that highways run through for example. And the climate costs of mass driving affect everyone regardless of car ownership.

One solution to this is congestion pricing where drivers must pay a fee to drive in high-traffic areas or during peak hours. Central London imposes congestion pricing and New York City has plans to do so though they may not materialize. Another idea is to increase the gas tax so that actual drivers are paying the costs of car infrastructure rather than general taxation. Both of these price controls could disincentivize driving.

But many experts believe making driving less convenient would do more to limit car usage and one easy way to do this is to reduce the supply of parking.

Every mode of transportation needs a terminal. Planes have airports and boats have seaports both of which require travelers and companies to pay. But for cars parking “is capitalized into the costs of the goods you buy” Brian Taylor the director of the Institute of Transportation Studies at the University of California Los Angeles said. Think about your local grocery store — the parking lot is often larger than the actual commercial space and it’s free. The grocery store is expected to pay for the parking lot through the revenue it generates from sales.

“We treat that as sacrosanct” Taylor said. “The default is that the storage of private vehicles tends to get priority if you look at how we’ve allocated curb space. And that creates all sorts of problems.”

Delivery vehicles and rideshares that need to pull up on the curb have no space so they halt traffic. Traffic is generated by people circling and looking for parking knowing they can park on the street for free instead of paying for a garage. And because city governments mandate parking requirements for most types of development commercial development — and therefore connectivity — is stunted by the need for parking.

Most American cities require parking minimums meaning new apartment buildings and developments have to cordon off a certain amount of space for people to leave their car either for free or for a rate much lower than the market price considering how valuable that space is.

If cities removed their minimum parking requirements for developers there would be far less incentive to provide free parking. A private developer would likely still build some off-street parking — but they would charge for it.

In Los Angeles for example Taylor said the real cost of an underground parking space might be $60000. So a condo that costs $520000 and comes with two underground parking spaces could instead be sold at $360000 with owners offering parking at its real cost of $60000 per space. In that scenario a family might forgo a second car and get an electric bike instead.

To disincentivize street parking Taylor suggested municipalities raise the price at meters manage curbs differently or remove parking altogether in some areas and only allow loading unloading and scooter and bike traffic.

These are all strategies that would need to be rolled out in tandem with expanding connectivity particularly with public transit. It is easy to imagine a situation in which gas taxes and expensive meters begin to primarily hurt low-income communities with zero access to public transportation for instance. But once other options are in place imposing the costs of parking on drivers would make driving more like going to a restaurant for dinner Taylor said: You don’t do it every night but it’s enjoyable when you do.

“If people were more responsible in one way or another for those costs they’d be much more judicious of their use” Taylor said. “Instead of being the default of every trip it would be one among an array of choices that have advantages and disadvantages.”

What’s in the way of reducing car usage?

The free market did not create car supremacy by itself though the government played a big role. The government has the power to change how city-dwelling Americans use their cars but doing so on the scale needed to truly combat climate change isn’t easy.

City planners contend with regulations that promote driving and politicians who want to change those are often met with pushback from constituents. In overcoming this it’s important to remember that not every change needs to be a grand one — yes a gas tax hike might help but so will more popular measures like bike lanes. And incremental advances like new zoning regulations rolled out a few neighborhoods at a time for instance could have a large impact in the long run.

Also a multimodal city does not mean cars will be obsolete. Some trips like to a hardware store will always necessitate vehicles and there’s a role for ridesharing as well. But policies are needed to ensure other modes receive a fair shot. It’ll make us safer maybe happier and will give our planet a better chance of survival.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tL2xpdmUvMjAyMS8wOS8xMS9zcG9ydHMvdXMtb3Blbi13b21lbnMtZmluYWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Emma Raducanu Defeats Leylah Fernandez for the U.S. Open Title (Published 2021),"Emma Raducanu the 18-year-old British phenom completed a shocking run through the U.S. Open with a straight-sets victory over Leylah Fernandez of Canada on Saturday for a title that will surely go down as one of the great underdog journeys in the history of sports.

Raducanu ranked 150th in the world and barely known two weeks ago became the first player to win a Grand Slam title after surviving the qualifying tournament a scenario that may very well never be repeated. She also became the first woman from Britain to win a Grand Slam singles title since Virginia Wade won Wimbledon in 1977.

And she did it the way she had handled every other match she played in New York where she did not lose a set in 10 matches a remarkable 20-set streak and another feat that is unlikely to be repeated anytime soon. Saturday’s score line was a clean 6-4 6-3. “An absolute dream” Raducanu called it.

Raducanu’s game a rare mix of power and precision proved too much for Fernandez a quick and fearless counterpuncher who possesses deceptive power as well. On Saturday afternoon though in front of a packed Arthur Ashe Stadium where the crowd blanketed both players with love Fernandez simply ran out of points and punches as Raducanu’s laserlike shots to the deepest parts of the court kept landing just beyond the Canadian teenager’s reach.

After a tight first set during which both players had chances to grab the early lead Raducanu surged toward the finish line in the sixth game of the second set breaking Fernandez’s serve by blocking what looked like a sure putaway with a screeching forehand down the line.

Ever the fighter Fernandez saved two match points as she served at 2-5 to keep the match going. In the next game she sent Raducanu sprawling to the ground as she chased Fernandez’s shot deep to the corner. But Raducanu settled herself during a medical timeout to get a cut on her leg bandaged and five points later finished off the match with an ace. She collapsed on the court as the stadium exploded.

“I was just praying not for a double-fault” Raducanu would say of the finish just before she became the unlikeliest lifter of a Grand Slam trophy that tennis has ever seen.

Queen Elizabeth even chimed in sending out a statement from Balmoral Castle praising Raducanu for “a remarkable achievement at such a young age.”

This was the rarest of finals a contest between two players known only to the most faithful of tennis fans two weeks ago.

They had played once before in the Wimbledon junior tournament in 2018. Raducanu won that match in straight sets as well. But two years ago Raducanu was pretty sure her path would lead to college and a career in finance. She took her entrance exams earlier this year around the time that she was playing in the lower tier tournaments that earned her a wild-card entry into Wimbledon where she made her Grand Slam debut. This was her first summer of top-level competition.

Fernandez who turned 19 this week and is ranked 73rd was until a few days ago known as little more than a scrappy undersized battler. Few had predicted greatness for her. Some years back a teacher told her to give up the game because she would never amount to anything.

For tennis their stunning journeys to the final could not have come at a better time. The sport had landed in an awkward spot in the weeks leading up to this U.S. Open. Novak Djokovic arrived in New York trying to accomplish the rarest of tennis feats winning all four Grand Slam tournaments in a calendar year but most of the game’s biggest stars had fallen off the map. Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal announced they were skipping the tournament because of injuries as did Serena and Venus Williams.

Then on the first Friday night of the tournament Naomi Osaka the reigning champion and the biggest new star in tennis lost to Fernandez in three sets and announced that she planned to leave the sport indefinitely. The game she said was no longer bringing her joy. Osaka spoke in the spring of battling depression since winning her first Grand Slam title at the U.S. Open in 2018.

Once more the dark side of the sport a lonely pressure-filled crucible often endured by young talents not ready to handle it had burst into the open.

Then along came Raducanu and Fernandez two bright lights whose lineages span four continents. They delighted crowds with rousing victories and unique styles. After every win Raducanu said she could not believe what had just happened while Fernandez said how strongly she believed she could not lose even if she had no right to think that way as she plowed through one highly ranked player after the next.

Here was something all too rare on the tennis court — unadulterated joy from athletes playing loose and free without any baggage from missed opportunities of the past or the pressure that comes with success and the weight of expectations.

The tired cliché in sports is that it is often a shame that one player has to lose. Given where Raducanu and Fernandez were just two weeks ago as they emerged to captivate the tennis world and millions in their countries and elsewhere who rarely pay attention to the sport it was simply impossible that either of them — or tennis itself — would come away from this experience having not won.

There was a moment late in the match Saturday when the crowd of about 23000 simultaneously chanted “Let’s Go Emma!” and “Let’s Go Leylah!” with some fans alternating names with each round. When does that happen?

They had taken such different routes to reach this stage with Raducanu blazing through her solid but not quite spectacular opponents and Fernandez surviving all those near-death experiences against Osaka and then the three-time Grand Slam champion Angelique Kerber and then Elina Svitolina and Aryna Sabalenka two of the top five players in the world.

Coming into the final Raducanu spoke of treating it like just another match. Fernandez was not shy about talking about the opportunity that was before her. Her father Jorge who is her coach said Saturday that he would talk to his daughter about how this was not just another match.

“It’s a finals all right” Jorge Fernandez said in a teleconference from Florida because he did not accompany his daughter to the tournament preferring that her mother sister and fitness coach attend instead. “Let’s sweat it all out. Let’s make sure that no matter how it finishes there are no regrets because we won’t get another crack at this again if we’re fantastic for another year.”

As it turned out the bigger winner turned out to be Raducanu who got over her early jitters to grab the first lead at 2-0 only to see Fernandez quickly scramble back and knot the set at two games each. From there the match settled into a tense rhythm with long games and long points.

With Fernandez serving at 4-5 Raducanu tightened the vise with two killer crosscourt backhands to secure two set points. Fernandez would save those as well as a third but on the fourth one Raducanu fired a forehand down the line to take her 19th consecutive set.

“I made too many mistakes in the crucial moments” Fernandez said later. “This loss I’m going to carry it for a very long time.”

In the second set Fernandez was wobbly in the first points then surged to a lead then fell back and it looked as if Raducanu was going to roll through but each time Fernandez teetered on the edge she came up with another scorching forehand or stretched for a lob to extend the rally and get Raducanu to make one more untimely error. She would make 25 on the day. It happens when you are 18 and playing in the final of a Grand Slam for the first time and it’s only your second Grand Slam.

But Raducanu broke through in the pivotal sixth game and the only question was whether her teenage nerves would be steely enough to handle the pressure of closing out the tournament.

At first they absolutely were as she raced to get two match points on Fernandez’s serve but the error bug bit her again and on they went to one of the strangest final games a Grand Slam final has ever seen and to a deuce point that left blood dripping down Raducanu’s leg.

It was a moment that might have panicked the most veteran of players or caused one as inexperienced as Raducanu to try to rush to the finish. Two months ago during what looked to everyone like a panic attack she quit in the middle of her fourth round match at Wimbledon telling the trainers she was having trouble breathing.

Instead as Raducanu faced break point on Saturday and a chance for Fernandez to get the set back on serve she took a slow walk to her chair and called for the trainer. There Raducanu got the bandage on her leg absorbed what was unfolding and let it pass. With Fernandez questioning a tournament official about whether the injury really required a stoppage in play Raducanu cooled herself with the air conditioning tube then walked back onto the court a few minutes later ready to meet her moment.

When it was finished Raducanu said something that so many have said before her but no one ever truly believed even those who have said it.

“Every single player in the women’s draw has a shot at winning any tournament” she said.

After Saturday no one could argue with her.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlZGlwbG9tYXQuY29tLzIwMjEvMDkvZWFzaW5nLWNoaW5hLXVzLXRlbnNpb25zLWxlc3NvbnMtZnJvbS1uaXhvbnMtMTk3Mi10cmlwL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Easing China-US Tensions: Lessons From Nixon's 1972 Trip,"Despite hopes for a “reset” under President Joe Biden the chasm between the United States and China has only widened in 2021. Today three-in-four Americans have a negative view of China and anti-China sentiment unites an otherwise divided and partisan body politic. This hostility toward China constrains America’s leadership. Even if Biden wanted to he could not currently enact a policy détente without damaging his agenda and electoral prospects. How then can Biden or a future American president reduce the public’s antipathy and place American foreign policy toward China onto a more sustainable footing?

Former President Richard Nixon’s weeklong 1972 China visit provides one blueprint.

Modern thinkers widely misunderstand the contemporaneous significance of Nixon’s 1972 trip to China. Today many argue that the summit was significant because it produced a communiqué and a common anti-Soviet front. But nobody in 1972 saw the summit this way. Despite modern misunderstandings of the trip’s significance for policymakers in 1972 it was still perceived as historic in its own time. Why was this? Simply put because the images of the U.S. president that were coming out of Beijing were worth more than any communiqué or alliance. They helped to shift American public opinion toward China and helped Americans to start viewing China as more than a security threat creating a political opening for de-escalation later in the decade.

So why is the summit so often misperceived as creating an anti-Soviet front? This misperception stems mainly from the Soviets themselves. After the summit Soviet state media talked darkly about how anti-Sovietism was pushing the United States into the arms of China and the Soviet ambassador was “almost beside himself with protestations of goodwill.” Nixon interpreted this later to show that his trip had brought the Soviets “into a more accommodating state of mind” and to claim that this was one of the original goals of the trip.

However the evidence is mixed at best that Nixon’s trip made the Soviets more amenable to compromise. SALT 1 was not finalized and signed until May 1972 but its key points of contention had already been solved in 1971. Negotiations over Berlin’s links to West Germany had also been essentially concluded by the time Nixon went to Beijing. The most that can be said is that Nixon’s trip alarmed the Soviets but this was not his intention in 1972.

At the time Nixon actually hoped that his trip to Beijing would improve the atmosphere for his upcoming Moscow trip American journalist Robert Kraft told the Soviet ambassador. National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger even tried to arrange for Nixon to travel to Moscow before Beijing and wrote in 1971 that “the PRC… is afraid of giving Moscow a pretext for attack.” But the Soviets themselves were incredulous and dallied on setting a date for a Soviet-U.S. summit. As Kissinger explained to the Chinese the order of Nixon’s summits was thus determined in Moscow; the Americans had no desire to seem provocative.

Nixon even took the initiative after landing in the United States to send a private message to Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev: The United States remained committed to détente and the recent trip to China was not directed against any third country. Further Kissinger took the extraordinary step of holding a private dinner in his home three days after the trip to reassure the Soviet ambassador. It can thus hardly be said that Nixon’s trip to China was intended to create a new de facto Sino-American alliance against Moscow at a time when détente was Nixon’s primary foreign policy priority.

Creating a communiqué or a “one China” policy was also not even on Nixon’s radar when he traveled to Beijing. The Shanghai Communiqué is commonly cited today as the first formal American acknowledgment of its one China policy. But in its own time both the Chinese and the Americans alike viewed the communiqué as insignificant. The New York Times editorial board referred to the communiqué as “an agreement to disagree about a great many things.” During negotiations over wording Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Qiao Guanhua even told the Americans directly that the Chinese did not need a communiqué. Kissinger understood and downplayed the communiqué as well telling the Chinese side that its only purpose was to assuage State Department bureaucrats. Nixon’s chief of staff Bob Haldeman shared Kissinger’s view: “On TV the image of the American President received is worth a million times the effect of a communiqué.”

Nixon also warned the Chinese side: “there is no possibility in the next one and a half years for us to recognize the PRC as the sole government of China in a formal way.” This comment reflects Nixon’s penchant for avoiding commitment coupled with long-term thinking. Nixon’s original intention – and the real reason he went to Beijing – was to begin shifting American public opinion and create the conditions necessary for a better China-U.S. relationship over the long run.

In 1972 Nixon did not have explicit goals such as creating a “one China” policy or an anti-Soviet alliance. As he told Mao:

Too often we look at problems of the world from the point of view of tactics. We take the short view … It is essential to look at the world not just in terms of immediate diplomatic battles and decisions but the great forces that move the world. Maybe we have some disagreements but we know there will be changes and we know that there can be a better and I trust safer world for our two peoples.

This also comports with off-the-cuff 5 a.m. remarks that Nixon made to anti-war protesters during one of his notorious late-night episodes. In those remarks he encouraged the protesters to travel and said that his great hope was for “the great mainland of China to be opened up so that we could know the 700 million people who live in China and are one of the most remarkable people on earth.”

So what lessons can we draw from Nixon’s trip that might help to thaw China-U.S. relations today? First Nixon was willing to take a great political gamble in trying to appeal to the American people’s emotional ethos. As he recalled: “Congressman John Schmitz of California charged me with ‘surrendering to international Communism’ by accepting the invitation. George Wallace… told reporters that he suspected the trip was actually a diversionary tactic to get people’s minds off ‘inflation and the high cost of pork chops’ …” Even those supportive of Nixon’s trip mostly Democrats the president wrote “temper[ed] their praise with speculation that my motives had been political.” To improve relations with China today may require an equally bold move and a willingness to sacrifice popularity for a safer world.

Second Nixon – despite his reputation as emotionally disconnected to those closest to him – fundamentally understood the collective emotional ethos of the American people. As he told Kissinger: “It really was a question of the American people being hopelessly and naively for peace.” As American involvement in Afghanistan ends the question remains: Is the same true today?

Nixon also instinctively understood the importance of images in shifting public opinion. His recollection of the “most moving” moment from the summit highlights this: “The transcript of the conversation [with Mao] may not have caught probably the most moving moment when [Mao] reached out his hand and I reached out mine and he held it for about a minute.”

Nixon partly understood the role of images in shaping emotion through his own racialized view of the world as is clear from his February 1972 comments – shocking in their bluntness – on the U.S. withdrawal from Vietnam:

From a political standpoint we should have flushed them [the South Vietnamese] down the drain three years ago. … Sure the North Vietnamese would’ve slaughtered and castrated two million South Vietnamese Catholics but nobody [in the U.S.] would have cared. These little brown people so far away we don’t know them very well naturally you would say.

Perhaps not despite his flaws but because of them Nixon understood the importance of familiarity and “understanding” between peoples as well as any modern politician. On his China trip he was attempting to build the sort of “understanding” of the Chinese people that he instinctively knew was required to win public support for a better relationship.

Nixon also understood the power of images from his own life. Television images played an important role in his first failed presidential bid in 1960 and afterward Nixon became obsessed with the new medium. He thus made staged photo-ops a priority in China. As John Chancellor of NBC News put it the trip was “a theatrical accomplishment of the first magnitude for its producers the American and Chinese governments.” He added: “Who needs circuses when you’ve got China?” Nixon even conscripted his wife Pat to use as a – in his own words – “prop” for when he would have to sneak away from the press for official business. Any modern politician must like Nixon understand the value of images as well as communiqués agreements and speeches.

In conclusion it’s difficult to understate the impact of Nixon’s trip on American public opinion about China. In 1968 Pew had surveyed Americans about “the Chinese people;” most held them in low regard. (Less than 0.5 percent of Americans for example thought Chinese were “honest.”) But in 1972 after Nixon’s trip Americans were well on their way to having positive opinions of the ordinary Chinese.

As tensions rise between the United States and China today how can we put relations back on a more positive footing? Nixon’s “week that changed the world” might offer one possible answer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBjbWFnLmNvbS9uZXdzLzI1LXllYXJzLWFnby1kcmFnb24tYmFsbC16LWhpdC1hbWVyaWNhbi10di1mb3ItdGhlLWZpcnN0LXRpbWXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,25 Years Ago Dragon Ball Z Hit American TV for the First Time,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.pcmag.com/news/25-years-ago-dragon-ball-z-hit-american-tv-for-the-first-time on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBjbWFnLmNvbS9uZXdzLzI1LXllYXJzLWFnby1kcmFnb24tYmFsbC16LWhpdC1hbWVyaWNhbi10di1mb3ItdGhlLWZpcnN0LXRpbWXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Special to the Sentinel

It is an absolutely spectacular late-summer morning in New York City. Erased is yesterday’s oppressive humidity replaced by crisp cool air and a gentle breeze. I’m in a cab on my way to a 9 a.m. meeting at American Express in the World Financial Center across the street from the massive twin towers of the World Trade Center. My taxi has whisked me from my hotel in midtown down to lower Manhattan. I’m earlier than I thought I’d be.

As I sit waiting for the light to change 1½ blocks from the World Trade Center a muffled explosion is followed by a shower of breaking glass and debris falling onto the street around us. Something big crashes down knocking over a lamppost on the curb near the cab. A small explosion must have broken a window a few floors up I think. The driver in true-to-form New York cabbie style harrumphs at the inconvenience and tells me I’d be better off getting out now. Neither one of us has a clue about what has just happened a quarter-mile over our heads.

As I pay him I lean to the window and look up at the World Trade Center towers. To my horror the top 15-20 floors of the north tower are on fire already burning furiously. Flames blast out through the windows and plumes of smoke stream skyward while thousands of bits of paper flutter slowly toward the ground.

I quickly scramble out of the cab and dart across three lanes to the curb. As I cross the street I look up in the roadway and see what appears to be a headless torso lying puzzlingly in the street. It’s like someone has just dropped part of a store window mannequin right there. I look again. It is a person’s torso. I struggle to make sense of what I am witnessing.

Most people are just milling around watching in shock as the building burns not knowing quite what else to do. People point to the fire exchange questions and try in vain to digest the enormity of what they are seeing. It seems to take many minutes before the sirens of fire and rescue trucks forewarn their arrival. I struggle to focus on what to do next. Do I cross the street which might make it harder for me to move to safety or do I stay where I am? I cannot go north. I am trapped at the very foot of Manhattan.

Out of nowhere the screaming of jet engines overhead drowns out all sound. I look up to see what is unmistakably a United Airlines 767 straining to bank sharply. A thunderous explosion rips through the air around me sending a panic through the crowd and scattering people in all directions. I find shelter under a scaffolding. Surprisingly nothing falls on me so I start walking briskly down the street away from danger. I’m overcome with the empty feeling of being very alone in this mess though surrounded by hundreds of others also alone on their own worst day. We all head instinctively toward the only open space in lower Manhattan – Battery Park.

I now have a clear view of both towers engulfed in flames. The north tower is burning out of control. The south tower has a huge gaping hole the shape of the end-on view of the jet that has pierced it. Objects fall from the north tower. It turns out they are bodies. Bodies that are jumping not falling out of the windows. How awful must it be inside the building for people to decide to jump to certain death below?

The air in Battery Park is abuzz with nervous energy of thousands of people. Sobbing and anxiety are intermixed with disbelief and horror. Most people fruitlessly dial cell phones desperately trying to contact friends or loved ones. Almost no one is successful. I plop down on a bench to rest. There I meet two women who had been staying at the Marriott World Trade Center which literally straddles the base between the two towers. One woman is agitated and certain this is an attack on dignitaries attending her meeting. The other woman heard the first crash and had seen bodies falling outside her hotel room window. She immediately pulled on her jeans grabbed her computer and purse and ran down the six flights of stairs to the ground floor and outside. Her quick decisions and sense of imminent danger saved her.

The three of us stay together in Battery Park. This hellish scene is nowhere to be alone. We come across a couple of guys with a portable TV. There we learn that the Pentagon has also been hit and that other commercial airliners are missing. This is bad really bad. What could be next we wonder incredulously? I expect to see fighter jets scream across the sky. It’s a scene from a bad action movie but is real. Who is attacking us? Is this it? Will anyone protect us?

At about 10:25 a.m. this already surreal panorama becomes even more bizarre. With a thundering rumble the top of the south tower begins to crumble and collapse before our eyes. People scream helplessly and try to run away but there is only water behind us. I am terrified that the surging crowd will push me over the edge into the water. The immense cloud of dust and ash boils up hundreds of feet in the air and races toward us like a massive tsunami.

Day turns to night. The dust cloud hangs thick in the air like Tule fog. We can only see 20 feet or so. Our trio starts moving to the east on our quest to escape to safety. Dust is everywhere coating everything. I breathe through the lapel on my suit jacket trying to filter out a little bit of clean air.

A mob of people surges toward the Staten Island ferry terminal looking for the quickest way to escape this nightmare. The loud crack of a car backfiring spooks them like wild horses. I am petrified. The crowd bolts suddenly in the opposite direction. I’m jostled to the ground. I yell out frantically. It is as if no sound comes out of my mouth. Fear has a stranglehold on everyone. Most of all I’m afraid of not knowing what will happen next.

We huddle by a chain-link fence at the base of a small Coast Guard building next to the ferry terminal. Everyone squats low to the ground to catch the last breaths of cleaner air. A fine powdery dust drizzles down on us.

The air is thick with snowflake-size ash. Without a thought a linen supply deliveryman begins throwing out towels from his truck to the crush of people around him. Now we all breathe a little less tentatively.

The dust-filled twilight finally begins to give way. Sunlight filters down as the clouds of choking ash subside. My eyes follow the rays of light upward and to my amazement the first thing I see is the American flag high above Battery Park unscathed and fluttering in the light breeze.

We start our walk out of the danger zone. The dust burns my eyes the back of my throat is raspy. I clear my throat and spit out as much of the acrid dust as possible. I take the towel away from my mouth and nose and wipe the gritty film from my glasses. I look down at my formerly black suit turned gray by concrete dust. My shoes have a thick coating of gray dust. My face is caked with grime and sweat and my hair is stiff. We walk a few more blocks and suddenly the dust in the air gets noticeably thicker again. We later find out this is the aftermath of the North Tower collapsing. It isn’t until I see television coverage later that I realize both towers have been completely destroyed. Unimaginable.

Our exodus takes us through several anonymous Manhattan neighborhoods. Our priority now switches from survival to finding a way to communicate with loved ones. I continuously push the redial button my cell phone trying to reach my family. Each time it is the same result a fast busy signal. Not even the pay phones on the street are working. We are cut off from the outside world. A few blocks further on we finally find a pay phone that is working intermittently at a small neighborhood grocery store.

A fellow refugee ahead of us in line for the pay phone gets lucky. He generously takes the next-of-kin phone numbers of everyone else in the line. In an automatic unselfish gesture this stranger from New Jersey calls my wife to let her know “I will be OK.” It isn’t until a half-hour later I finally get through on my cell phone to my family. Only then do I recognize the terror they have been living for the past three hours 3000 miles away — hoping for the best but imagining the worst.

I cannot make sense of what I’ve just been through. Bewildered confused and angry I sit in my hotel room glued in disbelief to the TV news coverage for the next day and a half. I finally realize I am truly lucky to be alive. Luckier than many that day. My life will forever be scarred by the events of Sept. 11 2001. Life’s priorities are clearer now. Family time is more precious. And the sound of a jet passing low overhead will never be the same.

Ten years after authorities finish deconstructing the 9/11-damaged Deutsche Bank Building the southern part of its footprint remains undeveloped in 2021 as plans for the construction of a future Five World Trade Center tower await approval from several governmental agencies. The Lower Manhattan Development Corporation retains ownership of the land parcel known as site 5 which is bounded by Washington Albany and Greenwich streets.

After the National September 11 Memorial plaza opens to the public in September 2011 LMDC allows the southern portion of site 5 to be used as a waiting area for ticketed visitors to the plaza which is surrounded by a fence. The site 5 waiting area is vacated on May 15 2014 when a dedication ceremony is held for the National September 11 Museum and the Memorial plaza’s fence is removed giving visitors free access to the plaza for the first time.

LMDC decides to develop the vacated southern portion of site 5 into a temporary park as part of a project with Downtown Alliance a nonprofit group that advocates for Lower Manhattan businesses. The park opens to the public on September 2 2014. Named Albany Street Plaza it features benches trees and a colorful mural on a wall separating it from a police command post.

LMDC allows the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to builds trailers on the northern portion of site 5 in 2014. The trailers contain office space for the Port Authority Police’s World Trade Center Command which moves into the temporary facility on April 24 of that year.

In a major step toward realizing the vision of a 5 WTC tower New York Governor Andrew Cuomo LMDC and the Port Authority issue a request for proposals on June 26 2019 seeking plans from developers to either lease or purchase the site for the construction of a commercial or mixed-use building.

LMDC and the Port Authority decide on February 11 2021 to enter into exclusive negotiations with a consortium of developers that proposes to lease the site and build a largely residential tower. The 99-year lease would require the developers to pay rent directly to the Port Authority.

The consortium is led by U.S. firm Silverstein Properties and Canadian-owned firm Brookfield Properties and includes two smaller New York-based firms Omni New York and Dabar Development Partners.

The Port Authority tells VOA that negotiations with the consortium on finalizing the lease for a future 5 WTC continue through August with no word on when they are likely to conclude.

New Saint Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church & National Shrine

Almost 20 years after the original church is destroyed on 9/11 construction of a new Saint Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church and National Shrine nears completion at a nearby site in August 2021. It is designed by Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava whom the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America first commissioned to draw up plans for the new building in 2012.

Credit: Vladimir Badikov VOA

Calatrava’s design released in 2013 envisions a domed white marble building surrounded by four pillars modeled on Istanbul’s Hagia Sophia and Church of the Holy Savior in Chora two iconic former Greek Orthodox churches later converted into mosques by Turkish authorities in 2020. Located at 130 Liberty Street on the eastern side of the World Trade Center’s new Liberty Park construction of the estimated $20 million project begins with a ground-breaking ceremony on October 18 2014 and reaches a “topping out” stage with a temporary cross placed on the building’s skeletal dome on November 29 2016.

The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey which agreed to let the archdiocese rebuild the church at 130 Liberty Street as part of a 2011 land swap agreement signs another deal on August 21 2017 to lease the site to the archdiocese for 198 years. The new agreement sets the rent for the church-shrine at a nominal $1 per year and gives the archdiocese the option to buy the site at any time during the lease also for a nominal fee. The archdiocese agrees to let the Port Authority maintain ownership of the site so that the governmental agency retains responsibility for securing permits and regulatory approvals during the construction process.

But building work stops in December 2017 when Swedish construction company Skanska says the archdiocese is not paying it. The archdiocese reveals months earlier that it is in a severe financial deficit that has been building for years and hires PricewaterhouseCoopers in April 2018 to investigate the church-shrine project’s finances and major cost overruns.

The investigators conclude in October 2018 that there is no evidence of fraud or improper usage of funds by archdiocese members. The archdiocese also accepts the investigators’ call for the creation of a new independent entity “Friends of Saint Nicholas” to raise funds to complete the stalled project.

The Friends of Saint Nicholas group raises millions of additional dollars from private donations enabling construction to resume on August 3 2020. Total raised funds reach $95 million in June 2021 almost five times the original projected cost of the rebuilding.

In a statement to VOA the archdiocese says the church-shrine’s exterior is expected to be completed by the evening of September 10 2021 when it will be illuminated from the inside for the first time.

With everyday credit cards now charging hundreds of dollars in annual fees don’t be fooled into thinking you already have a prestigious card. The ultra-wealthy super-elite and celebrities don’t settle for something on the mass market. Instead they hold out for cards you’ve never heard of: accounts veiled by secrecy. Their unattainability offers an extra allure.

Prestige is just the beginning. These high-end exclusive cards often come with specialized concierge services that cater to your every whim. Individual account managers bend over backwards to fulfill requests and create a bespoke customer experience. Plus lavish perks and luxury gifts aren’t unheard of nor are credit limits in the six figures.

As you might expect having a solid credit score and healthy checking account won’t be enough to obtain one of these cards. The most exclusive credit cards are invitation only a gateway precisely designed to keep things reserved for a select few. Applicants may be hand chosen based on strong existing relationships with the card issuer. It’s likely their spending habits are at levels the average American only dreams of.

Are these exclusive credit cards simply a status symbol or lucrative opportunity? That’s up to you to decide.

Centurion Card from American Express

Better known as the “black card” the Centurion card’s prestige is partly due to the mystery behind it. Exact criteria to receive an invitation isn’t published though if you’re an existing Amex cardholder with high spending you can request an invitation online. What we do know is that the $5000 annual fee comes with elite travel statuses and memberships to luxury outlets along with unsurpassed personal service.

With this card and some others on our list the perks available to you aren’t publicly disclosed. But we know the card comes with an Equinox All Access Gym membership (valued at $3120 annually) a $1000 annual Saks Fifth Avenue credit and numerous travel benefits like airport lounge access including dedicated seating at Centurion Clubs and VIP airport arrival services at 32 major airports.

This card also earns you top status on Delta Hertz and Hilton

J.P. Morgan Reserve Card

Other than the J.P. Morgan branding on this card and the extra heft from its palladium composition this product is suspiciously similar to the publicly-available Chase Sapphire Reserve. That makes this invitation-only card one that you get primarily as an immediate signal of your status rather than one you covet for the perks. After all sometimes playing hard to get is half the draw.

With this card you’ll earn bonus rewards on Peloton equipment purchases or a $120 rebate on a Peloton Digital Membership. You’ll also receive a $300 annual travel credit and unlimited restaurant deliveries through DoorDash with a $0 delivery fee and reduced service fees on eligible orders over $12.

Coutts Silk Card

In Coutts’ own words the Silk charge card “opens doors to a world of privileges and benefits” through its signature loyalty program and exclusive network of global concierges. Unlike other cards this U.K. card is less focused on hand-selecting applicants and more about serving high wealth clients.

How wealthy is wealthy enough? Gossip on the street suggests you’ll need to have at least 1 million pounds in a Coutts account making this a more attainable option.

Dubai First Royale Mastercard

Like the city of Dubai itself there’s nothing understated about the ultra-exclusive Dubai First Royale Mastercard. Diamond-studded and trimmed in gold the physical card is extravagant. and the intrinsic benefits are even more droolworthy.

It’s also invitation-only and reserved for some of the world’s wealthiest individuals. Rumored to be held by royal families and billionaires it’s safe to say that if you have to ask how to get the card you’re not in the right circles yet.

MasterCard Gold Card

Plated in real 24K gold the MasterCard Gold Card lives up to its name. While the card offers a number of travel benefits similar to premium cards available on the mass market it stands out for its comprehensive concierge services. Whether you’re looking to skip the line get behind-the-scenes access or deal with a crisis there’s someone ready to assist you 24/7. It’ll cost you $995 per year but no invitation is needed to apply.

For the cost we think a still-premium but lower-annual-fee card provides a better value proposition—if you’re willing to give up the 24K gold.

Other Exclusive Cards

There are other exclusive cards available cards so exclusive that you’ll only find out about them if your private banker calls you directly. If that happens listen carefully. While not all cards will have over-the-top designs with gold and gemstones you can bet they’ll be prestigious offers that convey status immediately. More importantly if you’re one of the lucky few you’ll have access to unparalleled service that’ll leave you wondering how you ever survived without one.

Others have faces printed on t-shirts. All line up patiently filing into the World Trade Center memorial to pay tribute to loved ones killed during the terror attacks.

Some like Yvette Thomas-Huang come every year. Her sister Bridget Ann Esposito worked for American Express on the 94th floor of the north tower.

“She was the best sister ever the best person. She was wonderful” Thomas-Huang said.

“I wish she could have seen her nieces grow up. I wish I could grow old with her” she added.



They come to celebrate how they lived and remember how they died.



“They call him the elevator man” said MaryKate Naples whose father Chuck Costello died on September 11. “He was working 20 blocks away. He ran here. He ran into the first building. He was actually recovered in the second tower. That’s how we know he got into both.”



Naples said it was important to visit the site today in memory of her dad.



“I haven’t been here in 10 years for the memorial. But I have kids. This is my stepdaughter. I have a baby at home. It’s really important they know who their grandfather was and what he did” Naples said.



Others like Diane Pryor-Holland are mourning deaths that are more recent. Her husband transit police officer Richard Holland died from a 9/11-related cancer in 2012.



“The post-9/11 are dying really rapidly” Pryor-Holland said. “The numbers are rising and it’s really frightening. This is a sad occasion.""

Shortly after al-Qaida terrorists attacked the Twin Towers and the Pentagon many Muslims as well as other Arab Americans became the targets of anger and racism.

Mosques were burned or destroyed and death threats and harassment followed many Muslims in the weeks following the attacks according to congressional testimony from the Southern Poverty Law Center in 2011. Some victims were beaten attacked or held at gunpoint for merely being perceived as Muslim the organization said.

Rep. Ilhan Omar D-Minn. who is Muslim reflected on 9/11 and the discrimination that followed in an interview with ABC News. ""As Americans as people who are living here we were also attacked"" she said. ""This is our community this is our country and there were Muslims who lost their lives in those towers who were Muslim firefighters who lost their lives.""

She added ""There is a desire by many to use our faith and our identity as a weapon against us and to 'other' us. That has been really harmful in so many ways.""

Hate crimes against Muslims rose 1617% from 2000 to 2001 according to the FBI marking some of the highest numbers of Islamophobic hate crimes ever in the U.S.

But even as the country moved further from the attacks and the Muslim American population in the country grew discrimination against this community has not waned Pew Research Center reports.

After the 9/11 attacks

On Sept. 17 2001 then-President George W. Bush spoke at the Islamic Center of Washington D.C. to denounce hatred against Muslims amid his vows to ""win the war against terrorism"" in the Middle East.

""​​The face of terror is not the true faith of Islam"" Bush said. ""That's not what Islam is all about. Islam is peace. These terrorists don't represent peace. They represent evil and war.""

And for the most part the public agreed with the president -- the Pew Research Center found that 59% of people had favorable views of Muslim-Americans following the attacks although 40% of the public believe that the terrorists were motivated at least in part by religion.

However those who didn't view Muslims favorably went on the offense. Across the country reports of bomb threats arson and assaults against Muslims made headlines.

""In the post-9/11 period there was a lot of fear about Muslims and terrorism in the United States and so we created all these new opportunities to surveil citizens and harass citizens and even entrap citizens in our desire to fight terrorism"" said Sally Howell director of the Center for Arab American Studies at the University of Michigan-Dearborn.

As years passed the number of hate crimes dropped (and then rose again in recent years) according to the FBI but the damage was done. For years Muslims in the United States felt unsure about their place in American society according to the research initiative by the University of California Berkeley called Islamophobia Research and Documentation Project.

""This for me is one of the saddest pieces in the survey -- we asked people as a Muslim living in the West if 'I feel more strongly insecure and afraid for my family and kids'"" Hatem Bazian a lecturer at the University of California Berkeley and leader of the college's Islamophobia Research and Documentation Project.

A small group attend an ""anti-Islam"" rally organized by ""ACT for America"" known for its racist and anti-Islamic notions in Foley Square in Manhattan New York June 10 2017. Meanwhile another group more crowded and consisting anti-Trump and Muslim supporters staged a simultaneous protest to condemn the ""anti-Islam"" rally. Anadolu Agency via Getty Images FILE

He said that of the people surveyed almost 80% said they feel at least somewhat worried about the safety of their family in the U.S.

And each election cycle that uncertainty about their role in American society was exacerbated. Islamophobia became a political tool with some public figures like former President Donald Trump and media commentators using the fear against Muslims and Arab Americans to rile up their bases.

Islamophobia as a political tool

Anti-Muslim rhetoric was used against former President Barack Obama during both of his presidential campaigns despite the fact that Obama is a Christian. Racist and xenophobic rumors about his religion and about his birthplace were used to stoke outrage and mistrust against Obama weaponizing pre-existing fear about Muslims.

Opponents doubled down on conspiracy theories about Obama concerning his nationality and religion -- falsely claiming that he was ineligible to become the president because he was not born in the U.S. or that he secretly practiced Islam which would not make him ineligible for the presidency.

""Islamophobia was monetized into votes at the ballot box by projecting Obama as a closet Muslim"" Bazian said.

Anti-Muslim sentiment continued during the 2016 election cycle during which Islamophobic hate crimes surged again.

According to the FBI there were 481 incidents in 2001 followed by a significant decline in incidents the next year -- 155.

In 2015 there were 257 hate crimes against Muslims and 307 in 2016. The number of incidents has declined since then through 2019 the latest year for which data is available.

Experts link the rise in hate to the anti-Muslim rhetoric being espoused on the political stage. then-candidate Trump made the Islamic faith and Muslims targets of criticism throughout his presidential campaign including proposing a ban on Muslims entering the country.

In November 2015 he made unsubstantiated claims on ABC News that Arab Americans were celebrating the fall of the Twin Towers: ""There were people over in New Jersey that were watching it a heavy Arab population that were cheering as the buildings came down. Not good.""

In March 2016 Trump claimed on CNN that hatred defined the Islam faith saying ""I think Islam hates us. There's something there that — there's a tremendous hatred there. There's a tremendous hatred. We have to get to the bottom of it. There's an unbelievable hatred of us.""

During the first months of the Trump administration the Pew Research Center reported that roughly 75% of Muslim American adults said there is a lot of discrimination against Muslims in the U.S.

Shortly into his time in office Trump signed an executive order that barred immigrants from several Muslim-majority countries in a move that critics say enshrined his anti-Muslim stance into law. While he was a presidential candidate he called for a complete ban on Muslims entering the United States.

The measure was legally challenged until the Supreme Court upheld an amended version of the order in 2018. It affected travelers and immigrants from Muslim-majority countries like Iran Somalia Yemen Syria and Libya.

It also included North Koreans and some Venezuelans and other nations were added to the list in 2020.

From 2017 to 2021 when Biden ended the ban more than 40000 people were refused visas because of the executive order according to U.S. State Department figures.

Trump and supporters of the order denied that it was Islamophobic saying instead that it was protecting the U.S. from terrorism. But advocates say that the order which is no longer in effect legitimized hatred and fear of Muslims making life and immigration to the U.S. much harder.

""It takes a long time to undo the effects of these types of messages and these types of campaigns"" Bazian said. ""Islamophobia is not really about Muslims. It uses Muslims but it's not about Muslims. It's about the rallying the discomfort of certain pockets of Western society at a time of unsureness.""

Now Muslim communities across the country are focused on building safe communities and curbing Islamophobia with education and outreach following years of anti-Muslim rhetoric in the White House.

Building community and combatting discrimination

Despite efforts by some groups to quell this population Muslims have continued to grow and thrive in the U.S.

Muslims have slowly gained representation in the government in U.S. television and a presence in the public sphere across the country.

""If you look at the Detroit area and the contributions that immigrants from the Muslim world are making to society and the economy -- they're just the bedrock and backbone of so many local industries"" Howell said.

In 2007 the first Muslim member of Congress Rep. Keith Ellison D-Minn. was elected. In 2018 voters elected the first Muslim women to hold a seat in Congress: Democratic Reps. Omar and Rashida Tlaib.

In an interview Tlaib told ABC News that her Muslim faith and background helps her understand the harm that can come from Islamophobia and xenophobia.

""We can be there to talk about it and say 'no it didn't work 20 years ago it's not going to work now. And you're actually making us less safe in your and you're also enabling hate and racism in our country when you target people solely based on their faith'"" Tlaib said. ""I think that's why were so strongly in opposition of the ban on people of Muslim faith into our country and so much more.""

The Muslim population in the U.S. continues to rise and is projected to have grown to 3.85 million people in 2020 according to the Pew Research Center. And as more Muslims continue to cultivate communities across the country more houses of worship in the U.S. have appeared over the last 20 years as well.

The Cooperative Congregational Studies Partnership found 1209 mosques in the U.S. in 2000 -- and that number more than doubled in 2020 when researchers found at least 2769 mosques.

Islam has been seen in the Western world in a negative light according to Bazian who believes this negative portrayal couldn't be further from the truth. He says education is the first step to ridding the faith and its people of this stigma.

""They created this fear that America is being taken over by Muslims"" Bazian said recommending training to teachers human resources and the workplace. ""We have been playing ignorant for some time so education is still one of the primary tools to counter Islamophobia.""

Most Americans don't know a Muslim or admit to not knowing anything about Muslims according to a Pew Research Center survey.

""The public has fairly limited sort of direct knowledge or interaction with Muslims"" said Dr. Besheer Mohamed a senior researcher at Pew Research Center. ""People who say they personally know someone who's Muslim then they have more positive views toward Islam and toward Muslims than people who don't.""

This invisibility Howell said is what is giving Islamophobia its power.

""It's important that we understand that because we need to know that Muslims are not outsiders they're not strangers"" Howell said. ""When Muslims are visible to non-Muslims through their institutions through their names through their headscarves through the Halal signs on their restaurants then people would know their co-workers their neighbors as Muslims and this helps overcome whatever you know prejudice or concern they might have.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiKWh0dHBzOi8vcHJvamVjdHMudm9hbmV3cy5jb20vZ3JvdW5kLXplcm8v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ground Zero - Then and Now | VOA Special Projects,"Undeveloped land parcel reserved for future 5 WTC

Ten years after authorities finish deconstructing the 9/11-damaged Deutsche Bank Building the southern part of its footprint remains undeveloped in 2021 as plans for the construction of a future Five World Trade Center tower await approval from several governmental agencies. The Lower Manhattan Development Corporation retains ownership of the land parcel known as site 5 which is bounded by Washington Albany and Greenwich streets.

After the National September 11 Memorial plaza opens to the public in September 2011 LMDC allows the southern portion of site 5 to be used as a waiting area for ticketed visitors to the plaza which is surrounded by a fence. The site 5 waiting area is vacated on May 15 2014 when a dedication ceremony is held for the National September 11 Museum and the Memorial plaza’s fence is removed giving visitors free access to the plaza for the first time.

LMDC allows the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to builds trailers on the northern portion of site 5 in 2014. The trailers contain office space for the Port Authority Police’s World Trade Center Command which moves into the temporary facility on April 24 of that year.

In a major step toward realizing the vision of a 5 WTC tower New York Governor Andrew Cuomo LMDC and the Port Authority issue a request for proposals on June 26 2019 seeking plans from developers to either lease or purchase the site for the construction of a commercial or mixed-use building.

LMDC and the Port Authority decide on February 11 2021 to enter into exclusive negotiations with a consortium of developers that proposes to lease the site and build a largely residential tower. The 99-year lease would require the developers to pay rent directly to the Port Authority.

The consortium is led by U.S. firm Silverstein Properties and Canadian-owned firm Brookfield Properties and includes two smaller New York-based firms Omni New York and Dabar Development Partners.

The Port Authority tells VOA that negotiations with the consortium on finalizing the lease for a future 5 WTC continue through August with no word on when they are likely to conclude.

The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey which agreed to let the archdiocese rebuild the church at 130 Liberty Street as part of a 2011 land swap agreement signs another deal on August 21 2017 to lease the site to the archdiocese for 198 years. The new agreement sets the rent for the church-shrine at a nominal $1 per year and gives the archdiocese the option to buy the site at any time during the lease also for a nominal fee. The archdiocese agrees to let the Port Authority maintain ownership of the site so that the governmental agency retains responsibility for securing permits and regulatory approvals during the construction process.

But building work stops in December 2017 when Swedish construction company Skanska says the archdiocese is not paying it. The archdiocese reveals months earlier that it is in a severe financial deficit that has been building for years and hires PricewaterhouseCoopers in April 2018 to investigate the church-shrine project’s finances and major cost overruns.

The investigators conclude in October 2018 that there is no evidence of fraud or improper usage of funds by archdiocese members. The archdiocese also accepts the investigators’ call for the creation of a new independent entity “Friends of Saint Nicholas” to raise funds to complete the stalled project.

The Friends of Saint Nicholas group raises millions of additional dollars from private donations enabling construction to resume on August 3 2020. Total raised funds reach $95 million in June 2021 almost five times the original projected cost of the rebuilding.

In a statement to VOA the archdiocese says the church-shrine’s exterior is expected to be completed by the evening of September 10 2021 when it will be illuminated from the inside for the first time.

As the country aims to move away from their approach to economic policy Chilean author and journalist Daniel Matamala discusses the controversial legacy of the Chicago Boys.

Editor’s note: The current debate in economics seems to lack a historical perspective. To try to address this deficiency we decided to launch a Sunday column on ProMarket focusing on the historical dimension of economic ideas. You can read all of the pieces in the series here.

When you say “Chicago” almost anywhere in the world it could bring to mind any number of associations: Michael Jordan the Cubs Al Capone Willis Tower. If you are in Chile though you will likely get a different knee-jerk reaction: Chicago? Sure the Chicago Boys! The influence of a generation of economists trained at the University of Chicago under Milton Friedman and Arnold Harberger is so pervasive that not even Michael Jordan and the entire Bulls roster could eclipse them.

Under Augusto Pinochet’s dictatorial regime in the 1970s and 80s the Chicago Boys conducted the farthest-reaching economic revolution in the history of Chile. Their pro-business policies have had an overwhelming impact that can be seen today in nearly every area of social life: education health care the pension system and more.

The Chicago Boys’ legacy is a controversial issue in Chile. On the one hand Chile’s economic growth has been exceptional: its GDP leaped from $14 billion in 1977 to $247 billion in 2017. On the other hand the country’s economic inequality is astonishing: 28.1 percent of the total income is concentrated among 1 percent of the population making Chile one of the world’s most unequal nations.

While the Chicago Boys’ policies did open some economic areas to real competition they also concentrated capital among a small group of well-connected magnates. Since their implementation powerful corporate groups born under Pinochet’s regime have used these pro-market ideas to avoid competition.

When in October of 2019 more than a million Chileans poured into the streets to protest inequality and the privileges of the elite the critique of the Chicago Boys resonated loudly. “Chao Chicago” (“Bye Chicago”) said a typical graffiti message. “Chile was the cradle of neoliberalism and Chile will be its grave” was one of the protesters’ chants.

Two years later Chile has elected a Constitutional Convention tasked with designing a new foundational document to replace the one enacted by Pinochet one whose critics—including the Convention’s overwhelming majority—deem “neoliberal.” Convention President Elisa Loncon said that the new Constitution should establish “an economic model that brings justice instead of a neoliberal model”.

The left-wing presidential primaries in July this year were won by Gabriel Boric a 35-year-old ex-student leader. In his victory speech Boric repeated the slogan of the 2019 protests: “If Chile was neoliberalism’s cradle it will also be its grave.”

But who were the Chicago Boys? And how did they manage to turn Chile into the cradle of a social experiment that today many want to bury?

Project Chile

Until 1973 economic theory and practice in Chile—as in much of Latin America—was dominated by ideas promoted by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC): a strong state protectionism and “inward” development prioritizing industrialization as the way to emerge from underdevelopment. These were not just left-wing ideas; political parties on the right and some in the business sector also supported them.

Amid the ongoing Cold War the advancement of these ideas was considered a threat by US politicians. In his 1961 book The Voice Of Latin America then Democratic Senator from Connecticut William Benton wrote that “a grave problem in Chile has been posed by the Marxist left-wing-oriented economists who have come from the university economics departments and who have infiltrated into the Chilean government and economy.” According to US Ambassador to Chile (1953-1956) Willard L. Beaulac the University of Chile’s College of Economics—which was the nation’s most important economics school during those years—was “a communist nest.”

According to Chilean historian Manuel Gárate author of La Revolución Capitalista de Chile (“The Capitalist Revolution of Chile” 2012) the US government tried to “combat and counteract what was perceived as a ‘socialist way of thinking’ in Chile’s economics education”. Albion Patterson a close ally of Senator Benton’s and a representative of the US government’s International Cooperation Administration (ICA) a government agency that provided non-military assistance sponsored an agreement between the University of Chicago and the Pontificate Catholic University of Chile (PUC) the bastion of Chile’s conservative elite. The agreement signed in 1955 enabled the exchange of professors and post-graduate fellows. As part of this “Chile Project” 26 Chilean students were educated at the University of Chicago between 1956 and 1964 with University of Chicago economist Arnold Harberger as their academic and personal guide.

Upon their return this group took over the PUC School of Economics. The Chileans came back with “a sense of mission the mission of the economist who as the new philosopher transmits science and modernism to society” writes Juan Gabriel Valdés Chile’s former Minister of Foreign Affairs (1999-2000) and the author of the deepest investigation into the Chicago Boys Pinochet’s Economists: The Chicago School of Economics in Chile (1995). Almost all the “Chicago Boys” supported right-wing policies and parties and worked in right-wing governments but they saw themselves as scientists far removed from ideology. Dominique Hachette ex-director of the PUC’s School of Economics recalled in “La Escuela de Chicago” by Francisco Rosende that “I received good scientific positivist training not an ideology designed by the ‘Great Satan.’” Rolf Lüders Pinochet’s former Treasury and Economics minister from 1982 to 1983 said that The University of Chicago conceives of the economy “not as an instrument to justify one ideology or another” but rather to observe reality in a way that was “positivist and empirical.

This program was supported by business and political groups who saw it as an antidote to the expansion of socialism. The Chicago Boys were assembled in the Center for Socio-Economic Studies (Cesac) a think tank financed by Agustín Edwards the owner of one of the largest economic groups of the time director of the influential right-wing newspaper El Mercurio and a CIA collaborator.

When the Marxist candidate Salvador Allende won Chile’s 1970 presidential elections the Chicago Boys felt their work to be even more urgent. While business and military groups conspired to overthrow Allende the Chicago Boys prepared a government plan called “The Brick” which later served as the economic base for the dictatorship.

In 1973 a military coup overthrew Allende who committed suicide in the presidential palace. A military “junta” led by General Augusto Pinochet controlled the country since then and until the restoration of civil rule in 1990. According to Lüders “A social-economic program like the one put forward in ‘The Brick’ was a necessary pre-condition for the military coup.”

After Allende’s overthrow and suicide Pinochet’s dictatorship put the Chicago Boys in charge of its economic team granting them broad powers to put the Brick’s ideas into practice. It was not a purely ideological decision: Pinochet leaned heavily on the business conglomerates BHC and Cruzat-Larraín which were linked to the Chicago Boys and would benefit from an abrupt liberalization of the economy like the one that was about to occur. These groups were based in the financial and export sectors unlike the traditional groups centered on industry and “inward” development.

The leader of the Chicago Boys Sergio de Castro was named Economic Minister in 1975 and his associates filled the main positions of power within the dictatorship’s economic team. “They all had personal and/or business ties with the BHC or Cruzat groups” said Political Science professor Eduardo Silva. “These influential businessmen often discussed reforms with policymakers” says the dictatorship’s ex-Budget Director Juan Villarzú with the result being “a privileged relationship—and as the period’s history proved one that was highly inconvenient for the national interest—between those businesses and economic policy” according to Chile’s former Secretary of the Presidency (1994-1996) Genaro Arriagada. In his book Desigualdad (Inequality 2019) former Treasury Minister Nicolás Eyzaguirre figures that the groups close to the regime received wealth transfers from the State worth 40 percent of GDP.

“Chile was a laboratory for neoliberalism in its most pure (or extreme) version. Drastic reforms that would be unthinkable in a democracy were executed as military orders without criticism or opposition and at an enormous social and human cost thanks to a dictatorship that used blunt force to block any debate.”

“Shock Treatment is the Only Way”

The first challenge the Chicago Boys faced was to control the hyperinflation unleashed under Allende’s government. To that end they implemented a shock policy following the advice Milton Friedman gave directly to Pinochet when the two met during Friedman’s visit to Chile in 1975: “I think that when a person has a serious illness even more serious measures are needed in order to heal it” Friedman said then. “Shock treatment is the only way.”

The dictatorship implemented drastic cuts in public spending and social investment which led industrial production to fall 28 percent in 1975 while GDP was down 12.9 percent. Then Pinochet’s regime opened the economy quickly which involved liberalizing prices; lowering customs fees from a maximum of 94 percent to a blanket 10 percent duty; eliminating certain taxes; and reducing labor unions to a minimum.

Around 95 percent of public companies were privatized sold at clearance prices to a handful of buyers with ties to the dictatorship. This fostered crony capitalism and the growth of very concentrated economic groups. Key state-owned companies were bought by Pinochet’s cronies. One example is SQM the main producer of lithium that was captured by Pinochet’s son-in-law Julio Ponce. Today SQM is one of the top five lithium companies in the world and Ponce is the second richest billionaire in Chile.

The Chicago Boys and their intellectual mentors placed the word “freedom” at the top of their priority list. The paradox of promoting this supposed economic “freedom” in the midst of a dictatorship is the darkest part of their legacy. Chile was a laboratory for neoliberalism in its most pure (or extreme) version. Drastic reforms that would be unthinkable in a democracy were executed as military orders without criticism or opposition and at an enormous social and human cost thanks to a dictatorship that used blunt force to block any debate.

Friedrich Hayek visited Chile in 1977 and 1981 and he had a favorable opinion of Pinochet: “Sometimes it is necessary for a country to have for a time some form of dictatorial power. As you will understand it is possible for a dictator to govern in a liberal way. And it is also possible for a democracy to govern with a total lack of liberalism” Hayek said in 1981.

“The effective freedom of a person is only guaranteed by an authoritarian government” Sergio de Castro said in 1976. At the end of the dictatorship De Castro would repeat this idea even more brutally: “con una metralleta en la raja todo Chile trabaja.” (That is “with a machine gun up their asses all Chileans work.”)

Machine guns in hand the dictatorship privatized social services like retirement education and health care. It implemented a pension system based on individual capitalization in private for-profit companies (AFPs). It cut off funds to schools and public universities promoting the expansion of subsidized for-profit schools with co-pays which is where the majority of Chilean children study today. And it created Isapres private companies tasked with providing health services.

A Fake “Miracle”

Such was the Chicago Boys’ faith in their ideology that when the Latin American debt crisis exploded in 1981 “they made it clear explicitly that a ‘do-nothing’ policy was the best option” since the economy should be able to adjust on its own said Chilean economy professor Patricio Meller. The consequences were disastrous: Chile’s GDP fell by 15 percent unemployment rose above 30 percent the Central Bank lost half of its international reserves and the country sank into the worst recession since the Great Depression.

The social crisis led to massive protests that put the dictatorship at risk. Pinochet asked for De Castro’s resignation “marking the end of the Chicago Boys’ ‘naive’ phase in power” said Valdés. The course of the dictatorship’s final phase was set by more pragmatic neoliberals such as Treasury Minister Hernán Büchi (1985-1989).

Milton Friedman coined the phrase “The Miracle of Chile” but Pinochet-era results did not look so miraculous: Nobel-prize winning economist Amartya Sen said that “the so-called ‘monetarist experiment’ which lasted until 1982 in its pure form has been the object of much controversy but few have claimed it to be a success.” In his 1991 book Hunger and Public Action Sen emphasizes “the failure of the monetarist experiment to lead to a sustained and broad-based increase in economic prosperity.”

Chile’s GDP grew 2.9 percent annually during the dictatorship putting Pinochet in eighth place out of the nation’s past ten governments between 1958 and 2018. Annual inflation was 79.9 percent the second-highest of the past ten governments. Unemployment averaged 18.0 percent the highest figure in any Chilean government of the past 60 years.

Public spending on education decreased from 3.8 percent of GDP in 1974 to 2.5 percent in 1990 and health spending fell to 2 percent of GDP. In 1990 the country Pinochet handed over was poor and unequal. Poverty measured by the current standard was 68 percent. The GINI inequality index was 0.57 one of the highest in the world similar to the Central African Republic or Guatemala.

Chao Chicago?

Still some of the Chicago Boys’ reforms did plant the seeds for Chile’s development: economic liberalization promotion of private investment and autonomy for the Central Bank. After 1990 the democratic post-Pinochet governments kept these foundations and complemented them with free trade agreements and small tax increases to finance social spending. Between 1990 and 1998 GDP grew 7.1 percent annually inflation fell to 11.7 percent and unemployment dropped to 7.0 percent while poverty decreased steadily to reach 8.6 percent in 2017. The “miracle” came during democracy.

However this “miracle” maintained high inequality rates. Today Chile’s GDP per capita is $25000 but 50 percent of Chilean workers earn less than $6320 per year. According to the World Inequality Database the richest 1 percent in Chile accounts for 28.1 percent of total income which places it as the third most unequal country in the world among those with comparable data only exceeded by the Central African Republic and Mozambique and tied with Mexico. A handful of families dominate the economy and one two or three companies belonging to those family groups dominate markets like pharmacies banking chicken and phone services. In several of these groups cases of collusion tax evasion illegal payments to politicians and consumer fraud have been detected which have ended up without any jail time for the guilty parties.

Moreover the country’s economic model is frayed. Chile’s economy remains basic and rife with rent-seeking centered as it is on mining and fishing: 50 percent of its exports are copper. “We can expect that a nation that has done the same thing for decades but with ever-increasing capital will face decreasing yields. The only way to avoid this is through a high level of investment in science technology and innovation which allows for leaps in productivity. This is not Chile’s case” summarizes the economist Óscar Landerretche. Chile has one of the lowest R&D investment rate in the OECD (states 0.35 percent). Productivity and growth have been on a downward trajectory for the past 15 years.

Stagnation inequality abuse and the opposition to reforms like the one to the private pension system AFP (half of the retired people in Chile received less than $3.106) all led to the great civil uprising of 2019 and eventually to the process of drawing up a new constitution one that will bury Pinochet’s."

The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey which agreed to let the archdiocese rebuild the church at 130 Liberty Street as part of a 2011 land swap agreement signs another deal on August 21 2017 to lease the site to the archdiocese for 198 years. The new agreement sets the rent for the church-shrine at a nominal $1 per year and gives the archdiocese the option to buy the site at any time during the lease also for a nominal fee. The archdiocese agrees to let the Port Authority maintain ownership of the site so that the governmental agency retains responsibility for securing permits and regulatory approvals during the construction process.

But building work stops in December 2017 when Swedish construction company Skanska says the archdiocese is not paying it. The archdiocese reveals months earlier that it is in a severe financial deficit that has been building for years and hires PricewaterhouseCoopers in April 2018 to investigate the church-shrine project’s finances and major cost overruns.

The investigators conclude in October 2018 that there is no evidence of fraud or improper usage of funds by archdiocese members. The archdiocese also accepts the investigators’ call for the creation of a new independent entity “Friends of Saint Nicholas” to raise funds to complete the stalled project.

The Friends of Saint Nicholas group raises millions of additional dollars from private donations enabling construction to resume on August 3 2020. Total raised funds reach $95 million in June 2021 almost five times the original projected cost of the rebuilding.

In a statement to VOA the archdiocese says the church-shrine’s exterior is expected to be completed by the evening of September 10 2021 when it will be illuminated from the inside for the first time.

He was referring to the decision of his successor President Joe Biden to withdraw American troops from Afghanistan.

Some hours earlier it emerged that the Republican National Committee had removed a webpage from 2020 in which it praised Trump for the “historic peace agreement with the Taliban”.

Although the Republicans are struggling to cover up their support for pulling out of Afghanistan amid the fallout of the messy US departure they like the Democrats have known full well that it was inevitable and had to be done. Media reports show many US government officials knew from early on the war was going wrong and was unwinnable – if the purpose was a political solution without the Taliban.

As the world watches the Taliban re-establish the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan 20 years after it was toppled by a US-led invasion one has to ask how is it that Washington harvested such colossal failure? How is it that 40 years after the Vietnam War it repeated the same mistakes – having no clear goals or exit strategy? After so many US officials expressed doubts about the war why was there so little courage to plan and execute properly?

Many see international politics as a game and in this case the game is clear – Jenga. In Jenga players remove pieces from a tower and set them on top until the tower falls. Nobody wins at Jenga; one person loses.

Three administrations in a row knew the tower would fall and nobody would win. Still they pretended in front of the American public that victory was possible and delayed losing by pumping trillions of dollars and sacrificing thousands of civilian and military lives.

They did not prepare for the moment the tower would fall or take steps to help successors manage the eventual collapse. The failure became bigger in the context of promises about nation-building rule of law women’s rights and education cultural change and “dialogue” with the Taliban. In the end Afghanistan lost more than 100000 lives (at least this is what is acknowledged) the US – 2400.

Our history is littered with similarly doomed foreign policy fiascos in which a short-term bias in favour of coercion preempted the long-term benefits of a consistent policy of engagement and diplomacy.

Afghanistan and Iraq are the most recent examples and Vietnam is a classic one but there are also the military occupations of Haiti (1915-34) the Dominican Republic (1916-24) Cuba (1906-09) and Nicaragua (1912-33). None of these occupations produced democracy development or peace. They all reflect the imperial hubris of the American belief in total victories which fails to accept compromise or partial achievements (for instance killing Osama bin Laden should have been enough).

The low politics of buck passing – “the tower will fall but not on my watch” mentality – ignores those like Congresswoman Barbara Lee who called for more time and reflection to take appropriate responses to the 9/11 attacks. Still we play the game over and over knowing full well that nobody can win.

It is worth asking what other Jenga predicaments bedevil US foreign policy? What are the other strategies everyone knows will fail but no president wants to take the blame for allowing the tower to tumble?

One place to begin is the raft of questionable unilateral US sanctions that cause tremendous pain and disarray but have never resulted in the intended outcome of regime change. Instead sanctions cause suffering among large populations and are often counterproductive providing a nationalist boost to otherwise tottering regimes.

Under the current conditions of the pandemic sanctions are not only unproductive; they are cruel and they further drain American power. Worse when unilateral comprehensive embargoes do not work the typical response in Washington is not to question their rationale but to expand them with secondary sanctions to third countries.

The most egregious example is the sanctions against Cuba. Most reasonable observers agree the embargo is ineffective and almost every country in the world besides the US and Israel votes annually at the United Nations to condemn them. Still no president wants to be the one responsible for reversing the embargo with extraterritorial secondary sanctions now in place for 60 years.

One could even argue that it helps the Cuban government to rally its population and brings Washington into conflict with almost every major ally around the world. Rather than peeling away from Beijing and Moscow it pushes Havana towards them. As a result the US continues its embargo causes unnecessary suffering to the Cuban people fails to produce change and turns the US (not Cuba) into an international pariah in conflict with its own allies.

There is only one way to win at political Jenga – don’t play. Imperial hubris leads us to build towers doomed to fall. Each administration piles on new resources and deaths hoping to delay the inevitable at least until they leave office. It is time to recognise an unwinnable game as soon as possible – the US should not be an imperial power should not occupy other countries and should have the courage to end evidently unsuccessful strategies.

Diplomacy trade and engagement multilateralism and peace not war or sanctions should be our default foreign policy tools.

Shortly after al-Qaida terrorists attacked the Twin Towers and the Pentagon many Muslims as well as other Arab Americans became the targets of anger and racism.

Mosques were burned or destroyed and death threats and harassment followed many Muslims in the weeks following the attacks according to congressional testimony from the Southern Poverty Law Center in 2011. Some victims were beaten attacked or held at gunpoint for merely being perceived as Muslim the organization said.

Rep. Ilhan Omar D-Minn. who is Muslim reflected on 9/11 and the discrimination that followed in an interview with ABC News. ""As Americans as people who are living here we were also attacked"" she said. ""This is our community this is our country and there were Muslims who lost their lives in those towers who were Muslim firefighters who lost their lives.""

She added ""There is a desire by many to use our faith and our identity as a weapon against us and to 'other' us. That has been really harmful in so many ways.""

Hate crimes against Muslims rose 1617% from 2000 to 2001 according to the FBI marking some of the highest numbers of Islamophobic hate crimes ever in the U.S.

But even as the country moved further from the attacks and the Muslim American population in the country grew discrimination against this community has not waned Pew Research Center reports.

After the 9/11 attacks

On Sept. 17 2001 then-President George W. Bush spoke at the Islamic Center of Washington D.C. to denounce hatred against Muslims amid his vows to ""win the war against terrorism"" in the Middle East.

""​​The face of terror is not the true faith of Islam"" Bush said. ""That's not what Islam is all about. Islam is peace. These terrorists don't represent peace. They represent evil and war.""

And for the most part the public agreed with the president -- the Pew Research Center found that 59% of people had favorable views of Muslim-Americans following the attacks although 40% of the public believe that the terrorists were motivated at least in part by religion.

However those who didn't view Muslims favorably went on the offense. Across the country reports of bomb threats arson and assaults against Muslims made headlines.

""In the post-9/11 period there was a lot of fear about Muslims and terrorism in the United States and so we created all these new opportunities to surveil citizens and harass citizens and even entrap citizens in our desire to fight terrorism"" said Sally Howell director of the Center for Arab American Studies at the University of Michigan-Dearborn.

As years passed the number of hate crimes dropped (and then rose again in recent years) according to the FBI but the damage was done. For years Muslims in the United States felt unsure about their place in American society according to the research initiative by the University of California Berkeley called Islamophobia Research and Documentation Project.

""This for me is one of the saddest pieces in the survey -- we asked people as a Muslim living in the West if 'I feel more strongly insecure and afraid for my family and kids'"" Hatem Bazian a lecturer at the University of California Berkeley and leader of the college's Islamophobia Research and Documentation Project.

He said that of the people surveyed almost 80% said they feel at least somewhat worried about the safety of their family in the U.S.

And each election cycle that uncertainty about their role in American society was exacerbated. Islamophobia became a political tool with some public figures like former President Donald Trump and media commentators using the fear against Muslims and Arab Americans to rile up their bases.

Islamophobia as a political tool

Anti-Muslim rhetoric was used against former President Barack Obama during both of his presidential campaigns despite the fact that Obama is a Christian. Racist and xenophobic rumors about his religion and about his birthplace were used to stoke outrage and mistrust against Obama weaponizing pre-existing fear about Muslims.

Opponents doubled down on conspiracy theories about Obama concerning his nationality and religion -- falsely claiming that he was ineligible to become the president because he was not born in the U.S. or that he secretly practiced Islam which would not make him ineligible for the presidency.

""Islamophobia was monetized into votes at the ballot box by projecting Obama as a closet Muslim"" Bazian said.

Anti-Muslim sentiment continued during the 2016 election cycle during which Islamophobic hate crimes surged again.

According to the FBI there were 481 incidents in 2001 followed by a significant decline in incidents the next year -- 155.

In 2015 there were 257 hate crimes against Muslims and 307 in 2016. The number of incidents has declined since then through 2019 the latest year for which data is available.

Experts link the rise in hate to the anti-Muslim rhetoric being espoused on the political stage. then-candidate Trump made the Islamic faith and Muslims targets of criticism throughout his presidential campaign including proposing a ban on Muslims entering the country.

In November 2015 he made unsubstantiated claims on ABC News that Arab Americans were celebrating the fall of the Twin Towers: ""There were people over in New Jersey that were watching it a heavy Arab population that were cheering as the buildings came down. Not good.""

In March 2016 Trump claimed on CNN that hatred defined the Islam faith saying ""I think Islam hates us. There's something there that — there's a tremendous hatred there. There's a tremendous hatred. We have to get to the bottom of it. There's an unbelievable hatred of us.""

During the first months of the Trump administration the Pew Research Center reported that roughly 75% of Muslim American adults said there is a lot of discrimination against Muslims in the U.S.

Shortly into his time in office Trump signed an executive order that barred immigrants from several Muslim-majority countries in a move that critics say enshrined his anti-Muslim stance into law. While he was a presidential candidate he called for a complete ban on Muslims entering the United States.

The measure was legally challenged until the Supreme Court upheld an amended version of the order in 2018. It affected travelers and immigrants from Muslim-majority countries like Iran Somalia Yemen Syria and Libya.

It also included North Koreans and some Venezuelans and other nations were added to the list in 2020.

From 2017 to 2021 when Biden ended the ban more than 40000 people were refused visas because of the executive order according to U.S. State Department figures.

Trump and supporters of the order denied that it was Islamophobic saying instead that it was protecting the U.S. from terrorism. But advocates say that the order which is no longer in effect legitimized hatred and fear of Muslims making life and immigration to the U.S. much harder.

""It takes a long time to undo the effects of these types of messages and these types of campaigns"" Bazian said. ""Islamophobia is not really about Muslims. It uses Muslims but it's not about Muslims. It's about the rallying the discomfort of certain pockets of Western society at a time of unsureness.""

Now Muslim communities across the country are focused on building safe communities and curbing Islamophobia with education and outreach following years of anti-Muslim rhetoric in the White House.

Building community and combatting discrimination

Despite efforts by some groups to quell this population Muslims have continued to grow and thrive in the U.S.

Muslims have slowly gained representation in the government in U.S. television and a presence in the public sphere across the country.

""If you look at the Detroit area and the contributions that immigrants from the Muslim world are making to society and the economy -- they're just the bedrock and backbone of so many local industries"" Howell said.

In 2007 the first Muslim member of Congress Rep. Keith Ellison D-Minn. was elected. In 2018 voters elected the first Muslim women to hold a seat in Congress: Democratic Reps. Omar and Rashida Tlaib.

In an interview Tlaib told ABC News that her Muslim faith and background helps her understand the harm that can come from Islamophobia and xenophobia.

""We can be there to talk about it and say 'no it didn't work 20 years ago it's not going to work now. And you're actually making us less safe in your and you're also enabling hate and racism in our country when you target people solely based on their faith'"" Tlaib said. ""I think that's why were so strongly in opposition of the ban on people of Muslim faith into our country and so much more.""

The Muslim population in the U.S. continues to rise and is projected to have grown to 3.85 million people in 2020 according to the Pew Research Center. And as more Muslims continue to cultivate communities across the country more houses of worship in the U.S. have appeared over the last 20 years as well.

The Cooperative Congregational Studies Partnership found 1209 mosques in the U.S. in 2000 -- and that number more than doubled in 2020 when researchers found at least 2769 mosques.

Islam has been seen in the Western world in a negative light according to Bazian who believes this negative portrayal couldn't be further from the truth. He says education is the first step to ridding the faith and its people of this stigma.

""They created this fear that America is being taken over by Muslims"" Bazian said recommending training to teachers human resources and the workplace. ""We have been playing ignorant for some time so education is still one of the primary tools to counter Islamophobia.""

Most Americans don't know a Muslim or admit to not knowing anything about Muslims according to a Pew Research Center survey.

""The public has fairly limited sort of direct knowledge or interaction with Muslims"" said Dr. Besheer Mohamed a senior researcher at Pew Research Center. ""People who say they personally know someone who's Muslim then they have more positive views toward Islam and toward Muslims than people who don't.""

This invisibility Howell said is what is giving Islamophobia its power.

""It's important that we understand that because we need to know that Muslims are not outsiders they're not strangers"" Howell said. ""When Muslims are visible to non-Muslims through their institutions through their names through their headscarves through the Halal signs on their restaurants then people would know their co-workers their neighbors as Muslims and this helps overcome whatever you know prejudice or concern they might have.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vYmVhcmluZ2RyaWZ0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzA5LzExLzg0NmFtLW9uLTktMTEtYW1lcmljYS1pcy11bmRlci1hdHRhY2stbm9ydGgtdG93ZXItb2Ytd3RjLWhpdC0zL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,8:46am on 9/11: America Is Under Attack North Tower of WTC Hit,"8:46am on 9/11: America Is Under Attack North Tower of WTC Hit

He decided to create a similar replica of the twin towers and place it in front of his business.

“I got the idea off of social media a friend of mine a group of veterans they built one in front of their business. I thought it was a great representation of how America comes together in times of need and sometimes in times of tragedy” Massey said.

Massey strategically placed the replica directly under the American flag and unveiled it Saturday.

“I think to myself where were we that day and I think how it was a terrible tragedy but I think how it united Americans. We were no longer this color or that color or this religion or that religion … we were no longer all these different things. We were just all Americans” Massey said.

Massey said he believes he will leave the memorial up in front of his business year-round.

“I got the specs from a friend of mine who built one. It’s exactly to scale the antennas to scale the placement is to scale. And then we had to order the metal. It took a week or two and then it took a couple of days to build it” Massey said.

Micheal Neuwirth an employee for Tri State said that seeing the monument for the first time left him in awe.

“Actually it was a heartfelt tears of joy moment. It is definitely a tear-jerker for this to be done” Neuwirth said.

The remembrance also featured a memorial ride with 13 American flags to honor and represent the 13 American soldiers killed in the Kabul airport attack.

For Savannah Morning News

The phrase “municipal building” does not always inspire visions of beautiful buildings with fascinating histories. The Municipal Archives is here to change that! Our new series Building History will share histories and images of some of Savannah’s fascinating and maybe not as well known municipal buildings and facilities.

To kick the series off we bring you the history of Savannah’s Industrial and Domestic (I&D) Water Treatment Plant. In 1937 Mayor Robert M. Hitch’s administration acknowledged the need for a new water source to supplement current industries in the area as well as to attract new industry to Savannah.

A 1940 study suggested pulling water from Abercorn Creek to a treatment facility near Savannah. In February 1945 the Georgia Legislature established the Industrial and Domestic Water Supply Commission “for the specific and express purpose of administering the construction and the operation of a plant to provide an additional industrial and domestic water supply which shall be kept and maintained separate and distinct from the Water Department… of the City of Savannah.” Construction on the water filtration plant began in January 1947.

Abercorn Creek a tributary of the Savannah River serves as the raw water source for the plant. Surface water is withdrawn from the creek in Effingham County and pumped approximately 10 miles through two pipelines to the filtration plant located at Cherokee Hill in Port Wentworth off Highway 21 west of Savannah. Although constructed primarily to provide water for industrial use the I&D Plant filters and treats the water raw from the creek and produces potable (finished) water suitable for human consumption.

The construction of the water plant was a major factor in attracting new industry to the Savannah area particularly the Southern Paperboard Plant. When the I&D Plant opened in 1948 it had a daily capacity of 35 million gallons of potable water nearly three times the daily use in the city at that time.

Over the years the plant was upgraded and now has a daily capacity of 75 million gallons. The I&D Plant has been designated an American Water Works Association Landmark and while the building is utilitarian it also exhibits decorative features such as the mosaic of the City Seal at the bottom of one of the indoor filtration pools. This feature is not only decorative but helps to display the stages of the water as it works through the filtration process.

In 1995 the I&D Commission was eliminated and the I&D Plant now falls under the City’s Public Works and Water Resources division. Although I&D still supplies water to industries it also supplies some domestic water to Savannah and sells water to neighboring cities in Chatham Effingham and Bryan counties.

However weak infrastructure and climate change are challenging Mexico City’s ability to provide clean and adequate water to residents. Mexico City’s water is quite literally disappearing. “I have no doubt that in 2022 there will be a crisis the reservoirs are completely depleted” says water expert Rafael Sanchez Bravo.

What is happening?

The ancient Aztecs originally engineered the origins of Mexico City on top of Lake Texcoco and left the surrounding natural freshwater lakes intact for use. However as the city grew the lakes were drained to make way for infrastructure homes and a growing population. With expansion came an increasingly dire water security dilemma. Much of the city’s water supply comes from an underground aquifer that is being drained at an irreplaceable rate. As the aquifer is drained Mexico City is sinking downwards rapidly at twenty inches per year.

Despite heavy flooding and rainfall the city is facing a water shortage. In fact more than 20 million residents don’t have enough water to drink for nearly half the year. According to the BBC one in five people have access to only a few hours of running water from their taps a week and 20% have running water for part of the day. Counting on clean water is far from reliable for many.

Current projections estimate that global demand for fresh water will exceed supply by 40% in 2030. Mexico City one of the largest cities in the world has a population of nearly 22 million and is growing steadily with population growth expected to hit 30 million by 2030.

Mexico City is one of 11 cities predicted to reach what is called Day Zero or the day when the water runs dry. This is nothing short of a crisis. “Each drop of water that passes through the Mexican capital tells a heroic tragic unfinished story of urban growth and human development” writes Jonathan Watts for The Guardian.

Where is the water?

There are a few reasons why a city on top of an aquifer and with a very heavy rainy season struggles to provide potable water for its residents. Specifically the challenges to water security are widespread and difficult for urban designers environmentalists and politicians alike.

A lack of sanitary wastewater treatment across the city hinders water collection and poses a huge challenge to keeping existing water clean for use. Additionally Mexico City’s pipes are old and leaking. According to the University of Pittsburgh Mexico City loses 1000 liters of water per second because of an outdated water system that is being crushed by the falling city and punctuated by thousands of small leaks. Finally rainwater collection exists but no city-wide system is in place. When it rains water often mixes with sewage and cannot be used.

Why is the city sinking?

Mexico City ended all groundwater drilling in the city central in the 1950s yet water is pumped up from below in the surrounding areas and GPS data has found the city is continuing to drop. As water extraction has chased groundwater deeper and deeper underground the clay lake bed is now completely dry and the tightly packed mineral soil is causing irreversible compaction. This phenomenon called subsistence does not have a quick fix.

Additionally water from rain storms cannot permeate the concrete-covered city and refill the aquifer. A 2021 study made the claim that there is no hope for significant elevation and storage capacity recovery. Much of the water must be pumped to the city using hydro engineering from reservoirs thousands of kilometers away.

Climate change is a threat multiplier

Mexico continues to experience one of the most widespread droughts in decades. Unusually low rainfall has already reduced access to water in the capital. The reservoirs in Cutzamala outside the city provide a quarter of the city’s water but in 2020 the reservoirs were nearly 18 percentage points below normal levels. As precious reservoir levels plummet the city authorities have reduced the flow from the reservoirs which has been affecting tap water access. Some residents are relying on water delivery trucks and even donkeys.

This occurrence is predicted to repeat. “Climate change has definitely changed rainfall patterns” Rafael Carmona Paredes director of the Water System of Mexico City (SACMEX) told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. “We have to prepare ourselves in lots of ways to be able to cope with these variations in climate conditions.” Researchers have estimated the availability of natural water for the city could decrease by up to 17% by 2050 as temperatures rise.

“More heat and drought mean more evaporation and yet more demand for water adding pressure to tap distant reservoirs at staggering costs or further drain underground aquifers and hasten the city’s collapse” writes Michael Kimmelman for the New York Times.

Researchers have pointed out potential future issues facing water supply. Global warming could exacerbate the water crisis in Mexico City with less rainfall algae blooms in warm reservoirs and increased demand for water as a result of a warming planet.

What has been done?

Mexico recognizes the pressing issue of water facing their biggest city. Mexico City initiated the Green Plan project which will run until 2022 with goals such as reducing groundwater losses and repairing water infrastructure among others.

Former president Enrique Peña Nieto signed a series of presidential decrees in 2018 to create water reserves in nearly 300 river basins throughout the country. And $7.4 billion has been dedicated to mitigating the water crisis by Mexico City Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo in 2019.

An expert offers a solution

While current state and local decrees are a big step towards a necessary goal according to Harvard-educated Water Sensitive Urban Design (WSUD) expert and architect Loreta Castro Reguera the most effective approach is a decentralized one and sustainable as well as accessible to communities city-wide.

WSUD is an emerging approach to urban development aimed at minimizing the hydrological impacts of urban development on the environment. Latin America Reports spoke to Requera about her Mexico-city based team and their mission of designing the city through infrastructural public spaces that promote access for impacted communities and understanding different strategies for managing water.

“It’s a paradox. It’s a catastrophe. Right now we have a city that is sinking and our infrastructure is literally breaking. And on the other hand we have no way for the water to filter [into the aquifer] naturally” says Reguera. “And you can imagine how expensive it is to change the entire piping system.”

Her projects demonstrate that public spaces can serve simultaneously as parallel water management infrastructures. Reguera and her partner Jose have coined the term “retroactive infrastructure.” This refers to non-traditional infrastructure that can solve rather than exacerbate the water issues. Some projects include water filtration systems and utilizing open spaces to catch and save rainwater in larger tanks than would fit in a building. “We want these spaces to become decentralized infrastructure” she says.

“For example we completely transformed the landscape of a park in a very poor community. It was on a hillside and instead of just a slope we terraced the slope and filled the terraces with local volcanic gravel which is highly permeable. We created filtration terraces and made it a sponge to catch rainwater and filter it into the aquifer. We removed the fences opened the entrances and kept all the trees.”

“It is not like we will solve the water crisis with rainwater collection but it could help a lot if we start making reservoirs all around the city” she says. “So the question is how we can start transforming these reservoirs into open and public spaces. They can provide enough water for the entire city.”

Reguera is hopeful. The city has been active in creating wetland systems to treat wastewater that will eventually become a source of water for the surrounding areas. “It is really great to see how the city is making an effort” she says. “They are experimenting to see how much open spaces can work. It is something that only started three or four years ago so we won’t see a transformation immediately. But there is a lot of consciousness right now.”

Reguera describes the work of parallel infrastructure as “stitching together the city with open spaces.” There is no easy solution to Mexico City’s water crisis but perhaps it lies in communal accessible spaces above ground instead of below.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhbW9hb2JzZXJ2ZXIud3MvY2F0ZWdvcnkvd29ybGQvOTEyNznSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New Jersey American Water Response to Tropical Depression Ida: Raritan-Millstone Flood Protection Project Passes ...,"CAMDEN N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sep 10 2021--

In the aftermath of Topical Depression Ida New Jersey American Water the state’s largest water and wastewater utility company reports that all its operating areas successfully withstood widespread flooding and drinking water quality was not impacted in any of its service areas. New Jersey American Water successfully implemented flood protection plans at all its treatment plants and other facilities adjusted treatment processes as needed to continue to meet water quality standards despite challenging source water conditions and maintained operations of all plants under regular or alternative power sources throughout the storm.

This includes the Raritan-Millstone Water Treatment Plant which was fortified with a $37 million flood protection project in 2018 to withstand floods that are categorized to occur on a 500-year frequency. Situated in Bridgewater Somerset County N.J. the Raritan-Millstone plant is New Jersey American Water’s largest water production facility and a regional source of potable water supply for approximately 1 million people in parts of seven counties in central New Jersey. The plant is located near the confluence of the Raritan and Millstone Rivers – an area of Somerset County that experiences severe flooding during significant storm events due to the relative low ground surface elevations in the floodways adjacent to the two rivers.

“If this storm had happened prior to 2018 we would be telling a different story today. The investments we made into protecting this critical facility has proven to be invaluable by holding up against this historic flood and enabling us to continue to provide water service to the 1 million customers who get their drinking water from this plant” said Mark McDonough President New Jersey American Water.

Prior to the $37 million flood protection investment project the earthen berms and north side reinforced concrete flood wall surrounding the plant were previously designed to provide flood protection for a 100-year flood event which is marked by an elevation of 44 feet. This level was tested several times particularly during Hurricane Irene during which the flood waters came within one inch of the top of the wall. With the completion of the 2018 project the entire floodwall system at the plant was raised by four feet to an elevation of 48 feet which is the level of flood resiliency supported by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Army Corp of Engineers which provides flood protection from storm events up to 500-year recurring frequency. During Tropical Depression Ida the Raritan River crested at a record 44.87 feet at its peak on Sept. 2.

McDonough continued “Along with the needed infrastructure to maintain operations in an emergency it is essential to have a dedicated team of experts and we are very fortunate to have that as well. As we executed our emergency response plans which included closing and sealing our flood gates our licensed operators plant managers and other critical staff remained at the plant for more than 48 hours until the flood water receded and we could safely open the gates and replace them with another shift of qualified experts. Their courage and tireless dedication are to be commended.”

In the days preceding the storm the company executed its emergency response plans which included stocking up on supplies fuel food and other provisions to enable critical workers to remain at its water and wastewater treatment facilities for several days if needed. At the Raritan-Millstone facility workers planning to stay once the flood gates came down were not able to get back to the plant in time as the water rose much faster than anticipated and the gates needed to be shut early leaving the current shift of workers in place unexpectedly for 48 hours. But due to sound preparation and guidance from experienced staff both within and outside of the plant the team prevailed until the flood waters receded and the gates could be opened to allow for them to leave and another shift of staff to enter the facility.

New Jersey American Water invests more than $350 million annually to upgrade and renew water and wastewater treatment plants pipes pumping stations and other essential facilities including an increased focus on incorporating climate variability into the company’s asset investment strategy. New Jersey American Water works to protect the viability integrity and resiliency of water supplies and water and wastewater infrastructure in its service areas that are vulnerable to droughts floods and extreme weather events.

Sixty years after the United States’ failed Bay of Pigs invasion the remnants of the US and Cuba’s fractured relationship are tucked away in a small neighborhood of the US Naval base at Guantánamo Bay. Nineteen Cubans still live on the base almost 60 years after the base closed its borders with the island nation it sits on the edge of.

In a small neighborhood on the base known as Center Bargo one of the many military housing complexes where the 6000 military service members civilians and other residents of the base reside sits the Cuban Community Center. The squat government building is one of the only reminders of a country and culture that the 45-square-mile base leases its land from.

Noel West 89 lives across the street from the community center. West and the other 18 Cubans still living on the base are known as Special Category Residents or SCRs. They were given that designation by the US State Department after the border between the Naval base and Cuba closed permanently in the 1960s. Under the designation they are considered US citizens.

While the US and Cuba restored full diplomatic ties in 2015 relations between the two Cold War-era foes remain tense.

West and the other Cubans have been on this side of the base for so long many of them are older and have since retired. The US Naval base provides them with home health care and has built a home health facility for the ones who are not able to live at home alone.

‘She never saw me in Cuba again’

West started working on the base as a clerk in 1955. Originally from the small Cuban town of Guaro West was living in Guantánamo City when he got the job as a clerk ordering fuel for planes and vehicles on the base. For nine years West commuted back and forth from his home in Guantánamo City to the Naval base passing through the gate between Cuba and the base every day on his commute.

In February 1964 West decided to spend the night at the Cuban barracks on the base instead of commuting home because he said he wanted to watch a baseball game. The next day his neighbor called him and said that Cuban soldiers had come to his house looking for him the night before.

“My next-door neighbor that lived on the Cuban side called me from his work here on the base and he asked me if I had gone out the night before. I said ‘No why?’ He said ‘Well there was about eight soldiers looking for you” West said.

West never went back to his home in Cuba after that. He stayed on the US Naval base and has lived here ever since.

West believes the soldiers were looking for him because he had made some comments to his friend with whom he played baseball about not liking the new Castro communist regime on the island. Shortly after that conversation guards appeared at his door he said.

“My mother … she never saw me in Cuba again” West said.

Mother and son met up in Jamaica a few years later when she was able to leave the island but West has never left the base to return to any other part of Cuba since he decided to stay on the US side in 1964.

West stayed on the base working in the same clerical job until he retired in 2011. He worked for 55 years straight he said nine before moving to the base full-time and retiring with 4000 hours of unused sick leave.

An avid lover of baseball West used to umpire baseball games on the base outside of work. Now he spends time on his computer watches baseball and news on TV and is visited by two home health nurses who take him to do things around the island daily.

Keeping a culture alive

Dana Lane the Cuban Community Manager on the Naval base helps take care of the 19 aging residents all between the ages of 78 and 90. She organizes cultural activities at the community center like Cuban food cooking nights dominoes and bingo games and helps coordinate care for the residents.

Lane has been the Cuban Community Manager since 2015. She is Panamanian.

“They’re family. They’re relatives” Lane said of the residents. “The job completely changed now.”

At one point there were nearly 350 Cuban Special Category Residents living on the base. Over time people have moved away or passed on. Some of the children of the original SCRs have moved away to different parts of the United States Lane said.

West chose to stay on the base because he had a stable job he said and he liked that the base was the size of a small town like the one he’d grown up in but with more infrastructure. He believed life on the base would be better than staying in Cuba.

“It’s about the size of my hometown. No bigger but more advanced” West said. “I’ve never seen a concrete building in my hometown.”

West was also critical of the Castro regime and noticed that it was hard for people to get jobs that paid well in Cuba.

Lane said most of the residents who stayed on the US Naval base were “against the regime” referring to the Cuban government.

A tense history

Cuba and the US have had fractured political relations since the early 1960s. In 1961 the US attempted to invade Cuba famously known as the Bay of Pigs invasion. In 1962 the US came close to a nuclear war during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Former President John F. Kennedy later imposed an embargo on trade with Cuba that remains in place to this day.

In the early 1960s as relations between the two countries were deteriorating the US naval base at Guantánamo Bay was caught up in the changing political landscape. Many Cubans used to commute to the base for different jobs daily passing through a gate between Guantánamo and the naval base. After the border between the base and the rest of Cuba closed residents had to decide if they were going to give up their jobs on the base or stay and live on the base forever.

The US took Guantánamo Bay in 1898 during the Spanish-American War. After Cuba gained independence in 1903 they leased 45 square miles on the bay to the US for construction of a naval station. In 1934 the US and Cuba signed a perpetual lease putting the cost of rent for the 45 square miles at $4085 a year.

In 1964 Castro cut off water to the base claiming the Americans were taking Cuban water. On the US side of the border a dug-up hole shows where US military members cut off the water line to Cuba.

The US cut off the water line they shared with Cuba in 1964 after Fidel Castro complained that the US was stealing water from Cuba. A red marker near the North East Gate commemorates the spot where the water line was cut. Ellie Kaufman/CNN

Next to the water break a sign reads “On 17 Feb 1964 Rear Admiral John D. Bulkeley Commander Naval Base ordered the water lines be cut and section removed to disprove the assumption that the United States was stealing water from Cuba” in black all-capital letters.

The Cuban government continues to demand the return of the area occupied by the Naval base and says it does not cash the checks the US sends every year to pay for the base. Many Cuban historians argue the US an occupying force at the time strong-armed Cuba to hand over the land for the base which was originally a coaling station for ships.

Now US military members meet with Cuban military officers once a month in what is known as “fence line” meetings to discuss upcoming maneuvers and other issues. They switch off who hosts the meeting each month.

While there is little communication outside of these meetings there is occasional coordination. In February 2018 Cuban military and firefighters helped the base put out a wildfire that exploded land mines on the Cuban side and threatened houses on the base.

US officials say they removed thousands of the land mines placed around the base years ago and replaced them with lights and motion sensors.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndwci5vcmcvZW52aXJvbm1lbnQvaXRzLWNyaW1pbmFsLW1pbHdhdWtlZWFucy1jYWxsLXNwZWVkaWVyLWxlYWQtcGlwZWxpbmUtcmVtb3ZhbC1jdXQtY2hpbGRob29kLXBvaXNvbmluZ9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'It's Criminal': Milwaukeeans Call For Speedier Lead Pipeline Removal To Cut Childhood Poisoning,"Sitting in his North Side Milwaukee rental house Nazir Al-Mujaahid spoke matter-of-factly about the challenges his son Shu’aib faces while the quiet 9-year-old lingered in another room. Shu’aib excels at sports Al-Mujaahid said but his speaking skills developed late and he still lags behind his 6-year-old brother in reading.

Al-Mujaahid 45 believes that lead poisoning is hindering his son’s development. Confirming precisely where the lead came from is impossible but Al-Mujaahid suspects the aging lead pipelines that carried drinking water into his home.

The city for years failed to warn the family of potential lead hazards in their home — or that Shu’aib registered elevated lead levels as a toddler in 2014 Al-Mujaahid said. Three years later the family stopped drinking from their tap after learning about risks from lead pipes.

The family suspects the lead pipe that carries water into their home is to blame.

“My awareness of it hasn’t been an issue taken seriously at all. It’s got some media attention but it’s a joke here” Al-Mujaahid said. “I found out about it because my son wasn’t developing normally.”

Shu’aib is among 9600 Wisconsin children younger than 16 found to be poisoned by lead between 2018 and 2020 according to Wisconsin Department of Health Services data. The neurotoxin damages the brain and nervous system particularly in young children sometimes causing learning and behavioral problems and stunted growth.

Nearly two-thirds of Wisconsin’s lead-poisoned children live in Milwaukee County where 5.6 percent of children tested in 2020 had blood lead levels above 5 micrograms per deciliter the level that the state defines as poisoning. That’s compared to 3.4 percent of children statewide. Wisconsin saw 23 percent fewer children tested for lead between 2019 and 2020 as the pandemic kept many families out of clinics for check-ups .

Children can become lead poisoned by ingesting paint lead-tainted water soil dust or other lead-based products. Some 90 percent of Wisconsin’s lead-poisoned children live in homes built before 1950 according to DHS. Those homes are more likely to have lead-based paint and lead plumbing.

Gov. Tony Evers and Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett have called for more aggressive lead service line replacements but their own health departments primarily focus on addressing lead paint and dust calling that the predominant hazard as do many experts and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .

Since 2016 when the Flint Michigan water crisis was declared a disaster Wisconsin has replaced about 20 percent of known service lines made of lead and galvanized steel that might contain lead flake buildup — or other materials that might contain lead according to a Wisconsin Watch analysis of state Public Service Commission data.

Despite that Wisconsin doesn’t require local governments to test drinking water during home lead hazard investigations even though it can make up 20 percent of a person’s total exposure to lead according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency — or up to 60 percent for infants consuming mostly mixed formula

Activist Says Problem Is ‘Public Health Crisis’

Childhood lead poisoning rates in Milwaukee and statewide have steadily decreased in recent decades — in line with national trends since lead was phased out in paint and gasoline. Yet Milwaukee in 2020 still had a higher percentage of lead-poisoned children than Flint did in 2015 after state officials approved a drinking water switch without treating for corrosion — causing lead to leach into drinking water.

Al-Mujaahid is among residents urging Milwaukee officials to bolster lead poisoning prevention efforts — including by investigating risks from lead in drinking water and accelerating replacements of lead service lines.

Eliminating the city’s remaining 70000 lead pipes at that pace would take more than 70 years and cost hundreds of millions of dollars. Isaac Wasserman/Wisconsin Watch

Calls to focus on drinking water hazards come as the Milwaukee Health Department seeks to rebuild trust in the three years since Barrett announced that the department failed to track whether it alerted thousands of families that tests detected lead poisoning in their children. The city is awaiting the conclusion of a criminal investigation that local news reports have linked to the health department’s response to childhood lead poisoning . First-year Milwaukee Health Commissioner Kirsten Johnson has called lead poisoning the city’s “pandemic before the (COVID-19) pandemic” and her top priority to tackle.

Some other major Wisconsin cities — notably Madison and Green Bay — have replaced all of their lead pipelines. But Milwaukee is much larger and installed exponentially more lead service lines than others. Although most communities were moving away from lead service lines by the 1920s Milwaukee stuck with lead for longer amid lead industry lobbying — mandating their use until 1948 and waiting until 1962 to ban them.

Wisconsin communities have replaced more than 115000 utility-owned and privately-owned service line portions since 2016 when the state launched a grant program to help utilities finance upgrades that can cost thousands of dollars per pipeline a Wisconsin Watch analysis shows. Still lurking in 2020 however: an estimated 465000 pipeline portions made of lead or other potentially hazardous materials. (Most service lines consist of a utility-owned portion and a privately-owned portion.)

Milwaukee has replaced less than 1000 of its full lead service lines annually since launching its effort in 2017. Replacing the remaining 70000 lead pipes at that pace would take more than 70 years and the full price tag would cost hundreds of millions of dollars that city officials say they lack.

Wisconsin’s Republican-controlled Legislature has rejected Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’ years-long push to boost funding for pipeline replacements statewide with some Republicans saying too much money would flow to Milwaukee. Federal funding may provide the most hope including pandemic stimulus dollars that could pay for pipelines and President Joe Biden’s infrastructure bill a version of which the U.S. Senate approved this month .

But some residents are tired of waiting saying that Milwaukee should make pipeline removal a higher priority.

“It’s a public health crisis” said Derek Beyer a steering committee member of Get The Lead Out  a coalition of Milwaukee groups fighting for speedier replacements. “It’s not an option to wait 30 more years or whatever to beg for some money that might not ever come.”

Milwaukee Family Not Notified

The Al-Mujaahid family has rented a house in the predominantly Black Roosevelt Grove neighborhood since 2014. The home has lead service lines city records show but Al-Mujaahid knew little of such hazards until a few years later. And in 2017 a fingerstick test detected 11.4 micrograms per deciliter of lead in Shu’aib’s blood prompting the Milwaukee Health Department to warn the family in a letter that “Lead poisoning is a serious illness which can cause behavior and learning problems.”

In 2017 a test detected 11.4 micrograms per deciliter in Shu’aib’s blood which prompted the Milwaukee Health Department to warn the family in a letter that Shu’aib was lead poisoned. It wasn’t the first time that Shu’aib tested positive for lead poisoning. A 2014 test had flagged 6.4 micrograms per deciliter of lead in Shu’aib’s blood. No immediate followup tests were scheduled and Al-Mujaahid said he wasn’t notified. Isaac Wasserman/Wisconsin Watch

The test came as Shu’aib then 4 years old was developing his speaking skills more slowly than his peers Al-Mujaahid said adding that he was more introverted than other children. The family initially suspected autism.

Along with the warning letter the health department sent fliers on how to reduce children’s exposure to lead and apply for funding to replace windows or to remove other home lead hazards.

It wasn’t the first time that Shu’aib tested positive for lead poisoning. A 2014 test had flagged 6.4 micrograms per deciliter in Shu’aib’s blood. No immediate follow up tests were scheduled records show and Al-Mujaahid said he wasn’t notified of the high level. The health department could not confirm whether its current notification policy for test results of at least 5 micrograms per deciliter was in place at the time spokesperson Emily Tau told Wisconsin Watch.

“We didn’t really get anything until years later. So we weren’t even aware that we should have been very concerned” Al-Mujaahid said.

Milwaukee Water Works tested the home’s drinking water after Milwaukee Neighborhood News Service profiled the family’s lead saga in 2018. Three samples showed lead levels ranging from 0.35 to 2.5 parts per billion (ppb) records show. That’s far below the EPA’s long-unchanged 15 ppb “action level” — the trigger for public water systems to take actions such as pipeline replacement and education.

But many expertscall the federal threshold far too high  considering that no level of lead exposure is considered safe. Biden’s EPA has delayed and is reviewing Trump administration rule revisions that would leave the action level in place.

The Al-Mujaahids turned away from tap water after learning about the lead pipelines in their home. For drinking and cooking they use 5-gallon jugs of store-bought water. And the family wonders whether lead-tainted water flowed through their previous North Side Milwaukee rental home where they lived when Shu’aib was first tested. That house also has lead service lines city records show.

City Department Faces Scrutiny

The family’s experience wasn’t unique. In January 2018 Barrett announced that his office identified “mismanagement and significant shortfalls” in how the Milwaukee Health Department followed up with families about elevated lead levels in children. Mainly the department lost track of whether it had followed up with 8000 families over three years whose children registered elevated lead blood levels.

A 2020 Public Health Foundation audit found the department made progress in fixing the lead poisoning program but it failed to resolve all shortcomings identified before 2018. Among the lingering issues: “inefficient and ineffective” documentation and surveillance systems for blood testing slow and potentially incomplete risk assessments of lead exposure long waits for lead-safe housing for children with elevated lead blood levels and a lack of accountability in budgeting. The department last month acknowledged that it failed to follow up with a family of multiple lead-poisoned children and it is planning a fresh audit.

“Overcoming these challenges and rectifying any mishandlings of cases is a tremendous task that will take time” Tyler Weber Milwaukee Deputy Commissioner of Environmental Health told Wisconsin Watch in a statement adding that his team is “dedicated to urgently achieving” that goal.

City Effort Was Prioritizing Paint

Barrett Evers and the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources have for years publicly backed the idea of aggressive pipeline removal — pending available funding calling lead-tainted water a significant threat. But health officials continue to prioritize paint over drinking water when investigating lead hazards in homes.

“The Milwaukee Health Department’s focus is on lead abatement in paint and soil as lead-based paint hazards are the primary source of lead exposure in the Milwaukee community” Weber said. “However we know lead poisoning can also occur from contaminated drinking water so the Milwaukee Health Department distributes free water filters to anyone in the city of Milwaukee who needs them to eradicate the danger until Milwaukee Water Works is able to replace the service line to the home.”

Spurred by the widely publicized lead-in-water crisis of Flint Michigan Eau Claire has replaced hundreds of its 1266 lead service lines since 2017 and has a goal to finish by 2023. Madeline Fuerstenberg/Wisconsin Watch

A spokesperson for the Wisconsin Department of Health Services which contracts with local health departments to follow up with families after positive tests for lead poisoning downplayed drinking water hazards in an email to Wisconsin Watch.

“Water is not an issue in Wisconsin the way paint is when it comes to lead poisoning” spokesperson Elizabeth Goodsitt wrote.

That contrasts with other Evers administration messaging. Evers since 2019 has unsuccessfully pushed the Legislature to approve $40 million for additional lead service line replacements and his DNR chief Preston Cole said in July : “We know aging water pipes can leach lead into the drinking water causing serious health problems especially for infants and children.”

Wisconsin local health departments in 2019 identified lead-based paint as a hazard in 97 percent of investigations of elevated blood levels Goodsitt noted and they flagged other primary hazards just 3 percent of the time. The disparity widened in 2020 with investigations implicating paint 99 percent of the time.

But local health departments investigate only a fraction of lead poisoning cases in Wisconsin and they rarely test drinking water — meaning that most drinking water hazards would not be reflected in such data.

The state mandates investigations and case management services for children only when one venous blood test detects at least 20 micrograms per deciliter of lead — or if two tests conducted at least 90 days apart find lead at 15 micrograms per deciliter. That’s far above the 5-microgram threshold that the state defines as poisoning.

“The blood lead level at which a (local health department) intervenes is dependent on their caseload and resources” Goodsitt told Wisconsin Watch.

Water Testing Not Required

“Health departments are not required to test water as a part of their lead hazard investigation and it is uncommon to have water samples collected during an investigation” DHS told Wisconsin Watch in an email from another spokesperson Jennifer Miller. “Instead if there is any question about the water we always suggest installing filters at the point of use or the family use a different known safe source of water (bottled).”

Investigators sometimes test water from private wells DHS added.

Milwaukee offers — and strongly encourages — drinking water testing for families during elevated blood level investigations but doing so requires consent from all tenants of a building Tau said in an email. Water must stay stagnant in service lines for at least eight hours. “This poses an additional challenge for homes that are multi-family homes duplexes triplexes etc. and some tenants choose to opt out of the water testing for that reason” Tau said.

Henry Anderson a University of Wisconsin-Madison professor of population health and expert on environmental and occupational diseases said prioritizing paint hazards made sense — particularly for protecting toddlers who can cruise around a house.

“There’s so much more lead in a paint chip than there is in a glass of water” said Anderson Wisconsin’s former state chief medical officer. “When there’s an old house it has paint chipping off the walls they are crawling around putting their hands in their mouth — and hands are sticky. And so ingestion of paint chips remains important.”

But Marc Edwards a Virginia Tech University engineering professor who helped expose Flint’s water blunder  is among experts who contend that governments dangerously downplay drinking water’s role in lead poisoning by focusing on paint. Edwards said governments face a “massive conflict of interest” in parsing dangers from paint from those in drinking water because governments often own the pipes — and benefit from lawsuits accusing paint companies of damaging public health by distributing lead-based products.

If governments don’t own the pipelines mandates may have put lead in the ground as in Milwaukee.

“If it’s true lead paint is a danger then lead in water is a danger too” Edwards said. “Anyone who says it’s 90 percent lead paint is being overly simplistic at best and deceitful at its worst.”

Paying For Replacements

Al-Mujaahid wants his home’s lead service line replaced but a question looms: Who would pay? Homeowners in Milwaukee and most Wisconsin municipalities own the portion of service lines from the curb stop to the home. Municipalities are responsible for only the portion between the curb stop and water main. State law bars municipal workers from performing private construction projects and partial service line replacements can worsen lead exposure .

A 2017 Wisconsin law allows utilities to subsidize private-side replacements. Grants provided by a utility can’t eclipse more than half of the replacement cost of the private service line side but utilities may also provide loans and some piece together state and federal grants.

Milwaukee in recent years mandated replacements for lead pipes found to be disrupted or leaking — and those that serve private schools and child care providers. For mandated replacements a city cost-sharing program limits the tab for participating property owners to $1843. Properties with more than four units are not eligible for cost sharing for required replacements. Also ineligible for the subsidy: Milwaukee property owners who choose to replace service lines when not required. They must pay 100 percent of the bill.

Al-Mujaahid said his landlord has no interest in paying for a new pipeline and Al-Mujaahid doesn’t want to pay for work on a property that he doesn’t own. The city should bear full responsibility for the lead pipelines it mandated decades ago he said. “It’s their responsibility not mine.”

Since 2017 Milwaukee’s utility says it has swapped out 3881 pipelines. Advocates want more urgency to replace the remaining 70000.

“There’s no excuse at this point for the situation we find ourselves in today. It’s criminal” said Robert Miranda a spokesperson for the Milwaukee-based Freshwater for Life Action Coalition. “What is happening in Milwaukee is a crime against humanity is a crime against our public health and people need to be held accountable.”

But Karen Dettmer Milwaukee Water Works superintendent sees “good progress” in replacements and called Milwaukee’s drinking water program “one of the best in the nation.” She cited the utility’s compliance with EPA’s embattled Lead and Copper Rule since the 1990s  when it began running corrosion control chemicals through its pipes. Still Dettmer said she understands calls to pick up the pace on replacements.

“The overwhelming interest of the elected officials in the city of Milwaukee would be to replace the lead service lines as quickly as possible” Dettmer told Wisconsin Watch. “But at the same time they share my concerns about the cost to the ratepayers and the cost to property owners.”

Full Replacement Costs $800M

Replacing public and private portions of every Milwaukee lead service line would cost about $800 million  the city estimates. That’s the equivalent of more than half of the city’s entire 2021 budget  which includes $4 million in pipeline aid to property owners to replace 1100 lead service lines.

Barrett has suggested earmarking tens of millions of pandemic stimulus funds for fixing lead paint hazards and he’s waiting to see whether Biden’s infrastructure bill will deliver additional funding for pipeline replacement. That could determine how the city prioritizes its federal dollars he said in May .

The $1 trillion U.S. Senate-approved version of Biden’s proposal includes $15 billion for pipeline replacements nationwide . The bill faces an uncertain future in the House where Democrats in the majority are pushing for a bigger bill. Biden originally proposed $45 billion for pipelines.

But funding alone may not eliminate all obstacles for overhauling Milwaukee’s pipeline system. Eying an aging workforce and challenges of finding qualified replacement workers amid a labor shortage Dettmer says retaining enough employees to significantly speed up service line replacements won’t be easy.

“We have a number of retirements that have come in the past few years” she said adding that the city is pushing for workforce development resources. “We have retirees that we watch very closely that are coming to their 35 years of service at the city and we anticipate that they will take advantage of that retirement opportunity.”

Lead-Free Pipes In Some Cities

Some Wisconsin cities have already replaced all of their lead pipelines. Madison was the nation’s first utility to do so — a $19.4 million project that took a decade to complete beginning in 2001. The city originally had 8000 lead service lines a fraction of Milwaukee’s inventory and homeowners paid about 20 percent of the cost. Madison launched the effort after violating EPA lead standards and deciding that the alternative solution — running orthophosphate an anti-corrosive through the pipes — would pollute Madison’s lakes worsening algae blooms.

As the old lead service line is pulled from the ground the replacement pipeline is pulled into place where the old pipe sat then it is connected to the water main.

Green Bay joined Madison’s lead-free ranks last October when it finished a five-year effort to replace all 1782 utility-owned and 247 privately-owned lead lines. The price tag: $6.2 million for public-side replacements and $1.2 million on the private side. Water rate increases federal grants and state grants funded the project. To initiate a pipeline replacement homeowners contacted a private contractor and applied to the utility to cover the full cost.

“I’ve worked on committees and national committees too where you could probably never cost-justify a total lead service replacement program over maybe putting chemicals in” said Nancy Quirk Green Bay Water Utility general manager. “But we felt very strongly that we wanted to get rid of the source of the lead that we did not want to put additional phosphorus loadings into the Fox River — that were already having dead zones and cyanotoxins growing.”

Some property owners initially resisted seeking to avoid the disruption of pipeline work Quirk said. But the city eventually required all property owners to work with the utility to swap out any lead pipelines threatening to fine those who did not comply. Green Bay also faced challenges mapping which pipelines contained lead and keeping workers safe during the pandemic Quirk added.

Spurred by Flint’s water crisis Eau Claire has replaced hundreds of its 1266 lead service lines since 2017 and has a goal to finish by 2023. A city ordinance requires the replacement of lead lines when they are encountered and residents of older neighborhoods — especially those built before the 1940s — can apply for a replacement. DNR funding allows the utility which is canvassing neighborhoods to promote the program to directly pay contractors up to $2600 per service line leaving any additional cost to homeowners. Lane Berg utilities manager for the city said homeowners typically bear no cost.

Montana Birt of Montana and Son Grading shows the worn-down protective coating of an old lead service pipe on June 29 2021. The pipeline was removed from a home in Eau Claire Wis. as part of a citywide initiative to replace potentially hazardous lead pipelines with those made of copper or plastic.

“The biggest thing I see on the program — the improvement — is when the city started reimbursing the contractor directly” Montana Birt of Montana and Son Grading told Wisconsin Watch during a pipeline replacement in Eau Claire. “That way it takes all the burden off of the homeowner.”

But in Milwaukee Al-Mujaahid has lost faith that his home’s lead pipeline will be removed. The family is contemplating leaving — to protect the health of their children and to escape a starkly segregated city that’s among the most difficult places in the country for African-American residents to succeed according to some studies.

“My thing is to just get up out of here” he said. “Minimally somewhere without these lead lines. Ideally out of this country.”

She boarded Flight 77 and never made it home.

SAN ANTONIO — The life and work of a doctor born and raised in San Antonio was cut short in the 9/11 attacks.

Dora Menchaca was an epidemiologist working with a company Amgen developing a prostate cancer treatment that earned her a meeting with the FDA in Washington DC 20 years ago.

Her meetings were cut short and she booked a flight on American Airlines Flight 77 to see her family but like many never made it home.

According to the Pentagon Memorial website Menchaca worked at Amgen’s Thousand Oaks headquarters since 1991.

20 years later the feelings are unchanged for her family across the country.

“It was just a very eerie feeling to think those emotions are still there. Emotions of sadness” John Menchaca Dora’s younger brother said.

Menchaca and his siblings were born and raised on the west side of San Antonio.

Her older sister Dora went to Providence High School in San Antonio graduating in the class of 1973. The campus minister wrote a prayer in Menchaca's memory.

Today we remember our Provet sister Dora Menchaca ‘73 who passed away on September 11 2001. She was on American... Posted by Providence Catholic School on Saturday September 11 2021

Even while attending undergrad at the University of Notre Dame she was helping her brother when he was doing summer school homework.

“I don’t think I would’ve reached the level of education I have without her being right there next to my side through those early years” he recalls.

Her educational path led her to her husband Earl Dorsey meeting him when they both attended UCLA.

Dorsey says he admired her passion for others and remembers how dedicated she was to her research.

“She was trying to get some approval on a product that was going to help with prostate cancer” Dorsey said.

“They were trying to get FDA approval and that meeting got cut short she was supposed to return on Wednesday. The meeting got cut short for a variety of reasons and she caught the first plane back to LA” Dorsey said because it was an early flight Dora was going to text that she made the flight.

Menchaca wanted to see her husband and four-year-old son in their Santa Monica home.

“She loved purple roses and she had started a garden in our backyard and she promised to plant roses [with our son] when she got back” Dorsey says.

While watching the events unfolding in New York Dorsey gets a call from Dora’s mother and relatives in San Antonio.

“Nothing at that point had been reported about the Pentagon. I’m telling her ‘that’s all in New York. That’s somewhere else she’s okay.’ So when the reality hit that this plane hit [the Pentagon] and they flashed the flight number that’s when I knew” Dorsey said.

The tragedy shut air travel down across the country. Their daughter Imani attending the University of Portland had friends arrange for her to drive home after the attack. Dorsey waited three days before telling his youngest son that mom wasn’t coming home.

Menchaca recalls how his sister was passionate about family getting regular health screenings. Her research didn’t stop at work.

“I happened to contract hepatitis A from something I ate down in Mexico…and within a day she found out that I had contracted [it] she was on the phone with the health department” Menchaca says.

Menchaca says she also took great pride in coming from a Latino background.

“She was very involved in talking to school age high school age girls about the opportunities for Latinas in the sciences” Menchaca said.

“She was always caring about her community and wanting to see the community succeed” Menchaca adds.

Two years after her death the FBI gave Dorsey his wife’s belongings including a message from his wife.

“The note was written on the plane. It says ‘Earl I love you. Please take care of Imani and Jaryd for me’” Dorsey says.

Twenty years later Dorsey cherishes the time he can spend with his children and grandchildren.

“The legacy that she left was we only have so much time we have to make the most of every moment. And that’s the message we’ve carried within each of us that’s how we’re going to live and that’s what we’re going to remember her” Dorsey says.

Specifically a large number of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) come to fruition in the year 2021 alone and more are on the horizon.

This article will cover a slew of recently completed mergers and acquisitions and address the more significant questions like what is driving this trend and how it affects the semiconductor industry?

Recent Mergers & Acquisitions

Recently there have been three prominent M&A events:

The first noteworthy merger is Renesas' acquisition of Dialog Semiconductor. According to representatives at Renesas the investment benefits the company by allowing it to scale its IoT sector capabilities by leveraging Dialog's portfolio of low-power technologies. Specifically cited are Dialog's BLE WiFi and audio SoCs which Renesas feels complement its current MCU portfolios. Beyond this the company could benefit from an increased engineering and design scale for faster time to markets.

The second big merger of 2021 was ADI's acquisition of Maxim Integrated. The acquisition is meant to provide Analog with increased domain expertise and capabilities opening it up and positioning it well for various key market growth trends. Specifically ADI believes that Maxim's strength in the automotive and data center markets will be invaluable moving forward as it seeks to establish itself as a dominant player in both fields.

The final merger of interest is Nexperia's acquisition of NWF. Nexperia has been a customer of NWF for many years and now with the purchase it has obtained 100% ownership of the semiconductor production facility. The fab currently has a capacity of over 35000 200 mm wafer starts per month including technologies from standard MOSFETs to trench IGBTs which are a staple in Nexperia's portfolio. Beyond increased production Nexperia also feels that they benefit from NWF's significantly enhanced automotive-qualified product supply capability.

Though these companies that are on the purchasing side can stand to gain some major advantages; however why is this shift towards consolidation happening with larger and larger companies?

The Consolidation Movement

With so many non-trivial acquisitions in 2021 it's essential to ask ourselves: why is this happening? There probably is not one ""right"" answer but in general there are a couple of things to be said.

One explanation is that the market has become increasingly competitive since the turn of the century. In 2008 the top 10 semiconductor companies collectively controlled ~46% of the market share while the rest of the industry controlled the other ~54%.

Fast forward over a decade to 2020 and it seems that today the top 10 semiconductor companies own a collective 55% of the market with the rest of the industry controlling 45%.

This shift could mean that the industry as a whole has been moving towards consolidation with more and more market share being controlled by the big players over time.

One setback with this shift is that it can make it increasingly difficult for smaller companies to gain a significant foothold on their own hence leading to a need for consolidation (i.e. mergers and acquisitions). To compete in today's market companies often need to have a combination of breadth and depth in their product offerings which is nearly impossible to achieve without the large scales and diversity that come with mergers.

Overall this movement towards consolidation could have some effects on the semiconductor industry.

Effects of Consolidation

People who favor this market trend could believe that consolidation allows for better product offerings that work more cohesively. Instead of purchasing MCUs from one company SoCs from another and power solutions from a third it may be beneficial if one company could provide all three solutions. In this scheme systems design and component integration can become significantly easier since all components were designed to work together.

On the other hand this trend could seem a bit concerning for proponents of a free market.

The theory is if a select few groups own all the market share there will be less competition in the long run leading to decreased diversity innovation and consumer choice. While this point-of-view may seem a little Orwellian Moore's Law is a law of economics driven by competition and if that competition dwindles then innovation may as well.

This trend is already seeming to take shape in the lack of new companies becoming major players in the industry. Today's narrative is that a new innovative company will eventually be bought out and absorbed into the auspices of some larger semiconductor giant. Instead 50 years ago that innovative company may have grown into a semiconductor giant in its own right.

Overall recent years have seen an increase in consolidation in the semiconductor industry a trend that is expected to continue in the near future. While this trend could be alarming to some and welcomed by others only time will tell what ramifications it holds.

To date after numerous revisions it is safe to say that it has succeeded on the former but not so much on the latter. The smartphone industry’s move to kill the analog headphone jack intentionally pushed consumers towards wireless headphones—meaning we now rely more on Bluetooth for audio than ever before.

Despite its proliferation Bluetooth often seems frustratingly unreliable. It has a short range and you might encounter problems with devices not pairing or reconnecting. Other annoyances that may crop up include random disconnections interruptions or interference from other devices. Switching from one source to another can be hit or miss plus there’s varying behavior from devices due to different implementations of Bluetooth features. Here’s why Bluetooth has so many problems and what you can do to work around them.

What affects Bluetooth reliability?

Bluetooth connections still aren’t as solid as we’d like and things get even trickier when you introduce features like Bluetooth multipoint.

Bluetooth wasn’t originally intended for audio. The standard was created in the mid-90s as a secure way to wirelessly transmit data between devices and was expanded to create wireless personal area networks (WPANs). It’s now one of the most ubiquitous wireless technologies in the world according to the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG). You’ll find Bluetooth technology embedded in peripherals like keyboards and mice game controllers printers and audio devices. It employs the 2.4GHz radio frequency (RF) band for transmission which Wi-Fi and cordless phones also inhabit. It also shares frequencies used by microwaves ovens fluorescent lights (including CFL bulbs) as well as smart home devices using the Zigbee mesh network. Read on: 5 reasons you shouldn’t buy Bluetooth headphones

The 2.4GHz frequency band is part of the Industrial Scientific and Medical (ISM) zone of the RF spectrum. This area of the spectrum is attractive to equipment manufacturers as devices don’t require FCC licensing to operate in the ISM band. Because of this the ISM band is buzzing with devices all of which can interfere with your Bluetooth audio connection.

Bluetooth behavior can get patchy when the RF spectrum is crowded (in the city or at a gym).

The wireless link between cell phones speakers and headphones is categorized as Bluetooth Class 2 which has a stated range of 10 meters (33 feet) and uses up to 2.5mW of transmit power. However even communication with a Class 2 device (like a speaker) over a distance of five meters may not work particularly well since generally devices need a clear line of sight for optimal transmission—disruptions from walls doors even people can cause problems.

Bluetooth hops between different frequencies. If you move around carrier frequencies can drop off requiring some re-profiling of the connection. This happens automatically but can make the audio choppy momentarily or may even interrupt it completely. Related: True wireless vs wireless Bluetooth

The biggest problem is that several wireless protocols are competing for bandwidth including all of your 2.4GHz Wi-Fi devices. Bluetooth transfers data much slower than Wi-Fi does. Under ideal conditions 2.4GHz Wi-Fi will support up to 600Mbps. Bluetooth 5 offers data transfer speeds of up to 2Mbps—double the rate supported by Bluetooth 4.2 but still a tiny fraction of Wi-Fi transfer speeds. Even with the speed improvement Bluetooth 5 will be slow to correct if data gets lost compared to Wi-Fi and thus more prone to dropouts and glitches.

Why doesn’t your Bluetooth device pair reliably?

On Android auto-pairing and connecting is a breeze and there’s even a dropdown to display battery information in the notifications.

Bluetooth has a relatively complex handshaking protocol which can fail if there is corruption of any data packet exchanged during the process. In this case the handshake has to start over which slows down the pairing process.

The process for pairing devices can vary. It might involve entering a PIN code into your phone or computer particularly with older peripherals. Thankfully newer products have moved on from this approach. With many you can use Near Field Communication (NFC) and physically touch your phone to the device you want to pair it with—this feature is common on Android devices.

Generally Bluetooth is backwards compatible: Bluetooth devices supporting the current Bluetooth 5.X standard should still be able to pair with devices using older versions of the standard.

Audio devices are required to support a common codec called SBC so they should be able to communicate regardless of when they were made. Generally Bluetooth is backwards compatible: Bluetooth devices supporting the current Bluetooth 5.X standard should still be able to pair with devices using older versions of the standard. If you run into problems make sure your phone is running the newest version of its operating system.

Some accessories save pairing addresses from previously paired devices but there’s a limit to the number of devices’ information that they can store. So if you run into trouble pairing headphones or a speaker that has been paired to devices in the past it may need a reset to clear the pairing memory. Search online for how to reset your specific model.

How can you increase Bluetooth reliability?

Lily Katz / SoundGuys Sticking to one manufacturer’s products can improve Bluetooth reliability.

If you want to improve the reliability of your Bluetooth connection there are a few things you can do: Keep devices as close together as possible when in use. Removing your phone from your pocket (or bag) can also improve the connection.

Try to keep your distance from other 2.4GHz RF sources like Wi-Fi routers and smart home devices.

Keep your devices updated—many headphones have an app that will allow you to make firmware updates.

Bluetooth transmission can be affected when lots of applications run simultaneously on the source device. Close unnecessary applications.

It’s unnecessary to stream high bit-rate audio files over Bluetooth and this can cause skips or glitches. There’s no need for Hi-Res source files. An important consideration when making purchasing decisions is to stick to devices within the same brand/ecosystem for the best results (e.g. don’t mix Apple and Samsung products). A few companies have begun to take matters into their own hands by developing technology that works a lot like Bluetooth but with bespoke refinements.

For example Apple’s H1 chip enables its AirPods to intelligently switch to whatever device you’re using rather than having to unpair and re-pair with devices each time. Apple’s exclusive chip also optimizes audio streaming for listeners using AirPods products or recent Beats headphones making connectivity more stable and reliable. This all works well if you’re using Apple’s products at both ends of the connection. Meanwhile Google added Fast Pair to its Pixel Buds—a proprietary technology that allows Bluetooth devices to quickly connect using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). The Fast Pair feature is available to users with compatible Android devices.

For transmission over an analog telephone line—which was once the most popular way to access the internet—the modem converts data between analog and digital formats in real time for two-way network communication. In the case of the high-speed digital modems popular today the signal is much simpler and doesn't require the analog-to-digital conversion.

1:14 What Is a Modem in Computer Networking?

History of Modems

The first devices called modems converted digital data for transmission over analog telephone lines. The speed of these modems was measured in baud (a unit of measurement named after Emile Baudot) although as computer technology developed these measures were converted into bits per second. The first commercial modems supported a speed of 110 bps and were used by the U.S. Department of Defense news services and some large businesses.

Modems gradually became familiar to consumers in the late 1970s through the 1980s as public message boards and news services like CompuServe were built on early internet infrastructure. Then with the explosion of the World Wide Web in the mid and late 1990s dial-up modems emerged as the primary form of internet access in many households around the world.

Dial-Up Modems

Modems used on dial-up networks convert data between the analog form used on telephone lines and the digital form used on computers. An external dial-up modem plugs into a computer at one end and a telephone line on the other end. In the past some computer makers integrated internal dial-up modems into the computer.

Modern dial-up network modems transmit data at a maximum rate of 56000 bits per second. However the inherent limitations of public telephone networks often limit modem data rates to 33.6 Kbps or lower.

When you connect to a network through a dial-up modem the modem relays through a speaker the distinctive handshaking sounds between your device and the remote modem. Because the connection process and data patterns are similar each time hearing the sound pattern helps you verify whether the connection process is working.

Broadband Modems

A broadband modem like those used for DSL or cable internet access uses advanced signaling techniques to achieve dramatically higher network speeds than earlier-generation dial-up modems. Broadband modems are often referred to as high-speed modems. Cellular modems are a type of digital modem that establishes internet connectivity between a mobile device and a cell phone network.

The word modem is a mashup of the term modulation/demodulation which is the technical term for the conversion between digital and analog signals.

External broadband modems plug into a home broadband router or other home gateway device on one end and the external internet interface such as a cable line on the other. The router or gateway directs the signal to all the devices in the business or home as needed. Some broadband routers include an integrated modem as a single hardware unit.

Many broadband internet providers supply suitable modem hardware to their customers at no charge or for a monthly fee.",,,,,,

At 8.46am on September 11 2001 Louise Traynor was on the phone on the 101st floor of the World Trade Center in Manhattan.

She was speaking to an old friend Sarah Jane from south Armagh who had called and who was also living in New York.

“Then there was the noise” recalls Louise. “It was like a roll of thunder a rolling echoey sound and then like an enormous explosion bang.”

The South Tower of the World Trade Center in New York explodes just after Louise Traynor left the complex on the easterly side towards Church Street the side from which this picture was taken. She had only just looked back and for the first time seen smoke pouring from the North Tower right

Sitting alone in a cubicle of desks Louise stood up to look across the wider office around her.

Louise was in the south of the twin towers and the windows nearest her looked out in a southerly direction across Hudson River towards the Statue of Liberty and on towards the Atlantic (see picture on this web page).

But from her section of the 101st floor it was not possible to see the north tower which was to the northwest. Louise and no-one around her could know that a plane had just slammed into the replica skyscraper 100 or so metres away.

The 101st floor which was occupied by the insurance giant AON was far from full of people at that time. While Louise’s start time was 8.30am many other people on the floor began work from 9am.

Two pictures taken by Louise Traynor (nee Woods) placed side by side from her office in the World Trade Center complex in New York in 2001. She worked on the 101st floor of the south tower. The pics show the southerly view with the Statue of Liberty island to right of the image

None of the six people in the communications department which Louise had joined months earlier as a freelance (then becoming staff days before on September 5) was in work. Two of them including the head of department were working elsewhere.

Louise who was then aged 24 does not remember the phone chat with her friend who worked for a construction company. “There was always drama in her work” she says. Her friend later tells her that the line went dead after the bang.

“I don’t know if I put it down or disconnected. But I remember getting up to see over my computer and one woman screamed” recalls Louise. “No other noise.”

The building would sway in high winds says Louise “which you got used to. That morning the building really shook then settled”.

She walked over to some co-workers who were not in her immediate department but who sat nearby and with whom she was friendly. No-one knew what to do.

Then came signals that something was badly wrong. Louise could see paper floating outside her windows “more like ticker tape”.

She went back to get her handbag from her desk. “It was then that I smelt smoke. Obviously it was coming through the air conditioning vents.”

Louise did not know that the World Trade Center (WTC) had been bombed in 1993 because she had only been working in the complex for months. In fact she had been in America for less than a year.

Louise was living a dream. She had applied for a work visa via the lottery system and had been successful. In New York she had a brother (one of her four siblings) living in Queen’s across the East River from the towers and was able to move into a shared apartment in the Bronx with a bunch of girls she knew from Northern Ireland.

Even better an employment agency that works with Irish people had found her the temporary job at AON. Louise (nee Woods) had graduated from the University of Ulster in Communications and Marketing a few years before then worked in Dublin before flying to the States.

“I just wanted to go out there” she recalls from her sister Virginia’s house near the NI border with the Republic.

On Tuesday September 11 2001 Louise was reading Harry Potter: The Goblet of Fire which she was enjoying: “The train journey was very quick down.”

It was sunny so she crossed the plaza between the two towers to get to the south skyscraper instead of using the mall. .

Louise would lose her Harry Potter book that day. Much worse she would soon lose colleagues.

And she came within a whisker of losing her own life.

But in those moments after the first plane struck it was that smell of smoke that made Louise sense there was danger.

She thinks it is the fact that she grew up in Northern Ireland that made her deduce there had been a bomb down below perhaps in a building nearby. WTC was near to the Wall Street financial district. “I was thinking a bomb had caused papers to blow up.”

Louise went back with her handbag to co-workers including her friend Tara an American of a similar age. “Tara said: ‘People are leaving’.”

Louise was keen to get out as was another colleague called Leonard (Len). “I was thinking it is a long way down. If there is a fire we need to get out.”

Still no-one in the company or in the building had ordered them out.

Across the entire WTC complex people were coming to learn that something catastrophic had happened in the north tower — a passenger airline had slammed deliberately into that nearby tower hitting it at floors numbered in the 90s a similar height to the AON offices the parallel tower in which Louise was now standing.

Hundreds of people had been killed instantly in the blast on the plane and in the worst affected towers. Hundreds more were burning or choking to death. And hundreds more were trapped (not a single person lived from level 92 and up in the north tower almost everyone in level 91 and below escaped).

Louise and her colleagues moved to the windowless core of their floor where the was a inter-section of two long corridors three lifts and three stairwells.

A crowd of people had already built up at the lifts. This meant a queue and delay.

Len the most anxious of the group led the way into one of the stairwells. “He was saying I need to get home to my family” recalls Louise. “I just said to the [two other] girls come on.”

They all started walking down.

“The other girls were saying: ‘I didn’t even get telling my boss we’re leaving’. I said everyone is leaving we will go across for a tea or coffee and then come back they’ll understand.”

Louise remembers people coming down from above. There was a stream of people on the narrow stairs. No-one was in panic — or almost no-one. But during their descent Louise passed an older woman crying on the stairs and being comforted by another woman.

“Tara said this must remind them of the bombing here.”

It was the first Louise had heard of the 1993 terror attack which damaged the base of the towers.

But unknown to anyone in Louise’s group some people in the south tower with windows overlooking the north tower had just had an up-close view out on to a hellish scene of an inferno in that neighbouring skyscraper and of people flinging themselves out of the fire and into a certain death 1000 feet below.

Len was now ahead so far ahead they lost sight of him. The group all came out of an open door on to floor 78 lobby which was where the express lifts down to the lobby and the local lifts met.

“There were people on their phone standing with coffees or getting on the elevators.”

Louise does not know the exact timings but she probably began her descent some time after 850am and travelled down the 23 stories to 78 in under 10 minutes. “You could now see concern on people’s faces” says Louise of the scene on 78.

But while there was now a sense of urgency there was none of hysteria there would have been had people known that another passenger jet was coming straight at them soon to slam right into floor 78 (and impacting up to 84).

“That’s when the announcement came” says of being on 78.

Louise did not even know there was a tannoy she had never heard such messages previously.

“It said the building is safe please return to your offices.”

This message has later been explained by the fact that even then many people in security did not know the collision in the north tower had been deliberate. All they knew was the debris falling and that if the thousands of people in the south tower fled in a panic they might stray straight into danger. “I did see people listening to the announcement turning round and talking about it.”

Confused by the announcement Louise’s friend Tara hesitated. “She kinda looked at me but I said no no we’re this far now we’re going down.”

The doors on an express lift down were closing and Louise barged in bringing Tara and the other woman co-worker with her.

“I remember there was an older man in a suit who wasn’t very impressed with me pushing on but I just pushed on to get in.”

The lift which held perhaps 50 people and was the size of a small room was full.

At the bottom in the huge lobby of the south tower two security men were directing people right

“Usually there were people milling about queuing to get in. But there was no-one around The two guys were just going: ‘Out. Out’.”

The guards were directing them to the subterranean shopping mall instead of left into daylight and out on to a road called Liberty Street. Louise noticed in the mall that the shops were already closed.

The News Letter has watched videos of the mall which suggests it takes about a minute to cross to the east side of the WTC complex in the mall. This tells us that Louise was a minute or so from death.

Because as she exited into she thinks Church Street which had a major store called Century 21 Louise had time to look back.

This was the first time that she saw the north tower first to be hit covered in black smoke.

“Everything was grey. There were mounds of dust on the street lots of papers smoke It was like a war zone.” This was debris from the first plane’s impact.

Then Louise heard an approaching roaring plane.

In the confusion caused by echoes from the surrounding tall buildings Louise did not know where it was coming but ran.

“You have no view. I could see people across the road looking up.”

She recalls thinking: “Where do I go to get away from this. I thought this was the end. I remember screaming out my mummy’s name.”

Then the United Airlines second passenger jet flew straight into the north tower She doesn’t know if she fell or was knocked off her feet but Louise stumbled in terror to a small abandoned lorry on the street and ducked under it with another man. The two never said anything to each other and Louise later noticed that she had oil on her clothes. “You could see the feet of people running past.”

Louise then saw Tara. “She was in an awful state because her brother worked in the other tower.”

They took shelter in a shop before being ordered out of it and heading towards friends of Tara’s who were staying in a hotel the middle of the city near Grand Central station. They went there by a subway line that was still running.

On TV in the hotel she saw footage of the attacks but it was not yet 9.59am when her south tower collapsed (the second tower to be hit was first to fall).

Louise got access to a phone and could only remember her friend Sarah Jane’s number and called asking her to let her parents in Armagh know she was OK. She also let her brother’s wife know she was well.

“My family had been watching not knowing what tower I was in. They were thinking please God let it be tower two. They knew I was in the 101st floor. Then the south tower was hit. Mummy was at work and heard it over the radio and was sure I was dead.”

After trying to get a phone message home Louise “wanted to get out of the city. There were reports of lots more planes coming”.

She got a train home to the Bronx.

“I was at home before I knew the towers had collapsed.”

Louise’s urge to dash home was influenced by growing up in NI in the Troubles. “Mum and dad had told us when anything happens get out of there get home to safety.”

Louise had been on one of the south tower last lifts down to safety. Scores of people were killed on level 78 waiting for the lifts by the plane impact.

An estimated 200 people were killed in lifts themselves (almost all of the 100+ elevators in WTC were made inoperable by the jet impacts and almost everyone trapped inside remained there until the towers collapsed).

In fact if Louise had even been in the lobby as she exited the lifts she might have been killed too. The plane impacts sent fireballs down the lift shafts which exploded out on some levels including the lobbies burning people alive at ground level.

No-one in Louise’s immediate communications team of six died but Len (Leonard Snyder) was never seen again. Like so many people who died no-one knows exactly where he was when the towers toppled or how exactly he died. Louise does not believe he returned to the office after the tannoy announcement as others died because he had been too determined to get out.

Len left a widow and two young children.

“There were other people who died I knew their faces.”

AON lost 175 people.

“I went to a lot of memorial services.”

Around 600 people died in those upper floors of the south tower.

Ironically Louise recounts all this in front of a poster of a football top with AON as sponsors something she had not even noticed on the wall. “The company was very good” she says. “They offered counselling.”

But she did not find it much help.

Louise flew home to Ulster after the attacks to see her relatives then returned to New York. “I loved America.”

But the city did not have the same allure after the attacks “It was never what it was before September 11.”

Louise herself was never again as care free. “It changed me as a person.”

For a long while she “would have flashbacks nightmares of being trapped in the buildings having to jump or get burnt”.

It is only now 20 years later that Louise feels able to talk about it all in such depth. She stayed in New York for a few years but it was not the same. She met a man from Armagh Paul out there in October 2001 and they came home in 2006 after a year in Australia to get married. They have John 11 and Kate 8 living back in south Armagh (“they are great”).

Louise would like to go back to New York to see the memorial but she now thinks when she sees the news that America has “become very separated”.

Asked if she sees herself as damaged she says:

“I probably would have seen myself as damaged. Now I don’t.

“It shaped the person I am now. For a long time I was angry that I had to go through that.

“Now I realise it has made me a stronger person in terms of what’s important. Material things don’t matter.

“What makes me happy is my family my children simple things.”

• Louise loved her job at AON (pictured on this web page is one of her 2001 WTC security passes) loved living in a big city with old friends liked her colleagues and even enjoyed her commute — a bus to the subway then because it was the far end of the line a guaranteed seat on the train which took her all the way to a station near WTC from where she would walk to a bank of elevators that whisked her up first to level 78 (in an express lift) then to level 101 (in a lift that stopped at different floors).

“I loved working in the towers. It was always sunny and I had views out over the Statue of Liberty” says Louise. “I was loving life couldn’t have been happier.”

I went to Caltech and all I got was this T-shirt ... and a new way to discover complex and interesting materials.

Coupling computer automation with an ink-jet printer originally used to print T-shirt designs researchers at Caltech and Google have developed a high-throughput method of identifying novel materials with interesting properties. In a trial run of the process they screened hundreds of thousands of possible new materials and discovered one made from cobalt tantalum and tin that has tunable transparency and acts as a good catalyst for chemical reactions while remaining stable in strong acid electrolytes.

The effort described in a scientific article published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences(PNAS) was led by John Gregoire and Joel Haber of Caltech and Lusann Yang of Google. It builds on research conducted at the Joint Center for Artificial Photosynthesis (JCAP) a Department of Energy (DOE) Energy Innovation Hub at Caltech and continues with JCAP's successor the Liquid Sunlight Alliance (LiSA) a DOE-funded effort that aims to streamline the complicated steps needed to convert sunlight into fuels to make that process more efficient.

Creating new materials is not as simple as dropping a few different elements into a test tube and shaking it up to see what happens. You need the elements that you combine to bond with each other at the atomic level to create something new and different rather than just a heterogeneous mixture of ingredients. With a nearly infinite number of possible combinations of the various squares on the periodic table the challenge is knowing which combinations will yield such a material.

""Materials discovery can be a bleak process. If you can't predict where to find the desired properties you could spend your entire career mixing random elements and never find anything interesting"" says Gregoire research professor of applied physics and materials science researcher at JCAP and LiSA team lead.

When combining a small number of individual elements materials scientists can often make predictions about what properties a new material might have based on its constituent parts. However that process quickly becomes untenable when more complicated mixtures are made.

""Anything more than two elements is considered 'high dimensional' in materials science"" Gregoire says. ""Most or all of the one- and two-metal oxides are already known"" he says. ""The unknown frontier is three or more together."" (Metal oxides are solid materials that contain positively charged metal ions or cations and negatively charged oxygen ions or anions; rust for example is iron oxide.)

Most of the materials in Earth's crust are metal oxides because the oxygen in the atmosphere reacts with various metals in the crust of the planet. The environmental stability of metal oxides makes them practically useful provided that specific compositions of such oxides can be identified that will provide the mechanical optical electronic and chemical properties needed for a given technology.

Although materials scientists have shown how all of these properties can be tuned through the use of various metal oxides achieving the necessary properties for a particular application can require specific combinations of multiple elements and finding the right ones is a daunting challenge.

To broach the three-or-more-metal-oxide frontier Gregoire's group drew on a decade's worth of work by JCAP. There researchers have developed methods to create 100000 materials per day. One such material—discovered in this study—was produced by using repurposed ink-jet printers to ""print"" new materials onto glass sheets. Each combination of elements was printed as a line with a gradation of the ratio between its constituents and then oxidized at high temperature.

Each of those materials was then scanned and imaged at Caltech using a hyperspectral imaging technique co-developed with Google that can quickly capture information about the material by recording how much light it absorbs at nine different wavelengths. ""It's not a comprehensive analysis of the material but it's rapid and offers clues to the compositions with interesting properties"" says Haber research chemist and material engineer at JCAP and LiSA.

In all the Caltech team created 376752 three-metal-oxide combinations based on 10 metal elements and produced samples of each individual combination 10 different times to detect and weed out any flaws in the synthesis process. ""The printing can have artifacts which is the sacrifice you make for speed. Analyses by Google taught us to make everything 10 times to build trust in the results"" Gregoire says.

Though imperfect the process creates three-metal materials about 1000 times faster than traditional techniques such as vapor deposition in which the new material is coated onto a substrate by condensing it from a vapor.

Google computer engineers then created algorithms to process the hyperspectral images and searched for specific compositions whose optical properties can only be explained by chemical interactions among the three metal elements.

""If the three elements chemically interact to provide exceptional optical properties their interactions may also give rise to other exceptional properties"" Gregoire explains. Because the technique can identify the small fraction of compositions that show evidence of these chemical interactions it also narrows down the haystack for materials scientists searching for needles so to speak.

""John's lab had the sort of problem we dream about at Google Applied Science; he can print hundreds of thousands of samples in a day resulting in terabytes of image data"" says Google researcher Lusann Yang. ""We were delighted to work closely with him at every step of this six-year collaboration finding places to apply Google's unique toolkit for iterative experiments on large quantities of noisy data: designing experiments debugging hardware processing large amounts of image data and creating physics-inspired algorithms. The result is an experimental data set of unique breadth across many chemical spaces that I'm proud to open source.""

To validate their findings Gregoire's team at Caltech recreated the materials flagged as ""interesting"" using physical vapor deposition and analyzed them using X-ray diffraction a slower but more thorough process than hyperspectral imaging. This type of validation revealed that the automated high-throughput process was more adept at spotting new materials than a thorough analysis of the hyperspectral data by a human scientist.

Richter of Caltech; and Zan Armstrong Samuel J. Yang (BS '11) Christopher Roat Nicholas Wagner Marc Coram (BS '97) Marc Berndl and Patrick Riley of Google.

The impact of the global shortage of semiconductors on the automotive industry is gathering momentum with manufacturers not only scrambling to adjust production but shortages of finished vehicle inventory now seriously impacting on demand fulfilment. OEMs are unable to replenish stock at dealers and customers may be avoiding showrooms because of rising vehicle prices either putting off purchases or shifting to the used vehicle market.

Meanwhile there is no immediate relief expected from chip manufacturers even as many expand production capacity specifically for automotive customers. The lead time for this supply to reach the market still appears to be more than six months or longer away.

OEMs have struggled with supply since the end of 2020 with the issue gradually worsening in Europe and North America and increasingly impacting plants and OEMs in Asia particularly following issues at suppliers in South-East Asia. Up until the second half of the year most OEMs and dealers were able to meet demand recovery from excess vehicle inventory while most manufacturers have expected to make up for most lost production by the end of the year or early into 2022. Meanwhile OEMs have taken measures to prioritise production of higher profit vehicles over those with lower margins as well as removing certain electronic features from vehicles to allow production to continue.

But now the scale of lost production volumes looks too high to avoid serious impacts on sales volumes. IHS Markit forecasted that up to 7.1m light vehicles will not be produced globally because of the chip shortage estimates released before OEMs such as Toyota revealed further cuts this summer and autumn.

AutoForecast Solutions which has become an analyst of record for tracking the impact of the chip shortage in the automotive sector now estimates that the global automotive industry will see a loss in output of 8.5m passenger vehicles and light trucks because of the chip shortage nearly double its forecast of 4.57m in late June. AFS expects 2.58m units of lost output in North America and more than 2.5m lost in Europe (see table).

In the space of one week in September AutoForecast Solutions increased its forecast for lost output by nearly 450000 units following further divergences between actual and planned production according to Sam Fiorani vice-president at the firm. “General Motors losses increased by 86000 primarily in the United States and Canada. Renault-Nissan has been especially hard hit in the United States with nearly 265000 vehicles currently expected to be lost this year. Stellantis took large hits in North America and Western Europe across numerous plants. Maruti Suzuki [in India] and Volkswagen were also adjusted with more losses planned.”

Production losses are now translating into significant year-on-year declines in new vehicle registrations. New vehicle sales in the US fell by 17% year-on-year in August with low vehicle inventory and rises prices choking off demand. European markets saw similar declines in August with the German market falling year-on-year by 23% the UK by 22% and France by 15% respectively. August is a traditionally slower month for vehicle sales while August 2020 saw recovery in many of these markets following lockdowns however the declines bring volumes well below pre-Covid levels.

There are multiple reasons for the decline including economic uncertainty with the spread of the Delta variant of Covid-19 along with adjustments in government support in some markets. However there is little to suggest that underlying demand for personal mobility has significantly weakened but rather that waiting times and prices are impacting customer decisions.

Jaguar Land Rover dealers in the UK and EU for example told Automotive Logistics that current lead times for new models were now between 6 to 12 months. At Volkswagen while supply of its new ID.3 and ID.4 electric vehicles were relatively healthy dealers said waiting times were around five months for many new models.

The low supply has also disrupted purchasing habits in the US as well where it has become significantly more difficult to purchase new vehicles off dealer lots and more customers needed to buy a ‘build-to-order’ basis.

The chip crisis has forced dealers to sell virtually all new inventory and many are currently pushing sales of ‘nearly new’ models – if they can get their hands on used vehicles that is.

Vehicle residual values are at very high levels because of second-hand vehicle shortages and high demand.

Waiting on a chip

Supply of chips will only balance with demand when manufacturers have been able to increase production capacity. Officials in Taiwan have sought to reassure automakers that chip makers in the country are doing everything they can to alleviate the crunch. Wang Mei-hua the country’s economy minister told Reuters in August that chip production in the country should find balance by the fourth quarter of this year.

However Jochen Hanebeck the chief operating officer of German chipmaker Infineon has warned that the lead time for foundries to increase capacity could easily take until 2023. Top executives at Daimler BMW and Volkswagen meanwhile have all recently said that shortages were expected to impact production and sales well into 2022. Chip prices have risen by more than 20% in some cases.

The European Commission continues to push for local investment and production of semiconductors in Europe. Chipmakers are responding: Qualcomm Intel and Applied Materials have each highlighted ongoing efforts to boost production in Europe. Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon said that his company is open to working with foundries in Europe. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger announced plans to establish capacity for automotive chips at its foundry in Ireland with plans to invest up to €80 billion ($94.5 billion) in Europe and open two new chip plants over the next decade. Applied Materials the company that makes tooling to produce semiconductors has released two new tools to help efficiency in making chips for electric vehicles.

The Biden Administration in the US has set out similar ambitions to localise more manufacturing and here too many chip manufacturers are making significant investments.

But with dealers and OEMs depleting inventory and no immediate chance for replenishment it looks increasingly likely that sales volumes will feel the drag well into 2022. As both prices and lead times for new cars increase more potential buyers will be swayed to remarketed vehicles notably the ‘nearly new’ segment which are sold with OEM warranties. Meanwhile a ramp up in electric vehicle and plug-in hybrid production and strong purchase and tax incentives have pushed more customers towards electrified vehicles. Volkswagen has even launched a small-scale subscription model in Germany called AutoAbo for its ID.3 and ID.4 electric vehicles.

However these increases in EV demand will not be enough to correct shortfalls elsewhere notably for high-margin luxury vehicles or pickup trucks in the US. And in the medium term the supply crunch for the electric vehicle supply chain notably for batteries may be worse.

There is nevertheless scope for new vehicle sales to bounce back once supply and demand are realigned however it is unlikely that sales will recover enough to warrant making up for the scale of lost production in 2021 especially with the rush to used vehicles.

“So much of the current demand for vehicles is being absorbed by the used car market that we are seeing record prices for pre-owned vehicles. If not for the used car market draining off some of the demand sales of new vehicles could easily top records once the supply has recovered” says AutoForecast’s Fiorani. However he and others expect recovery once the chip issues are resolved over the next two years.

There is likely to be considerable pent-up demand after all and OEMs may again be rushing to make up for some lost demand. The risk for the supply chain is yet another bullwhip with high demand and a race to produce putting yet more pressure on supply and prices. Pressure on logistics and material capacity is likely to remain a constant for some time yet.",,,,,,,,,

The wider IT industry has been struggling with supply chain issues since the Covid-19 pandemic with semiconductors increasingly hard to come by. Other components have also been impacted.

Gallagher's Recent Short Interest - Arthur J. Gallagher (NYSE:AJG),"Loading... Loading...

Arthur J. Gallagher's AJG short percent of float has risen 5.71% since its last report. The company recently reported that it has 2.11 million shares sold short which is 1.11% of all regular shares that are available for trading. Based on its trading volume it would take traders 2.65 days to cover their short positions on average.

Why Short Interest Matters

Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.

Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.

Il représente actuellement 177% du PIB du pays et joue un rôle stratégique à la fois géographique et socio-économique assurant la sécurité et la défense nationales. Pourtant le changement climatique est déjà à l’œuvre et met en danger l’existence du ""premier grenier à riz"" du Vietnam en témoignent notamment le niveau des crues et la fréquence des crues.

Les projections pour la région sont inquiétantes. D’ici 2050 le niveau de la mer pourrait monter de 10 cm par an. Sans mesure ni intervention d’ici 2100 la montée des eaux pourrait inonder 40% de la superficie du delta du Mékong et influencer les moyens de subsistance de 55% de ses habitants menaçant ainsi la sécurité alimentaire nationale et régionale.

Projections inquiétantes

Lê Anh Tuân expert de l’Institut de recherche sur le changement climatique relevant de l’Université de Cân Tho a indiqué que les crues tardives dans le delta du Mékong déclencheraient une grave intrusion saline provoquant un impact énorme sur la production agricole et les moyens d’existence de la population locale.

Le Pr.-Dr. Dào Xuân Hoc président de l’Association vietnamienne de développement des ressources en eau (VIWARDA) a déclaré que l’une des principales raisons des érosions et des changements négatifs le long des rivières et des côtes de la région était le manque d’alluvions.

""Les centrales hydroélectriques situées dans le cours supérieur du Mékong ont un impact négatif sur les conditions météorologiques de la région. La quantité d’alluvions et de sable dans le delta devrait plonger entraînant ainsi une grave érosion côtière"" a expliqué Nguyên Huu Thiên un autre expert de l’écosystème de cette région.

Trois axes d’actions

Étant donnée la position stratégique que revêt le delta du Mékong dans la défense et le développement socio-économique du pays les spécialistes estiment qu’il est essentiel de promouvoir dès aujourd’hui une adaptation efficace de la région au changement climatique.

Le projet de planification du delta du Mékong pour la période 2021-2030 et vision 2050 récemment publié pour recueillir les opinions du public le considère non seulement comme un défi mais aussi comme une opportunité pour le développement régional.

Le vice-ministre du Plan et de l’Investissement Trân Quôc Phuong a indiqué que ce projet présentait trois axes d’actions principales.

Le premier est de respecter les lois de la nature au lieu d’y intervenir profondément endommageant l’environnement et les écosystèmes. Il s’agit donc de s’adapter de manière proactive au changement climatique et de considérer l’eau salée et l’eau saumâtre comme des ressources au développement.

Le second est de considérer le changement climatique non seulement comme un défi mais aussi comme une opportunité de changer les modèles de production et de réorganiser l’espace de développement régional de manière efficace et durable.

Le troisième est de changer la pensée sur la sécurité alimentaire. Il faut alors aligner la pêche la culture fruitière et la production de riz sur la demande des marchés ; développer une agriculture de plus haute qualité en combinaison avec les services l’écotourisme et l’industrie en particulier l’industrie de transformation ; et promouvoir la valeur et la compétitivité des produits agricoles locaux.

Développement durable

Il est conseillé aussi aux localités du delta du Mékong de respecter scrupuleusement le cours naturel du fleuve et de sélectionner des modèles appropriés durables et respectueux de l’environnement pour s’adapter ainsi que de concevoir des scénarios et des mesures pour faire face aux éventuelles catastrophes à venir. Il leur est également demandé de réduire les cultures de riz afin de minimiser la surexploitation des eaux souterraines.

Si elle est approuvée la planification servira de base pour allouer et mobiliser efficacement les ressources pour l’essor de la plus grande zone agricole du Vietnam. Elle aidera à réaliser le développement durable et l’adaptation au changement climatique conformément à la Résolution gouvernementale N°120 sur le développement durable de la région. Cela contribuera par là-même aux efforts du gouvernement pour se joindre à la réponse mondiale au changement climatique.



Une région vulnérable

Onze des 22 types de catastrophes naturelles dans le monde ont été répertoriés dans le delta du Mékong tels que les inondations les tempêtes les orages les basses pressions atmosphériques l’érosion des sols etc.

Pour la neuvième semaine consécutive des milliers de personnes ont défilé dans les rues de France pour protester contre la mise en place du pass sanitaire mais aussi contre l'obligation vaccinale pour les personnels soignants qui doit entrer en vigueur le 15 septembre. Dans les cortèges beaucoup de soignants donc qui seront contraints à partir de mercredi prochain d'être vaccinés sous peine d'être suspendus. Mais malgré la menace de la suspension certains refusent de plier et assurent préférer quitter l'hôpital.

L'un après l'autre des centaines de soignants ont jeté leur blouse blanche sur le trottoir juste devant le ministère de la Santé. Un geste fort avant d'être suspendu. Aide soignante Céline a peur de ne bientôt plus pouvoir payer ses factures. ""J'ai la chance d'avoir encore mon mari qui travaille. On a deux enfants et des charges à payer comme tout le monde et on ne sait pas comment on va faire"" a-t-elle confié à Europe 1 assurant avoir ""commencé à chercher du travail ailleurs"". ""La Santé ne veut pas de moi c'est pas grave je trouverai ailleurs"" a-t-elle poursuivi. Et d'insister sur son mal-être. ""Quand je rentre chez moi le soir je ne suis pas bien.""

300.000 soignants ne sont pas encore vaccinés

Dans le cortège Muriel infirmière va elle aussi quitter l'hôpital. Mais elle est inquiète du sort de ses patients. ""Certains s'arrêtent et laissent leurs patients sans soin ce qui est dramatique parce qu'il y a un énorme besoin de soins partout en France"" regrette-t-elle. ""Soit on est obligé de laisser nos patients complètement seuls sans aucun recours et sans savoir quand on pourra les resoigner à nouveau soit on choisit d'exercer quand même mais dans l'illégalité donc en risquant de prendre des sanctions sévères.""

ROME -- Fifteen days before he is scheduled to play in what will likely be his final French Open Rafael Nadal is so unsatisfied with his level of tennis that he is still debating whether to go to Roland Garros.

Nadal's surgically repaired hip and 37-year-old legs didn't provide him with the necessary means to be competitive enough Saturday as ninth-ranked Hubert Hurkacz overwhelmed the 22-time Grand Slam champion on the Spaniard's beloved clay for a 6-1 6-3 victory in the third round of the Italian Open.

It was Nadal's first match against a top-10 player in 1½ years and he couldn't have been more disappointed.

""Tough day for me in all ways because I felt more ready than what I showed"" Nadal said. ""I am little bit more unpredictable today not playing enough for the last two years. Too many doubts.""

In terms of games won it was the most lopsided loss for Nadal on clay in 21 years since also winning only four games against Gaston Gaudio in Hamburg in 2003 when he was 16.

Now Nadal will need to dig deeper on the practice court if wants to be competitive one last time at the French Open where he is the record 14-time champion. Roland Garros starts May 26.

Nadal said he had two options for Paris.

""One is to say 'OK I am not ready I am not playing enough well'"" Nadal said. ""Another is accept how I am today and work the proper way to try to be in a different way in two weeks.

""The decision as you can imagine is not clear in my mind today. But if I have to say what's my feeling and if my mind is closer one way or the other way I going to say be in Roland Garros and try my best. Physically I have some issues but not probably yet enough to say not playing in the most important event of my tennis career.""

Nadal is still regaining his fitness after missing nearly all of 2023 with a hip injury that required surgery

""Let's see what's going on how I feel myself mentally tomorrow after tomorrow and in one week"" Nadal said. ""If I feel ready I going to try to be there and fight for the things that I have been fighting the last 15 years if now seems impossible.""

Against the big-serving Hurkacz Nadal appeared slow at times and lacked the lucidness to finish off points. Twice in the first set Nadal missed drop shot attempts to hand Hurkacz breaks of his serve.

Then early in the second set Nadal lacked oomph on a backhand volley allowing Hurkacz to reply with a forehand up the line that clipped the net and landed in for another break.

On the changeovers Nadal sat hunched over sweat dripping from his headband and deep in thought for solutions that he couldn't find.

Nadal has indicated this will be his final season on tour and fans inside Campo Centrale tried to encourage the record 10-time Rome champion with chants of ""Ole Ole Ole Ra-fa Ra-fa.""

Nadal hadn't faced a top-10 player since beating No. 4 Casper Ruud at the 2022 ATP Finals.

He didn't convert any of his seven break points and committed twice as many unforced errors as Hurkacz 20-10. Hurkacz served nine aces to Nadal's one.

After the match Nadal declined to participate in a celebration of his career that local organizers had prepared.

Meanwhile top-ranked Novak Djokovic said he was ""fine"" after accidentally getting knocked on the head by a water bottle while signing autographs after his opening win Friday.

But Djokovic wasn't taking any further chances when he showed up at the Foro Italico for practice on Saturday putting on a biking helmet when he met with fans again.

In the women's tournament top-ranked Iga Swiatek beat Yulia Putintseva 6-3 6-4 for her eighth consecutive win.

Swiatek trailed 4-1 in the second set but then won five straight games after saving four break points to hold for 2-4.

""I needed to get my focus together"" Swiatek said. ""I know that I can play good tennis because I did it in the first set. So I just wanted to come back to being solid and really work for the points because she's really changing the rhythm so it's not easy to play against her.""

Having won the Madrid Open last week Swiatek is attempting to become the first woman to win the ""dirt double"" since Serena Williams in 2013. She is already a two-time Rome champion.

Nadal was Swiatek's role model.

""He's a huge inspiration"" Swiatek said. ""He's basically the only idol I ever had in my life. So it's great that he's back to play some tennis.""

Also Paula Badosa rallied past Diana Shnaider 5-7 6-4 6-4 to reach the fourth round at a WTA 1000 event for the first time since her quarterfinal appearance in Rome last year.

Hurkacz will next face 25th-seeded Tomas Etcheverry who eliminated Thiago Seyboth Wild 6-3 7-5.

Also advancing was 21st-seeded Nicolas Jarry who saved seven set points in the second set to overcome Italy's Matteo Arnaldi and a partisan crowd with a 6-2 7-6 (6) win.

The Dallas Education Foundation is the direct non-profit philanthropic partner of Dallas ISD with a mission of inspiring community investment to accelerate student success.

The campaign theme — the Heart of Teaching — is a tribute to the 10000+ teachers in Dallas ISD and an opportunity to recognize the talents of our Dallas ISD art educators a majority of whom are working artists.

Every day Dallas ISD art teachers share their gifts with our students and encourage lift and enable them to do more than they thought possible. An art exhibition of nearly 60 of Dallas ISD teacher-artists will be open for viewing at the Music Hall at Fair Park during the State Fair of Texas. Admission is complimentary with valid admission to the Fair.

“The Heart of Teaching is a collaboration between the Dallas Education Foundation Dallas ISD and the Dallas Summer Musicals” said Devon Miller Director of Education and Community Partnerships at Dallas Summer Musicals. “It will be the first-ever teacher visual arts showcase hosted at the Music Hall during the run of the State Fair.

“The culmination of the exhibition will be an evening of drinks and dessert reception on October 25 2021 in the Crystal Terrace at the Music Hall at Fair Park.”

All artwork will be available for purchase with bidding starting on the opening day of the State Fair and closing at the Oct 25 evening event. All proceeds support the Dallas Education Foundation as they work to fund equity-minded programming district-wide.

“Our educators have a heart for teaching and we are incredibly appreciative to have the opportunity to elevate our Dallas ISD art teachers with this exhibit” said Mita Havlick Executive Director of the Dallas Education Foundation. “The foundation’s positive impact is deep and the exhibition along with the evening reception is the perfect launch to the foundation’s annual campaign.”

Dallas ISD was recently named a 2021 District of Distinction by the Texas Art Education Association – one of only 40 out of 1110 districts across the State.

“Dallas ISD is the largest district to ever be awarded this honor.” says Monica Hayslip Dallas ISD Director of Visual Arts “We have an art program on every campus and nearly 300 art teachers in the district. Each one of them is credited with us being named a District of Distinction.”

Atmos Energy is serving as the Heart of Teaching’s title museum sponsor with the Addy Foundation the Dallas Mavericks Grand Canyon University and Texas Instruments as the additional major sponsors.

“We know that the Dallas Education Foundation does a fantastic job of advocating for our students and for Dallas ISD” said Jonathan Fredi Manager of Public Affairs at Atmos Energy. “You have to educate the whole child and you cannot leave out art. Through our Fueling Safe and Thriving Communities program we want to give our Dallas ISD students every opportunity to succeed.”

“The gallery exhibition and evening reception are only possible through a partnership with Dallas Summer Musicals and the support of Atmos Energy and all of our sponsors” Havlick said. “They know that together we power the future of Dallas – our students.”

Rick Holliday thinks it should be. The longtime Bay Area developer turned a former Naval submarine factory into one that has been doing exactly that. Workers at Factory OS construct apartment building components on Mare Island in Vallejo Calif. about 40 miles from San Francisco then transport them on flatbed trucks to their final location. “By the end of the process it goes out the door and it’s a fully formed apartment that you put together like Legos to form a completed building.”

The process can cut the time it takes to build an apartment building in half to roughly only 11 to 12 months he said with multiple parts of construction taking place at once in a controlled environment which means fewer delays and a more streamlined process in general.

Mr. Holliday who co-founded the factory with Larry Pace said doing it this way versus constructing a building on site also cuts costs by as much as 30 percent. In the Bay Area where the price of building a single affordable housing unit is close to $1 million it can mean the difference between a developer building an apartment or not.",,,,,,,,,

Or perhaps — depending on your perspective — it is the capybaras who are dealing with an invasion of humans.

Residents of Buenos Aires’ Nordelta community have seen an influx of the world’s largest rodent over the last several weeks according to the Guardian.

The capybaras or carpinchos as they are known locally like to eat up lawns and gardens and attack dogs according to the report. Their presence can lead to traffic accidents and they leave their marks in other ways too.

Some residents have reportedly dug out guns to deal with the unwanted visitors but wildlife officials have stopped people from touching the capybaras.

The influx is no surprise to some. Ecologist Enrique Viale said that it’s wrong to say the capybaras are “invading” Nordelta. “It’s the other way round: Nordelta invaded the ecosystem of the carpinchos” he said.

Nordelta was built in the wetlands of the Paraná River an area that Viale has campaigned to protect. Viale and others say the capybaras are just returning to their natural habitat the Guardian reported.

“Wealthy real estate developers with government backing have to destroy nature in order to sell clients the dream of living in the wild — because the people who buy those homes want nature but without the mosquitoes snakes or carpinchos” Viale told the paper.

Some Argentines have painted the conflict in Nordelta in a somewhat humorous socioeconomic light saying the capybaras are standing up to the country’s wealthy elite.

The growing signs of supply tightness in the United States as a result of Hurricane Ida more than offset the bearish influences of Saudi Arabia’s price cut to Asia and China’s releasing oil from its strategic petroleum reserve.

On Friday December WTI crude oil settled at $69.13 up $1.52 or +2.25% and December Brent crude oil finished at $72.26 up $1.47 or +2.03%.

The oil market also got a boost from news of a call between U.S. President Joe Biden and his Chinese Counterpart Xi Jinping. The call raised hopes for warmer relations and more global trade Reuters reported.

In other news the United States added rigs in the latest week energy service provider Baker Hughes said indicating production may rise in coming weeks.

Over Two-Thirds of Offshore Oil Output Remains Shut in US Gulf – Regulator

U.S. offshore oil companies restored almost 200000 barrels of production on Friday while most of the Gulf Coast crude output remained offline following Hurricane Ida government data showed.

The storm hit the U.S. Gulf of Mexico almost two weeks ago damaging infrastructure and removing more than 21 million barrels of production from the market Reuters reported.

Over two-thirds of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico’s oil production or 1.2 million barrels per day were still shut as repair efforts dragged on helping to support global oil prices.

US Gulf Coast Oil Refiners Recovering Faster than Producers

Most of the nine Louisiana refineries shut by Hurricane Ida have restarted or were restarting on Friday nearly two weeks after the powerful storm came ashore a Reuters survey showed.

Refiners are coming back faster than oil production a reverse of past storm recoveries. Just three of the nine refineries were completely idled accounting for about 7% of Gulf Coast refining compared to shut-ins of two-thirds of oil output.

US Gulf Coast Offshore Rigs Start to Return after Ida – Baker Hughes

U.S. energy firms this week added oil and natural gas rigs for a fifth time in six weeks as offshore oil units in the Gulf of Mexico slowly started to return after Hurricane Ida slammed into the coast.

This week 4 offshore oil rigs returned in Louisiana energy services firm Baker Hughes Co said in its closely followed report on Friday.

Last week all offshore rigs operating in the Gulf of Mexico shut due to Ida. All of them were seeking oil and located off Louisiana.

Short-Term Outlook

Friday’s jump in prices suggests that traders are concerned over the speed of the production recovery in the Gulf of Mexico. This concern is likely to continue into next week. Conditions could improve rapidly next week as long as the weather cooperates but we’re at the peak of hurricane season so anything can happen.

Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki met with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Saturday and both pledged to ensure that gas continues to flow across Ukraine an effort to allay Kyiv's fears that the Kremlin will use Nord Steam 2 as a geopolitical weapon.

Russia's state-owned Gazprom which owns the Nord Stream 2 AG company said it hopes to be able to ship 5.6 bcm of gas through the pipeline before the end of this year.

But first it needs to put the final touches on construction check the gas link for safety and obtain a license to operate from Germany's energy regulator.

Plans to Stick Around (Published 2021),"Bank of America made sweeping changes to the company’s leadership Friday that elevated several executives including three women to senior jobs and all but guaranteed that Brian Moynihan the chief executive would remain at the helm of the nation’s second-largest bank for years to come.

The company promoted Alastair Borthwick its current head of commercial banking in New York to chief financial officer. It also gave more responsibilities to Dean Athanasia who runs the consumer-banking division from Boston. Lauren Mogensen was elevated to general counsel.

Mr. Moynihan is 61 and the race to succeed him is likely to be a long one. Senior executives being groomed for top jobs typically need several years of experience helping to oversee all aspects of a company before they are deemed eligible to take the helm.

Mr. Moynihan signaled his intention to stick around: In a letter to staff he said the new cohort of leaders will help him run the bank in accordance with a growth strategy he put in place in 2010 — when he took the chief executive job — “through its second decade with me and with all of you.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hc2h1YXRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC1uZXdzLzIwMjEvMDkvMTEvYmFuay1vZi1hbWVyaWNhLWFubm91bmNlcy1uLWgteW91dGgtc2VsZWN0ZWQtYXMtc3R1ZGVudC1sZWFkZXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bank of America announces N.H. youth selected as student leaders,"PORTSMOUTH – Bank of America announced that the two New Hampshire students selected as Student Leaders (#BofAStudentLeaders) have started their paid summer internship experience of workforce skills leadership and civic engagement with local nonprofits Harbor Care and the New Hampshire Food Bank. This year students have the option to voluntarily participate in in-person activities as part of the internship.

Without access to career skills-building opportunities like the Student Leaders program many young people may be left behind from a fast-changing job market leading to higher rates of youth unemployment.

“Bank of America remains committed to supporting young adults by connecting them to jobs community engagement and leadership development opportunities” said Ken Sheldon President Bank of America New Hampshire. “We recognize young adults are the future of our community which is why programs like Student Leaders are one way we can provide paid opportunities for students to gain job experience while developing a diverse pipeline of talent as they enter the local workforce.”

The class of 2021 New Hampshire Bank of America Student Leaders are:

• Enya Gu rising senior at Nashua High School South interning at Harbor Car.

• Eliana Mlawski rising senior at The Governor’s Academy interning with the New Hampshire Food Bank.

The Student Leaders program which started in 2004 recognizes 300 community-focused juniors and seniors from across the U.S. annually. The New Hampshire-based Student Leaders will engage in an eight-week paid internship and participate in programming that includes a collaborative mentor-focused project working closely with Harbor Care and the New Hampshire Food Bank.

Harbor Care is an innovative nonprofit serving adults children and families throughout New Hampshire. The organization provides supportive housing  medical dental and behavioral health care substance use treatment veteran services and employment supports — to more than 5000 New Hampshire community members.

Gu is interning with Harbor Care’s communications department where she is researching and drafting Harbor Care website articles on topics such as the impact of housing on an individual’s health and mental wellbeing and the impact of trauma on addiction. Gu is also working with the organization’s grant writers and supporting the organization’s social media outreach.

The New Hampshire Food Bank serves as the state’s only food bank working to provide nutritious meals and other resources to the hundreds of thousands of New Hampshire residents that are food insecure. The Food Bank supplies millions of pounds of food annually to more than 400 partner agencies including food pantries homeless shelters soup kitchens children’s programs and senior centers.

At the New Hampshire Food Bank Mlawski’s main focus is two initiatives: the “NH Feeding NH” program and the Food Bank’s participation in the NH Food Alliance’s “NH Eats Local Month.” Mlawski is creating an outreach plan for contacting farmers and partner agencies to collect stories and anecdotes detailing their experiences and is helping to design a social campaign surrounding these stories of impact. Mlawski has also supported the planning of the NH Food Bank’s participation in NH Eats Local Month.

In addition to their work with the Harbor Care and the New Hampshire Food Bank Gu and Mlawski will participate virtually in sessions on the vital role nonprofits play in advancing community health and the importance of public-private partnerships to drive social change while building financial acumen. The Student Leaders also take part in a virtual Summit in partnership with the Close Up Foundation to participate in Stanford University’s Young Democracy at Home program which encourages conversation about current issues facing young people today.

Prop Du Toit scooped the ball up before forcing his way over with Finn Russell adding the conversion.

Nine minutes later Bath scored again but this time it needed checking. Du Toit fell short of the line but the ball found Spencer. The officials looked to see if there was a knock-on in the build-up but the try stood and was converted from close range.

Bath looked to be running away with it when Cokanasiga powered over in the right corner on 28 minutes before another Russell conversion.

The Falcons got on the board when Blamire forced himself over the line following a superb maul near the corner but Brett Connon's conversion fell just short.

Gallagher scythed through the Newcastle defence on 38 minutes and secured a bonus point with another converted try.

Blamire responded to end the half with his second following another driving maul. Again Connon failed to convert.

The frenetic pace to the match did not cease after the break; Newcastle were not letting go of the slim chance of a first victory in over a year and their scrum which had been dominant all night maintained their foothold in the game.

Stuart's try came after another strong drive as Newcastle made their superior territory and possession count.

Sale Sharks heaped pressure on Bristol Bears Saracens and Harlequins with a deserved bonus-point 31-22 victory over Leicester Tigers as Alex Sanderson’s side continued their attacking rebirth to move into the Gallagher Premiership play-off places.

In almost certainly Sale’s last home game of the season club stalwart Sam James had the fairytale ending before departing in the summer as he scored an immensely popular try and also set up Tom O’Flaherty’s bonus-point score with a sumptuous kick.

Early tries from Gus Warr and Tommy Taylor helped condemn Leicester to a pointless defeat as they chase Investec Champions Cup qualification for next season.

Dan Cole Matt Scott and George Martin crossed for Dan McKellar’s side but they were distinctly second-best as familiar face Manu Tuilagi also ran riot on his final home game for Sale too.

A good night was made even better for Sale fans when director of rugby Sanderson announced in a TNT Sports interview after the game that he had signed a three-year contract extension.

Tigers will be relying on Hollywoodbets Sharks beating Gloucester in the EPCR Challenge Cup final to secure the final English Champions Cup spot for next season.

Bath also continued their charge for the play-offs against Newcastle Falcons securing the bonus point in a rampant first half before holding off a late home comeback to move up to second place in the table with a 28-17 victory.

Leicester got off to the stronger start when veteran prop Dan Cole charged over the try line inside five minutes but the lead lasted only five minutes before a huge carry from Tuilagi put the Tigers defence on the back foot before Warr weaved his way over the line from close range.

To make matters worse Ollie Hassell-Collins was sent to the sin bin for a high shot when bringing down the barnstorming Tuilagi and Sale cashed in on their numerical advantage when Tommy Taylor finished off another neat lineout move a second successful conversion putting Sale 14-5 up.

An action-packed opening quarter continued to deliver the goods when Scott’s interception try narrowed the gap to two points.

The most celebrated score of the night arrived just before the break when James in his final home game for his boyhood club finished a fine team move to extend the hosts’ lead once more.

And the full-back was again instrumental for the crucial bonus-point score early in the second half sending a clever grubber kick through for O’Flaherty to gather and dive over in the corner.

Leicester’s resistance waned from then on Ford adding a penalty to further extend the lead and a consolation score from Martin in the closing minutes did little to spring any serious hopes of a comeback.

Bath go joint-top with Newcastle win

Bath continued their charge for the play-offs against Newcastle securing the bonus point in a rampant first half before holding off a late home comeback to move up to second place in the table with a 28-17 victory.

With creative hub Finn Russell back in the side following an injury  the visitors got off to a strong start Thomas du Toit reacting quickest to a loose ball to dot down the opening try after five minutes.

Scores from Ben Spencer and Joe Cokanasiga before the half-hour mark had Bath in cruise control but a frantic first half still had plenty to offer as Jamie Blamire crossed twice for Newcastle either side of Matt Gallagher’s bonus point-securing try for Bath to send the sides in at 28-10 at the break.

The second half was far less eventful with just one score to show for it Sam Stuart narrowing the gap with a third Falcons try but it was not enough to spark an unlikely fightback.

The away side secured the try bonus-point in a rampant first half – Thomas du Toit Ben Spencer Joe Cokanasiga and Matt Gallagher all scoring tries – with only Jamie Blamire’s double providing respite for their opponents.

The returning Finn Russell was imperious from the tee nailing all four conversions to give his side a commanding 28-10 lead at half-time.

Sam Stuart’s try after the interval was reward for a spirited display from the home side who stopped Bath from notching any points to add to their first-half haul – but there was no comeback for the crowd to savour with Bath moving second.

Russell was restored to the starting line-up for the visitors his first start since picking up a groin injury in the Champions Cup defeat by Exeter last month.

It took less than five minutes for his side to open the scoring Du Toit scooping up a loose ball and dotting down for his 11th try of the season.

The onslaught continued with the Falcons unable to stop the yellow tide early on.

Spencer was next to score taking the ball from a ruck in the 13th minute and weaving his way through the posts also surviving a TMO review.

The hosts should have cut the deficit seven minutes later when Cameron Hutchison broke through the line to force a two-on-two situation but his offload to Guy Pepper was sloppy and the chance was gone.

And they were punished in the 28th minute when Cokanasiga went over on the right wing – Russell nailed the tricky conversion to extend the lead to 21-0.

Sale Sharks celebrate Alex Sanderson’s new deal with crucial Premiership win over Leicester Tigers

Blamire finally provided some cheer for the North East faithful nine minutes before the break scoring from a maul in the right corner but the usually reliable Brett Connon sent his kick wide.

Bath’s bonus point was secured when Gallagher finished off a superb team move before Blamire doubled his tally from another maul with the last play of the half to give the Falcons some hope going into the interval.

After a lengthy period of pressure the hosts finally grabbed their third try through Stuart. Connon added the extras for the first time on the night to reduce the arrears to 11 points.

The reverse fixture was one of the Falcons’ closer games this season only losing by eight points on the opening weekend of the Premiership and they were proving a nuisance in the second period here limiting Bath’s attacking chances and crafting openings of their own.

But as has been the case all season a lack of ruthlessness and their habit of having to chase the game cost them in the end.

Symoné added that adding a new subplot might be a problem in other acting jobs. “If you ever see me in another character you see Raven Baxter and that’s just what the deal is” Symoné added. “And I think the one thing that differentiates me from her is now a lot more.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdHByZXNzLmNvbS9tdXNpYy9jYXJyaWUtYmF4dGVyLXRvLWJyaW5nLWhlci1zb3VsZnVsLXNvdW5kLXRvLXRoZS15ZS1zZXJpZXMtdG9uaWdodC0yMjg3MDUxMNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Carrie Baxter to bring her soulful sound to the Y&E Series tonight,"Watch the acclaimed Waterford artist performing live on the Y&E Series tonight – supported by the Department of Tourism Culture Arts Gaeltacht Sport and Media...

The four plays: “Heads or Tail(s)?” “Thank you for your Service” “Blood on the Road” and “Ganga Nyoko! Inzima Nyoko!” emerged as the winners at the 11th annual Baxter Zabalaza Theatre Festival in March. The shows tackle a wide variety of themes including identity self-expression memory childhood trauma forgotten war veterans and gender. Mdu Kweyama artistic director of the Zabalaza Theatre Festival said: “The impact of lockdown and the Covid-19 pandemic meant that we had to think innovatively and differently about conceptualising and planning the main festival as well as the mini festivals.

“It was quite clear from the mini festivals that the new approach to the script development process and where industry practitioners worked closely with the writers at an early stage helped us to reach one of our long-term goals. “In the past only one production was selected and it was known as ’The Best of Zabalaza’. “However due to the exceptionally high standard of work on the festival held earlier this year we are delighted to have created this brand new ’Zabalaza Season of the Best Masembeni!’”

Stephren Saayman Melanie Scholtz Ntando Peter in “Heads or Tail(s)?” Picture: Star Zwane “Heads or Tail(s)?” delves into the life of a family torn by a secret harboured by the mother. Her three children are battling to find the truth. Twin sisters are desperate to know how their father died while their adopted brother wishes to be initiated. For this to happen he needs to reconnect with his biological family and ancestors.

Everyone has questions that will connect them to their identity and culture but it hinges on which side of the coin the truth lands. Buhle Qinga Aphiwe Livi in “Thank you for your Service”. Picture: Star Zwane In “Thank you for your Service” a young man who followed in the footsteps of his father has completed his service in the army and returns home to visit his family. The play deals with the trauma that soldiers and their families go through while in service and how little the government offers them in return for their loyalty and patriotic deeds.

Cast from “Blood on the Road”. Picture: Star Zwane “Blood on the Road” examines how for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. What happens when one suffers from the consequences of another’s reaction when anger builds up because of the past and how easy it is to fake love when based on hidden agendas. Sibuyiselo Dywili Siyamthanda Bangani in Ganga Nyoko! Inzima Nyoko!. Picture: Star Zwane. A young gay doctor returns to his village after his father dies. He tries to hide his sexuality from his childhood friend during their reunion.

“Ganga Nyoko! Inzima Nyoko!” shows what lengths he must go through to conceal his identity for his own safely. This moving tale exposes the pain and difficulties experienced by a community who just want to be their true selves and to be accepted. Kweyama says hosting a festival during the pandemic has by far been the biggest challenge for him and his team. “The Covid pandemic has certainly created many challenges for us but we are living in strange and difficult times and we must comply with restrictions at the time.",,,,,,

Patients in Nottinghamshire have been advised by the NHS routine blood tests are currently suspended due to a global shortage of blood tubes.

A notice sent by the health service to patients in Nottingham city confirmed the shortage with only urgent blood tests to be conducted ‘for the foreseeable future’.

It comes as the NHS confirmed the global shortage of blood tubes caused by ongoing issues experienced by Plymouth-based supplier Becton Dickinson.

The supplier the NHS says has confirmed additional blood tube supplies will be provided but this must first be delivered and tested.

There is a shortage of bottles for blood tests.

GP surgeries hospital trusts and other NHS providers have been contacting patients in regard to the shortage with Derby Road Health Centre in Nottingham issuing a notice to patients on Wednesday September 9.

The notice said: “Due to the national blood bottle shortage the NHS is only able to provide urgent bloods for the foreseeable future.

“All routine blood tests are currently suspended.”

Commenting on the issue the NHS says ‘constrained supply’ led to action being taken to ‘prioritise the most urgent tests’.

Text messages messages on social media or website notices are being issued to notify patients of the changes.

The Nottingham and Nottinghamshire Clinical Commissioning Group said: “While Becton Dickinson has confirmed it will provide additional blood tube supplies the stock must first be delivered and then go through the appropriate safety checks before the NHS is able to put them to use in patient care.

“Therefore as we continue to face a constrained supply it is vital GPs hospitals and trusts continue to follow the guidance until further advised to reduce the number of tests carried out and prioritise patients with the most urgent need.”

NHS England has previously confirmed the shortage could last until mid-September with overall supply “likely to remain challenging for a significant period”.

Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway recorded a hefty $2.4 billion of underwriting losses from the terrorist attacks on September 11 2001. However a nuclear assault could have put the investor's company out of business entirely along with its insurance peers.

""Had a nuclear device been available to Osama bin Laden the loss could have bankrupted most of the industry Berkshire very much included"" Buffett wrote in a Washington Post editorial in November 2001. He added that the total insured losses could have surpassed $1 trillion exceeding the combined value of the world's property-casualty insurers at the time.

Berkshire counts Geico National Indemnity and General Reinsurance among its subsidiaries making it one of the largest insurers in the world. Its underwriting losses from 9/11 dealt a $1.5 billion blow to its net earnings fueling a sharp decline from $3.3 billion in 2000 to less than $800 million in 2001. Berkshire stomached an estimated 3% to 5% of the global insurance industry's losses from the incident.

Buffett kicked himself in his letter to Berkshire shareholders in 2001. He knew a major terrorist attack could occur and was aware of the devastating impact it might have on Berkshire. Yet he failed to adjust the insurance policies his company was writing which would have softened the blow to its bottom line.

""I violated the Noah rule: Predicting rain doesn't count; building arks does"" he said. The investor added that Berkshire was perfectly willing to pay out upwards of $2 billion following a catastrophe but in the case of 9/11 it hadn't charged enough for assuming the risk that led to a loss of that scale.

Berkshire wasn't cowed by the episode however. In the months after 9/11 it was one of the few insurers to actively cover terrorism losses. For example it wrote policies for multiple international airlines Chicago's Sears Tower and a North Sea oil platform Buffett disclosed in his letter.

""Whatever the world's problems our checks will clear"" he proclaimed. Buffett is known for prizing financial security and ensuring Berkshire has ample cash to weather difficult periods.

While Berkshire sold a significant amount of terrorism insurance after 9/11 it limited its coverage of nuclear chemical and biological attacks Buffett noted during his company's annual shareholder meeting in 2002.

A major nuclear explosion would pose an existential threat to Berkshire he explained while a biological attack in a major factory or office building would result in workers' compensation losses that could ""make the World Trade Center loss look like nothing.""

Buffett emphasized that the human cost of a terrorist attack far exceeds the insurance costs but asserted that Berkshire has to consider whether it can cover claims. If the company collapsed into bankruptcy it wouldn't be able to compensate those involved in the disaster not to mention others who suffered injuries years ago but rely on insurance payouts to live he said.

Charlie Munger Buffett's business partner and Berkshire's vice-chairman underscored the tragedy of 9/11 but framed it as an important lesson for the company.

""To the extent that September 11th has caused us to be less weak foolish and sloppy as we plainly were in facing some plain reality it's a plus"" he said at the meeting in 2002.

Berkshire's fallout from 9/11 pales in comparison to the deaths injuries and national trauma caused by the attack. But it showed that even careful insurers can be caught off-guard by catastrophes and taught Buffett and Munger some important lessons.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA5LzExL2J1ZmZldHRzLXN0b2NrLXBpY2tpbmctbGlldXRlbmFudC1oYXMtYS1wcm92ZW4tdHJhY2stcmVjb3JkLWJ1dC1oaXMtaGFuZHMtYXJlLXRpZWQtYXQtYmVya3NoaXJlLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Buffett's stock-picking lieutenant has a proven track record but his hands are tied at Berkshire,"Ted Weschler one of Warren Buffett's two investment lieutenants grew his retirement account from $70000 to more than $260 million in less than 30 years. The astronomical returns were achieved by investing in stocks of under-the-radar small-cap firms and other underappreciated opportunities. However when it comes to managing money for Berkshire Hathaway  Weschler is limited as to what he can achieve even with his stellar stock-picking skills. It was recently reported that Weschler now 59 managed to pull off a whopping 300000% gain in his personal retirement account from 1983 when he started his first job to the end of 2018 according to IRS information that ProPublica obtained. Speaking to Washington Post's Allan Sloan Weschler revealed that there isn't a direct overlap between his personal investments and opportunities he looks for at his day job for Berkshire. He told Sloan that his picks for the conglomerate tend to have a minimum value of $500 million without giving Berkshire a stake of 10% or more. Weschler who joined Berkshire Hathaway in 2012 managed $13 billion in the conglomerate's $300 billion equity portfolio as of early 2019. A $500 million stake would represent less than 5% of a $13 billion portfolio. In other words a bet below $500 million would be too small to have a meaningful impact on the overall portfolio. This minimum requirement effectively excludes Weschler from the entire small-cap universe where he found his some of the winning bets for his personal investments. ""The best bargains over the past year and today are in smaller and mid-cap companies that used to be large and got crushed. He has too much capital to do that"" said Bill Smead chief investment officer at Smead Capital Management and a Berkshire shareholder. ""[Buffett] effectively tied Weschler's hands behind his back. He couldn't do for Berkshire Hathaway what had made him successful as one of the all-time great investors"" Smead said. Weschler declined to comment. In October 2020 Weschler disclosed a near 6% personal stake in department store Dillard's  which has a $4 billion market cap. The stock has surged more than 200% this year on the back of the economic reopening. Weschler also personally bought Optical Cable Corporation in recent years according to regulatory filings. The company with just a $27 million market cap gained 35% this year so far. At Berkshire the smallest company it invests in is EW Scripps  which has a market cap of $1.3 billion. In the first quarter of 2021 the conglomerate took a 30% stake in the media company which required regulatory approval. ""His bets need to be large enough to have an outsized impact on the performance of the portfolio but also small enough for the portfolio to withstand a catastrophic loss"" said James Shanahan Berkshire analyst at Edward Jones. Although Weschler might not be able to go bargain-hunting freely for Berkshire he did help pick stocks that drove growth in Berkshire's portfolio. It's widely speculated that Weschler or Buffett's other investment lieutenant Todd Combs orchestrated many bets that break with Berkshire tradition in recent years. The conglomerate added a slew of IPO and pre-IPO investments  including Brazilian fintechs StoneCo and Nubank Snowflake and India's largest digital payments start-up Paytm. These stakes are all around Weschler's sweet spot of half a billion. Berkshire's investments in Apple and Amazon were also likely due to Weschler and Combs' influence holdings which played a key role in generating alpha and reaped billions of dollars in return.

For now.

There exists on Facebook a black market for expensive and rare whiskeys. It’s been around a while but I learned about it a few months back when I started hunting Pappy Van Winkle one of the rarest bottles of bourbon out there and someone told me about a group where bottles were bought and sold like hotcakes. I didn’t join the group until later but now I wish I had right away. It would have helped find Pappy Van Winkle. It is a very interesting place. It might not be around much longer.

Now that you know which bottle to buy find out how to best enjoy it. Sign up here for a free 7-lesson guide on everything you need to know about bourbon.

The group I joined has more than 10000 members. It is one of the largest of the current crop of secret Facebook black market bourbon groups or as people online call them “secondary markets” of which there are quite a few. These are splinters of the previous largest group BSM or Bourbon Secondary Market which was shut down by Facebook in June of 2019 just before 46 state attorneys general signed letters urging Facebook eBay and Craigslist to crack down on illegal alcohol sales.

BSM had run for a handful of years and had upwards of 55000 members when it was removed. It wasn’t the first secondary whiskey market. Before that there was BX which succeeded Bourbon Exchange the first major Facebook whiskey buy/sell/trade group which was created in 2013 and shut down in 2016. Before that most whiskey buying trading and selling was done on Craigslist or eBay before those markets were shut down too. Before that collectors posted classified ads in newspapers.

Plenty of scotch and Japanese whisky is bought and sold too.

The factors behind today’s Facebook black market are basically the same as those that drove classifieds but amplified. Massive FB groups were co-created by the rabid fans of the Bourbon Boom of the 2000s and early 2010s who wanted more interesting or rare whiskeys than they could find at their local liquor stores; and by brands who build their prestige and profits by keeping production insanely low on their more intriguing releases; and by state and federal governments who want to control the sale of such dangerous things as bottles of bourbon.

In this market brands can serve as both enablers and narcs. In 2019 Buffalo Trace whose Antique Collection Pappy Van Winkle line and Weller series have extremely high demand and extremely low supply and which therefore represent a sizeable percentage of the bottles bought and sold on these black market groups released a statement alongside the release of its Pappy Van Winkle bottles. To paraphrase it: They asked retailers not to mark its price up (they still did) and threatened to sue the enthusiasts who bought and sold it illegally online (they still did it).

Yes selling alcohol online is illegal. But I can’t find one example of someone being arrested for a crime in connection with the shutting down of a black market group.

The group I joined is private but its moderators let me join even though my Facebook page identifies me as a freelance writer and a former editor at Gear Patrol. This lack of stringency isn’t surprising. Yes selling alcohol online is illegal. But I can’t find one example of someone being arrested for a crime in connection with the shutting down of a black market group. Facebook simply deletes the group and its members scurry to newer more fragmented still-operating groups. People do get arrested for illegal alcohol sales — for instance a man who was caught by a STING operation in 2017 in my home state of Pennsylvania while trying to sell bottles on Craigslist. On Facebook though the general feeling among people I talked to was that participating in these groups was illicit enough to feel a little fun but not to warrant time in the Big House. What were the feds gonna do — throw 10000 blue-collar dads in jail?

Still secrecy reigns. “The first rule of fight club is don’t talk about fight club” said Fred Minnick whiskey writer community member and editor-in-chief of Bourbon+ magazine. “There’s still a lot of mystery in this world. A lot of it should probably stay that way.”

But many people who are in these groups talked to me albeit anonymously. Almost everyone I spoke to imagined that like the large groups before them the current Facebook groups would probably soon be shut down. Against a pressure campaign from states the federal government and Facebook the remaining slices of the black market seem to be sitting ducks. Shortly after I joined the group an excellent writer named Aaron Goldfarb published a piece in Esquire titled “You Can Thank Facebook for Bourbon. You Can Thank It For Ruining Bourbon Too.” In it Goldfarb lays out the history of secret online groups and their important role in the Bourbon Boom of the 2000s and 2010s. The jig feels up.

Makeshift code obfuscates transactions between buyers and sellers.

There was an extensive set of rules regarding how business could be done in the group I joined including the first and most apocryphal: NO ALCOHOL SALES! Users practiced some paper-thin jiggery-pokery to work around this golden rule; sometimes for posts advertising the most exciting and expensive whiskeys people ignored this rule and post about selling them directly. The group was extremely active — I counted upwards of 15 posts every day. People sold whiskeys or they traded them or they posted bottles they were looking to buy or trade for. These deals were done in a mixture of code and clever wordplay that was easy to parse after a few tries.

Members told me stories of someone trading a Corvette for 23 bottles of Pappy’s 23 Year Old and of a group raising over $100000 for the family of a beloved member who passed away from cancer. Because the group is private and because I don’t want to dime them out and for my own safety — Goldfarb has received death threats for writing basic facts about certain groups’ methods — I won’t say too many specifics about the comings and goings there. It’s a shame because the group had all the fascinating community drama of any blackmarketplace. People haggled over $5 or $10 in an $800 purchase and wouldn’t budge an inch either way. Entire cases of bottles like Weller 12 posted at a reasonable price (say $110 each) were snapped up in two minutes flat. I saw bottles listed for as cheap as $45 and as much as $12000. Long debates and minor squabbles broke out over whose auction bid technically won a bottle requiring CSI-like inspection of timestamps and a close reading of the group’s bylaws. Overpriced bottles elicited shaming in the form of crying laughing emojis or worse no comments at all — e-crickets. There was almost none of the snark and sneering that goes on in the public bourbon groups where selling is not allowed. The tone was professionally straightforward — most comments focused on haggling clarifying or bidding. A bit like drunk antiques roadshow. Buying multiple bottles of Yamazaki 18 at $550 a piece. But keeping an eye on things for a couple weeks brought surprises. One post about acquiring a specific special edition bottle to honor a premature baby’s birthday — eventually that tiny little girl will be 21 — turned into a minor charity cause then a support group for the father with parents of premature kids and far worse tragedies chiming in to say simply that it gets better. “I’ve seen some wild drama both good and bad” said Goldfarb. Members told me stories of someone trading a Corvette for 23 bottles of Pappy’s 23 Year Old and of a group raising over $100000 for the family of a beloved member who passed away from cancer. The commonest argument against the groups though is more broad and comes from within the world of whiskey fandom: that the Facebook groups have “ruined” whiskey by inspiring hordes of collectors to chase after the same rare bottles and therefore have driven up price and sucked up all the good juice.

Then there is the bad stuff. At the top of most collectors’ minds are the cases of counterfeit or refilled bottles that were sold in the past causing major controversy within the groups. “Every so often a fraud gets found — counterfeiting bottles setting up a fake charity lying about his premature daughter to get free bottles” Goldfarb told me. The government’s case against such groups is that they could allow the sale of liquor that’s been tampered with or that expensive bottles of rare whiskeys could be bought by minors.

(Notable: the self-policing that happens with these groups. After counterfeit and refilled bottles started showing up in recent years a small crew started tracking all empty bottle sales on Craigslist and eBay cross-checking those bottle numbers against “new” bottles being sold on the group and subsequently outed at least one counterfeiter. Bans happen all the time for people who comment inappropriately or refuse to follow posting rules. Groups that do not allow sales and only focus on the value of bottles for reference have sprung up. “I noticed the prices were vastly different among groups” wrote Pete Koma the founder of one group BSM — Value Reference Only. “The group is strictly meant to stand the test of time. When all the buy/sell/trade groups are shut down the data will remain.”)

Users often post bottles without providing references or names of the bottle they’re selling meaning buyers must be able to identify specific expressions at a glance.

The commonest argument against the groups though is more broad and comes from within the world of whiskey fandom: that the Facebook groups have “ruined” whiskey by inspiring hordes of collectors to chase after the same rare bottles and therefore have driven up price and sucked up all the good juice.

That is a double-edged sword. Yes the Bourbon Boom has increased the price of bottles drastically. Prices of George T. Stagg for instance used to sell for around $150 in the first Bourbon Exchange Facebook group. In my group they went for $400. But the same people collecting at more expensive rates are the heart and soul of the culture and passion that makes up whiskey-drinking and collecting culture today. Without them and their thirst for the good stuff there would be far fewer whiskey bars whiskey publications and blogs or new rare and interesting releases (some of which are overpriced hype machinations some of which are fantastic) today. Some people claim they miss the “good old days” when the culture was smaller. There’s no going back now.

“I can’t tell you how many times I’ve gotten emails about hipsters in flannel shirts stealing up Pappy” Blake Riber who created and runs the whiskey blog Bourbonr told me. “I know the demographics. It’s not that.”

Where will things go from here? If Facebook continues to close the largest groups the slow fragmentation and disintegration of the marketplace will continue. The power of the Facebook groups is drawn from the fact that everyone and their mother is on Facebook these days all day. If Facebook shuts down whiskey-trading groups entirely it’s reasonable the base that makes its way over to dedicated non-social-media websites will slim to a fraction of its former self. But illicit whiskey trading like life finds a way. Maybe it’s into even smaller micro-communities living in group text messages slack or hipchat. Maybe this won’t change the culture much. Or maybe it will have a chilling effect on the bacchanal of bourbon and rare whiskey we live in today. Maybe it will be the beginning pop of the Bourbon Boom bubble.

New buyers and sellers are asked in the comments section to provide references from other users to ensure they’re good for shipping or paying on time.

Or maybe just maybe the community could glom onto new legislation to go legit. In 2017 Kentucky passed a Vintage Spirits Law which allows private collectors to circumvent the “three-tier system” (whiskey sold from distillers to distributors to retailers) and sell “vintage” spirits directly to a retailer bar or another private collector. This seems to open up a legal secondary market for unopened “vintage” spirits which simply must be something that is no longer for sale on the three-tier market. (This type of qausi-market already exists for selling beer.) At least one dedicated off-Facebook marketplace based in Kentucky seems to be in the works. It’s unclear what it will look like and what kind of whiskey culture it will create.

Fred Minnick already talks about the Facebook secondary markets in past tense. They’re not the same as they once were he says. When he looks back on them he says “they showed a passion a side of people in American whiskey that the distillers could never ever understand. Whiskey is much bigger than the brands than Facebook. It’s big. It’s not about the bottles. It’s about the culture the people gathering. These groups — they were our community where we huddled.”

In the meantime the fascinating cultural heart of rare whiskey will continue to beat on in their thinly veiled illicit Facebook pages where people like me can learn about little-known bottles like Cream of Kentucky I.W. Harper 15 Year or “dusty” vintage bottles of A.H. Hirsch and can build their own collections make online friends who share their passion or just watch with fascination as it all goes down.

I wish I could keep lurking until the very end. After I reached out over Facebook chat to the admins of the secret group I’d joined I received a polite response. “Hi Chris not exactly sure what you mean” they wrote. “It’s against FB policy to sell alcohol and we don’t allow that on our page.” Then I was banned.

How to get set up with streaming,"Netflix has so many great TV shows and movies that seemingly every time you hear about a new thing to watch it's on Netflix. For that reason you might be wondering how to watch the streaming service on your TV. Relax it's easy. Here's what you need to know.

First the basics: You'll need the Netflix app and you'll find it either installed on your smart TV or on a device connected to your TV. The most common of these are specialized streaming devices -- like a Roku Amazon Fire TV or Apple TV -- or game consoles like a PlayStation or Xbox. Once you have the app and the device you'll then need a Netflix subscription and a stable internet connection.

Ready to get hooked up? Here's everything you need to know.

Getting started with Netflix on a TV

Netflix plans start at $9 a month a price that enables you to watch a single screen at a time (TV phone or whatever) with the downside being it offers relatively low video quality (standard definition or SD). For people who want to watch on a big screen it's worth moving up to Netflix's most popular plan ($14 a month) which enables you to stream in high definition or HD to two screens at once. If you have a 4K TV or want to watch on up to four screens at once you'll want the $18 subscription.

Next you'll also need some way to connect the internet directly to the device that will stream Netflix (more on that below). Depending on the device you may need a wired Ethernet connection or more commonly Wi-Fi. To connect that device to Wi-Fi you'll need to make sure you know your Wi-Fi name and password. Netflix recommends a minimum connection speed of 1.5Mbps and most broadband services can reliably achieve this but if you're unsure try visiting SpeedTest to measure your speed.

Netflix's recommended speeds Standard definition (SD) 3Mbps High definition (HD) 5Mbps 4K/Ultra HD (UHD) 25Mbps

Devices you can use to watch Netflix

Once you have an account and internet connectivity you'll need a device to watch Netflix on. Just like on your phone there's a Netflix app for TVs and other devices including media streamers and video game consoles. The app is free but of course you'll need to install it on the device first. Bear in mind that all of the options below presume either Netflix is on board your TV or you have a modern TV with an HDMI port.

If you have an older analog TV without HDMI sadly these options won't work for you. Roku used to make a streamer with analog out called the Roku Express Plus but has been replaced with a model with HDMI only. If you really don't want to buy a new TV just to get Netflix you may be able to find one of the former versions -- just look for the tell-tale AV-out port.

Smart TV: If you have a flat-screen TV manufactured in the last 10 years you can probably already watch Netflix on it. Modern TVs integrate streaming services like Netflix into an interface known as ""smart TV."" While some TVs have a dedicated Netflix button on the remote most compatible models have a smart TV button that should let you access the streaming apps available. The app may be older slower and not as slick as the modern version but if you want to access Netflix right now it should still work.

Streaming device or game console: While some TVs have Netflix apps built-in many people watch Netflix on TV using a separate device connected to their TVs. If you're not using the TV's built-in smart platform you'll want to be sure the TV has an HDMI port. Almost every device of the Netflix devices we'll mention below use HDMI connections.

Likewise your Blu-ray player or gaming console might have a Netflix app. If you have a relatively recent console -- from the Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3 and up -- you'll be able to access Netflix on it. For example the PlayStation 3 is still able to offer the most up-to-date version of the app which includes browser sign-in.

Mobile device: Phones and tablets can also control Netflix on a TV although the process can be a bit more complex than either of the two methods above. If you want to use your phone to control Netflix you can use a feature called Chromecast built-in or for Apple users AirPlay to stream video from your device. Recent TVs from Sony and Vizio enable users to navigate the Netflix app on their phone and then press the Cast button (below) to stream to the TV. Apple users can use the AirPlay icon (a TV with an arrow beneath it) in a similar way for Roku devices Apple TV and other recent televisions. You can then control the action with the phone or the TV remote. If your TV doesn't have Chromecast onboard for example you can add a Google Chromecast which plugs into a spare HDMI port.

How to sign in to Netflix

Once you've got your device set up you'll open the Netflix app and be presented with a login screen. Recently Netflix added the option to sign on with a separate device even on older streamers like the PS3. No more typing long usernames and passwords with a remote just click on Sign on from Web at the bottom right of the screen. The device will give you a choice of a QR symbol or a code to type into an already-connected device (like your phone) here. However if your TV or streamer doesn't have this capability and you need to enter your Netflix login (username and password) manually first confirm the login details on a computer or phone first before trying it on your TV.

Need a streaming device? Start here

While your current smart TV game console or Blu-ray player with Netflix is the cheapest option it may not be the best one for you. If you have an older device for instance you may find its Netflix app to be sluggish or unreliable. You also miss out on interface improvements or new features such as the ability to watch interactive shows such as the Black Mirror special Bandersnatch or You vs. Wild (though it's not guaranteed). Or maybe you'd rather use a real remote instead of your console's controller.

The best way to access an up-to-date Netflix is via a new streaming device. Prices start at $30 with the Roku Express. Just plug one of these devices into a spare HDMI port on your current TV and follow the onscreen prompts. Many streamers include Netflix by default but each device (except Chromecast) also has a Streaming Channels list or App Store for downloading the app for free.

Amazon Fire TV Stick Lite Best budget streamer If you don't have a 4K TV and just want the cheapest option our pick is the basic Fire TV Stick. In addition to streaming Netflix and a bunch of other apps it has a remote with built-in voice search thanks to Alexa. Read our Amazon Fire TV Stick Lite review.

Sarah Tew/CNET Apple TV 4K (2021) Best for gamers and Apple fans The Apple TV 4K is the Rolls Royce of streaming devices with a luxurious feel and all the fixins. It supports Dolby Vision HDR for higher-quality visuals on certain Netflix shows. It also enables iPhone users to stream from the Netflix app using the AirPlay button. The device was updated earlier this year with a faster processor (which is great for playing games) and an upgraded remote. $180 at Amazon

One more option: Upgrade to a smart TV

If you're going to buy a new TV anyway chances are it will have an up-to-date smart TV system. Our favorite is Roku TV. It's easy to use and it offers the most comprehensive selection of streaming services out there. And it's cheaper and more readily available than a new Xbox Series X or PlayStation 5 with prices starting around $150.

Check out our list of the best TVs -- all of them are smart TVs with Netflix built-in.

Every one of Jabra’s true wireless releases has been universally praised from the introductory Elite 65t to the noise-cancelling Elite 85t. In fact several of them even outperform the AirPods and AirPods Pro in key categories (e.g. battery life fit sound). Expanding their presence in the true wireless market the brand has overhauled their lineup and announced not one but three new models: the Elite 7 Pro Elite 7 Active and the Elite 3.

Up first is the $79 Elite 3 the cheapest wireless earbuds that Jabra has ever released. These newbies are similar in style to previous Elite models but with a more distinctive look while also bearing an impressive spec sheet for the price. Notables include ambient listening Bluetooth 5.2 Google Fast Pair rainproof protection and customized sound via a companion app.

Some big features are missing that keep it from being the complete package but the Jabra Elite 3 still offers enough to be considered the best wireless earbuds value out there.

Jabra Elite 3 review: Availability and price

The Jabra Elite 3 is currently sold for $79 and is available at major online retailers including Amazon and Best Buy or directly from Jabra. You can purchase it in four colors: Dark Grey Light Grey Lilac and Navy. Bundled with the purchase are a charging case USB-C charging cable three sets of different-sized EarGels tips and a warranty.

With such a low MSRP the Elite 3 undercuts numerous rivals at different price points. Some that come to mind are inexpensive offerings like the Anker Soundcore LibertyAir 2 Pro (currently on sale for $84 at Best Buy) mid-tier gems like the Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 ($149) and heavyweights like the AirPods Pro ($249) and Sony WF-1000XM4 ($279). Furthermore these wireless earbuds can be had for less than some of Jabra’s more popular models: the Elite Active 75t ($149) and Elite 85t ($179).

Jabra Elite 3 review: Design and comfort

While previous Elite wireless earbuds featured an oval shape the Elite 3 has a more abstract appearance with a triangular design that’s both eye-catching and conflicting. It’s won’t appeal to everyone. Either way these buds are as well built as their predecessors. The sturdy plastic casing can sustain beatings and won’t shatter if you drop them from a considerable height. An IP55 rating means the buds can survive sweat rain and dust ingress.

Jabra’s signature style cues haven’t been forgotten either. Peep the airbrushed logo on the front matte finish flush buttons and bold color options.

The charging case is kept compact and portable-friendly another staple of the Elite series. You can store it in any denim pocket or carry-on bag without feeling weighed down. Build quality isn’t as fancy as older models settling for a thinner plastic frame versus the premium plastic chassis found on the Elite Active 75t. The lid is also flimsy though the magnet is strong enough to keep the case shut when on the move.

(Image credit: Regan Coule/Future)

Jabra refers to the Elite 3’s in-ear design as “noise-isolating” and that’s pretty accurate. The angled sound port seamlessly inserts into the canal and the patented EarGels tips produce a tight seal for optimal fit.

(Image credit: Regan Coule/Future)

Comfort is fine with the buds resting gently on the concha for long stretches. I wore them moderately throughout the day sometimes up to 3 hours straight before feeling the slightest soreness. Those with a high pain threshold likely won’t feel anything.

Jabra Elite 3 review: Controls and digital assistant

An updated design should warrant updated controls. Right? Guess again. Jabra keeps it old school with multifunctional buttons that support a full suite of media controls and input methods. I’m talking playback call management volume digital assistance one-touch Spotify playback and listening mode activation which can all be enabled through tap/hold gestures. The buttons respond well to engagement and produce nice tactility with every press.

I’m not sure why Jabra chose to exclude MyControls from the features list. This would have given users the ability to map out the controls on each bud to their liking. Another missing feature is on-ear detection to auto-pause when removing the buds from your ears.

(Image credit: Regan Coule/Future)

Google Assistant Alexa Siri and Bixby are all compatible with the Elite 3. The four-mic array demonstrates great speech recognition and is intelligible recognizing every syllable and voice command while each AI bot responds quickly to inquiries. The app lets you swap out the digital assistant function for Spotify activation; performing a double press on the left earbud will enter and play music from the streaming service.

Jabra Elite 3 review: Audio quality

One would assume that a cheaper price would compromise audio quality. The Elite 3 proves that theory wrong. Jabra’s tiny 6mm speakers pump out dynamic clear sound with punchy bass that doesn’t become too overwhelming even when vibing out to boom-heavy soundtracks.

The thumping drum break at the start of NaS’ “N.Y. State of Mind” remains constant throughout the track blending beautifully with the sulking piano bass for one mean head-nodding session. Taking the low end up a notch I blasted the Red Hot Chili Peppers’ “Around the World” and was met with Flea’s gnarly distorted bass intro which was reproduced surprisingly well along with the funkified drums and thrilling guitar riffs near the end.

I must admit that the detailing on these buds is what caught my attention the most. Have you ever listened to a song multiple times then suddenly noticed a detail that you never heard before? Yea that was me with a couple of tracks. To hear the adlibbing on the hook of A Tribe Called Quest’s “I Left My Wallet in El Segundo” was trippy but really satisfying especially since I had never caught it when testing several other sub-$100 wireless earbuds.

(Image credit: Regan Coule/Future)

Mids and highs are also given proper representation. You can put on any Jazz classic and get a feel for them. My selection was Duke Ellington & John Coltrane’s “In A Sentimental Mood” which fed my ears melodic piano chords sultry horns and steady prominent hi-hats.

The low end is more powerful on other Jabra buds but you have the option to increase it in the Jabra Sound+ app where there are six different EQs to choose from: Neutral (the default) Bass Boost Speech Treble Boost Smooth and Energize. The option to manually adjust frequencies and create your own sound profile is exclusive to higher-priced Elite models. Luckily all these EQs work well when paired with the right music genre or content. Speech improves vocal clarity on videos and podcasts whereas Smooth and Treble Boost add more depth to orchestral tracks. Bass Boost is a bit aggressive but will please hard rock and hip-hop lovers and Energize has EDM written all over it.

Despite the lack of active noise cancellation the Elite 3 does a formidable job of isolating external noises from entering the soundscape. Listening to music around the house I managed to block out my infant’s cries and any adult conversations taking place in the same room. Outside was just as rewarding with wind interference kept to a minimum.

Jabra Elite 3 review: App and special features

I’m a huge advocate of Jabra Sound+ mainly because it was one of the first companion apps to introduce what were originally considered game-changing features like an ambient listening mode (HearThrough) and the aforementioned EQ. Not many brands are willing to grant app access for their entry-level buds so tip your hat to Jabra for their generosity.

HearThrough is available right out of the box and can be enabled directly on the buds or in the app. For those unfamiliar with the feature this opens the mics to pipe in more exterior sounds and increase your awareness of surroundings. It’s useful in multiple scenarios such as eavesdropping on conversations hearing traffic or keeping tabs on your baby when in his playpen just a few feet away which was how I managed to multitask most of the time.

(Image credit: Regan Coule/Future)

Call Experience returns and optimizes call quality by increasing how loud and deep your voice sounds on calls. You’ll find it hidden in the Headset settings. One other feature you’ll have to go searching for in the back end is Video Conference. Apparently this allows you to use the Sound+ app as a remote control for a Jabra video conferencing device. I’m still waiting on confirmation from Jabra on whether this feature is compatible with their wireless earbuds.

There is also a find my buds function to help locate misplaced buds along with a battery level indicator and firmware updates.

(Image credit: Regan Coule/Future)

This is an adequate number of features to have at your disposal. It’s just that Jabra has several other perks available that would have taken functionality to the next level. Was I expecting advanced features like ANC or MySound to create a sound profile that’s tailored to my hearing? Not for $79. On the other hand features like MyControls and Soundscapes to mask ambient noise with nature sounds seemed ideal for inclusion.

Jabra Elite 3 review: Battery life and charging case

Jabra rates battery life at 7 hours on a single charge. Factor in high volume ambient listening and heavy streaming playtime drops by about 30 to 45 minutes. Do the math and you’ll see the Elite 3 lasts longer than either the AirPods (5 hours) or AirPods Pro (5 hours with ANC off) but also runs shorter than the Galaxy Buds 2 (7.5 hours with ANC off) and a handful of other rivals. This is still sufficient and equates to about 4 days of moderate use daily (1.5 hours) before tossing into the charging case.

(Image credit: Regan Coule/Future)

Speaking of which the charging case holds up to 28 hours giving you 4 extra charges on the go. Fast charging is strong with a 10-minute charge generating 1 hour of playback. I just wish that Jabra would have added wireless charging especially since there are several Amazon darlings out there that come with the feature that are offered for the same price (check out the Anker Soundcore Life P3).

Jabra Elite 3 review: Call quality and connectivity

The Elite 3 upholds Jabra’s credibility as one of the premier calling headset makers out there. Several people complimented how loud and clear I sounded on phone calls both indoors and outdoors. Ambient noises such as crying babies and whisking cars are audible but my wife stated that they weren’t distracting as her attention remained on the conversation at hand.

Jabra also designed the Elite 3 to be used in either stereo or mono mode meaning you can use one bud for calls or music listening while the other charges.

(Image credit: Regan Coule/Future)

Bluetooth 5.2 does a solid job of maintaining a strong and reliable connection. I got to enjoy about 40 feet of wireless listening walking from room to room without any dropout or stutter. Google Fast Pair expedited the pairing process with all my Android devices. My MacBook Pro and my wife’s iPhone 12 picked up the Bluetooth signal to connect instantly as well.

The buds can be paired with up to six devices. To be clear I don’t mean at the same time. That would suggest that the Elite 3 comes with multipoint technology which it doesn’t. The Elite 3 does have some of the fastest auto-connect capabilities I’ve tested on a pair of wireless earbuds. When disconnecting from a recognized device it will connect to the next available recognized device without delay.

Jabra Elite 3 review: Verdict

The Elite 3 is a fantastic bargain for those who want something cheaper from the brand but just as good as some of their older models. It’s also a suitable AirPods alternative. Sound is satisfying with vibrant loud sonics blasting through the tiny speakers. The ability to personalize whatever you hear through well-engineered presets is a sweet bonus. HearThrough is one of the better transparency modes out there and it’s nice to see that Jabra hasn’t tampered with it. Battery life is also plentiful and call quality is remarkable.

Of course a premium is usually required to bask in all of Jabra’s perks and the Elite 3 is the odd man out. Proprietary modes were left off to accommodate the lower price point. In addition the absence of other modern features (e.g. multipoint technology wireless charging) seemed like missed opportunities for the Elite 3 to obliterate other inexpensive competitors some of which offer said features and cost less.

But to invest in the Elite 3 is to invest in the brand experience and though it isn’t fully present it’s still superior to what’s out there in the cheap wireless earbuds market.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3N3ZWVrLmNvbS8xMy1iZXN0LXBsYWNlcy1idXktZW5nYWdlbWVudC1yaW5ncy1vbmxpbmUtMTYyNTk0N9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The 13 Best Places to Buy Engagement Rings Online,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.newsweek.com/13-best-places-buy-engagement-rings-online-1625947 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3N3ZWVrLmNvbS8xMy1iZXN0LXBsYWNlcy1idXktZW5nYWdlbWVudC1yaW5ncy1vbmxpbmUtMTYyNTk0N9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

That doesn’t by any means make Mr. Rieder the CIO for the world’s largest asset management company (with $9 trillion in assets under management) an all-out Bitcoin bull.

He cautioned that the bitcoin price is very volatile and questioned the alternative asset thesis that bitcoin makes a good hedge.

Why The BlackRock CIO Is Long BTC

During the Squawk Box segment Rieder said:

“First of all I’ll say on crypto— people describe it as a hedge or alternative. I’m not sure it’s a really great hedge. I mean the correlation to equities the correlation to risk assets. I’m not sure it’s a great hedge.”

Adding:

“By the way— so when an asset moves ten to fifteen percent a day it’s really hard to hedge big organic asset pools with that as a hedge.”

But Rieder’s still bullish Bitcoin and told viewers why he keeps a moderate long Bitcoin position in his portfolio:

“Listen I’ve said… part of why I own a small piece of bitcoin is I do think there are more people that are going to enter that fray over time. We have a very moderate position in our portfolio. I like assets quite frankly that are volatile that have upside convexity and I could see bitcoin like it’s done. I could see it go up significantly.”

Rieder also clarified that he doesn’t believe Bitcoin is a “core asset” like fixed income (bonds) or equities (stocks). He just thinks the digital currency is still early along in its market adoption curve appreciates the upside ahead for the Bitcoin price and considers the volatility a plus for his purposes.

Last month BlackRock invested $383 million USD in two bitcoin mining firms through its mutual funds and exchange-traded funds to support bitcoin exposure for its clients.

Give how the price of bitcoin has risen Rieder probably wishes BlackRock had made that move last November when he predicted that bitcoin will largely replace gold.

Rough Week For Bitcoin’s Price

It’s been a rough week for bitcoin traders with the 5-day Bitcoin price down over 11% briefly dipping below $45000 on liquid exchange markets Friday.

As it turned out “Bitcoin Day” this week the day the cryptocurrency was adopted as legal tender in El Salvador saw the steepest bitcoin price capitulation since the rout after the all-time high levels in May. The coin’s worst day in four months saw some $330 billion USD wiped from its total market cap in under 24 hours.

Investing.com – Soho China Ltd.'s (HK:0410) Hong Kong shares plummeted after a $3 billion takeover bid by Blackstone Group Inc. (NYSE:BX) ended in failure.

Shares plummeted 34.86% to HK$2.28 ($0.29) by 1:02 AM ET (5:02 AM GMT) on Monday after falling up to 40% earlier in the session.

Blackstone’s decision against moving ahead with the acquisition was Soho’s second failed attempt in selling itself. Progress in satisfying Blackstone’s preconditions of the offer was insufficient Soho said in a statement to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on Friday in explaining the reason behind the failure.

On the market since early 2020 Soho was banking on profits from a sale to help ease the pressure from a lack of new pipeline assets and declining office rents in key Chinese cities on its profits. It is also dealing with an intensifying crackdown on developers that are leaving them with a tight liquidity position.

Blackstone made an offer to acquire Soho for as much as HK$23.7 billion or $3.05 billion subject to regulatory approval in June 2021. China’s State Administration for Market Regulation formally accepted the deal for review in August 2021.

The HK$5 per-share offer in June representing a 31.6% premium was announced by Blackrock (NYSE:BLK) in June 2021. Blackrock and Soho concluded that the pre-conditions could not be satisfied before the long-stop date but the date would not be extended the statement said.

Founded by Chairman Pan Shiyi and Chief Executive Officer Zhang Xin in 1995 Soho’s key assets include the Bund SOHO and Wangjing SOHO office buildings in Shanghai and Beijing respectively.

It was the biggest little Burning Man ever and the general feeling was that it was one of the best (non) Burns in years.



There were no roads there was no gate there were no Portos. And it was no problem. The worst did not happen.



And does this prove that the Org is not needed?



No. It proves that the shared community values that have been promulgated by Burning Man for so many years are strong enough to live on their own. It was as if the Burners grew up and left home this year. They could look mom and pop in the eye and say “We got this.”



The aftermath is still unfolding. Was there crap left behind? No doubt. But then there is ALWAYS crap left behind. Will there be an effort organized or not to clean it up? We have yet to see.



But we can say this: Most people the vast majority kept their shit tight both literally and figuratively. There was little to no MOOP blowing in the breeze. People picked up things that needed to be picked up whether they belonged to them or not.



There was no Black Rock City this year as Jeremy Crandell summarized so neatly but there was indeed Burning Man.



People say oh this was like the good old days when Burning Man was small and free. We are going to say no it was not like the old days. There wasn’t the mayhem there wasn’t the danger there wasn’t the wildness. Oh and the LEDs and sound systems are completely next level now. But the point is the patterns of behavior held. Hell even the shape of the city looked like Burning Man. People watched out for each other. They shared experiences they cooked tri-tip and gave it away to hundreds of people. They put on dance parties. They made it fun.



For the MOST part the dirt bikers and side-by-sides stayed out in the far playa. All the crazy that didn’t happen all the organization all the MOOP sweeping and all the personal porto buckets were there because of the culture that has developed around Burning Man over the past 35 years.

It did not start out this way. The push for some measure of safety at the event eventually split apart the group that started Burning Man on Baker Beach. What survived was the notion that if you are going to throw a giant party in the desert you bear some responsibility for the outcome.



And this value is held so deeply in the consciousness and ethos of Burning Man that the Org wasn’t necessary this year. The right things happened because veteran Burners made them happen. What do they say about an effective leader in a corporation? If they do a good job they make themselves unnecessary. For this desert campout for this Burning Man Country Fair (thanks Paul) for this DIY Burn the underlying and accepted principles of the Burner community made it possible. Plan B is already taking feedback and thinking about next steps. Gosh that kind of sounds like an AfterBurn report and where have we heard that term before?



The next logical question is can what happened in Black Rock this year scale? I would say that it’s doubtful. What is possible for 13000 or so people to do is not the same as trying to do it with 80000 people.

A brief sidebar on the numbers: Wally Bomgaars who has done population studies for Burning Man who founded a security firm for big events like this who took drone shots of the playa each and every morning this year who studied traffic patterns in Gerlach estimates that a TOTAL of about 13000 people attended the event. The peak population according to his analysis was about 11000 on Saturday night. (If you were there you know that many people arrived early in the week and left before the weekend.) Even with these unofficial numbers this was a much much smaller gathering than recent Burns.



And what about COVID? Was this a super spreader event? We don’t know that yet either. But we do know this: The Org made the right call in cancelling the official Burn for all the right reasons. It is one thing to camp with your friends out in the vastness of the playa. It is entirely another thing to ask 1000 core crew members to live and work in close proximity for six weeks or so to put on the big show. And it was the right call not to ask big art makers and theme camp organizers to pull their people together in the middle of a pandemic.



People ask how can you spend all this time and energy and resources in the middle of a pandemic to put on Burning Man?



The only people who went to the desert this year were the ones who had the wherewithal to do so. Going there has evolved into a time-consuming and expensive proposition. It takes a lot to participate there. Not everyone is able to take part. It has always been thus and will always be thus. Radical Inclusion is one of the 10 Principles but not everyone will always be able to take advantage of being welcome to join.

A QUEST

The three women looked most definitely out of place.



It was midweek and two of them had never even been to Burning Man before. And now here they were in Bruno’s getting a snack before going on a supply run.



“Can you tell me where the nearest Walmart is?” Lucy the one sitting next to me asked.



We almost didn’t want to tell her that they were about an hour and a half away. We also knew that the closest Walmarts in Fernley and Sparks had been wiped out of supplies by other wanna-Burners on their way to the desert.



And we thought this is exactly why this whole Rogue Burn thing was such a bad idea. All kinds of people would be drawn to a wild and free Burning Man and they wouldn’t have a clue about how to take care of themselves. Or take care of the desert.



But we were wrong about that.



When I first heard about the unofficial gathering that was going to take place in the Black Rock Desert during the time when Burning Man would normally happen I mostly didn’t want any part of it.



It’d be a bunch of anti-vaxxer maskholes and “conspiritualists.” It’d be people with axes to grind and chips on their shoulders. “You can’t take my burn away! I’ll do what I want!” It’d be a literal shitshow by the ill-informed and the ill-intentioned not to mention the unprepared.



Of course that was part of the attraction too. No one had any idea what was actually going to happen. It could be scary and dangerous. Who would want to miss that?

But then something amazing and maybe wonderful began to take place. People started to step up and take charge. The Black Rock Plan B group was formed on Facebook and some knowledgeable veterans began sharing information that could lead the way to a safe and responsible gathering .



Still this had every chance of turning into a disaster. The BLM restrictions had said that fireworks were not allowed but they had said nothing about firearms. They spelled out what kind of structures could be built and what kind of vehicles were allowed but they said nothing about speed limits.

Anyway after we told Lucy how far away the Walmarts were we asked her what she needed. “Well we’d like to get some bikes. … And you know just some stuff to eat.”



Oh well that was actually pretty easy. The Empire store was only about five minutes away and they had gotten lots of extra supplies. And the container park across the street from them was selling bikes. So no there was no reason to be gone for half a day. But because she’d never been here before we couldn’t help but ask:



“So what made you decide to come this year?”



She got a look on her face pushed away her onion rings and told her story. Earlier this year her best friend Austin had gotten down on one knee and proposed that they go to Burning Man together. “It was so romantic” she said. She had been wanting to go for 10 years and this was the year it was finally going to happen.



And then a month ago Austin died from a fentanyl overdose. That’s the other pandemic going on right now; many drugs are being cut with fentanyl and it’s a deadly risk not to test your substances. Austin her Burning Man partner-to-be was gone.



But that made her only more determined to attend even though she’d have to go alone. “I have a purpose to be here for sure. … I was really hoping there would be a temple that I could go to to honor him. … I broke down crying a couple of times getting here. I’m being totally sober and just feeling it.



“I really appreciate architecture and I feel like there’s a piece of that missing. … However I’m so blessed to be here it’s a dream come true to … meet all the Burners and connect with everyone and with the energy. … It’s very moving and beautiful.”



We’re hoping that Lucy found one of the small Temples that eventually were constructed on the playa.



Edit: Lucy contacted us this week to say that she did in fact find a temple and she sent along a picture showing that she was able to honor her friend with a drawing and a note:

THE FLY RANCH BURN

A Man did burn Saturday night after all. Like last year Burning Man Project got permission to burn a Man on its private land at Hualapai Playa part of its Fly Ranch property.



There was the expected outcry when news of the Burn began to circulate. “Oh that’s for the 1 percent. Oh that’s for First Camp. Oh that’s for the Plug and Plays.”



Well no.



The permit allowed for limited attendance so the selection process started with Goatt who did most of the Man build himself and some of the Man Krew who helped coordinate the effort. And then there was the technical crew that was in charge of delivering a livestream so that everyone could see the Burn.



Marian Goodell Burning Man Project’s CEO decided earlier in the week to send out an electronic sign-up sheet to staffers and volunteers who had been in Gerlach for most of the summer working on various projects that are aimed at improving Burning Man’s presence in the community and making the event more sustainable. We filled out the form and crossed our fingers and we got word late Friday that we’d be able to go.



The air had been pretty decent on the playa all week. The fires that you could never totally get out of your mind had sent drifting clouds of smoke over the desert but it hadn’t been the choking 300 AQI of previous weeks. But on Saturday evening the gloom descended again as the sky turned a brooding deep crimson.



“We are honoring our oldest most central ritual” Stuart Mangrum told the group over a megaphone. He was telling the crowd to be quiet because “We want the sound that they hear (on the livestream) to be the sound of wind and the sound of fire.”



And so we sat in silence as Crimson carried a bowl of flames to the base of the Man then lit his legs on fire. Dave X and his pyro crew had implanted what looked like red flares near the Man’s heart and extremities and soon the effigy was fully engulfed in flames. As you sat and watched in silence it felt like you were keeping vigil.

“It was my 28th burn” Will Roger said later “so of course I brought many memories intentions and wonderment with me. It’s become my New Year’s celebration. … Release transformation transmuting wordless awe.”



Just a few miles away in the Black Rock Desert drones were creating a glowing 100-foot image of the Man and music from Robot Heart and other art cars sent the crowd by all accounts into a fittingly raucous Burn Night celebration.



“So we’ve got people over there” Marian said gesturing toward the Black Rock playa “who are having a party and there are witnesses here of something very beautiful and there are a hundred thousand people watching online and it’s all as meaningful no matter where you’re at.”



The silence and the flames and the setting had put Marian in a contemplative mood “And for the Man Burn that’s not something you normally get. I usually sit at the Man Burn going oh my god it’s over!”



Did this one remind her of previous Burns? Was it a throwback?



“Well I thought of Larry” she said. “I remember my first Burn with Larry holding his hand and I had gone to two Burns (previously) and now I was sitting with him and I loved that man. … And we were quiet! I remember just holding hands.”



And what about what was going on at the other Burn?



“Well I was looking at it as an organizer and there would be no roads and terrible things would happen and my girlfriend said—and I told her I’d credit her because I hadn’t thought about it this way—she said people needed it so badly people needed the connection so badly. It doesn’t matter if there are roads or streets it doesn’t matter if there’s no Man Burn … it’s the need to connect.



“People keep asking what’s the future going to be like and I say I’m going to keep doing Black Rock City unless people tell me to stop because (the other event) is not the way to build a society. That’s a super fun radical birthday party.”



As we drove away we could still see the embers from the now-small fire out on the Hualapai. Heading back to the desert we were happy that at least somewhere the flames the honest-to-god actual flames were still burning.

There were lots of janky mutant vehicles on the playa this year ones that never would have passed a BRC DMV inspection. And they were charming and fun and it was great that they could roam around. The “Side Porch” was here the little cousin of the iconic Front Porch art car. The BAAAHS car was also there in slimmed-down form and at one point they were doing a mashup of Martin Luther King’s “I have a dream” speech over techno and insanely it worked perfectly.



And there were a ton of things going on all around the playa. There were dance camps great DJs food and drink given away massages yoga … a lot.



But to these eyes at least much as we admired the skill and effort and creativity of the comparatively smaller productions we did miss the big stuff. “Participation” and “Radical Self-expression” are named values of Burning Man culture and call us spectators if you must but we missed all the things that make us say “Wow.” There was a lot to enjoy but there just wasn’t a lot that was awesome. This was a great campout with great people and the Burning Man way of treating each other was very much in evidence but it simply was not Black Rock City. Fight me.



Maybe you prefer the smaller scale. You no doubt prefer the free admission. And the people that you met still somehow turned out to be the people that you needed to meet. But we will say it again: We missed the wow.



And we will also say this: If you had to get on or off the playa especially at night it wasn’t easy. On Saturday night we saw cars all over the playa some heading sideways across the desert some aiming for the shoreline but not where there were any access points. Were those people lost? Were they just motoring around because they could? There’s no way of knowing. But because there was smoke in the sky and you couldn’t see the stars or the hills it was not easy to find your way.



There were also people who loved being able to drive fast on the playa day or night. And that was scary. If you got behind someone sending up a plume of dust you were blinded for as long as it took for the dust to settle.



And we’ll also say this: Without streets and placed camps you couldn’t find the people that you might have wanted to find. The camps that separated themselves from the main areas were easier to locate with the help of the What Three Words app. You could go three miles out almost to Trego to visit Spanky’s WIne Bar and listen to the Bootie Mashup but if you wanted to find your pals from Gate you had virtually no chance.



We loved that all of the artists and Burning Man Project workers were having maybe the best Burn they’d had in a very long time because they for once didn’t have a million things to do. They could explore have fun actually go to Burning Man.



We don’t for a second mean to diminish in any way the huge achievements that were accomplished here — the camp that served hundreds of pounds of barbecue tri-tip the killer music camps the fantastic lighting setup at Reverbia. But it wasn’t the same. And that’s fine because maybe you like it that way. And maybe if there is an official Black Rock City next year this is what Fourth of Juplaya might want to be.



For us though as good as this Self-inflicted Burn was and as great as it was to feel the connection with the creative community again we missed Black Rock City. We want it to come back. We want to see you at this same time next year.

Rather it is a crowdsourced gathering focused on art community and alternative — and many would argue better — ways of existing in a society.

But any way you swing your fire spinner the fact remains that there is a lot of music at Burning Man with DJs in particular serving as a primary source of entertainment out on the playa.

This year that was the same and also different given that the official Burning Man was canceled and a “Free Burn” event drawing roughly 15000 people happened in its place. It looked like Burning Man; it felt like Burning Man but it many ways it did not sound like Burning Man with the lack of centralized organization creating key differences in regards to musical offerings.

But the freewheeling nature of this year’s “non-event” did not make for a lesser sonic experience and in ways Free Burn actually offered a refreshingly voyage journey into sound. These are five reasons why.

No Massive Stages

Several sound camps on the esplanade — the inner ring of the giant circle at the center of Burning Man — have grown significantly in size during the past few years with the biggest featuring setups comparable in scale to some of the bigger stages at Coachella. While these stages are often beautifully designed and good hubs for seeing higher-profile artists swarming to and around them in order to catch a set can create a sort of hectic overcrowded feeling that’s out of sync with the generally more go-with-the-flow spirit of Burning Man. This clusterf— vibe is especially pronounced when hundreds of bikes are parked in front of these stages during a particularly popular set. Given the size of these stages the quality of experience can also feel compromised particularly when so many more intimately sized events are happening throughout Burning Man.

Were these big stages on the playa during Free Burn? Nope! With the temporary restrictions issued by the Bureau of Land Management barring the building of any such structures the esplanade (which despite the lack of officially sanctioned infrastructure was still a perfect circle) instead featured more bespoke experiences. These included for example the small tent featuring a Dolly Parton altar and 60 or so people getting super duper down to remixes of classics by P!nk Destiny’s Child Will Smith and other late ’90s and early 2000s icons. This more homespun experience and others like it were delightful discoveries. And given that camps didn’t have to apply for permits to be on the playa and anyone could just roll up and do their thing these were also finds that would have likely been harder to come across had they been competing with the monolithic stages on-site in other years.

No Big Name DJ Chasing

Cycling hurriedly across the playa to catch a set by Carl Cox or Damian Lazarus or Above & Beyond or Diplo or Flume or Slander or Skrillex or Rüfüs Du Sol or whatever other marquee act you heard is playing at whatever given stage or art car can be exciting sure. It can also be time consuming physically draining and a distraction from the many other lesser-known massively talented DJs one might otherwise discover playing at a random art car or smaller camp.

A few stars like Diplo and Lee Burridge did make the trek to Free Burn (respect) where they both played on the Robot Heart art car (with Diplo leaning hard into his deep house-oriented Higher Ground output while playing tracks like the Angelos remix of his own “One By One”) beyond that there were few big names and almost no official lineups. (Sound camps often post lineups on signs for passersby to see although posting them online before Burning Man itself is typically frowned upon.) This year’s singular nature provided lesser-known artists a chance to shine and all of us who’d typically bike for miles in an effort to see the artists we see at most other major festivals anyways a more go-with-the-flow discovery-style experience.

Fewer Options Less FOMO

While it’s sort of bratty to experience FOMO at all whilst attending Burning Man an event many people in the world would love to experience if given the chance it does happen. With so much going on musically one is bound to miss something great and hearing your campmates expound on the out of body experience they had while contact dancing at the Mayan Warrior during sunset can make one feel slightly sour if one wasn’t also there. But this year fewer options meant fewer things to miss out on and if something big was happening you probably knew about it beforehand. This included the aforementioned sets by Diplo Burridge and Ry X on Robot Heart. One of the only major art cars on the playa this year Robot Heart’s fabled daily sunrise parties were major gathering points and sleeping through any of them did arouse mild feelings of regret.

Less Playa Tech

In the last decade the prevailing genre of music at Burning Man has become a style of tech-house commonly referred to as “Playa Tech.” It’s ultra minimal and it’s everywhere from ad hoc deep playa stages to the biggest art cars to the vibiest sunrise sets where the sound facilitates the opportunity to stand in place for upwards of six hours while nodding one’s head slightly with eyes closed. Is it bad? Not at all. Has its prevalence become a bit tired? One could make that argument. But this year with Free Burn creating so many switch-ups in terms of what artists and sound camps were there the playa tech was much less abundant clearing the desert airwaves for a greater diversity of sound.

More Of Everything Else

While it’s certainly possible to hear hip-hop psych rock soul jazz and genres beyond dance/electronic at any given Burning Man this year — with many of the usual suspects not present — space was opened for a greater diversity of sound. This meant not only the aforementioned pop music (usually a scarce resource on the playa) but the hip-hop sets booming from myriad art cars the psychedelic rock being performed from the top of a bus on the esplanade Friday night — this six-person group’s cover of The Doors‘ “Break On Through (To the Other Side”) was particularly righteous — and the DJ and a very petite art car who fused tribal house with Dolly Parton’s “Jolene.” There was no lack of electronic music either with legitimately excellent trance house bass techno progressive house and other genres booming from camps across the gathering.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlyaXNoZXhhbWluZXIuY29tL3Byb3BlcnR5L3Jlc2lkZW50aWFsL2FyaWQtNDA2OTQ3MDIuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,First resale at Botanika is a €635k semi-d - and it's not half bad,"Promises made when Cork’s upmarket scheme Botanika launched on the city’s suburban Blackrock Road back in 2017 have been delivered on.

So says Michael Downey the selling agent of the very first resale to come to the market in the scheme of 31 recent-builds No 14 Botanika.

14 Botanika is a south-facing four-bed home by Cleve Hill

The bad news for those with lots and lots of money to spend on a Blackrock area family home is that No 14 isn’t one of the bigger detacheds which sold day one at prices up to €850000.

The good news for those with ‘just’ lots of money is that No 14 a four-bed semi-d is ‘relatively affordable’ for the location: it’s priced at €635000.

But ‘priced from’ might be a better descriptor as it’s likely to have very active interest and most likely bidding above the guide as has become the norm in recent years when good stock comes along in strong locations.

Sale agreed at €970000 is No 33 Lindville Ballintemple

L

Case in point? No 33 Lindville a 2780 sq ft detached 500 metres from Botanika came to market in June with a €875000 AMV with agent Behan Irwin Gosling and we speculated in these pages that it might tip the €1m mark. Turns out it came close going nearly €100k over the ‘relatively modest; guide sale agreed at €9700000.

Kitchen/diner

Back at this Botanika home nearly two decades younger: the €635k guide is on a 1550 sq ft home south facing with city/St Luke’s/Montenotte views to the back over the south docks where renewal has already started and public park provision well in hand by the Marina and Páirc Uí Chaoimh.

City views from the back of 14 Botanika

Set between Ballintemple and Victoria Road and an easy walk on the flat to the city it’s in as-new nick left part-furnished for its sale via agents ERA Downey McCarthy who have won the bragging rights to Botanika’s first resale. It won’t just be the other residents interested to see how it fares: there’s wider interest in what was one of Cork’s first ‘luxury’ schemes to come along post-market recovery.

ERA’s Michael Downey quotes developer’s Citidwell’s original sales boast when Botanika was first launched to a much-recovered residential market in a flurry of marketing hyperbole and with the spelling ‘Botanika’ with a ‘k’’ deliberate to catch some sort of perceived zeitgeist.

Then the spiel spoke of “an exclusive enclave of generous detached and semi-detached luxury homes in a leafy verdant and utterly private setting off the Blackrock Road. Sophisticated spacious and refined these family homes in the heart of sought-after Blackrock sensitively designed and impeccably built are a rare and lasting legacy.”

Come 2021 with all spoken for and the Price Register showing the prices of 29 (at least one was kept by one of the Citidwell developers as his private family home) ERA’s Mr Downey adds “it’s fair to say that they did not disappoint in their delivery.”

Indeed and from the brick and limestone entrance pillars in Botanika with its dash and brick facades does indeed look the business with some retained mature trees and additional landscaping by Cunnane Stratton Reynolds in a development set inside the Cleve Hill estate with an easy walk of Cork City centre and with the Marina and amenity walks also close to hand and foot.

About half of Botanika's 31 homes are detacheds

No 14’s vendors haven’t fallen out with Botanika by the way: they’ve traded up within the development to one of the fifteen 2380 sq ft detacheds.

While it’s not confirmed it’s likely that the owners of No 14 have bought No 17 the very last of the detacheds to sell and which is the latest listing on the Price Register at €885000.

That’s a tidy bit over the initial averages for this type which ranged from €820000 to €850000 with one making €865000 by 2019.

The vast majority of sales were only recorded post-2019 as the ambitious scheme on a very expensive and difficult site ran behind schedule finishing out.

Botanika included two three-bed semis and the balance then was four-bed semis of 1550 sq ft which sold for under and over the €600k mark: No 14 the first to come for resale shows in 2019 at €595000.

Internally and upwards mobile at Botanika....

So in effect No 14’s owners are now making a €290000 trade up move from semi-d status to detached and gaining an extra 830 sq ft or 50% more space along the way. For those who want to see more number crunching that’s about €290 per square foot extra a nice bit below the c €350 psf the detached originally sold at.

So what of No 14 itself? Well it’s like brand new vacated basically furnished at ground level only so viewers and prospective buyers can easily imagine their own stamp and possessions on and in it.

Living room

In terms of layout it’s quite standard of four-bed semis of the past decade with rear kitchen/diner full width with front reception room with stove in a fire surround while the bulk of heating comes from air-to-water sources and is underfloor at ground level with quality rads upstairs.

Ceiling heights are bit above standard allowing for 7’ doors and there’s a utility and guest WC at ground with four bedrooms above main en suite plus family bathroom with sanitary ware and tiling at an above spec standard too.

Other features include wiring for fibre broadband and cable TV Sky) and alarm heritage-style sash windows good sound/acoustic insulation aluclad sliding rear patio door highly secure front door slate roof and part brick façade with easy keep wet dash on the balance.

The gardens have had some landscaping with fenced (not walled) back boundary there’s a shed and rear patio with off-street parking in front on a cobbled for several cars/SUVs.

VERDICT: There’ll be a raft of new home hunters curious to check out a finished Botanika home as well as others who didn’t jump back a few years ago when most were sold off the plans in one single phase so there were no price increases in later releases."
BX,Blackstone,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmpwb3N0LmNvbS81MC1tb3N0LWluZmx1ZW50aWFsLWpld3MveWlmYXQtb3Jvbi02NzgxNTDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Meet Blackstone Israel's secret weapon,"Yifat Oron captured a lot of attention this summer when Blackstone one of the world’s largest investment firms chose her to head its new office in Tel Aviv. But with more than 20 years of experience as a tech investor and executive in Israel Oron has already been driving innovation in Israel’s tech sector for many years.

“I grew up in Israel but my parents moved to New York when I was 16 which was very fortunate” Oron said. “I was able to defer my army service while I studied at the University of Pennsylvania in a dual-program of engineering and finance a combination that would become the theme of my career. When I came back for the army I did officer school and then joined the Defense Ministry’s Directorate of R&D (MAFAT) where they are developing defense technology projects that are 10-20 years ahead of their time.”

Eventually Oron landed a job with JPMorgan Chase and then came back to Israel to found a venture capital fund Vertex Partners working with early-stage startups. Then in 2013 a new opportunity opened up.

“I met a gentleman from Bank Leumi who said he was trying to figure out how to get the banking system more exposed to the Start-up Nation” Oron said. “This was a time when the Israeli economy was split between the tech sector and everything else and most of the financing options available were from foreign lenders. The question was whether the banking system can be more a part of the tech ecosystem. I felt at the time that this was a project that could change the map for startups and I decided to join.” WE WERE intoxicated with technological innovation. (credit: Marvin Meyer/Unsplash)

As the CEO of LeumiTech Oron’s job was “to build a bank within a bank that would provide all of the needs of a tech company. It was very different than regular banks. Whatever an entrepreneur wants to start a company we would have it. We started growing very quickly and served a large part of the tech community. And not surprisingly the other banks soon did similar things.”

That innovation did wonders for the hi-tech sector as a whole Oron said. “In order to grow an industry you need to have all the necessary players in your ecosystem. Now the banks were competing to make it easier for startups offering more competitive rates and better services. I did that for seven years and it was very rewarding and industry-changing.”

It was after this that Oron was introduced to Blackstone a global equity firm with some $700 billion under management. The fit was right and the company announced in April that she would head the company’s new office here.

Blackstone’s decision to open an office in Tel Aviv instead of merely keeping tabs on the local scene reflects the changing reality in the local market and serves as a signal to others.

“The industry has evolved tremendously in recent years and when a company like Blackstone says that it thinks Israel is a place to be the ripple effect around the world is tremendous” Oron said. “The significance goes far beyond the deals we will do here. It shouts to the world that you need to know what is happening here.”

Most of Oron’s job now is looking for and making investments for the $4.5b. Blackstone Growth fund the firm’s growth equity business “Growth companies are often tech-oriented but they don’t have to be” she said. “We have already funded one company in the cybersecurity space Wiz and there will be many more coming. Our purpose is to help these companies grow to the next level and we have a lot of resources at our disposal around the world to do so. Among other things we are the largest real estate owner in the world and we have more than a billion square feet of logistics space.”

Oron is passionate about eliminating gender stereotypes that can hold women back.

“In Israel we have grown by about 1000% in the number of companies led by women” she said. “I get notes from women I have never met saying that the fact that Blackstone picked a woman to lead their office was very important for them. The world has changed in a huge way.”

But she said there is more work to be done. “In my home if someone would ask my daughter to describe her mother and father using all kinds of descriptive elements except for gender you wouldn’t be able to tell who’s a woman and who’s a man. Eliminating preconceptions is critical to reaching the full equilibrium between men and women. I hope that one day we won’t even have to talk about women in tech.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2JyZWFraW5ndmlld3MvYmxhY2tzdG9uZS1tb3Zlcy1vdXQtY2hpbmEtcHJvcGVydHktZGVhbC0yMDIxLTA5LTEzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Breakingviews - Blackstone moves out of China property deal,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/blackstone-moves-out-china-property-deal-2021-09-13/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2JyZWFraW5ndmlld3MvYmxhY2tzdG9uZS1tb3Zlcy1vdXQtY2hpbmEtcHJvcGVydHktZGVhbC0yMDIxLTA5LTEzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL3J1c3NlbGxmbGFubmVyeS8yMDIxLzA5LzEyL3NvaG8tY2hpbmEtYmlsbGlvbmFpcmUtY291cGxlLWxvc2Utc3VpdG9yLWFzLTMtYmxuLWFjcXVpc2l0aW9uLXRhbGtzLXdpdGgtYmxhY2tzdG9uZS1lbmQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Soho China Billionaire Couple Lose Suitor As $3 Bln Acquisition Talks With Blackstone End,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/russellflannery/2021/09/12/soho-china-billionaire-couple-lose-suitor-as-3-bln-acquisition-talks-with-blackstone-end/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL3J1c3NlbGxmbGFubmVyeS8yMDIxLzA5LzEyL3NvaG8tY2hpbmEtYmlsbGlvbmFpcmUtY291cGxlLWxvc2Utc3VpdG9yLWFzLTMtYmxuLWFjcXVpc2l0aW9uLXRhbGtzLXdpdGgtYmxhY2tzdG9uZS1lbmQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ldHJvd2VzdGRhaWx5bmV3cy5jb20vcGljdHVyZS1nYWxsZXJ5L3Nwb3J0cy8yMDIxLzA5LzExL3Bob3Rvcy1iZWxsaW5naGFtLWJtci1ob3BlZGFsZS1mb290YmFsbC84MzAxODI5MDAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,photos bellingham bmr-hopedale football,"SPORTS

In a joint statement with the developer controlled by mainland real estate personalities Pan Shiyi and Zhang Xin the two parties said they would not extend the schedule for Blackstone to purchase at least 54.93 percent of Soho’s Hong Kong-listed stock noting that China’s State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) had not yet approved the transaction.

That approval from the mainland anti-monopoly bureau was among the preconditions for Blackstone to be able to follow through on what would have been its biggest China real estate deal ever with some analysts tying the fund manager’s failure to win regulatory approval for the deal to rising US-China tensions.

“The market can only see SAMR’s inaction as an indication of worsening economic relations with the US and China each appearing increasingly wary of investment by the other” said Brock Silvers chief investment officer at Hong Kong-based Kaiyuan Capital. He added that “Blackstone boss Stephen Schwarzman has been among the biggest investors in China and set up the Schwarzman Scholars programme at Tsinghua University so potential inbound investors may see little hope for their own deals.”

Anti-Monopoly Hurdles

Blackstone had offered HK$5.00 ($0.64) per share for the outstanding equity in Soho China in a deal that was announced on 16 June with entities controlled by Soho chief executive Zhang Xin having committed at the time to selling a 54.93 percent stake to Blackstone funds.

However Friday’s noticed stated that “As at the date of this announcement none of the Pre-Conditions to the making of the Offer has been satisfied.” Without pointing to any specific preconditions the notice added that “The Parties have concluded that the Pre-Conditions are unable to be satisfied on or before the Long Stop Date.”

The original announcement included as the first precondition to the transaction “the submission of a Notification of Concentration of Undertakings by the Offeror to and acceptance by SAMR under PRC Anti-Monopoly Law in respect of the Offer and the clearance or deemed clearance (through the expiration of the relevant statutory time periods for review by SAMR) by SAMR under PRC Anti-Monopoly Law of the Offer (provided that any conditions attached to the clearance imposed by SAMR are reasonably acceptable to the Offeror).”

A joint update by the two companies on 6 July noted that Blackstone had already submitted the required documents to the SAMR but warned that completion of the deal could face delays. Then on 6 August a follow-up announcement said Blackstone had provided additional materials in response to requests by the regulator with SAMR having confirmed on 2 August that all necessary documents for review under China’s anti-monopoly law had been received.

On 6 September however a joint announcement to the Hong Kong exchange indicated that SAMR had told Blackstone that its review of the transaction was still in progress. The announcement added that Blackstone “has received further requests to provide additional information for the regulators’ review” while noting that there was no clear time frame for completing the process.

Successful completion of the buyout would have given Blackstone control of Soho China’s 826406 square metre (8.9 million square foot) portfolio of commercial properties in Shanghai and Beijing.

Led by trophy projects such as the Zaha Hadid-designed Wangjing Soho in Beijing and Bund Soho on Shanghai’s storied riverfront the collection includes five buildings in China’s capital that were between 60 and 68 percent occupied as of 31 December with the four in Shanghai from 82 to 97 percent full at the same interval.

Second Time Unlucky

Friday’s announcement marks the second time that Blackstone has been frustrated in its efforts to take over Soho China after the developer had announced in March last year that it was in talks regarding a potential buyout with Blackstone having been reported as its suitor at the time.

Soho China called those discussions dead in August 2020 after the COVID-19 pandemic had emptied offices and dented the valuation of office properties across Asia. Media reports in late 2019 indicated that Soho China had put its portfolio on the market as a package after years of selling off individual projects.

For Blackstone the DOA deal is a rare China setback after the fund manager has completed acquisitions across the industrial commercial and residential sectors over recent decades and once counted mainland sovereign fund China Investment Corporation (CIC) among its largest investors.

Last November Blackstone agreed to buy a logistics park in Guangzhou from developer Guangzhou R&F for $1.1 billion as its largest-ever purchase of a single China warehouse property.

Also during 2020 the New York-based investment manager spent $150 million to acquire a tranche of Series A perpetual preferred shares of NASDAQ-listed mainland data centre operator 21Vianet. In 2019 Blackstone had acquired a $480 million stake in the Asian division of US mall developer Taubman Centers.

Blackstone chairman Stephen Schwarzman in 2016 led the establishment of the Schwarzman Scholars programme at Beijing’s Tshinghua University including personally donating $100 million of the $200 million in funding raised to establish the study initiative modelled after Oxford University’s Rhodes Scholar programme."

The task of an anti-ballistic missile system has been described as hitting a bullet with a bullet. In some ways it's an apt analogy because the GMD system destroys its target by smashing an Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle (EKV) into an incoming ballistic missile at a combined hypersonic speed so fast that no explosives are needed to finish the job.

However the job of the GMD is more complex than that. Using a network of ground-based radar early warning radar and land- and sea-based X-band radars the system has to detect track and calculate the optimum trajectory for intercepting the hostile missile in space with the greatest chance of success and then guide the interceptor to its target.

This is made even more difficult because an enemy is hardly likely to cooperate by launching an attack in a nice predictable fashion. As a result the GMD has to have a large degree of flexibility built in with one missile being able to handle a wide variety of targets.

An interceptor lifting off Boeing

Currently the United States has 44 interceptor missiles based at Fort Greely Alaska and Vandenberg Space Force Base California with another 64 on order. These aren't designed to handle something like a massive Russian nuclear attack though they could introduce a serious element of doubt in the attacker's mind. Instead their primary mission is to protect the US from accidental launches or attacks by rogue states like North Korea.

The GMD system is rated to have a 56 percent chance of taking out a missile with a single shot and a 97 percent chance of success with a salvo of four interceptors. Because the interceptors are a standard three-stage design Boeing has been working with the US Defense Department to make the missiles more flexible so that they can intercept an incoming threat earlier in the launch timeline.

Using digital system modeling software upgrades interceptor operators can now choose in real-time a conventional three-stage launch or program the missile to act like a two-stage booster. This isn't simply a matter of not firing the third stage but also of altering the flight profile and determining when to release the kill vehicle.

When mature the new capability will be included in the interceptors as part of the MDA’s Service Life Extension Program.

""The GMD system is reliable and ready if called upon to defend the nation"" says Debbie Barnett Boeing GMD vice president and program director. “For more than 20 years Boeing has led the development integration and maintenance of this system. We’re proud to continue these efforts for the fielded GMD system to ensure the continued defense of the United States for years to come.""

Boeing’s mysterious 747-8 order

Production of the passenger version of the Boeing 747-8 has already ended. While the plane was supposed to be the evolution of previous generations of the 747 airlines are largely opting for lower capacity planes. As far as passenger airlines go Boeing 747-8s are only being operated by Air China Korean Air and Lufthansa. Cargo airlines still have some of these planes on order but that’s it.

Korean Air’s 747-8 first class cabin

In early 2021 it was revealed in Boeing’s orders and deliveries update that a Boeing 747-8 had been ordered by an unidentified customer and it was intended for VIP operations. The particular plane that was speculated to have been ordered had quite a history:

Lufthansa had initially ordered 20 Boeing 747-8s but only ended up with a fleet of 19 of these planes

That’s because Boeing had asked Lufthansa if one of the 747-8s on order could be used as a test aircraft; so Lufthansa reduced its order by one aircraft but had the option of ordering an additional one which it never exercised

That test aircraft is now around 10 years old and it has been in storage for years (most recently in Victorville California); it has the line number 1435 and carried the registration code N828BA

So when there was news of an extra 747-8 order it seemed highly likely that it was this particular 747-8 being ordered… but who would order a single VIP Boeing 747-8?

Boeing 747-8 headed to Egypt

The Boeing 747-8 in storage was recently re-registered as SU-EGY which gives us a clue of what the plan is for this aircraft.

At this point it’s reported that the Boeing 747-8 is headed to the Egyptian government presumably to be the new “Air Force One” of Egypt. Egypt’s existing flagship government aircraft is an Airbus A340-200 with the registration code SU-GGG which is around 27 years old.

As you can see the 747-8 currently has the partial Lufthansa livery so I’m curious to see if it gets the same livery that Egypt’s A340-200 currently has. That sure would look cool on a 747-8.

A 747-8 as a government plane is mighty swanky. The United States government will soon get two 747-8s which will be used as Air Force One. On top of that we’ve seen Qatar gift a 747-8 to Turkish leader Erdoğan after trying (unsuccessfully) to sell the plane.

Qatar gifted Turkey a 747-8 (as one does)

Bottom line

In early 2021 it was revealed that a Boeing 747-8 was purchased by a mystery buyer and it now seems that we know who the buyer is. One of the Boeing 747-8 test aircraft that has been in storage for years has been re-registered as SU-EGY and it’s allegedly going to be used as a government aircraft for Egypt. I’ll be keeping an eye on how this 747-8 delivery evolves…

What do you make of the Egyptian government picking up a 747-8?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vYWlybGluZWdlZWtzLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA5LzEyL2FpcmJ1cy1wb3N0cy1hLXNvbGlkLW1vbnRoLW9mLW9yZGVycy1hcy1ib2Vpbmctc3RydWdnbGVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Airbus Posts a Solid Month of Orders As Boeing Struggles,"[ Aircraft Orders and Deliveries ] By Hemal Gosai

The global decrease in air travel in 2020 created a glut of aircraft many of which were sent to storage to ride out the pandemic with the hope that demand returns. This meant that aircraft manufacturers which had enjoyed orders hand over fist in the years preceding 2020 were in a precarious situation as airlines were putting a pause on their expansion plans.

This year so far has fared somewhat better than last year. Airlines are slowly bringing back capacity where they can especially domestically. There is overall a greater amount of confidence that things will go back to normal soon as the world gets vaccinated and new promising treatments for Covid-19 are made available.

Orders are picking up for the industry as the world tries to move past the Covid-19 pandemic. Boeing managed 257 net orders in July and August orders should be released this coming week. Airbus had 33 net orders in July and approximately 100 net orders in August. While a far cry from the orders piling in pre-Covid-19 it still is a sign of greater confidence moving forward.

This has given aircraft manufacturer Airbus hope. The company has been able to go from just focusing on maintaining aircraft deliveries as much as possible through the pandemic to actually making sales and bringing new orders in today. While the manufacturer still trails Boeing which is rapidly clearing its backlog of Boeing 737 MAX orders the European company still has several bright spots. August was a particularly good month for Airbus in terms of orders one of which was a significant blow to Boeing.

Wizz Air

Wizz Air a budget airline based in Budapest is weighing a purchase of at least 100 Airbus A320 family jets to fuel its expansion plans beyond Eastern Europe. The airline primarily operates a fleet of A320s and Airbus A321s with 202 Airbus A321neos already on order to expand across Europe.

It is dead set on growing in Europe one way or another as it was recently made public that Wizz had put in a bid to take over EasyJet another European budget carrier. The bid was ultimately rejected with EasyJet choosing to raise money instead.

SkyTeam Alliance

Delta Air Lines a SkyTeam alliance airline has also been less kind to Boeing this past month converting purchase rights into firm orders for 30 A321neos. This follows a similar conversion back in April for firm orders of A321neos. Delta is showing strong support for the aircraft with purchase rights for 70 additional aircraft as it seeks to modernize its fleet with newer fuel-efficient aircraft and an improved passenger experience. The airline will begin taking deliveries of the A321neos beginning in the first half of 2022 with deliveries continuing through 2027.

A few other SkyTeam airlines are also likely to show Airbus some love in the coming months. Italia Trasporto Aereo the successor of bankrupt Italian airline Alitalia may also go to Airbus for new aircraft.

Air France-KLM is also looking to sign a deal for aircraft and both Boeing and Airbus are in competition for the order. However it is likely the order will go to the French aircraft manufacturer Airbus given the recent French government support that was given to the airline.

Jet2

European airline Jet2 has also placed an order with Airbus for 36 A321neo aircraft and options to purchase another 24 aircraft in a huge blow to Boeing. Jet2 currently operates a fleet comprised of mainly Boeing 737 aircraft.

It is likely that the new aircraft on order from Airbus are going to replace aging Boeing aircraft in the fleet leaving Boeing in a very difficult spot since now it would make sense for Jet2 to continue with Airbus aircraft in the future. There is also reasoning that could support Jet2 splitting its fleet between Boeing and Airbus so Boeing may not be out of the running in the long term.

Author Hemal Gosai Hemal took his first flight at four years old and has been an avgeek since then. When he isn't working as an analyst he's frequently found outside watching planes fly overhead or flying in them. His favorite plane is the 747-8i which Lufthansa thankfully flies to EWR allowing for some great spotting.

That’s the conclusion of a trio of scientists from the University of Utah who are among the winners of this year’s Ig Nobel prizes the Nobel Prize spoofs that honor — or maybe dishonor depending on your point of view — strange scientific discoveries.

The winners of the 31st annual Ig Nobels being announced Thursday included researchers who figured out how to better control cockroaches on U.S. Navy submarines; animal scientists who looked at whether it’s safer to transport an airborne rhinoceros upside-down; and a team that figured out just how disgusting that discarded gum stuck to your shoe is.

For the second year in a row the ceremony was a roughly 90-minute prerecorded digital event because of the worldwide coronavirus pandemic said Marc Abrahams editor of the Annals of Improbable Research magazine the event’s primary sponsor.

While disappointing in many ways because half the fun of a live ceremony is the rowdy audience participation the ceremony retained many in-person traditions. Those included real Nobel laureates announcing the prizes and the world premiere of a mini opera called “A Bridge Between People” about children who literally build tiny suspension bridges to join two angry adults.

No faces were punched for the beard study published in the scientific journal Integrative Organismal Biology.

Instead University of Utah scientists Ethan Beseris Steven Naleway and used a fiber epoxy composite to simulate human bone and sheepskin to act as the human skin — sometimes with the fleece still on sometimes sheared. They then dropped weights on them.

The sample with the fleece still attached absorbed more energy than the sheared samples.

“If the same is true for human facial hair then having a full beard may help protect vulnerable regions of the facial skeleton from damaging strikes such as the jaw” they said. “Presumably full beards also reduce injury laceration and contusion to the skin and muscle of the face.”

It’s obvious that those wads of discarded chewing gum found on sidewalks around the world are pretty revolting.

But just how revolting?

Researchers from a Spanish university determined the already-chewed gum that has been stuck to the sidewalk for three months is teeming with nasty bacteria.

It sounds like a silly study but as usual there was some method to the madness.

“Our findings have implications for a wide range of disciplines including forensics contagious disease control or bioremediation of wasted chewing gum residues” Leila Satari Alba Guillén Àngela Vidal-Verdú and Manuel Porcar from the University of Valencia wrote in their paper which was published at Nature.com.

A team of U.S. Navy researchers won for figuring out a cheaper and more effective way to control cockroaches on submarines. The 1971 study that appeared in Journal of Economic Entomology found that traditional methods such as carboxide fumigation and use of the pesticide malathion were not good enough.

They found that using the pesticide dichlorvos was less expensive and more effective.

The goal is to return next year’s ceremony to its traditional home at Harvard University’s Sanders Theatre Abrahams said but much depends on whether the pandemic is under control and what kind of travel restrictions are in place around the world.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXRpbWVzLmNvLnVrL2FydGljbGUvaW50ZWwtdGFyZ2V0cy1hcm15LWZpcmluZy1yYW5nZS1pcmVsYW5kLWpvYi1mYWN0b3J5LWJ2dDdjNzI2bdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel targets army firing range for 10000-job factory,"A Defence Forces firing range in Oranmore Co Galway has been selected as a possible location for a “mega-fab” Intel semiconductor plant that could create 10000 jobs.

The 216-hectare rifle range owned by the Department of Defence has been selected by the Industrial Development Agency (IDA) as the preferred site for Intel’s EU microchip foundry. The project would involve building eight factory modules which are known as “fabs” in the industry on a single campus.

They all tell us this is code red” President Joe Biden said while visiting neighborhoods in New York and New Jersey hit hard by Hurricane Ida.

“The nation and the world are in peril. That’s not hyperbole. That is a fact” he added.

But is it? While the president is well known for his empathy his climate science is a bit weak. Almost everything he said was factually incorrect.

Biden’s not alone. Media coverage of Hurricane Ida — as with every other major weather event — was full of reports that the latest storm or flood or fire is “proof” that a climate disaster is impending. Not claims average temperatures are rising — a conclusion nearly all climate scientists concede — but that the weather is getting worse and a world-killing climate crisis is right around the corner.

As Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez put it in the wake of Hurricane Ida “The fossil fuel industry and humanity are incompatible … there is no sustainable future where fossil fuels continue to be burned.”

“Not a political opinion” she added. “That’s just science.”

In scientific circles this is called “an unsupported hypothesis.” Average Americans would call it well “fertilizer” is close.

“Contrary to common knowledge the frequency of hurricanes hitting the continental US has not increased over the period 1900-2020” climate expert Bjorn Lomborg told InsideSources. “The frequency of the much more damaging major hurricanes (category 3+) is not increasing either.”

When the president says “These disasters aren’t going to stop. They’re only going to come with more frequency and ferocity” it’s certainly frightening. It’s just not factual.

Many media reports have focused on the financial costs of hurricanes storms and floods arguing they’re doing more dollars of damage today than in the past. This is also untrue based on the numbers.

Despite the fact that far more people are wealthy enough to live along the world’s coastlines in beachfront homes and condos than a century ago the comparative costs of weather events have declined.

“Today hurricanes around the world cause damage worth 0.04% of global gross domestic product” Lomborg notes. “And the destruction dealt by these storms is projected by a study in Nature to drop to 0.02% of global GDP in 2100 as the world economy gets richer making infrastructure more resilient.”

And the news regarding the human toll of weather events in this “code red” moment is even better.

“Over the past hundred years annual climate-related deaths have declined by more than 96%. In the 1920s the death count from climate-related disasters was 485000 on average every year. In the last full decade 2010-2019 the average was 18362 dead per year or 96.2% lower” Lomborg wrote.

Biden is also wrong on the more complicated question of the overall climate. His “code red” comment is a reference to the U.N.’s new Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report considered by many to be the definitive analysis of climate data. But the phrase “code red for humanity” doesn’t appear anywhere in the report. It’s from a press release put out by a U.N. politician not a climate scientist.

Instead the new report actually has good news in its climate projections. It finds the worst-case scenario temperature increase is lower than previous projections and its previous predictions for carbon outputs were too high. The risk of some nightmare scenario of a world aflame is actually lower than the IPCC panelists once thought.

Once again this isn’t from a petroleum-industry think tank. This is the same U.N. report advocates for expensive Green New Deal policies point to when pressing for say “net zero emissions economy-wide by no later than 2050” or a 50% reduction in carbon output by 2030.

Those goals aren’t considered realistic by most energy industry experts. Not because of politics but because of physics. According to the Energy Information Administration solar wind hydro and thermal power generate about 20% of America’s electricity combined.

Not to mention the billions of gallons of gas and diesel burned by vehicles on America’s highways each year. Could electric vehicles cut that in half by 2030?

Not likely given that EVs account for just 2% of the cars on America’s roads. Even Biden’s $7.5 billion proposal to build charging stations is unlikely to get America to 50% EV use.

That’s the bad news — for Biden anyway.

For the rest of us who want the economy to continue to grow while we take reasonable actions to lower carbon emissions the future is blue skies not code red.

The following is a summary of some recent studies on COVID-19. They include research that warrants further study to corroborate the findings and that have yet to be certified by peer review.

Arthritis drug cuts death risk in high-risk patients

Hospitalized COVID-19 patients at high risk for becoming critically ill and dying had significantly better outcomes if they received the anti-inflammatory drug anakinra researchers have found.

To test the drug sold as Kineret by Sweden's Sobi Inc the researchers looked for patients with high blood levels of a protein called suPAR which is linked to higher odds of needing mechanical breathing assistance and death from COVID-19.

The 594-patient trial tested anakinra which blocks the effects of inflammatory proteins IL-1-alpha and IL-1-beta against a placebo.

The risk of death was 55% lower in patients who received anakinra and 80% lower for the sickest patients in the trial the researchers reported in Nature Medicine.

""The clinical benefit with anakinra treatment was already apparent from day 14 and this is of clinical importance because the first 14 days is the period during which a patient is expected to worsen. Anakinra benefit was maintained until day 28"" they said.

They note that measuring suPAR allows for a more personalized treatment approach but its use to guide COVID-19 treatment could be problematic because the tests are not available in every hospital.

Heart drugs might help prevent COVID-19 blood clots

Drugs that prevent blood clots after procedures to unclog heart arteries might also be useful for clot prevention in patients with COVID-19 new data suggests.

The coronavirus is known to affect genes that control platelets fragments in the blood that form clots.

The inflammatory proteins generated by the virus cause platelets to become ""hyperreactive"" and form clots more easily and more often.

In test tube experiments described on Wednesday in Science Advances researchers found that anticoagulants used after coronary stenting - clopidogrel sold as Plavix by Bristol Myers Squibb and Sanofi and ticagrelor sold as Brilinta by AstraZeneca - keep COVID-19 patients' platelets from becoming over-activated by blocking the P2Y12 protein on their surface.

If additional studies confirm their findings these P2Y12 inhibitors ""may represent a particularly attractive therapy"" for reducing the risk of inflammation-related blood clots in COVID-19 the authors say. -- Reuters",,,,,,,,,,,,

We have Joe Brown Park in New Orleans East and Gernon Brown Recreation Center in City Park. I know Brown is a common name but is there any connection? What can you tell me about both?

Dear reader

The two men are not related but each left an indelible mark on New Orleans.

The recreation center near City Park is named for G. Gernon Brown the legendary Jesuit High School coach and teacher who also was one of the founders of the New Orleans Recreation Department.

From the 1930s through the 1950s Brown’s Jesuit teams won 42 major championships including 16 state championships in three sports — football baseball and basketball. He was inducted into the Greater New Orleans Sports Hall of Fame and Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame.

“Brown was a coach in the tradition of Knute Rockne or Frank Leahy. His greatest attribute was the ability to make boys perform beyond their normal capabilities” wrote Times-Picayune sports columnist Buddy Diliberto in a January 1963 column marking Brown’s death.

Brown was a charter member and organizer of New Orleans Junior Sports Association forerunner of the New Orleans Recreation Department. He was appointed coordinator of NORD programs in 1953 and a year later was named executive assistant director. The recreation center bearing his name at Harrison Avenue and Marconi Drive was dedicated in 1967.

Joe Brown Park in New Orleans East is named for Joe W. Brown a Texas native who moved to New Orleans with his wife Dorothy in 1925. When he died in 1959 The Times-Picayune called him the state’s largest independent oil producer.

In 1958 the Browns established the Joe W. and Dorothy Dorsett Brown Foundation which donated 163 acres of land to establish Joe W. Brown Memorial Park in 1962. The foundation also donated $250000 to build the park’s Joe W. Brown Recreation Center dedicated in 1976.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vY29tbWFuZGVyc3dpcmUudXNhdG9kYXkuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMTEvY29tbWFuZGVycy1keWFtaS1icm93bi1taWtlLXNhaW5yaXN0aWwv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Commanders WR Dyami Brown to share No. 2 with Sainristil,"Dyami Brown has not been cut by the Commanders.

The Commanders in announcing their rookie jersey numbers certainly seized the attention of many when they revealed defensive back Mike Sainristil would be wearing No. 2 this offseason.

Washington Commanders DB Mike Sainristil (@MikeSainristil) is wearing number 2. Currently shared with Dyami Brown. #RaiseHail pic.twitter.com/3ntvZ3NfJW — NFL Jersey Numbers (@nfl_jersey_num) May 10 2024

Commanders fans certainly recognize that receiver Dyami Brown has worn No. 2 for each of his three NFL seasons here in Washington (2021-23).

It is true the Commanders are completing their 90-man roster in preparation for their off-season mini-camps OTAs and training camp. So while the roster is full at the 90-player capacity yes there will be some sharing of jersey numbers.

Yet it is also true that the former Michigan defensive leader Sainristil was a second-round choice (50) of this current administration led by general manager Adam Peters.

Consequently it would not be a stretch to conclude that if both Brown and Sainristil make the final 53-man roster Sainristil will wear the No. 2 jersey.

Even more Brown though he wore No. 2 at North Carolina simply has not produced in his three NFL seasons. Ron Rivera drafted Brown in the third round (82) in 2021. He has played in 15 15 and 17 games yet accomplished only a mere 12 5 and 12 receptions.

Most likely Brown will not survive unless he has an impressive preseason. He simply cannot afford to have the unimpressive preseason games he has experienced thus far.

When former Washington Redskins running back Brian Mitchell (1990-99) was asked about this by JP Finlay during their 106.7 The Fan show Friday Mitchell succinctly responded “They never gave anybody my number when I was on (the team) from year one all the way through…I never really worried about my number. I worried about being ready to play.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd2VhdGhlci5jb20vc2NpZW5jZS9uYXR1cmUvdmlkZW8vYnJvd24tYmVhci1jaGFyZ2VzLWF0LWNhci1pbi1qYXBhbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Brown Bear Charges At Car In Japan - Videos from The Weather Channel,"Type at least three characters to start auto complete.

Bobbi Brown shared exactly how to use each shade of her iconic .

“I’m in my mid-60s I don’t know what I would do without this product” she said.

The versatile formula can be used as a skin tint blush and highlighter.

Bobbi Brown’s have disrupted the makeup scene over the last few years. Since their launch Brown has expanded the shade range from four to 12 colors allowing each to serve a specific purpose for different skin tones. In a new video the makeup artist explained exactly how to use Miracle Balm and offered tips for application for every shade.

In general the Miracle Balms are an enhancement a problem solver and a lifter Brown said. “If you’re someone who is of a certain age and you feel like you’ve been not looking your best you’ve been looking tired when you put this on it automatically makes you look better. And usually by the way when you look better you start feeling better.”

Below is Brown’s guide to wearing her hero product—plus how you can layer them to get an angelic natural glow.

Jones Road Miracle Balm skin tints

Tints essentially give the face a healthy wash of color. is “great for women who have fair to medium skin” Brown said. is her personal go-to she added as the deep mauve is ideal for those who have olive-yellow skin tones and want to counteract it. “There’s enough red in it so it just looks like a combination of bronzer tint and blush” she said. “It also looks great on the lips.” she uses all over when she “want[s] to look healthy like I have a tan.” is great for those who have red undertones because it helps “cut the redness” she said. Lastly there’s  which works great on medium to dark skin tones as an all over tint—it can even be used on the lips.

To apply the skin tints Brown suggested using your fingers to blend it into to your cheeks forehead nose and chin.

Jones Road Miracle Balm blushes

If you’d rather not apply the balm all over opt for one of the blush shades. is the “most beautiful pink” that some people also use on their lips Brown explained. “I use it on top of Tawny.” Then there’s  which is more of a peachy coral and the newest blush shade is . “It sits somewhere between Dusty Rose and Flushed” Brown explained. “It’s great for very fair to dark skin tones.”

Jones Road Miracle Balm highlighters

is a cool-toned highlight with silvery hues and is like its “warm sister” Brown said. The latter shade is great for people with dark skin or those who prefer bronze tones she explained. The newest highlighter shade is  a frosty pink. “As a mom of three boys I never got to do the pink thing ... I love sequins I love ballerinas I love tulle. So Happy Hour reminds me of that.” Lastly is colorless for those who don’t like sparkle. Instead it uses its emollient texture to give the high points of the face—cheekbones bridge of the nose forehead cupids bow—a lit-from-within gleam.

Jones Road Miracle Balm application tips

The shades you choose may determine how you apply your balm but Brown cleared the air by saying you can really put it wherever you want. For a natural full-face routine however you can use one from each category—a tint to start a blush on the cheeks and lips and a highlight on cheekbones. If you have oily skin Brown recommended putting your balms of choice over a light veil of loose powder. On the flip side they float effortlessly over and hydrate dry mature skin. “I’m in my mid-60s I don’t know what I would do without this product” she said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tL3ZpZGVvLzIwMjQvMDUvMDkvam9zaC1icm93bi1vbi1hbWF6b24tdGhpcy1pcy10aGUtbmV3LWFwcGxlLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"Josh Brown on Amazon: ""This is the new Apple""","Share Share Article via Facebook Share Article via Twitter Share Article via LinkedIn Share Article via Email

American spirits major Brown-Forman the maker of many popular brands including Jack Daniel’s is seeking to tap a “huge opportunity” in the Indian market where premiumisation of liquor has accelerated during the coronavirus pandemic according to a company official.

The Louisville Kentucky-based company has enhanced efforts towards making its premium global spirits portfolio accessible to drive category penetration for American Whiskeys said a company official.

It is driving retail distribution for its premium and super-premium portfolio and expanding with introductions of the global portfolio in the Indian market.

“As a part of our portfolio development strategy we are looking to expand the Jack Family of Brands in India to strengthen our portfolio in India and serve consumers better by offering them more choices” Brown-Forman director and GM-IMENA Siddharth Wadia told PTI .

Jack Daniel’s is already back to its pre-covid times sales level in the domestic market and continues to drive forward the category penetration portfolio offerings and consumer engagement he added.

When asked about the long-term outlook for the Indian market Mr. Wadia said it remains very positive.

“What gives us confidence is the strong premiumisation trend as consumers continue to upgrade... mixability and cocktails finding more favour with consumers and their desire to discover newer experiences driving experimentation beyond the standard scotch whiskey segment” he said.

“Hence we are very well poised to grow strongly in India with our globally iconic brand Jack Daniel’s and leadership position in American Whiskey.”

India is among the top 10 emerging international markets for Brown-Forman and continues to remain a focus for long-term growth.

“India is the largest whiskey market in the world and contributes half of global whiskey volume. With rising income levels and exposure increasing well-travelled legal drinking-age population and continued premiumisation the potential Indian markets offer is immense” Mr. Wadia added.

The pandemic has indeed given rise to some very interesting trends he said: “Notable among them have been the rise of home consumption and staycations premiumisation digital connectedness and the focus on convenience and safety.”

The company has also observed that consumers were spending more time on digital and social media as they were locked inside their homes. “Therefore we enhanced our outreach on social media to reach out to consumers through the digital channel” he said.

Brown-Forman Corporation is one of the largest American-owned companies in the spirits and wine business.

Besides Jack Daniel’s it has a portfolio of several well known brands which includes Woodford Reserve Old Forester Benriach GlenDronach Glenglassaugh Finlandia Herradura Korbel and Chambord.",,,,,,,,,,,,

He was inducted into the Gaming Hall of Fame in 2019.

Vegas has no NBA team (yet) but can it support 2 arena projects?

Stan Mallin a pioneering Las Vegas hotel and casino developer who was inducted into the Gaming Hall of Fame in 2019 died on Saturday night according to his wife Sandra Mallin. He was 98.

Mallin met his longtime business partner Jay Sarno when the two were roommates at the University of Missouri. He and Sarno built motels in Georgia Texas and California before they visited Las Vegas on a “junket” Sandra Mallin told the Review-Journal on Sunday.

“They were shocked that there were no hotels and upscale stuff” she said. “And they had this vision of creating something.”

The two opened Caesars Palace in 1966 at a cost of $24 million. It sold three years later for $60 million.

“We hit lightning in a bottle with Caesars” Mallin told the Review-Journal in 1999. “It took right off. It was the nicest thing in Las Vegas and maybe in the country.”

Meanwhile Sarno and Mallin were looking for the next new idea — a resort embodying everybody’s childhood fantasy of running away to join the circus. Circus Circus was built in the shape of a tent and trapeze artists performed overhead. A live pink elephant “flew” around the casino on a sort of overhead tram. Sarno himself would dress up as a ringmaster and walk through the casino.

None of it worked well enough to turn a profit. Mallin said in 1999 that the mistake was opening without hotel rooms to provide a captive audience. The theory was that the place would be interesting enough to draw visitors from other casinos. It did but most came to gawk and not gamble.

“About that time there was a gasoline crunch and you could shoot a cannon down the Strip and not hit anybody” Mallin said. “We didn’t weather that. We lost $5 (million) or $6 million so we leased it to Bill Bennett and Bill Pennington.”

Bennett had casino-hotel experience as an executive with Del Webb Corp. and Pennington was his partner in a slot machine business.

“They struggled the first year then conditions turned around and to tell the truth they were probably better operators than we were” Mallin said. “They exercised their option to buy after a few years and Circus just went terrific.”

Sarno was inducted into the Gaming Hall of Fame in 1989 and Mallin joined him 30 years later. In announcing Mallin’s induction the American Gaming Association said the pair started “the trend of themed casinos in Las Vegas” and “introduced the concept of experiential casino properties” with Circus Circus.

Michael Green an associate professor of history at UNLV said he finds the timing of the pair’s induction fitting to their relationship: Sarno was the face of the operation and Mallin was more of a behind-the-scenes guy.

“Very often a visionary needs a detail person around” said Green who did not know Mallin personally. “(Caesars Palace and Circus Circus) appear to have been mostly Sarno’s vision but I have the feeling with all due respect to Sarno that he couldn’t have done it without Mallin.”

Former Las Vegas Mayor Oscar Goodman said he became good friends with the Mallins when he moved to town in 1964 with his wife current Mayor Carolyn Goodman who worked at Caesars Palace. He largely credits Mallin and Sarno with inspiring the architecture and design that make up the Strip today.

“Jay was a gourmand and everything was loud in a good way” Oscar Goodman said Sunday. “And with Stan everything was quiet in a good way and they were just the perfect combination. I think they were very much responsible for Las Vegas being what it is today.”

The pair are also linked with Stan Mallin Drive and Jay Sarno Way which run parallel to each other at Caesars Palace. Green said Mallin’s street is shorter that Sarno’s another apparent allude to their relationship.

“Mallin said something like ‘Yeah my street is shorter. I didn’t need the attention’” Green said laughing. “And it was named long after Sarno was gone it wasn’t as if Sarno was campaigning for a street but I would have been surprised if Stan Mallin was campaigning for a street.”

Mallin born March 25 1923 in Kansas City Missouri. He and Sarno served in the Army in World War II in the South Pacific. They returned to finish college then teamed up as tile contractors in booming Miami.

“If the season was good you got paid and if it wasn’t you didn’t” Mallin said in 1999.

In a 2014 oral history by UNLV Digital Collections Mallin said the Strip “has changed a great deal” since he his heyday.

“It’s not as personalized as it used to be” he said. “If you were a player in the hotels they knew you. The food was very well done but inexpensive. Everything was catered to the gambling. It’s not that way anymore. The rates are high and the food is high. It’s more impersonal I think.”

An avid golfer Stan met Sandra while on the course. They were married for 39 years. They later founded the Sandra and Stanley Mallin Early Childhood Center at Temple Beth Sholom in 2000.

“He was just a gentleman. An unassuming quiet man. One of the gaming pioneers” Sandra Mallin said. “Lowkey always low-key but very generous.”

Goodman described his friend as one of the few truly decent nice people he can think of adding that he was always trying to help the Las Vegas community and found himself at the forefront of philanthropic efforts every chance he had.

“He wasn’t looking for the limelight but I think if he had to say what his greatest contribution was too our community was he made it a better place for all of us in which to live” Goodman said. “If more people were like Stan Mallin the world would be a better place.”

A funeral is set for 11 a.m. Tuesday at Temple Beth Sholom 10700 Havenwood Lane.

The investment is evident with top-notch dancers and musicians brilliant video panels lasers artificial smoke and the requisite confetti storm at the end.

But of course Osmond delivers qualities you can’t buy — inherent talent work ethic showmanship instincts … showbiz DNA.

“Donny” is thus already a hit at Harrah’s. The show has a permanency. It feels built to last like the Osmonds’ brand itself. Those characteristics made the star’s announcement from the stage Thursday night that the show would run through 2022 almost an afterthought (the new dates begin Jan. 25-29 running through Nov. 19 2022).

Osmond and Caesars Entertainment used the opening night to remind folks that Osmond solo is the lord of the manor at Harrah’s. Remarkably he’s not performed on his own on the Strip ever.

‘Start Again’

It helps that Osmond has a new album “Start Again” two years in the making coinciding with this Vegas residency. That means he can perform his first hit the 1972 “Puppy Love” in the first 10 minutes and move confidently toward the EDM-influenced “Move” from the new release.

Osmond seemingly tireless at age 63 also performs extensive numbers with his backing dancers including a brief tap dance routine. (Yep Donny Osmond is a good tap-dancer. Who knew?)

The star has an experienced team behind the scenes with Greg Young of Mojave Ghost producing (Young has produced Tony and Drama Desk Award-winning Broadway shows among 2500 concerts and 40 Broadway productions). Raj Kapoor (who has teamed with Shania Twain Maria Carey and Backstreet Boys’ live shows) directs. The dance tandem Nappytabs (Napoleon & Tabitha Dumo) has choreographed the show.

Osmond’s abilities as a song-and-dance man can’t be underestimated. He and the backing dancers totally commit. And Osmond settles down to play some piano too so he has that instrument in his arsenal.

“This type of show doesn’t highlight just the new album or one specific part of my career” Osmond said in a phone chat Friday morning. “That’s why the whole concept of when I started designing this thing was let’s make it all inclusive. Let’s do everything I’ve done. Which was pretty ambitious in a 90-minute show.”

So we see Osmond’s classic videos as a 5-year-old stealing scenes from Andy Williams. Unexpected and unearthed moments abound such as a brush of Osmond singing “Ambitious” with Jeff Beck as Osmond fought through a tough career patch in the mid-’80s.

Osmond also revives his “Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat” period (fans still love video of Donny in the shirtless costume). Of course vintage videos of the Osmonds’ 1970s heyday are brought back with shrieking fans grabbing at the youthful Donny in his Elvis-styled jumpsuit.

The whole package would seem fit for a museum exhibit if not that the star is still performing live after nearly 60 years.

A show rap

Showing off his dexterity Osmond performs what is growing to an iconic moment on the Strip a 10-minute rap covering his entire career. Osmond has impressively put this stretch to memory as one verbal misstep throws off the entire routine. He stars in a measured beat and accelerates to his current position as a solo headliner.

“So in 1962 I made my big debut and showed the whole world what little Donny could do” he raps. Of the “Donny & Marie” show he recites “Four nonstop years we had boy what a blast with all those sketches songs and dances it sure went fast. And while those memories were short to last and last you can rest assured those costumes can stay in the past.”

Osmond’s network TV triumphs on “Dancing With The Stars” and “The Masked Singer” are also given a good ride (so is his run as host of the “Pyramid” game show and a dizzying spin as a “Love Boat” guest star). Osmond won “DWTS” a dozen years ago but the victory lives in perpetuity with the mirrored disco ball trophy displayed near the theater entrance. So is the Peacock outfit.

Osmond remains giddy over his appearances on both of those shows but did stop short of leading the crowd in a chant of “Peacock! Peacock” as he did during the “Donny & Marie” show at Flamingo. I recall “Masked Singer” creative director Michael Schwandt once telling me Osmond was rare in celeb performers on the show who arrived with new ideas and put thought into every facet of his appearances.

Osmond is capable enough and so well prepared to offer a call-out segment to the audience to select any song from any Osmond album. He is likely to forget lyrics (as he did with “A Million to One” a lost cut from 1973) and the band will be challenged to find the music in their iPads. But it works as the fans play stump-the-star with the dozens of album covers displayed on the video panel.

The Marie effect

Invariably Marie Osmond remains something of a mythic presence in her brother’s Harrah’s show. “Donny & Marie” was a success at Flamingo for 11 years a brand that seemed to have a life of its own (the smiling siblings loomed over the Strip on Flamingo building wraps for more than a decade). But despite that effective pairing the brother and sister have their own lives and careers.

As his way to close the era Donny sings a moving tribute to Marie and the “Donny & Marie” TV show to the Beatles’ “In My Life.”

Donny’s wife Debbie actually suggested using that number. The videos of the slapstick-tinged variety show are clearly from a bygone era. There seemed no shortage of sequins in the 1970s. And in one moment Marie dumps an entire pitcher of milk over Donny’s head leading to unbridled guffaws.

And we will see Marie drop in on the Harrah’s show at some point and join Donny again onstage.

“Do you think is there is any other option?” Osmond said laughing. “In fact I know exactly what I’m going to say at the beginning of the show. Everybody will know she’s in the room. Right at the top of the show after she receives applause-applause-applause I’m going to say something like ‘We all know who’s in the audience …’ Marie and I have made a promise that we won’t surprise each other. So it’ll be ‘I am announcing to you right now you will be on this stage tonight.’”

But the “Donny” experience will be just that the Donny Osmond show. It’s a little bit nostalgia a little bit new music — with one headliner at the helm.

“I didn’t try to do another Donny and Marie show” Osmond said. “This is something completely different. I just want to supplement what I had in the past. I don’t want to recreate it.”

The animated film “Encanto” will be released on the big screen on November 24 and will not appear on Disney’s on-demand video platform until December 24 the company said in a statement.

Other planned projects including “The Last Duel” by Ridley Scott “Eternals” by Marvel Studios and “West Side Story” by Steven Spielberg will be screened in theaters for at least 45 days before they are released elsewhere.

The decision was eagerly awaited by traditional cinemas after the entertainment giant recently chose to release a series of big productions such as “Black Widow” “Jungle Cruise” and “Cruella” on its Disney+ platform diverting part of their revenue.

“Black Widow” actor Scarlett Johansson has sued Disney accusing the company of breach of contract and costing her millions of dollars in box office revenue after it released the film on its video platform.

Two years ago Disney was producing content for both theaters and television channels but it now has direct access to its audience via streaming a trend accelerated by the pandemic.

In mid-August Disney boss Bob Chapek said he favored “flexibility” and the ability to “follow the consumer wherever he goes”.

During a presentation of the company’s financial results he said “when theaters reopened there was immense reluctance from the public to return”.

Warner Bros. studios has also been heavily criticised for its decision to release all of its new movies for the rest of the year on its HBO Max platform.

I wasn't particularly excited about being nickel-and-dimed throughout the end-to-end travel experience from bags to seats to snacks and more. Plus I didn't want to forgo the miles or elite perks that I'd enjoy on one of my preferred network airlines.

Yet over the past year my thinking has changed. I'm no longer avoiding budget airlines; in fact I've flown multiple domestic flights with Spirit and Frontier and even traveled on Wizz Air in Europe — and I'd happily do it again.

It starts with timing

Throughout the pandemic every U.S. airline has cut routes and slashed frequencies to better match supply with the reduced demand. Though budget carriers aren't immune to the pandemic they've already restored much of their domestic network — and are even growing steadily.

In October Frontier and Spirit will fly 5% and 1% more domestic flights than they did two years prior respectively well before the pandemic even started. As for the Big 3 network airlines — American Delta and United — they're down an average of nearly 15% flights in October 2021 compared to two years prior according to Cirium schedules.

Now more than ever I'm finding better-timed flights with the budget airlines than I am with the legacies. Case in point: I recently flew from Fort Lauderdale (FLL) to New York on a Wednesday night. I was visiting my parents in South Florida and wanted to spend the entire day with them.

The last United flight of the day left at 4:55 p.m. American at 6:30 p.m. and Delta at 7:57 p.m. All of those options meant that I'd need to skip dinner to head to the airport.

Fortunately Spirit had the last flight of the night a 9:22 p.m. departure to Newark (EWR). I could relax with my family during the day and leave for the airport after an early dinner.

In the past I might've filtered out this flight and skipped some family time but the pandemic has made me rethink my priorities — and nowadays I'm booking on schedule more than anything else.

Easier than ever to be a free agent

Of course flying with Spirit meant that I missed out on earning some United American or Delta miles and I wouldn't get credit towards requalifying for Premier 1K or Executive Platinum status.

But because of the pandemic that didn't matter much. For one I wasn't forgoing that many miles. (A $79 United fare would've netted me 660 MileagePlus miles as a 1K member worth about $9 according to TPG valuations.)

Perhaps more importantly it's now much easier than ever to requalify for status thanks to all the limited-time promotions and reduced thresholds. I no longer feel locked on the ""elite-status hamster wheel"" because the airlines have made it dramatically easier to keep my status.

As a free agent I now feel empowered to book away from my preferred airline if the timing works better.

You get what you pay for

One of my favorite elite benefits is free upgrades. Buy a coach ticket and have a chance at scoring an upgrade to first class.

With Spirit Airlines you can outright purchase the equivalent of a domestic first-class recliner for a fraction of the price. On my recent Spirit flight the Big Front Seat was going for $46 a modest upcharge for a much more comfortable experience.

Spirit's Big Front Seat offers both extra legroom and a surprising amount of comfort (Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

With a 2-2 arrangement 36 inches of pitch and 18.5 inches of width Spirit's Big Front Seat is like locking in the first-class upgrade at the time of booking — for the price of a coach ticket.

While it would've been tight in the back purchasing an upgraded seat made for a much more comfortable and enjoyable experience. On other budget airlines I usually purchase an exit row seat for the added legroom.

The pandemic has leveled the playing field

Though there's still a notable difference between flying with Spirit or Frontier and say Delta it's not nearly as stark as it would've been before the pandemic.

It's a no-frills experience flying with a budget airline. You won't be served any snacks or drinks in the air nor is there an airport lounge to enjoy before boarding.

Flying Spirit's Big Front Seat (Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

Nowadays flying with one of the major network airlines is a limited-frills experience. While inflight service has been resuming it's still a far cry from pre-pandemic levels especially on American and Southwest which continue to ban alcohol sales in the coach cabin.

True most domestic airline lounges have reopened but they've pared back their offerings — in some cases you could find a more relaxing environment outside of the lounge than inside of it.

Reliability has improved… generally

One of the biggest reasons why I've long avoided ultra-low-cost carriers is their reliability. If a flight is canceled or significantly delayed the next flight might not be for a few days and you couldn't be reaccomodated on another airline.

While that still holds Spirit and Frontier have made great strides in improving their operation. For one they've both invested in a new fleet of Airbus aircraft.

According to Department of Transportation data Spirit Airlines canceled the fewest number of flights between April 2020 and March 2021 compared to the ten largest U.S. airlines — just 1.57% of its more than 116000 flights did not take off. Excluding canceled flights both Spirit and Frontier operated nearly 90% of their scheduled flights on time during the same period.

Of course Spirit just suffered from a massive operational failure that left thousands stranded for over a week. It took the airline nearly two weeks to get back on its feet. I certainly would've regretted choosing Spirit if I was scheduled to fly during this meltdown and hope it doesn't happen again soon.

Bottom line

I used to avoid flying ultra-low-cost carriers. If I chose Spirit or Frontier I almost always regretted it.

But nowadays I've done more budget airline flying than ever before thanks to convenient schedules improved reliability and the option to purchase a comfortable seat.

All things equal I still unequivocally prefer a major network airline but I'm no longer filtering out the budget carriers like I was doing before the pandemic.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vdW10ZXJwcy5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxLzkvMTEvZm9vdGJhbGwtbWFyeWxhbmQtdGhyb3R0bGVzLWhvd2FyZC14LXjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Maryland Throttles Howard 62-0 - University of Maryland Athletics,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='umterps.com', port=443): Read timed out.

Bettors in 11 states now have convenient access to online sports betting with multiple sportsbooks (Arizona Colorado Indiana Iowa Michigan New Jersey Pennsylvania Tennessee Virginia West Virginia and Wyoming). Five of those states have launched online betting in the last 12 months.

Three additional states offer online betting but only with one sportsbook (New Hampshire Oregon and Rhode Island). Online betting is also legal in Illinois and Nevada but with the totally unnecessary inconvenience that bettors must first register in person at a participating casino. Iowa previously had the same requirement but allowed it to expire in January 2021. Combined that amounts to 14 states with easy access to sports betting plus two where it's a little inconvenient.

Some states such as Connecticut and Louisiana are working to open online sports betting by the end of the year.

Regulations and available sportsbooks vary by state—for example in Virginia bettors can't gamble on any game involving an in-state college but Arizona does allow this. But for the most part sports fans in the above states can bet on whatever games they want including all the major U.S. sports leagues and even things you never even considered like Estonian soccer or Australian football (these are all real options at the BetMGM sportsbook).

For the time being the four most populous states in the country are missing out on the fun. What baby steps California has taken toward legalization would still only allow in-person betting at certain casinos and probably not until 2023. Mobile betting in New York is in the works and should be launched in time for Super Bowl LVI in February 2022. Florida is launching in-person betting at Seminole casinos in October but mobile betting faces an uphill battle of lawsuits. Texas legislators were too busy requiring teams to play the national anthem to make any progress on sports gambling.

For what it's worth online sports gambling in Washington D.C. is legal but only through the D.C. Lottery and its terrible betting lines. Other than that bettors can place online bets with Caesars Sportsbook and BetMGM—but only within two blocks of Capital One Arena or Nationals Park respectively.

Sports betting of all sorts was largely illegal across the country until May 2018 when the Supreme Court struck down the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992. Before that law only a few states had legal sports betting (and were grandfathered in) and it was basically impossible for the masses to place bets unless you happened to know a sketchy bookie.

Nowhere however did the poverty rate reach the level of the capital of the Choco province where 66% of the 131000 residents found themselves living below the poverty line in 2020.

Only one third of Quibdo’s residents had a monthly income that was higher than $106 (COP407000) according to the Red de Ciudades Como Vamos.

More than 86 thousand people earned less than the municipal poverty line. Of these people almost 40000 found themselves living in extreme poverty and on the brink of starvation.

Quibdo’s income levels

Locals are not just suffering from extreme poverty “but the lack of access to health education decent work and adequate infrastructure in the homes” according to the Red de Ciudades.

The latter became painfully evident on Saturday when a a three-year-old girl died in a fire caused by a shortcut.

Government failures

President Ivan Duque’s efforts to reactivate Colombia’s economy after the worst collapse in recorded history has had little effect especially in the capital of Choco.

Duque traveled to Quibdo in January to present his “Compromise for Colombia” economic reactivation strategy.

According to the president’s special regional advisor Ana Marua Palau Choco was a “priority province for the government” that would receive a $133 million investment “to implement reactivation projects.”

Since then Quibdo’s unemployment rate rose to 21.9% between April and June compared to 20% between November last year and January according to statistics agency DANE.

The Inspector General’s Office warned Mayor Martin Sanchez last month that his government had left some 34000 without school lunches from a month.

The School Food Program couldn’t have been more important as it seeks to curb malnutrition among Colombia’s poorest children.

Starve obediently

Violence by illegal armed groups has made it increasingly difficult for locals to speak out about the deteriorating situation in Quibdo psychologist Haidy Sanchez said in an editorial in newspaper El Tiempo last month.

There have been approximately 83 homicides so far this year endless homicide attempts rampant robberies threatening and intimidating pamphlets with a defiant tone by criminal gangs that give the feeling you can’t express an opinion about the situation regarding government control or the current social decomposition in the city because one could be the target of threats.

Psychologist Haidy Sanchez

Two weeks after Sanchez reported 83 homicides social leader Darwin Lozano said Thursday that the number of murder victims had gone up to 93.

According to Colombia’s human rights office leftist ELN guerrillas right-wing AGC paramilitaries and two local criminal organizations are vying for control over Quibdo.

In her column Sanchez deplored how the people of Quibdo were “abandoned” by authorities.

Lozano added on Thursday that “there is no authority” in the capital of Choco as local police doesn’t seem to be able to provide public security.

According to the Red de Ciudades Como Vamos the local government doesn’t even have a poverty reduction policy."

First post and please forgive me if many of these questions have been answered. Ive searched the forums for answers to my questions as ive been a lurker for years.



A little background...the transmission in my current vehicle is dying so I need to purchase a new vehicle so I decided to make the leap into the electric vehicle world. I found a 2017 75D 1-owner vehicle at carmax with 40000 miles no accidents on the record. Car is clean non-smoker vehicle. Car is a 12/17 build.



1. Anything I should look for? Ive checked the windows checked for leaks door handles all work however the headlights have yellowing around the halo so i will ask to have that repaired.

2. Carmax replaced all tires

3. Currently has EAP but Ive read that it could possibly be removed by Tesla which isnt a big deal to me.

4. The vehicle has the standard 19"" wheels in silver and i would like to change the color to what ive seen on other model S vehicles (pics enclosed). Were these wheels an upgraded option or are they powder coated sonic silver?

5. The car still has a little bit of the warranty left since it's a December build correct? If so what else should i get checked/replaced while still under warranty.



Thank you in advance.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vdG9yYmlzY3VpdC5jb20vc2VsbC1sZWFzZWQtY2FyLWVhcmx5LWF1dG9tYWtlcnMtd29udC1hbGxvdy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Want to Sell Your Leased Car Early? Some Automakers Won't Allow it,"If you're looking to sell your leased car to a third party dealer watch out. You might not be able to if you leased it from these two automakers.

If you’re currently leasing a car and you can’t afford the lease payments or if your lease is up you have the option to sell the car in order to terminate the lease. By selling your car lease to a third party like Carmax or Carvana you can not only get rid of those pesky monthly payments but you could even stand to make a profit until now. As of late some automakers are requiring lessees to return the car to the original dealer they leased it from.

Why would anyone want to sell their leased car?

Don’t get us wrong it’s easy to return your leased car back to the original dealer or another one of the brand’s franchised dealerships. However doing so can cost you a considerable amount of money. U.S. News reports that if your leased car has a low amount of miles or is worth more than its predicted residual value you might not see the potential profits like you would if you sold it to a third-party dealer.

For example I sold my leased 2019 Subaru Forester to Carvana late last year. I was only one year into the lease when I decided that I didn’t need the car anymore so I received the payoff amount from the leasing company and had the car appraised through Carvana. The payoff amount was around $24000 which is the amount that would need to be paid to own the car free and clear. Surprisingly Carvana offered me around $27000 (based on the current market conditions) which meant selling it to them would yield a nearly $3000 profit.

However depending on which brand of car that you’re currently driving you may not be able to do what I did. A few automakers mainly GM and Honda are now restricting their lessees from selling their cars to third-party retailers like Carmax and Carvana.

Why are they restricting lessees from selling their cars?

Carvana offers and all-online approach to car sales | Mark Ralston via Getty Images

There are a few reasons why brands like GM and Honda are currently restricting lessees from selling their cars to other retailers. The first reason is that there are currently fewer cars on dealer lots. Thanks to the global chip shortage dealer lots have been void of their usually stocked new and used car inventories and now the automakers need to make up for the shortage in some way. One easy way for them to do it is to require their lessees to sell or trade their current cars back to their dealers in order to help fill their lots.

The second reason is profit. Instead of lessees getting the profits from selling their leased cars to third parties Honda and GM are now looking to reap some of those profits by re-selling those leased cars instead. The chip shortage has skewed the used car market upward this year and by requiring all leased Honda and GM vehicles to go back to their own dealers the brands can capitalize on the car’s higher values by re-selling them.

The third reason that automakers are restricting lessees from selling their cars to other vendors is to mitigate some of the competition. The pandemic brought an uptick in business to “no-hassle no-haggle” dealers like Vroom Carmax and Carvana. This provided a lot of competition to the traditional car dealerships since consumers (like myself) were selling their cars to these companies and padding their inventories. By getting rid of the ability for consumers to sell to third parties there will be less competition for brands like GM and Honda.

How to get around these lease-end limitations

If you’re currently leasing a Honda or GM vehicle and are nearing the end of your lease then there is a way to circumvent the restrictions. At the end of the lease term you can purchase the car outright and sell it yourself to whomever you want. Just note that this strategy can end up being costly as you’ll need to pay for the car’s taxes and registration fees after you purchase it. You may also need to take out a loan to cover the cost of the car which will accrue interest.

You can also elect to trade the car in for a new model as both Honda and GM might have special deals for current lessees. However different regions will have different deals. Hopefully the market will stabilize soon enough that automakers will lessen these restrictions. But for now don’t take your leased Honda or GM car to a third-party dealer you could be turned away.",,,,,,,,,

In a bid to alleviate some of the difficulties Carnival Cruise Line has announced that it will accept specific home tests for fully vaccinated travelers wanting to sail with the cruise line.

According to Carnival’s website a medically observed self-test (sometimes referred to as home test) used by guests must meet the following criteria:

It must be a COVID-19 viral test (NAAT or antigen test) with Emergency Use Authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA);

The testing procedure must include a telehealth service affiliated with the manufacturer of the test that provides real-time supervision remotely through an audio and video connection. Some FDA-authorized self-tests that include a telehealth service may require a prescription;

The telehealth provider must confirm the person’s identity observe the specimen collection and testing procedures confirm the test result and issue a report that meets the requirements of acceptable proof of a negative COVID-19 test.

Carnival has recommended using an Abbott BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag Card Home Test which includes a viral antigen home test and the services of an eMed telemedicine professional who will supervise the administration of the home test.

The test provider must provide guests with an official test result; no handwritten report. Results are provided in approximately 15 minutes and test kits are available to be shipped in 50 states. The home test (including two tests) costs $69.99 when it is purchased via the Optum Store.

The new changes come as the CDC announced that as of Sept. 13 2021 pre-cruise testing for vaccinated guests must be taken within two days prior to the sailing date as opposed to three. So if the sailing is on Saturday the test may be taken on Thursday Friday or even as late as Saturday as long as the guest is guaranteed to receive their results in time for check-in.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vY2FsZW5kYXIuc3Rvbnlicm9vay5lZHUvZXZlbnQvd29sZmllbGFuZC1jYXJuaXZhbC0yMDIxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wolfieland Carnival 2021,"Search Text

Mardi Gras would have six distinct “zones”: Grand Central The French Quarter La Piazza Summer Landing Lido and The Ultimate Playground.

Each would feature restaurants bars attractions and decor based around a particular theme.

In this article we’re going to focus on Summer Landing found on the aft section of deck 8 and described by Carnival as “the greatest chill spot at sea.”

Along with a slew of comfortable seating overlooking the wake there are several venues located both inside and out including Guy’s Pig & Anchor Smokehouse/Brewhouse the Heroes Tribute Lounge and The Watering Hole.

Heroes Tribute Lounge

First introduced on Carnival Panorama this space is designed to honor both past and present veterans. The space offers comfy couches big-screen televisions a Swirls ice cream station and military memorabilia.

It’s a very nice spot to relax meet up with friends and watch some sports. The lounge features a special Heroes Tribute bar menu and souvenir pint glasses.

The lounge doesn’t have its own bar but it’s just a short walk over to the Pig & Anchor Brewhouse to order from this menu. For every drink purchased with the Heroes Tribute pint glass Carnival donates $1 to Operation Homefront a non-profit that supports military families.

It was cool to see this area utilized by both military personnel and those who appreciate their service during the course of our sailing.

Mardi Gras Dining Guide: Which Restaurants Are Complimentary?

Guy’s Pig & Anchor Smokehouse|Brewhouse

Ever since being introduced on Carnival Horizon this restaurant — part of the line’s ongoing relationship with celebrity chef Guy Fieri — has proven incredibly popular. With bands performing at night and a BBQ-centric menu being served at both lunch and dinner time it’s no wonder Guy’s has been given such prominent placement on Mardi Gras.

Guy’s Pig & Anchor Smokehouse has been expanded and now offers a complete dinner menu which (subject to change) is currently a complimentary dining option aboard this particular ship.

The dinner menu features a variety of barbeque meats one featured entrée each night tasty sides and a few delicious desserts. It’s also the only restaurant onboard where you can order all of the Parched Pig beer varieties.

Ordering is really easy because diners are given a paper menu on which t0 mark off exactly what they want. I tried the Smoked Strip Steak (which I highly recommend) and Pork Belly when I was on board.

I also highly recommend the Mississippi Mud Pie for dessert — it’s just as good as Carnival’s popular Warm Melting Cake except it’s cold instead of hot.

You’ll also find live music here that’s enjoyable but a little loud during dinner and into the night. It’s great if you want to hang out and drink but it’s not conducive to an intimate conversation over dinner.

In my opinion Carnival should consider starting the band later and letting them play past midnight which seemed too early to stop the party.

Guy’s Pig & Anchor Smokehouse lunch is the same as you can find on Carnival’s Dream and Vista-class ships. It’s located on the port side of deck eight and is a crew-served buffet.

You tell them what kind of meats and sides you would like and they will plate it for you. Like on previous ships this is a complimentary lunch option.

A really nice feature of both lunch and dinner is the variety of barbeque sauces you can add to your meats. You will find a new selection of sauces at dinner that adds some variety to your dining experiences at Guy’s Pig & Anchor.

Breakfast at Guy’s Pig & Anchor isn’t anything special. It’s regular breakfast food served buffet style similar to what you will find in the Lido Marketplace. While there are fewer options it’s worth checking out if you want to avoid the crowds at the Lido buffet.

If you want to get a specialty coffee like a latte or a cappuccino in the morning get it from Bar Della Rosa (in the La Piazza zone) before hitting Guy’s for breakfast. There was no specialty coffee service on our sailing service which seems like lost a lost revenue opportunity.

If you like beer you will not want to miss out on the fresh craft beers from the Brewhouse. The draft beers are poured straight from the beer cave where they were brewed just days beforehand. There is also an opportunity to participate in a tour of the onboard brewery which includes a generous volume of sample beer and a souvenir pint glass for about $25 per person.

MENU: Guy’s Pig & Anchor Smokehouse Menu

If you want to cut down on the cost of your drafts you can buy a beer mug or a growler which can be refilled at a discounted rate. And yes you can bring them back on board in the future and keep the savings going.

The Patio Aft Pool

The inside of Summer Landing is great but the outside is where you can really enjoy some fun in the sun while connecting with the ocean. Directly outside the doors is the Patio Pool which is almost like an infinity pool that butts up right to the very back of the ship.

I really liked what they did with this pool which has a large shallow area that’s about one foot deep with lounge chairs designed to sit in the water. If all the lounge chairs are taken it’s also nice to sit right in the water or on the edge with just your feet in — especially if you like warmer water.

This is a great place to hit on the first day or two as many people gravitate toward the Lido pool and don’t even realize this one exists making it far less crowded. As people discover it during the course of the week it slowly becomes more popular.

The hot tubs are nice and big and are off to one side of the ship which means that they’re actually in the shade early in the morning or in the evening depending on the orientation of the ship.

TRIP REPORT: Final Day on Carnival’s Mardi Gras

On each side of the pool is a permanent umbrella fixture and shaded seating. Be very careful when walking by the pool with the ship still being new the wood around the pool can get very slippery.

The Watering Hole

Mardi Gras is jam-packed with new-to-Carnival bars and restaurants including this Summer Landing venue. Located on the starboard side it’s an outdoor bar with a short-but-sweet menu. It’s conveniently located right next to The Patio’s hot tubs and all of the drinks are simply priced at $9.95 (as of September 2021).

If it’s too hot or humid to drink outside and you’re not feeling the pool or hot tubs take your drink inside to the Heroes Tribute Lounge or Guy’s Pig & Anchor both of which offer plenty of seating options.

Some of our favorites were the Watermelon Crush (Tito’s Fresh Watermelon and syrup) Elderflower Spritz (St. Germain Prosecco and club soda) and Sail Away (Absolute Citron Blue Curacao and juice).

Final Thoughts

The Summer Landing zone is an overall win on Mardi Gras. The way the space is designed provides ample access to both sun and shade meaning no matter which you’re looking for you can find it while still remaining connected to the ocean thanks to the amazing views from nearly every inch of the outdoor space.

Before sailing I was skeptical about how the zone concept would actually work on the ship but now that I’ve seen it outside of a press release I’m very impressed.

An aircraft carrier would be of limited value in a conflict with Russia in Eastern or Northern Europe or the Baltic States.

Maybe Germany is planning revenge for Brexit by sinking British merchant ships in the North Atlantic again.

Because otherwise a top German politician’s call for a European Union aircraft carrier doesn’t make much sense.

Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer president of Germany’s Christian Democratic Union and a likely successor to Chancellor Angela Merkel created a stir when she advocated that European nations work together to build a carrier.

“Germany and France are already working together on the project of a European future combat aircraft” she wrote in an essay in the German newspaper Die Welt (English translation here). “The next step could be the start of the symbolic project of building a common European aircraft carrier to express the global role of the European Union as a power ensuring security and peace.”

Merkel seemed to endorse the idea. ""It's right and good that we have such equipment on the European side and I'm happy to work on it.""

Ironically Kramp-Karrenbauer was actually rejecting a call by French President Emmanuel Macron for tighter European integration. “There is no version of a European superstate which can live up to the goal of a Europe made up of sovereign member states and able to take action” she wrote.

But that still leaves room for a common European defense policy including a European Security Council that includes Britain. And a European aircraft carrier.

Significantly even Kramp-Karrenbauer referred to the Euro-carrier as a “symbolic act.” The value of an aircraft carrier is that it is a mobile airfield that can station aircraft near places that might be difficult to reach with land-based aircraft. That’s important to some nations with global interests or pretensions such as the United States Russia China and even Britain and France two European nations that do operate carriers. Britain for example is sending its new aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth as a warning to China to cool its regional ambitions. France’s Charles de Gaulle and the proposed new carrier to replace it signal France’s remaining colonial interests in places such as the Indian Ocean.

But most European nations don’t routinely send warships to foreign stations or have tiny navies or are landlocked and don’t need navies. An aircraft carrier would be of limited value in a conflict with Russia in Eastern or Northern Europe or the Baltic States. It would need sophisticated defenses and a screen of escort ships to survive in the Baltic against Russian naval and air forces as well as coastal defense missiles such as the hypersonic K-300P Bastion. Even the U.S. Navy with all its money and resources worries about the survival of its supercarriers. It’s hard to imagine that Europe would design and fund a more powerful and survivable ship than a $13 billion American Ford-class carrier.

Europe does have interests in the Mediterranean. In 2018 Britain and France joined the United States in launching air and missile strikes against Syrian government installations. But land-based aircraft can operate from Cyprus or Italy. The European Union also wants to stop a massive flow of illegal immigrants sailing across the Mediterranean to Europe. A carrier would be a very expensive coast guard vessel.

Perhaps the real question isn’t what a carrier would bring but what Europe would give up. The German military is barely functional with Typhoon jet fighters that don’t fly ships that can’t sail and an ill-equipped army that is at a fraction of its Cold War strength. Many NATO members are not even spending the 2 percent of GDP that they are supposed to allocate to defense which leaves little money for an expensive carrier carrier-based aircraft and escort ships. The biggest threats that European nations face from Russian missiles to cyberwarfare a carrier would not solve.

And of course there is the question of who would control a European carrier. Where would it be built who would build it and which aircraft would it fly (France builds its own Rafale M carrier planes while Britain opted for the F-35)? Which authority would command it and commit it to hazardous situations?

Unless Continental Europe is planning to invade Britain in a new Operation Sealion a carrier is the wrong choice.

Schofield says that Fly-in Fly-out (FIFO) contract revenue from Australia’s big resources sector from which Alliance derives two thirds of its revenues has held up very well despite Covid-19.

“Any operator who is serving the resources sector in Australia as part of their business has had – at least financially – a relatively good time” he says.

Underlining the airline’s reliance on resources a full page in its results presentation is dedicated to “commodity exposure” based on its contracts with resources firms. On a revenue basis it is most exposed to iron ore with 29% of the pie followed by gold with 19% and copper/gold/uranium with 15%.

By the company’s definition contract work involves 12-month commitments or greater. While most of this is FIFO it also includes work such as inbound tourism which has collapsed amid the pandemic and domestic tourism which is growing in importance.

In any case FIFO helped account for Alliance’s generating an underlying profit before tax of A$51 million ($37.7 million) for its 2021 financial year ended 30 June up 25% from a year earlier. Total revenue grew 3% to A$307 million.

Alliance also bucked the trend in terms of fleet. With many carriers putting aircraft in long-term storage its fleet grew to 48 by 30 June up from 42 a year earlier. Staff numbers have grown to 849 from 532 when the pandemic hit in the early months of 2020.

On the other hand Schofield says the periodic imposition of internal border restrictions in Australia to stop the spread of Covid-19 have been a challenge especially for moving crews around.

“It’s been incredibly challenging operationally but successful financially” he says. “If you take [the resources charter] market it’s been a very different tale to anyone who operates scheduled services or in our case provides wet-lease services.”

The FIFO operation is largely served by Alliance’s fleet of Fokkers comprising 24 100-seat F100s 14 80-seat F70s and five 50-seat F50 turboprops.

“The Fokkers are incredible aircraft and really perfect for what we use them for down here” says Schofield. “If there were more readily available good quality F100s we wouldn’t hesitate to buy more.”

Schofield adds that it will be 7-9 years before the carrier is looking to replace its Fokkers.

Although additional F100s are hard if not impossible to come by the airline has been able to grow its fleet through the acquisition of 32 secondhand E-190s. Alliance started operating E-190s this year and has just five in service and Schofield has high marks for the twin-engined type’s reliability. He stresses that the E-Jets are for growth – not replacement.

He likes the E-190’s 7500h maintenance interval. “It’s really about working them as hard you can until you get to that interval.” For the Fokker fleet Alliance sees about 1000h of annual utilization per aircraft; for the E-190s this is closer to 3000h.

Despite Covid-19 Alliance will grow its E-190 fleet rapidly forecasting that all 32 examples will in service by the fourth quarter of its 2022 financial year which runs from 1 April to 30 June 2022. Of these 18 will be wet leased by Qantas.

For the time being it has no plans to obtain the re-engined E2 family from Embraer. Schofield notes that Alliance’s specialty is to “speculatively buy” used aircraft.

While the airline aims to keep growing contract revenue in absolute terms it wants to continue diversifying its revenue mix. It has already made some progress with this: some years ago contract accounted for over 90% of revenues.

In addition to contract work the airline has four additional revenue streams: wet leases RPT (regular public transport on regional routes) charters and aviation services.

Indeed the focus of the E-190s is wet-lease work for Qantas. The type has been able to open up point-to-point routes such as Canberra-Darwin that hadn’t been operated before – typically Australian air traffic focuses on the big hubs of Brisbane Melbourne and Sydney.

“Qantas were able to go to from launching it as a daily service to in a very short space of time having the demand to make it a double daily” says Schofield. “What we’re really seeing is the [regional jet’s] ability to dive in on those point-to-point [routes] from smaller cities or smaller locations.”

Another point-to-point service enabled by the E-190 was Adelaide-Gold Coast. While this route had been served by low-cost carriers it was not served by the Qantas brand directly.

Wet-lease revenue was hard-hit in FY2021 falling 68% to A$7.8 million. Charter revenue however grew 66% to $43.7 million making it the second biggest contributor.

Schofield says the charter business has remained strong in Australia. In this business segment Alliance has benefited from business from a mix of clients including sporting teams and travel agencies.

“It’s an interesting market at the moment and everyone rightly points out the challenges” says Schofield. “We like our low profile normally but we’re proud of how we’ve been able to get through this Covid-19 era…to be an airline that is performing financially and operationally well and also using that to grow. It’s been a fascinating ride for us.”

Some become living milkshakes for their dads who guzzle caterpillar body fluids to attract the ladies.

Recently scientists reported the first evidence of butterflies sipping from the bodies of caterpillars — dead and alive. They observed adult milkweed butterflies in North Sulawesi Indonesia using tiny claws on their feet to scratch wounds in caterpillars' bodies so they could lap the liquid that oozed out.

Male butterflies seek certain compounds produced by milkweed (flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae) which repel predators and help the butterflies produce pheromones that attract females. Since caterpillars are stuffed with juices from chewed-up plants they make an easy target for butterflies looking to chemically boost their attractiveness to females.

""The caterpillar larvae would contort their bodies rapidly in what appeared to be futile attempts to deter the persistent scratching of adults"" said the researchers who observed the butterfly baby-drinking. They described their observations in a study published Sept. 8 in the journal Ecology .

Butterflies in the Danainae family are known as milkweed butterflies because most of the caterpillars in this group feed on milkweed plants which contain toxic alkaloids that are absorbed by the caterpillars and then processed into useful chemicals that protect them from predators. Another use for these alkaloids is in mating pheromones which are transferred to females in the males' sperm packet ""as a nuptial gift"" the scientists wrote.

Most milkweed butterfly species are found in Asia but four species live in North America one of which is the colorful monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) according to the Digital Atlas of Idaho . Male butterflies in this family are known for a unique behavior called leaf-scratching in which adults supplement the plant sap they absorbed as hungry caterpillars by scraping at milkweed leaves with their tiny claws to release alkaloid-loaded sap for drinking through their long proboscis. Sometimes males gather by the hundreds to scratch and sip on milkweed leaves according to the study.

But on Dec. 9 2019 lead study author Yi-Kai Tea a doctoral candidate in the University of Sydney's School of Life and Environmental Sciences and co-author Jonathan Soong Wei a naturalist in Singapore saw milkweed butterflies in Indonesia's Tangkoko Batuangus Nature Reserve that were scratching at a different sap-loaded source: live milkweed caterpillars.

""Multiple adults were observed scratching many caterpillars along a stretch of coastal vegetation"" that spanned more than 1600 feet (500 meters) the researchers reported. They then saw the butterflies actively drink ""from the wounded and oozing caterpillars"" for hours with the butterflies sometimes gathering in mixed-species groups. So intent were the butterflies on drinking from the caterpillars that not even the touch of a human observer could distract them the study authors wrote. To describe the behavior the scientists coined the term ""kleptopharmacophagy"" which means ""consuming stolen chemicals.""

""The alternative neologisms 'kairopharmacophagy' (feeding on defensive chemicals from wounded caterpillars detected via 'eavesdropping') or 'necropharmacophagy' (feeding on defensive chemicals from dead caterpillars) might also be appropriate"" the researchers reported.

Over three days the scientists counted seven species of milkweed butterflies that scraped and sipped living and dead caterpillars (it is unknown if the dead caterpillars were drunk to death or died of their wounds). One possible explanation for why the butterflies find caterpillars so delicious is because milkweed alkaloids accumulate in the caterpillars' bodies from the leaves that they eat making their internal ""juices"" a more potent alkaloid-rich brew — and thereby more attractive to thirsty males the scientist suggested.

It's likely that the butterflies are drawn to milkweed leaves that are already damaged from caterpillar chewing; those caterpillars would be close by when the adults start scratching. If a butterfly accidentally scrapes a caterpillar the wound would release a heady chemical scent that would attract the butterfly and encourage it to scratch the caterpillar even more according to the study.

Many questions remain about this unusual (and ghastly) behavior such as which specific plant compounds attract the butterflies to the caterpillars and do butterflies in other parts of the world also practice baby-drinking Tea said in a statement .

""These simple observations raise questions about the ecology of these well-known butterflies providing numerous opportunities for future studies"" he said.

The larger ergonomically optimised cab design incorporates more than 30 new features that Caterpillar says “improve connectivity build confidence and adapt to future mining needs with an expandable electronics platform.” The optimised next gen cab is being displayed at MINExpo 2021 and is currently available for the Cat 785 mining truck but is scheduled to expand to the 789 and 793 models in 2022.

Integrated Cat electronics boost data analytics and diagnostic capabilities. The reengineered electronics platform improves maintenance for Cat mining trucks through enhanced remote services offerings – Remote Flash and Remote Troubleshoot. By upgrading software and diagnosing machine alerts remotely at a time convenient for the production schedule Remote Flash and Remote Troubleshoot deliver higher productivity with maximised truck uptime.

Making the operator more comfortable and efficient is at the heart of the next gen cab. The walk-through design with fully adjustable center console increased legroom adjustable next gen seat temperature-controlled HVAC system and advanced cab filtration option delivers a safer and more comfortable operator environment. Two 254 mm (10 in) ideally located displays eliminate clutter and reduce operator fatigue. The touch screen display integrates several standard and optional Caterpillar technologies with a simple consistent and intuitive streamlined interface.

“Reducing adjustment time to seconds the new in-cab powered mirror control delivers convenient left- and right-side rearview mirror adjustments from the operator seat. The deluxe cab is available with high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter options to reduce operator exposure to potentially hazardous particles. Delivering more stabilised cabin pressurisation over all HVAC fan speeds the new design reduces respirable dust penetration up to 96% to keep operators healthier and more productive.”

“Every time we get a new machine at the quarry we feel that they are getting better. They are getting more sophisticated to help the operator run the machine” says Mario Amaran heavy equipment operator for CEMEX Quarry Miami Florida. “The panels and controls are within your reach without having to lose your focus on operating the machine. The comfort and the ride I compare it to my car out on the turnpike. It’s very comfortable even with our dirt road situations. We bring a lot of dirt to the hopper and the operators are happy.”

Boosting productivity

From secure push-button start to AutoHoist the next gen cab is equipped with a host of standard and optional features that improve efficiency and productivity. Eliminating the key and up to 30-second hold sequence for cold starting the new secure automated starting process enables all pre-start functions and checks to occur at the push of the button. A unique operator ID code authenticates the operator to improve security.

Enhanced Automatic Retarder Control (ARC) sets retarding speed based on grade payload and brake oil temperature and demonstrated up to 6% higher retarding speeds in feature validation. Operators can conveniently use the console’s rotary dial to set the maximum speed limit maintained during retarding without further actions to reduce fatigue and improve efficiency. Enhanced Cat Payload System delivers more accurate measurement of payloads with improved application monitoring interface for the technician and operator.

Multiple optional features customise the operator experience and improve efficiency in the next gen cab. AutoHoist automatically raises the truck body and controls the engine speed simplifying operation and can reduce the dump cycle time by up to 12 seconds. Offering feedback on truck operation to maximize its potential Speed Coaching provides a recommended speed indicating the machine capability for both propulsion and retarding. Maintained speed is set and controlled on-the-fly using a rotary dial with a Cruise Control option.

(Ben Hohenstatt / Juneau Empire)

Black-headed budworms are “disturbance agents” that can help spur new growth

A bump of atypically brown-tinged hemlock trees is evident on Mount McGinnis —at least on the recently rare days that it’s visible from the Mendenhall Glacier Visitor Center. When viewed through a pair of binoculars or a strong enough zoom lens it’s evident the trees are missing needles.

Similar discolored and patchy trees can be seen at other popular local recreation areas including the John Muir Trail as well as locations further afield in Southeast Alaska according to Elizabeth Graham entomologist for the U.S. Forest Service.

In both cases Graham said the off-looking trees are the work of the same voracious insect —black-headed budworms.

“This is a natural part of our forest” Graham said. “So the budworm’s been around as long as the trees have.”

These trees with a reddish-brown coloration are evidence of a black-headed budworm outbreak in Southeast Alaska. While there is visible defoliation in some popular spots around Juneau the impact is not limited to the capital city. Other impacted areas include Admiralty Baranof Kuiu Kupreanof Mitkof Wrangell and Zarembo islands according to the U.S. Forest Service. (Ben Hohenstatt / Juneau Empire)

The black-headed budworm is an insect native to the Western U.S. according to USFS. The caterpillar is what’s known as a “wasteful feeder” as it does not typically eat entire needles according to USFS. The partially eaten dead needles are what give trees like the hemlocks on McGinnis a brown or red appearance.

While black-headed budworms are always a part of Southeast Alaska’s forests outbreaks like the one ramping up aren’t especially common.

“It happens every 30-4o years or so here in Southeast” Graham said. “And it gets to the point where we have these whole hillsides that are defoliated.”

Conditions that can lead to an uptick in budworm population include warmer summers like the ones Southeast Alaska saw in 2018 and 2019 Graham said.

“It’s possible these populations were building then but we weren’t seeing them because they start up in the crown” Graham said.

The budworm-caused defoliation is likely to become more pronounced in the future too.

“This is still pretty light right now compared to some of the areas that have been hit really hard” Graham said. “Based on the number of moths that we’ve been seeing flying around town right now this is likely just the beginning of the outbreak so we’ll see more activity here in Juneau next year.”

This photo shows a western black-headed budworm caterpillar. The caterpillars are wasteful feeders that typically do not eat all of a needle. This leads to discoloration that can lead people to believe trees are dying. However Elizabeth Graham entomologist for the U.S. Forest Service said trees typically survive budworm outbreaks. (Courtesy Photo / U.S. Forest Service Alaska Region)

The moths are an indicator because budworms pupate and emerge as mottled moths that Graham said will likely be common to see fluttering around Juneau until October.

“They’re little brown or beige kind of rectangular-looking moths” Graham said. “They’re active during the day.”

Those moths which live for several weeks lay their eggs on hemlock needles. Eggs are laid on a one-per-bud basis to avoid pitting larvae against one another for food Graham said. Then in the summer around the same time that the buds burst the caterpillars burst and begin mining the buds before moving on to new growth. While hemlocks are a preferred host Graham said other coniferous trees including Sitka spruce may also provide food and shelter to black-headed budworms.

The wasteful feeding can lead to a “startling” red color on trees that people may mistake for a bark beetle attack Graham said. While growth may slow and the top third or so of a tree may die because of budworms trees are generally able to withstand the defoliation because they have older needles that the budworms tend to avoid.

While people may not like the appearance of budworm-nibbled trees Graham said they serve an important ecological role.

“They open up the canopy when there’s this kind of outbreak” she said. “It causes such an extreme amount of defoliation when they’re in this heavy amount that you’re going to get more light that comes down to the forest floor. They also increase the amount of nutrients going to the forest floor so they act as nutrient recyclers.”

That nutrient recycling is done through eating and excreting.

“A lot of people reported it sounding like raining in the summertime even though it wasn’t raining and that was the frass falling from the canopy and onto the devil’s club and the plants below” Graham said.

Trees’ company

The black-headed budworm isn’t the only insect that’s recently been noshing on Juneau’s hemlock trees.

There were outbreaks of hemlock sawflies another defoliator native to the area in 2018 and 2019 Graham said.

“They feed on the older needles so we have trees like ones on the John Muir Trail that were heavily hit by sawfly that don’t have many old needles” Graham said.

This July 2019 photo shows hemlock sawfly larvae. The larvae are among defoliating insects native to Southeast Alaska. (Courtesy Photo / U.S. Forest Service Alaska Region)

The combined effect of the two outbreaks could kill trees Graham said.

“We’ve had outbreaks like this in Southeast Alaska in the past” Graham said. “There was one in the 1950s where there was sawfly and budworm as well and in some areas there was mortality experienced and that’s just part of the changing forest. It creates new gaps and it’s one of our big disturbance agents that we have here.”

That leads to more understory and opens up spots for new trees to grow.

“It is important to distinguish this from a non-native insect” Graham said. “This isn’t something we would want to eradicate or control because in some ways it’s doing its job.”

Nothing lasts forever

Black-headed budworm outbreaks end without human intervention.

“It’s not going to sustain” Graham said. “Eventually it’s going to crash.”

She said outbreaks typically last for two to three years.

The caterpillars eventually run out of food to eat. Other limiting factors include a fungal disease a virus parasites and parasitic wasps.

“And then we won’t see a big outbreak again for hopefully a few more decades” Graham said.

Additionally the ongoing outbreak seems far less disruptive to human life than the one observed in the ’50s.

“It’s not as extreme as the outbreak in the ’50s” Graham said. “There were reports of 65 moths per square foot on the Juneau Icefield. They were getting blown up there. And there were planes flying out of Petersburg that reported moths hitting their windshield and having visibility issues because of that many moths flying. It can be a major event.” ‘

This is part of a series of demonstration projects in both transport and stationary power applications including prime power that the agreement covers.

The aim is to confirm the feasibility and performance of hydrogen for use as a commercially viable alternative to traditional fuels for line-haul rail and marine vessels and its use in prime power.

While hydrogen is viewed as an alternative power for local and regional passenger trains it is usually rejected as unsuitable for high-speed and heavy-haul freight.

The locomotive trial will be facilitated by Progress Rail a Caterpillar company with the companies also agreeing to demonstrate associated hydrogen-fuelling infrastructure.

He held a world record of 1093 patents which included inventions ranging from the incandescent light bulb the phonograph and the motion picture camera. Without Edison our modern phones TVs and even lightbulbs would possibly cease to exist.

As a way to honor Edison’s legacy the Edison Awards were created in 1987 to recognize the highest levels of new product and service development marketing human-centered design and innovation. Since their creation the awards have honored some of the most innovative products and business leaders in the world from Fortune 500s small start-ups and everything in between.

Every August to November nominations are sought from innovators in sixteen main categories which are divided into multiple sub-categories. The nominations are vetted by members of the Edison Award Steering Committee who present their finalists for selection to the Panel of Judges. This panel is composed of over 3000 senior business executives and academics from around the country. The awards are presented in the spring of the following year.

This year the Edison Awards added a COVID-19 Innovations category to recognize the fast advances made by companies to provide sanitization testing or emergency response systems in light of the pandemic. OptiCelan Dual-Mode Air Scrubber & Negative Air Machine by Carrier won gold in the Sanitizing Agents category. The machine cleans and removes air that has been potentially contaminated by coronavirus and prevents the movement of contaminated air from one room to another in hospital airborne isolation rooms.

The 2021 awards also honored many innovative and groundbreaking companies products and developments. For example in the Living & Working Environments category under Smart Productivity Tools Caterpillar Inc.’s Cat Command took the gold. Cat Command revolutionizes equipment operation by removing the operator from the machine and allowing them to work the machine thousands of miles away from a remote station. This opens up new possibilities like taking operators out of hazardous environments improving sightlines in tough applications and enabling operators to manage multiple machines at once.

The deadline for nominations of the 2022 Edison Awards is November 19 2021.

Like their fellow practitioners around the world floor traders at the Chicago Board Options Exchange have long communicated vital information via shouts and hand signals the color and detailing on their jackets identifying their role employer and other crucial information. Behind the often raucous scene however predictive mathe­matical formulas—algorithms—play an increasingly important role in electronic trading. That paradigm shift prompted Cboe Global Markets owners of the options exchange the largest in the U.S. to replace its longtime home in Chicago’s financial district with a state-of-the-art headquarters. The company tapped CannonDesign to identify a suitable site for the new digs and design them. “Cboe sought a transformational environment” begins design principal Mark Hirons who led the com­mission with Meg Osman Cannon project principal “one that reflects its strength global leadership and pioneering innovation within the marketplace.”

After carefully evaluating several nearby locations Hirons pitched the Old Chicago Main Post Office once the largest in the world. Built in 1921 the facility underwent a massive expansion in 1932 to handle the avalanche of goods shipped by mail-order-catalog companies such as Sears Roebuck and Montgomery Ward. Empty since 1997 the landmarked art deco colossus recently underwent an $800-million renovation by developer 601W Companies and Gensler. Comprising more than 2.5 million square feet of multiuse office and event space the project which claims to be the largest historic redevelopment in the nation is poised to become once again a central hub of the Windy City’s commercial life. “Both the USPS and Cboe were pioneers in different ways disrupters that had huge impacts on the economy” Hirons notes. “The context of the old post office served as a rich canvas to tell the future of Cboe’s story with a unique and authentic Chicago icon.”

Operable partitions sliding glass panels and felt curtains allow the town hall lounge to be easily reconfigured.

The 185000-square-foot headquarters encompasses three connected floors that straddle the original building and the later addition. The interior spaces create a dynamic undeniable modern milieu that coexists smoothly with protected historical architectural elements such as a mezzanine that now features a pair of glass-cube meeting rooms cantilevered over the reception area a nod to the observation boxes above the trading floors of yesteryear. In fact a trading floor is not part of the new workplace (Hirons and his team are designing a new one for Cboe in the historic Board of Trade building site of the company’s original trading pit) which along with the educational Options Institute and amenities for hosting international guests includes open work areas private offices electronic trading support facilities innumerable meeting rooms cafés and flexible lounges.

A sense of verve along with the algorithmic patterns that underlie today’s financial exchanges inspired much of the angular design. Most dramatic is the 140-foot-long white stretched ceiling extending from the elevator lobby down the length of reception a shiny multilevel feature that incorporates LED stock ticker feeds while bringing reflected light and views deep into the office. Beneath it the angular motif is echoed in a blue-and-white area rug as well as in light fixtures bronze-painted metal screens and furnishings throughout the project. “Cboe thrives on intense and volatile energy” Hirons says. “It was essential that the space created moments within that translated that experience.”

A lounge’s chairs are also by Lievore Altherr Molina. The colored jackets formerly worn by floor traders form a conference-room installation. Jordi Vilardell’s Slim pendant fixture illuminates a break-out booth.

Indeed a colorful installation of neatly folded traders’ jackets in a conference room speaks to the company’s storied past. The equally colorful cables that enable lightning-fast electronic trading are likewise celebrated in the elevator lobby where 30000 linear feet of multihued cords dangle from the soaring ceiling. “It creates a sense of immersive chaos” Hirons notes as do the many artworks that enliven the surroundings. “The extensive art and environmental graphics were designed to tell a story: the history of the organization” Osman adds. “They celebrate in a modern way the company’s beginnings unique place in the industry and overall trajectory.” A good example is a two-story wall sculpture that animates one of two new staircases linking the floors in the different buildings. Hundreds of highly polished yellow blue and green stainless-steel fins create a vortexlike arrangement that changes with the viewing angle. “It’s alive and interesting almost like a gallery that draws you from one floor to another” Hirons comments noting the rhythmic pattern is inspired by the wind on Lake Michigan the colors of the sky and the prairie.

The stretched ceiling incorporates stock tickers rendered in LEDs. Thousands of feet of colorful cables some looped turn the elevator lobby into an homage to the advanced technology that enables electronic trading.

While the pandemic has delayed the return of many employees to the office more appear by the month. Their response Hirons says has been universally positive. “This a memorable environment with Instagram moments but it also reflects their culture and tells their story in a way that feels fresh and engaging” he explains. “Cboe has an incredible history of having foreign dignitaries and leaders visit and is excited to continue that lineage going forward.” And once the new remote trading floor is completed an interactive monitor display will livestream the action to the new HQ furthering a sense of connectivity that links the company’s past present and future.

CBRE,CBRE Group,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzdG9kYXkuaW4vbWFnYXppbmUvaW5kdXN0cnkvc3RvcnkvdGhlLW5ldy1hdmF0YXItb2YtY293b3JraW5nLXNwYWNlcy0zMDU3NjItMjAyMS0wOS0xMdIBbWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzdG9kYXkuaW4vYW1wL21hZ2F6aW5lL2luZHVzdHJ5L3N0b3J5L3RoZS1uZXctYXZhdGFyLW9mLWNvd29ya2luZy1zcGFjZXMtMzA1NzYyLTIwMjEtMDktMTE?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The New Avatar of Coworking Spaces,"Work from home or back to the office — the debate still rages. While work from home or WFH as is common parlance now was a panacea for workflow disruption companies are acutely aware of the toll it has taken on mental health collaboration performance management and most importantly the work culture at their organisations. A recent survey by real estate consultancy firm CBRE showed that while the “purpose” of an office may have changed the relevance of a physical workplace remains undiminished.

The compromise so far has been a hybrid working model with some employees trudging back to offices and the rest working from home. But as the pace of vaccination picks up companies are gearing up to bring back more of their employees into a physical workplace. Only it may not necessarily be back to their office. Instead the coworking space is becoming an increasingly attractive proposition.

The strategy around new workplace models is now centred on flexibility to balance employee satisfaction with business requirements. And this is the biggest reason why after a year-long lull coworking space operators are bullish. Indian coworking firms have been bulking up with nearly 75000 seats leased this year. Their flex stock an industry term for a coworking space currently stands at 36 million sq. ft up from 31 million sq. ft last year according to CBRE and is expected to grow by 10-15 per cent annually over the next three years.

But inching back to business as usual is well not business as usual. The terms of negotiations between coworking companies and clients have transcended rental rates and other commercial fundamentals to the value proposition on offer. “The discussions are focused more on ensuring safety measures privacy data security personal security and density of the space” says Nidhi Marwah Managing Director-South Asia The Executive Centre.

With companies prioritising employee health and well-being as much as productivity both developers and landlords went back to the drawing board to rethink strategies and redesign workspaces. From hospital-grade air filtration to contactless sanitaryware and from bigger desk spaces to larger high-resolution screens coworking space operators are focusing on both health protocols and productivity upgrades to ensure employers and employees feel safe to get back to offices. And for now operators are happy to foot the bill as long as it generates demand.

Demand Drives All

The Covid-19 pandemic hit rental rates keeping them depressed through much of 2020. But coworking players always believed that would be a blip rather than a long-term price correction. Awfis which has more than 42000 seats in 75 locations saw a 7-10 per cent drop in rentals in the earlier part of 2020 says founder and CEO Amit Ramani. Unlike its peers the company negotiated with its landlords to switch to a revenue- or profit-sharing model which helped them tide over the uncertain period.

Now a gradual recovery has brought back rates to near pre-pandemic levels while sales have actually risen says Ramani. In fact except for March and April during the second wave of coronavirus infections Awfis has been selling double the number of seats it did before the pandemic. “With demand catching up with the supply prices will stabilise” says Ramani.

But while they are expanding coworking companies have changed their approach. Unlike in the boom years of 2017-2019 when operators would lap up office spaces purely on a speculative basis they are now following a demand-led acquisition policy says Karan Singh Sodi Regional Managing Director at consultancy firm JLL. “Since the lockdowns and the associated impact on the economy occupiers have been relying on coworking operators for their immediate real estate needs as they do not incur any capital expenditure and operators provide high levels of flexibility as far as tenure or contract periods are concerned” he says.

This flexibility is key as companies are currently operating with short-term visibility on headcount projections and business growth especially given the looming possibility of a third wave. And even if they hire companies aren’t yet sure if employees will need to go to an office or can work from home. Moreover companies’ real estate savings are much lower than they had projected as they are spending on things like ergonomic chairs and a better internet connection for employees working from home. In fact CBRE’s survey showed that the savings could be about 70 per cent lower than estimated in some cases.

All this means that employers prefer their employees back in a physical workspace even if it be a coworking one.

Checking In

Leading the pack in the absorption of coworking spaces have been the IT and ITES companies followed by start-ups. No surprise here given that many of these IT firms have announced robust hiring plans and are willing to go the extra mile to find the right talent irrespective of location. Interestingly the withdrawals are also largely from companies in the same sector points out Nirupa Shankar Executive Director Brigade Enterprises. “Consolidation expansion reduction and migration are the dominant reasons for the surrendering and taking up of spaces” she says.

WeWork India says that over the past year more large enterprises have shifted to flexible workspaces and signed long-term deals. More than 60 per cent of WeWork’s customers are large enterprises a portfolio that has risen by 10 per cent as firms including Khaitan & Co Commonwealth Bank of Australia Tata Sky Broadband and Colliers India move into its office spaces. “Despite the slowdown in absorption of commercial real estate Q1 2021 was one of the best quarters for us with 10000 desks and more than 7 lakh sq. ft of space being sold” says Santosh Martin Head of Sales WeWork India.

Moreover the geographic spread of coworking spaces is also growing. “Bengaluru currently holds the highest flex stock in the country. The flex segment is expected to witness further growth in cities like Pune and Chennai in the coming years” says Anshuman Magazine Chairman & CEO India South East Asia Middle East & Africa CBRE. A growing workforce is now choosing to live and work outside metros or shift back to their hometowns. This migration is generating demand for coworking spaces in tier-II cities such as Visakhapatnam Coimbatore Ahmedabad Lucknow Chandigarh and Jaipur.

The IWG Group formerly known as Regus recently signed franchise partnerships in Jaipur and Mohali. “We are witnessing a high percentage of firms moving to a decentralised structure and operating from a ‘hub-and-spoke’ model” says Harsh Lambah Country Manager India Vice President Sales South Asia India IWG. “We want to expand this footprint further to touch even more state capitals and tier-II and III cities such as Panipat and Kochi.”

It remains to be seen if the capital-light model of coworking spaces is merely a short-term stop-gap measure for companies or a longer-term play. Operators though are pulling out all the stops to ensure that customers never leave.

The Makeover

From now on higher quality build-outs and wellness-related offerings will be the differentiating factors between coworking companies says CBRE’s Anshuman Magazine. “Technology will serve as a key enabler with contactless design air filtration thermal screening and the provision for high-yield collaboration tools” he says. These range from everyday use cases such as contactless elevators and sensor-based faucets to productivity hacks such as high-speed internet and state-of-the-art videoconferencing facilities. And they are already becoming the norm.

The most basic change at every coworking space is adoption of protocols for social distancing in common areas such as lobbies and elevators. Some like 91 Springboard have also shut their food and beverage outlets for now for safety. The biggest additional recurring cost for operators is housekeeping hygiene and cleanliness. But clients are happy to pay more since safety and hygiene aren’t up for compromise.

91 Springboard also offers additional conveniences for clients who have opted for private offices or where a team sits within a private enclosure essentially forming a mini-bubble says co-founder and CEO Anand Vemuri. “At present we have an occupancy level of 40 per cent and implementing social distancing is not a challenge” he says. In fact some firms are looking for bigger desks to maintain social distancing. “Some customers are looking for the desk size to be a bit larger. Earlier they were 4 feet by 2 feet while now they are looking at 5x3 feet or 6x2 feet” says Awfis’s Ramani.

And while bigger desks or more spaced-out desks could eat into the total number of seats on offer operators are happy to comply since like Vemuri says they are not operating at full capacity and have room to spare. So until occupancy rises they are willing to make such adjustments as long as clients are willing to pay higher rentals for exclusive or roomier layouts. Moreover these are nuts-and-bolts adjustments that can be rolled back without much hassle whenever required.

With air quality and hygiene becoming critical companies are also flaunting wellness-related certifications. For instance WeWork recently got a global certification from The British Safety Council for health and safety measures. On the other hand the Brigade Group uses Clarico’s app-enabled monitors to ensure superior air quality. 315Work Avenue went a step ahead and hired doctors to bring in best practices. “We have come up with differentiating products like making use of an ‘Ioniser’ a patented technology that provides hospital-standard air filtration” says founder Manas Mehrotra.

And for the most part coworking firms are happy to absorb the incremental costs for such safety and hygiene measures to reel in clients. But once the demand and supply mismatch evens out they plan on passing on some of these costs to their clients. Experts point out the rising interest from large enterprises could lead to incremental demand in the short- and mid-term.

As the corporate juggernaut limps back to normal coworking spaces might yet turn out to be the out-of-left-field unexpected winner in the debate on work from home or back to office.

The city plans to hire 20-30 social workers beginning in October. The Brown School will help recruit workers provide professional development and partner in the ongoing planning of the program.



“I believe that social workers are miracle workers” St. Louis Mayor Tishaura Jones said in describing the initiative during an Aug. 25 panel discussion that was part of the Brown School’s Open Classroom series. “I was excited to find ways to partner with Washington University to bring more social workers into our city government.”



“I’ve often said we have to put the ‘public’ back in public safety” Jones said. “This is an innovative program aimed at integrating mental and behavioral health into public safety.”



Mary McKay the Neidorff Family and Centene Corporation Dean of the Brown School said that social workers are trained to understand individual trauma and mental health issues as well as root causes of problems that affect entire communities.



“They’re going to bring a lens of ‘How do we help individuals?’ but also ‘How do we also really change what happens to a population?’” she said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Tips for surviving a power outage during a flood,"Neighborhood flooding is stressful alone but when the power goes out a new set of problems unfold — here are some helpful tips.

HOUSTON — Power outages can often be unpredictable and frustrating during floods not knowing exactly when your home will lose power or when lost power will be restored.

While we're sharing important information about dealing with power outages during a flood it's always best to be as knowledgeable and prepared before the storm arrives.

First here are a few tips to keep in mind if you suspect power may go out during a flood or intense flood.

Power outage preparedness

Power out means lights out. You'll want to move your flashlights lanterns or candles to a spot that easily accessible so you're not fumbling around the dark.

Double check that your flashlight has batteries and is functional. It's also smart to buy extra batteries. It's the same with candles and lanterns make sure you have lighters or matches handy or any necessary fluids.

Be sure to turn candles and lantern off before bed and never leave candles or lanterns unattended!

What's in the fridge? It's strongly advised to have only nonperishable foods or counter-safe (some vegetables fruits bread) in the home. But if there's an item you can't part with and must be kept cold here's an idea: have a styrofoam or other portable cooler a quick-response thermometer and bags of ice handy.

Plus if the weather is hot and humid that ice can be useful in keeping you cool.

Electric stoves are useless during a power outage and using a generator to power an electric stove or microwave can be dangerous. Plus they can take up a lot of power in a short amount of time.

Before the storm is your chance to prepare other options: mini folding camp stove with canned fuel self-heating portable meals or portable butane stove.

Charcoal and propane grills which must be used only outdoors with adequate space are other good options.

How do I keep my phone and other devices charged? In the hours leading up to storm conditions that can cause flooding you will want to minimalize your device usage and allow them to charge to 100%.

If you have portable chargers — great! Make sure those are fully charged as well. They'll definitely come in handy.

If you have a vehicle and it's safe to be outside charging your phone in the car is a great backup option. REMEMBER: Do not sit in a running vehicle in a closed garage or other closed space. You could get carbon monoxide poisoning.

Generator safety

Of course if you have a generator a power outage is the optimal time to put it to use. Do not use generators indoor or a closed garage.

Generators are helpful machines but the carbon-monoxide and other fumes they produce can be deadly.

Upshur Rural Electric Cooperative Corporation offers the following advice:

Be sure to know your generator. Read all of the information on installation safety and maintenance. Follow instructions regarding maintenance and testing.

When a generator is not properly installed it can ""backfeed"" through the transformer and produce an output of 7200 volts on the distribution line. As a result a line crew working on the system would be put in danger.

Isolate your generator. Keep your generator away from the power lines. Connect appliances and other devices directly to the generator with the appropriate-sized cords.

If you connect it directly to your building's wiring a transfer double-throw switch is required to separate your generator from the your service provider's system.

Take care when fueling. Never try to refuel the unit while it is operating. Avoid spilling gasoline or other fuels on hot components.

Provide adequate ventilation. Give your generator adequate ventilation and air cooling to prevent overheating and the accumulation of toxic exhaust fumes. Do not install your generator in a basement or any closed area.

Exhaust gases contain carbon monoxide which is an odorless invisible poisonous gas.

Beware of electrical lines even if power is down

During a flood it is important to shelter in place or stay where it is dry and safe! If it is an emergency or your shelter is compromised forcing you to leave your home be extremely cautious.

Don't try to leave in stormy weather conditions or during dark or nighttime hours.

If you're on foot beware of power lines and electrical wires — even if the area is experiencing a power outages. Also be aware that electrical currents can travel through water.

Rule: treat all downed powerlines as if they're energized.

CenterPoint Energy said you should stay at least 10 feet away from any downed power lines and objects it may be touching. Be especially mindful of downed power lines that could be hidden in flood waters.",,,,,,,,,,,,

CMG,Chipotle Mexican Grill,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWNvbGR3aXJlLmNvbS93aHktaXMtY2hpcG90bGUtc3RvY2stc28taGlnaC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Is Chipotle's Stock So High? (10 Reasons),"Chipotle’s stock has recently seen a very large increase.

The price of the stock has gone up so much recently that many people are wondering how this can be.

With Chipotle’s stock increasing the overall quality of the product gets questioned.

People always want to know the perfect time to get in on a stock so if you are thinking it could be now we have all the answers you might need.

Here are ten reasons Chipotle’s stock is so high and what you should do about it.

Why Is Chipotle’s Stock So High? (10 Reasons)

1. Increased Online Sales

The very first reason Chipotle’s stock is so high is that its sales are increasing online.

If you know anything about the internet and the way it can drive business then you likely understand how important digital sales are.

Companies are looking to increase their digital sales each and every quarter.

Through online marketing promotion and ease of use for a customer sales can increase and improve quite rapidly.

The digital sales for Chipotle have grown tremendously since it has opened and just recently they took another jump of about 10% before this most recent increase in stock prices.

Almost half of the sales that the company does are digital sales and it is starting to really shine above its competitors in the same market.

There are several reasons Chipotle stands out from the competition and we will get into those a bit more as we move through our top ten reasons.

2. Overall Increase In Popularity

Chipotle continues to get more and more popular.

The thing that brings people back to Chipotle over and over again is the consistency.

It really doesn’t matter which Chipotle location you go to the food quality and taste will be identical.

This is why the company has grown so well through the years.

People have come to understand what the product is and they know they are going to get a quality meal when they stop in and order from Chipotle.

Overall people care more about consistency in fast food than they even do about overall taste.

However the taste profile for Chipotle is quite diverse while still using very few ingredients.

This can really help to ensure that a large majority of customers are satisfied.

With small restaurants going out of business and people being busier than ever a quick meal from Chipotle could be a major reason the chain continues to grow in popularity.

Any time a company is growing and expanding you can expect to see its stock prices continue to go up.

If you watch trends like this you can make some good investments into your stock portfolio.

3. Restaurants Handcuffed Due To Covid

Chipotle was one of those restaurants that actually saw an increase in sales with the pandemic.

So many small restaurants had to shut down or limit their capacity.

These came as a result of covid restrictions but also because of staffing issues.

Chipotle could make some exceptions because of the way its food is served.

Although you can eat inside a Chipotle location most people will choose to take their food to go.

This is not quite the same for a fine Italian restaurant or a high-end Japanese steakhouse.

Most people expect these types of eating experiences to be in-house.

When those eating experiences could not be completed inside the restaurant people took their business elsewhere.

Chipotle made the perfect medium option between fast food joints and restaurants that could no longer accommodate the people.

The reason Chipotle stands out as being a bit better than standard fast food is the quality of the ingredients and the overall health of the products it serves.

If you want to keep things healthy at Chipotle it is possible.

Therefore with restaurants shutting down and indoor dining being limited those who were in search of a quick and tasty meal simply would stop by Chipotle and grab something to go.

This was reflected quite clearly in their stock prices earlier this year.

4. Starting To Introduce More Dining Room Sales

Now that some people are vaccinated for Covid they are more comfortable with starting to go out and eat inside a restaurant.

For Chipotle the decrease in dining room sales was a significant one but it was made up for by digital sales.

However now that people are going back out again the digital sales are continuing to rise but the dining room sales are rising as well.

This is why Chipotle’s numbers are looking so good and getting more and more attention from investors.

Instead of simply increasing in one area they are increasing in all areas.

The dining room and the digital sales are going up and the company has shareholders and those who understand the value of a stock starting to pay close attention.

The great thing about Chipotle is that it has a ton of flexibility in the way it can serve and prepare its product.

Customers feel safe about the way the food is handled and as they head back out into the world to eat out Chipotle’s numbers are only going to increase.

Overall we don’t expect to see a downturn at any time regardless of what continues to happen with the Covid pandemic.

5. Only A Certain Number Of Shares

When some people talk about the price of Chipotle stock they will tell you that it is actually not all that expensive.

This is because the price of the stock is actually a relative thing.

Think of stock in the same way you think of fine art.

When an artist only makes one original painting that painting sells for a large sum of money.

However the reproductions of those paintings only sell for a small amount because they are much easier to get.

Chipotle has a small market share.

They don’t have nearly as many stocks as other companies do and that ends up impacting the overall pricing that you pay for the stock.

When companies have quite a few the pricing may be lower and then some companies have a limited number of stocks and you can expect the pricing to be very high.

Some Chipotle investors will tell you that they don’t think the pricing of the Chipotle stock is all that high; it is simply that there are not that many of the Chipotle shares on the market for investors to buy.

As an owner of Chipotle stocks you have a much greater percentage of the company.

6. Beating Goals

All companies will set goals and projections.

These goals are not just for the individual store managers and employees but they are also used for the shareholders and the business analysts.

The object of the goal is to meet or exceed it.

If you happen to have a very good year chances are you are going to beat your goal.

The thing about Chipotle is that it continues to beat its goals year after year.

From the time the company has started it has been very set on meeting its goals and ensuring that it continues to get better each and every quarter.

There is no question you can watch the growth and the expansion plan that Chipotle has been on and see that it is working quite well for the company.

Many years ago you would probably have had no idea how this company would take off and prosper.

If we could only rewind the clocks and invest in this stock things would likely be quite a bit different for all of us.

Imagine purchasing Chipotle stock when it was $22 per share.

Today Chipotle stock is close to $2000 per share.

This means that a $10000 investment when the company first went public would now be worth over three-quarters of a million dollars.

Certainly this would be a life-changing gain from just one company.

However this is the interest that keeps many people investing in the stock market and continuing to learn about what will make it and what won’t.

The more time you spend learning and growing your knowledge the better chance you have of making it big on one of these stocks.

As always it is also smart to talk to investors about these stocks and their results so that you can make informed and knowledgeable decisions.

7. Profitable Business Model

Another reason that Chipotle stock is so high is that its business model is profitable.

Those who invest in a stock or product want to know that the business model is going to continue to be successful for years to come.

The business model for Chipotle allows for the same ingredients to be used in a variety of different ways.

This limits the product of different foods and allows for consistency in the product.

People know that they have several options from Chipotle and they can vary their meals based on these options.

Everyone is comfortable with this and the ability to customize your salad bowl or burrito to meet your needs is something that sets Chipotle apart.

Although you can ask for a McDonald’s hamburger without the ketchup the customization options are not nearly the same as they are with Chipotle.

Essentially the Chipotle business model was built to last and it has proven year after year that it is going to continue to grow and expand.

The business model that is in place is a significant reason stock prices continue to rise.

If Chipotle decides to change up the way it does business chances are the stock will get a bit shaky for a while until we see the way the changes are going to impact the company.

8. Trusted Product

The Chipotle product is a trusted product and because of that the stock becomes a trusted product.

Even as people start to eat healthier with more care and attention to animals and their lives Chipotle is at the forefront of all these issues.

The company offers healthier options than other fast food restaurants and it is open about its ingredients the quality and where they are sourced from.

In addition you can customize a Chipotle product to meet your needs specifically.

You can look at the products and decide that something appeals to you one day and not another and the ingredients are all options that you can trust.

People just don’t have the same trust for a piece of fish from a Long John Silver’s.

The trust for Chipotle was not something that was given to it but it was earned through the years.

The stock is very similar.

Those who have invested in the Chipotle stock have seen some significant gains.

This has made the stock that much more of a trusted product.

People who purchased Chipotle stock have seen ups and downs through the years but overall they have been very happy with the overall performance of the brand.

Therefore the trusted product is continuing to raise the price that people will pay for the stock.

9. Overall Good Branding And Name

The Chipotle brand is very strong.

Chipotle stands behind its product they are nice to their customers and they put out one good meal after another.

In addition the Chipotle brand tries to be fair to their employees so that they return and continue to want to work there.

The branding of the name and putting the entire company together as a whole have helped to increase the price of the stock.

Even the colors and the packaging from one Chipotle to the next will be consistent.

This is something that customers are looking for and something that they will enjoy.

If you ask customers what their complaints are about certain smaller restaurants it is that the product is different each time.

This is because these smaller restaurants don’t have the time or the funds to spend on the branding and the quality of the name of their product.

Food can be very subjective.

One person thinks a meal is excellent and another thinks it is the worst they have ever had.

However Chipotle stands out as being a good product overall with great branding and a strong name.

This has continued to increase the price of its stock for many years.

The question remains whether or not this will be enough to continue to increase the stock for many more years.

As many investors would like to know how high can Chipotle go?

Only time will tell.

10. Provides A Good Stock For Buyers

Last but certainly not least the Chipotle stock has proven to be an excellent option for those who invest in the stock market.

If you are new to the stock market you may not quite understand how to follow it and how you will start to watch certain companies.

Some of the companies in your portfolio will become your favorites simply because they continue to perform year after year.

Chipotle is one of these stocks.

Those who invest in this company feel strongly about the future of the company and where the stock prices are headed.

If you are a fan of a product it makes sense to look into the company and see if it could be worth buying their stock.

The truth about many of the Chipotle stock owners is that they knew this product was good because they enjoyed it themselves.

This has created a loyal group of shareholders who genuinely enjoy being a part of all that Chipotle has to offer.

Some stocks won’t ever do anything for you or they will help you lose significant amounts of money but Chipotle is one that people enjoy owning and following.

Although the price is relatively high to get in now it will still be interesting to see how many more people want a piece of what Chipotle has to offer.

Conclusion

Seeing the progression of companies like Chipotle is almost remarkable.

If we all had a crystal ball that could have told us which companies would make it through the pandemic and thrive and which would crash it would take all the fun out of this world.

Getting to learn about how a business puts together its product and takes it to the next level is the fun of being involved in the stock market.

If Chipotle is a bit too expensive for you at this point it makes sense to go find something similar to Chipotle that is just starting out and see if you can make yourself some money.

CB,Chubb Limited,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlbnZlcnBvc3QuY29tLzIwMjEvMDkvMTEvbmZsLXRvcC1wYXNzLXJ1c2hpbmctZHVvcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Where does Von Miller-Bradley Chubb rank among NFL's best pass rushing duos?,"Our ranking of the NFL’s top 10 pass-rushing duos entering the season:

1. Pittsburgh — T.J. Watt/Stephon Tuitt: Watt led the NFL with 15 sacks last year has missed only two games in four seasons and has 49 1/2 sacks in 62 games. He is a dominant player. Tuitt 28 had a breakout 2020 (11 sacks; previous career high was 6 1/2 in ’15) and feasts on single match-ups because teams pay so much attention to Watt.

2. Tampa Bay — Shaq Barrett/Jason Pierre-Paul: For good measure we should add blitzing linebacker Devin White to this list. Barrett the former Broncos undrafted free agent had eight sacks last year and Pierre-Paul had 9 1/2.

3. L.A. Rams — Aaron Donald/Leonard Floyd: Donald is the NFL’s best defensive player. Period. He has four consecutive years of at least 11 sacks and is a one-man wrecking crew when going against centers and guards. Floyd a first-round pick by Chicago was the main beneficiary of teams trying to block Donald. Floyd had a career-best 10 1/2 sacks last year.

4. Broncos — Von Miller/Bradley Chubb: The only time they played a full season together Miller had 14 1/2 sacks and Chubb 12 in 2018. Chubb was limited to four games in ’19 (ACL) and Miller missed all of ’20 (ankle surgery). Matching their ’18 form is a big ask but there’s no reason why they shouldn’t combine for at least 20 sacks.

5. Washington — Chase Young/Montez Sweat: It only seems like Washington has 42 quality defensive linemen. Jon Allen is a force on early downs and Young and Sweat are already a disrupting pass-rush duo. Sweat had nine sacks last year and Young had 7 1/2 as a rookie. The up-front talent allows Washington to rush four and drop seven into coverage.

6. Kansas City — Frank Clark/Chris Jones: Clark has 14 sacks in 29 games for the Chiefs over two years since his trade from Seattle. It feels like he should be more productive. Jones is the NFL’s best interior pass rusher not named Aaron Donald. Jones only 27 had 15 1/2 sacks in ’18 but his total has dipped to nine in ’19 and 7 1/2 last year.

7. Carolina — Haason Reddick/Brian Burns: An interesting decision by Arizona to let Reddick depart in free agency after he posted a team-high 12 1/2 sacks. He joins the Panthers’ defense where he will line up opposite Burns who had nine sacks last year.

8. Green Bay — Za’Darius Smith/Preston Smith: Big Z has been an astute free-agent addition by a Packers organization that normally focuses on signing their in-house players. Since joining from the Ravens he has had seasons of 13 1/2 and 12 1/2 sacks. The Packers need a bounce-back season from Preston Smith who had 12 sacks for them in ’19 but only four last year.

9. Arizona — J.J. Watt/Chandler Jones: The Cardinals are banking on Watt released by Houston in the offseason to a) stay healthy and b) semi-approach his previous form like 16 sacks in 2018. Similarly they are betting that Jones limited to five games last year returns to his durable self and makes it seven double-digit sack seasons.

10. Chicago — Khalil Mack/Robert Quinn: The Bears swung for the fences after the 2018 preseason trading two first-round picks to Las Vegas for Mack. The return so far? No playoff wins in two appearances and diminished production (12 1/2 sacks to 8 1/2 to nine).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pbGVoaWdocmVwb3J0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzkvMTIvMjI2NzAyODYvYnJvbmNvcy1naWFudHMtaW5hY3RpdmVz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Denver Broncos vs. New York Giants inactives: Bradley Chubb OUT,"The Denver Broncos decided during warm-ups that edge rusher Bradley Chubb needs at least another week of limited work to get game ready on that ankle. Malik Reed will fill in that spot against the New York Giants across from Von Miller.

Everyone else from the injury report this week are good to go including star tight end Noah Fant. Other inactives for the Broncos will be cornerback Kary Vincent Jr. and running back Nate McCrary. Instead it will be running back Damarea Crockett and cornerback Nate Hairston on the active roster this week as both look to be a better fit for special teams.

For the Giants they’ll get their star running back Saquon Barkley for this game. However they won’t have their tight end Evan Engram for this game. The Giants offense is a different beast with Barkley in so it could be difficult for the Broncos defense here on the road.

Meanwhile linebacker Bradley Chubb — whom then-Broncos general manager John Elway chose to draft over Allen at No. 5 overall in 2018 — spent his training camp reacclimatizing to football after ankle surgery in May set his 2021 timetable back.

In that way the contrast in the players’ career trajectories is evident. Allen keeps getting better and is viewed as an MVP candidate. Chubb meanwhile is still looking to prove himself.

Chubb earned a Pro Bowl nod last year but missed most of 2019 with an ACL injury and has played a full season only once as a rookie which is also the only season he’s had double-digit sacks.

While Allen shoulders Super Bowl expectations in Buffalo it’s put-up-or-shut-up time for Chubb and the Broncos after four consecutive losing seasons. Chubb believes he’s capable of again stacking big sack totals alongside Von Miller who missed all of 2020 with an ankle injury.

“Ever since I’ve been here we haven’t had a winning record” Chubb said. “That leaves a sour taste in everybody’s mouth especially with the tradition the Broncos have…We need to get back to that.”

Chubb who accumulated 7.5 sacks and 42 tackles in 14 games last year missed the final two games with an ankle injury. He initially thought the ankle would heal itself but it didn’t requiring surgery to remove bone fragments that kept him out of offseason activities.

But the 25-year-old has been amping up throughout training camp and the preseason. Broncos’ coach Vic Fangio believes Chubb will be ready to take on a full snap count by Sunday’s opener at the Giants. Chubb looked the part with a sack in his preseason debut Aug. 23 in Seattle.

That was a welcome sight for Miller who described his pass-rushing counterpart as “a beast” and believes Chubb is ready to again be a catalyst on a Broncos defense that is expected to be the strength of the team. The duo was dominant in 2018 combining for 26.5 sacks but haven’t had much of a chance to gel since Fangio’s hiring after that season. Chubb and Miller have only played four games together over the past two seasons with all four coming during Denver’s 0-4 start in 2019.

“(Chubb’s) continued to get better and better and that’s scary to even think about” Miller said. “He’s jumping the snap count at 280 pounds… That’s my right-hand man and I’m excited to play with him. I’ve got to get to the quarterback a couple seconds faster to get to these sacks because he’s going to be on them.”

Of course that was exactly what the Broncos envisioned when they drafted the North Carolina State standout in 2018.

Well aware of the comparisons to Allen’s production since that draft Chubb is hungry to deliver on the promise that Elway saw.

“I really didn’t care (people were upset Allen wasn’t picked)… The Broncos wanted me and I feel like it’s been a good relationship these past few years and we’re looking to make it better” Chubb said. “I know they had a successful season last year in Buffalo but now it’s our turn to have a successful season here — make it to the playoffs and the ultimate goal is that Super Bowl.”",,,,,,

Before the Reformation these brightly-coloured depictions of Christ’s judgement were common.

They allowed illiterate worshippers to understand that sinning meant a journey to Hell but righteousness meant eternal life.

During the 16th century they were considered a bit too Popish and the vast majority were plastered over or destroyed.

Now at the rural St Mary’s church in Woodham Ferrers near Chelmsford Essex a newly completed Doom painting can be seen.

It was based on the traces of the original that decorated the chancel arch and following close examination of those Doom paintings that remain.

The name Doom is derived from dom an old English word for judgement.

Using authentic pigments gold leaf and brushes made from hog and squirrel hair Steve Lawes a medieval art expert painted a version of the original.

Like most Doom paintings it is a representation of the Last Judgement at Christ’s second coming as described in Matthew 25:

“When the Son of Man comes in his glory and all the angels with him he will sit on his throne in heavenly glory.”

The painting depicts the righteous climbing from their graves to eternal life and the unrighteous – including a clergyman and king – departing to their eternal punishment.

Other features include the Apostles without Judas a citadel representing heaven and the jaws of Hell. Christ bleeding from the nails and with a gaping wound in his side is flanked by his mother Mary and John the Baptist.

Steve said: “The church’s original Doom it is thought was painted in the 1420s or 1430s and was plastered over during the Reformation.

“The Victorians uncovered it in 1884 but since then it has suffered further and it is now hard to discern.

“So it was a genuine thrill to be asked to recreate it using traditional techniques. A great deal of research had been done on the original with regard to the pigments used.

“And with the knowledge gained from examining the country’s more complete paintings I was able to interpret the Woodham Ferrers’ version.

“It is not as big as the original but I hope it captures the colour and drama and that it provides a sense of what worshippers would once have been looking at as they attended services.

“We are not used to our churches being decorated with bright coloured paintings but it was once common.”

Nia McIntosh a heritage consultant using money from the National Heritage Lottery Fund has overseen a wide Heritage Hub project at St Mary’s.

She said: “The original Doom has been through a lot over the years. It was damaged in a storm in 1989 and has deteriorated further despite conservation interventions.

“It’s now very hard to see which was why we wanted to find out what it had looked like originally and create a new version. We were able to with money from the Friends of Friendless Churches.

“My desire was to bring the painting to life for our visitors and congregation; to create more of an immersive experience and transport people back to the medieval period.

“Steve is an expert in this area and he examined the parts that remain of the original and studied documentary evidence from examinations since it re-emerged in 1884.

“Tests were done on the remaining paint to establish exactly what pigments were used and examination into extant Dooms enabled an interpretation which is as close as we can get.

“I’m sure there hasn’t been a Doom painting using traditional techniques created for a parish church since the Reformation.

“St Mary’s has other medieval paintings and decorations and we are currently hosting an exhibition and events to celebrate it.”

The exhibition Doom and discovery; wall paintings in the medieval church runs until the middle of June.

Other experts involved include Sara Charles a medieval book production expert who hand made the original recipe pigments and the brushes.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndlY2IuZm0vNjAteWVhcnMtbGF0ZXItaGUtbGVhcm5zLXRoYXQtaGlzLWNoaWxkaG9vZC1maW5kcy11bmRlci1hLWNodXJjaC1hcmUtYWN0dWFsbHktYS1yZWFsLXRyZWFzdXJlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,60 Years Later He Learns That His Childhood Finds Under A Church Are Actually A Real Treasure,"Back in 1964 a young Norwegian boy Jan Gunnar Fuglesnes and his brother were simply having fun exploring beneath the floorboards of a church. What started as an innocent childhood adventure led to a discovery that would take nearly six decades to reveal its true significance.

Childhood Games Historic Finds

It was a different time when Jan and his brother crawling through the spaces dug by Nazi soldiers during World War II to store ammunition stumbled upon what they thought were just cool trinkets to enhance their playtime. Among these were 14 silver coins an amber bead and nine needles all found in a setting that couldn’t be further from a typical playground.

Little did they know their ‘playthings’ were genuine artifacts. The coins safely tucked away in a small yellow Kodak slide box were forgotten as the brothers grew up only to be rediscovered by Jan in November 2023 nearly 60 years later. This prompted him to report the find to the local authorities in Møre og Romsdal County.

A Treasure Dating Back to the Middle Ages

The coins weren’t just old; they were ancient. Preliminary analysis by archaeologists suggested these pieces dated back to the Middle Ages. “We were just kids doing a treasure hunt under the church not realizing how rare these coins were” Jan shared. This sentiment echoed a childlike wonder akin to a poignant scene from the film Amélie where childhood treasures hold emotional value only in Jan’s case these items held substantial archaeological value as well.

Carl-Fredrik Wahr-Hansen Vemmestad the county archaeologist identified that some coins might date back to around 1280 during the reign of King Marcus VI of Norway. Others could be a bit more recent from the time of King Christian I who ruled from 1450 to 1481. “Such finds are extremely rare as there are literally only a handful of these coins that have survived to this day in central Norway” explained Vemmestad.

More Than Just Coins

The seemingly mundane items found alongside the coins also turned out to be historically significant. The needles were dated to the 13th century likely part of a garment belonging to a deceased individual while the amber bead might have come from a prayer crown used by priests and deacons.

Following the guidelines of Norway’s archaeological preservation policy which states that all artifacts found that were made before 1605 are considered state property unless owned privately before 1905 Jan handed over his childhood treasures to the local authorities. These artifacts are now slated for preservation and may even be displayed to the public.

In a twist fit for the movies what Jan and his brother saw as simple elements of childhood games turned out to be treasures of a nation preserving a slice of history beneath the floorboards of a quiet church. This story not only highlights the unexpected corners where history can lurk but also reminds us of the pure joy of discovery a feeling that doesn’t fade even after 60 years.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vY2EubmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vZmlyZS1kZXN0cm95cy0xMjMtb2xkLWNodXJjaC0xODE2MjM4MTkuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fire destroys 123-year-old church in Greenwood B.C.,"A devastating overnight fire in the tiny city of Greenwood B.C. has razed a historic church vacant elementary school one home and a neighbouring garage.

""No lives are lost thank God"" said Greenwood Mayor John Bolt speaking to CBC Kelowna on Friday morning. ""Everything is under control now.""

Firefighters from Greenwood Midway and Grand Forks attended the fire which is believed to have started in the 123-year-old St. Jude's Anglican Church at around 2:30 a.m. PT Friday.

Officials say the cause of the fire is under investigation.

Bishop Lynne McNaughton of the Anglican Diocese of Kootenay said the church has not been used as a site of worship for a number of years. She said half of the property had been turned into a community garden with beehives.

""There's not a congregation that's been displaced by this"" said McNaughton. ""Obviously there's a shock and sadness about the building.

""I spoke to the local priest this morning ... and what she said was that there's nothing of historical value inside nothing of monetary value [or] sentimental value.""

McNaughton said the church was not a designated heritage building.

Midway fire chief Mike Daloise said the buildings were fully engulfed when firefighters arrived.

He said crews worked hard to stop the fire from spreading to adjacent homes although three did sustained heat damage to their sidings.

Firefighters had switched to mop up stage by Friday morning according to Greenwood Fire Chief Roy Terashita and were thankful for the food locals were delivering to the site to feed them.

""It was a great effort from all three fire departments"" said Terashita.

Hardy Skott owner of the Copper Creek Country Store located about a block away from the fire said things could have turned out much worse.

""This could have burned down the whole town"" said Skott. ""Embers were falling from the sky blocks away.""

Skott said he wished officials had alerted residents and business owners when news of the fire broke. He said the area around Greenwood like many parts of the province has been extremely dry with a heightened fire risk.

McNaughton said the community was rallying to support the woman who has been displaced by the fire.

""My prayers go out to the person who lost their home"" she said. ""I know that the Greenwood community will surround that person and we've reached out to [her] to say 'what can we do?'""

Greenwood is known as Canada's smallest incorporated city with an estimated population of 700. It is located in south central B.C.'s Boundary Region."

Sebagai pasangan keduanya memiliki kehidupan perkawinan yang sempurna. Mereka punya cinta yang sama besarnya satu sama lain. Namun di balik kehidupan yang sempurna terselip kekecewaan-kekecewaan yang lambat tetapi pasti menjadi bom waktu yang mengancam pernikahan mereka.

Dan laiknya sebuah pernikahan manis dan pahit berkelindan. Ketika madu di awal pernikahan mulai terasa hambar pernikahan seolah berjalan menuju ambang kepahitan.

Masa-masa suram kehidupan pernikahan Mira dan Jonathan tergambar dalam trailer Scenes From A Marriage yang terasa menggerus emosi merangkum pemandangan dari sebuah kehidupan yang kompleks. Ada sisi yang membahagiakan tetapi juga ada sisi-sisi yang menyakitkan. Perjalanan Mira dan Jonathan tak pelak sangat menguras emosi dan air mata.

Akting Jessica dan Oscar yang matang menghidupkan kembali Scenes From A Marriage yang kini diadaptasi untuk televisi oleh Hagai Levi dan Amy Herzog disutradarai Hagai Levi. Scenes From A Marrige akan mulai tayang di HBO.GO dan HBO pada Senin (13/9/2021) pukul 08.00 dengan penayangan ulang pada hari yang sama pukul 21.00 di HBO.

ARSIP HBO Salah satu adegan ”Scenes From A Marriage”.

Meski Jessica dan Oscar adalah kawan lama—keduanya teman satu kelas saat bersekolah di Julliard dan mulai bekerja sama tahun 2014 di Film A Most Violent Year keduanya mampu tampil profesional dengan akting yang memukau. Dialog akting mereka sangat intens. Penonton akan mampu menyaksikan bagaimana keduanya masuk ke dalam karakter mereka dan menyeret penonton ke dalam lika-liku kehidupan mereka.

Ada kalanya keduanya menghadirkan adegan serius hangat dan romantis. Membawa penonton turut merasakan kehangatan relasi dan juga cinta di antara mereka. Namun ada kalanya meledak-ledak menggerus emosi dengan dialog-dialog yang kuat.

Akting Jessica jelas sangat berkarakter dan kuat. Namun akting Oscar yang frustasi bahkan terasa jauh lebih kuat dan hidup. Penonton seolah dibawa ke dalam suasana muram dan gelap yang dalam oleh totalitas akting Oscar.

Begitu menjiwainya Jessica dan Oscar hingga mereka sulit melepaskan karakter mereka dalam kehidupan nyata. Dalam wawancara dengan The New York Times Jessica mengatakan bahkan dia sampai menangis setiap hari selama empat bulan. Sementara Isaac mendekor kamar anak perempuannya yang suasananya persis dalam film dan tak tahu mana yang akting dan mana yang kehidupan nyata. ”Ini sungguh sangat berat” kata Oscar.

ARSIP HBO Adegan dari Scenes From A Marriage

Peran jender

Terlepas dari kualitas akting dan penyajian sinematografi yang menarik dan cerdas kisah tentang relasi dan cinta dalam sebuah pernikahan sangatlah dekat dan berkorelasi dengan kehidupan sehari-hari penonton. Menjadi peluang untuk menarik perhatian penonton.

Terlebih Scenes From A Marriage disuguhkan dengan penyesuaian baru dari sisi isu yang dimunculkan. Dalam jumpa pers yang digelar di Venice Film Festival yang menjadi debut pertama Scenes From A Marriage Jessica mengatakan ”Aku benar-benar sangat excited pada serial ini terutama dalam konteks peran jender. Versi aslinya menyuguhkan peran jender pada masa itu tetapi versi baru ini menyuguhkan peran jender di masa kini khususnya dalam hal gaji siapa yang menanggung keluarga apa artinya menjadi seorang ibu relasi perempuan dengan seksualitas kesuburan begitu banyak aspek.”

Soal beberapa adegan yang menuntut keduanya tampil secara intim baik Jessica maupun Isaac sama-sama meletakkannya dalam ranah profesionalisme. Tentu keduanya sudah berbicara secara mendalam tentang hal itu sehingga membuat keduanya sama-sama nyaman. ”Tentu saja level kepercayaan kami berdua sangat tinggi” kata Jessica.

Jessica yang merupakan aktris nominasi Oscar melalui film Zero Dark Thirty dikenal dalam film-filmnya yang berkarakter kuat seperti Miss Sloane (2016) Molly’s Game (2017) dan Ava (2020). Sementara Oscar dikenal antara lain lewat film-filmnya Inside Liewyn Davis (2013) X-Men: Apocalypse (2016) dan Triple Frontier (2019).

Dalam serial aslinya Scenes From A Marriage yang dirilis pada 11 April 1973 pasangan Mira dan Jonathan diperankan Liv Ullman sebagai Marriane dan Erland Josephson sebagai Johan. Scenes From A Marriage ditulis dan disutradarai Ingmar Bergman dengan judul dalam bahasa Swedia Scener ur ett äktenskap. Berkisah tentang Marriane dan Johan yang akhirnya bercerai setelah hubungan keduanya mengalami pasang surut. Setelah bercerai keduanya tetap menjadi sahabat.

Film ini memenangi sejumlah penghargaan seperti nominasi BAFTA dan Golden Globe untuk Liv Ullmann (Best Actress - Drama) serta Golden Globe untuk Best Foreign Language Film. Dengan anggaran 150.000 dollar AS dan dibuat sebagian besar di Fårö Gotlands län di Swedia film ini pertama dirilis sebagai miniseri televisi dengan 6 episode total 295 menit.

Sutradara Hagai Levi menjelaskan inspirasinya saat kembali mengangkat Scenes From A Marriage. Saat menyaksikan Scenes From A Marriage versi lama Hagai sangat terkejut karena saat itu dia masih sangat muda.

”Itu membuat aku menyadari bahwa televisi bisa menjadi sebuah seni. Dan ini menjadi referensi untukku dalam membuat In Treatment. Saat aku didekati oleh putra Ingmar Daniel aku takut sekaligus sangat excited. Tapi aku tahu aku harus memecahkan ketakutanku itu” ujar Hagai.

Selain Jessica dan Isaac Scenes From A Marriage juga menampilkan Sunita Mani Nicole Beharie Corey Stoll dan Tovah Feldshuh.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ib2xhdGltZXMuY29tL2JvbGF0YWlubWVudC8yMDIxLzA5LzExLzA5MzA0NS9jaW50YS1iZXJ0ZXB1ay1zZWJlbGFoLXRhbmdhbi1yb25hbGRvLXBlcm5haC1kaXRvbGFrLTQtd2FuaXRhLWNhbnRpay1pbmnSAYEBaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuYm9sYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9ib2xhdGFpbm1lbnQvMjAyMS8wOS8xMS8wOTMwNDUvY2ludGEtYmVydGVwdWstc2ViZWxhaC10YW5nYW4tcm9uYWxkby1wZXJuYWgtZGl0b2xhay00LXdhbml0YS1jYW50aWstaW5p?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cinta Bertepuk Sebelah Tangan Ronaldo Pernah Ditolak 4 Wanita Cantik Ini,"Bolatimes.com - Cristiano Ronaldo selalu mencuri atensi publik.

(Nobuhiro Watsuki)

Kenshin Himura aka Hitokiri Battosai. Ya siapa yang tidak mengenal samurai dengan katana bermata pedang terbalik itu?

Bagi para penggemar cerita atau pemerhati kisah para samurai Jepang khususnya pada periode Bakumatsu yang menandai berakhirnya kejayaan shogun pada masa dinasti Edo ataupun pada periode awal dinasti Meiji nama Kenshin Himura tentu tidak asing. Ya meski nama tersebut dan sosok yang digambarkan hanya hadir secara fiksi.

Kenshin adalah nama dan sosok dari seorang samurai yang ada pada serial manga Rurouni Kenshin karya Nobuhiro Watsuki yang kemudian diadaptasikan pula ke dalam film animasi maupun film laga dan juga video game. Di Indonesia manga Rurouni Kenshin diterbitkan dengan judul Samurai X.

Toh Watsuki tidaklah menghadirkan Kenshin begitu saja. Sosok Kenshin terinspirasi dari sosok Kawanami Gensai satu dari empat hitokiri terkenal pada periode Bakumatsu. Ketiga lainnya yaitu Kirino Toshiaki aka Nakamura Hanjiro Tanaka Shinbei serta Okada Izo.

Hitokiri dapat disebut sebagai assassin dalam tradisi Jepang seorang pembunuh profesional yang menghabisi orang atau kelompok lain yang biasanya bermotif politik. Kenshin ataupun Kirino Toshiaki--termasuk ketiga hitokiri lainnya--sendiri merupakan penentang kuat keditaktoran shogun yang kemudian mengabdikan diri untuk menghancurkannya bermaksud membawa Jepang kepada era baru yang lebih terbuka.

Restorasi Meiji

Salah satu fase penting dalam sejarah Jepang adalah masa Restorasi Meiji. Masa di mana Jepang mulai membuka diri untuk dunia luar setelah hampir tiga abad lamanya menutup diri rapat-rapat dari dunia luar pada masa Keshogunan Tokugawa (1603-1868).

Fase Restorasi Meiji dimulai dengan naik tahtanya Pangeran Mutsuhito yang kemudian bergelar Kaisar Meiji menggantikan mendiang ayahnya Kaisar Komei menjadi kaisar Jepang ke-122. Nama Restorasi Meiji identik dengan gelar baru Mutsuhito tersebut.

Restorasi Meiji dipicu pada awalnya dengan datangnya Kapal Hitam Angkatan Laut Amerika Serikat di bawah pimpinan Matthew C. Perry pada tahun 1853. Peristiwa yang kemudian membuka mata bangsawan dan masyarakat Jepang akan pesatnya kemajuan teknologi yang selama ini terlewatkan dalam kungkungan politik Sakoku Keshogunan Tokugawa. Hingga kemudian memunculkan Bakumatsu. Di masa inilah para hitokiri banyak memainkan peranannya.

Justin Hawkins is an exception.

“It’s actually one of my favorite topics” said Hawkins region president for Wells Fargo who oversees consumer and small business banking operations for most of South Carolina except the Hilton Head market. “We’ve all been through the pain of watching branches close but I think we’ve done it the right way.”

A newly issued report from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. puts some fresh numbers on the industry’s steady pullback.

The agency's annual accounting of market-share data showed that 28 branches or about 2 percent went dark across South Carolina between mid-2020 and mid-2021 trimming the net balance to 1171 locations.

The most active consolidator during that period was Truist Financial Corp. which this year is taking its cost-cutting axe to about 400 overlapping BB&T and SunTrust locations that it took on when it combined the two regional players in late 2019. In the Palmetto State 17 of the branches were shuttered according to the FDIC report.

First-Citizens of Raleigh was second to Truist with 10 closings followed by Wells Fargo with eight.

South Carolina isn't an outlier. A record 3324 branches were closed nationwide in 2020 or more than three times the number of openings according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.

The pace of the retrenchment has been accelerating. In South Carolina for example banks turned off the lights at 153 branches between 2011 and 2016. But during the past five years closings jumped 76 percent to 270 the FDIC said.

A steady stream of bank buyouts that keeps realigning the business is one of the key culprits as Truist can attest to. The urge-to-merge has whittled the number of lenders that do business in South Carolina to 76 from 116 over the past decade.

Another factor is that customers are more comfortable using ATMs and personal technology to handle routine tasks such as depositing checks through their smartphones. As a result Hawkins said branches are increasingly becoming ""advice centers"" as opposed to their former primary roles as ""transactional centers.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaW50ZXJjZXB0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzA5LzExL3NlcHRlbWJlci0xMS1zYXVkaS1hcmFiaWEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,9/11 and the Saudi Connection,"None of the issues still lingering 20 years after the 9/11 attacks have been as persistent — or as emotionally wrenching for the families of the victims — as the question of whether Saudi Arabia provided funding and other assistance for the worst terrorist attack in American history.

Of the 19 Al Qaeda terrorists who hijacked four U.S. commercial airliners on the morning of September 11 2001 15 were citizens of Saudi Arabia — and of course Osama bin Laden was a member of one of Saudi Arabia’s wealthiest families.

Immediately after the attacks the Bush administration downplayed the Saudi connection and suppressed evidence that might link powerful Saudis to the funding of Islamic extremism and terrorism. The Bush White House didn’t want to upset its relationship with one of the world’s largest oil-producing nations which was also an American ally with enormous political influence in Washington and much of what the FBI discovered about possible Saudi links to the attacks remains secret even today.

“What are they hiding? What is the big secret?” Terry Strada whose husband was killed in the attack on the World Trade Center asked in an interview. “We’ve been operating on lies for 20 years. I’ve always just wanted to know the truth: Who was behind this and how did it happen?”

Many U.S. officials have insisted over the last two decades that the American government is not really hiding any conclusive evidence of Saudi involvement and it is quite possible that successive presidents along with the intelligence community have closed ranks simply to avoid revealing classified information. And it’s plausible that officials want to avoid exposing details that might be politically embarrassing for both Washington and the Saudis yet don’t prove that the Saudi royal family the Saudi government or other powerful Saudi individuals played any role in providing funding or assistance for the September 11 attacks. But the refusal to be open and transparent about such a fundamental issue has fed suspicions.

Two decades later however glimpses of material that have become public provide mounting evidence that senior Saudi officials including one diplomat in the Saudi Embassy in Washington may in fact have indirectly provided assistance for two of the Al Qaeda hijackers Khalid al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi who were the first of the hijackers to arrive in the United States in 2000 and lived for about a year and a half in San Diego beforehand.

The CIA had identified both Mihdhar and Hazmi as Al Qaeda operatives by early 2000 based partly on Mihdhar’s participation in an Al Qaeda meeting in Malaysia and the agency was tracking the pair’s international movements. But the CIA did not pass on that information to officials at the FBI or other domestic agencies at the time and the two plotters were not placed on any watch lists that might have prevented them from entering the United States weeks later. It was not until weeks before the September 11 attacks that the FBI learned that Mihdhar and Hazmi had entered the country and began a belated and unsuccessful search for them even as both men were living openly in San Diego according to multiple government reviews.

While no smoking gun has emerged the evidence indicates that the two hijackers had received logistical and financial support from a handful of people inside the United States with connections to Saudi Arabia including a man in California whose family received tens of thousands of dollars from the wife of the Saudi ambassador to the United States.

The ongoing scrutiny of the Saudis’ role has been driven by a massive lawsuit in federal court in Manhattan brought by families of the victims who maintain that senior Saudi officials were complicit in the attacks. The families were blocked for 15 years from even bringing their claims because of the “sovereign immunity” protection for foreign governments in court. In 2016 Congress overrode a veto by President Barak Obama to clear the way for the lawsuit by approving the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act.

Lawyers for the families have now collected some 11000 still-secret pages of internal documents from the U.S. government and have deposed numerous Saudi witnesses to determine what they knew of the hijackers’ plot bolstering what they say is a trail of connections leading back to Riyadh.

“Our view has always been that there were agents of the Saudi government acting in coordination with one another … to provide a critical support network for the first hijackers” Sean P. Carter one of the lawyers representing the victims’ families said in an interview. “There are a lot of contact points between the bad actors here.”

“Our view has always been that there were agents of the Saudi government acting in coordination with one another … to provide a critical support network for the first hijackers.”

Carter said that a verdict against the Saudis finding them financially liable in the attacks could result in “many billions of dollars” in damages. But he added that bringing out the truth would be just as important. “This is the only vehicle the families have to correct the historical record and achieve some sort of accountability on behalf of their loved ones” he said. “That’s a huge piece of it.”

One of the most explosive pieces of evidence against the Saudis emerged only by accident. It came in a court filing by the Trump administration last year that was intended ironically to support the government’s arguments for keeping the FBI’s Saudi records sealed as state secrets. The Justice Department’s public filing first reported by Yahoo News redacted numerous sections on national security grounds but inadvertently disclosed the name of a former official in the Saudi Embassy in Washington — “Jarrah” — or Mussaed Ahmed al-Jarrah who worked as a senior diplomat until about 2000 under Prince Bandar bin Sultan who was then the long-serving Saudi ambassador to the United States. The document citing a 2012 internal FBI summary indicated that Jarrah was believed to have “tasked” two other Saudi men living in southern California “with assisting the hijackers” in San Diego Mihdhar and Hazmi who spoke little English.

The accidental disclosure reaching inside the Saudi Embassy in Washington could prove critical for the victims’ families in establishing that Saudi Arabia bears some responsibility for the attacks.

There has long been scrutiny on the two Saudi men who helped the hijackers in southern California — Omar al-Bayoumi and Fahad al-Thumairy both of whom have left the United States. Bayoumi a Saudi expatriate who was on the payroll of a Saudi defense contractor befriended the two hijackers in San Diego soon after their arrival in 2000 and worked with them step by step to settle into their new lives. He helped them open bank accounts apply for Social Security cards and driver’s licenses find a place to live in San Diego and even receive flying lessons.

Bayoumi later told the FBI that he had met the two men by chance at a restaurant in Los Angeles and agreed to help them as simple hospitality toward fellow Saudis. But the FBI was skeptical of his account according to documents that have since become public.

The second man Thumairy was a diplomat in the Saudi consulate’s office in Los Angeles at the time. The FBI found extensive phone contacts between Thumairy and Bayoumi and agents suspected that Thumairy also worked to help Mihdhar and Hazmi after their arrival.

Osama Basnan a Saudi living in San Diego may have also played a role with Bayoumi. Basnan’s wife received tens of thousands of dollars in checks from the wife of Prince Bandar the Saudi ambassador to the United States. The Saudis insisted that Bandar’s wife Princess Haifa al-Faisal sent the money as part of a charitable effort to help with medical bills for Basnan’s wife who was ill at the time. But FBI investigators believed that a chunk of the money ended up with Bayoumi.

Other possible connections also led back to Prince Bandar according to a 28-page section of a joint congressional inquiry in 2002 which was kept secret until its partial release in 2016. One intriguing piece of evidence came when an Al Qaeda operative was captured with the unlisted number for a Colorado company that managed Prince Bandar’s estate in Aspen.

The 28 pages kept secret through the Bush administration and most of Obama’s laid out a panoply of other connections between the hijackers and people inside or connected to the Saudi government raising as many questions as they answered. Former Sen. Bob Graham of Florida who was co-chair of the joint congressional review that produced the report had pushed for years for it to be declassified. He said at the time that the release of the partially redacted document “suggests a strong linkage between those terrorists and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Saudi charities and other Saudi stakeholders” and represented “the removal of the cork at the end of the bottle.”

But many thousands of pages of government files on the possible Saudi connections remain bottled up even as families of the victims have pushed in court for greater access to them as part of their lawsuit against the Saudis. And Prince Bandar himself reportedly refused to answer questions from lawyers for the victims’ families as part of the recent depositions of Saudi officials in their lawsuit. For years Saudi Arabia has strenuously rejected charges that its officials had any knowledge of or involvement with the 9/11 terror plot.

The Saudi Embassy in Washington did not return messages seeking comment on the lawsuit or the ongoing questions about the royal kingdom’s possible involvement in the attacks.

Because of Saudi Arabia’s status as a critical Middle East ally successive presidents have walked a diplomatic tightrope with Riyadh for two decades selling billions in arms to the kingdom even in the face of human rights abuses and the ongoing questions about connections to the September 11 attacks. The alliance was tested again three years ago by another brutal act of violence — the killing and dismembering of Jamal Khashoggi a Saudi dissident and Washington Post columnist. While the Trump administration drew wide criticism for failing to take any action over the assassination the Biden administration publicly released an intelligence report earlier this year laying responsibility for the murder directly at the feet of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and issued financial sanctions against some of those Saudi operatives thought to have been involved. But Biden stopped short of taking action against the royal prince himself because of concerns about the damage it might cause to the partnership.

The final report of the 9/11 Commission in 2004 after a 20-month investigation acknowledged that “Saudi Arabia has long been considered the primary source of Al Qaeda funding but we have found no evidence that the Saudi government as an institution or senior Saudi officials individually funded the organization.” Some of the more intriguing financial connections between Saudis and the hijackers were consigned to unexplained footnotes.

But some commissioners now doubt the report’s conclusions about the lack of Saudi involvement. “I don’t think we know all the answers. We got what the FBI had” Jamie Gorelick said in an interview. “There were a number of trails that went dead on us and it has been my assumption that funds from people in Saudi Arabia — not necessarily the government — flowed into the United States to help the hijackers” she added. “They must have had some help a network of support.”

Indeed the possible Saudi connections had generated intense scrutiny from investigators at the 9/11 Commission and debate over the final conclusions. Staffers believed that they had found a close Saudi connection to the hijackers in San Diego but Philip Zelikow the executive director of the commission and Dieter Snell a top aide had doubts and rewrote that section of the final report before it went to the printers removing the most damning material against the Saudis according to “The Commission: The Uncensored History of the 9/11 Commission” a 2008 book by Philip Shenon who covered the commission for the New York Times.

For years after the commission report a team of FBI agents continued pursuing possible connections between the Saudis and the hijackers and built more evidence but the Justice Department closed down the investigation without charges. In 2015 a federal commission revisited the 9/11 Commission’s recommendations and findings but on the question of complicity by the Saudis or anyone else it arrived at the same place — even in light of potentially significant new material gathered by the FBI in its investigation. “This new information is not sufficient to change the 9/11 Commission’s original findings regarding the presence of witting assistance to al-Hazmi and al-Mihdhar” the review concluded.

Most of the FBI files on the possible links still remain secret even though the investigation has been closed. The Justice Department told the judges hearing the families’ lawsuit in August that the FBI would review the classified documents to determine what additional files could be disclosed publicly and Biden signed an executive order last week formally authorizing that review process. But some victims’ family members say they are not optimistic that the review will produce much of value after fighting for 20 years — through four different presidential administrations — to find out what role Saudi officials might have played in the 9/11 plot. Some 1700 survivors have been so upset by the ongoing blockage of the internal information in the case that they signed a letter to Biden last month asking him not to attend memorial events this week commemorating the anniversary.

“I want to know why the Department of Justice is protecting the Saudi kingdom.”

The possible Saudi connection overlaps with another lingering mystery from 9/11: How was it that even with the system “blinking red” at the CIA over intelligence indicating a possible attack the CIA failed to communicate with the FBI about what it had learned about the Malaysia meeting and the fact that two of the would-be hijackers were in the United States?

The explanation that communication failures and turf issues between the CIA and the FBI were to blame has never satisfied former intelligence officials like Daniel J. Jones who led the six-year Senate intelligence staff investigation in the aftermath of 9/11 into the CIA’s use of torture against Al Qaeda detainees.

“It has never made sense to me how the CIA requested surveillance of the meeting in Malaysia — this is after the embassy bombings and when there was a belief another attack was coming — yet nobody at the CIA officially relayed this information to the FBI even after the CIA tracked two of the operatives to Los Angeles” he told The Intercept.

Richard A. Clarke counterterrorism director at the National Security Council in both the Clinton and Bush White Houses has theorized that one explanation may come from Saudi Arabia: With the CIA prevented from conducting intelligence operations on U.S. soil it might have turned to a friendly foreign intelligence service — the Saudis — to track the movements of the two San Diego hijackers using Bayoumi a suspected Saudi spy.

“Nothing in the joint congressional investigation the 9/11 Commission’s work or the CIA Inspector General’s investigation explains why the CIA hid its knowledge about these two al-Qaeda operatives” Clarke wrote after the partial release of the 28 pages on the Saudis’ possible involvement in 2016.

But a “false flag operation that went wrong” just might explain it Clarke said. By this theory the CIA — rather than going to the FBI for help — might have gotten the Saudi intelligence to have Bayoumi ingratiate himself with the two would-be hijackers in Southern California in 2000 and track their movements to determine why they had come to America. And in the aftermath of 9/11 the CIA and the Saudis “would have good reason to hide it” he said.

The lingering questions beg for answers families of 9/11 victims say.

Kristen Breitweiser whose husband was killed in the attacks said in an interview that the families are fighting not just the Saudis but their own government which she said appears more intent on protecting an important foreign ally than aiding the victims’ families.

“We’re fed up. We want accountability and transparency” Breitweiser said. “I want to know why the Department of Justice is protecting the Saudi kingdom. I’m being robbed of justice for the murder of my husband. It’s just a cover-up I’m sorry to say.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlucXVpcmVyLmNvbS9waGlsbGllcy9waGlsbGllcy1hYXJvbi1ub2xhLXJvY2tpZXMtdHdvLXN0cmlrZS1ob21lcnMtanQtcmVhbG11dG8tMjAyMTA5MTIuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Aaron Nola Phillies pitchers struggling in two-strike counts,"Aaron Nola flicked two curveballs past the bat of Garrett Hampson on Sunday afternoon to jump ahead with an 0-2 count in the fifth inning. A batter earlier Bryce Harper allowed a routine flyout to become a single when he lost the ball in the sun.

But Nola a strike away from facing the pitcher’s spot with two outs seemed unfazed. And then he threw his third curveball missed his spot and hung it over the plate. This time Hampson didn’t miss.

“I should’ve tried to throw it 50 feet” Nola said. “It was a curveball down the middle.”

It was Nola’s third home run allowed this season with an 0-2 count and his 12th with two strikes. The Phillies staff leads the majors with 16 homers in an 0-2 count as Hampson hit another 0-2 homer in the seventh off Héctor Neris. Nola is tied for the National League lead for homers allowed with two strikes.

The Rockies hit five 0-2 homers in the four game series after having hit just three all season.

“We’re not executing our pitches when it comes to 0-2 counts” catcher J.T. Realmuto said. “We have the least amount of wasted pitches 0-2 which means we’re throwing more pitches in the strike zone 0-2 than anyone in baseball. With today’s hitters there’s a lot of chase in the game so you don’t always want guys chasing the strikeout for two or three pitches in a row but 0-2 is a good time to do it. I think our guys have the right intent obviously they’re not trying to throw the ball in the middle of the plate in an 0-2 count but we’re not doing a very good job of executing.”

The Phillies according to Statcast have thrown the most 0-2 pitches in the strike zone. Manager Joe Girardi and Realmuto both pointed to that being a result of failed execution by the pitchers as it’s not the team’s gameplan to have 0-2 pitches grooved for homers.

“It’s more about location than necessarily the pitch” Realmuto said. “Just about every hitter in baseball chases a fastball and a breaking ball. There’s a certain location you can go to get the chase. So it’s necessarily the pitch selection it’s where we’re throwing it and being able to execute the location specifically with fastballs.”

Nola has built his career on accuracy so it’s been concerning this season to see that slip when he’s ahead in the count. He said he simply could have thrown a ball to Hampson and still had a two-strike count. Instead his signature curveball fell flat. For the Phillies it was just more trouble with two strikes.

“He’s a guy who especially when he throws his curveball with two strikes and gets it into the right location it’s almost a swing and miss every time. We’ve seen that from him for a long time” Realmuto said. “I’m not sure if it’s something mechanical or what but when he’s right and able to locate his pitches with two strikes he’s borderline unhittable. We just have to hone in those counts because he’s one of the best in baseball in getting guys with two strikes. Most of the hits and most of the damage that he’s given up this year has been late in counts and just missing location with two strikes. When he’s right you’ve seen how many guys he strikes out and how tough he is to score on.”

His mother Nicole Mitchell is a preschool teacher one of the most important but overlooked (and overworked and underpaid and ... we’ll save that column for another day) jobs in America.

It is a job that far too often requires teachers to not only sacrifice their time beyond official school hours but also provide supplies for their classrooms.

This has been an ongoing issue for educators across the country for decades particularly in underserved and often underfunded communities.

And with the global pandemic of 2020 (and beyond unfortunately) that only exacerbated the problem.

The Mitchells wanted to help and found a willing partner in Clorox.

During this back-to-school season Donovan is helping Clorox celebrate teachers through the brand’s $1 million donation to DonorsChoose which will help get funds to teachers so they can clear their supply wish lists for classrooms this year.

Clorox conducted a nationwide survey among 1000 U.S. educators. Here’s what they found.

Nearly half (46 percent) of the teachers surveyed said they spent more of their personal funds in the past year because of the pandemic.

Of those surveyed 61 percent feel their students miss out on learning because they don’t have the supplies they need.

On average teachers spend more than $500 out of their own pockets to adequately stock their classrooms.

The Utah Jazz All-Star sat down for an exclusive one-on-one interview with EBONY to talk about his partnership with Clorox the role education plays in his life as an NBA star as well as his thoughts on the upcoming NBA season and the new-look (and older) Los Angeles Lakers.

EBONY: What motivated you to get involved with this particular initiative with Clorox?

Donovan Mitchell: I’ve always had A fond appreciation of teachers. They’ve had a major impact in my life; obviously my mom being one of them. But watching her do that (teach preschoolers virtually) and continue to put in the work being up at 1 am being ready for that 8 am class. That to me is what made this a no-brainer.

I’m sure you have memories of going shopping for school supplies as a youth. I would imagine those memories include your mom coming out of her pocket and shopping for supplies for her students as well.

The funniest ones were late Sunday night trips where we would go to Stop-N-Shop ... and then we go to Staples making sure we get there before 9 o’clock. You don’t understand those things at the time but when you look back... that’s why when this opportunity came to not only show appreciation but give back continue to bring awareness we were elated to do this.

What’s your message to young people when it comes to education?

Education takes you farther than anything. Basketball has brought me into situations I’m blessed to be in. I’m blessed to have the life I live to be able to take care of my family. But at the end of the day the ball will run out. Being a celebrity being famous is great. I’m still doing stuff through school as well. It’s not like we just hoopin’ and go to sleep. Everything we do revolves around school. And that’s not just for athletes. That’s for everybody in life.

But being young rich and in the spotlight how do you keep yourself motivated to keep your thirst for education?

As a competitor you always want to be the best. You find ways in basketball. Now I just discovered it in golf. I want to get better in golf. Being able to understand the business of basketball—understanding the business of the life I live if I stepped away from the game I’d be good for life and that’s great. But how do I capitalize on that? How do I [do] more? And how do I do that through basketball off the floor?

What are your thoughts on the new-look Los Angeles Lakers who are a little more seasoned than we’ve seen in past years?

The biggest thing is when the time comes we have to be ready for it—not to say we weren’t [last season] or haven’t been. But just continue to be ready for it. The Lakers have a solid team. Golden State is coming back. You can never count out a Damian Lillard-led team. Luka [Doncic] is...Luka. There are so many different teams. Phoenix is the reigning [Western] Conference champs. Denver has the MVP [Nikola Jokic]and that’s just the West. We have our work cut out for us but so do other teams. We added some great pieces. For us to be the team we want to be we have to continue to put the work in.

BACK TO JAIL FOR MAN WHO SPRAYED SLEEPING CHILD WITH BLEACH SOAKED BEDROOM IN FUEL

An Ormond Beach man is behind bars on child abuse and attempted arson charges after abusing a sleeping 4-year-old spraying him in the face with bleach soaking a bedroom of the home in tiki torch fuel and driving drunk with an infant and toddler unsecured in the car.

Mack Arline 31 (DOB 10/28/1989) was arrested Saturday morning after deputies responded to the home on Avenue E in Ormond Beach on a request from the Daytona Beach Police Department. A Daytona Beach officer had been flagged down by the mother of three children who showed a video clip of Arline pouring fuel around their home and spraying the 4-year-old in the face with Clorox. The woman told the officer that Arline was heavily intoxicated and threatening to burn down the house and kill their children.

When deputies arrived they found Arline backing out of the driveway with two children in the vehicle. An 11-month-old baby wearing only a diaper was lying on Arline’s chest in front of the steering wheel and a 2-year-old child was in the front passenger seat unrestrained. Deputies took the children to safety and detained Arline who smelled of alcohol and was not completely coherent.

Deputies then checked on the 4-year-old still inside the house and found him sleeping on a bedroom floor with a Clorox spray bottle near him. In another bedroom deputies found an empty bottle of tiki torch fuel on the bed which was wet as was the furniture.

On closer review of the video that prompted the well-being check deputies watched Arline kick a plastic toy car into the 4-year-old as he slept then spraying him and telling him to wake up while using profanity and a racial slur. After the toy car hit the child he pulled a blanket over his head to cover his face. A second video showed Arline emptying the bottle of fuel on the bed furniture and carpet of the master bedroom.

Deputies also found a bottle of Grey Goose vodka on the passenger floorboard of the vehicle with the cork on the driver’s floorboard and a plastic cup in the driver’s cup holder that smelled of alcohol.

Arline was intoxicated to the point that he had to be picked up and placed in a patrol car before he was transported to the Volusia County Branch Jail on charges of aggravated child abuse child abuse attempted arson DUI and driving with a suspended or revoked license. A state probation officer who was in the area doing probation checks at the time also advised Arline violated his probation on a previous charge of false imprisonment. Arline was also on inmate release status for fleeing or attempting to elude law enforcement. On Sunday he remained held without bond at the Branch Jail.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMioQFodHRwczovL3d3dy53ZnR2LmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL3ZvbHVzaWEtY291bnR5L21hbi1hcnJlc3RlZC1hZnRlci1zcHJheWluZy1jaGlsZC13aXRoLWJsZWFjaC10aHJlYXRlbmluZy1idXJuLWRvd24taG91c2UtZGVwdXRpZXMtc2F5L05YS1Y0QU5NSEpBWDdISkg2Q0Q3SkhaS1dBL9IBsAFodHRwczovL3d3dy53ZnR2LmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL3ZvbHVzaWEtY291bnR5L21hbi1hcnJlc3RlZC1hZnRlci1zcHJheWluZy1jaGlsZC13aXRoLWJsZWFjaC10aHJlYXRlbmluZy1idXJuLWRvd24taG91c2UtZGVwdXRpZXMtc2F5L05YS1Y0QU5NSEpBWDdISkg2Q0Q3SkhaS1dBLz9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Man arrested after spraying child with bleach threatening to burn down house deputies say,"We’re Sorry!

John D. Sterman teaches at the MIT Sloan School of Management. Speaking to Srijana Mitra Das he discusses climate impacts on supply chains — and mitigations for greater sustainability:A. I direct the MIT System Dynamics Group and am co-director of the MIT Sloan Sustainability Initiative . My main research centres on policy to address climate change Through our interactive climate policy simulation models we work with senior leaders in government business investing philanthropy civil society education and the public at large in the US and worldwide to help people learn for themselves about the harms from climate change and ways to build a more secure and prosperous future.A. We’ve already warmed our world over 1°C above pre-industrial levels. The harms from even that are obvious to all now — these include wildfires  drought crop yield declines sea level rise  more extreme storms and flooding and the migration and conflict these create. All these disrupt supply chains through interruptions to sourcing production transport and destination markets.Consumers can expect higher prices and much more volatility in the availability of products as climate change increasingly disrupts the production of commodities.A. Yes. Banks and other financial institutions will experience greater default on loans and higher risk. The cost of capital will rise slowing investment and economic growth particularly in emerging and developing nations. Financial markets abhor risk and uncertainty — climate change increases both.Service industries like healthcare and tourism will also be affected. IT consulting accounting and other service businesses will be impacted as climate change disrupts supply chains for electronics and threatens telecommunications infrastructure.A. In the short run companies need robust emergency plans to safeguard against extreme weather. These may include alternative sources of supply and strategic inventory accumulation. ‘Just in time’ works well when material and component supplies are steady and reliable — but this is now a brittle system with low resilience to increased risks of supply disruptions.These plans should therefore assume more severe disruptions happening more often and with more weather events hitting at once than actuarial estimates would indicate. Many communities have experienced multiple ‘100-year storms’ in just the last decade — so historical experience is a poor guide to future risk in a rapidly warming world.But the most important immediate action for companies and countries is to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions as quickly as possible — without such cuts global warming will continue threatening our prosperity and security. The world’s poor will not be able to rise out of poverty. Instability will increase and the harm to businesses and people will be profound. There is no time to waste.Furthermore companies that cut their dependence on fossil fuels by investing in efficiency and renewable energy increase their own resilience — they will be less vulnerable to disruptions in energy supply and wild swings in energy prices due to the physical harms from climate change and transition risks as governments impose policies that will raise costs and reduce the availability of coal oil and methane gas.Finally companies must not only work to cut their own emissions and those of their supply chain partners they must demand that governments enact policies to phase out fossil fuels as swiftly as possible and promote renewable energy.To succeed in a warming world  businesses need reliable renewable responsible sources of zero-carbon energy. Government policy is essential in providing this infrastructure that will reduce business risk and uncertainty fostering sustainable development and a healthy business sector.A. Apple Amazon Microsoft Walmart General Motors and many other global leaders in business have committed to achieve net zero emissions by midcentury or even sooner.The real estate industry has discovered that highly efficient green buildings have lower operating costs — these cost only 0-5% more than conventional buildings are more comfortable boost worker productivity and are more resilient to climate-fuelled storms. That’s why green buildings rent and sell at premia compared to traditional buildings.A.

I feel proud of the fact that the college has retained the top spot this year as well: Kamna Pathak

For the fifth year in a row DU’s Miranda House retained the top spot in National Institutional Ranking Framework’s (NIRF) rankings in the college category released on Thursday followed by Lady Shri Ram College for Women and Loyola College in Chennai. The rankings are given on the basis of five parameters – teaching learning and resources research and professional practices graduation outcomes outreach and inclusivity and perception.Principal alumnae students and staff of the top-ranking college are elated about another win and share what makes the college so special.For Minissha Lamba who pursued English (Hons) from the college the college’s extraordinary professors make it special and she is grateful for to them for making her who she is today. “I think it’s the extraordinary professors that we have at MH that are shaping new generations. Being in the classroom changed me from a sheltered school girl to a young adult. Our professors encouraged us to ask questions to ask more from ourselves and to not follow the norm but to create our own rules.”Shilpa Shukla who pursued Sociology (Hons) from the college says that MH is more than a college to her. “It’s the whole vibe and energy of that historically charged-up space which makes it unbeatable. The teacher-student relationship is something that I cherish the most. They are not just open-minded but also open-hearted. Also the sense of competition is a healthy one. The college allows you to find who you are and that’s the best gift one can receive” she explains.Bijayalaxmi Nanda Principal Miranda House (MH) shares that the rankings are the result of the hard work put in by students teachers and non-teaching staff over a period of time. She says “This is not something that happens over a day it happens over a period of time. It’s been a legacy ever since its inception. We have been consistent in trying to improve on our work whether it is teaching learning or research. We have also been focussing a lot on collaboration. The period of COVID has taught us that we need to be compassionate and therefore a huge focus on compassion has been there and teachers and students have been looking at how accessible we can be. It is still a work in progress but this is one of the strengths of MH.”She adds “We are humbled by this recognition. This is the recognition of the hard persistent work that has been put in by teachers students and the non-teaching staff. We are learning together so I would say it’s not about being the number one college but recognising what these parameters mean to us and how important it is for us.”Kamna Pathak who pursued Hindi (Hons) from the college says “The best part about MH is its teachers and the relationship they have with their students. When I was in MH I saw that it was a very friendly atmosphere. The students studying in the college are definitely known for their strong academics but the college also gives you the freedom to not just talk about your subjects but your life as well. As a Mirandian I feel proud that the college has retained its top spot. But we also had the freedom to talk to our teachers about our problems too. Pratibha Jolly was the principal when I was in college and I think the freedom that we had with our teachers was very important.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ibmEuYmgvZW4vU0VBSXRhbGlhblRlY2huaXBFbmVyZ2llc3NpZ25jb29wZXJhdGlvbmFncmVlbWVudC5hc3B4P2Ntcz1xOEZtRkpnaXNjTDJmd0l6T04xJTJCRGxoTG9nRmVGbCUyQmZrMDJ5VGRPNXdMQSUzRNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SEA Italian Technip Energies sign cooperation agreement,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.bna.bh/en/SEAItalianTechnipEnergiessigncooperationagreement.aspx?cms=q8FmFJgiscL2fwIzON1%2BDlhLogFeFl%2Bfk02yTdO5wLA%3D on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ibmEuYmgvZW4vU0VBSXRhbGlhblRlY2huaXBFbmVyZ2llc3NpZ25jb29wZXJhdGlvbmFncmVlbWVudC5hc3B4P2Ntcz1xOEZtRkpnaXNjTDJmd0l6T04xJTJCRGxoTG9nRmVGbCUyQmZrMDJ5VGRPNXdMQSUzRNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsL2J1c2luZXNzL3NhdWRpLWFyYW1jby1zcGxpdHMtaXRzLWdhcy1iaXotYW1pZC1jaGVtLWV4cGFuc2lvbi9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy84NjEyMTM1NC5jbXPSAYgBaHR0cHM6Ly9tLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuY29tL25ld3MvaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC9idXNpbmVzcy9zYXVkaS1hcmFtY28tc3BsaXRzLWl0cy1nYXMtYml6LWFtaWQtY2hlbS1leHBhbnNpb24vYW1wX2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzg2MTIxMzU0LmNtcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Saudi Aramco splits its gas business amid expansion in chemicals,"

Saudi Arabia's state-run energy firm is splitting its gas production division in two as the fuel becomes increasingly important for expanding its chemicals business and amid efforts to position itself for the energy transition. Saudi Arabian Oil Co will create two new divisions named Southern Area Gas Operations and Northern Area Gas Operations  according to people familiar with the matter. The departments will be run by Wail Al Jaafari and Jumaan Al Zahrani respectively according to the people who asked not to be identified. The appointments are awaiting board approval.Aramco didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.Gas is becoming increasingly important to Saudi Arabia the world’s largest oil exporter as it expands its chemicals business which uses the fuel for feedstock. The country is also looking to convert its power plants to gas-fired ones which could free as much as 1 million barrels a day of crude for export. The kingdom is trying to position itself for the energy transition by becoming a supplier of blue hydrogen which is made from gas. The carbon emitted during the process would then be captured.Aramco reached record gas production of 10.7 billion standard cubic feet (300 million cubic meters) a day in August last year according to its 2020 annual report.The company's gas division consists of 11 processing centers with a total capacity of 16 billion standard cubic feet a day of raw gas. Output had previously been managed through one division under vice president Abdullah Al-Ghamdi who retired according to Aramco’s weekly magazine.Al Jaafari and Al Zahrani will report directly to Nasir Al Naimi a senior vice president overseeing all of Aramco’s upstream businesses one of the people said. The new reporting structure will mirror the company's crude departments which were already divided into Southern and Northern areas.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinwFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvZW5lcmd5L29pbC1nYXMvcGV0cm9uZXQtZXllcy1mcmVzaC1mb3JheS1pbnRvLXBldGNoZW0tYml6LXBsYW5zLWxuZy1pbXBvcnQtZmFjaWxpdHktb24tZWFzdC1jb2FzdC9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy84NjEzNTEyMy5jbXPSAaMBaHR0cHM6Ly9tLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuY29tL2luZHVzdHJ5L2VuZXJneS9vaWwtZ2FzL3BldHJvbmV0LWV5ZXMtZnJlc2gtZm9yYXktaW50by1wZXRjaGVtLWJpei1wbGFucy1sbmctaW1wb3J0LWZhY2lsaXR5LW9uLWVhc3QtY29hc3QvYW1wX2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzg2MTM1MTIzLmNtcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Petronet eyes fresh foray into petchem business; plans LNG import facility on east coast,"Find this comment offensive?

To celebrate the nationwide availability of Coca-Cola Sip Sized bottles made from 100% recycled plastic material (rPET) not including the bottles’ cap and label the companies are offering more than 40000 free bike or e-scooter rides to people who purchase and pledge to recycle their 13.2oz 100% rPET* Coca-Cola bottles.

“The 13.2oz 100% rPET* Coca-Cola bottle is just one of the many innovations the company has introduced to make important advancements towards a World Without Waste” said Brandan Strickland Brand Director of Coca-Cola Trademark Coca-Cola North America. “Now with 13.2oz 100% rPET* Coca-Cola bottles available at convenience stores across the nation we’re encouraging people to go the extra mile to commit to recycling our products again and again.”

According to a release the Lime partnership comes as consumer demand for micromobility has skyrocketed specifically among Gen Z who expect their use of alternative modes of transit to increase in the future compared to pre-pandemic transportation. That’s why Coca-Cola is partnering with Lime to make zero-emission modes of transportation more accessible to those hoping to reduce their impact on the environment.

“With sustainability so central to Lime’s core values we’re thrilled to partner with Coca-Cola to encourage recycling of its new bottle made from 100% recycled materials*” said Sara Lannin Head of Global Business Development and Partnerships at Lime. “Contributing to a healthier planet requires us all to live more sustainably whether doing more to recycle or replacing car trips with light electric vehicles.”

Individuals who purchase the Sip Sized Coca-Cola bottle from their nearest convenience store can pledge to recycle by visiting CokePlayToWin.com/endlesslyrefreshing. Those who pledge to recycle their Sip Sized 100% rPET* Coca-Cola bottles will receive a promo code via email – available on a first come first serve basis – redeemable for a free 10-minute bike or e-scooter ride through the Lime app.

This initiative along with transition to the 100% rPET* packaging across the Coca-Cola trademark portfolio reduces The Coca-Cola Company’s use of new plastic by more than 20% across the portfolio in North America compared to 2018 and using internal company tools and analyses it is estimated that this effort in the United States represents a 10000 metric ton reduction in GHG emissions annually. This is the equivalent of taking 2120 cars off the road for one year.

Special to The Desert Sun

Baseball apple pie and Coca-Cola: three great icons of American culture. With apologies to apple pie rampant merchandising has long come to characterize baseball and Coca-Cola. Both were 19th century inventions and today both are celebrated around the world. Nonetheless Coca-Cola has produced a veritable fountain of antiques and collectibles since its inception dwarfing even the impressive world of baseball memorabilia. What is it about this soda pop that generates so much passion among collectors? First some history.

While Abner Doubleday usually gets the nod for inventing baseball in the 1830s a pharmacist named John Pemberton came up with the recipe for Coke syrup in 1886. He convinced a nearby soda fountain in Atlanta to add carbonated water and give it a try. At first the drink was a modest success but soon the name Coca-Cola came into being scripted in a flowing hand by Pemberton's partner Frank Robertson. That plus a series of hand-painted banners exhorting passers-by to ""Drink Coca-Cola"" was the beginning of a juggernaut that helped define modern marketing techniques.

Pemberton would live only two more years after introducing his innovative drink and could never have foreseen its worldwide potential. Coca-Cola today is a diverse multi-billion-dollar company still based in Atlanta its distinctive trademark virtually unchanged from the original. Worldwide it spends about four billion dollars per year on marketing a billion or so of which is used to promote its products in the USA. And with 135 years of Coca-Cola products to seek out collectors of Coke merchandise are among the most passionate of any category.

On eBay alone there are currently more than 216000 Coca-Cola collectibles for sale ranging from original 6.5-ounce glass bottles for 99 cents apiece to lifetime assortments well into six figures. Restored and working vending machines can run $10000 or more while the rather odd category of factory error cans can cost almost as much. Early porcelain signs and those with original neon enhancements frequently sell for thousands as well. Because of the huge variety of merchandise many collectors tend to specialize by era type or size. If you have the room you might consider a 121 die-cut Coke bottle currently available online for a cool and refreshing $3700.

According to the Guinness Book of World Records the world's largest private collection of Coke memorabilia is ostensibly owned by a lady in North Carolina with more than 2000 items. However many longtime Coke bottlers have amassed their own collections including one in Kentucky that grew to more than 80000 objects prior to its disposition about 10 years ago. That collection featured some of the earliest artifacts known all housed in a 32000-square-foot museum. Its sale generated more than $10 million.

All this is to say that if you are a Coca-Cola collector you are not alone. Coke items can be found anywhere at virtually any price point. Keep in mind though that reproductions are legion in this category so knowledge is power as you advance in your collecting. Many price guides and online forums are available to learn from and they can help keep you from making expensive mistakes. Whatever your approach it's a fun and lively category that can quickly grow into a passion.

Last week the Spirit’s game against the Portland Thorns was postponed due to a COVID-19 outbreak of cases among the Spirit. Details regarding the rescheduling of the game have yet to be announced.

It seemed like a small thing stopping for a yellow light. But it may have made all the difference for Jane Rosenthal on the morning of Sept. 11 2001. Her car was a block and half away from the Twin Towers when the first plane hit. The CEO of Tribeca Enterprises was heading to work but managed to turn back and uptown. “I was wearing shoes that you couldn’t run in heels. It’s the last time I have worn shoes and not carried sneakers with me. I’m always cognizant that you might need to run.”

Around 30th Street on the East Side she said “I stood in line at a pay phone. It was the last time I stood in line at a pay phone and used a pay phone.”

There was no cell signal recalled Jeff Sine co-founder and partner of merchant bank Raine Group who had just been recruited to head technology media and telecom banking at UBS. He was at breakfast with a friend in midtown and when he walked outside “The world had changed” he said. He managed to connected with a colleague. Her husband was a police detective and Sine spent days with him and a few other cops on support runs – “driving around to places to pick up whatever the emergency workers needed” from fresh fruit to ice to sweatpants.

He recalled the massive Chelsea Piers complex at 23rd Street and the Hudson River as a staging area for donations full to bursting and its ice ring turned makeshift morgue and triage area grimly empty. That was one horror of the 9/11 attacks there weren’t as many bodies or wounded to tend to as one would have thought – people either got out of the burning towers or in time or they didn’t.

Joe Amodei CEO of Virgil Films worked at USA Films then and was at the Toronto Film Festival like many in the indie community when the towers fell. He cried when he first saw the smoking hulks in lower Manhattan after finally managing to return to New York by train days later. USA embraced an idea to donate 100 movies and a new video recorder to every firehouse in every borough. The studios all cooperated. “On Nov. 11 we delivered to 162 firehouses” he said. “The very last station was on 8th Ave. around 52nd. Normally the firemen would gather around. This was different. The man that answered the door said ‘We lost the entire house.’”

Tribeca Film Festival

That month Rosenthal and her partner Robert De Niro decided to plan a film festival to help the still smoky and acrid smelling neighborhood where everyone was shell-shocked and no one wanted to come. “It was really dark. You didn’t know what you were breathing” she said. “Bob and I had talked about doing a film festival before… I called him and said ‘We need to bring people back downtown.’ We announced it a week later.”

In the spring of 2001 she had worked producing About a Boy. “So I knew that for the first film I could have About a Boy. I knew I had a film. I had no clue about [other] films and activations and [were] we a competitive festival. It was about bringing people back downtown. If I could bring 100000 people all would be right in the world. I was obsessed with it. Bob was obsessed with it. To bring everyone together to give people a sense of hope something to look forward to.”

She said would not have believed then if “you would have said to me that 20 years later I’d still be talking about our impact on our community and having the bookends that we have had” with Covid.

What emerged from 9/11 is so complicated. The human toll the financial toll the destruction and rebirth of a swathe of the city. Families and first responders who worked without masks or other protections suffered lasting consequences. But Sept. 11 was geographically contained the economic recovery relatively rapid and successful. Banks that had dominated the financial district made room for apartment buildings and cafes accelerating a transformation of the area to more residential and a hub for media technology and the arts from Conde Nast to Spotify to the upcoming Ronald O. Perelman Performing Arts Center.

The boom was captured in a report from the New York State Comptroller dated 2016 but still widely quoted showing the population of lower Manhattan more than doubled from 22700 in 2000 to 49000 in 2014. The number of residential housing units also doubled as did the number of small businesses like dry cleaners. The financial sector accounted for more than half the jobs in the area in 2000 but fell to a third in 2015. Banks sent chunks of their business elsewhere in part to create “redundancies” when it became a mandatory best-practice after 9/11 for all kids of organizations to have data centers in geographically dispersed locations.

The so-called War On Terror launched with a milestone last month as U.S. troops finally left Afghanistan after 20 years. Airport security tightened with long lines 3 oz. bottles belt and shoe checks. There was a strong sense of national unity but also stereotyping of Arabs and Arab Americans and the rise of 9/11 conspiracy theories that today feel like an early echo of QAnon. (Spike Lee just excised a portion of the final chapter of his NYC Epicenters 9/11- 2021½ docuseries on HBO that features interviews with individuals and groups that believe the Twin Towers were brought down via a controlled explosion as part of a broader conspiracy.)

The imagery of 9/11 towers collapsing dust-covered crowds fleeing firefighters rushing in and up the towers first responders toiling atop a monumental pile of rubble and twisted metal in heat and smoke are stamped on the national psyche and still powerful — one difference from the current crisis. “There are some images that will become be emblematic of Covid but they’re mostly emergency rooms and people on ventilators” said Ed Arentz a founder and co-president of Greenwich Entertainment. In 2001 he was a founding partner of newly formed film distributor Empire Pictures and programmer for the Cinema Village movie theater.

His office was on the 78th floor of the Empire State Building. “That became a huge deal because it was seen as a potential secondary target so the security getting in was quite elaborate and time consuming.”

“We stayed away for a little while but virtual work was not as easy as it is today” he said.

Cinema Village was open but attendance “non-existent.” (The New York Stock Exchange did close for four days its longest shutdown since 1933. Broadway suspended performances for two days but played to largely empty houses for a time.)

“It was our first remote scenario” said Tom Bernard co-founder and co-president of Sony Pictures Entertainment. “The second was the Sony hack [a massive 2014 data leak by a group identifying itself as Guardians of Peace]. The third was Covid.”

Arentz and Bernard were also in Toronto on 9/11 but managed to finds cars and get home relatively quickly. Bernard said Canadian hockey gear he had in the back seat helped with guards in crossing the border.

NYC Recovery

The very ease of remote work now is fueling worries about NYC’s recovery. The population that had built up in lower Manhattan along with residents from across the city have scattered over the last 18 months. Luring them back is crucial. There the bustle the tax revenue and the need to support a massive ecosystem of services and small businesses that depend on offices which have been slow to reopen — delayed most recently by a wave of the fast-spreading Delta Variant.

At one point over the summer before Delta took hold recovery seemed in reach. But Covid is a much longer slog than anyone imagined and the outcome for the city still uncertain.

“My hope is we are going to get through this as an industry. Things were opening back up” said Amodei. However “I don’t know if I feel the same way today [as I did then] that the city will ever be back to normal after Covid.”

“I am worried about New York” Rosenthal said. But more worrisome is that “what goes on in New York and our political system and all of our major institutions that we believe in for our democracy are being questioned in a lot of ways. I fear more for that than I do about the virus. The virus will be science and medicine.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJjaGVpZ2h0cy5jb20vMjAyMS8wOS8xMi9zaG9ydGVuLXRoZS1saW5lcy1iYy1kaW5pbmctc2hvdWxkLWltcGxlbWVudC1hLXN3aXBlLXN5c3RlbS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Shorten The Lines: BC Dining Should Implement a Swipe System — The Heights,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.bcheights.com', port=443): Read timed out.

Horror flick “Halloween Kills” will stream on Comcast Corp’s Peacock streaming service next month starting on the same day it debuts in movie theaters distributor Universal Pictures said in a statement on Thursday.

The strategy is a shift from Comcast’s earlier plan to send the film exclusively to theaters beginning Oct. 15. Hollywood studios have been experimenting with release patterns as cinemas work to recover from COVID-19 closures and media companies try to boost interest in their streaming offerings.

Cinema operators including AMC Entertainment Cineworld Plc and Cinemark Holdings Inc say the streaming option eats into their business and have urged studios to stick with theater-only debuts.

“Halloween Kills” stars Jamie Lee Curtis in a follow-up to the 2018 revival of the classic horror franchise. People who want to stream the new movie at home will need a subscription to the $5-a-month Peacock Premium or to Peacock Premium Plus which costs $10 per month. The film will not be available on the free version of Peacock.

Universal employed the same strategy for “The Boss Baby” animated family sequel in July. That movie generated $105.8 million in global box office sales and Comcast executives said it also helped boost subscribers to Peacock.

For theaters the Delta variant of COVID-19 has slowed a hoped-for comeback in moviegoing. Upcoming films scheduled for this year include James Bond movie “No Time to Die” sci-fi epic “Dune” and Marvel movie “Eternals.”

Some movies including Tom Cruise’s “Top Gun: Maverick” have been delayed until next year."

The Tampa Bay Rays scored first and never looked back.

According to a social media post Kanigowski along with members of the Roseville Fire Department participated in the team’s ceremony honoring the victims of the 9/11 attacks.

“Chief Kanigowski was asked the throw out the first pitch” the Roseville Fire Fighters Union Local 1614 said in a Facebook post.

The department posted photos on Facebook that seem to show Kanigowski throwing the ball “right down the middle” as the announcers say.

It wasn’t clear who selected Kanigowski for the pitch. He couldn’t be reached for comment Sunday and other firefighters said they were not aware of the circumstances surrounding the honor.

Kanigowski is a 24-year veteran of the fire service industry. He recently entered his one year anniversary as top administrator of the department which includes stations on Frazho Road east of Gratiot Avenue and Common Road west of Gratiot.

According to Major League Baseball all 30 teams planned to continue baseball’s tradition of honoring those whose lives were affected or lost on September 11 2001 and pay tribute to the men and women who continue to bravely serve our communities and country 20 years after the tragic events of that day.

Home clubs could recognize the day with solemn ceremonies which may include a moment of silence and a special PSA provided by the National September 11 Memorial & Museum to be played in ballparks the league said on its website.

And while Eastern Market was closed for tailgating due to staffing issues it didn't stop the fans from setting up shop elsewhere to party.

In a parking lot off Gratiot Avenue and the corner of Vernor Highway upwards of 100 people came out to celebrate the Lions' opening day. Cars tents and RVs filled the lot with barbecue grills going and alcoholic beverages circulating.

One attendee Detroit native James Criswell 50 said normally he tailgates at the Eastern Market but the change in locations did not change the atmosphere of his party.

""The energy is super crazy"" said Criswell. ""Everybody is so happy to be coming off of COVID they don't know what to do.""

Sunday was the first game of the season for the Detroit Lions against thefive-time champion San Francisco 49ers. The Detroit Tigers also played against the Tampa Bay Rays at Comerica Park but the Lions game was the first in which Detroit football fans could go out and tailgate in a somewhat normal way since COVID-19 first arrived. And the fans were all for it.

""I've had people calling me all week asking me where we were going to tailgate since Eastern Market was closed"" said Criswell. ""Everyone is coming out just to be a part of the festivities.""

In the surrounding areas cars lined the streets. Barricades were set to block traffic from entering roads too close to Comerica Park and Ford Field and of course the parking lots were jam-packed.

The Lions VIP Tailgate party hosted by the Bullseye Event Group took place at the former Punch Bowl Social Detroit space about a block over from the Z Alley where the CEO said there were about 500 people in attendance.

""The vibe was just incredible"" said Kyle Kinnett. ""The atmosphere the energy the food it was all incredible.""

The Detroit Rolling Pub carried a group of Lions fans through the downtown area too. And over in front of Comerica Park a group of people set up another tailgate party under a tent. Lawn chairs coolers and laughter could be heard as fans walked past.

But a little before 1 p.m. the streets began to clear swiftly as fans began making their way for the start of the game. And at 1:05 p.m. the San Francisco 49ers kicked off the first ball of the season.

“We all wanted to see this moment” Wendle said about Enns. “He hasn’t always had the best luck but he keeps going out there and he was electric tonight. We’re thrilled for him.”

Kevin Kiermaier doubled and tripled to help the Rays end a two-game losing streak.

“This was a really good performance across the board” Rays manager Kevin Cash said. “Joey crushed two balls — he would have had two homers in a lot of parks. KK picked up some extra bases we drove guys in and we pitched well.”

Detroit’s Miguel Cabrera picked up his 2974th career hit with an RBI single in the fourth.

Enns (1-0) struck out six in four hitless innings of relief nine years after being drafted by the New York Yankees out of Central Michigan University.

“That beer shower was really special” he said. “It made it even better to do it in Detroit. I didn’t go to school far from here so my parents and some of my college teammates got to see it.”

Rays starter Chris Archer gave up one run on two hits before leaving after four innings with left hip discomfort.

“It’s something he’s dealt with all year” Cash said. “It comes and goes. Tonight he said after the fourth that it was bothering him. We’ll get him worked on by the trainers.”

Detroit’s Casey Mize (7-8) who is on a pitch limit allowed three runs in two innings.

Wendle tripled with one out in the second. Mike Zunino followed with a grounder to third and Wendle beat Jeimer Candelario’s throw to the plate.

“[Wendle] ran inside the basepath which is exactly what aggressive runners are taught to do and he forced Jeimer to alter the throw” Tigers manager A.J. Hinch said. “We challenged the call because he looked out with the naked eye but they got it right.”

Kiermaier followed with his second triple in as many games giving the Rays a 2-0 lead.

After a walk Brandon Lowe made it 3-0 with a sacrifice fly.

“I felt like they took control of the game right there and we really never got back into it” Hinch said. “We could have two out with a runner on first but they end up with three runs.”

Wendle led off the fourth with a home run and Lowe made it 5-0 with an RBI single later in the inning.

“We did a lot of good things offensively tonight” Wendle said. “This was a nice win after a couple tough games.”

Jonathan Schoop led off the bottom of the inning with a double — Detroit’s first hit — and scored on Cabrera’s line single to right but Randy Azorarena’s sacrifice fly restored Tampa Bay’s five-run lead in the fifth.

After enduring a 10-4 loss to the Tigers on Friday night the Tampa Bay Rays came hungry Saturday and put a 7-2 beating on the Tigers at Comerica Park.

""The story of the night is they just took control of the game"" Tigers manager AJ Hinch said. ""It never felt we were back in the game after the three-spot in the second inning. They took control and could do whatever they needed.""

BOX SCORE: Rays 7 Tigers 2

The Rays jumped on rookie Casey Mize for three runs in that second inning. Joey Wendle and Kevin Kiermaier both tripled and scored in the inning. Wendle homered in the fourth off reliever Bryan Garcia. Kiermaier also doubled and scored in the fourth.

The Rays played a brand of aggressive baseball that Hinch is trying to instill in Detroit and that manifested itself in that quick three-run punch.

Wendle tripled with one out and got an aggressive secondary lead off third base. He broke for home on Mike Zunino's ground ball to third baseman Jeimer Candelario by Mike Zunino. The Tigers infield was in but Wendle was able to slide around the tag of catcher Eric Haase.

""Wendle ran inside the baseline which is exactly how you are taught and how the good teams do it"" Hinch said. ""It looked like the throw was toward the inside and Haase making a sweep tag he was able to get around it.""

Hinch challenged the call at the plate but it was upheld.

""That play from an out and a runner at first to a run in and a runner on first and then the subsequent triple (by Kiermaier) that was just a big punch for them to throw at the beginning of the game"" Hinch said. ""They just keep coming at you.""

Rays manager Kevin Cash deployed a four-outfielder alignment against Robbie Grossman and Haase in the game something else Hinch has done this season.

Mize who wasn’t going to pitch more than three innings lasted only two. In his previous limited-innings start he needed 34 pitches to get through three perfect innings. This time he needed 35 pitches to get through the second inning alone.

Not much was going on offensively for the Tigers. Veteran Chris Archer in his fourth start back from the injured list (elbow) didn’t give up a hit until Jonathan Schoop led off the fourth with a double. He scored on a one-out single by Miguel Cabrera.

Grossman hit his 23rd home run of the season in the ninth.

""Archer is creative he never throws the same pitch twice"" Hinch said. ""He's evolved as a pitcher. You can go up there and try to hunt strikes and if you get some you have a chance. But if you wait around then you get into bad counts and he gets you to chase.""

Archer was pulled after four innings because of discomfort in his left hamstring. But unlike Friday when they scored nine runs off the Rays’ bullpen in the final three innings — something that the Rays hadn’t experienced since 2018 — the Tigers went empty.

Lefty Dietrich Enns a product of Central Michigan University pitched four scoreless and hitless innings to earn his first big-league win. The only runner reached on an error. Using only two pitches — a mid-90s four-seam fastball and a mid-80s cutter — he struck out six and got 11 misses on 35 swings.

""That was a very special beer shower"" Enns told reporters via Zoom after the game. ""There might have been some other stuff in there but I just know there was a lot of cold beer. It's great to finally get this.""

Enns was drafted out of Central by the Yankees in 2012. He pitched nine seasons in the minors with one brief call-up by the Twins in 2017.

""I went to school not far from here so that made it even better"" he said. ""My parents were here and some of my college teammates.""

On the bright side for the Tigers right-hander Drew Hutchison who has been a starter all season and through most of his career pitched four strong innings out of the bullpen allowing a run and two hits.

""Drew threw the ball really well"" Hinch said. ""He's continued to get lefties out which is really important for him in any role. This is a tough lineup with a lot of potent left-handed hitters.""

Hutchison made two starts for the Tigers last month before being designated for assignment. He stayed in the organization and has a chance to finish the season as a bulk reliever.

""I know probably better than anyone how tough it is to get opportunities"" Hutchison said. ""So when you get one you've got to take advantage of it regardless of the role. If you get an opportunity and they give you the ball you've got to perform.""

Tunheim has denied Conagra Brands Inc.’s motion to dismiss a lawsuit filed by Schwan’s Co. alleging the former of violations of the federal and Minnesota trade secrets acts as well as tortious interference with contractual relations and unjust enrichment under Minnesota law.

The lawsuit filed in the US District Court for the District of Minnesota involves a former employee Rongxuan Cai who worked for Schwan’s from June 30 2003 until Dec. 18 2017 first as a research scientist and then as a principal research scientist. During his time at Schwan’s Mr. Cai worked on research relating to the properties and performance of yeast and flour dough moisture and rheology protein content in cheese and development of ingredient technologies for use in pizza crusts and frozen pies.

According to the complaint Mr. Cai accepted a job to work at Chicago-based Conagra on Nov. 10 2017 but did not submit a letter of resignation to Schwan’s until Dec. 15 2017. At that time he requested an effective date of Jan. 5 2018. When Mr. Cai was asked on Dec. 18 2017 whether he intended to work for a competitor he denied it according to Schwan’s. Schwan’s said it found out later that day that he had accepted a job with Conagra and immediately terminated him and escorted him from the property.

Schwan’s alleges that from the time Mr. Cai accepted the job at Conagra until he was escorted from Schwan’s property he accessed files containing Schwan’s confidential and proprietary information and trade secrets on several projects related to grain pizza crust and encapsulated sugar among other projects. Schwan’s also alleges that Mr. Cai copied files to external storage devices including files with confidential and proprietary information and trade secrets shortly before his termination and that he took physical property and materials that belong to Schwan’s including 13 devices including storage devices containing Schwan’s information lab notepads and other research information.

During his time at Schwan’s Mr. Cai was required to sign multiple noncompete documents with the latest being signed in 2011 and including provisions that he return all Schwan’s property upon termination as well as a noncompete clause that bars working for “any business which competes with Schwan’s in the geographic or job function areas assigned to” Mr. Cai for 12 months after termination.

In its complaint Schwan’s also alleges Mr. Cai filed two US patent applications and one Chinese patent involving methods for making frozen dough and frozen bread. The patents were filed on Dec. 27 2017 nine days after he was terminated from Schwan’s. In the lawsuit Schwan’s said it has asked Mr. Cai to assign the patents to the company but he has refused to do so.

Aside from Mr. Cai Schwan’s has taken issue with Conagra Brands alleging the company was aware of Mr. Cai’s exposure to Schwan’s confidential proprietary and trade secret information as well as his noncompete clause but took no steps to ensure he did not participate in projects for Conagra on similar products and technologies or to ensure he did not use Schwan’s information and secrets.

Schwan’s said it learned of Conagra’s actions during its discovery period and amended its complaint in April 2021 to include Conagra. On July 14 2021 Conagra filed a motion to dismiss a motion that Judge Tunheim denied.

“The court will not dismiss any of Schwan’s claims against Conagra as the face of the amended complaint adequately alleges each claim” Judge Tunheim wrote in his Dec. 2 decision. “It does not establish the statute of limitations has run for the DTSA (Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016) and MUTSA (Minnesota Uniform Trade Secrets Act) claims or that Schwan’s waived the tortious interference with contractual relations claim. The amended complaint adequately alleges all elements of these claims including that Conagra’s actions were independently wrongful for the tortious interference claim though the court does not decide whether such an allegation is necessary. Finally Schwan’s has adequately alleged that Conagra was unjustly enriched by more than just misappropriation of trade secrets so the unjust enrichment claim is not displaced at this time.”

A spokesperson for Conagra said the company does not comment on pending litigation.",,,,,,,,,,,,

But he's certainly been affected by it.

Like many others who developed life threatening health conditions after participating in in post-Sept. 11 2001 terrorist attack recovery efforts  Yodice has lived as a hermit for much of the past 18 months.

He had little choice.

A Consolidated Edison electric utility employee in New York City for most of four decades Yodice spent three straight weeks working 12-hour shifts within view of ground zero helping restore power to lower Manhattan. His first shift came hours after planes struck the World Trade Center's twin towers.

More on COVID-19:How many people have died of COVID-19 in your Florida community? State won’t tell you

Boynton Beach news:What's Boynton Beach's official policy on monuments? Commissioners decide against one

""It was like one of those 'day after' things"" Yodice said.

For those three weeks Yodice inhaled a constant stream of toxic dust and smoke. Respirators were available he said but their use was sporadic and there was confusion about who should wear them and when.

In 2019 Yodice was diagnosed with prostate cancer one of 68 cancers linked to the 9/11 attacks. He underwent nine weeks of radiation and was recovering when the pandemic struck last year.

Because the radiation treatments had compromised his immune system Yodice holed up in his apartment on the western edge of Boynton Beach for more than a year Because he lives alone his physical exposure with people came exclusively from delivery drivers. Most painfully Yodice said he wasn't able to see his three grandchildren missing out on his granddaughter's first Communion.

The pandemic he said was hard for him.

Cancer respiratory disorders are most common illnesses linked to 9/11

He's not alone. Cancer and respiratory disorders are among the most common illnesses attributed to 9/11 and its aftermath. Those are also among the conditions that make people more susceptible to bad outcomes if they contract COVID-19.

""The 9/11 community is scared to death of COVID and for good reason"" said Michael Barasch a New York-based attorney who has helped Yodice and thousands of other 9/11 survivors and first responders receive assistance through a victim compensation fund.

Around 100 of the approximately 25000 clients his firm represents have died from the virus said Barasch who is affiliated with the Boca Raton law firm Weiss Handler and Cornwell P.A.. Most had been treated with chemotherapy for their cancers or endured respiratory illnesses that include asthma or COPD a potentially lethal combination when mixed with COVID.

John Mormando feels fortunate.

A commodities broker at a firm a few hundred yards from the World Trade Center Mormando stayed home on 9/11 to babysit his young son.

But he enthusiastically returned to work less than a week after that attacks as the nearby rubble continue to smolder. Mormando said he and his colleagues were made to feel like ""heroes"" upon their return.

""We ate it up"" said Mormando of Oakland N.J.

He had no idea that the air he was breathing was full of toxins. And he had little reason to worry. Christine Todd Whitman then administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency had proclaimed ""the air is safe"" around the collapsed towers.

In the ensuing years Mormando developed skin cancer. Then breast cancer. He underwent a double mastectomy three years ago.

""I just thought I was the one lucky person that got male breast cancer the one guy in a million"" said Mormando referrring to the fact less than one percent of breast cancers occur in men.

That was before he learned that a number of his former male co-workers had also developed breast cancer.

Besides the double mastectomy Mormando underwent chemotherapy and radiation treatments. He remains in remission but not out of danger.

In March 2020 Mormando was sickened by COVID and developed double pneumonia.

""All anybody was talking about was deaths"" Mormando said. ""Everyday was a death count. I was definitely scared.""

Mormando 54 was checked into a hospital and said doctors wanted to intubate him. He refused. ""It probably saved my life"" he said.

Mormando said he's ""recovered pretty well"" pointing to the Ironman triathlon he completed six weeks ago.

Not everyone is so lucky.

Why COVID-19 and 9/11 illnesses are 'often a death sentence'

Bararsch calls COVID-19 and 9/11 illnesses the ""perfect storm"" and said it's proven ""quite often to be a death sentence"" for his most at-risk clients.

In March 2020 Barasch produced a public service announcement aimed at the 9/11 community calling for those at risk to ""heed the advice of experts.""

Yodice the Boynton resident said he did just that. He rarely ventured out of his apartment and had virtually no contact without anyone until receiving his second vaccine dose in April. He declined to travel even at the cost of not seeing his family until a recent trip to North Carolina to visit one of his three daughters..

Even now Yodice isn't taking any chances. He always wears a mask in public and is anxious to receive a booster shot when it becomes available.

""I don't think this is going to disappear"" Yodice said. ""It's going to stick around like the flu. But maybe we can get a better grip on it.""

But who would have thought Kirara’s cursed technique would make not just Megumi and us rack our minds over it?

Hoshi Kirara – the brand new wild card entry along with Hakari Kinji astonished us. If the odd situation of the fandom mistaking them for a girl wasn’t enough they also turned out to be a solid defense for Hakari. Panda and Megumi fought with this new character over a couple of chapters making one thing clear. Kirara is not to be taken lightly.

And more importantly that Kirara’s cursed technique is pretty hard to understand. Worry not and sit tight; we are going to unravel this puzzle in this article! Before we begin though we must learn a bit about the stars.

The Southern Cross constellation or Crux

Kirara’s name and character design were a foreshadow of their cursed technique. Kirara Hoshi (星綺羅羅) translates to ‘sparkling star’ and they even had star-shaped pupils. Moreover their four face piercings were another tell of the Southern Cross or Crux constellation. It is important to know about this to understand Love Rendezvous.

The Southern Cross or Crux is a very famous constellation of the Southern hemisphere. As the name suggests Crux is based on four stars and is the smallest of 88 modern constellations. However a fifth & less bright star mars this perfect cross shape of the constellation.

Acrux is the brightest and south-most star of the constellation. This star is assigned the Alpha Crucis name and the other stars follow suit. Mimosa is Beta Crucis Gacrux is Gamma Crucis and Imai is Delta Crucis in order of brightness. Ginan is not part of the ‘cross’ per se but it is still included in this constellation and is assigned the Epsilon Crucis title.

While people widely recognize these five stars as the Crux there is another sixth star with the name Tupa. The International Astronomical Union has officially approved the names of all the six stars of the Crux constellation. Even more additional info says that there is a cluster of stars called the Jewel Box Cluster in the Crux.

Source: Wikipedia Space.com Constellation Guide

An important thing to note here is that 2D diagrams aren’t entirely accurate for constellations. We know that such diagrams only represent two dimensions: length and breadth. But constellations also have depth as the manga says too; the depth of a constellation matters too. So it might look like Ginan is on the same plane as Acrux because there is no depth to see from this visualization.

The manga’s representation of the Southern cross takes the depth into account as well. This diagram clarifies a bit of confusion about how the technique works but it makes the constellation look haphazard. Again this is because we cannot gauge the depth of constellations from the Earth and is only apparent in space.

The conclusion Akutami wanted us to reach is that each star has a certain distance from the Earth. What does all of it mean in baby terms? It means one can trace a pathway from a particular star to a different one. This path will follow the depth of the constellation meaning one can’t go from Gacrux to Acrux directly and has to follow a specific path. (More on this in the next section)

A wee bit complicated right? But don’t worry! The application of this technique clears it up. Akutami deliberately explained this technique to us twice in the same chapter. It was pretty hard to understand if we had not seen it in action. Let’s dive into it!

What is Kirara’s cursed technique Love Rendezvous?

Love Rendezvous is based on the Southern Cross constellation. It can mark any entity with cursed energy or its residuals with a star from Crux and its name. So we can conclude that it applies to shamans shikigami curses and even inanimate objects with cursed energy. But the range of this marking is not very large.

Each marking creates a sort of barrier of a few meters around itself possibly a radius enough to maintain the least distance between two stars. In essence this barrier is the most significant element of Love Rendezvous. There is another thing when it comes to marking residual cursed energy on objects. It seems that Kirara’s cursed technique cannot mark the owner of the residual cursed energy. So unlike Demon Dog and Megumi the technique won’t consider them as one unit.

Additionally Kirara does not need to touch a person or thing to mark them with a star. Until now we saw that they could mark five stars (I think we know why) at once. However there is no limit on how many entities Kirara can mark with the same star. And now for the most interesting part. How the heck does Kirara’s cursed technique work?

When Kirara marks a person or thing with a star they are bound to a particular pathway. This pathway or relay goes something like this: Imai → Acrux → Mimosa → Ginan → Gacrux. In simple words if you are Imai you can approach Acrux and then Mimosa but not go to Mimosa directly. This relay also works vice versa because Acrux can approach Imai too.

To make it clearer this happened with Panda and Megumi when they were Imai and Acrux respectively. They could come close to each other but not go to Kirara who was Ginan without going through Mimosa. Then this also explains why Panda (Imai) could never cross the distance to the room’s door (Gacrux). Plus there was a stalemate between Kirara Megumi and Panda because none of them could reach Kirara.

Furthermore the entities marked with the same star attract each other. We saw this happen with Megumi and his shikigami Divine Dog and Rabbit Escape. Since they were all Acrux they were attracted to each other. In fact when Panda tried to throw a car with the Imai mark (from Kirara’s cursed energy) he could not throw it.

What is more is that Kirara could even remove the star from their cursed energy and mark anything else. That would free them from the array whilst their opponents would be stuck with finding out the marking. A shaman can cancel Love Rendezvous only by going through the array of markings. Megumi very quickly deciphered one thing: it was pretty impossible to approach Kirara himself to cancel the technique.

What exactly did he do? He blocked Divine Dog from reaching him using a wall and unleashed it when Kirara was between them. Since Divine Dog was also Acrux and Kirara was Ginan Megumi canceled Love Rendezvous without approaching Kirara himself at all. This was also possible because of a single rule that governs attraction in Love Rendezvous:

The one outputting more cursed energy is the one who pulls other things or people with the same star name. So when Megumi used cursed energy to protect himself from Kirara’s attacks he pulled Divine Dog towards himself. He took a gamble and guessed that such a rule exists when Divine Dog had the same effect earlier.

Another thing to clear here is why Panda and Megumi wanted to keep Kirara from going through the room’s door. The door was Gacrux while Panda and Megumi were Imai and Acrux. Even if they had gone through Mimosa Kirara’s Ginan marking would have been under the Gacrux barrier!

This little event tells us a crucial thing too. Let alone Panda and Megumi if Kirara marks an enemy with Imai or Acrux while marking themselves as Ginan and Hakari as Gacrux nobody will ever be able to come close to them! As this post suggests rendezvous means a meeting between two people. So Kirara’s cursed technique can protect two people if they stick together!

Here is a little fun fact: Love Rendezvous references two different songs according to Twitter user soukatsu. The kanji for Kirara’s cursed technique is 星間飛行 that is Interstellar Flight a reference to a Macross Frontier ED. And Kirara’s reading of the kanji gives us another reference to ラヴランデヴー or Love Rendezvous which is a song by Angela.

Possible strengths and weaknesses

Love Rendezvous is a mind-blowing technique. No doubt. It is so solid that if it had not been the specific circumstance of Megumi’s intellect and technique Kirara would not have lost. The strengths of this technique could be the following:

As we discussed before Love Rendezvous is invincible when it comes to protecting two people. Even if an enemy does figure out their technique they would not be able to surpass the Gacrux barrier. But a question arises here. Can Kirara’s technique also mark cursed techniques like Gojo’s or Sukuna’s? If Kirara marks Itadori would that prevent them from Sukuna’s techniques?

Another strength is that there could be ANY object in the vicinity with cursed energy or residuals and Kirara could mark it. The manga has not specified it yet but if there are no exceptions about the object’s size or minimum limit of cured energy it would be FANTASTIC! One could spend hours on end searching for the next star.

Moreover there is no upper limit to how many entities Kirara can mark with the same star. This simple-looking fact can be dangerous. Imagine if Megumi could actually not release his Rabbit Escape and all of them were Acrux. Hell. He would have died of his own accord!

But there are a few downsides of the Love Rendezvous technique too. The first two are blatantly obvious I think. As the story emphasizes the range of Kirara’s cursed technique is not that huge. If a shaman or object goes out of range the technique will release automatically.

Secondly the technique only works against two enemies at most. It was obvious from Kirara’s showdown against Megumi and Panda. Plus if Kirara has to save themselves they have to mark themselves as well. It means the user of the technique is not independent of it unlike other techniques.

The flaw above can extend to the fact that the user cannot reach the other person they are protecting fast enough. A stalemate hinders the speed of the user. Love Rendezvous is also highly a defensive technique rather than attacking. Sure it can use some small attacks like pulling objects by using touch or residual energy to the opponent. But anything major is out of the question.

We are unsure of the time duration Kirara can hold the fort in battle. Naturally it must be tiring to keep switching markings and keep an eye on the enemy. The technique must also use cursed energy in proportion to how powerful the target is. In fact even the number of enemies Kirara is marking with the same star could affect them.

Although the manga said that Kirara only has five stars UNTIL NOW we can never be too sure. It is possible that Kirara could use Tupa as well. However it is unlikely that they could use any other constellation with their technique. Further is it possible for Kirara to have another move using the Jewel Box reference? The story will tell us!

So there you have it! Kirara’s cursed technique Love Rendezvous is one of the most complex techniques of Jujutsu Kaisen. By this technique Akutami taught us a bit of astronomy now after some math and mythology. I personally enjoy such references a lot because it shows just how much thought Akutami puts into the story and power system.

Through the agreement Corteva Agriscience receives an exclusive global testing license and associated optional commercial rights for a novel biofungicide technology that can help protect potatoes grapevines vegetables and stone and pome fruits against pathogens such as downy mildew late blight powdery mildew and botrytis.

“This agreement furthers our commitment to offering farmers biologicals for crop protection including tested biofungicide solutions that meet Corteva Agriscience’s high standards in Research & Development” said Rajan Gajaria Executive Vice President Business Platforms Corteva Agriscience. “Our agreement with Gaïago is another step in demonstrating our efforts to building our biological portfolio by collaborating with the leading experts in their fields.”

“Achieving sustainability in agricultural production as well as a resilient food system requires strong collaborations at all levels” said Jean-Pierre Princen President of Gaïago.

“This agreement with Corteva will speed up the global introduction of one of our natural biocontrol technologies. This novel biofungicide should be key both to implement integrated pest management strategies and to meet consumers’ expectations whilst helping to preserve high crop yields and increasing farmers’ income.

“This global collaboration with Corteva together with the launch of our joint research programs with scientific institutions in Europe will boost Gaïago’s large-scale Agrosystems regeneration plans hence restoring soil and plant functions.”

Corteva’s model for developing its best-in-class Biologicals portfolio combines external innovation R&D collaboration licensing and distribution. This agreement demonstrates how Corteva is targeting collaborations that bring a broad range of external technologies including well-established companies in the Biologicals space to expand access of a complete set of sustainable solutions in line with the Corteva Agriscience 2030 Sustainability Goals.

William Corrigan

“This announcement is an exciting development for UK and Irish farmers who want and need to be able to access a range of solutions including those derived from natural origins” said William Corrigan Corteva Agriscience UK and Ireland Country Manager.



“We look forward to expanding our biologicals portfolio further alongside Gaïago and in line with our local global and sustainability goals. Corteva is committed to providing UK and Irish farmers with innovative world-leading solutions as they work hard to produce enough food for a growing world population while contending with extreme weather events and a shrinking toolbox of chemical solutions.



“Biologicals will have a key role in agriculture going forwards and we’re excited for the leading role Corteva will play in expanding and developing cutting-edge products.”

Credit: Vladimir Badikov VOA

Ten years after authorities finish deconstructing the 9/11-damaged Deutsche Bank Building the southern part of its footprint remains undeveloped in 2021 as plans for the construction of a future Five World Trade Center tower await approval from several governmental agencies. The Lower Manhattan Development Corporation retains ownership of the land parcel known as site 5 which is bounded by Washington Albany and Greenwich streets.

After the National September 11 Memorial plaza opens to the public in September 2011 LMDC allows the southern portion of site 5 to be used as a waiting area for ticketed visitors to the plaza which is surrounded by a fence. The site 5 waiting area is vacated on May 15 2014 when a dedication ceremony is held for the National September 11 Museum and the Memorial plaza’s fence is removed giving visitors free access to the plaza for the first time.

LMDC decides to develop the vacated southern portion of site 5 into a temporary park as part of a project with Downtown Alliance a nonprofit group that advocates for Lower Manhattan businesses. The park opens to the public on September 2 2014. Named Albany Street Plaza it features benches trees and a colorful mural on a wall separating it from a police command post.

Credit: Vladimir Badikov VOA

LMDC allows the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to builds trailers on the northern portion of site 5 in 2014. The trailers contain office space for the Port Authority Police’s World Trade Center Command which moves into the temporary facility on April 24 of that year.

In a major step toward realizing the vision of a 5 WTC tower New York Governor Andrew Cuomo LMDC and the Port Authority issue a request for proposals on June 26 2019 seeking plans from developers to either lease or purchase the site for the construction of a commercial or mixed-use building.

LMDC and the Port Authority decide on February 11 2021 to enter into exclusive negotiations with a consortium of developers that proposes to lease the site and build a largely residential tower. The 99-year lease would require the developers to pay rent directly to the Port Authority.

The consortium is led by U.S. firm Silverstein Properties and Canadian-owned firm Brookfield Properties and includes two smaller New York-based firms Omni New York and Dabar Development Partners.

The Port Authority tells VOA that negotiations with the consortium on finalizing the lease for a future 5 WTC continue through August with no word on when they are likely to conclude.

New Saint Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church & National Shrine

Almost 20 years after the original church is destroyed on 9/11 construction of a new Saint Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church and National Shrine nears completion at a nearby site in August 2021. It is designed by Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava whom the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America first commissioned to draw up plans for the new building in 2012.

Credit: Vladimir Badikov VOA

Calatrava’s design released in 2013 envisions a domed white marble building surrounded by four pillars modeled on Istanbul’s Hagia Sophia and Church of the Holy Savior in Chora two iconic former Greek Orthodox churches later converted into mosques by Turkish authorities in 2020. Located at 130 Liberty Street on the eastern side of the World Trade Center’s new Liberty Park construction of the estimated $20 million project begins with a ground-breaking ceremony on October 18 2014 and reaches a “topping out” stage with a temporary cross placed on the building’s skeletal dome on November 29 2016.

The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey which agreed to let the archdiocese rebuild the church at 130 Liberty Street as part of a 2011 land swap agreement signs another deal on August 21 2017 to lease the site to the archdiocese for 198 years. The new agreement sets the rent for the church-shrine at a nominal $1 per year and gives the archdiocese the option to buy the site at any time during the lease also for a nominal fee. The archdiocese agrees to let the Port Authority maintain ownership of the site so that the governmental agency retains responsibility for securing permits and regulatory approvals during the construction process.

But building work stops in December 2017 when Swedish construction company Skanska says the archdiocese is not paying it. The archdiocese reveals months earlier that it is in a severe financial deficit that has been building for years and hires PricewaterhouseCoopers in April 2018 to investigate the church-shrine project’s finances and major cost overruns.

The investigators conclude in October 2018 that there is no evidence of fraud or improper usage of funds by archdiocese members. The archdiocese also accepts the investigators’ call for the creation of a new independent entity “Friends of Saint Nicholas” to raise funds to complete the stalled project.

The Friends of Saint Nicholas group raises millions of additional dollars from private donations enabling construction to resume on August 3 2020. Total raised funds reach $95 million in June 2021 almost five times the original projected cost of the rebuilding.

In a statement to VOA the archdiocese says the church-shrine’s exterior is expected to be completed by the evening of September 10 2021 when it will be illuminated from the inside for the first time.

Chris Meloni and Mariska Hargitay enjoyed each other's company during an evening off from filming their respective Law & Order shows.

Meloni 60 surprised his former Special Victims Unit costar 57 with a friendly kiss on the forehead on Friday as he arrived in the Grey Goose box at the US Open to watch Novak Djokovic take on Alexander Zverev. Although Hargitay knew her longtime scene partner would be in attendance she reportedly wasn't aware they'd be seated in the same box.

During the match Hargitay sat next to husband Peter Hermann 54 as Meloni popped up in the row behind them arriving with his wife Sherman Williams 61. The group cheered on Djokovic who prevailed over Zverev 4-6 6-2 6-4 4-6 6-2 during the semifinal at Arthur Ashe Stadium.

""I was just so sad because we started this thing and built it together"" Hargitay told PEOPLE of her costar's departure in February. ""And we went through so many milestones and spent so much time together and understood so many things that nobody else could understand.""

The pair has carried their bond over to the recently-premiered spinoff Law & Order: Organized Crime which is led by Meloni's Detective Elliot Stabler. Hargitay has revived her role as Captain Olivia Benson in several episodes of the first season which brought their characters closer together than ever. The show has been renewed for a second season which premieres September 23 on NBC.

The next big thing since Starbucks announced the return of its Pumpkin Spice Lattes in August is the return of Costco's 12-inch pumpkin pies on the wholesale retailer's bakery shelves. Though the store just officially announced the return of its pumpkin pie Costco fans have been spotting this seasonal favorite since as early as August 24.

Known to be one of Costco's best-selling items the pumpkin pies racked up a whopping $6.1 million in sales for the chain in 2019 (via People). Of the four months that the pie was available $2.1 million worth of sales came in within the three days leading up to Thanksgiving weekend alone. Why the hype you ask? It's all in the pie's fall-flavored creamy filling and perfectly firm flaky pastry crust of course! In fact Spoon University found Costco's 4-pound pumpkin pie to be the best amongst its Target Walmart and Trader Joe's counterparts.

Costco's pumpkin pie is a savior for anyone who can't be bothered to make a pie from scratch. Fans were quick to show their excitement on Costco's pumpkin pie post with comments like ""best pumpkin pie on the planet"" and ""got one yesterday and it's all gone everyone enjoyed it"" pouring in on the chain's Facebook page.

Chase Briscoe driver of the No. 14 Cummins/Rush Truck Centers Ford Mustang for Stewart-Haas Racing:

“This was one of my best runs at Richmond for sure. I think we still have a long way to go but I don’t hate it as much as I used to. It certainly helps when the car is handling the way it’s supposed to. The result doesn’t show the effort put in and how strong we were but I feel like it was something that I can build on now that I kind of understand how to drive the track.”

A devastating burst after half-time set the stage for Ballymartle to claim the points in this Co-op Superstores Cork SAHC Group B game played in Blarney this afternoon.

The Carrigdhoun side trailed by 1-9 to 1-8 after a tight and competitive first half but a stunning 3-2 haul in the eight minutes after the break meant that there was no way back for Mallow.

Darren McCarthy struck for the first goal of the salvo his second of the game after being set up by Shane Cummins. McCarthy then turned provider for Luke O’Callaghan who finished with aplomb before two points from McCarthy and Jack Dwyer left Mallow reeling.

Then Shane Cummins buried another goal to give Ballymartle an unassailable 4-10 to 1-9 lead.

When Mallow finally cleared their heads Ronan Sheehan looked set to goal but a stunning block from Colm Coleman diverted the ball over the bar and the Avondhu side must have known that it wasn’t going to be their day.

They kept chipping away however with Gary Sweeney and Sheehan keeping the scoreboard ticking over and at one stage the margin was down to five points but a stunning Brian Corry goal in the final minute of normal time was the cherry on the cake for the men from the south-east.

A tight first half was dominated by two goals at either end. Denis Hayes struck for Mallow’s major after four minutes to give his side a 1-1 to 0-1 lead and that goal allowed them to keep their noses in front throughout the half.

Three points in the 16th minute from Sweeney Paul Lyons and Steven O’Callaghan saw them lead by 1-7 to 0-5. Unfortunately for them however McCarthy then rattled in his first goal reacting quickest to a Shane O’Mahony free that came back off the post.

Two Sweeney frees for Mallow were then bettered by three Ballymartle points from O’Mahony Eoghan O’Leary and O’Callaghan to leave just one between them at the break.

Then came Ballymartle’s tour-de-force and next for them is Bride Rovers while Mallow must re-group for an Avondhu derby against Ballyhea.

Scorers for Ballymartle: D McCarthy (2-5 0-3 frees) L O’Callaghan (1-2) S O’Mahony (0-4 1 free) S Cummins (1-1) B Corry (1-0) J Dwyer (0-2) A Gould and E O’Leary (0-1 each).

Woonsocket-based CVS is under fire by groups that claim it is supporting the Texas legislators who pushed to limit abortions in that state and by one of the leading nurses' organizations that say the corporation is funneling millions through a dark money organization to block Medicare reforms.

The pressure by the advocacy groups comes on top of a 2018 report of how CVS was one of the biggest funders to then-President Donald Trump’s reelection campaign.

While CVS may be in the politically blue northeast its campaign dollars are often going to conservative and red-state causes.

CVS is the 4th largest company in the United States by revenue.

Nurses Blast CVS on National Zoom

On Friday National Nurses United held a national Zoom to discuss what they say is how CVS funneled $5 million to the dark money group Partnership for America’s Health Care Future.

This is the largest donation in the country to the anti-Medicare-for-All group according to Riley Brann during the Zoom.

Lee Fang a reporter for The Intercept wrote “The seven-figure donation from CVS is the largest known contribution to PAHCF which was formed in 2018 to lobby and advocate against proposals such as Medicare for All the public option and similar reforms that have gained growing support in recent years. PAHCF is a 501(c)(4) and is not required to disclose donor information.”

“Last year PAHCF swamped voters in Democratic primary states such as South Carolina with ads urging voters to oppose Medicare for All. In states considering the public option the group hired local lobbyists and aired advertisements designed to discourage state legislators from voting for the plan. And just before the general election the group again aired ads attacking the public option” reported The Intercept.

CVS defends PAHCF. ""The Partnership for America’s Health Care Future (PAHCF) is a coalition whose stated mission is to build on and improve what's working where private coverage Medicare and Medicaid work together to expand access to coverage and care. CVS Health is not currently funding the PAHCF"" said Mike DeAngelis CVS Health Corporate Communications.

The Rhode Island-based Womxn Project announced this week the launch of a campaign to demand CVS stop giving money to politicians attacking abortion access.

“CVS Health is headquartered here in Rhode Island. They gave more than $70000 to lawmakers in Texas who pushed Senate Bill 8 a horrific policy that takes away abortion access early in pregnancy and threatens people with a lawsuit if they help someone get care"" said the Womxn Project in a statement.

According to The Womxn Project ""CVS has a slogan 'for your own good.’ Well it doesn’t do anyone any good and is downright dangerous to support bans on abortion. We are not going to be silent as a big company right here in our backyard is doing real harm.""

""We are demanding that they make a public commitment to stop giving money to any lawmaker using their power to undermine access to abortion and put up barriers to reproductive healthcare. You don’t get to talk about working to ‘support the unique health needs of women at every age’ and then contribute to politicians who take away care that one in four women will use during their lifetime"" said the organization.

""CVS should not give money to politicians who take away access to healthcare and interfere with decisions around reproductive health. Until they halt this harmful practice they shouldn’t get our money! We are not going to be silent as a big company right here in our backyard is doing real harm! No more” added the Project.

DeAngelis said ""...contributions to elected officials are often taken out of context and used to further a narrative that simply does not exist. This is especially true when people point to our political giving going back as much as four years without clarifying that these are not all recent contributions. Past political contributions are by no means a blanket endorsement of an individual’s position on every issue nor are they an indication of where we will direct future support.""

""We are very transparent about our political giving publishing an annual political activities and contributions report on our public website"" he said.

That’s why it’s more important than ever to educate a new generation – the post-9/11 generation – about the events of the day; the hope resilience and unity experienced in its aftermath; and the way 9/11 has shaped the world in which we live today.



In this milestone year we are announcing a new awareness and fundraising campaign to support the National September 11 Memorial & Museum’s educational programs and our mission to fulfill our collective promise never to forget.



The Never Forget Fund will ensure that our key educational programs which are more relevant than ever will connect to a new generation and beyond. The limited edition Never Forget Ticket is a permanent keepsake in commemoration of the 20th anniversary of 9/11 that includes a free ticket to visit the 9/11 Memorial & Museum. Available with a donation of $50 these hand-etched tickets proudly made in the United States can be a meaningful way to help younger members of your family connect to the history of 9/11. The Never Forget Ticket is also available for bulk purchase as a gift to corporate employees. You can learn more and donate at https://neverforgetfund.org/.

In conjunction with The Never Forget Fund we are launching an awareness campaign focused on the importance of teaching a new generation the lessons we learned in our response to 9/11: the healing renewal and hope we shared together.

Reform the System. (Published 2021),"On Sept. 26 2019 the Department of Justice appointed me to serve on the Official Unsecured Creditors Committee in the bankruptcy case against Purdue Pharma the company that helped fuel the opioid overdose crisis through the misbranding and reckless marketing of the powerful painkiller OxyContin. The committee acted as a mega-plaintiff with broad powers to subpoena records take depositions and cross-examine witnesses. For nearly two years I attended countless negotiations depositions and chambers meetings. I read thousands of pages of confidential documents revealing the true nature and depth of Purdue’s liability in the crisis.

The proceedings came to a close on Sept. 1 2021. The final settlement promises as much as $10 billion to be distributed among states municipalities the federal government victims and other corporate creditor groups through a restructured company. $4.5 billion of that will come from the company’s former owners members of the Sackler family in exchange for civil releases from any future litigation pertaining to the overdose crisis. Only about $750 million was reserved for direct payments to those most injured by the company — more than 130000 victims who filed claims for harms associated with OxyContin ranging from addiction to death by overdose.

Ignored by a system devised to protect extreme wealth and perpetuate social disparity Purdue’s victims find themselves doubly victimized. I know this because I not only represented the victims; I’m one of them.

After my appointment to the nine-member committee I was elected one of its two co-chairs. We had a fiduciary responsibility to over 600000 parties with claims against Purdue.

With vaccination proof required for entry in multiple workplaces colleges and even all indoor activities in New York City the card can be your key to entry.

No matter where you got your shots getting a replacement card is possible.

If you got vaccinated at local store or pharmacy

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends contacting your vaccination provider directly to receive a new card. That could be Walgreens CVS a local hospital or your local pharmacy.

Walgreens and CVS both state they will write a replacement card for you based on their records of your COVID-19 vaccination.

If you got the vaccine at Walmart or Sam’s Club there will soon be a digital version of your card available created by a coalition of private and public organizations. That initiative will also issue an app to various businesses and organizations that will allow them to check the digital vaccination cards.

The QR digital vaccination system will also roll out in the State of California and Louisiana and is already in use in New York through its Excelsior Pass.

If you got vaccinated at a mass vaccination site

If you can’t contact a provider directly or you attended a mass-vaccination site run by the state the CDC recommends contacting the health department for your state.

All vaccinations are reported to those agencies and individuals can request a copy of their records.

Other tools

Additional tool are the online portals v-safe and VaxText which are maintained by the CDC and can be used to access your information if you registered with them after your shots.

The CDC also encourages everyone to take a picture of their vaccine card as a back-up if something happens to the physical version.

Be on the lookout for fake cards

With COVID-19 cards being required for entry in more places there has been a rise in fake COVID-19 cards.

Fake cards can be found as cheaply as $25 on Instagram and are prolific all over the internet.

In March the concern over fake COVID-19 vaccination cards prompted the FBI to issue a joint statement with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services urging people not to buy create or sell fabricated vaccine cards.

The unauthorized use of the seal of an official government agency such as HHS or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is a federal crime that carries a possible fine and a maximum of five years in prison.

In April a bipartisan coalition of 47 state attorneys general sent a letter to the CEOs of Twitter Shopify and eBay to take down ads or links selling the bogus cards.

Many of the sites have blacklisted keywords related to fake cards but places to buy the documents are still popping up on messaging apps chat forums and the dark web."

Over the last 20 years Muslims in America have faced unfair stereotypes across the country following the events of 9/11.

Archived footage of Muslim community members in the Quad Cities from September 22nd 2001 echo similar statements from those living in the area in 2021.

We reached out to the following three individuals who shared their experiences during 9/11 and what they've gone through as Muslims living in America since then.

Tauseef Ahmed Manager at John Deere

On September 11 2011 I was working at the John Deere Moline office. One of my colleagues came to my desk and told me about the incident. Then I went to the cafeteria where we had TVs showing one of the World Trade Center towers hit by the plane.

I was shocked to see it. Other office colleagues started to gather in the cafeteria to watch the news. As we were watching the replays of the first tower being hit suddenly we witnessed another plan approaching and hitting the second tower.

I could not believe it. It felt like as if I was watching a movie however it was for real. The questions came to my mind were how is this possible? Who did it and why?

I finished my work early that day and went to pick up my wife from the Bettendorf Library and told her about the incident – she could not believe me. At home we were glued to the TV watching the devastation. We felt very sad and shocked.

Later that day we started to see news that the U.S. Government had started to figure out who was behind it. I was devastated to learn that the attackers were Muslim men.

I could not believe why a Muslim person would do such a heinous act. To me obviously they were not following the teachings of Islam because in Islam whoever kills a soul unjustly is as if he had killed all mankind and whoever saves a life is as if he had saved all mankind.

As days passed and more news came the focus shifted to the Muslims. The society in general became curious and skeptical of Islam and the Muslims. Here in the Quad Cities people started asking questions of QC Muslims: How it’s possible?

As a person of faith I had to explain that Islam is a religion of peace and taking innocents’ lives is forbidden in Islam and the Muslims of QC strongly condemn this monstrous attack. Also during that time there were numerous people proactively reached out to the Muslim community to show their solidarity and love and ensured their support in case of any backlash.

9/11 surely has changed the world and impacted many for me it allowed me to reflect deep on my faith how I could share the true meaning and the spirit of Islam – which is peace and love for all.

I am fortunate to have caring people of all faiths in the QC who understand it and continue to stay as great friends and neighbors and work together on common causes to improve the lives of the people

As usual I had the TV running in the background while I was preparing for my evening classes that day. Suddenly the loud noise and consecutive events happening on the screen momentarily paralyzed me. It took a few minutes to comprehend what was exactly happening.

I then spoke to my husband on the phone who was at college and asked him if he had seen what had happened in New York. Then I sat there watching the horrific scenes from the Twin Towers and then saw that unbelievable collapse of the buildings.

My first reaction was ""What is happening?""

I felt scared confused helpless as tears rolled down my eyes. Who are these people? As the news kept coming I heard they were Muslim terrorists. I was in shock and awe. What kind of Muslims do these kinds of horrific acts?

When I went to campus later my students and I were terribly saddened during lecture that evening and just talked about how it is possible for people to do such horrific act. We all comforted each other and prayed for all the people and families affected by this incident.

As days went by I knew the terrorist attacks of 9/11 would set in motion events that would change the course of my life the lives of others in the US and the world.

There would be backlash incidents. People calling names harassing women in scarves a student on campus getting jumped just for having a Muslim name. In days to come I was nervous and scared since my classes ended late in the evening. I used the help of campus security to get to my car.

But soon friends neighbors and other faith organizations came forward in support against any backlash. People and community came forward and shared grief and sorrow along with us on all levels.

Islam stands for peace and our teachings are for peace and solidarity. The Quad Cities community stood by us and understood this. Terrorism has no religion. Over time I've come to ignore the haters.

The first words any Muslim says before doing pretty much anything are “In the name of God the most compassionate the most merciful."" Thus love and mercy are supposed to be central to our consciousness as a Muslim. As an American Muslim those words pave my life’s path towards peace and solidarity no matter where I live and whatever community I work with.

Matlub Ahmad Physics and Engineering Professor

I was teaching my Engineering Graphics class at the time. When I came out to the hallway and saw lot of students glued to the hallway TV screen. By then the network was showing a replay of the first hit on one of the twin towers. There was a collective silence. I approached one of my colleagues and asked what he had seen.

The horror that was unfolding in front of us was unreal. I called my wife at home and the first thing she said ""Oh my God have you seen what happened in New York?""

For about an hour we were watching the horrific scenes from twin towers and then saw that unbelievable collapse of the buildings. As more news kept coming I was beginning to feel sick to the stomach.

My first reaction was ""how could this be happening?""

As the day went by everything appeared to be like gloom and doom. In the afternoon I met my Astronomy class and the collective mood in the class was of despair. We talked about personal stories of connections to loved ones who were in New York who worked in the proximity of the World Trade Center. We all tried to comfort each other. It was somber as if we all lost someone personally connected to us.

In the evening news I saw more details of the terrorist identities. On the local TV I saw a reporter interviewing one of my Muslim friends about his reaction and opinion.

His first response was that this act was against the faith of Islam and more so against humanity. I knew that a wave would come for blaming Muslims and we may have to defend our positions against acts of violence. It was an act that nobody no faith no culture can accept. I just remembered all the things we learned in our Study Circle how we viewed oppression.

One phrase kept reverberating: If you kill one soul it is as if you have killed all of humanity and if you saved one soul it is as if you saved the all of humanity.

We held a meeting of the trustees of our Islamic Center in Moline. I was taking minutes and we passed a resolution condemning in the strongest terms the terrorist attack against our country and denounced any act of terrorism using the name of Islam. We were not sure how the community should extend support for the victims whether we should have a blood drive raise funds or send team of volunteers. We were a very small community then but we all remained firm in terms of providing support to the best of our ability.

In the days that followed we were receiving calls from neighbors and other faith organizations expressing support for us against any backlash. We prepared to open our center to the wider community to come and share our collective grief and to let everyone know what the teachings of Islam is. The fact that Islam stands for peace and despite all the noise in the media we did not let our voice be drowned. The community of the Quad Cities responded and understood that terrorism has no religion.

The events of 9/11 gave me the perspective to learn about myself and my connection to my faith. It deepened the conviction of what is to be an American and to be an American Muslim.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdpbGxldHRlbmV3c3JlY29yZC5jb20vbmV3cy93eW9taW5nL2FydGljbGVfMGM3MDQyMWEtOTA4MS01OGVjLTliYzItMDg5ZGJmMzEyZTVmLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Company woos WyoTech students with jaunt on private jet,C&B John Deere recently used one of its private jets to transport a group of WyoTech advanced diesel mechanic students to several of its dealerships.

Mournfully on the morning of Tuesday Sept. 7 2021 Susan Flores a lifelong resident of Safford passed away at the age of 70.

On April 22 1951 Susan was born in Safford Arizona to Manuel and Lilia (Tarango) Gaona. On May 30 1970 she married Daniel Flores of Central Arizona. Together they raised two daughters Michelle and Dannette “Dee” and one son Joseph in a home they purchased in 1975.

Susan Flores

Susan had a passion for her children shopping yard sales going out to eat and crafting. She cherished summer and school breaks every year because Sophie her only granddaughter would come to stay at her house. On Facebook Susan started the Yardsales Only public group to provide area residents with yard sale details. She would attend the local craft sales and loved making bracelets. Susan would often make memory candles for her friends and family honoring their recently departed. Susan was a member of the American Legion Auxiliary Unit# 95 helping serve our veterans. She worked at John Deere Sal’s Market Subway R&R Pizza and State Farm Insurance Agency. Susan acquired a large salt and pepper shaker collection along with an array of antique figurines. “With God all things are possible” was Susan’s favorite bible verse and she lived those words in her actions. She was known for her giving nature infectious smile and kind and compassionate spirit.

Susan was preceded in death by her husband Daniel; father Manuel and her brother Manuel Jr. “Sonny.” Her three children and their spouses survive her; Michelle (Brian) Kuhn Dannette “Dee” Flores (Carlos Vargas) and Joseph (Joan) Flores; her only granddaughter Aurianna Sophia Vargas; mother Lilia Gaona; sister Connie Contreras (Nick) and several cousins nieces nephews and many friends.

The Boeing 737-900 has 180 passenger seats but there were 182 passengers on board.

The aircraft returned to the gate quickly to offload the extra passengers but this is uncommon enough I tried to find out how this happened and why the aircraft was moving back from the gate without everyone on board being seated.

@garyleff @Delta DL1732 from CHS to ATL pushed back without enough seats for everybody onboard (2 standing). Feeling some PIA vibes. — Jack Hake (@JackHake) September 12 2021

This passenger on board shared that the aircraft pushed back – and then two passengers walked to the front of the aircraft. A “flight attendant came over the PA and mentioned two passengers onboard didn’t have seats and we’d need to go back to the gate to let them off” he explained.

The plane wasn’t yet on an active taxiway so it was a quick return. The two extra passengers deplaned and the flight still managed to operate on time.

According to Delta Airlines spokesperson Kate Modolo

Delta flight 1732 from CHS to ATL this morning deplaned two employee stand-by passengers who did not have appropriate seat assignments. Our commitment to the safety of our customers and crew remains our No. 1 priority.

Apparently prior to closing the boarding door there were two empty seats that were assigned to non-revenue standby passengers although the passengers originally assigned to those seats were actually on the aircraft. I often see for instance passengers using the lavatory right when they board and before taking their seats.

Clearly the last-minute employee standby passengers figured out for themselves that they lacked seats and according to one of the passengers on board identified that there was a problem. This all happened almost right away as the aircraft pushed off.

The incident calls to mind two contrasting times recently where planes actually did take off with more passengers than seats.

Pakistan International Airlines boarded 416 passengers on a Boeing 777 with 409 seats for the 1700 mile flight from Karachi to Medina. The extra passengers stood in the aisle. It turns out the captain says he only learned about the situation after takeoff and the airline didn’t want to dump fuel to land back in Pakistan so they just continued on.

And two years ago a TUI flight operated from Mahon Spain to Birmingham UK with seat assignments that didn’t exist for three passengers due to an aircraft swap. The plane carried fewer passengers than planned. Nobody was denied boarding. Instead the family sat on the floor throughout the flight while using jumpseats for takeoff and landing.

Neither of those things happened here. Delta caught the mistake and returned to the gate. Although I wonder what would have happened if the two seats did appear open because passengers were in the lavatory — and they spent an especially long time there not coming out until the plane was airborne?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9kZWx0YS1hbGFza2Etc2VhaGF3a3MtYmF0dGxlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Battle For Seattle: Delta And Alaska Go After Seahawks Fans,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9kZWx0YS1hbGFza2Etc2VhaGF3a3MtYmF0dGxlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9uZXdzL3NwaXJpdC1mcm9udGllci1uby1yZWdyZXRzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why I no longer avoid flying with Spirit Frontier and other budget carriers,"Before the pandemic the first thing I used to do when browsing Google Flights was filter out all the ultra-low-cost carriers including Spirit Frontier Allegiant and Sun Country.

I wasn't particularly excited about being nickel-and-dimed throughout the end-to-end travel experience from bags to seats to snacks and more. Plus I didn't want to forgo the miles or elite perks that I'd enjoy on one of my preferred network airlines.

Yet over the past year my thinking has changed. I'm no longer avoiding budget airlines; in fact I've flown multiple domestic flights with Spirit and Frontier and even traveled on Wizz Air in Europe — and I'd happily do it again.

It starts with timing

Throughout the pandemic every U.S. airline has cut routes and slashed frequencies to better match supply with the reduced demand. Though budget carriers aren't immune to the pandemic they've already restored much of their domestic network — and are even growing steadily.

In October Frontier and Spirit will fly 5% and 1% more domestic flights than they did two years prior respectively well before the pandemic even started. As for the Big 3 network airlines — American Delta and United — they're down an average of nearly 15% flights in October 2021 compared to two years prior according to Cirium schedules.

Now more than ever I'm finding better-timed flights with the budget airlines than I am with the legacies. Case in point: I recently flew from Fort Lauderdale (FLL) to New York on a Wednesday night. I was visiting my parents in South Florida and wanted to spend the entire day with them.

The last United flight of the day left at 4:55 p.m. American at 6:30 p.m. and Delta at 7:57 p.m. All of those options meant that I'd need to skip dinner to head to the airport.

Fortunately Spirit had the last flight of the night a 9:22 p.m. departure to Newark (EWR). I could relax with my family during the day and leave for the airport after an early dinner.

In the past I might've filtered out this flight and skipped some family time but the pandemic has made me rethink my priorities — and nowadays I'm booking on schedule more than anything else.

Easier than ever to be a free agent

Of course flying with Spirit meant that I missed out on earning some United American or Delta miles and I wouldn't get credit towards requalifying for Premier 1K or Executive Platinum status.

But because of the pandemic that didn't matter much. For one I wasn't forgoing that many miles. (A $79 United fare would've netted me 660 MileagePlus miles as a 1K member worth about $9 according to TPG valuations.)

Perhaps more importantly it's now much easier than ever to requalify for status thanks to all the limited-time promotions and reduced thresholds. I no longer feel locked on the ""elite-status hamster wheel"" because the airlines have made it dramatically easier to keep my status.

As a free agent I now feel empowered to book away from my preferred airline if the timing works better.

You get what you pay for

One of my favorite elite benefits is free upgrades. Buy a coach ticket and have a chance at scoring an upgrade to first class.

With Spirit Airlines you can outright purchase the equivalent of a domestic first-class recliner for a fraction of the price. On my recent Spirit flight the Big Front Seat was going for $46 a modest upcharge for a much more comfortable experience.

With a 2-2 arrangement 36 inches of pitch and 18.5 inches of width Spirit's Big Front Seat is like locking in the first-class upgrade at the time of booking — for the price of a coach ticket.

While it would've been tight in the back purchasing an upgraded seat made for a much more comfortable and enjoyable experience. On other budget airlines I usually purchase an exit row seat for the added legroom.

The pandemic has leveled the playing field

Though there's still a notable difference between flying with Spirit or Frontier and say Delta it's not nearly as stark as it would've been before the pandemic.

It's a no-frills experience flying with a budget airline. You won't be served any snacks or drinks in the air nor is there an airport lounge to enjoy before boarding.

Flying Spirit's Big Front Seat (Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

Nowadays flying with one of the major network airlines is a limited-frills experience. While inflight service has been resuming it's still a far cry from pre-pandemic levels especially on American and Southwest which continue to ban alcohol sales in the coach cabin.

True most domestic airline lounges have reopened but they've pared back their offerings — in some cases you could find a more relaxing environment outside of the lounge than inside of it.

Reliability has improved… generally

One of the biggest reasons why I've long avoided ultra-low-cost carriers is their reliability. If a flight is canceled or significantly delayed the next flight might not be for a few days and you couldn't be reaccomodated on another airline.

While that still holds Spirit and Frontier have made great strides in improving their operation. For one they've both invested in a new fleet of Airbus aircraft.

According to Department of Transportation data Spirit Airlines canceled the fewest number of flights between April 2020 and March 2021 compared to the ten largest U.S. airlines — just 1.57% of its more than 116000 flights did not take off. Excluding canceled flights both Spirit and Frontier operated nearly 90% of their scheduled flights on time during the same period.

Of course Spirit just suffered from a massive operational failure that left thousands stranded for over a week. It took the airline nearly two weeks to get back on its feet. I certainly would've regretted choosing Spirit if I was scheduled to fly during this meltdown and hope it doesn't happen again soon.

Bottom line

I used to avoid flying ultra-low-cost carriers. If I chose Spirit or Frontier I almost always regretted it.

But nowadays I've done more budget airline flying than ever before thanks to convenient schedules improved reliability and the option to purchase a comfortable seat.

All things equal I still unequivocally prefer a major network airline but I'm no longer filtering out the budget carriers like I was doing before the pandemic.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimwFodHRwczovL211c3RyZWFkYWxhc2thLmNvbS9zb2NpYWwtbWVkaWEtY3Jpc2lzLWFsYXNrYS1haXJsaW5lcy10YWtlcy1oZWF0LWZvci1mYXQtc2hhbWluZy1idWxseWluZy13b21lbi1ub3ctY2VvLWluLWhvdC13YXRlci1pbi1hLWJsaXN0ZXJpbmctdGlrdG9rLXZpZGVvL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Social media crisis: Alaska Airlines takes heat for fat-shaming bullying women; now CEO in hot water in a blistering ...,"Alaska Airlines has been taking a lot of heat from customers on social media lately. And it just got hotter for the “woke” company that is based in Seattle.

It all started June 23 when Alaska Airlines kicked a woman off of a jet at SeaTac International Airport for what it said was a mask violation.

Sara Gamache

Recently two more women in two separate incidences said they were kicked off of a jet for showing their midriffs. They were wearing tops that were like bathing tops.

In the most recent case a Fairbanks woman says the airlines was fat-shaming her for showing too much skin. Both of them covered up when asked to do so but they were kicked off the flights anyway and said they were humiliated in front of other passengers.

Alaska State Sen. Lora Reinbold has been put on the Alaska Airlines no-fly list for lack of mask compliance although it appears her “offense” didn’t take place on board the flight but in the waiting area.

Reinbold has now asked to be excused from the rest of the legislative special session because she can no longer fly to Juneau since Delta Airlines has ended its summer service to the Capital City.

But now it’s really serious for the airlines. On TikTok a social media app that displays short videos the CEO of Alaska Airlines is being accused of having affairs with women employees associates or contractors.

“Meet Alaska Airlines CEO Ben Minicucci” the video narration starts. “In 2016 Ben who was married at the time had a secret love affair with this woman…” This woman? She was the designer for the Alaska Airlines uniforms.

The video goes on to claim that he also had an affair with an airline flight attendant from Virgin Air who bore his child.

Minicucci has been with the airlines for 17 years and was with the company when it bought Virgin Air. In March he became CEO of the Alaska Air Group. The airlines has taken a frontline position in the culture wars supporting the terrorist group Black Lives Matter and eliminating the phrase “Ladies and Gentlemen” since it may offend some people onboard. Alaska Airlines is also promoting special deals for black Americans.

The TikTok video embedded here has been edited at the beginning to remove the specifics of the allegations against Miniccucci but the entire video is available on the TikTok account of pnw.huntress the handle used by Sara Gamache.

Gamache was the woman removed from a flight in June because of her Trump mask which also had the words “Fuck Your Feelings” on it.

Read: Woman was tossed from Alaska Airlines flight due to her Trump mask

Within days of that incident Gamache launched a website to begin to collect stories from others abused by the airlines. She has dozens of stories now many of them from employees of Alaska Airlines.

One flight attendant wrote to Gamache with the following complaint about Alaska Airlines:

“I have been employed by Alaska Airlines for 30 years. I have seen the horrific changes over the decades from being a family airline with prayer cards on the meal trays to this liberal CCP bill crap that Alaska has become.

Regarding Gamache and her mask Alaska Airlines issued a statement telling its side of the story:

Statement from Alaska Airlines:

Sara Gamache threatened legal action and called for a boycott of Alaska Airlines after being removed from a flight on June 24 2021. Ms. Gamache falsely claims that she was removed for wearing a mask with a pro-Trump political slogan. In fact she was removed for refusing to follow crewmember instructions on multiple flights and because a profane statement appeared on the mask in violation of Alaska’s policy.

After boarding her June 24 flight in a mesh mask Ms. Gamache became confrontational when a flight attendant requested that she wear a proper mask in compliance with federal law. Ms. Gamache reluctantly agreed to do so but then put on a mask that said “Trump 2020; Fuck your Feelings.” The flight attendant informed Ms. Gamache that the profanity violated Alaska policy and that she needed to change masks yet again which escalated Ms. Gamache’s disruptive behavior. Per Alaska’s procedure Ms. Gamache was asked to exit the aircraft. The video Ms. Gamache posted on social media was taken after her confrontational exchange with crewmembers once she changed her mask for a third time.

This was the second incident in which Ms. Gamache defied crewmember requests to comply with the federal mask policy. In January Ms. Gamache received a yellow card for repeated refusals to wear an appropriate mask. We expect our customers to comply with Alaska policies and federal law when they choose to fly with us. We must take action when they refuse to do so. We’re thankful and appreciative of the efforts of our dedicated crew members who are committed each day to keeping travel safe and respectful.

Republican Sen. Lora Reinbold on Thursday requested the excusal from Saturday through Jan. 15. She said she was unaware of any other airline flying to the state capital during that period. Her request was accepted by the Republican-led Senate without any objections.

Juneau is accessible by air or water including via the state-run ferry system. Lawmakers are in their third special session of the year which is due to end Tuesday unless legislators finish earlier. It's not clear if any other special sessions will be held before the next regular session begins in January.

Lawmakers can request excusals from the House or Senate floors for such things as personal or state business. The Legislature has yet to finalize a dividend amount to pay residents this year.

Delta Air Lines provides seasonal service to and from Juneau which the company said began in late May this year and ends this weekend.

Alaska Airlines in April said in a statement that Reinbold was not allowed to fly with the carrier ""for her continued refusal to comply with employee instruction regarding the current mask policy."" The company said the suspension was effective immediately ""pending further review.""

On Thursday airline spokesperson Tim Thompson said by email that Reinbold's case ""was reviewed earlier this year and she was notified of the outcome. Nothing has changed with her status from earlier this year.""

Reinbold in response to emailed questions said she had been in compliance and called the ban political.

She said the ferry schedule is limited and she doesn't want to hold up legislative proceedings if she cannot reach Juneau ""in a timely fashion.""

Following her suspension in April Reinbold drove through part of Canada and took a ferry to reach the capital a two-day trip.

If there is another special session Reinbold who is from Eagle River said that session should be held in a community that is connected to Alaska's main road system. Eagle River is part of the Municipality of Anchorage.

Reinbold has been critical of masking rules including at the state Capitol.

""If accommodations can be made for efficient and safe transportation opportunities I plan to be in Juneau for special session for significant votes"" she said."

The county council is currently rolling out upgrades in residential areas and says all of its 79000 illuminations will be converted from traditional sodium bulbs to the energy-efficient equivalent by next year.

It reduce their carbon emissions of by 75 per cent – more than 15000 tonnes each year – the equivalent of taking 8000 cars off the roads writes Local Democracy Reporter Ollie Heptinstall.

In mitigation the lighting will operate as part-night lighting for the majority of areas and in addition dim to 75 and 50 per cent brightness later into the night…

But a recent study suggests the ‘eco-friendly’ illuminations which produce more of the blue light mainly seen by insects are more harmful to them than sodium bulbs.

Researchers at the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology found the number of moth caterpillars in hedgerows along rural English roads was 52 per cent lower under LED lights and 41 per cent lower under sodium lights when compared with nearby unlit areas.

In grass margins the moth caterpillar population near LEDs was a third lower than in unlit areas while sodium lights had little effect on abundance.

Writing to the Devon County Council’s (DCC) cabinet Councillor Alistair Dewhirst said: “The energy efficiency of these lights is clearly a fact and is helping to improve our carbon efficiency…but it would appear to be at the expense of our insects.”

He asked what the council will be doing to ‘mitigate the harmful effects on our insect population’.

In a written response Cllr Stuart Hughes cabinet member for highways said: “The rating of the new lamps is 3000K (kelvin) which is very similar to the sodium lamps they are replacing.

“Insects are generally attracted to lighting above 3000K therefore any possible effect on the insect population is argued to be neutral when the new lamps are run at 100 per cent brightness all night.

“However in mitigation the lighting will operate as part-night lighting for the majority of areas and in addition dim to 75 and 50 per cent brightness later into the night.”

Cllr Hughes added: “DCC is also extending its management software in new installations where possible which will give much more control on future dimming.

“However we will keep this under review as greater understanding of this topic develops.”",,,,,,,,,

For some it's unclear,"One of over 290 Digital Realty data centers across the world is located in Trumbull Connecticut. It is the highest-profile data center currently in Connecticut. Credit: Yehyun Kim / ctmirror.org

This story has been updated.

As more and more businesses have shifted IT operations to the cloud state leaders around the country turned to data centers — the giant server warehouses that power the internet — as one way to rejuvenate their economies coming out of the Great Recession.

Over the past decade-plus more than 30 states have created tax breaks or other incentives for data center construction and the technology sector’s biggest players from Facebook to Google and Amazon have taken full advantage.

This year Connecticut joined the race.

In late February state lawmakers passed emergency legislation allowing the Connecticut Department of Economic and Community Development for the first time to offer tax incentives to certain data center developments.

Specifically the state will waive sales and property tax obligations for 20 years for data centers that invest at least $200 million in Connecticut — or just $50 million if the facility is located within a state-designated enterprise zone. The tax exemptions could be extended to 30 years if a $400 million investment is made or a $200 million investment in an enterprise zone.

But with so many other states offering incentives and Connecticut arriving relatively late to the game the legislation’s expedited passage through the Assembly struck some observers as odd. The bill obtained emergency certification — sending it immediately to the floor for a vote with no committee referrals or public hearings.

DECD Commissioner David Lehman said that was all because of one particular detail: Connecticut agreed to waive its right to impose a financial transactions tax on any qualifying data centers. At the time New Jersey lawmakers were considering passing a $0.0025 tax on every financial transaction processed electronically in the state. Given how much of Wall Street’s exchange server infrastructure is located in New Jersey the proposed tax had massive implications for the finance industry.

“We were moving very quickly” Lehman recalled. “The governor myself and others were having conversations with these companies around potentially relocating their exchanges to Connecticut … This legislation was really important if they were going to make the move.”

Connecticut lawmakers had the data centers bill on Governor Ned Lamont’s desk within a week. Lamont signed it on March 4.

Lehman estimates Connecticut could have seen as much as $750 billion in data center investment if New Jersey had passed the financial transactions tax. But New Jersey’s bill has stalled in committee and it looks like the data centers powering Wall Street are staying put for now. “There’s no imminent move from the financial exchanges at this time” Lehman said.

Richard Auxier a tax policy analyst with the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center said he’d be surprised to see any state pass a financial transactions tax or FTT given the possible negative economic consequences and the tenor of the opposition it’s raised to date. Plus he added “my guess is states are too busy with [American Rescue Plan] funds and other pandemic-related issues to start tackling new taxes like this at the moment.”

So about that emergency bill

The prospects have dimmed for Connecticut to wrest Wall Street’s back-office data infrastructure from New Jersey. But in several communities particularly in the eastern part of the state other kinds of data center developments — aimed at a broader clientele — are beginning to take shape.

Depending on the agreement they work out with the local municipality new data centers will typically make an annual flat-fee payment in lieu of paying local taxes on the property value of their real estate and equipment. It’s a significant discount but supporters say it could be worth the trade-off.

“This gives more opportunities to some of our rural towns that may have farmland being taxed at the [lower] farmland tax rate” said Republican Sen. Heather Somers of Groton. “Some towns are looking at generating millions of dollars off this.”

Somers also said that compared to other industrial sites data centers are “low impact.” Once construction is completed there are no trucks or heavy-duty machinery on site and the small number of employees means there’s essentially no impact on traffic in the surrounding area she said.

“Usually on property tax exemptions we get very hesitant” said Randy Collins of the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities. His group worked with legislators to include language in the bill that would protect towns in cases where the developer doesn’t hold up their end of the deal. “We wanted to make sure a municipality wouldn’t be taken advantage of” Collins said.

At the same time CCM didn’t want to cut off an economic opportunity for distressed communities. “When you take a town with no economic prospects for this parcel — sure in a perfect world I’d get $5 million on this parcel but I take $1 million. Maybe the economic development around it will build off what they’re doing” Collins said.

For developers the up-front investment and lead time for data center projects is substantial. In some cases the towns they’re targeting will have to draft new zoning rules since many laws on the books hadn’t contemplated this particular type of development. Data center developers can apply for the state incentive program only once they’ve worked out a fee agreement with the local town. From there they negotiate a power purchase agreement with the local utility and begin construction.

In the short-term construction could create well over 1000 jobs per site. But data centers generate far fewer permanent full-time positions. Lehman estimated each project could result in 25 to 50 permanent jobs. He and others described those jobs as “white collar” noting the higher salaries would boost payroll tax revenue.

Not everyone saw eye-to-eye on the program’s costs and benefits.

State Sen. Matt Lesser D-Middletown one of five senators who voted against the bill expressed his concerns during the Senate debate in February before the vote was taken.

“We are gathered here to try to lure an industry to Connecticut that as far as I can tell will provide few lasting jobs but provides major costs” he said. “Those costs are to taxpayers who will be providing the industry with significant 30-year tax breaks.”

Data centers “chew through” computer equipment and operators spend several million dollars a year to replace servers and other hardware said Bill Hassan a specialist in data center site selection with commercial real-estate brokerage CBRE. Under Connecticut’s new incentive program those equipment purchases won’t be subject to the state sales tax. If they were taxed at Connecticut’s 6.35% rate each data center could potentially owe several hundred thousand dollars a year to the state.

DECD’s Lehman said that’s a moot point because “The key thing around any incentive is if you didn’t provide it would this still happen?” Many other states grant sales tax exemptions for data center equipment he said and in order to compete Connecticut needed to offer the same.

“I think we can say hand on heart we would not have the investment over the next 10 years unless we put forth this legislation” Lehman said.

The Office of Data Infrastructure Administration and Security within the DECD launched July 1. Lehman said so far the office has fielded a handful of requests for applications from developers. Within three years he said he expects the number of approved new data center projects to be in the “mid- to high-single digits.”

Power struggle

Connecticut’s current data center tally stands at 14 and their overall data capacity is small compared to that of other states. The main reason for that is the relatively high cost of power in the state.

These facilities use a massive amount of power which means most development to date has happened in parts of the country where electricity prices are low. The average price per kWh for industrial customers in Northern Virginia for example is 5.5 cents. In New Jersey it’s 8 to 9 cents and in Connecticut it’s 12 to 13 cents. So a user who might pay $750000 a year for power in Northern Virginia would be paying more than $1 million in New Jersey and more than $1.5 million in Connecticut according to CBRE calculations.

David Silverstone who represents customers of the public electric utilities known as Connecticut Municipal Electric Energy Cooperative said there’s plenty of power available to add data centers to the grid. “However you’ve got to get the power to the customer” and that involves building a bigger power line out to the location in order to accommodate the additional capacity. “If you’re a data center there’s no pole in the street. There has to be a whole system to bring the power to you.” That would be another part of the power-purchase negotiation between the developer and the electric company — as well as additional cost he said.

Data center developers don’t just chase cheap power. They’re also looking for strong broadband infrastructure and minimal risk CBRE’s Hassan said. While developers in Connecticut could theoretically tap the fiber line along I-95 locations along the coastal corridor present other hazards he said such as hurricanes or the possibility of car fires and major accidents on the interstate. That could force a facility offline; in the internet infrastructure business that just can’t happen.

The fastest-growing data center markets today — Northern Virginia Portland Ore. and Phoenix — have found the sweet spot. In Connecticut one developer is finding his.

A few years ago Tom Quinn chief executive of developer Gotspace Data Partners started making inroads in parts of the state where electricity costs are lowest — namely towns that have public electric utilities and can potentially negotiate lower rates. Many of those are in eastern Connecticut where there are currently no data centers.

Quinn declined to be interviewed for this story but a paid advertorial this July in the trade publication Data Center Knowledge said Gotspace has “developed exclusively entitled campuses covering more than 1700 acres all located within these low-cost-of-utility areas.” (The piece also credits Gotspace with “creating the big data draft incentives working with the State of Connecticut and the DECD Commissioner and lobbying the bill to supermajority approval.”)

Before the legislation went into effect July 1 Gotspace purported to have reached host fee agreements to develop data centers in Griswold Groton Bozrah and Wallingford — all towns with public electric utilities. On the company’s website a drop down menu lists eight Connecticut locations under “Our Data Centers.”

DECD’s Lehman said “the initial interest is in areas where there are local utilities that have the ability to provide more competitive rates” but Gotspace isn’t the only company expressing that interest. He added that DECD expects to see “joint ventures and other forms of partnership as these data centers start to get built.”

Proponents hope that one or two big projects will attract a cluster of development making Connecticut a hub for data centers. And if that happens the argument goes there’s the potential for broader economic impacts. In a 2019 study the Metro Hartford Alliance estimated the construction of a 32MW data center (the power capacity Gotspace and others are targeting) could boost the state economy by $312 million and support 2065 jobs including 140 permanent positions with an average annual wage over $100000.

For some that’s still a big “if.”

Correction

An earlier version of this story incorrectly reported that by Gotspace Data Partners had secured host fee agreements with several towns in Connecticut by the time House Bill 6514 was signed by the governor. That could not be independently verified. The story has been updated.",,,,,,,,,,,,

According to an affidavit police responded to St. Augustine Beach in Florida to assist Fire Rescue crews with a lady that said she needed CPR.

Police and fire personnel asked the woman identified as 39-year-old Kailani Jo Kroll if she needed to be treated Kroll responded yes.

According to police Kroll was escorted to an ambulance where she fled on foot and was running back on forth in the street erratically.

Again police asked her if she needed treatment to which Kroll responded yes and then ran away yet again.

St. Augustine Police Officer Brandon Hand said in the affidavit “Due to no crime being committed at this point the subject was just acting erratic I had no reason to chase her.”

“As I was entering my vehicle I heard loud yelling coming from the Fire Engine on 5th Street. I heard someone yell. “she’s stealing the truck.”

That’s when officers had to pull Kroll from the driver’s seat of the Fire Engine and get her into handcuffs.

According to police Kroll began making spontaneous statements such as “I’m sorry for trying to take the truck I lost my marbles”.

When asked if she was under the influence of anything Kroll told police that she had taken the “Elixir of Life.”

Kroll was booked on Grand Theft Auto and Resisting Arrest.

Denise Gurley a 4th Grade teacher at Gilmore Elementary School in Brockton posted about a recent experience at a Dollar Tree in a local community group. After seeing her post we reached out and asked her if it was OK to share it with our readers. This is what she posted and she also sent along some additional information:

“Thursday night I went to the Dollar Tree around the corner from our house on Winthrop street to restock my prize box for my classroom. I frequent this Dollar Tree and people are always able to tell that I’m a teacher by my purchases lol and most of the cashiers know me on a first name basis!

“When I got the register I started putting the 75+ items I had gotten for prizes onto the conveyor belt and the cashier told me that earlier in the day there was a customer in the store talking about me. I was confused and she said that the woman described me as the “young brunette teacher always buying stuff for her students”. I giggled and didn’t think much of it. Then the cashier said that the woman purchased a $25 gift card and asked the cashier to hold it for me for the next time I came in.”

“I WAS FLOORED! I thought she was joking! The two ladies behind me in line who I had apologized to multiple times for having so many items and that they got stuck behind me were so kind and sweet in saying how much I deserved the gift card! Love the decent people out there that keep my belief strong that the world isn’t all bad. ? Thank you SO much to that generous customer you are incredible. ??”

– – – – –

In our follow up conversation Denise made the following statement which we are including in full.

“Let me preface that my school/district does provide teachers with supplies. Buying things for my kids is something I enjoy because it makes them happy and feel special. So buying prizes for our prize box is something I really love to do because they work hard to earn incentives and their hard work makes my job easier and enjoyable! This is my 11th year teaching and I have spent tens of thousands of dollars on my classroom and my students but I choose to because it makes them happy and makes me happy. My biggest addiction is buying books lol I have over 2000 books in my classroom library that I’ve built over the last ten years haha. But I don’t regret a single cent spent!” “I am so incredibly grateful for the kindness shown to me by a complete stranger it really gives me hope.”

– – – – –

We’ll simply say this; great job Denise thank you for all that you do and we know lots of other dedicated teachers who are following in your footsteps! Here is a photo of Mrs. Gurley’s classroom.

The toxic dust that fell as the World Trade Center towers collapsed 20 years ago continues to cast a dark shadow over America. 9/11 created a domino effect that would transform American culture and society for decades to come. On the 20th anniversary of the attacks on the twin towers the Daily Egyptian worked alongside River Region to tell the stories of those who lived through the attacks reported the news and those who would grow up in a world shaped by this traumatic event.

Lindsay King assistant lecturer at the school of journalism at SIUC was a junior at the University of Kentucky when two planes hit the trade center on September 11. She was watching the “Today Show” when the second plane hit. As a local NBC affiliate King had to deliver information on the attack to the public as swiftly as possible. It was the first time people reported without confirming the information or source.

“We were like sponges we wanted to absorb everything that we were hearing. We had no idea what was going on. In this country we’ve never experienced anything like that. I think the closest thing would probably be Pearl Harbor” King said.

Peal Harbor caused decades of discrimination against Japanese Americans. 9/11 reshaped the course of history and put a target on the backs of Brown and Muslim people all over the world. The media played a significant role in the way Muslim people were portrayed after the attacks. When the media began to report on the terrorists the words Muslim extremist and terrorist became synonymous.

“That’s so dangerous because in a way every Muslim was linked to this group … They became attacked because of the people who flew the planes into the towers” King said. “I think that was the time when you kind of see how dangerous the media can be.”

Sophmore public health student Dania Abou-Jabal a hijabi Muslim was born in November 2001 just a few months after the attack.

Abou-Jabal said the media has perpetuated negative stereotypes of Muslim people.

“The Islamic religion is really a peaceful religion and we are peaceful people. It really is sad to see the media portray Muslims as either being terrorists or women that wear the hijab as being oppressed. It really is just the wrong narrative that is put out to the American people and just the world in general” Abou-Jabal said.

Growing up in Carbondale Illinois Abou-Jabal said she was fortunate to live in a diverse and understanding environment; however when she and her family left the bubble of safety and acceptance to visit other cities they received a negative reception from the public.

“I have heard multiple comments. I’ve been called a towel head I’ve been called a terrorist. I’ve been told to go back to my own country even though I was born and raised here in America” Abou-Jabal said.

Annie Hammock managing editor of the Daily Egyptian woke up to the tragic news of the attack 20 years ago. At the time of the attack Hammock was working at CNN 17 years into her professional TV career.

“There were people in their homes who were able to just sit and take it in. We had to process it and we had to get it on the air and in a way that was going to help those people at home do their processing” Hammock said.

Hammock and her coworkers repeatedly consumed traumatic content in order to deliver the news to the public.

“Some of the images were horrific and most notable being the people jumping off the building. I think it may have run once or twice on air before the executivessaid ‘no there’s no purpose to it’” Hammock said. “These were real people who were jumping to their deaths fearing a much worse fate with being burned to death. They had two choices die in a horrible fall or they can be burned to death. To get into their heads was difficult.”

Although the station decided to stop showing the horrific videos the images have been burned into Hammock’s mind. Hammock said many journalists did not realize that they were developing PTSD from the repetitive viewing of these videos. 9/11 was the most difficult event she covered as a journalist- King was diagnosed with PTSD years after the attacks occured linked to her coverage of the event.

“How do you stay detached and objective when planes are crashing into buildings that helped define the best of what we are (innovative bold welcoming of other cultures). How do you write edit produce report any of it when two iconic towers crash to the ground and fear clings to you like the dust they became? You. Just. Do” Hammock said in a blog post years later.

 interim director for the School of Media Arts lived in Manhattan New York at the time of the attacks. A single father Spahr lived with his then 5 year-old son in the lower east side.

“I jumped in a cab because I was worried I was going to be late for work” Spahr said. “I noticed a lot of people looking south as I was headed north pointing up in the sky … I see a puff of smoke above the World Trade Center.”

Spahr didn’t think too much of the attack until one of his coworkers said a second plane hit the World Trade Center. When recounting the events that occurred that day Spahr broke down in tears. Spahr said there was no information about the attack.

“At that point all the information you got was on the street because all of the antennas were in the World Trade Center” Spahr cried “The towers were still standing there was a big hole and F16s circling.”

As soon as Spahr heard the news of the second plane crash he got a cab to go to get his son. As the F16s approached Spahr thought they were going to attack the capital.

“My son’s five at the time and he’s like ‘Dad why are you squeezing my hand?’ I grabbed him and we ran across Sixth Avenue. The planes were really low so I thought they were gonna swoop in and bomb us” Spahr said.

With no landlines or TV information was scarce in New York but the fear began to mount.

“The rest of the world was experiencing it through a screen and I didn’t see any of it on a screen until late at night” Spahr said.

Spahr said the atmosphere in New York changed that day. Generation Z has developed under a heightened state of fear and tragedy.

“We’re just now leaving Afghanistan. So the United States’ longest wars ended just a couple days ago … the soldiers who started to go fight after 911 their kids are now enlisted in fighting. That’s a lifetime of war”Spahr said.

Spahr said the results of our divisiveness creates a fear of “others”.

“We have militarized ourselves we’re looking inward with the same intensity that 911 caused us to go out and invade a country that had nothing to do with 911” Spahr said.

Salwa Ahmed senior social work student at SIUC. Ahmed 21 was only 1 years old when the 9/11 attacks occured yet the reverberating affects of 9/11 continue to impact her as a Muslim Indian American today.

“I grew up in Glen Ellyn and that’s a predominantly white area so I grew up thinking … Muslims were the bad guys Mulims are terrorists. I always felt like I had to defend myself … I shouldn’t have to defend myself it should be a given that not everyone is a bad person based on their religion” Ahmed said.

Ahmed recounted an instance when a preschool teacher called the FBI to her family’s home. When her younger brother was in preschool he jokingly said ‘oh I threw a grenade’ in conversation with his friends about the video game Halo.

“She overheard the conversation and actually called the FBI on us. I remember it so vividly … I remember I answered the door when they came to our house and I was just like ‘What’s going on? Who are you guys? Why are you here?’” Ahmed said.

Although Ahmed said she experiences several similar instances throughout her childhood this was not an isolated incident but instead a footnote in a series of microagressions and discrimination to come.

“I noticed my dad always gets pulled aside at the airport and gets a little extra screening done they ask for his ID when they don’t ask for anyone else’s” Ahmed said.

She said discrimination is an “almost routine” part of her daily life as a Muslim and as a Brown woman.

In the Black community parents sit their children down for “the talk” – a cautionary conversation that prepares Black American children for the racism and discrimination they will endure. According to Ahmed and Abou-Jabal a similar version of “the talk” is given to Muslim American children to protect them from harms way because of their religous beliefs.

“A lot of Muslim parents tell their sons don’t grow your beard long don’t talk about Muslims or Islam too much in public … don’t talk about like your religion too much” Ahmed said.

Jabal encourages people to make Muslim friends and to educate themselves before passing judgement on a community of peaceful people.

“I really hope that the American people could just talk to a person within the religion of Islam and really just have a one on one open conversation even if it turns into a debate” Jabal said.

9/11 caused two separate national tragedies that are still impacting American society today. The pain from that day lives on in those who experienced it documented it and the innocent who were – and are – targeted as a result of it. Tragedies have a way of unifying people with empathy and compassion but they can also ignite a fire of hate that divides us. As we reflect on the last 20 years since this horrific event occurred we continue to learn how to restore our humanity and empathy for one another.

Why worrying about a correction is still the wrong way to invest,"In this article .SPX

The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 Index just suffered five straight days of losses and their worst weekly performance since — wait for it — June. Investors went into the summer easing up a little bit on stocks and have exited the summer with a similar bout of selling. Is there any more to it? Is the big one — the stock market correction bears have been waiting for — finally about to drop? Many of the major factors cited for a potential selloff are well-known to investors implying it is harder to see how at this point they would be the ones to cause a correction. There's the delta variant. There's the Federal Reserve taper and shift in central bank policy amid a sudden slowdown in job and economic growth. There's the latest political headline — new wrangling in Washington D.C. over a corporate tax hike capital gains taxes and potential tax on stock buybacks to help fund President Biden's spending plan as well as debate over the debt ceiling. And there is the issue that has trailed stocks at every new record set during this bull market (and the bull market that preceded or depending on your view was interrupted by the pandemic): stock valuations are high. There are also short-term pressures to consider: the ""seasonal choppiness"" of the fall which market strategists say is real and recent U.S. equity market downgrades from major Wall Street banks which could keep pressure on shares especially with so much of the recent money coming into the market from retail investors. But it is always more likely something investors can't see coming (such as a pandemic) causes a historic market selloff than everything investors already know. That makes technical market indicators and the historical performance of the S&P 500 one reasonable way to gauge whether investor confidence will outlast the latest round of selling.

For Keith Lerner co-chief investment officer and chief market strategist at Truist the history of the S&P 500 suggests that the bull market isn't done yet even if gains moderate. Since 1950 there have been 14 years where the market has been up more than 15% through August. Stocks went on to add another 4% by year end on average and climbed in 12 of the 14 instances.

Stock selloffs are to be expected

Pullbacks are to be expected. The deepest pullback in 2021 has been roughly 4%. That is not typical according to Lerner's review of the data. The only two years in the historical data set that did not see at least a 5% pullback in the S&P 500 were 1995 and 2017. And history says gains that occur rapidly have to slow down. Lerner notes in his research to clients that the current bull market has gained 102% in 1.4 years versus the average bull market gain of 179% over 5.8 years since 1950. But following what Lerner calls the ""weight of the evidence approach"" in the technical indicators and macro environment the message for investors — not traders looking for every short-term move to make —is that U.S. stocks can still go higher over the next six to 12 months. Last week's losing streak in his view is not something to be alarmed about after one of the strongest starts to a year in several decades. Often when the market moves a lot the automatic reaction is to say it has to ultimately become a negative but Lerner says investors should not fear strength as long as it is supported by fundamentals. ""A trend in motion is more likely to stay in motion"" he said. ""The carousel of concerns continues to turn and when one concern recedes another pops up to take its place. There is always something to be concerned about ... there always can be something we are not talking about today that can sideswipe us."" Even if the black swan event doesn't materialize that doesn't mean there won't be 3% to 5% corrections. ""That's the admissions price to the market"" Lerner said. It doesn't mean investors should never make tactical moves but he says for the majority of investors it is better to stay focused on the next big move over the longer-term than the next move among traders.

Slowing economic growth isn't no growth

The economy may fall short of the rosiest expectations for a ""roaring 20s"" but Lerner is focused on the fact that a slower expansion still isn't a recession and stocks rise 85% of time in periods of economic expansion. Stocks are valued highly but he noted that the price-to-earnings ratio of the S&P 500 has not been making new highs this year even as the market as a whole has been. ""Valuations are still rich so we don't expect much P/E expansion and then its earnings growth driving so stocks can't grow at that same pace."" But he added that after the pandemic crash analysts had underappreciated the strength of earnings as a whole. That happens after recessions it happened after 2009 he said: estimates are cut too far and corporate profits come back faster than expected as companies cut costs and focus on efficiency. If the economy is still fragile now it is so amid a strong rebound off lows and GDP driving more sales and more of those sales flowing to the bottom line. ""And that's why we have record corporate profits"" Lerner said. Among the factors that should concern investors moderation in growth is one. After being positive for over a year the Economic Surprise Index has gone negative. ""And deeply negative"" Lerner said. That is an indication that after a year-long period during which investors and economists were underestimating strength and numbers were beating estimates now with Covid concerns and an economic slowdown the data has been surprising to the downside. But that's not a red alarm. ""It just means from our standpoint things caught up as far as expectations. But that's a slowdown. We see a peak but it will stabilize"" Lerner said. Passing peak growth doesn't mean weak growth and relative opportunities in the market remain a bigger focus than cheapest asset. ""There's no such thing as a 'cheapest asset' today"" he said.

The tech-led S&P 500 has internal issues

Within the S&P 500 he sees relative opportunities. The S&P 500 as a whole has not been as strong as its top heavily weighted tech stocks in the last leg up to recent records. The S&P 500 Equal Weight Index is up less than 3% since last May as the mega-cap tech stocks led the way. That was a reversal from early in 2021 when the inflation trade made the cyclicals outperform the mega-caps. And it means that as the stock market set new records there have been underlying corrections within stocks. Money hasn't left the market as much as rotated back to the huge balance sheet cash flow cows in tech that can continue to perform even in a slower economy. It's a sign that investors have become a little more defensive even within the S&P 500. But it also means that if the current carousel of concerns doesn't cause a sustained turn negative in equity sentiment returns within the S&P 500 can broaden out Lerner said. ""Internal rotation is heathy"" he said. ""We would be leaning a little bit on having a balance between the two. It's not so clear cut investors should be all cyclicals or growth. ... expectations have been reset sharply so a little bit of good news can go a long way.""

Two years after completing her degree Esther's Place of Grace opened in Newark with a ribbon cutting ceremony on Friday.

""It was my burden for women who have unexpected pregnancies and are single and unsupported by whoever — family friends"" Dow said in a recent interview with The Advocate. ""Just to have that safe home environment. A lot of women come out of abusive homes relationships couch surfing homelessness. It (the home) should provide that in this area and give them a chance to parent and be safe and learn some parenting skills learn some life skills get their education a little bit further and get a good job.""

Along the journey toward opening the home Dow encountered both challenges and successes. In addition to losing both her son and mother within a few months of each other Dow also discovered there was a lot to fundraising and to starting a nonprofit organization. But she soon found she had a lot of help along the way in support from her husband and others.

""It's a lot more than I thought it would be. But I know God's seen me through all of that"" she said adding the home opened Aug. 1 with their first resident.

According to Dow Esther's Place of Grace is renting a home in Newark which has three beds available currently.

Noting the facility is not an emergency shelter Dow said ""I just feel blessed that it can be something in the community people can use as a resource that really truly want to parent. A place where people come work through obstacles in their life.""

Dow said it will be a place where pregnant women feel they can let their guard down so they can work or attend school and better their lives to leave the home and live self-sustaining lives.

Women who are accepted into the home can stay up to one year after their child is born. Dow said criteria for being accepted is to be pregnant or have a child newborn up to 3-months-old. The house has a screening interview to be accepted. Dow said the women must also not have a current drug addiction and not be fleeing any serious domestic violence. Those women would be referred to New Beginnings a domestic violence shelter in Newark.

Dow said the women must also be willing to participate in programming and be part of a group living facility that has rules.

Some of Ester's Place of Grace programming includes courses on pregnancy and birth parenting courses smoking cessation healthy boundaries safety training counseling life skills programs and more.

Esther's Place of Grace board member and volunteer Pam Ianni said she met Dow and her husband through her volunteer work at Heartbeats in Newark. She said she decided to get involved because the maternity home fit in nicely with the work she was already doing at Heartbeats.

""It's a need in the community for women who are in a very difficult spot in their lives and find themselves pregnant and need a safe place where they're loved and can be helped to become the very best mom for their new child"" Ianni said.

As Esther's Place of Grace opens and looks toward its future Ianni said she hopes their team will be able to meet the needs of women who need a safe place to live and a chance to make change and break generational struggles.

""Some of our goals are to have women come into the program - basically it's the individuals' goals that we seek to accomplish that we want them to accomplish"" Dow said. ""Our ministry is to their physical spirital and emotional needs and we want to empower them to focus on their goals while they're in the program. They work on their life skills healthy boundaries healthy choices breaking generational cycles of poverty abuse and addiction.""

DTE Energy in a statement said that they were investigating an incident that happened near West Fort Street and Dearborn Street late Saturday night with collaboration from the Great Lakes Water Authority and the City of Detroit.

Details on the incident were limited Sunday afternoon with DTE stating that no natural gas explosion occurred but that DTE infrastructure had been impacted by a water main break. Meanwhile the Great Lakes Water Authority or GLWA reported that a gas explosion of some kind had taken place and caused a water main break.

Late Sunday in a news release the Detroit Department of Public Works announced indefinite road closures and a damaged buildings' impending demolition due to an “unknown underground issue.""

West Fort Street is closed at Miller and Woodmere streets and Dearborn Street is at Riverside and Stone streets according to the release.

The Detroit Fire Marshal also found an emergency contractor to demolish a commercial building at the intersection of the buckled road which was “heavily damaged due to the underground issues and is considered at immediate risk of collapse onto the sidewalk and utility lines” the release stated.

U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib D-Detroit on Sunday posted on social media photos of Dearborn Street buckled appearing several feet higher than its usual level. She wrote in the post that strong smells are being reported in the area and urged residents in surrounding neighborhoods to check on each other.

“We don’t know what this is and with a combined sewer system we have to be very cautious” Tlaib said.

State Sen. Stephanie Chang D-Detroit in turn shared the post as well and too encouraged residents smelling odor in the area to call the Michigan Department of Environment Great Lakes and Energy's pollution alerting hotline 800-292-4706.

""At this time there is no evidence to indicate natural gas was the cause of the incident; a natural gas explosion did not occur"" DTE Energy said in a statement. ""However parts of DTE's gas and electric infrastructure were impacted by a water main break. DTE personnel are on site to ensure public safety as well as the integrity of the natural gas and electric infrastructure systems.""

Michelle Zdrodowski chief public affairs officer for GLWA reported that a gas explosion caused the water main break but could not provide further details.

A field service team responded to the scene and the break was isolated on both sides she said. She said GLWA workers were asked to leave so DTE could work.

A spokeswoman for DTE Clare Liening when asked about GLWA's statement that a gas explosion occurred said that no injuries had taken place and that an investigation was underway.

John Roach spokesperson for the mayor's office directed questions on the incident to the two agencies.

Tiffani Jackson director of media relations for the Wayne County Executive Office on Sunday afternoon said that the roads division was providing support as needed but that the county was otherwise not involved.

The location of the incident on Sunday is a short distance from the Ford Dearborn Truck Plant. Ford Motor Co. has already this month grappled with issues at the Ford Flat Rock Assembly Plant after it leaked benzene-containing vapors into the city’s sanitary sewer system and residents were asked to evacuate.

“The incident was not on Ford property. We are not aware of any impact on Ford or our facilities” Kelli Felker Ford global manufacturing and labor communications manager told the Free Press on Sunday.

Stash Detroit a cannabis dispensary at the intersection of West Fort Street and Dearborn Street shifted a few feet off the ground when the road buckled.

General manager Ashley Babcock said employees heard a noise around 8 or 9 p.m. Saturday night before the road buckled and rose the store a few feet off the ground.

“We were all kind of shaken up” Babcock said.

Everyone in the store was able to evacuate in time Babcock told the Free Press and there were no injuries.

“We’re just grateful everyone got out safely” Babcock said.

She’s been smelling gas since June and workers had been out a few times for maintenance she said. They'd been reaching out to DTE she said.

The Free Press has reached out to DTE for additional comment.

Babcock said earlier in the day that the store building may have to be torn down as it rests on unstable ground. It was unclear at the time of the city news release if it was the building expected to be demolished.

“We’re planning to definitely reopen as soon as we can probably find a new location” Babcock said earlier in the day.

Amanda Madrigal a resident near the incident said she heard a small popping noise around 8 p.m. Saturday night.

“It’s scary. My kids are scared” Madrigal 40 said. “It has smelled like gas all day today and before that you could smell the gas when you were at the stoplight.”

With industrial plants a scrap yard and trucks constantly driving around nearby Madrigal said “This is just one more thing my family has to breathe in.”

Madrigal said she’s been living on that black for more than 30 years with her uncles and dad down the street.

“I love this street but the stuff happening around us is crazy. It’s like they don’t care that there are people that still live on this street” Madrigal said. “Not everyone can afford to just up and move.”

DTE said that if residents suspect or smell a gas leak they should leave the area immediately call 911 then call DTE at 800-947-5000 or their natural gas provider.

If they spot a downed power line DTE said to say 20 feet away and report it online at www.outage.dteenergy.com on the DTE Energy Mobile app or by calling 800-477-4747.

But with Dead & Company onstage Friday night Sept. 10 at the DTE Energy Music Theatre some 13000 fans — Deadheads and “tourists” alike — were at least as the song says “enjoying the ride.”

Of the several attempts to keep the Dead alive since the group’s unexpected end in 1995 following the death of guitarist Jerry Garcia Dead & Company has felt the most authentic. Grateful Dead veterans Bob Weir Bill Kreutzmann and Mickey Hart provide that foundation of course along with Jeff Chimenti a longtime band adjunct on keyboards. But this sextet’s third appearance in the metro area and second at DTE since its 2015 founding demonstrated again that the spirit is being moved forward by its now not-so-newbies — bassist Oteil Burbridge and especially guitarist John Mayer.

That pair insures that Dead & Company feels fresh as well as familiar. The repertoire Friday may have been drawn from the Grateful Dead canon — including covers of the Beatles’ “Dear Prudence” Henry Thomas’ “Don’t Ease me In” and The Band’s “The Weight” — but the younger members’ sensibilities brought just enough new flavor to all 18 songs without sounding like a gratuitous reinvention. Dead & Company may not take quite the same anything-can-happen tightrope walk of its predecessor but its well-practiced dynamic format insures that whatever does happen will be of a high standard and will certainly lift the tie-dyed throng in front of it to a kind of ecstatic rapture that spilled into the concourse between the pavilion and lawn despite security’s best efforts to keep it clear of the twirling dancers.

Dead & Company wasted little time easing into Friday’s show — more than three hours of music plus a 35-minute intermission — either. With a chunk of the crowd still in line having COVID vaccination or negative test proof checked the group hit the pedal hard with A-list fare such as “Hell in a Bucket” its 1980 single “Alabama Getaway” and a rich extended version of “Friend of the Devil.” Each member played his part of course but there’s no denying that like all Dead & Company shows Friday’s focused on the guitars and especially Mayer. Sporting a Mickey Mouse long-sleeved T-shirt and a full set of headphones the seven-time Grammy Award winner an established star well before Dead & Company made some references to the ringing tone that was Garcia’s trademark but was primarily his own man whether exploring the light psychedelics of “Dear Prudence” or the bluesy subtleties of “Black Peter.”

It was also Mayer at the center of the night’s highlights — a long romp through “New Speedway Boogie” a definitive version of Garcia’s “Deal” that opened the second set and an acrobatic tripling of “Estimated Prophet” “China Cat Sunflower” and “I Know You Rider.” Weir looking prophet-like with his mane of white hair and beard sang with greater command than he has in year and Chimenti picked his spots for tasteful piano and organ solos that were unfortunately under-amplified.

If Dead & Company made a misstep it came during the second set. The “Drums” improvisation by Hart Kreutzmann and Burbridge was exciting but following the agreeably out-there “Space” with a pair of blues “I Need a Miracle” and a labored “Black Peter” brought things to a crawl at a point more muscular dynamics were called for. “Casey Jones” got things back on track however and “The Weight” closed the night as a kind of pre-911 prayer that made Friday’s “ride” feel complete.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2plZmZrYXJ0LzIwMjEvMDkvMTIvdHJlZXMtdG8tY2FwdHVyZS1jYXJib24tYW5kLWNhc2gtaW4tbmF0aW9ucy1maXJzdC1wcm9qZWN0LW9uLXN0YXRlLWZvcmVzdC1sYW5kL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Trees To Capture Carbon (And Cash) In Nation's First Project On State Forest Land,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkart/2021/09/12/trees-to-capture-carbon-and-cash-in-nations-first-project-on-state-forest-land/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2plZmZrYXJ0LzIwMjEvMDkvMTIvdHJlZXMtdG8tY2FwdHVyZS1jYXJib24tYW5kLWNhc2gtaW4tbmF0aW9ucy1maXJzdC1wcm9qZWN0LW9uLXN0YXRlLWZvcmVzdC1sYW5kL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZXRyb2l0bmV3cy5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9kZXRyb2l0LWNpdHkvMjAyMS8wOS8xMi9zb3V0aHdlc3QtZGV0cm9pdC1yZXNpZGVudHMtc2Vlay1hbnN3ZXJzLWhvdXJzLWFmdGVyLWFwcGFyZW50LWV4cGxvc2lvbi84MzA4ODgzMDAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Suspected water main break uproots road leaves SW Detroit residents in limbo,"Detroit — A suspected water main break beneath a southwest Detroit marijuana dispensary Saturday caused a 10-foot mound to bubble up in the middle of Dearborn Street and affected nearby gas and electric lines.

An emergency crew will move quickly to demolish the building at the southwest corner of Fort and Dearborn streets because it is ""considered at immediate risk of collapse onto the sidewalk and utility lines"" a press release from the Detroit Department of Public Works said.

After the water main break residents said Fort Street was flooded with a yellowish liquid.

City officials Sunday closed Fort Street between Miller Road and Dearborn Street — a major truck artery — along with sections of other streets. There are no residences within a few hundred yards of the intersection that's across the street from Woodmere Cemetery and near metal scrapyards and other industrial businesses.

About two dozen residents lost power because of the incident city officials said.

The odor of gas still lingered Sunday outside the Stash Provisioning Center dispensary while angry residents complained that nobody in authority told them what happened or whether the fumes were toxic.

The DPW press release issued about 24 hours after the water main break warned residents to stay out of the blocked-off area but there was no mention of the odor.

""DTE reports less than 25 customers are without gas in the area and have gone door-to-door to communicate with residents"" the release said.

The rear of the building that houses the dispensary was raised several feet Sunday while nearby street poles were tilted apparently from the force of the bursting underground water pipe which residents said happened between 8-8:30 p.m. Saturday.

""The Detroit Fire Marshal has identified an emergency contractor to demolish a commercial building at Fort and Dearborn that was heavily damaged due to the underground issues and is considered at immediate risk of collapse onto the sidewalk and utility lines"" the press release said.

Fire Department investigators initially blamed a natural gas leak for the explosion but later determined it was a ""major water event like a broken water main"" Fornell said. ""The investigation continues.""

Multiple dispensary employees were inside the building when the explosion occurred but nobody was hurt said Stash general manager Ashley Babcock.

""You can replace a building and you can replace the product but you can't replace people"" she said.

Babcock and other residents say they've been calling DTE for more than a month to report smelling gas. Three residents said the gas odor was heavier than ever Saturday in the hours leading up to the water main break.

DTE spokeswoman Clare Liening said in a statement: ""“A collaborative investigation is underway by the City of Detroit the Great Lakes Water Authority and DTE Energy.

""At this time there is no evidence to indicate natural gas was the cause of the incident; a natural gas explosion did not occur"" Liening said. ""However parts of DTE's gas and electric infrastructure were impacted by a water main break.""

Babcock said she called DTE ""countless times"" because of the gas scent.

""We’ve had gas leak problems for quite a while"" she said. ""We were really worried about it. Some days it was really strong some days weaker. The DTE crews dug up in front of the building and though they fixed it but the problem kept occurring.""

Residents said they are used to loud noises and ground vibrations from passing trains and factories in the neighborhood that abuts Delray but said were rattled by Saturday's disturbance.

""We would like to know what is going on"" Dearborn Street resident Victor Grenados said. ""There is a really heavy smell of gas and we don't have a lot of water pressure in our house.""

Gary Buchannan who lives on nearby Kaier Street said the gasoline that flooded Dearborn Street ""looked like lemonade"" and the air ""reeks like you stuck your head in a gas can.""

Buchannan said his two children have asthma so they are staying with their grandparents and he is staying home to make sure everything is OK.

Candida Leon who lives on Dearborn Street said the odor is making her nauseous and giving her a headache. She said she's concerned because she has lung problems.

""Nobody has been informed. Nobody has told us anything"" Leon said.

About a half-hour after the city's press release was emailed Leon said she still was in the dark about what happened.

""They said they're going around door-to-door? Nobody came to my door.""

Update: Apparent underground explosion significantly damages Detroit dispensary officials investigating strange odor

As of Sunday afternoon the cause of an odor reported in the area was still unknown. According to the environmental group Southwest Detroit Community Benefits Coalition a “strong smell” was emitted from what it described as an underground explosion.

Michigan State Senator Stephanie Chang of the 1st district is asking residents to be cautious and report anything unusual they smell to the PEAS hotline at 800-292-4706.

Chang added that her office is reaching out to DTE Energy and the Michigan Department of Environment Great Lakes and Energy for information about the source of the odor any potential hazards and whether residents should take precautions.

A statement released by DTE Energy Sunday read “At this time there is no evidence to indicate natural gas was the cause of the incident; a natural gas explosion did not occur. However parts of DTE’s gas and electric infrastructure were impacted by a water main break. DTE personnel are on site to ensure public safety as well as the integrity of the natural gas and electric infrastructure systems.”

The statement continued “Safety for the public and our crews is our top priority. We ask the public for their safety to refrain from entering areas that have been secured by the local authorities and utility companies.”

DTE Energy is also urging residents who smell or suspect a gas leak to leave the area call 911 and the company at 800-947-5000 or your natural gas provider to report the situation."

Carol Lynn Crispino who lives at 760 Kauska Way in the Fruitland Park section of The Villages was driving a brown 2021 Yamaha golf cart at 8:15 p.m. Sept. 4 when a Road Ranger spotted her traveling south on the turnpike near Exit 304.

The New York native was directed to the Okahumpka Service Plaza where she admitted to a trooper from the Florida Highway Patrol that she had “about three drinks with dinner at Brownwood Square in The Villages” the report said. She provided breath samples that registered .150 and .157 blood alcohol content.

In addition to being arrested on a charge of driving under the influence she was issued a $166 ticket for improperly operating a golf cart on the turnpike at night.

She was booked at the Sumter County Detention Center and released after a friend from The Villages posted her $500 bond.

Crispino purchased her home in The Villages in 2017 for $341800. In a form filled out after her arrest Crispino indicated she will be relying on the services of the public defender’s office. The form also showed she collects $2500 in monthly Social Security benefits and $5800 in monthly retirement/pension benefits.

She is due for arraignment in the case Sept. 22 in Sumter County Court.",,,,,,

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size My first trip to Afghanistan was in the winter of 1993. I hid my camera gear in the car as we drove towards the capital Kabul avoiding militia roadblocks by driving fast and tossing thousands of Afghani banknotes out the windows so the soldiers would chase the money and not shoot us. The country was in chaos a legacy of its communist days and nine-year war with the Soviet Union. Different warring factions had divided the city into a serrated maze of frontlines and trenches. I was bunkered down inside the main hospital. The wounded were arriving in droves casualties of the shelling. There’s one photo I recall most the one I chose not to take. I saw a gurney and a child underneath a sheet. I lifted the sheet and to my horror saw no face except one eye. Momentarily turning around I saw the child’s parents looking at me. I gently lay the sheet back over the body. Over 20 years of travelling to Afghanistan I always sought to tell the human stories of Afghans and the attempts by many brave Allied soldiers to build a better life for them after the Taliban tyranny. In 2005 I was embedded with a US Army Psychological Operations Unit in Kandahar. After six weeks of missions with American soldiers my flak jacket and helmet felt like part of my body as we rumbled out of Kandahar Airfield inside a packed Humvee. Above my head AC/DC’s Hell’s Bells was blaring out of a loudspeaker; later it was Rage Against the Machine and even the Star Wars theme. They played the music to annoy their enemy: “It’s the only way we can find the Taliban” my psych-ops guide explained. “Otherwise you just don’t see them.” One marine described it to me: “It’s like chasing ghosts. These shadows pop out of caves and attack you and then they drop their guns and run away.” Two decades after the September 11 attacks the ensuing US invasion and the images of desperation and turmoil at Kabul airport as the heart-wrenching evacuations unfolded I can’t offer any solution to the many problems facing Afghanistan. What I can offer is respect for the beauty and tragedy of the place Afghans call home.

Tajik refugees Saki Camp Northern Afghanistan 1993 During this my first trip to Afghanistan I went to cover a refugee crisis in the north of the country. A civil war in neighbouring Tajikistan had forced tens of thousands to flee to safety with the irony that safety meant living in arctic conditions in a desert of death. It was so cold that I could only take a few frames at a time before I had to stuff my hands deep inside my thermals again. Men were busy digging great big holes in the earth to cover with tents or small ones for the many dead. People huddled around fires cooking and offered me the little food they had. To say they’re hospitable to guests is an understatement. I wandered across the dusty plains like a lost explorer searching for images. The photograph I always go back to is of a wedding ceremony inside the camp. It was the only normal thing I saw that day the only time I saw a smile and heard a laugh.

Credit: Stephen Dupont Northern Alliance soldier Bagram 1998 Covering the civil war between the Northern Alliance and the Taliban in late 1998 I met a soldier inside a bombed-out ruin along a frontline near Bagram Airfield just north of the capital. It was his shell-shocked gaze that struck me first but then I saw his prosthetic arms. He told me his story which encapsulates the absurdity of war: “I was not a soldier before. I used to work for an international non-government organisation trying to rid the country of landmines. One day I was de-mining when one blew off my arms – a mine planted by the Taliban. It was then that I decided to join the Northern Alliance and learnt to shoot an AK-47 with my new arms so I could take my revenge.”

Orphanage Kabul 1995 I was invited inside an orphanage for a photographic project about the children of Kabul and how they were affected by the war. Housed inside a Soviet-era apartment block on the outskirts of the city were hundreds of young war orphans.

A young boy is caressed by an elderly man whom I assume is his father. I’m drawn to the sad tragedy of the scene; the shaft of light that crosses the child’s face seems almost biblical to me. The man says the Americans shot the boy; it’s impossible to know. It was the same day that I took photographs of US soldiers burning the bodies of two dead Taliban soldiers which became international news and eventually led to changed US military policy. But it’s the picture of this child that I think about more – maybe because I’m a father too. It’s a sad reality that innocent children too often become the victims of these adult war games.

But Tom O'Neil remembers more than most.

O'Neil knew someone a relative and a North Iowa resident who was a pilot at the time. The morning of Sept. 11 2001 a flight the relative piloted departed San Francisco. Shortly after news hit that the United Airlines Flight 11 had struck the World Trade Center in New York City.

Because of airline policies on employees offering media commentary the Globe is not identifying the pilot or the airline for which he works.

O'Neil recalls sitting at work when he heard the news and the immediate sense of panic he felt.

""I have no issue saying I was scared"" O'Neil said. ""My biggest concern was for (him).""

Tom and the rest of his family were now left in the dark.

""We knew he was leaving from San Francisco but nobody knew what flights were involved"" said O'Neil. ""It wasn't until the afternoon that we finally heard from him... It was awhile before we knew he was OK.""

Those moments made an already horrific situation even worse for O'Neil and his family as he remembers how slowly time went by waiting for news about his relative.

The impact of the Sept. 11 attacks hit the O'Neil family almost immediately as the pilot had to return his flight to San Francisco and was stuck there for over a week far from his wife and children and parents and siblings in North Iowa.

Eventually the pilot was furloughed from his job and it took months for him to return to aviation.

The events from that day prompted Tom O'Neil and the pilot to visit Ground Zero together when visiting New York City in 2002.

""This was our generation's Pearl Harbor"" O'Neil said as a reason for visiting the memorial. ""I hope for generations nobody has to feel that way ever again.""

O'Neil remembers nearly two decades later just how emotional and surreal it was to be there just a year after the attacks especially since they were there just a year prior in 2001 before the attacks.

""It was a very very somber scene"" O'Neil said. ""There was the sound of construction and dump trucks it was an eerie feeling.""

Now 20 years after the attack O'Neil thinks that day has opened his eyes and made him more appreciative of the country he lives in and the realities of life.

""I think it's a good reminder of how quickly things can change"" O'Neil said. ""More than anything it emboldened me to have pride in our country.""

(WWJ) -- While some Michiganders were heading out for football games at the Big House and Spartan Stadium on Saturday others were fired up for a different kind of contest.

The Mullet Superbowl.

Al Durham of Guy With A Mullet Landscaping hosted the first ever Mullet Superbowl on Saturday at the Eagle Park Fairgrounds just west of Lansing.

The contest was part of the Eagle Days celebration held annually the weekend after Labor Day. Durham says the event will become an annual celebration of mullets during Eagle Days.

i promised a party and that’s exactly what it was. thank you WILX News 10 for all the coverage this week you guys rock.... Posted by Guy With A Mullet Landscaping on Sunday September 12 2021

The winner Garrison Rogers walked away with the grand prize of a Yeti Cooler and a case of Busch Light while the participants in the kids’ age group got bluetooth speakers and cookies.

“I think everybody should try a mullet at least once in their life” Durham told WILX in Lansing. “It’s a door-opening experience.”

Durham tells WWJ the Mullet Superbowl brought more people to the Eagle Days beer tent than he’s seen in 20 years -- they ran out of beer and had to go get more.

Durham started Guy With A Mullet Landscaping as a side project to save enough money to buy a Harley Davidson motorcycle but business skyrocketed after his mullet photoshoot went viral online --even leading to a calendar fans could purchase -- and he made it his full-time job.

He says he got the idea to bring the mullet contest to Eagle Days after he was asked to judge the Eaton County Mullet Contest.

“I had a blast and I wanted to have my own at Eagle Days because I grew up coming to Eagle Days. So it was great to bring it back home” Durham said.

In Sheehan’s mind it was Planet of the Apes all over again referring to the 1968 film.

“I can’t even describe what I saw (that day) and saw days after” said Sheehan a Fort Collins resident who was a 43-year-old in his 17th year with the New York City Fire Department in 2001. “The first day I was there it was daylight and the dust kicked up and paper was coming down. I picked up a piece of paper turned it over and it was a picture of a guy’s family and I was done.”

Sheehan now 63 and retired since 2003 wasn’t done that day. A member of Engine 236 in east New York he pressed on — spending the next six months with shifts at ground zero including 24 hours on and a day off for about two weeks after Sept. 11.

“With the recovery stage all you’re doing is picking up pieces of victims’ remains and I’ll never forgot the smell” he said.

The Sept. 11 terrorist attacks were the worst ever against the U.S. Al-Qaeda an international Islamist extremist group founded by Osama bin Laden and based in Afghanistan plotted and carried out the operation. They hijacked the airplanes and hit the World Trade Center’s Twin Towers and the Pentagon. Another plane meant for Washington D.C. crashed in a field in western Pennsylvania after passengers thwarted the hijackers’ plans.

Nearly 3000 people from 93 nations died in the attacks. About 2800 were in New York and 343 of those were from the fire department. Another 184 died at the Pentagon and 40 were killed on hijacked United Airlines Flight 93 when it crashed near Shanksville Pennsylvania.

Twenty years later Sept. 11 remains a solemn and difficult day for many including Sheehan and Eaton Mayor Scott Moser a mortuary and funeral services professional. Moser was in New York by late September 2001 to assist with post-mortem processes.

What’s different 20 years is the attitude of a nation that endured an immense level of fear shock pain and uncertainty — not only on Sept. 11 but in the weeks and months that followed the attacks. The U.S. was united and stronger during that time Sheehan and Moser said. While the memories of Sept. 11 remain fresh to the men the day also feels long in the past given the division in the U.S.

“It feels to me like we’ve forgotten how unified we were at that time” said Moser who spent 32 days in New York after Sept. 11. “I wish we could remember how everyone came together.”

University of Northern Colorado sociology professor Kyle Anne Nelson said the day marked the start of “a big shift” in the U.S. and while many may yearn for a return to a national sense of unity and camaraderie it’s difficult to expect our country to be the same as it was 20 years ago. Increased security measures took effect quickly after and the rise of social media has drastically altered attitudes and views and how we receive and consume information.

While there was national unity following the attacks there was another “almost immediate” effect.

“It also sparked massive Islamophobia and racism and vilification of Muslims and people who did not seem like Americans” Nelson added. “It was almost immediate the hate.”

DMORT: ‘Trying to do your part’

The owner of Moser Funeral and Cremation Service in Evans Moser 56 was in New York working as a contractor with the federal Disaster Mortuary Operational Response Team (DMORT).

The 10 DMORTs nationwide are organized by region under the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ National Disaster Medical System and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

A spokesperson with the HHS wrote via email the DMORT teams were dispatched to New York and Washington D.C. areas following the attack. Another team was sent to Somerset County Pennsylvania.

The DMORT teams were comprised of several hundred personnel including coroners funeral directors mortuary officers medical examiners different forensic specialists dental assistants autopsy assistants fingerprint specialists and administrative workers.

“At each location the team worked with the local medical examiner’s office to recover bodies from the debris; track and document human remains and personal effects…and prepare process and return human remains and/or personal effects to the appropriate recipients” HHS said.

The DMORT members work disaster sites with mass fatalities: following Sept. 11 after a natural disaster such as a hurricane or tornado or an airline crash. The members respond to help the local authorities manage the scene.

Moser has also been deployed to respond after Hurricane Katrina a tornado in Joplin Missouri and a commercial airline crash in Guam. He returned to New York last year to participate in the city’s COVID-19 pandemic response.

The work can be difficult to handle even for the trained professionals with DMORT who respond to the mass-fatality incidents.

“I think anyone who went there one of two things happened” Moser said of post-Sept. 11. “They’d say ‘I’m never going to do this again.’ Or they say ‘If I don’t go there and be strong for these people the hundreds of others there doing what we’re doing this won’t get resolved. It won’t get fixed.’ You’re trying to do your part.”

The roots of the organization date to the late 1980s. One of the founders was Morgan County Coroner Don Heer. The organizers wanted to eliminate politics or any perception of wrongdoing from getting into the post-event management according to Heer. Airline insurance companies also wanted to know the recovery work was being done correctly and properly and they wanted consistency with the response.

Heer 73 recently retired from DMORT.

“It’s hard work and long hours” he said. “It’s people who are accustomed to working with dead bodies and bodies mutilated because of a traumatic event.

He was involved with response teams on a Korean Airlines crash in Guam the Oklahoma City bombing an Egyptian Airline crash off the coast of Rhode Island Hurricanes Rita and Katrina in the southeast U.S. and on the tornado in Joplin Missouri.

Heer was in New York for two weeks after Sept. 11 working as a night-shift manager at a medical examiner’s office.

“There were military personnel guarding everything because of what was going on at the time and the attitude of — especially New York City and the entire nation — of being violated” he said. “There was pride in being an American and a patriotism being involved.”

Moser arrived in New York about two weeks after Sept. 11 to begin his DMORT work. He and his colleagues were transported to ground zero soon after getting into the city to see the area and “get it out of our systems.”

Moser now with 25 years as a DMORT member recalled being nervous about the scene in New York as they neared the area where the towers once stood.

“I turned the corner to see and it’s indescribable” Moser said. “It was this giant monster of a pile that you never could’ve imagined you know? I remember catching myself: my hands were shaking and being afraid for humanity maybe because you don’t know what’s going to happen.”

Neither Moser nor his DMORT colleagues spent time at ground zero in their post-event duties. They worked out of a temporary morgue about one block away at a city medical examiner’s office or in other locations serving as staging areas headquarters or command centers.

At the medical examiner’s office Moser assisted doctors with post-mortem examinations in a first step to identifying victims. Later he learned how to take DNA samples. Moser also filled in as the DMORT representative at the multi-agency command center.

During his last week in New York Moser was asked to work with a New York City Police Department detective as liaisons with other agencies to assist in recovery efforts.

Trying to identify nearly 3000 people two of whom were only identified this week through DNA technology can appear to be an overwhelming task. Moser said identifying victims on the planes was a controlled environment because airlines have passenger lists.

It was impossible to know with certainty on victims in the towers. Moser and the DMORT workers received victims’ names and communication was maintained with families to find dental records and DNA from personal items such as a toothbrush hairbrush or comb. In other cases the DMORT teams will use X-rays to make a positive identification.

Moser didn’t interact with families during his work after Sept. 11. He has worked with families after other disasters. DMORT uses comprehensive questionnaires from families to find victim information such as age race hair color skin color height and scars. The questionnaire also requests what kind of clothes shoes or jewelry the victim might have been wearing. Did they have tattoos? Information is entered into databases so the DMORT professionals can keep track of their work.

Moser said in New York they likely relied on DNA and dental records to identify victims.

“Family X brings in everything because it’s been five days and we haven’t heard from them” Moser said. “He was probably in there. We’re taking DNA samples and all of sudden we have a hit.”

Moser said he thinks about Sept. 11 as the date draws closer each year. Generally he finds himself thinking about the day and that time less and less. He has a book in his office he pages through every so often and he’ll watch a documentary.

“They’re interesting to me” he said. “Wherever we were wherever we’d go they’d be posting these signs (requesting help finding victims). That was one of the saddest things I think. If you look back people made them themselves: picture name height weight. And please call this number if you find her or him.”

‘It was a very bad time in America’s life’

One of Sheehan’s toughest days after 9/11 came when crews found the body one of his fire department shiftmates Billy Mahoney. Sheehan said he knew 50 firefighters who died in the attacks and 25 of those were close friends. Mahoney and Sheehan often carpooled together to the station from their homes on Long Island. They were friends through work but the relationship extended beyond the fire station.

“They couldn’t get to him and had to dig a tunnel” Sheehan said. “He was in an elevator with five others. They found him and his wife could have a service with Billy present.”

Sheehan and his wife Debra are both native New Yorkers. Debra and a friend visited Colorado in the 1970s and Debra loved it. Kevin was thinking about retirement in 2001 and the couple narrowed their retirement destinations to North Carolina or Colorado. They relocated to Fort Collins in 2006.

The Sheehans have four adult children two daughters and two sons from 37 to 27 years old. Three of the children are in Colorado. One of their sons is with the FDNY on Engine 248 in Brooklyn.

“I was there for rescue and recovery and saw things no one should hope to see and especially my son” Sheehan said. “He went into it on his own.”

The Sheehans drove out to Colorado for vacation in 2001 and returned home not long before Sept. 11. Debra Sheehan’s father died a week before and her sister died early in the morning on Sept. 11 after an illness.

With the deaths in his family Sheehan wasn’t working on Sept. 11. He said he knew it was terrorism with report of the first plane hitting the North Tower before 9 a.m. Sheehan was on duty in late February 1993 when a smaller group of terrorists attacked the World Trade Center. He said the fire department knew the city would be attacked again but many suspected it could be a chemical bomb in a subway or another heavily populated site.

Sheehan and his wife heard of his sister-in-law’s death after the second plane hit the South Tower and he remained home until Sept. 13.

“I have guilt to this day that I wasn’t there on the 11th” Sheehan said. “I had to get to the firehouse.”

Rocky relationships with members of Sheehan’s family left him disconnected from relatives. No one from his family called for a while to check on him after the attacks. He eventually heard from an aunt. The stress and trauma continued to build like a snowball Sheehan said until finally he went for counseling. He continues to use help when he needs it a “spirit lifting.” He now relies on fly fishing and Debra whom Sheehan calls “my angel and foundation.”

“It was such a bad time” he said. “It was a very bad time in America’s life.”

Sheehan said he finds the reminders of Sept. 11 difficult though he said it helps to talk about his experiences. He can’t watch documentaries like Moser.

“It never ends and it’s like losing a family member and I think this is a little worse than losing a family member” he said.

Sheehan said it’s a challenge to deal with remembrance of the day this year because he agreed with Moser: the U.S. has changed. The “togetherness” is lost Sheehan said.

Nelson the UNC professor said the changes for Americans since Sept. 11 have been significant. There was a loss of innocence with an attack on civilians — regular people living their lives traveling on a plane or going to work.

As a result of Sept. 11 Americans noticed changes in security measures in their lives at sporting events and stadiums and most obviously at airports.

Though the country went through a large domestic terrorism event with the Oklahoma City bombing that killed 168 in a federal building in 1995 Sept. 11 was a higher profile event with the epicenter in New York and Washington D.C. Nelson said the terrorism that day “opened a Pandora’s Box on random attacks.”

“Whatever delusion we had being safe and disconnected that all eroded on 9/11” Nelson said. “It won’t be the same. This was pre-Facebook and Twitter and we didn’t process Sept. 11 the way we would now. I had optimism about national unity but then came the pandemic and that hasn’t brought us together.”"

The quid in question was missing the usual silver-coloured middle and instead had a gold colour all over.

The seller explained in the listing description that they 'work in a pub and got this in some change'.

Advert

But the punter who handed it over may regret doing so because after 24 bids from five different bidders the rare £1 sold on the online auctioning site on 8 August for more than £200.

eBay

It seems pretty amazing that people are willing to spend £205 on one dodgy pound but there ya go that's coin collectors I suppose. More money than sense.

As you can probably imagine the Royal Mint churns out tonnes of dosh so it is inevitable that mistakes occur from time to time - and they can be quite lucrative if you can spot them.



Advert

Last February for example someone made £111 from their 'fried egg' quid in which the silver-coloured part of the coin sat slightly off-centre overlapping the golden-coloured ring around the edge.

Kind of like an inverse fried egg really given the edge's colour is more yolky and the centre more albumeny.

As well as dodgy coins limited edition ones can of course be valuable too.

PA

Last July a 50p coin minted to mark the 250th anniversary of Kew Gardens brought in £200 on eBay.

Advert

The limited edited coin has been hot stuff for currency collectors since its issue often topping rare coin indexes.

Money experts at ChangeChecker said just 210000 of the coins had been minted compared to a standard minting of around five million.

The site said: ""It's estimated that just 1 in 300 people are likely to come across the Kew Gardens.

""When you compare its scarcity to the average 5 million coins per design usually issued into circulation you start to really understand just how rare this coin is.""



Advert

Issued in 2009 the coin was designed by Christopher Le Brun and it shows the gardens' pagoda encircled by a vine along with the dates 1759 and 2009 and the word 'Kew' at the base of the structure.

Anyway a more pressing currency matter affecting us all concerns £20 notes.

A new polymer note was issued last February and we will no longer be able to use the old paper version from 30 September next year - the same goes for paper £50 notes if you've ever been lucky enough to have one of those babies.

So keep your eyes on your cash folks.

The Z28 obviously remained the rarest version though its production increased as well so for the model year 1969 Chevrolet equipped more than 20000 cars with this package.The Camaro that we have here however comes with a series of questionable changes that could make some people walk away though at closer inspection it’s still a solid candidate for a restomod if you don’t mind the occasional rust and the holes in the body.First and foremost in case you’re wondering why the Camaro is covered in primer there’s a very simple explanation for this. While this doesn’t make much sense eBay seller cncmillguy says a previous owner installed a new left fender and because they wanted to have the same color as the rest of the car they used primer on the entire body. So they didn’t want to paint just the new fender but the entire vehicle.As for all the rust you see in the photos there’s a good reason for this one too. The car spent over 3 decades in a barn before being moved outside where it was supposed to get a second chance.

A MUM has revealed how she managed to turn the box room into an adorable bedroom for her son – complete with his own secret play area.

Charlotte Greedy 27 wanted to give her four-year-old son Brody an amazing bedroom but was limited with the space she could work with.

Charlotte from Wales said: “I moved into my forever home in October 2020 and I really stressed about the box room as it wasn’t a suitable size for a small child who could sleep and also play in his room.”

In a bid to maximise space she scoured bargain shops such as Argos Ikea and eBay for clever finds to make the most of the room.

The mum-of-two managed to fit a bed storage and a secret play area into the tiny room spending around £240 on the project.

Charlotte who documents her family life on Instagram told LatestDeals.co.uk: “I came up with the idea of buying a mid-sleeper which I found in Argos that cost £160.

""I then bought a Kallax cube from IKEA which cost £25.

""The Drona boxes were also from IKEA which were £3 each then I bought personalised wooden words off eBay and superglued them onto the boxes to make an organised toy storage unit that I slotted underneath the bed!”

She was chuffed with her handiwork adding Brody was over the moon with his new room.

Charlotte said: “My youngest now has a den and toy storage unit under his bed which he can play under.

“He absolutely loves it and the words on the boxes show him which storage box to put his toys in.

""He’s now four and is learning to read and understands which box his toys go into by looking at the words. I also think it teaches him to tidy up!

""I never expected the room to meet my expectations but it's done that and more and I'm so pleased with the space I’ve created.

""Brody loves his room; he was so excited to see it transformed.”

She advised anyone who was looking to get the most out of a box room to invest in a mid-sleeper as you can fit tons of storage underneath.

Charlotte added: “It’s opened the tiny room up loads as you can see!”

Tom Church co-founder of LatestDeals.co.uk said: “Playing with heights and textures is a great way to create interest and maximise the use of a small room.

“The mid-sleeper is such a popular style for younger kids and it’s easy to see why - Brody’s room is seriously cool.”

While this mum made an incredible playhouse under the stairs for her daughter using bits from Homebase and eBay.

Meanwhile this dad created a man cave under his stairs which other people have branded ""genius"".

Plus this woman's dirty rug now looks brand new after she shampooed it and people are calling it a total gamechanger."

The brief development update follows a livestream that gave fans an early look at work in progress.

Over on Reddit EA Motive provided another brief work-in-progress clip showing some of the ways its team is giving Ishimura a “worn” look. Check out the clip below.

EA Motive has said that it will go through all the feedback and suggestions that it received following the livestream and will continue to read them. The team plans to shape the remake based on feedback where possible.

The letter reads:

It was important to us to give you an early look at what we’ve been working on so you could tell us your thoughts. We’ll continue reading your feedback and what your expectations are for the remake of Dead Space. Everything we showed was a work in progress which means that we’ll be working on things like Isaac’s suit the aesthetic and ambiance of the Ishimura. We’re doing work to ensure it has the right level of wear and tear. For example here is an early work in progress clip showing some of the ways that the team is going to be giving that worn look to the Ishimura. We’re going to be heads down now working on the game taking some time to review all the thoughts theories and suggestions you’ve all shared with us. We look forward to showing you how you’ve helped shape the game next year when we’re further in development!

The game took place during the early days of the Afghanistan invasion and placed you in the shoes of a special operator destined to save the world! Okay it wasn’t a Tom Clancy game but it did deviate into the world of spies and black operations. Input from guys like former Delta operative Larry Vickers added a level of realism.

I played this game to death and when I was a Marine my squad leader happened to be one of the many who had advised on the game’s creation.

Marines from 3/1 fresh out of Fallujah and Operation Phantom Fury  advised Destineer studios on the game. They helped craft a realistic experience for Xbox and PC. The creators made a game in which smart decision-making was rewarded.

I loved this game as a kid. As someone who wanted to be a Marine this game put me in the shoes of a fireteam leader armed with an M16A4 an Acog and an M203 and let me fight a fictional war in Lebanon. I ordered my teammates set suppressive fire and dropped grenades and three-round bursts on tons of bad guys. It wasn’t a crazy video game involving fighting for nuclear weapon codes. It was just a game about a lance corporal on the ground doing his job.

So today we’ve gathered five of the crazy video games that veterans have had direct input on.

Having come a long way since Duck Hunt and Tetris  video games have grown into a multi-billion dollar industry. Video games depict a wide variety of worlds and many of them try to replicate real life. Video games can make you a criminal cop chef guerilla and of course a soldier. Some of these crazy video games can be realistic. Others can be more silly and fun. Video game makers aren’t stupid and when they design a realistic video game they often consult with experts in the field. Given the popularity of military video games creators rightly consult with the men who’ve been there and done that.

Video game makers aren’t stupid and when they design a realistic video game they often consult with experts in the field. Given the popularity of military video games creators rightly consult with the men who’ve been there and done that.

So today we’ve gathered five of the crazy video games that veterans have had direct input on.

1) Close Combat – First to Fight

I loved this game as a kid. As someone who wanted to be a Marine this game put me in the shoes of a fireteam leader armed with an M16A4 an Acog and an M203 and let me fight a fictional war in Lebanon. I ordered my teammates set suppressive fire and dropped grenades and three-round bursts on tons of bad guys. It wasn’t a crazy video game involving fighting for nuclear weapon codes. It was just a game about a lance corporal on the ground doing his job.

Marines from 3/1 fresh out of Fallujah and Operation Phantom Fury advised Destineer studios on the game. They helped craft a realistic experience for Xbox and PC. The creators made a game in which smart decision-making was rewarded.

I played this game to death and when I was a Marine my squad leader happened to be one of the many who had advised on the game’s creation.

2) Medal of Honor Warfighter

Medal of Honor Warfighter was a sequel to the Medal of Honor series’ reboot. The game took place during the early days of the Afghanistan invasion and placed you in the shoes of a special operator destined to save the world! Okay it wasn’t a Tom Clancy game but it did deviate into the world of spies and black operations. Input from guys like former Delta operative Larry Vickers added a level of realism.

Sometimes the military consents and allows troops to advise and provide input into a video game. However sometimes people go a little rogue and that’s exactly what seven SEAL Team Six operators did. They advised on the creation of the game and revealed some classified equipment to the developers. This lead to punitive measures being taken against the SEALs.

3) America’s Army

America’s Army and its various sequels are an easy inclusion. These games aimed to realistically show military life and experiences. They would be a recruiting tool and therefore were distributed for free through various platforms. The games put the player in the virtual shoes of numerous jobs. From an infantryman to a sniper and machine gunner to a special operative the player had many options.

When the Army makes a game you’ll surely see the input of a wide variety of veterans to help make the game educational and realistic.

America’s Army and its numerous sequels aren’t crazy video games because of how they play; it’s just crazy that the U.S. Army made a video game in the first place.

4) Full Spectrum Warrior

Another game from my childhood. Unlike most of the video games on this list Full Spectrum Warrior isn’t a first-person shooter but a strategy game. It put you in the role of a squad leader commanding two teams with a total of eight men. You have to lay down suppressive fire utilize your grenades wisely and use cover. The game rewards smart decisions and punishes poor ones harshly.

Full Spectrum Warrior was a joint project with the U.S. Army. The Army didn’t want a game to boost recruiting efforts but to be a training device. Full Spectrum Warrior allowed soldiers to practice decision-making and using proper squad tactics. Soldiers from the Army helped develop the game realistically with proper equipment tactics and maneuvers being key.

5) Call of Duty Games

The Call of Duty series includes tons of games ranging from World War II shooters to futuristic affairs with soldiers wearing exoskeletons and running along walls. The series’s entries are a mixed bag and it’s hard to see where vets could have had some input but you’d be surprised. In games like Black Ops 2 the story and setting came from the stories of Oliver North as told to game developers.

In the game Modern Warfare (2019) and Warzone the makers teamed up with vets like Tu Lam for motion capturing. They wanted to get the real feel of the weapons and tactics so they went to the source. Heck they even used SEALs Marines and Spetznaz troops to get it just right.

Video Games and Veterans

I remember a great many times in the barracks where we would all load up the latest Battlefield game and teamed up to either win gloriously or fail miserably. The modern warfighter is also likely a gamer in his spare time and it’s no surprise to see so many veterans and even active-duty servicemembers tasked with providing input on the latest generation of crazy video games.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbmRpYXRvZGF5LmluL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvbmV3cy9zdG9yeS9iYXR0bGVmaWVsZC1tb2JpbGUtdG8tYmUtYXZhaWxhYmxlLWluLWJldGEtZm9yLWFuZHJvaWQtdXNlcnMtdGhpcy1mYWxsLTE4NTE5NzQtMjAyMS0wOS0xMtIBjQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbmRpYXRvZGF5LmluL2FtcC90ZWNobm9sb2d5L25ld3Mvc3RvcnkvYmF0dGxlZmllbGQtbW9iaWxlLXRvLWJlLWF2YWlsYWJsZS1pbi1iZXRhLWZvci1hbmRyb2lkLXVzZXJzLXRoaXMtZmFsbC0xODUxOTc0LTIwMjEtMDktMTI?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Battlefield Mobile to be available in beta for Android users this fall,"Electronic Arts (EA) the company behind popular video game titles like Fifa Need for Speed Sims Battlefield Medal of Honour etc. EA has been working on a standalone mobile version of its popular Battlefield games it plans to release sometime in 2022. This week the publisher shared new details on the upcoming title.

EA plans to begin beta testing Battlefield Mobile this fall with “a series of smaller playtests"" involving players in Indonesia and the Philippines who own Android devices. “As we continue with testing we’ll expand the size of these tests add new regions” the company said over on its community website.

EA says there will be a limited number of slots available for those who want to beta test the mobile game meaning you won’t necessarily be given access even if you pre-register.

Battlefield Mobile will come from DICE and Industrial Toys. The developer promised an entirely new Battlefield game built from the ground up that will be playable on smartphones and tablets. Players can expect a “fully-fledged skill-based experience” EA said back in April with the title’s initial announcement.

According to the Battlefield Mobile page in Google PlayStore “It boasts “your favourite FPS combat superior team play and genre-defining destruction.” As mentioned on the website Battlefield veterans will both find new maps and modes in the game. Further players will be able to create an array of “game-changing gadgets and authentic weapons.”

However to begin the Battlefield Mobile beta will only feature the Grand Bazaar map and the solo conquest game mode. EA confirmed that more information about maps and game modes will be shared closer to the full launch which is still unknown. They did confirm that cross-play will not be available as Battlefield Mobile is being “built specifically for mobile.”

If you are wondering if Battlefield Mobile would feature cross-play across console and PC versions the answer is no. Since the game is built for mobile it will not support cross-play with its console and PC counterparts.

The beta Android test is by invite only and will be on a first-come first-serve basis. The game will require an Internet connection and will be free to play with in-game purchases for Battle Passes and cosmetics. The beta will require devices to run at least Android 7 with EA noting that the game is being optimised to run well on various devices."

“What is happening with chemistry in America?” queries Matthew D. Hall a biology group leader at the US National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) in a Twitter post July 8. “We’re losing postdocs to pharma after less than 1 year in our med chem labs. Is the job market that hot in chemistry?”

The answer in short is yes.

The combination of a healthy drug industry heavy venture capital investment in start-ups and new targets for small-molecule drugs is spurring a hiring spree allowing some young PhD chemists particularly in medicinal and computational chemistry to skip the traditional years of postdoctoral training and go quickly to work in the pharmaceutical industry. The boom is great for chemists looking to start their careers but it is raising questions about the role of the postdoc in the training of chemists today.

Hall says he was prompted to start a conversation on Twitter after hearing multiple accounts of principal investigators in academic labs losing postdocs to industry. “And not in a scenario where they have done a 2- or 3-year postdoc but 4 to 6 months in. I’m 44. I did a very long postdoc. I have a lot of friends who did two postdocs. That was not uncommon at all. Obviously the opportunities are there now in a way they haven’t been for a while.”

Hall adds that it has become increasingly difficult to fill postdoc spots in his lab at NCATS. “I have chatted with a few people who applied for postdocs who basically said ‘I’m not doing a postdoc. I have a job with pharma.’ ”

This is a troubling development Hall says given the traditional role of postdoctoral programs in training PhD-level chemists in medicinal chemistry.

Keep in mind this is exactly what our field wants to see. I love to see this type of job environment for young scientists. Joel Schneider chief of chemical biology National Cancer Institute

Most PhD programs give a student a solid grounding in areas such as organic synthesis mechanistic organic chemistry and natural product chemistry Hall says. “Medicinal chemistry requires you to acquire an understanding of how to work in a team how to speak biology how to speak modeling. How to be project-managed and how to look at and understand biological data that informs decisions that are made about the direction a chemistry program is going in. Some people get this at the PhD level but not many.”

Joel P. Schneider the chief of chemical biology at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) agrees that a postdoc fellowship provides a path from the classical chemistry learned during a PhD program to the practical realm of medicinal chemistry as conducted in industrial drug discovery. The NCI which like NCATS is part of the US National Institutes of Health provides an ideal setting he says.

“When a fellow joins a particular lab at the NCI that fellow is really joining all the labs at the NCI. There is a very fluid environment” Schneider says.

While the labs at the NCI have not taken much of a hit Schneider says some fellows have moved into industry before their postdoc is over. He speaks of one former fellow who left for a job with a biotechnology company. She was subsequently hired by a firm involved with crop science and then by a top 10 pharmaceutical company. “This happened in a year and a half” he says.

Bill Wuest a chemistry professor at Emory University says the hot job market in pharmaceutical chemistry contrasts with a dearth of jobs in academia. And even some of those who have jobs in academia are making a move.

“I’ve seen quite a few people in the last 2 to 3 years leave tenured positions for industry jobs” he says. The potential for a higher salary without having to juggle teaching remotely keeping grants afloat and caring for family during a pandemic has a lot of people looking at where their research aligns with industry Wuest says.

Wuest says his thinking about postdocs has evolved in recent years. Traditionally fellowships gave young chemists an experience in a new lab preparing them for jobs largely in academia he says. It has become less clear what a postdoc offers a chemist who wants to pursue a job in industry.

Opportunities in biotech

Biotech companies are in the midst of a hiring surge fueled by sizable rounds of venture capital financing new contracts with Big Pharma partners and initial public stock offerings. But much of their chemistry is outsourced meaning that in-house chemists are involved at the design level and generally manage contract researchers who do the actual synthesis.

Some companies are looking for chemists with 3–5 years of industry experience. But this requirement doesn’t necessarily rule out recent graduates or postdoctoral fellows. Rachel Meyers chief scientific officer at Faze Medicines a Cambridge Massachusetts–based start-up that is targeting biomolecular condensates with small molecules questions the meaning of experience in areas of cutting-edge science.

Money for jobs



“Some of the targets we are working on are not fully understood and have never been drugged before” she says. “There are few people in our industry that have experience drugging biomolecular condensates.”

While the four full-time chemists at Faze had all worked in industry before joining the company it is not requiring industry experience of new hires Meyers says.

“Of course we are talking to the new folks all the time” she says. “By definition the person we need has to be unafraid to be at the cutting edge of interesting biology to bring a really broad tool kit of ideas strategy and creativity to the problem of making drugs. Sometimes it’s the new folks who don’t know how to be afraid.”

Jnana Therapeutics a 4-year-old Boston biotech company with a chemoproteomics platform for drug discovery recently completed a round of financing and is looking to hire synthetic medicinal chemists this year and next.

“Last year we started in earnest to hire PhDs early in their career” says Joel Barrish cofounder and chief scientific officer at the company. “We hired a couple at the end of last year when we first noted the hot job market—that we had to be on the ball and use our networks to find really good-quality people which we did.”

Barrish says the steady influx of venture capital into biotech is fueling job creation. “But I think it’s more than that” he says. “I think there is a renaissance in small-molecule drug discovery.”

For others a renaissance favors the highly skilled and most experienced. Joshua Horan vice president of discovery chemistry at Nuvalent a structure-based drug discovery specialist in Cambridge Massachusetts says the company which outsources all its wet chemistry has one position open which requires 5 years of prior industry research.

“We are seeing a number of people still in postdocs applying for this position. I guess the hope is that the market is very hot that they have a chance” Horan says. “This is something I haven’t really seen before.”

He speculates that more surprises may be in store if the job market remains tight. “If there are not enough people compared to the positions available I think industry would have no choice other than to lower requirements and train people. As of today that is not the model but it would not be a huge barrier if we had to do that.”

Contract development and manufacturing organizations (CDMOs) are also hiring at a record level. TCG GreenChem a CDMO beginning operations at a site in New Jersey has 32 chemists working in its labs and plans to grow the chemistry staff to 60 by year’s end.

“I’m receiving 400 to 500 résumés a week” CEO Chris Senanayake says. “My group is mainly PhDs but we are looking at people with master’s degrees and industry experience.”

Senanayake sees the CDMO sector as a good training ground for emerging chemists. “Our company is small enough for someone to learn the subject matter very fast” he says. “In 3 years they are at the level of 6 or 7 years at a pharmaceutical company.”

Luiza Bondila who received her PhD in supramolecular chemistry in 2019 from the University of Oxford says she was unsure what she wanted to do next but was leaning toward a career in academia. “As my PhD was nearing the end I applied to a couple of postdocs in western Europe” she says. “I had a couple of interviews but didn’t hear back.”

While waiting she was contacted by a recruiter on behalf of Sterling Pharma Solutions a CDMO in England. “I sent my CV and they invited me for an interview” she says. “The response was positive and they gave me an offer.”

Bondila says that when she weighed the advantages offered by industry she liked what she saw as a better work-life balance than afforded by an academic position involving teaching and research. On the other hand the deadlines in industry are tighter. Overall she says her experience so far has disabused her of what she believes are common career-choice misconceptions among PhD students.

“I think a lot of young chemists don’t have a good enough overview of what industry means” she says. Some view a job in industry as selling out. “They see it as not as much of an intellectual pursuit—going for the money for a job that is not as satisfying. But seeing it as less intellectual is a stretch. There are a lot of things involved in scaling up a process that you have to think about that you wouldn’t think about in academia.”

Justin Shapiro who completed his PhD in organic chemistry at Washington University in St. Louis in 2017 before a postdoc at Emory has also vacillated between academia and industry.

“When I first started my postdoc I was pretty dead set on industry” he says. “But early on I had some opportunities to get involved in teaching and mentorship as well as grant writing.” He enjoyed the academic sphere enough that he began considering it for a career.

I applied for 52 faculty positions and got three interviews. I only sent out seven résumés to industry and I got four interviews and three job offers. Jackson Cahn senior scientist Merck & Co.

Shapiro assembled his application materials and fired them off to a handful of universities. “It’s a long process” he says. “And while I was waiting a couple of industry interview opportunities came up. Before I knew it I had industry offers in hand and had to think about what I wanted to do with my career. Ultimately industry was the right route for me.”

He ended up taking a job at Circle Pharma a macrocyclic peptide drug discovery company in San Francisco where he works on solution-phase synthesis with about a dozen chemists. Several are PhDs and some have master’s and bachelor’s degrees. Some came directly to work for Circle after finishing their degrees. Some had industry experience before joining the company.

“All my coworkers have been incredibly smart and nice and capable and have brought me on board very quickly” Shapiro says. He says he’s not sure whether the unexpected number of industry job opportunities ultimately influenced his career choice but as he landed interviews he realized that he was headed where he wanted to be. “What I really wanted out of my career is to work in the drug discovery space gain medicinal chemistry experience and stay in the laboratory.”

Things also moved quickly for Josh Born who received his PhD in organic synthesis from Purdue University in 2020 and now works as a research scientist at Eli Lilly and Company. In between he spent a year in a postdoctoral fellowship at NCATS leaving earlier than he’d planned.

Born says that as a classically trained synthetic chemist he viewed his postdoc as an important step toward a job in the pharmaceutical industry. “I wasn’t necessarily privy to all the biological aspects of medicinal chemistry such as assay development and how large an impact it can have on a small-molecule drug program” he says.

“My goal was to get this kind of experience and use it in applying to the job market” he says. “My timeline when I first got there was a typical postdoc 2 to 4 years.”

Nonetheless Born began hearing from recruiters and responding to job postings. He applied to the job at Lilly which he saw listed online. It was outside his research field but in “an area I was very interested in” he says. “I ended up hearing back rather quickly. Lilly was the career opportunity I was looking for the entire time.”

Jackson Cahn received his PhD in chemistry-protein engineering from the California Institute of Technology in 2016. He finished a 3-year postdoc at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) Zurich before taking a job with Merck & Co. in Rahway New Jersey.

“I spent a year applying for academic jobs” Cahn says noting that the interview process was brutal. “I spent 2 months putting hundred-hour weeks into getting my job applications together while being a vaguely helpful member of the lab I was in. I got a few interviews.” Then the pandemic hit causing a drag on an already slow-moving job search.

The pandemic didn’t seem to be slowing down the industry job market however. “I applied for 52 faculty positions and got three interviews. I only sent out seven résumés to industry and I got four interviews and three job offers” he says.

Speed also characterizes work in an industrial lab Cahn learned. “It’s a much faster time from having an idea to having it up and running in a lab” he says. The timeline is accelerated by collaboration at a level new to him. “In academia even if you are working with a team you have your project answerable to your principal investigator. Here because I’m working with a team people are waiting for me to deliver my part of the project. It’s been a learning curve in a good way forcing me to learn new ways of thinking.”

The postdoc’s future

The flurry of hiring in the pharmaceutical sector has academia looking closely at the educational role of postdoctoral fellowships.

“There is absolutely still a place for the postdoc” but it needs some attention says Jen Heemstra a chemistry professor at Emory and a C&EN columnist. “There is a huge gap between what the purpose of a postdoc should be and what postdocs end up being. That gap is created by things we need to change in our academic system and by imperfections in the economy. Hopefully this is a moment for us to have more dialogue in the community about the purpose of the postdoc and how we should align our practices in academia to meet the needs of early-career researchers.”

Hall at NCATS is concerned about the effect of PhD recipients’ skipping the postdoc. “I have this hang-up about chemists never really getting the right training experiences” he says. “From a selfish point of view it can impact some of the research programs we do in that if we can’t recruit postdocs some programs might not ever move forward or take off.”

Hall says he is glad he raised a balloon on Twitter. “It gives you an idea of how really hot the market is right now for both medicinal chemists and computational chemists.” Which isn’t a bad thing he says.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlcHVibGljYW5oZXJhbGQuY29tL3p6LWRucC9wLXJlZWQtbWF1cmVyL2FydGljbGVfMTlkZTRhYjktNTM2Yi01NWUxLTk5MWEtYmNiMDBmNDEyYjZiLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,P.

In my first job with Emerson Electric in Hong Kong we hired a promising young MBA. However our new hire of Chinese origin started finding it difficult to blend into our multi-cultural environment. I was struggling to get across to him and his performance was less than acceptable. I despaired that we would have to let him go.

Who did you approach and why?

I spoke to Mark Ng who was our Director of Sales. Mark was a very thoughtful person who had built a great career and reputation at Emerson. He was of Chinese origin himself and I felt he would be able to provide me with a more nuanced view of the problem.

What was the advice you received?

Mark advised I should take a step back and look at the problem from the employee’s perspective. You can’t understand someone until you’ve walked a mile in their shoes. While he probably came across as aloof and not willing to adjust the reality was that he was defensive. This defensiveness primarily stemmed from the fact he was not comfortable with communicating in English.

How effective was it in resolving your problem?

Not only was the advice effective in turning around the situation it has stayed with me. Every time I feel that we are dealing with someone who is promising but not performing or someone who is diffident because she/he comes from a different background I step back and look at the situation from the person’s perspective.

Lights Normalcy Steadily Coming Back to Tangipahoa Parish Following Hurricane Ida

09/12/2021

The sun shines behind clouds overlooking the University Center and bucket trucks at Southeastern in Hammond Louisiana.

Customer in Robert who rode out storm says she is grateful to have power again

Jetta Myers considers herself fortunate fortunate to have survived one of the strongest storms to ever hit Louisiana and fortunate to have power again. But it was her experience with an Entergy Louisiana lineman that brought her hope and comfort in what otherwise are difficult times.

Myers and her 11-year-old daughter Amara rode out Hurricane Ida at their home in the Tangipahoa Parish community of Robert. When asked about the experience Myers described it in one word “Horrible.”

Once it was all said and done neighbors helped pull Myers’ mailbox from the middle of the street and she counted her blessings and reminded her daughter to do the same.

“I’ve been talking to God a lot lately” Myers said. “My daughter will tell you every night I say ‘Say your prayers for the people who lost everything and the people who came here to help us.’”

Among the people who have been helping get the lights back on is Keith McKnight an Entergy Louisiana lineworker out of Hammond.

On Wednesday after water in the area had receded McKnight was traveling along LA-445 when he saw a sign that read “Linemen We Need Power.” A “helper by nature” McKnight turned onto North Bennett Lane and observed that two laterals (or sets of power lines) served the neighborhood. One had damages in the way of a downed power line and was not a quick fix. The other simply needed to be “refused”.

After throwing in the switch the lights came back on for several customers in the area including Myers.

“He was very patient and kind” Myers said adding that she will be forever grateful to McKnight for taking the time to speak with her and do what he could in their time of need.

When asked why he does line work McKnight humbly says “To help people. I like to see the smiles on peoples faces when we restore their power and I like to know our customers are safe and taken care of.”

Myers and McKnight’s story is just one example of what is taking place across Tangipahoa Parish following Ida. On Saturday signs of normalcy as well as power restoration activities were in full swing.

Beyond the broken fences and piles of pine and oak logs along North Coburn Road in Hammond someone could be seen driving a golf cart along the green of a local country club. Just up the road along U.S. Highway 190 a local grocery store appeared to be having one of its best days with the parking lot nearly at capacity and the entrance serving as a revolving door.

On the other side of town members of Entergy’s storm team were reviewing plans to repair the electric system from Kentwood to Ponchatoula. Teams Line Supervisor Darrell Woullard said have been broken up by substation.

“We’re starting at the source of power and working our way outward” Woullard said. “Crews have been assigned to one of six substations and are responsible for repairing and energizing main lines that branch out from the substations and provide power to homes and businesses.”

He added “It’s taking time to complete repairs especially in our hard-to-access wooded areas but we’re making great progress.”

And progress it is… As of Saturday morning crews had restored electric service to approximately 75% of Tangipahoa and St. Helena Parish customers who lost service following Ida and could safely receive it.

Ida did a number on the company’s electric system in Tangipahoa Parish. Approximately 3300 distribution utility poles 8000 transformers and 840 spans of wire (from pole to pole) were left in need of repair or replacement.

According to McKnight restoring this amount of damage is no easy feat especially in a parish like Tangipahoa. A lineworker he said experiences all that Louisiana has to offer in terms of geography when working there.

McKnight described it like this: “There’s the downtown area that has underground facilities. Then there’s the more rural areas in the woods where miles of power lines may only serve a handful of customers. And then there are facilities along waterways in Manchac and near Lee’s Landing that can only be accessed by boat. All of that is here.”

But despite the challenges Entergy personnel say they are up to the task and are thankful for mutual aid.

“We couldn’t do this without the parish and our utility partners” Woullard said. “Although the lights are coming back to Tangipahoa Parish we’re not going to be satisfied until all customers who can safely accept power have it.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdW1hdG9kYXkuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvMjAyMS8wOS8xMS9jdXJmZXctY2hhbmdlZC10ZXJyZWJvbm5lLXN0b3JtLXJlY292ZXJ5LWNvbnRpbnVlcy84MzAxMDMwMDAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Thousands remain without power in Terrebonne and Lafourche two weeks after Ida,"Sunday marked two weeks since Hurricane Ida tore through Terrebonne and Lafourche.

About 22508 people or 81% still remained without power in Terrebonne and 31078 or 70% of customers in Lafourche Entergy officials said.

Terrebonne's daily curfew has been changed to 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. officials said. As more power is restored the curfew will be assessed Terrebonne Sheriff Tim Soignet said.

The daily curfew in Lafourche remains 7 p.m. to 6 a.m.

Entergy Louisiana spokesman Brandon Scardigli said Sunday crews are working to restore electricity to businesses in Terrebonne.

“We will continue to address major damages to lines in and around areas with an emphasis on trying to restore power to key commercial locations like grocery stores pharmacies and gas stations in the near future” he said.

The company is continuing to clear roads and pick up poles and wires while repairing feeder lines at the same time Scardigli said.

“We expect to continue this focus while we expand to residential areas and restore power to the parish” he said.

Terrebonne Parish President Gordy Dove thanked crews for their hard work during the last 14 days.

“It's been two weeks today that Hurricane Ida passed through Terrebonne creating devastating damage throughout our parish” Dove said Sunday. “Power is being restored to thousands of homes daily and water has been restored to about 90% of Terrebonne. We have made significant strides over the last two weeks but we still have a long ways to go.”

Residents south of the Intracoastal Waterway in Terrebonne are still advised to boil their water before drinking it the parish's water district said. The same applies to about 97 customers in the Oakshire subdivision north of the waterway.

Though most Entergy customers in Lafourche are projected to have power by Sept. 29 some may not have electricity beyond that date due to the extent of the damage Scardigli said.

“The area suffered massive damage and the electric network in southern portions of the parish will have to be completely rebuilt” he said. “These areas including Golden Meadow and areas south of Golden Meadow may experience outages that extend beyond Sept. 29. We are currently evaluating alternate solutions to be able to safely provide power as quickly as possible.”

A boil-water advisory remained in place in all of south Lafourche and parts of central Lafourche. Other areas of Lafourche under the order as of Monday included Gheens Des Allemands the Romero subdivision in Bayou Blue and Grand Bois.

A burn ban remains in place for Terrebonne and Lafourche.

Though the Superdome the team’s stadium in New Orleans did not suffer major damage when Hurricane Ida swept through the region nearly a million customers in Louisiana were still without power days after the storm tore through the state causing flooding and knocking out power lines. Entergy Louisiana’s largest utility said on Wednesday that it could be days before electricity was fully restored in New Orleans and other Louisiana cities hit by Ida.

The City Council voted 5-0 at its Aug. 31 meeting to approve the purchase from the private school.

The roughly 4-acre site is at 384 N. Erbes Road at the corner of Hillcrest Drive near downtown Thousand Oaks Boulevard.

""It would provide a great opportunity for the city to collaborate with a potential affordable housing developer of the site to provide much-needed affordable units in the city"" Haider Alawami the city's economic development manager told the council.

The council voted 4-1 to require that the units such as townhomes or condominiums be for sale not for rent so that low-income residents can build equity.

Councilman Kevin McNamee dissented on grounds that he favors rentals with a stipulation that renters can only live there for a limited time.

That will encourage the low-income ""occupants to economically move up and purchase a market-rate home"" he said Friday. ""My concern with low-income housing ownership is that this model offers no incentive to move out of low-income housing.""

Hillcrest Christian School had operated at the site since the mid-1970s.

About two years ago the school relocated to a new Thousand Oaks site on Wilbur Road.

""Since then city staff has fielded many inquiries regarding the potential redevelopment of the site ranging from assisted living/memory care facilities apartments and for-sale townhomes projects"" Deputy City Manager Gary Rogers wrote in a report.

See what others are reading in related news:

Several public speakers at the Aug. 31 meeting voiced support for the city buying the site for affordable housing.

""On behalf of the Conejo Climate Coalition I would just like to say that we're thrilled by the prospect of the city purchasing the Hillcrest Christian School site and collaborating with an affordable housing developer to build some much-needed affordable units"" said Thousand Oaks resident Kat Selm.

Jackson Piper of unincorporated Newbury Park said he would like the council ""to see this as an opportunity to place a large number of (affordable) units ... within easy walking distance of the shops and services of Thousand Oaks Boulevard and also with access to the Thousand Oaks transit system.""

The units would be for ""people who would not normally be able to afford to live in Thousand Oaks or who are struggling to live in Thousand Oaks"" he said.

Council members said the city clearly needs more low-income housing.

""When it comes to developers offering affordable housing for sale that's a whole different ballgame"" Councilman Al Adam said. ""That's because the cost of land is so expensive.

""This is a unique opportunity to get some for-sale (affordable) properties to build equity for people through homeownership"" he said.

Mayor Claudia Bill-de la Peña said she was ""personally very excited ... to provide housing for our hard-working families in our community"" through the purchase of the site.

Alawami said the sale is in escrow.

""And hopefully within 30 days we'll take over the property"" he said.

Once the purchase is finalized the city will request developers to propose projects for the site. The proposals will be evaluated by city planners and the top two or three will be presented to the City Council with a recommendation to select one Alawami said.

Once the council picks one the proposal will undergo the city's lengthy evaluation process including a hearing before the Planning Commission and ultimately back before the council for a final decision on whether to approve the project.

“A single mother Olga Martinez who has been living in The Inn Between of Longmont Supportive Housing program applied to become a Habitat for Humanity homeowner with help of our bilingual housing advocate Leslie Ogeda” Inn Between of Longmont Development and Associate Director Laura Liotino said.

Martinez who began putting her 250 hours of “sweat equity” into her Dacono home this week said “when I found that my family was selected for a Habitat home I was full of joy to see the effort and dedication when one works toward your dreams.”

“My reaction first was in gratitude to God for the immense love for my family and those around me” Martinez said. “This is a great achievement — being able to offer a better future for my daughter gives me peace of mind.”

Liotino said the Latina single mother of one has participated in The Inn Between’s Transitional Housing program since May 2018 and “during that time she has been working and paying an affordable rent; even when her employment was affected by the pandemic she managed to keep on top of her finances to prove to the Habitat Program team that she has the wherewithal to merit homeownership.”

Martinez said she is looking forward to participating in the program hoping this partnership will help her prove to herself there are no obstacles she can’t overcome.

“The most exciting thing is to be able to have a safe place to live and an investment in the future” she said.

Both The Inn Between and St. Vrain Habitat homeownership programs work to empower their participants and offers steppingstones to stability through supportive services for its participants.

“Habitat is a next step on the continuum for our participants — designed to give hard-working families the opportunity for homeownership that would not otherwise be a possibility” Liotino said.

Families participating in the program are selected based on need the ability to repay an affordable mortgage willingness to work with family services invest 250 to 500 hours of sweat equity to build their home complete formal financial budgeting and counseling and save a required down payment.

“Once a participant is awarded the keys to their home they pay an affordable mortgage which is reinvested to build more homes” Habitat for Humanity volunteer coordinator Nikki Watt said. “Volunteerism is a crucial aspect that empowers everyone involved by breaking down social barriers — for participants that’s through sweat equity.”

Inn Between staffers say it’s bittersweet to see Martinez leave the program but are happy they were able to help transition her daughter and her into a home they will own.

“It is very exciting when we can see the results of our supportive housing program resulting in permanent homeownership. Our community truly thrives when people achieve this” Liotino said. “We look forward to seeing the generational effects having a permanent home will have for Olga’s daughter.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXRpbWVzLmNvLnVrL2FydGljbGUvdGV0cmFyY2gtbGFuZHMtMS01MDAtbmV3LWhvbWVzLWRlYWwtcGNjcWxzeHAy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tetrarch lands 1500 new homes deal,"Tetrarch the Irish property group which owns the Mount Juliet and Citywest hotels has got private equity backing for its plans to build 1500 homes over the next five years.

Kilner’s ties with Brandon Truaxe her partner at Deciem since its inception ran deep. They had become friends during her time at Alliance Boots—her first job out of Nottingham Trent University—when they had run off in 2013 to do something seemingly absurd: try to launch 10 beauty brands all at once. Truaxe and Kilner spent five years building a lab-based affordable beauty product idea into what is now a near half-billion–dollar empire with stores across the globe including in the U.K. Canada Australia South Korea and the U.S.

In the year leading up to Truaxe’s tragic passing the numbers point to a success story. Deciem had landed a major investment from the Estée Lauder Companies and it was opening its first store in the U.S. One of its brands the Ordinary was flying off the shelves at Sephora and the company was struggling to fill orders. Truaxe and Kilner’s startup had quite suddenly turned into a booming business.



Yet internally everything was spiraling.



There were the erratic Instagram posts from the corporate account the sudden termination of key partnerships and the instantaneous firings and C-suite resignations. There were press reports of drug abuse and hospitalizations. Truaxe tried to fire Kilner on several occasions in 2018 Kilner tells Fortune; he only officially had the authority to do so once and he asked her to return a few weeks afterward. Truaxe reportedly denied he struggled with mental illness.



“He quickly pushed away anyone who was close to him” Kilner says. “He ultimately didn’t want anyone who loved him or cared for him challenging his behavior or wanting to get him help.”



It all escalated in October 2018 when Truaxe unbeknownst to the rest of the executive team posted from the company Instagram page that Deciem was shutting down. Investor Estée Lauder stepped in and filed a lawsuit in Ontario which ultimately removed Truaxe as the company’s chief executive and formally severed his ties with the company. Mere months later Truaxe fell from an apartment in Toronto. His passing absolutely shook the company but it took a uniquely devastating toll on the woman who had been quietly assembling Deciem by Truaxe’s side but always in his shadow: Nicola Kilner.



As part of Estée Lauder’s lawsuit in fall 2018 Kilner the longtime champion behind Deciem’s sales growth and retail partnerships would now be responsible for saving it.

Late nights in the lab

Kilner originally from Sheffield in northern England was captivated by Truaxe’s passion and vision when they first met during her time at Alliance Boots. She was only a few years out of university having worked her way up from junior project manager while she was still in school to buying manager; he was at Indeed Labs another Canadian beauty company he had founded. Kilner had her own entrepreneurial idea at the time: a review website called Beauty Wise (“almost like a Tripadvisor for beauty” Kilner says). She recalls long conversations between the two of them about the industry life and the world.

When Truaxe approached her about his plans for Deciem it was a no-brainer: She would help him build Deciem and he would help her build Beauty Wise. Almost immediately their focus solely turned to Deciem. “It just became clear that it was growing into something really special” she says.

Deciem began as most startups do: with an idea and few resources. The company’s name stems from “decima” which is Latin for the 10th. Truaxe wanted to launch 10 brands at once—they could share a lab production facilities a design team back-end systems and scale together. Initially Deciem wouldn’t be allowed to touch facial skin care as Truaxe had a noncompete from his former company so they explored hair care and supplements and tried to garner attention.

Kilner speaks fondly of those initial years though Deciem has always required an enormous sacrifice of her time: her honeymoon; others’ birthdays and weddings. She recalls many late nights working behind the machines and making the products. Some of the brands they launched no longer exist.

But it was the Ordinary the suite of 27 products—now more than 58 (including its sets)—launched in August 2016 that really put Deciem on the map. The skin care line was radically different from comparable products on the market: simple bare-bones skin care formulas at a fraction of the price. A vitamin and mineral blemish product comes in a cloudy glass bottle. It’s named after its ingredients (“Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%”) and a 60-milliliter container costs less than $6.

“Luxury should be about authenticity not just because it has a high price point” Kilner says.

In early 2017 Deciem released a foundation for the Ordinary which triggered a 75000-person wait list prelaunch and Sephora added the item to its stores that year. Kim Kardashian and a host of Reddit fans began swearing by the product line. The company posted $300 million in sales that year.

When the Ordinary took off Deciem was doing its own manufacturing and it didn’t have the infrastructure in place to support the newfound demand. “We were out of stock everywhere” Kilner recalls mentioning that the company had to keep revising its forecasts. In the 18 months after launching the Ordinary Deciem had quadrupled in size going from about 200 to 800 employees Kilner says.

Throughout the company’s evolution and scale Truaxe had been center stage: first as the visionary; later as more or less a villain. Kilner though she was an instrumental cofounder of the company was rarely under the spotlight.

“Nicola was as integral to building this as Brandon was in a different function” says Stephen Kaplan the chief operating officer of Deciem. Truaxe was behind the innovation and the product development and Kilner drove the sales partnerships and growth. From inception Kilner has been a steady hand quietly developing the company as it grew. By the beginning of 2019 she was the glue holding it all together.

The most powerful force

Most leaders can summon their run-ins with adversity in an instant: the moments that changed them the decisions that defined them.

After Kilner learned of Truaxe’s passing in January 2019 “just everything came crashing down” she says. She had become CEO of Deciem in October and a mother in December. She was trying to scale Deciem to support its ever-growing orders shortly after it had been nearly dismembered publicly.

It wasn’t Kilner’s first stint as CEO. She had held the position briefly at the time of its founding and a few years later served as its co-CEO. But now she was at the company’s helm without Truaxe. And she was grieving. “Brandon was truly one of my best friends in life” she says.

The respect was mutual—as is evident from a letter Truaxe published in a brochure for the annual Cosmetic Executive Women Achiever Awards where Kilner was recognized in late 2017:

“Life teaches many valuable lessons and these lessons over time form what we broadly call maturity. One important such lesson is skepticism—which is really an honest recognition of the limits of how good something someone or life itself can be.

“Your boundless passion intelligence commitment perseverance humility and love have taught me and us that good doesn’t really have a limit. The day you came into our lives was the day we learned to do the undoable—to unlearn skepticism because limitless good is the most powerful force in life.

“Thank you for bringing so much goodness so much energy so much care and so much love to everything you touch. Deciem would not exist without you. You deserve this recognition more so than words can ever be written or said about it.

“I love you. We love you. You are ours. And we are lucky proud and—more than anything—thankful that you are you.”

The glue

As the sole CEO of Deciem Kilner did what she had always done with Deciem: She built. Soon after Estée Lauder had ousted Truaxe Kilner brought back Kaplan and Dionne Lois Cullen the chief brand officer who had both parted ways with Deciem during what Kaplan refers to as “the dark times.” The three of them along with Prudvi Kaka Deciem’s chief scientific officer have carried the beauty company into its next iteration.

Deciem has more than doubled its revenue growth each year since 2017—posting a record $460 million in revenue in the 12 months ended in January 2021. It now has more than 1300 employees. Estée Lauder purchased a majority stake in the company earlier this year after pouring another $1 billion into the company. It currently holds a 76% stake in the company and plans to purchase the rest after three years. Deciem’s executive team will stay intact.

But apart from getting bigger the company has also gone through a series of changes though it still has the outspoken and bold marketing it’s known for. Kilner underlines the importance to her of loyalty and of kindness: Deciem employees stuck with the company when it was falling apart in 2018 and it “works both ways” she says.

When the pandemic struck in 2020 Kilner committed to not lay off any of its workers. The company purchased new software for retailers to do virtual at-home consultations and had all of its office employees working from home. Production employees who could not work remotely received pay premiums to cover any additional expenses like private transportation. Employees could choose not to work in the facilities and stay on staff at a 20% pay reduction. The company set up an independently-run fund during the pandemic where employees could privately seek financial aid. The company gave $200000 and Kilner herself and other executives put in their bonuses.

Unsurprisingly Kilner is acutely focused on the mental health of her employees. Shortly after Truaxe passed away Deciem brought in therapists for group and one-on-one sessions. Since then the company has continued to bring in counselors for traumatic or global incidents such as the worldwide racial reckoning spawned by the murder of George Floyd in 2020. Deciem also offers access to 24/7 independent counseling and mental health days for all of its employees.

But Kilner hopes to focus as well on Deciem’s impact outside its own walls drawing more attention to the beauty supply chain and spotlighting animal abuse in the industry. Kilner has plans to establish Deciem as a B Corporation in 2022 which is a private certification requiring companies to meet social environmental and transparency standards. “We want to power more growth so we can do more good and that’s ultimately what we’re trying to achieve in the next couple of years” Kilner says.

Truaxe’s fingerprints can still be seen across the company and that’s by design. While the traces of any erratic Instagram posts have been removed his words his personality and his ideas are still featured prominently on the website and the social media pages—his legacy is discussed and it is felt.

Kilner refers to herself as “very underqualified” to be Deciem’s CEO; she talks more about the strength and skill of the company’s executive team and its employees than she does about herself. Most of all she speaks of the influence of Brandon Truaxe.

“When I first met Brandon—he’s someone who just captures your heart and your spirit someone who’s just so energized and truly believes in changing the world and the ability to make things better.”

One could use exactly the same words to describe Kilner.

Designers like Jerry Lorenzo of Fear of God have been pioneering Christian messaging through high-end streetwear brands for years but now that same ethos has started to enter the closets of those for whom $700 (£500) sweatpants are unrealistic. On Instagram the hashtag #christianstreetwear has generated over 22000 posts  with people wearing T-shirts featuring Bible verses or #Blessed logos. These days they’re not looking too different from mainstream streetwear brands who evoke spirituality as a tool to foster community and spread positivity. Just recently Balenciaga created cross-bearing T-shirts for Kanye West’s Donda merch proving the kind of cross-pollination that’s using codes from the secular world — much like West’s album — to the masses at the Mercedes Benz Stadium. Howard shares West’s vision. While Christians may be the target customers for these clothes Howard says that he doesn’t just focus on this community because “it’d be like preaching to the choir.” “It’s a tool to spread the gospel” he says.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdpbmRpYW5leHByZXNzLmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50LzIwMjEvU2VwLzEyL3dvbmRlcmluZy13aGF0LXRvLWJpbmdlLW5leHQtYWRkLXRoZXNlLTE1LW9mZmJlYXQtbmV0ZmxpeC1zZXJpZXMtdG8teW91ci13YXRjaGxpc3QtMjM1NjY0My5odG1s0gGkAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld2luZGlhbmV4cHJlc3MuY29tL2FtcC9zdG9yeS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50LzIwMjEvU2VwLzEyL3dvbmRlcmluZy13aGF0LXRvLWJpbmdlLW5leHQtYWRkLXRoZXNlLTE1LW9mZmJlYXQtbmV0ZmxpeC1zZXJpZXMtdG8teW91ci13YXRjaGxpc3QtMjM1NjY0My5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wondering what to binge next?

The novelty consists in the concealed door fitting technology by WOGG which ensures that the running blades cannot be seen even when the cabinet is open.

WOGG has unveiled a collection of roll-top furniture with an innovative mechanism that allows the interior to be seen without taking up any extra space. Each piece features tambour doors and the “WOGG 75 tambour door system” a guiding element concealed within a lightweight framework.

The system was developed over a period of 13 months in collaboration with various engineers and material specialists. A closer look at the design reveals a small injection-moulded plastic component which houses a soft rubber tyre that can be snapped into either the top or bottom of the slats. This allows the door to glide along the upper or lower track.

The system is made up of a sliding mechanism – in this case a cube-shaped guiding element – and aluminium profiles. A lightweight construction uses a material thickness of just one millimetre and its shape accommodates custom dimensions enabling both convex and concave lines.

The collection is a celebration of the ellipse a basic shape that informs the shape of each of the five pieces but the novelty of the system lies in the hidden sliding mechanism which has been internationally patented.

“In our eyes the beauty lies in the intelligence of the solution” says WOGG creative director Christophe Marchand. “The new tambour door slides silently along the track without resistance thanks to optimum weight distribution. Each of these pieces can stand alone in a room as an elegant monolith.”

The collection comprises cupboards bars and sideboards including the W79 wardrobe which performs the same function as a typical foyer closet but is light and elegant in appearance with a striking red interior. The W81 Bigboard High has the same amount of storage but in the shape of a two-tier sideboard.

Also featuring generous proportions is the W82 Sideboard which reinterprets the emblematic sideboard for spacious living areas. Meanwhile the more compact dimensions of the W83 Bar makes it sustainable for smaller spaces. Inside the height of the shelves corresponds to the height of bottles.

Finally the W84 smallboard is a small piece of storage furniture that WOGG says has many possible uses – as a bedside table chest of drawers or bathroom cabinet as a place for storing scarves and gloves in the corridor or as a tall side table. It has an open base with an interior divided by a shelf.

How very novel. These days although a garage might be on the wish list for many a house-hunter it appears that some of us who do own one are not using it for its original purpose.

Research by Admiral Loans prior to the pandemic showed that only 33 per cent of garage owners actually use theirs to house a car – this may be because there’s no room as the garage is already stuffed with tools old furniture and other household clutter. Add to that the fact that modern cars have grown wider by a third over the past 55 years according to the RAC Foundation – which makes it harder to actually fit them in – and it seems clear that the typical garage isn’t much more than a dusty waste of space.

That could be changing however. Thanks to the national home-improvement drive of the past 18 months planning applications for home renovations are up by 20 per cent in London alone according to researchers Barbour ABI with garage conversions being among the most popular projects.

‘Converting a garage into living space offers a quick and simple way to add square footage to your home without extending’ says David Westgate of property consultants Andrews (andrewsonline.co.uk). ‘It could add 10 to 15 per cent to the value of your property. Plus as you aren’t starting from scratch you may not have to spend time and money on laying foundations and constructing walls and a roof.’ If the garage is attached to the house you may not even need planning permission to convert it.

‘It’s not completely straightforward though’ adds Westgate. ‘If you’re planning to turn it into a living space you’ll need to consider light heating and insulation. Garages are generally dark and cold so you’ll need to lay pipes and fit radiators.’

The conversion of a garage that already opens off the house can cost as little as £9000 which includes insulation blocking up the door and a basic fit-out according to Checkatrade. But as architect Michael Schienke points out it’s not always a simple job. ‘With many garages you need to strengthen the roof and redo elements of it which you think are already there but need to be improved. It’s cheaper than having to build the space from scratch but sometimes not all that much cheaper.’

Invest some time money and creative thinking however and a previously underused space could add a whole new dimension to your home as the following examples attest.

What to know before you start

If your garage is integral to the house and you aren’t planning to enlarge the exterior structure it will probably fall under permitted development so you won’t need planning permission – unless you live in a conservation area or a listed building in which case you probably will. Either way the work will need to comply with building regulations for the finished room to be considered habitable.

If the garage is a separate structure you may need to apply for planning permission for a change of use – check planningportal.co.uk for advice.

Galway to check out a 63-cubicle house built last year on the farm of David Gillane – built for the main purpose of creating extra slurry storage.

David runs both a spring and autumn-calving system which sees him calve down 60 cows in spring and the same again during the autumn.

At the time of Agriland’s visit David had calved down over 20 cows. His system which suits him perfectly he says as he does the majority of the work himself and wouldn’t be able to calve down all of his cows say in the springtime as he would be overwhelmed.

David has invested quite a bit of money in the farm over the last number of years including putting in a new 10-unit milking parlour calving shed and silage slab.

The last piece of the puzzle David said was increasing his slurry storage – which he says was tight on the farm.

Speaking to Agriland during the week David said: “I have spent quite a bit of money modernising the farm over the last number of years and I suppose the one area I needed to improve to add the finishing touch was increasing my slurry storage.

“I had thought about putting up a tower to store the slurry but I was thinking it would be an awful eyesore and really only serve one purpose.

“So I said to myself that putting up a cubicle shed would make a lot more sense and it would obviously serve more than one purpose – which for any sizeable investment is what you want.” David Gillane

The cubicle house was built on what was once a paddock for cows to graze in.

David made contact with Henry Lydon who designed the shed while Michael Kelly of Michael Kelly Engineering erected the shed and hung all the gates and barriers. All the concrete work was carried out by Sean Grealish.

The cubicle house is 28.8m long and 14.8m wide. The unit stands 6.6m high at the apex and 4.0m to the eve gutters.

The concrete walls of the shed stand 2.4m high. The two slatted tanks are both 28.5m long. Both tanks are 4.7m wide; however due to the cubicles at the back of the shed the slatted floor area is smaller (2.67m wide) compared to the tank at the front of the unit which stretches 5.1m wide.

There are four agitation points – one at either end of each tank.

The 63 cubicles in the shed measure 2.4m long and 1.35m wide. While at either end of the back-to-back cubicles in the centre of the unit is a walkway – which measures 2.3m – and allows cows to move the whole way around the shed.

David has the option also of feeding his cows from two sides of the shed one side at the front which measures 28.5m long and at one side of the shed which measures 9.5m long. Source: Henry Lydon

Creating extra slurry storage ‘was the priority’

As mentioned already David’s main aim was to create more slurry storage on the farm as cow numbers had crept up since taking over the running of the farm from his father.

This meant the last few years slurry storage has been “tight” according to David and having decided against putting up a tower for slurry storage he opted for a cubicle shed.

Originally the plan was to put in an L-shaped tank but after talking with Henry Lydon they both decided on putting in two rectangular tanks 16ft wide and 120ft long.

Speaking about the need for more slurry storage David said: “I couldn’t see the benefit of putting up an overground slurry tank.

“So I said putting up a cubicle shed would make more sense and be ideal for housing my dry cows and in-calf heifers.

“The original plan was to put in an L-shaped tank but after talking to Henry we decided that I would put down two tanks – just so that I would have more than enough space and that if I had to keep cows in longer than expected I wouldn’t be stuck or tight like before.

“So over in the main housing facilities I can pump the slurry over to this new cubicle shed which I did last winter and I didn’t even fill both tanks – so finally I don’t have to be looking over my shoulder and having to worry about tanks filling up and being stuck.

Inside the 63-cubicle house

Looking inside the unit David was keen on having a cubicle house that had plenty of feed space and also had an emphasis on cow comfort.

Looking at the latter first David contacted Easyfix and sourced 63 cubicles from them along with mattresses for each one.

David fitted them himself and said that it was easily done and the fact that they are light in weight meant it was easier and faster to get them fitted.

He added: “I’m big on cow comfort and I’ve seen the Easyfix cubicles on farms and have heard good things about them from farmers.

“The cows are very happy on them. The one thing I like is the flexibility of them. The flexibility in the cubicles means the cows are not going to get hurt stepping up into the cubicle bed or get caught in them.

“I have standard steel ones in sheds across the yard and I would have cows getting stuck in them but that’s not an issue with the Easyfix ones.

“I find the cubicles great for training the heifers into. They take to them very well.

“I put sawdust on them once a week as well which I find works well and then lime the cubicles every day.

“The cows just seem very comfortable on them and the fact I could fit them myself as well was great.”

At either end of the shed lies two tip-over water drinkers. Again David said they are a good job and can be cleaned out instantly – thus making sure cows have access to clean fresh water at all times.



As it is a grant-spec shed the features you would expect of such a shed can be seen throughout. David went with vented sheeting at the back of the shed and also opted to go with spaced sheeting on the roof.

Similar to the slurry storage there is no lack of feed space either – as mentioned David can feed cows from two sides of the shed.

If David wanted to he could lock cows in at the back of the shed – which gives the flexibility of keeping the dry cows separate from the in-calf heifers for example.

Cost

David availed of the Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Scheme (TAMS II) but having made part use of it before for another investment on the farm he was only able to claim up to 20%.

The overall cost of the cubicle house came to €110000. However when the grant is deducted from the overall cost the build is standing to David at just over €90000.

Speaking about whether going with a cubicle shed was the right decision David said that “it was 100%”.

He added: “Looking back with my first winter over and going into my second one now it was the right decision.

“Last winter by the time cows were out the tanks weren’t even full. So not only is my slurry storage issue a thing in the past but I also have a cubicle house with more than enough housing and plenty of feed space.

“The cows are very happy in it and I’m pleased in the end it was the correct decision” David concluded by saying.",,,

We have known for a long time that senior figures in the Bush administration were pressing for war against Iraq as soon as the 9/11 attacks happened. Although they eventually decided to march on Baghdad via Kabul Dick Cheney Donald Rumsfeld and others worked tirelessly to convince the US public that Saddam Hussein was responsible for 9/11 — with stunning if temporary success. George Bush and Tony Blair did not lean so heavily on the purported link between Iraq and Al Qaeda when addressing world opinion. In their presentations to the UN they claimed that war was necessary because of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction. The WMD narrative crumbled as dramatically as the story about Saddam Hussein’s alliance with Osama bin Laden. Which brings us back to the oil. The architects of the war and their supporters in the Anglo-American media scornfully dismissed the idea that they were motivated by such concerns. For the antiwar marchers on the other hand it was plain common sense. The more simplistic (or caricatural) versions of the “war for oil” thesis may not stand up to scrutiny. But there is no question that the marchers were much closer to the truth than the official rationalizers of the war.

From Churchill to Blair I sometimes wonder whether Tony Blair had an eye on Winston Churchill when he said of the Iraq War in 2003: “The oil conspiracy theory is honestly one of the most absurd.” Back in 1920 Churchill had told the British parliament that the idea of an oil motive behind Britain’s Mesopotamia Campaign during the First World War was “too absurd for acceptance.” Six years earlier as first lord of the Admiralty Churchill had championed the half-nationalization of Anglo-Persian Oil Company (later renamed BP) which had recently found oil in Persia (now Iran) and was looking to expand into neighboring Mesopotamia (Iraq). His goal was to secure fuel for the Royal Navy’s battleship fleet. Just eleven days after the British state acquired 51 percent of Anglo-Persian archduke Franz Ferdinand was assassinated in Sarajevo. It’s a little more complicated these days. Oil no longer flows through closed supply chains from a BP well to a BP forecourt or from a British colony to the British military. Since the 1980s oil has been mostly traded on open markets between any buyer and any seller. Western strategists are not so much trying to get oil into their own hands (or the hands of their companies) but rather to maintain plentiful and cheap global supplies — as expensive oil can cripple their economies. Nor is access to oil any more such a decisive factor in warfare as any other army can buy it too. The result is that Western strategists are not so much trying to get oil into their own hands (or the hands of their companies) but rather to maintain plentiful and cheap global supplies — as expensive oil can cripple their economies. To that end they aim to maximize foreign investment in oilfields so as to boost the flow. At the time of the Iraq War three-quarters of the world’s oil was off-limits to the fossil-fuel companies as governments preferred to run their oil industries in-house and their economies were not generally best served by pumping as fast as possible.

Strategic Interests To me fighting a war to break open a country’s oil industry to foreign investment sounds no more justified than fighting one to seize the oil as loot. I still get asked “So was it a war for oil?” I find it a surprising question as it’s no secret that Iraq has nearly a tenth of the world’s remaining oil nor is it that the Persian Gulf region as a whole contains nearly half of the total (at the time of the war it was more like two-thirds). It’s only because our politicians denied any role for oil so insistently that it became a question at all. And perhaps those very denials stimulated suspicions of a bigger conspiracy than it was. No it was not some Cheneyesque master plan that played out over the years. In fact the approach to oil favored by US government officials changed several times from outright privatization to contracting by a US authority to contacting by an Iraqi authority. Different people in the US and British governments disagreed on the details such as whether to treat their own companies more favorably or whether to concentrate on breaking OPEC. But the strategic interests were certainly there. They were acknowledged in public documents — most famously Dick Cheney’s 2001 energy task force report: By any estimation Middle East oil producers will remain central to world oil security. The Gulf will be a primary focus of US international energy policy. Private government documents spelled the interests out even more explicitly. In the course of writing my book Fuel on the Fire I obtained the UK’s strategy for Iraqi oil dated May 2003 which baldly stated: The future shape of the Iraqi industry will affect oil markets and the functioning of OPEC in both of which we have a vital interest. Another strategy document from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office published in 2004 contained the following passage: Our wider energy policy objectives for Iraq need to be dovetailed with commercial goals to ensure the best result for the UK national interest. The two sets of goals are mutually enforcing given the need for foreign investment. Iraq’s energy sector will provide considerable market opportunities for UK firms. In the ninth volume of his 2016 report British civil servant Sir John Chilcot refers to numerous government documents that explicitly state the oil objective and outline how the United Kingdom pursued it throughout the occupation. Nonetheless Chilcot still took at face value the Blair government’s claim that its main motive was to address Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction.

Oil Planning The UK and US governments certainly formulated plans to secure those interests. In the months leading up to the war the State Department’s Future of Iraq Project and the Pentagon’s Energy Infrastructure Planning Group both worked out the details of a future Iraqi oil industry with foreign multinationals in charge. In late 2002 and early 2003 BP and Shell held at least five meetings with the British government on the subject of Iraq. The minutes of one such meeting in the Foreign Office in October 2002 began as follows: “Iraq is the big oil prospect. BP are desperate to get in there.” The approach to oil favored by US government officials changed several times from outright privatization to contracting by a US authority to contacting by an Iraqi authority. In another meeting Blair’s trade minister Baroness Symons said she believed that if Britain fought in the war British oil companies deserved to get a share of the spoils and she promised to lobby the US government to that effect. At the time the companies and government denied that any such meetings happened — it took me a five-year struggle under the Freedom of Information Act to get hold of the minutes. Then once the war had taken place the United States and UK worked hard throughout the occupation to turn Iraq over to Big Oil. This began with the task of ensuring the right Iraqis were running the Oil Ministry and writing the blueprint for the industry’s future. The British even hired a former BP executive to draft Iraq’s contracts to be signed with companies like BP — although that initiative failed in the end. In 2007 President Bush announced a surge of thirty thousand troop reinforcements to be sent to Iraq. The surge is generally remembered — albeit wrongly — as what turned things around in Iraq ending the sectarian bloodshed and marking the first example of sensible US policymaking. At the time even critics accepted at face value the claimed noble aims and simply argued that it would not work in achieving them. They neglected the surge’s real political purposes: firstly to shore up the US allies in the Iraqi government many of whom were implicated in sectarian violence and secondly to pressure them to deliver political “benchmarks” — most importantly to pass a law restructuring the Iraqi oil industry in favor of foreign oil companies. Throughout 2007 during surprise visits to Baghdad by members of Bush’s national security team it was the oil law that dominated discussions. In the course of biweekly video conferences with Iraqi prime minister Nouri al-Maliki Bush repeatedly warned that US patience had grown thin and pressed Maliki on the oil law. The US made threats to cut off aid and reconstruction funds if the Iraqi government did not pass the law and even to remove Maliki from office.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmxvb3BwbmcuY29tL3BuZy1uZXdzL3BhcGEtcmVjZWl2ZXMtZXh4b25tb2JpbC1zdXBwb3J0LTEwNDM1NtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Papa receives ExxonMobil support,"EMPNG Executive Director Scott Sandlin said the construction of this important building was made possible because of the collaboration of ExxonMobil and the Gas Resources Company Veadi Koita Association Ward Councilors and their workers and Laba Holdings.

In little more than six years Exxon has made 22 high-quality oil discoveries in the 6.6-million-acre Stabroek Block the latest being at the 5938 feet Pinktail well located nearly 22 miles to the southeast of the Liza phase 1 development. Hess Exxon’s partner with a 30% interest in the Stabroek Block announced the successful appraisal of the Turbot oil discovery in the block at the 5790 feet Turbot 2 well 37 miles to the southeast of Liza phase 1.

Stabroek Block Oil Discoveries

Source: Hess.

Those latest discoveries along with earlier ones made during 2021 will boost the already discovered estimated recoverable resources of 9 billion barrels in the Stabroek Block.

This positive news highlights why Exxon after an extremely difficult 2020 at the end of last year announced it was prioritizing investment in offshore Guyana. The Stabroek Block has proven to be a bonanza for Exxon which is the operator and owns 45% as well as partners Hess and CNOOC which hold 30% and 25% respectively. By the end of 2020 Exxon’s Liza phase 1 development had reached full capacity pumping 120000 barrels per day. Even April 2021 operational issues concerning a gas compressor at the Liza Destiny FPSO which caused crude oil output to plunge by 75% to 30000 barrels per day have done little to impact long-term production. By May production had returned to capacity after reaching around 110000 barrels per day before the end of April 2021.

Exxon is focused on bringing the Liza phase 2 development online. The Liza Unity FPSO which will be utilized for Liza Phase 2 set sail from Singapore to Guyana earlier this month and is expected to commence operations in early 2022 adding another 220000 barrels per day of production capacity. Exxon is also working on the Payara project which is expected to commence operations during 2024 adding a further 220000 barrels per day to production to the Stabroek Block. By 2026 the energy supermajor anticipates pumping 750000 barrels of crude oil daily from the block although that number could be higher perhaps closer to 1 million barrels because of the four petroleum discoveries made since the start of 2021.

The Stabroek Block is a very attractive and profitable operation for Exxon and its partners. Liza phase 1 is breaking even $35 per barrel Brent placing it at the lower end of the global scale with the lowest being in the Middle East where oilfields on average breakeven at around $27 per barrel. Such a low breakeven price makes the Stabroek Block competitive with other South American oil producing jurisdictions. Suriname and Brazil have breakeven prices estimated to be at around $40 with some analysts predicting they could be lower than $35 per barrel. Exxon’s partner in the Stabroek Block Hess believes that when Liza Phase 2 commences operations during 2022 it will breakeven at $25 Brent one of if not the lowest breakeven price for any oil asset in Latin America. The breakeven price will fall further as has occurred in nearby Brazil as additional crude oil discoveries are developed and the required operational infrastructure is established.

The quality of the crude oil being pumped from the Stabroek Block is another reason for the rapidly rising popularity of offshore Guyana. Liza crude oil is light and sweet with an API gravity of 32 degrees and 0.58% sulfur content. While Liza has a pour point of 32 degrees Fahrenheit indicating it is high in paraffin the crude oil variety is relatively low in sulfur metals and other contaminants particularly compared to Venezuelan Colombian and Ecuadorean grades. As a result Liza crude oil is less carbon intensive easier and cheaper to refine making it a more attractive petroleum resource to exploit in a global economy which is focused on sharply reducing carbon emissions.

Those significant positive characteristics are enhanced by the petroleum sharing agreement which Exxon was able to secure on very favorable terms with Guyana’s national government in Georgetown. While there

has been considerable speculation about it being an unfair deal for Guyana which is open to being renegotiated the government of Irfaan Ali has previously stated it will remain intact. Exxon and its partners in the Stabroek Block are the only energy companies operating in offshore Guyana to have enjoyed such astonishing drilling success. The block’s considerable estimated recoverable petroleum resources of around 9 billion barrels combined with a notable number of recent oil discoveries point to its considerable petroleum potential. As the latest announcement concerning the Pinktail discovery demonstrates even the recent slew of dry holes have had little impact on Exxon’s performance. For these reasons offshore Guyana will soon become a leading driver of production and profit growth for Exxon.

In Washington's season opener against the visiting Los Angeles Chargers a series of unfortunate events unfolded at FedEx Field. Most notably starting quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick was sidelined with an injury 20 minutes into the game.

From there things went about as well as jaded WFT fans would expect: An exalted defense no-showed; Washington fumbled on its own 3-yard line; it missed a critical field goal and gave up 14 of 18 third-down conversions; and some fans were doused when a pipe broke at the stadium.

Insert your best garbage jokes here. Fortunately for several beleaguered fans a spokesperson for the team confirmed to ESPN's Washington reporter John Keim that the substance was rainwater -- not sewage -- and the fans' tickets were upgraded to suite level for the rest of the team's 20-16 loss to Justin Herbert & Co.

""The leak came from a storage tank filled with rainwater. We gave the fans in the section the option to move to a suite for the rest of the game and we're going to give them tickets to a game of their choice in the future.

Note: Language in the background of the following clip may be considered offensive.

Fans rushed away from the torrent in droves with some claiming the leak was from a sewage leak. Michael Phillips of the Richmond Times-Dispatch rushed to the scene and found a split verdict between sewage and water.

In the end FedEx Field which was opened in 1997 dispelled fears of a sewage leak asserting that the spill was actually rainwater. It didn't hurt that the fans were moved to luxury suites for the remainder of the game but doubts remained.

Rainwater or sewage the incident added plenty of fuel for the WFT social media critics and comics including those looking for any hints as to the team's new name.

Later Michael Phillips of the Richmond Times-Dispatch ambled over to the scene and reported that “some folks got ‘really wet'” during the incident. He also said there was some debate on what substance actually came out of the pipe.

Went over to see the burst pipe. Has mostly dried now. Some folks got ""really wet"" in the recounting of nearby patrons. Split verdict on whether it was sewage or not. Most felt it was just water.

Fun! So not only do you have to be prepared for possible COVID exposure at FedEx Field but you also have to watch out for urine and poop-colored water maybe falling from the sky.

Another notable game experience blunder occurred in 2014 when the team sold beer that “passed its freshness date.”

The Washington Football Team would go on to lose to the Chargers 20-16.

Then a statement somewhat in detail of a course to be pursued seemed fitting and proper. Now at the expiration of four years during which public declarations have been constantly called forth on every point and phase of the great contest which still absorbs the attention and engrosses the energies of the nation little that is new could be presented. The progress of our arms upon which all else chiefly depends is as well known to the public as to myself and it is I trust reasonably satisfactory and encouraging to all. With high hope for the future no prediction in regard to it is ventured.”

This speech packs a lot of meaning and yet it is the second shortest second inaugural address in American Presidential history. Only George Washington’s second inaugural speech was shorter (703 words vs. 135 words).When Lincoln gave the address it had been 32 years since a president was re-elected (Andrew Jackson 1833) in a country that was only 89 years old. This was newsworthy and increased the public’s interest in the event.Unlike previous second inaugural addresses Lincoln’s words are directed away from himself. Instead of words like “me” or “I” he uses more inclusive words like “all” or “both” to draw attention to his broader intent.The war is the focus of this section. Nine times in ninety-nine words Lincoln uses the word “war” and twice more he uses the word “it” to refer to the war. He presents the fact that neither side wanted the war but shows favor to the northern effort when he frankly states that “one side made war rather than let the nation survive and the other would accept war rather than let it perish.”“And the war came” suggests that those making the decisions of the past four years were not always in control. This parallels his thinking in a letter written in April 1864 where he credits a higher power in shaping the events of the war: “I claim not to have controlled events but confess plainly that events have controlled me.”

Here Lincoln names slavery as the cause of the war. This is a far cry from his First Inaugural Address where he attempted to calm the nation by reiterating his intentions of leaving slavery where it already existed. When Lincoln gave that address on March 4 1861 seven southern states had already seceded from the nation and civil war was imminent. Now after four years of a terrible national crisis Lincoln uses his Second Inaugural to gently but clearly call out slavery as the reason for the war.Another unique component of this inaugural speech is its use of Biblical verses and theological language. Lincoln provides quotes from the Bible four times mentions God 14 times and summons prayer three times. Throughout his presidency Lincoln struggled to comprehend the purpose of all the death and destruction and often turned to the Bible for answers.In this passage Lincoln expresses his own belief that the war was fought for God’s purposes; and that both sides used and misused the bible for their own purposes. In the first of four referenced biblical verses (Genesis 3:19) he is calling out Whites in the South who thought that God was on their side even as they ate bread that was harvested from the work and sweat of their Black slaves. And then he jumps right back to the Bible referencing the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 7:1) and asking Americans “but let us judge not that we be not judged.”

"" ‘Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh!’ If we shall suppose that American Slavery is one of those offences which in the providence of God must needs come but which having continued through His appointed time He now wills to remove and that He gives to both North and South this terrible war as the woe due to those by whom the offence came shall we discern therein any departure from those divine attributes which the believers in a Living God always ascribe to Him?”



“Offences” being slavery Lincoln uses the words of Jesus in Matthew 18:7 to make it clear that slavery was wrong - a sin. He surmises that God has used the “terrible war” to finally end this sin.



As an historical reminder Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation was issued in January 1863 as a wartime measure and it freed the enslaved people in the Confederate states. As commander-in-chief of the Federal Army he had the authority to take any step necessary to cripple the rebellion and keep the country united. In the backdrop of the Second Inaugural with the end of the war in sight Congress was working to pass a Constitutional amendment to permanently end slavery in the United States. With this in mind Lincoln is also using the address to promote the need for that amendment.



“Fondly do we hope ~ fervently do we pray ~ that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away. Yet if God wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by the bondsman's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword as was said three thousand years ago so still it must be said 'the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.”



In his First Inaugural address Lincoln frames the slavery issue from the perspective of a lawyer. He deliberately outlines what he and the federal government were not going to do about it. He was well aware then of the Constitutional constraints that gave Southern States the right to decide for themselves whether to allow slavery. In 1861 he was also trying to suppress the onset of a Civil War. Now after four devastating years of war and the country in the process of integrating newly-freed Blacks into society he takes slavery head-on. In this section of his Second Inaugural he does not hold back. He warns that the war will continue until “every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword” saying again that this is God’s will.",,,,,,,,,,,,

(Elaine Cromie/For The Washington Post)

Walbridge Ohio - On the outskirts of Toledo a short drive from Interstate 90 thousands of glass panels rumble along assembly lines at a factory that will help determine whether the Biden administration can meet two of its biggest goals - dramatically reducing carbon emissions and lessening reliance on China.

First Solar is one of the few U.S. solar-panel manufacturers in an industry dominated by Chinese factories some of which the Biden administration has accused of employing forced labor. Lately that has made First Solar particularly popular with panel buyers which have snapped up the company's entire production run through 2022.

Posters in the factory's lobby proudly declare that the company is ""countering China's state-subsidized dominance of solar supply chains"" while churning out products that are ""uniquely American"" and ""Ohio-made.""

The question now: Can First Solar and its smaller counterparts in the U.S. solar industry crank up enough manufacturing capacity to meet the administration's renewable energy goals or will U.S. power companies remain dependent on the massive Chinese solar industry despite concerns about how it operates?

The technology offers a high-profile test of the United States' ambition to re-shore manufacturing after years of losing ground to China's low-cost and state-subsidized factories. Since 2004 U.S. production of the photovoltaic cells that form solar panels has fallen from 13% of global supply to less than 1% while China's share has soared from less than 1% to 67% according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).

The Biden administration this past Wednesday renewed its commitment to dramatically expand solar energy as part of its goal of eliminating carbon emissions from electricity production by 2035. Large investments could increase solar from 3% of electricity generation today to 45% within three decades an Energy Department study concluded.

Solar is already the fastest-growing source of new electricity generation in the United States with power companies relying mostly on panels made by Chinese companies. The Biden administration says the rate of deployment must triple or quadruple if the nation is to hit the 2035 decarbonization goal.

But those plans are now running up against another White House priority: promoting human rights.

Customs and Border Protection this summer began blocking the import of solar panels that it believed could contain materials from Hoshine Silicon a Chinese company that it said appeared to be coercing workers from the persecuted Uyghur minority by threatening them or restricting their movement.

The Washington Post has reported that the company's factories in China's Xinjiang region have participated in state-sponsored programs that place Uyghurs in factory jobs -- placements that human rights researchers say workers cannot refuse. Hoshine has declined to comment and China has denied allegations about forced labor.

CBP officials have declined to say how many imports they may ultimately block but Hoshine is the world's largest manufacturer of a material used to produce silicon-based solar panels making it a ubiquitous industry supplier.

First Solar which last year supplied about 16% of panels deployed in the United States is confident it can play a bigger role and is aiming to roughly double its global production capacity by 2023.

""There's robust demand in the U.S. market and we're very well positioned to serve that demand"" chief executive Mark Widmar said in an interview.

But doubling its global output to about 17 gigawatts worth of panels a year still won't meet the current U.S. pace of solar-panel installation which could exceed 20 gigawatts this year. And First Solar's panels are designed for power-utility use not for residential rooftops.

Solar energy experts say they believe the United States will continue importing panels from China but that the volume could fall as the federal government enforces its ban and as some lawmakers push to cut Chinese-made panels out of federally funded energy projects.

Solar panels are made of semiconductor materials that convert sunlight into electricity. When light hits the panels electrons in the semiconductor material break free of their atoms and form an electric current. Different panels produce different levels of power ranging from about 300 watts to 600 watts per hour.

Chinese companies use silicon as their semiconductor and have built a vast supply chain to mine the material from quartz and turn it into panels.

Hefty state subsidies of Chinese solar companies helped drive many U.S. and European panel producers out of business a decade ago. First Solar which grew out of a predecessor company founded in the 1990s by University of Toledo scientist Harold McMaster was one of the few to hang on.

The company uses a different semiconductor compound called cadmium telluride applying it to glass panels in an ultrathin layer using a method developed by McMaster and his university colleagues. First Solar produces the compound out of byproducts from the mining of copper and zinc.

On a recent afternoon at the Ohio factory an endless line of glass panels traveled through machines that deposited layers of cadmium telluride and other materials.

The panels then rolled under lasers that carved grids into their surface to create individual cells that would help channel electric current out of the panel.

The whole process takes about four hours after which the panels are loaded onto trucks for mostly domestic delivery.

Just down the road First Solar is spending $680 million to build a new factory that will be twice as big bringing the company's total output in the United States to over 6 gigawatts worth of panels a year. Labor Secretary Marty Walsh last month attended a groundbreaking ceremony for the factory which the company said will create over 700 jobs.

""That'll make this the largest integrated solar complex in the world outside of mainland China"" Mike Koralewski the company's head of manufacturing said of the planned Toledo-area cluster which also includes a third facility that served as the original manufacturing plant.

The rising cost of shipping panels from Asia has helped make U.S.-produced panels more affordable compared with imports Widmar said. So have import tariffs levied by the Obama and Trump administrations to protect domestic manufacturers from China's state-subsidized solar industry.

Congress meanwhile has signaled it might offer further support for U.S. panel producers. An amendment incorporated into the $3.5 trillion budget resolution passed by the Senate last month would block Chinese components from federally funded renewable-energy projects. The Senate adopted the amendment by a vote of 90 to 9.

And Sen. Jon Ossoff D-Ga. and other Senate Democrats are proposing new tax credits for domestic solar manufacturers.

Solar-panel installers say they believe they'll be able to document that some Chinese suppliers are free of forced labor which should allow them to continue importing.

Chinese ""manufacturers are going into overdrive to make sure they can get all the details . . . to show they are clean completely down to time cards for the quartz miners"" said John Berger chief executive of Sunnova a residential solar-energy company in Houston. ""We are becoming increasingly confident we have no forced labor.""

The United States he added needs to figure out ""how to solve the [forced-labor] problem and not create another massive problem that gets in the way of decarbonization and addressing climate change.""

The U.S. Solar Energy Industries Association which represents panel installers and others has developed a ""traceability protocol"" that it says will ensure its members aren't buying components tied to forced labor. The group has tapped auditors with offices in China to monitor compliance.

But Laura T. Murphy a professor of human rights and contemporary slavery at Sheffield Hallam University in the United Kingdom who has reported on forced labor in China's solar industry expressed doubt that such audits would work given that Chinese authorities have pressured domestic companies not to comply with them.

""Right now I don't see how a company would feel confident that the information they are getting is providing certainty"" she said.

First Solar she added ""is not going to be able to supply the entire world with solar panels. However they do point to the fact that there are alternatives.""

The Clean Power Alliance a nonprofit that buys renewable energy from power generators and sells it to households and businesses in Southern California recently began requiring its electricity suppliers to sign contracts confirming that none of their components were made with forced labor.

""Besides being the right thing to do it is also reducing our risk"" said Natasha Keefer the group's director of power planning and procurement. ""We want [solar-energy] projects to be able to secure panel supply . . . having components that are getting detained is not conducive to us reducing our risk and the developers don't want that either.""

Widmar said he has urged customers to take similar action.

""There is one customer a utility here in the U.S. that made the decision to procure Chinese modules for a project we were bidding on"" Widmar said. ""After we were made aware of that I personally made a call to the head of their renewable energy unit and we talked about it. I said 'I want to be sure you understand the risks you may be taking.'

""My call made him go back to his team and after they did that . . . they made a decision to move that project over to us. This is becoming more and more of a concern and people just don't want to take the risk.""

— Two astronauts installed the mount for a new solar array outside of the International Space Station during the first spacewalk to not include an American or Russian crew member as one of the pair.



Akihiko Hoshide of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) and French astronaut Thomas Pesquet with the European Space Agency (ESA) both clad in U.S. spacesuits bearing their respective countries' flags on their left shoulders spent six hours and 54 minutes working in the vacuum of space on Sunday (Sept. 12). The extravehicular activity (EVA) began at 8:15 a.m. EDT (1215 GMT) when the two Expedition 65 crewmates switched their suits to battery power.



Exiting the U.S. Quest airlock Hoshide and Pesquet made their way to the port (or left-hand) side of the space station's backbone truss to a position referred to as P4. There they worked together to build a bracket structure called a modification kit and then mounted it to the mast canister at the base of one of the existing P4 solar arrays.



""Construction work!"" Pesquet exclaimed as he and Hoshide began the erector-set-like assembly of the bracket's first parts.

The kit prepared the site for the future installation and deployment of the third of six new International Space Station Roll-Out Solar Arrays (iROSAs). The array will upgrade one of the station's eight power channels known as 4A which provides partial power to the U.S. Destiny lab the Harmony node and European Columbus module.



A future spacewalk will add the P4/4A IROSA itself after its delivery to the space station by a SpaceX Dragon cargo flight in 2022.



The station's original solar arrays have begun to show signs of degradation as they reach and surpass their 15-year service life. The new roll-out solar arrays will be capable of increasing the station's electricity supply by 20 to 30 percent.



The same IROSA design is planned to power the elements of NASA's Gateway a lunar orbit outpost being developed by the agency's commercial and international partners.



After completing the mod kit's installation Hoshide and Pesquet replaced a floating point measurement unit a device used to measure the electrical charging potential of the station's arrays and their associated surfaces in its vicinity. Hoshide also removed and replaced a ""pip pin"" used to secure the airlock hatch.



With the scheduled tasks of the EVA achieved the two astronauts returned to the airlock to enter the space station. The spacewalk ended at 3:09 p.m. EDT (1909 GMT) when re-pressurization of the airlock began.



Hoshide and Pesquet's activities during the spacewalk were filmed using a special virtual reality (VR) camera as part of the ISS Experience an ongoing immersive production by Felix & Paul Studios in association with TIME. The custom 3D 360-degree space camera was positioned during the EVA by ground controllers using the station's Canadarm2 robotic arm.



The VR footage from the spacewalk will be returned to Earth on SpaceX's CRS-23 Dragon in late September.



NASA originally intended to conduct this spacewalk in August with Hoshide and U.S. astronaut Mark Vande Hei. Pesquet was added to the EVA team after Vande Hei suffered a pinched nerve in his neck. Still recovering Vande Hei supported the spacewalk from inside the station.



All U.S. operating segment (USOS) crew members including NASA JAXA and ESA astronauts are trained equally so spacewalker pairings usually hinge on the make up of the station's crew at any given time said NASA's deputy manager for the International Space Station Program Dana Weigel.



""The complement of crew members always has more NASA crew members so just statistically speaking it makes sense that you usually end up with a NASA crew member"" said Weigel in a pre-spacewalk briefing. ""There is no requirement for that and that's certainly not a ground rule for planning.""



With the inclusion of an additional crew member on U.S. commercial crew flights such as the Crew Dragon on which both Hoshide and Pesquet arrived in April the chances of another international partner spacewalk has increased said Weigel.



""Now that we have four USOS crew members on board — whereas when we were flying on [Russia's crew spacecraft] Soyuz we only had three — we have a higher likelihood of seeing something like this again"" she said.



Prior to Sunday's all-international EVA 14 astronauts from either ESA JAXA or the Canadian Space Agency have joined an American crew member on a total of 37 spacewalks. Hoshide and Pesquet's outing was the 244th spacewalk in support of assembly and maintenance of the International Space Station.



Hoshide served as extravehicular crew member one (EV1) and wore a spacesuit with red stripes. Pesquet was EV-2 wearing an unmarked suit. This was the fourth spacewalk for Hoshide and the sixth for Pesquet.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vc3R0aG9tYXNzb3VyY2UuY29tL2NvbnRlbnQvMjAyMS8wOS8xMi9jb2FsaXRpb24tZGlzdHJpYnV0ZXMtZmlyc3QtMjAtcG9ydGFibGUtc29sYXItZ2VuZXJhdG9ycy1pbi1zYXZhbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Coalition Distributes First 20 Portable Solar Generators in Savan,"Community Action Now teamed up with the Coalition for Solar Affordability Partnership on Saturday to distribute 20 portable solar powered generator units at the Romeo Malone Community Center in Savan.

St. Thomas residents who signed up for the Solarize St. Thomas “Share the Sun” campaign were able to save more than $1000 by paying $350 for a solar panel and portable generator unit.

“It’s a qualification. They have to meet a qualification income-based qualification to receive these systems” said Gwendolyn Hodge the center’s community coordinator.

The Share the Sun Affordable Solar Program is part of the Solarize St. Thomas campaign that works to reduce the high energy burden and provide resiliency during hurricanes and grid outrages for St. Thomas families and businesses. Customers of Solarize St. Thomas receive discounted rates through their group purchasing program. Grant funds are also available through the Share the Sun program.

Most residents who picked up their solar units Saturday said they need them because of WAPA’s expensive power rates and as a backup for the utility’s inconsistent power.

“I decided to purchase the solar panel because I had the opportunity and it would benefit me in my household when the power goes off” Jacqueline Francis said. “I have medical equipment that I utilize and this will help me to use the product when power goes off for long hours.”

“WAPA went out [a few days ago] for a whole day” Zelma Lettsome said. “If I had [the generator] I would’ve been able to cook I wouldn’t have been hot and I would’ve been able to do things I need electricity for.”

Yvonne Warner said that she signed up to receive the units “first and foremost because of WAPA. They don’t know what they’re doing.” And Monica Prosper said “They’re [WAPA] completely unreliable.”

Kai Frett works for Silver Sun Solar the company that purchased the systems and was present to instruct customers on how to properly install and use the solar units.

“It’s a simple plug and play” Frett said. “It’s a 100-watt panel and a 1800 watt generator. They can set it up anywhere that has sun.”

According to the coalition benefits of using solar power include lower electricity bills predictable cost of electricity no harmful emissions or pollutants and an available tax credit of 26 percent.

The Coalition for Solar Affordability is a local public-private coalition that involves the Rotary Club of St. Thomas east ECO Environmental Association of St. Thomas-St. John Virgin Islands Conservation Society the University of the Virgin Islands’ Caribbean Green Technology Center Virgin Islands Energy Office VI Electric Vehicle Association-North and Solar Crowdsource. The coalition received $150000 in funding from local civic philanthropic sources $50000 from Brad and Juli Camrud and $100000 from the Community Foundation of the Virgin Islands.

As long as the strings are the same length and orientation only certain shading patterns will cause problems. Namely when the optimal number of bypass diodes to be activated in each string differs resulting in different MPPT voltages.



For example if one string is completely unshaded and one string is uniformly partially shaded that's not a problem. All the PV cells involved are producing voltage; the partially shaded string will be producing less current but Vmpp doesn't change much with insolation so the two strings can operate at the same voltage reasonably efficiently.



But now suppose that one string is completely unshaded and the other string has 1/4 of the panels illuminated at 40% and 3/4s of the panel illuminated at 80%. The latter string could either be operated with all panels producing voltage and the current limited by the 40% illuminated panels to provide 40% power. Or it could be operated with the less illuminated panels having their bypass diodes activated so that only 3/4s of the panels are producing voltage to produce 60% power. Which is what it would do on its own MPPT. But if it is paralleled with a fully illuminated string it must operate at the same voltage with no bypass diodes activated so it will end up producing only 40% power.

US EVA-77 — the first US spacewalk to not involve an American — saw Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) astronaut and current ISS Commander Aki Hoshide and European Space Agency (ESA) astronaut Thomas Pesquet build a support bracket onto which a future solar array will be mounted.

Background

The ISS’s Solar Array Wings (SAWs) produce all the electrical power required by the station.

The first SAW on the P6 truss was launched on December 1 2000 (UTC) on the STS-97 mission of the Space Shuttle Endeavour. In the intervening 21 years expected degradation of the arrays means they produce less power than they did when they were first deployed.

The remaining SAWs for the ISS were delivered on three Space Shuttle missions: STS-115 in 2006 (P3/P4 truss) STS-117 in 2007 (S3/S4 truss) and STS-119 in 2009 (S6 truss).

The decreasing power ability of the arrays came against a backdrop of increasing demand from the station’s ever-increasing user base.

With a complete removal & replacement of the arrays not possible due to ISS construction and integration the ISS Power Augmentation program was formed to find a way to boost the station’s power output.

The program arrived at a plan to add six additional solar arrays called ISS Roll Out Solar Arrays (IROSAs) to the station to increase its power generation capability and bring it back near its original levels.

The IROSA is a new type of array technology for the station. Whereas the outpost’s original arrays deployed in an accordion-like manner the IROSAs roll out in a mat-like fashion from inside a cylindrical canister.

Their solar cells are mounted on a thin flexible blanket rather than traditional rigid panels and they feature a composite boom that adds rigidity and allows for deployment without the use of motors or complex mechanisms.

This allows the large arrays to be compactly stowed — which is important given the current launch vehicle options available to the ISS program.

The solar cells themselves are around 30% efficient compared to the 14% efficiency of the original arrays. This allows the IROSAs to generate roughly the same power as the originals despite being only half their size.

The IROSAs are being installed on top of six of the station’s existing solar arrays which will allow the IROSAs to utilize the existing sun-tracking motors of the current arrays and allow each IROSA to be connected to the electrical system currently used.

Although the IROSAs will partly shadow the existing arrays the originals will continue to generate power alongside the IROSAs.

Each IROSA will produce 20kW of power for a total of 120kW across all six arrays. When added to the output of the original arrays a combined total of 215kW of power will be available to the ISS close to its original level.

This represents an increase of nearly a third compared to the outpost’s current 160kW of available power and will ensure the ISS has adequate power to support its increasing demands throughout the remainder of its life.

Two IROSAs are already installed on channels 2B and 4B on the P6 truss having been launched on a pallet inside a SpaceX Cargo Dragon 2 trunk on the CRS-22 flight in June 2021 and installed via a series of spacewalks.

US EVA-77 officially began at 08:15 EDT (12:15 UTC) on September 12 when Aki and Thomas took their Extravehicular Mobility Units (EMUs or spacesuits) to battery power.

Each IROSA is structurally mounted to the base of the station’s existing Mast Canister Assemblies (MCAs) which housed the current arrays during launch and now serve as their base.

To provide a structural framework to mount the IROSAs to the MCAs a mod kit must first be installed. This kit consists of several struts which are connected and bolted to an MCA using existing attachment points.

For EVA-77 a mod kit was assembled and installed onto the channel 4A MCA located on the P4 truss.

The first task for Aki Hoshide (suit with red stripes) and Thomas Pesquet (full white suit) was to translate out to the P4 truss worksite whereupon they installed an A-frame like device called the upper bracket onto the 4A MCA.

A left lower strut and left mid strut were then connected between the upper bracket and the left side of the MCA and a right lower strut and right mid strut were also installed on the opposite side.

This was the same procedure used on previous spacewalks earlier this year to install mod kits onto the 2B and 4B MCAs on the P6 truss.

Once work to assemble the mod kit was complete the 4A solar array was ready for the arrival of a new IROSA on the SpaceX CRS-25 flight in May 2022.

After cleaning up the worksite Aki and Thomas completed one last final task of replacing a failed Floating Potential Measurement Unit (FPMU) on the P1 truss.

The FPMU is a device that measures the electrical charges which build up outside the ISS which can pose a threat to astronauts and electronic equipment. The antenna-like hardware will be replaced with a new unit.

The two astronauts then headed back inside the Quest airlock to conclude the EVA.

Overall US EVA-77 was the 244th spacewalk in support of construction outfitting and maintenance of the ISS the 14th EVA of the year (12 on ISS and 2 on the Chinese space station) and the 7th for Expedition 65.

'I think it's a possibility',"KANSAS CITY Mo. — Odell Beckham Jr. didn't play for the Browns in Sunday's 33-29 season-opening loss to the Kansas City Chiefs raising questions about when the star wide receiver will make his 2021 debut.

After the game coach Kevin Stefanski was asked whether Beckham could be ready for the home opener between the Browns and Houston Texans on Sunday at FirstEnergy Stadium.

""Yeah I think it's a possibility"" Stefanski said.

Beckham stretched and warmed up a bit before the game at Arrowhead Stadium and the Browns announced 90 minutes before kickoff he would be inactive.

""He worked out before the game and didn't feel like he could go a significant amount"" Stefanski said. ""So we felt like it was the right thing to do to keep him inactive and we had four wide receivers up.""

Beckham is on the comeback trail after suffering a season-ending torn anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee Oct. 25 against the Cincinnati Bengals and undergoing surgery Nov. 10.

Quick hits: Browns falter late against Chiefs lose 33-29 in Week 1

On Friday the Browns listed Beckham as questionable for the opener.

""He was 50-50 questionable and just didn't feel like he could go"" Stefanski said.

Jarvis Landry Beckham's close friend led the receiving corps with five catches on five targets for 71 yards and added a rushing touchdown.

Asked how tough Sunday was for Beckham Landry said ""I'm sure it was. I'm sure he wants to play. But we showed up with what we had.""

Donovan Peoples-Jones started in place of Beckham and had one catch on one target for 4 yards a slant on the Browns' final possession.

Rookie third-round pick Anthony Schwartz played a lot too and had three catches on five targets for 69 yards.

Rashard Higgins wasn't targeted.

Quarterback Baker Mayfield said he had been preparing for both potential outcomes with Beckham — the three-time Pro Bowl selection facing the Chiefs or sitting out.

""It’s a long season"" Mayfield said. ""We’ve got 16 more of these [regular-season games] and then whatever happens after that. So whenever he’s ready to come back and he feels he’s ready we’re going to welcome him in with open arms. But we trust the guys that we have out there. I thought our younger guys played well. So we just need to keep growing.""

The exit of Ford will benefit companies who are in the utility vehicle space they added.

At a time when Asian car makers have captured the market in the US it was nothing but natural for the American automobile companies - General Motors and now Ford - to sputter and stop in India if they get their basics wrong.

Ford India Private Ltd recently announced that it will wind down vehicle assembly in Sanand plant in Gujarat by the fourth quarter of 2021 and vehicle and engine manufacturing unit in Chennai by the second quarter of 2022.

""Simply put Ford did not read the Indian market correctly. In the late nineties and later small cars dominated the market. Maruti was ruling the roost and Hyundai Motor came and launched its Santro and captured a sizeable market"" an automobile industry expert told IANS preferring anonymity.

He also said Ford did not fully customise its car platforms. India is a right hand drive market whereas in the US it is left hand drive.

""Some of the Ford India's car models the owner-driver had to get down go around the vehicle open the left side door to unlock the boot certainly a tedious affair"" the expert pointed out.

""Different factors at different points of time played against Ford India and affected the company cumulatively. The three factors - product pricing and positioning -- were improved over the years. With Ford facing trouble globally it has to cut down its losses"" another industry official not wanting to be named told IANS.

For a long time the small car segment was the sweet spot for car makers in India.

Maruti Suzuki India Ltd and Hyundai Motor India Ltd cashed in on launching new models at different price points.

But Ford and General Motors failed to do so as they didn't have a small car in their global portfolio.

""Their initial attitude towards the Indian market was something like this - you ate the pizza and burger that were launched. So drive the model we offer. But the pizza and burger companies Indianised their products while the American car makers didn't do that"" the expert said.

Ford's American officials were confused when the media asked about the vehicle's mileage per litre as they were focussed on engine power. Ford looked at the Indian market through the US prism recalled a journalist.

Ford has been operating in India for over 20 years now. The company came in as a 50:50 joint venture partner with Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd and later increased its stakes.

The first car that was launched was the Ford Escort with an idea of having a product on the Indian roads rather than spending time designing one for the Indian market.

Later Ford India set up its plant near Chennai with the Tamil Nadu government offering attractive tax incentives like sales tax deferral for some years.

The first car that was rolled out of the Chennai plant was Ford Ikon.

Since then Ford India has been largely an 'one model' company that is only one model will log higher sales.

Meanwhile the Asian players like Maruti Suzuki and Hyundai Motor launched new models.

Ford India later added models like Figo Fusion Aspire EcoSport Endeavour and Freestyle.

""Though the number of vehicles sold in India rose manifold over the years the company has not been successful in gaining much market share in the passenger vehicles (PVs) segment. In FY2000 Ford sold 8000 PVs in India which grew to 93000 units in FY2019. But market share growth was negligible from 1.1 per cent in FY2000 to 2.8 per cent in FY2019. Volumes sold in FY2020 and FY2021 further fell to about 66000 and 48000 units respectively"" Vahishta Unwalla Lead Analyst-Industry Research Team Care Ratings Ltd told IANS.

Even as there was a huge capacity at its Chennai plant Ford India spent about $1 billion to set up a plant in Sanand in Gujarat.

""Without expanding the Chennai plant capacity by 30 per cent investing in a greenfield facility at a huge investment was a wrong strategy. A company runs into loss not only due to lack of sales but also due to its investment decisions"" V.G. Ramakrishnan Managing Partner Avanteum Advisors LLP told IANS.

According to Ford India the accumulated operating losses of more than $2 billion over the past 10 years and a $0.8 billion non-operating write-down of assets in 2019 has resulted in its decision to shut down its two plants.

""The investment was logical as per the plans that the company had at that point of time. But it didn't work out later"" a Ford India official told IANS.

According to Ramakrishnan Ford didn't have a product for the market.

""Global companies first draw out a product plan for a country say India plans. Then it becomes part of the Asia Pacific product plan and then the global product plan"" Ramakrishnan said.

Viewing the Indian market from the global level the numbers might not have been encouraging for developing a new product for Ford.

It was not so for others. For Suzuki Motor of Japan India was a major market while Hyundai Motor made India as a global production hub for small cars.

According to Unwalla nearly half of the units that Ford sold in India were utility vehicles with popular model offerings like Ecosport and Endeavour. Within the multi-utility vehicle segment Ford's share peaked to 9.5 per cent in FY2015 but started falling in all successive years. In FY21 this fell to 3.3 per cent.

""However the market share in the utility vehicle segment of competitors like Maruti Suzuki India Ltd grew from 12.4 per cent in FY2015 to 21.6 per cent in FY2021. Also Hyundai Motor India Ltd market share grew from 0.3 per cent in FY2015 to 20.2 per cent in FY2021. Hence this shows that Ford has been unsuccessful in gaining or maintaining its market share"" Unwalla added.

With Ford India not a major player in any car segment its absence will not result in any substantial windfall for other players.

According to Unwalla companies in the utility vehicle space like Maruti Suzuki Hyundai Motor Kia Motors India Pvt Ltd and Tata Motors Ltd shall benefit by the exit of Ford India.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5kdHZwcm9maXQuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL3doeS11cy1jYXJtYWtlci1mb3JkLWlzLXNodXR0aW5nLW1hbnVmYWN0dXJpbmctcGxhbnRzLWluLWluZGlhLTI1MzY1NzjSAW5odHRwczovL3d3dy5uZHR2cHJvZml0LmNvbS9hbXAvYnVzaW5lc3Mvd2h5LXVzLWNhcm1ha2VyLWZvcmQtaXMtc2h1dHRpbmctbWFudWZhY3R1cmluZy1wbGFudHMtaW4taW5kaWEtMjUzNjU3OA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why US Carmaker Ford Motor Is Shutting Manufacturing Plants In India,"Ford is the fifth automaker which has announced to stop manufacturing in India after MAN Trucks General Motors Harley Davidson and UM Motorcycles. Also Honda Cars India shut its facility in Greater Noida Uttar Pradesh. The Japanese carmaker discontinued its CR-V and Civic models in the country. However Honda has another facility (Tapukara plant) in Rajasthan which continues to be operational.



Here's why Ford decided to end manufacturing in India:



* Weak demand: Ford said it accumulated operating losses of more than $2 billion in 10 years in India and demand for its new vehicles had been weak. Ford India head Anurag Mehrotra said ""Despite (our) efforts we have not been able to find a sustainable path forward to long-term profitability.""



* Low-cost cars: India's car market is mainly dominated by cars from Maruti Suzuki India and Hyundai Motor India. Ford on the other hand struggled for years to turn profitable in India. Ford and Hyundai entered India in the mid-1990s. But the two companies have a complete different fate when it came to business. While Hyundai turned into the country's second-largest player and Ford is shutting down its manufacturing ops.

But U.S.-based automakers also sold quite a few lemons and four-wheeled disasters. Here are the worst six of them.

Introduced for the 1971 model year the Pinto was the first subcompact produced by Ford in North America. The company's answer to the growing popularity of Japanese imports such as the Toyota Corolla the Pinto was developed in just 25 months at the time when the industry average was 43 months.The Pinto became popular due to its fairly nice design low price and extensive options list but it had one major issue. Due to a lack of structural reinforcement in the rear the car was prone to fuel leakage and fire in the event of a rear-end collision. This became apparent when Pintos started turning into fireballs and people started getting killed after low-speed crashes.Ford recalled 1.5 million vehicles in 1978 the largest in automotive history at the time. However it was all too late as lawsuits were already pouring in and Ford spent millions of dollars settling court cases. Ironically it was still cheaper than modifying the Pinto's fuel system to reduce fire risk.Having spent almost 50 years at the top of America's luxury market Cadillac was having trouble adjusting to the late 1970s market when consumers were moving toward European imports and smaller sedans. So GM decided to develop a four-door smaller than the Seville in an effort to compete with the up-and-coming Mercedes-Benz BMW and Audi compacts.But while all the other Cadillacs had unique designs in the GM lineup the Cimarron was mostly a rebadged Chevrolet Cavalier. It was also powered by a lazy four-cylinder engine for three years until Cadillac added a V6 to the lineup. With disappointing sales that barely exceeded 20000 units per year from 1982 to 1987 the Cimarron was discontinued in 1988.An overpriced Chevrolet that had nothing to do with a Cadillac beyond the badge the Cimarron remains to this day the brand's biggest flop. Yup it's even worse than the Opel Omega-based Catera.Cadillac wasn't the only GM brand struggling in the 1970s. Oldsmobile had also lost its identity and it was living off badge-engineered nameplates. But this wasn't the only issue with the fourth-generation Cutlass Supreme.With most American manufacturers focusing on downsizing and fuel efficiency General Motors decided to use Oldsmobile to introduce diesel engines to the American market. When the fourth-gen midsize debuted in 1978 it was available with a 4.3-liter V8 oil burner.But the diesel was far from reliable and to top it all off a decline in gasoline prices made them less desirable in the early 1980s. Oldsmobile eventually developed a more durable 5.7-liter V8 but it was already too late. Almost 40 years later and U.S. buyers still aren't fond of oil burners. And GM's ill-fated diesel may be the one to blame.Unlike other cars listed here the Edsel wasn't all that terrible but a rather poor display of marketing. The brand named after the son of company founder Henry Ford was established in 1956 to bridge the gap between the affordable Ford vehicles and the mid-range Mercury products. And to make sure it debuts with a bang FoMoCo spent a lot of cash on its pre-introduction publicity campaign.Ford promised an ""entirely new kind of car"" but on ""E Day"" people saw a range of vehicles that shared most of their underpinnings and body parts with other Ford models. In addition the front-end design looked strange and the cars were almost as expensive as their Mercury counterparts.While Edsel introduced a few new features including automatic lubrication and self-adjusting rear brakes the brand didn't bring all that many customers into dealerships. To make matters worse it had to compete with brands like Pontiac Oldsmobile Buick Dodge and DeSoto without having an established brand image. Ford eventually decided to discontinue Edsel only three years later. The ordeal cost Ford a whopping $250 million.While working at Ford Lee Iacocca started a friendship with Alejandro de Tomaso which led to the creation of the De Tomaso Pantera . More than 10 years later Iacocca and De Tomaso teamed up again to create an Italian-American grand tourer. This time around Iacocca was heading Chrysler while De Tomaso was the owner of Maserati.The result was the Chrysler TC a LeBaron redesigned by Maserati and assembled in Italy. Developed as an image builder that would give Chrysler an exciting product the TC was a failure that was discontinued after only a couple of years on the market.What killed it? Well it was a mix of poor styling mundane performance and expensive pricing. Many critics also argued that the Chrysler TC looked too similar to the LeBaron GTC convertible that was notably more affordable and came with similar features.Chrysler sold only 7300 TCs over three model years. In 2019 Bob Lutz revealed that the TC project cost Chrysler almost $600 million which results in a cost of $80000 to produce each car. That's about $160000 in 2021.Often called the ""worst car in history"" the Yugo GV was a subcompact hatchback manufactured by Yugoslavian automaker Zastava. Introduced in 1980 as a shortened variant of the Fiat 128 the Yugo was marketed in the United States from 1985 to 1992 by Malcolm Bricklin.Priced at only $4000 the Yugo was actually off to a great start in North America with more than 1000 cars sold in a single day. The Eastern European hatchback moved more than 48000 units in 1987 but things went sour when serious quality issues began to surface. The car was also painfully slow and performed poorly in all crash tests.The Yugo became the laughing stock of the car industry and sales plummeted hard toward the 1990s. The final blow came in 1992 when Yugo America went bankrupt during the Yugoslav civil war and the United Nations issued a trade embargo on Serbia.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcHJpbnQuaW4vb3Bpbmlvbi9maXJzdC1nbS1ub3ctZm9yZC13aHktaW5kaWEtaXMtYmVjb21pbmctYS1ncmF2ZXlhcmQtZm9yLXdvcmxkcy1hdXRvLWdpYW50cy83MzE3MTEv0gFyaHR0cHM6Ly90aGVwcmludC5pbi9vcGluaW9uL2ZpcnN0LWdtLW5vdy1mb3JkLXdoeS1pbmRpYS1pcy1iZWNvbWluZy1hLWdyYXZleWFyZC1mb3Itd29ybGRzLWF1dG8tZ2lhbnRzLzczMTcxMS8_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,First GM now Ford — why India is becoming a graveyard for world’s auto giants,"If you leave out Hyundai which has become a bigger car manufacturer than Ford and General Motors (by numbers not value) the top four global makers of automobiles command barely 6 per cent of the Indian passenger vehicle market. Among them General Motors (GM) left India four years ago. Ford’s announced exit now will make little difference since it has less than 2 per cent of the market. And the global No. 1 (Volkswagen) together with its Skoda subsidiary has barely 1 per cent. Of the big four Toyota has been the most successful but has barely 3 per cent of the market. And recall that even Toyota while complaining of high taxes announced a halt last year to further investment in India before quickly retracting. Regardless it has stopped the production of two three-box models the Etios and Corolla Altis. Honda on its part has stopped the production of the Civic and Accord.

So why is India becoming a graveyard for the world’s auto majors? One answer is that the Indian car market is no longer what it once promised to be its global ranking expected to move from fourth to third — again measured by vehicle numbers not value. Instead it has slipped to fifth (overtaken by Germany) because the market levelled off and then shrank for two years before recovering this financial year. This is part of the larger story about the loss of momentum in India’s consumer markets.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVxdWl0eXBhbmRpdC5jb20vZm9yZC1tb3RvcnMtZGVwYXJ0dXJlLWZyb20taW5kaWEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ford Motors Ends Its Journey in India,"Ford Motors has announced it will end manufacturing cars immediately and nearly 4000 employees will be affected. Ford sold 15818 vehicles through the April-August season while Honda Motors and Hyundai Motor sold 33103 and 209407 units data published by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers showed.



An official told over $35 billion investments had been done in India in the last six years including $4.4 billion in new assets by 13 businesses. For example Toshiba-Suzuki-Denso backed $820 million to start advanced chemistry cell battery storage production at Hansalpur Gujarat.



“India is a different market for vehicles. You require to deliver a product that people desire. Ford failed to meet the market and that’s the reason for their exit” he said. “But they have agreed to take care of the employees and consumers who have purchased their cars. They are also working on expanding research and development in India even after closing the manufacturing units” he added.

#1 Jobs will be Affected

The decision by Ford is a blow to PM Modi’s Make-in-India concept which encourages companies to manufacture locally.



Production of Ford’s cars in India will stop immediately and affect almost 4000 employees the company told in a report. Ford will shut down an assembly plant in Gujarat by the fourth quarter also vehicle and engine manufacturing plants in Chennai by the next quarter.



Chief Executive Officer Jim Farley has said that he will no longer issue capital toward marginal markets that give little or no return. In January Ford said it would close more than a century of production in Brazil and took a $4.1 billion charge.



“We are taking tough but necessary actions to give a viably profitable business longer-term and allot our capital to improve and create value in the best areas. Despite funding more than enough in India Ford has suffered more than $2 billion of operating losses in the last ten years and the call for new vehicles has been much lower than budget” Farley said in a statement.

In a report Ford announced it will expand the restructuring cost in many years charging $600 million this year $1.2 billion in 2022 and the remaining in the upcoming years. The automaker restated it sees global restructuring costs this year of almost $2.2 billion and $2.7 billion before interest and taxes.

#2 Tough Market

Foreign automakers have found it challenging to gain a space in the value-conscious Indian market ruled by Maruti Suzuki India Ltd.’s cars. The government’s high tax conditions which charges 28 per cent on gasoline vehicles.

Toyota Motor last year said it wouldn’t grow further in India because of high taxes and Harley-Davidson has left the market. While General Motors also left in 2017. Ford India had a market portion of just 1.42 per cent in August data from the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations showed.



Ford was one of the first car companies to open a store in India when the economy began in the early 1990s. The company initially set up shop in 1926 but closed down its first operation in the 1950s. Following the factory closings Ford will import and trade some vehicles like Mustang coupes Figo EcoSport and Endeavour will close once existing inventory at dealers is sold.

#3 Uncertain future

The decision questions the future of the EcoSport small SUV in the US which the company had been shipping from India. Ford launched the design in the US in 2018 but it has had little benefit. Sales are below 22 per cent in the US this time.



Ford examined several options in India like partnerships collaborative platforms and contract production with other carmakers before shutting down factories in India. It is still looking for a possibility of selling its manufacturing factories in the country."

Meanwhile as Apple grapples with controversy over its proposed—but now paused—plans to scan iPhones for child sexual abuse material WhatsApp moved this week to plug its biggest end-to-end encryption loophole. The ubiquitous secure communication platform can't peek at your messages at any point on their digital journey but if you back up your chats on a third-party cloud service like iCloud or Google Cloud the messages are no longer end-to-end encrypted. With some clever cryptography the service was finally able to devise a method for the encrypting the backup before it's sent to the cloud for storage.

After handing an activist's IP address over to law enforcement the secure email service ProtonMail said this week that it is updating its policies to make it more clear what customer metadata it can be legally compelled to collect.

The Russian tech giant Yandex said this week that in August and September it was hit with the internet's largest-ever recorded distributed denial-of-service or DDoS attack. The flood of junk traffic meant to overwhelm systems and take them down peaked on September 5 but Yandex successfully defended against even that largest barrage. “Our experts did manage to repel a record attack of nearly 22 million requests per second” the company said in a statement. “This is the biggest known attack in the history of the internet.”

A Russian national thought to work with the notorious malware gang TrickBot was arrested last week at Seoul international airport. Known only as Mr. A in local media the man was attempting to fly to Russia after spending more than a year and a half in South Korea. After arriving in February 2020 Mr. A was trapped in Seoul because of international travel restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. During this time his passport expired and Mr. A had to get an apartment in Seoul while working with the Russian embassy on a replacement. Concurrently United States law enforcement officials opened an investigation into TrickBot's activity particularly related to a botnet the group developed and used to aid a rash of 2020 ransomware attacks. During the investigation officials gathered evidence of Mr. A's alleged work with TrickBot including possible 2016 development of a malicious browser tool.

A bug in the United Kingdom version of McDonald's Monopoly VIP game exposed usernames and passwords for the game's databases to all winners. The flaw caused data about both the game's production and staging servers to show up in prize redemption emails. The exposed information included Microsoft Azure SQL database details and credentials. A winner who received the credentials likely couldn't have logged into the production server because of a firewall but could have accessed the staging server and potentially grabbed winning codes to redeem more prizes.

Hackers published 500000 Fortinet VPN credentials usernames and passwords apparently collected last summer from vulnerable devices. The bug they exploited to collect the data has since been patched but some of the stolen credentials may still be valid. This would allow bad actors to log into organizations' Fortinet VPNs and access their networks to install malware steal data or launch other attacks. The data dump published by a known ransomware gang offshoot called “Orange” was posted for free. “CVE-2018-13379 is an old vulnerability resolved in May 2019” Fortinet said in a statement to Bleeping Computer. “If customers have not done so we urge them to immediately implement the upgrade and mitigations.”

20 YEARS SINCE 9/11 TUNNEL TO TOWERS CEO FRANK SILLER COMPLETES 537-MILE ‘NEVER FORGET WALK’

On the morning of September 11 Stephen Siller was driving home from an overnight shift. He had planned to spend the day golfing but after hearing the news he headed toward the Twin Towers. The entrance of the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel was closed so he instead ran to the scene with his 60 pounds of gear. Siller is survived by his wife Sally and five children.

Frank Siller recently completed his 537-mile walk through six states in six weeks as part of the Tunnel to Towers Foundation's ""Never Forget Walk.""

Leno’s edition of the durable game show bows Sept. 13 in syndication distributed by Fox Corp.’s Fox First Run division.

The veteran comedian has been offered hosting gigs on many game shows over the years but Leno didn’t have much interest in a show with a lot of involved game play. The highlight of the original “YBYL” — which began on radio in 1947 and expanded to TV on NBC for a decade-long run from 1950 to 1961 — was always Marx’s famously fast zingers and his banter with everyday contestants. That made it a perfect fit for Leno who sees it as a version of his longtime person-on-the-street interview segment “Jaywalking” that aired on “Tonight Show” during his 22-year run at NBC.

“This is a comedy show with a kind of tenuous connection to a game” Leno told Variety.

As with the original contestants will be everyday people but with offbeat personalities unusual occupations and other colorful characteristics that Leno will explore. Another aspect of the original that will be retained is the low value of the cash winnings available to contestants. The small amount of money at stake also helps make for a lighter mood. The most a contestant can win is about $5500.

“It’s not life-changing money. It’s month-changing money” Leno quipped.

Tom Werner who is executive producer of “YBYL” reinforced that the contestants and their interaction with Leno is the crux of the show. Producers are focused on finding “interesting and likeable” people from all over the country he said. Werner and his former partner Marcy Carsey previously produced a version of “YBYL” in syndication hosted by the now-disgraced comedian Bill Cosby that ran for one season in syndication in 1992-93.

“My favorite moment so far is when Jay asked a contestant to name the four Presidents on Mount Rushmore. She said ‘Washington Jefferson Lincoln and Roosevelt.’ Jay then asked ‘Which Roosevelt?’ The woman responded ‘There’s more than one?'” Werner said.

Yes there will still be a “Secret Word” of the day — a pre-selected term that if stated by a contestant brings them $500 — but no it won’t be announced by a Groucho-styled duck puppet lowered down on a wire as in the original series.

One new touch will be a spin-the-wheel game dubbed “The Rodney Run” in honor of fast-talking comedian Rodney Dangerfield that will involve contestants trying to speed through a series of jokes.

“What makes this show fun is the combination of Jay Leno’s comedy with the pairing of two strangers each with their own unique stories working together to win money and prizes” said David Hurwitz showrunner and executive producer.

Leno is unabashedly looking forward to working in a comedic style and tone that is appropriate to early evening rather than late-night or comedy clubs. Especially given the troubled times Leno’s aim is to deliver good clean fun.

“There’s no politics here. We just want everyone to be laughing at the end” Leno said. “That was a real selling point to station managers in the Midwest — no politics. Everybody’s so angry. We need to see more fun on TV.”

The return of “YBYL” also marks a reunion for Leno and his longtime “Tonight Show” bandleader Kevin Eubanks. Eubanks will serve as a co-host with Leno and he penned the show’s new theme song. The two were not at all surprised to see that they easily returned to their old groove even after a long break.

“There’s a natural ebb and flow” to working with Eubanks Leno said. “Comedy and jazz are a lot alike. It’s all about timing and you never do it the same way twice.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9tYXJrZXRzL2FwcGxlLWlwaG9uZS0xMy1pbmZsYXRpb24tZGF0YS1ibGlua2VuLWFmZ2hhbmlzdGFuLXdlZWstYWhlYWTSAWVodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3hidXNpbmVzcy5jb20vbWFya2V0cy9hcHBsZS1pcGhvbmUtMTMtaW5mbGF0aW9uLWRhdGEtYmxpbmtlbi1hZmdoYW5pc3Rhbi13ZWVrLWFoZWFkLmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Apple iPhone 13 inflation data and Blinken Afghanistan hearing top week ahead,"Fresh inflation data will have investors on pins and needles in the coming week after stocks ended Friday by notching a fifth day of losses and producer prices surging 8.3% annually — the most on record.

We focus on the active and ongoing construction of the Ronald O. Perelman Performing Arts Center St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church and the current state of Two and Five World Trade Center. All of which are or are around the former trapezoidal superblock that held six of the original World Trade Center buildings bound by West Vesey Church and Liberty Streets.

The most noticeable aspect of construction is happening at the Ronald O. Perelman Performing Arts Center. Designed by REX with Davis Brody Bond Architects as the executive architect and developed by an independent non-profit company called The Perelman the 138-foot-tall venue is seeing the tight array of black perimeter columns going up and around the perimeter of the topped-out steel superstructure. These critical components will soon hold up the light-colored marble exterior. It’s conceivable to see the first few segments of the uniform stone facade installed before the end of the year. Sciame Construction LLC is in charge of building the structure which is scheduled to open in 2023.

Progress on this outer portion of the performing arts center began around mid-July on the northern elevation facing Vesey Street and gradually made its way southward toward the south wall facing the two reflecting pools of the Twin Towers.

Below are several renderings made by LUXIGON REX and Rockwell Group that give us a sneak peak of what the main lobby the performance venues outdoor terraces and how the marble will look up close and from afar. You can see the other depictions in an earlier YIMBY article.

Our next look takes us to the static state of Two World Trade Center aka 200 Greenwich Street that’s bound by Vesey Street to the north Church Street to the east Fulton Street Greenwich Street to the west. and the Oculus designed by Santiago Calatrava to the south. It was last reported that Norman Foster of Foster + Partners is revamping his former four diamond-topped design that was initially revealed in 2006. Bjarke Ingels then revealed his office supertall iteration during the summer of 2015 with a series of landscaped stepped setbacks and cantilevering glass boxes. However Silverstein Properties is bringing back Foster with the eyes of the world awaiting to finally get a glimpse of the British architect’s future 1350-foot-tall New York landmark. The architectural height would be only 18 feet shy of One World Trade Center’s roof line but from afar the two office supertalls would look nearly identical in roof height. Construction remains stalled at only one story since the early 2010’s with exposed mechanical systems corrugated steel and equipment colorfully spray painted by various commissioned artists in the past couple of years. On the eastern end of the parcel is a public beer garden while running north and south down the center of the property are doors leading down to the Westfield World Trade Center mall the PATH trains the subterranean walkway extending under West Street toward Brookfield Place and subway access to the 2 3 A C E R and W trains. A recent update seen on The Real Deal indicated that Silverstein Properties is seeing interest from tech and finance companies eyeing the planned office tower and hopes to resume construction in the next six to twelve months.

Resting atop Liberty Park is Santiago Calatrava‘s topped-out St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church. More of the white marble panels for the walls and dome are carefully being lifted and mounted in place. Steel-framed crates can be seen along Greenwich and Liberty Streets each holding a handful of marble panels. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is developing the church and is predicted to be finished sometime next year. Check out our early August update when installation began on the first parts of the marble dome.

Finally we look at Five World Trade Center aka 130 Liberty Street. Updated renderings first revealed in February showcased a 900-foot-tall design by Kohn Pedersen Fox that The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey selected as the winning bid at a board meeting last winter. Silverstein Properties Brookfield Properties Omni New York LLC and Dabar Development Partners would lease the 1.56 million-square-foot mixed-use skyscraper under a 99-year ground lease. The site today is currently owned by the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation and is bound by the elevated Liberty Park and St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church to the north Greenwich Street to the east Albany Street to the south and Washington Street to the west. Within the property is an open-air parking lot for security vehicles a narrow public park and no sign of clearing the site for construction yet. But when that moment in time arrives the edifice would rise out of the former home of the 39-story Deustsche Bank Building which was heavily damaged by falling debris from the south tower on 9/11 and was fully demolished at the end of January 2011. Five World Trade Center will feature 190000 square feet of office space a 12000-square-foot community facility space 55000 square feet of public amenity space 7000 square feet of retail space and 1.2 million square feet of residential space divided into 1325 apartments. Of these 330 or 25 percent of the total inventory will be devoted to affordable housing. Construction is expected to begin sometime in 2023 and be complete by 2028.

It remains unclear as to when the entire rebuilding process of the World Trade Center will finally come to a much long-awaited conclusion. Numerous factors include many architecturally radical designs economic and political shifts technological innovations and interactions with people across the world a global pandemic and the concerning environmental and climate changes in recent years will all continue to contribute to the final outcome of the master plan. YIMBY hopes to see this historically significant section of New York real estate complete its rebirth by the end of the 2020’s and fully fill in the final gaps of the iconic Lower Manhattan skyline.

Clemens opened by remarking on his reaction to hearing many people’s accounts of the attacks on 9/11 especially the now-grown children of the victims.

""For me just hearing from the 20-year-old kids that had lost their parents throughout all this has been really a treat for me to hear now that they are young adults and it’s something we’ve got to continue to keep the younger generation aware of like I said so you never forget. Again to hear their stories is remarkable"" Clemens said.

""It really is a powerful testament to the legacy of the people we lost that day"" Scott remarked.

The ""Fox Report"" host also noted that Clemens was originally supposed to pitch the night of September 11 2001 but since then he has worked to help organizations like Helping the Heroes Foundation. Clemens then recounted where he was during the moment of the attacks.

""Well I was supposed to pitch the night of 9/11 when everything happened. I was woken by a friend of mine at our building that’s not too far from the World Trade area and we went up to the top floor and saw what had happened. We thought it was a smaller plane or an accident and then obviously within 20 30 minutes we knew well it was a terrorist attack and we were being attacked. Our nation was being attacked and everything kind of changed from there"" Clemens said.

He then described the first game the Yankees played following 9/11 noting ""there wasn’t a dry eye in Chicago"" when they played. More importantly he was glad that they could ""take a lot of the fans’ minds off what was going on.""

""Mike Piazza hit an unbelievable home run and really was able to take a lot of the fans’ minds off what was going on and back to baseball a little bit. I got an opportunity to pitch again and got my 20th win at the time but there wasn’t a dry eye in Chicago"" Clemens said.

While Clemens remarked that returning to New York after the game was ""one of the hardest things"" he had to do he also recalled other moments such as watching the first pitch made by former President George W. Bush.

""When we came back to play the World Series game 3 in Yankees Stadium President Bush 43 came out to throw out the first pitch and I think everyone has seen the video of him with a bullet-proof vest on wind up and throw a perfect strike down Broadway. And the whole place lit up. I was in the bullpen with Mel Stottlemyre the pitching coach and I stopped warming up and asked Mel to turn around with me so we could watch"" Clemens described.

""We had the perfect seat"" he said. ""Fifty-five thousand people so it was great."""

Saturday marked 20 years since the terror attacks that forever changed America.

The donation will support injured first responders military heroes and their families.

Tunnel to Towers CEO Frank Siller brother of the fallen 9/11 hero joined ""The Five"" Saturday to remember Stephen's sacrifice and to react to the donation. Although he had just completed a 537-mile trek through six states in six weeks as part of the Tunnel to Towers Foundation's ""Never Forget Walk"" after hearing the news he said he felt ""a million times better.""

""I don't know what we would do without Fox and that is the absolute truth"" Siller added Sunday on ""Fox & Friends"" noting that the money will help his organization pay off some mortgages of those who died from 9/11 illnesses.

20 YEARS SINCE 9/11 TUNNEL TO TOWERS CEO FRANK SILLER COMPLETES 537-MILE ‘NEVER FORGET WALK’

On the morning of September 11 Stephen Siller was driving home from an overnight shift. He had planned to spend the day golfing but after hearing the news he headed toward the Twin Towers. The entrance of the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel was closed so he instead ran to the scene with his 60 pounds of gear. Siller is survived by his wife Sally and five children.

Frank Siller recently completed his 537-mile walk through six states in six weeks as part of the Tunnel to Towers Foundation's ""Never Forget Walk."" He began at the Pentagon made his way to Shanksville Pennsylvania  and on Saturday finished the walk by retracing his brother's footsteps in lower Manhattan.

To retrace his brother's steps Siller said ""meant everything in the world"" to him.

Siller continued his efforts by honoring the lives of those who died from 9/11 related illnesses who he called ""9/12 families"" by reading out their names on Sunday. They too deserve to be remembered he said noting that they died from the same terror attack as his brother.

Leno’s edition of the durable game show bows Sept. 13 in syndication distributed by Fox Corp.’s Fox First Run division.

The veteran comedian has been offered hosting gigs on many game shows over the years but Leno didn’t have much interest in a show with a lot of involved game play. The highlight of the original “YBYL” — which began on radio in 1947 and expanded to TV on NBC for a decade-long run from 1950 to 1961 — was always Marx’s famously fast zingers and his banter with everyday contestants. That made it a perfect fit for Leno who sees it as a version of his longtime person-on-the-street interview segment “Jaywalking” that aired on “Tonight Show” during his 22-year run at NBC.

“This is a comedy show with a kind of tenuous connection to a game” Leno told Variety.

As with the original contestants will be everyday people but with offbeat personalities unusual occupations and other colorful characteristics that Leno will explore. Another aspect of the original that will be retained is the low value of the cash winnings available to contestants. The small amount of money at stake also helps make for a lighter mood. The most a contestant can win is about $5500.

“It’s not life-changing money. It’s month-changing money” Leno quipped.

Tom Werner who is executive producer of “YBYL” reinforced that the contestants and their interaction with Leno is the crux of the show. Producers are focused on finding “interesting and likeable” people from all over the country he said. Werner and his former partner Marcy Carsey previously produced a version of “YBYL” in syndication hosted by the now-disgraced comedian Bill Cosby that ran for one season in syndication in 1992-93.

“My favorite moment so far is when Jay asked a contestant to name the four Presidents on Mount Rushmore. She said ‘Washington Jefferson Lincoln and Roosevelt.’ Jay then asked ‘Which Roosevelt?’ The woman responded ‘There’s more than one?'” Werner said.

Yes there will still be a “Secret Word” of the day — a pre-selected term that if stated by a contestant brings them $500 — but no it won’t be announced by a Groucho-styled duck puppet lowered down on a wire as in the original series.

One new touch will be a spin-the-wheel game dubbed “The Rodney Run” in honor of fast-talking comedian Rodney Dangerfield that will involve contestants trying to speed through a series of jokes.

“What makes this show fun is the combination of Jay Leno’s comedy with the pairing of two strangers each with their own unique stories working together to win money and prizes” said David Hurwitz showrunner and executive producer.

Leno is unabashedly looking forward to working in a comedic style and tone that is appropriate to early evening rather than late-night or comedy clubs. Especially given the troubled times Leno’s aim is to deliver good clean fun.

“There’s no politics here. We just want everyone to be laughing at the end” Leno said. “That was a real selling point to station managers in the Midwest — no politics. Everybody’s so angry. We need to see more fun on TV.”

The return of “YBYL” also marks a reunion for Leno and his longtime “Tonight Show” bandleader Kevin Eubanks. Eubanks will serve as a co-host with Leno and he penned the show’s new theme song. The two were not at all surprised to see that they easily returned to their old groove even after a long break.

“There’s a natural ebb and flow” to working with Eubanks Leno said. “Comedy and jazz are a lot alike. It’s all about timing and you never do it the same way twice.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9tYXJrZXRzL2FwcGxlLWlwaG9uZS0xMy1pbmZsYXRpb24tZGF0YS1ibGlua2VuLWFmZ2hhbmlzdGFuLXdlZWstYWhlYWTSAWVodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3hidXNpbmVzcy5jb20vbWFya2V0cy9hcHBsZS1pcGhvbmUtMTMtaW5mbGF0aW9uLWRhdGEtYmxpbmtlbi1hZmdoYW5pc3Rhbi13ZWVrLWFoZWFkLmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Apple iPhone 13 inflation data and Blinken Afghanistan hearing top week ahead,"Fresh inflation data will have investors on pins and needles in the coming week after stocks ended Friday by notching a fifth day of losses and producer prices surging 8.3% annually — the most on record.

It remains unclear as to when the entire rebuilding process of the World Trade Center will finally come to a much long-awaited conclusion. Numerous factors include many architecturally radical designs economic and political shifts technological innovations and interactions with people across the world a global pandemic and the concerning environmental and climate changes in recent years will all continue to contribute to the final outcome of the master plan. YIMBY hopes to see this historically significant section of New York real estate complete its rebirth by the end of the 2020’s and fully fill in the final gaps of the iconic Lower Manhattan skyline.

Clemens opened by remarking on his reaction to hearing many people’s accounts of the attacks on 9/11 especially the now-grown children of the victims.

""For me just hearing from the 20-year-old kids that had lost their parents throughout all this has been really a treat for me to hear now that they are young adults and it’s something we’ve got to continue to keep the younger generation aware of like I said so you never forget. Again to hear their stories is remarkable"" Clemens said.

""It really is a powerful testament to the legacy of the people we lost that day"" Scott remarked.

The ""Fox Report"" host also noted that Clemens was originally supposed to pitch the night of September 11 2001 but since then he has worked to help organizations like Helping the Heroes Foundation. Clemens then recounted where he was during the moment of the attacks.

""Well I was supposed to pitch the night of 9/11 when everything happened. I was woken by a friend of mine at our building that’s not too far from the World Trade area and we went up to the top floor and saw what had happened. We thought it was a smaller plane or an accident and then obviously within 20 30 minutes we knew well it was a terrorist attack and we were being attacked. Our nation was being attacked and everything kind of changed from there"" Clemens said.

ICONIC 9/11 PHOTOS AND THE PHOTOGRAPHERS WHO SHOT THEM: HERE ARE THEIR STORIES

He then described the first game the Yankees played following 9/11 noting ""there wasn’t a dry eye in Chicago"" when they played. More importantly he was glad that they could ""take a lot of the fans’ minds off what was going on.""

""Mike Piazza hit an unbelievable home run and really was able to take a lot of the fans’ minds off what was going on and back to baseball a little bit. I got an opportunity to pitch again and got my 20th win at the time but there wasn’t a dry eye in Chicago"" Clemens said.

While Clemens remarked that returning to New York after the game was ""one of the hardest things"" he had to do he also recalled other moments such as watching the first pitch made by former President George W. Bush.

""When we came back to play the World Series game 3 in Yankees Stadium President Bush 43 came out to throw out the first pitch and I think everyone has seen the video of him with a bullet-proof vest on wind up and throw a perfect strike down Broadway. And the whole place lit up. I was in the bullpen with Mel Stottlemyre the pitching coach and I stopped warming up and asked Mel to turn around with me so we could watch"" Clemens described.

""We had the perfect seat"" he said. ""Fifty-five thousand people so it was great."""

So whether you already own one of Garmin’s many watches or are wanting to enter the brand’s wrist-based world for the first time does the Forerunner 945 warrant the mighty spend?

Some of the main improvements from the 945’s predecessor the Forerunner 935 include the very handy option to play music directly from the watch to your headphones via Bluetooth without your phone.

It also boasts a new optical heart-rate sensor along with a whole host of tracking and analysis upgrades to satisfy the most stats-obsessed cyclist.

The 945 will now adapt its feedback if you’re training in hot conditions or at altitude and the training analysis is incredibly detailed.

Straight after a workout you can see how your session benefitted you aerobically as well as anaerobically and the Training Effect feature tells you how the session will impact your endurance fitness (i.e. a long steady session will affect your aerobic capacity).

The Training Load feedback will require you to wear the watch almost constantly to get the most out of it yet the great thing about the 945 is that no matter how deep you go it’s still hugely simple and intuitive to operate.

If you just want to press go and get on your bike it’s as easy as pressing a button and waiting for the satellite to pick up and generally the four-button interface is very user-friendly.

The large screen is clear when on the move and the colours look especially vibrant when using the excellent mapping features while its whopping battery life of 36 hours in GPS mode is really impressive.

All the connectivity we’ve come to expect from the tech giant remains on the 945 including instant sharing to third-party apps and smart notifications.

New features include Garmin Pay for contactless payments and Incident Detection to notify chosen contacts when the watch detects a bike crash.

HR accuracy fared very well in comparison tests and I had no problems with GPS reliability.

Smartwatches for cyclists Are smartwatches truly essential for cyclists when an all-singing bike computer such as a Garmin Edge 1030 will give you all the two-wheeled features you’ll ever need… and probably some that you don’t? A smartwatch can do a lot though: provide 24/7 data; comprehensive cycling stats; sleep pattern recovery status and physical fitness analysis; and some can even tell you how well you’re acclimatising to altitude and give real-time advice on when to fuel your rides. Combined with data from any other sports you’ll have a holistic view of your training and can create training plans and analyse your routes/rides in detail. There is a lot to choose from though and some of these features you simply won’t need so beyond our test of six popular options make sure you do your own research too. We've also got a guide to choosing the best cycling watch with our top-rated options. Also on test Coros Pace 2

But hiring managers should consider that candidates with autism can respond differently to hiring decisions. “CIOs should be extra sensitive to the emotional impact a rejection can have. A well-defined feedback plan must be in place and followed. Communication should be in person or over video. Make the feedback clear and actionable highlighting areas of improvement for the unsuccessful candidate” Gartner’s diversity study says.

Neurodiversity extends beyond autism. Gartner points out that people with dyspraxia are often highly creative and strategic in their thinking as well as excellent communicators. People with ADHD have attributes such as hyper focus spontaneity and the ability to “jump right in” to problem-solving. They also score higher on creativity tests than people who do not have ADHD. According to Gartner 84% of people with dyslexia are above average in reasoning understanding patterns evaluating possibilities and making decisions. Dyslexia correlates with creativity problem solving storytelling and enhanced verbal communication skills.

Tips for IT leaders to improve diversity

The first lesson on diversity equity and inclusion is to accept that you cannot know everything. Seek knowledge and reach out to organisations that have succeed in achieving diversity in the workplace or those specialised in training in those areas.

Diversity is an outcome; it should not be a quota or a number. There is no point hiring a certain number of migrants or promoting a certain number of women to leadership roles if that is still viewed as a quota that has been filled. Inclusion is a cultural shift and the numbers will naturally follow. Everyone in the organisation is responsible but leaders should lead.

Diversity should not be a good-to-have but a must-have. When organisations focus on what they look like externally rather than how they are perceived internally by their workers those organisations fail to build a truly diverse workforce.

One of the main issues is the unconscious bias where people tend to get close to those they have something in common with. That often happens naturally and isn’t a conscious decision. It may be native English speakers keeping a closer relationship with each other it may be migrants keeping a closer relationship with each other. Education around diversity equity and inclusion can help everyone see how unconscious bias leads to exclusion and how to act instead in inclusive ways.

Ironically good intentions can lead to exclusion. “Affinity groups [employee resource groups or ERGs] are the main way that most companies think of first [to promote diversity]. Indeed having an in-house affinity group gives individuals an instant network and like-minded friends” Gartner’s study says. “However affinity groups are by definition exclusive.”

Think of ERGs as one of several efforts needed to change the business culture. “Mentorship allyship and sponsorship programs are a way to maintain diversity while still belonging. Diversity without inclusion can actually be counterproductive” Gartner recommends.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vZWRtLmNvbS9tdXNpYy1yZWxlYXNlcy9uby1tYW5hLWVsZWN0cm9tYWctY29tcGlsYXRpb27SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"No Mana Ushers In the Return of Electro House With ""Electromag"" Compilation",ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://edm.com/music-releases/no-mana-electromag-compilation on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vZWRtLmNvbS9tdXNpYy1yZWxlYXNlcy9uby1tYW5hLWVsZWN0cm9tYWctY29tcGlsYXRpb27SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcm9saW5hY29hc3RvbmxpbmUuY29tL25ld3NfdGltZXMvc3BvcnRzL2FydGljbGVfMjU1MWJlYTAtMTMwYi0xMWVjLWE1YzQtZDc5NjU0NGQ3Zjk2Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cougars serve up first volleyball victory over Patriots since 2018,"State Alabama Alaska Arizona Arkansas California Colorado Connecticut Delaware Florida Georgia Hawaii Idaho Illinois Indiana Iowa Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Maine Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Mississippi Missouri Montana Nebraska Nevada New Hampshire New Jersey New Mexico New York North Carolina North Dakota Ohio Oklahoma Oregon Pennsylvania Rhode Island South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Texas Utah Vermont Virginia Washington Washington D.C.

However according to media reports a grey market has been expanding in recent years and it has been quite common for customers to buy Xiaomi devices in one region and use them in another.Some media have attributed Xiaomi's recent move to lock its handsets to the US' ""long-arm jurisdiction"" speculating that Washington is exerting pressure on the Chinese company to block phones used in those sanctioned countries and regions.In response Xiaomi said that it ""temporarily"" locked some smartphones to prevent and investigate potential smuggling that hurt users' information security and consumers' rights. ""The investigation has achieved significant results and the affected devices can be unlocked now"" Xiaomi's spokesperson said.In the Q2 of 2021 shipment of Xiaomi smartphones ranked second in the global market for the first time buoyed by a rapid growth in overseas markets according to a report issued by Gartner.Xiaomi also accounts for about 15 percent of the market share in Cuba according to data by research firm Statcounter.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuYWx5dGljc2luc2lnaHQubmV0L2xhdGVzdC1uZXdzL3NkZy1ncm91cC1hY2NlbGVyYXRpbmctYnVzaW5lc3MtdmFsdWUtd2l0aC1jbG91ZC1haS1wb3dlcmVkLWRhdGEtYW5hbHl0aWNz0gGBAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuYWx5dGljc2luc2lnaHQubmV0L2FtcC9zdG9yeS9sYXRlc3QtbmV3cy9zZGctZ3JvdXAtYWNjZWxlcmF0aW5nLWJ1c2luZXNzLXZhbHVlLXdpdGgtY2xvdWQtYWktcG93ZXJlZC1kYXRhLWFuYWx5dGljcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SDG Group: Accelerating Business Value with Cloud & AI-Powered Data & Analytics,Client satisfaction is not enough for SDG Group.

Share this story

DE&S has negotiated a contract for Boeing Defence UK to fit Infra-Red Suppression Systems (IRSS) onto the fleet’s Mk5 and Mk6 aircraft. IRSS uses blanking plates to mask hot components and redirects airflow to cool exhaust gases both of which reduce the infra-red signature hostile forces might rely on when firing missiles.

Jeremy Quin Minister for Defence Procurement said: “The threat posed to UK military aircraft by Man Portable Air Defence Systems and other surface-to-air missile systems has increased in sophistication and spread widely across unstable regions. “IRSS is required to keep pace with threat advancement and enable continued deployment of Chinook in congested degraded and operationally limited environments while offering optimal protection from the threat to the aircraft onboard troops and crew.”

BDUK has signed a £63.7-million contract for the design integration and modification of IRSS up to 2026. The agreement is expected to create or sustain up to 100 jobs across their UK sites contributing to the estimated total of 450 people employed in Chinook support across the supply chain. Chinook is the UK Armed Forces’ only heavy-lift helicopter and can transport up to 55 troops or more than ten tonnes of supplies. Along with Puma Wildcat and Merlin it was part of the Joint Helicopter Aviation Task Force which transported NHS paramedics equipment and patients at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. It came to the rescue when the Whaley Bridge dam in Derbyshire burst in 2019 and since 2018 has been deployed to Mali to help French counter-terrorism forces.

DE&S Director Helicopters Keith Bethell said: “Our Chinook contracts with BDUK are a prime example of how we work closely and effectively with industry to keep one of the UK’s most important military assets in the best possible condition for operations around the globe. “IRSS is the latest in a long line of upgrades we are delivering for the Chinook fleet. Not only will it add a significant defensive capability to the aircraft but the enabling contract will support jobs in the supply chain until 2026.”",,,,,,,,,

Jack Keane describes being inside the Pentagon on 9/11: 'I knew it was a terrorist attack',"Ret. Army Gen. Jack Keane on Friday described his experience inside the Pentagon on the morning of Sept. 11 2001 as the U.S. approaches 20 years since the attack.

The retired four-star general and chairman of the Institute for the Study of War was working as the Army's vice chief of staff under President Bush at the time and was in a meeting when he heard news that two planes had crashed into both towers at the World Trade Center.

""I knew it was a terrorist attack"" Keane told Fox News. ""…I was getting a report from the chief of my operations center — a two-star general — and we were talking about an airplane that had come up I-95 and had come close to Washington D.C.and then back to the east and went south. We err discussing what if any evacuation procedures there were for buildings in D.C. when the plane hit and rocked the Pentagon.""

As Keane and the chief of the operations center discussed why the plane turned away and the procedure for evacuating buildings in Washington D.C. a plane hit the Pentagon and smoke filled parts of the building ""almost immediately."" He then told the two-star general ""to get the word to the Army writ large that the Army operation center was operational despite the attack and that we would maintain that command and control of the Army around the world here.""

Keane and his aide then wet some T-shirts in an office bathroom to prevent smoke inhalation and went to ""assist people to get out of the building.""

The former Army chief of staff said he lost 85 Army ""teammates"" that day. In total 189 people died as a result of the attack on the Pentagon. Nearly 2800 others were killed in the initial attacks on the World Trade Center.

""We knew we were at war"" Keane said. ""The first battle of that war took place in the Pentagon and the World Trade Center. I visited the hospital that night five different hospitals. We had lots of wounded. Some of them stayed for weeks. I realized that there was a significant amount of heroism that had taken place from the patients in the hospital as well as from my officers and CEOs and civilians who joined me in the operation center who had been assisting people outside.""

He added that officials at the Pentagon ""knew everything had changed that day"" and that the United States was ""going to be at war with radical Islam.""

""We knew it had to be Usama bin Laden and we took steps that night before we went home about 1:00 or 2:00 in the morning to our support to Central Command which would be given the authority to conduct what we knew would be a war in Afghanistan against al Qaeda.""

Keane commanded the U.S. on keeping al Qaeda from attacking on American soil again boosting its defenses and ensuring that Afghanistan did not become a ""safe haven"" for terrorists for years. He does fear however that the risk in Afghanistan has ""gone up"" since the Biden administration ordered a complete withdrawal of the military before Aug. 31.

The challenge now the retired general said is whether U.S. officials will be able to ""keep watch on the development of these radical Islamist groups inside of Afghanistan and also impact them so that they don't grow to a status where they could attack us again.""

""My reflections today are about the victims that we lost"" Keane said. ""We honor them and we also honor the 9/11 generation who stood up and wanted to go out to protect America and protect America they did. They joined the military they joined the intelligence services and we're indebted to them because we've never had another attack on foreign soil again which was the mission.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3M0amF4LmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvMDkvMTIvd2FzLTkxMS15b3VyLWdlbmVyYXRpb24tZGVmaW5pbmctZXZlbnQtb3ItaXMtaXQtdGhlLXBhbmRlbWljLXdlcmUtbGl2aW5nLXRocm91Z2gv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Was 9/11 your generation-defining event?

JACKSONVILLE Fla. – Depending on your age you get a different question about recent historical events.

For the Greatest Generation it was about your connection to Pearl Harbor and World War II.

Recommended Videos

Baby Boomers are asked where they were when they heard that President John Kennedy was assassinated. Or Dr. King.

The defining question for Generation X – generally defined as being born between 1965 and 1980 – is about their memories of Sept. 11 2001.

Some Millennials – born in the 80s and 90s – will remember the terrorist attacks and certainly the aftermath: the war in Afghanistan and the killing of Osama bin Laden. For those in high school and college at the time 9/11 was used for lessons of current events or recent history. Many from this generation joined the military and deployed as part of the war or terror. Some didn’t make it back home or are still carrying the trauma in their bodies and minds.

My daughter is among the youngest of Generation Z – born in the late 90s through early 2000s. She remembers seeing pictures of burning buildings on TV. We quickly realized we shouldn’t watch the coverage with her in the room.

But how could you not watch? We were witnessing history.

The latest generation grew up in a post 9/11 world: at first a unified (at least if you weren’t Muslim) patriotic United States. Fear of another attack leads to wide acceptance of a new layer of security in travel and at public events. For anyone under age 25 it’s all they’ve ever known.

But a few years later the housing bubble burst and the country was plunged into recession. People began to retreat to their ideological corners -- perhaps further apart than ever.

Another radical divide came with the revolution in technology. Millennials and beyond grew up with computers but 9/11 was still primarily a televised event. Smartphones and instant connection and communications wherever/whenever wouldn’t happen for a few years.

Entering the 2000s social media instant messaging and a proliferation of online news sources became the norm. Would the country the world ever experience a communal event again?

Yes but not in the same way.

Early last year coronavirus changed everything. It actually touched more people than any of those previous generation-defining events. While only 12% of Americans actually caught COVID-19 – so far -- life as we know it was turned upside down for almost everyone.

For most of the youngest among us going into lockdown means isolation from friends and setbacks in both emotional and academic development. For those a little older graduations were either canceled or virtual and the prospects of getting a job plummeted.

Research done early in the pandemic shows those between ages 18 and 23 were hit the hardest.

A March 2020 Pew Research survey found that “half of older Gen Zers reported that they or someone in their household had lost a job or taken a cut in pay because of the outbreak significantly higher than the shares of Millennials (40%) Gen Xers (36%) and Baby Boomers (25%) who said the same.”

And this generation’s defining moment wasn’t a moment. We’re still living with it 18 months later. While it appears we may be cresting our third (some say our fourth) surge in COVID-19 cases hospitalizations and deaths medical experts are concerned the mu variant or something we haven’t even heard of yet could create another spike in the fall or winter.

The polarization of political rhetoric and splintered media giving sometimes wildly different information all presented as the truth is slowing our nation’s recovery. The fact that only 64% of adults in the United States are fully vaccinated nearly six months after the free shots became available to everyone speaks volumes about our lack of unity.

It’s way too early to know the long-term impact of the pandemic on Gen Z and the rest of us. A decade or two after this pandemic is under control others will analyze what we’ve learned. Hopefully both our children and our country will be healthy and work together on the challenges of their generation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnd1d20uY29tLzIwMjEtMDktMTIvMjAyMi1nZW5lc2lzLWc3MC0zLTN0LXNwb3J0LWFkdmFuY2VkLXJldmlld9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2022 Genesis G70 3.3T Sport Advanced Review,"In the 1980s and 1990s there were a few grunty sport sedans that wouldn’t send a buyer to Uncle Guido for a small loan. Today a loan is a near certainly but if someone wants to save some on their monthly payments Genesis has a sport sedan worth a look. It’s called the G70 and rides on a platform equivalent in size to a Toyota Camry.

The G70 is a good sized car but not a luxury limo with monster power and a price tag to match. Nope the G70 is extremely fast and handles like a similar sized BMW. It’s fun on the road and faster than nearly anything not costing way north of $50 grand.

However the G70 isn’t cheap. It starts at a modest $38550 for a base rear-drive 252-horsepower turbo I4 version and tops out at $51445 for the Prestige model with its crazy fast 3.3-liter twin-turbo V6 cranking 365 horses.

The Himalayan Gray test car started at $45245 that sparkly gray color adding $500 and features the twin-turbo V6. It’s what you’d want if you long for a performance car that looks sharp but feels luxurious. This was the G70 AWD 3.3T Sport Advanced model including a $4300 Sport Advanced package.

I’d tested the more luxurious G80 sedan a couple months back and it’s the luxury liner limo with a performance edge especially with its horsier V6. The G70 is a family sport sedan a smaller firmer riding rocket ship.

Blasting off on a highway entry ramp it’s easy to eclipse triple digits which is why Car and Driver magazine puts its top speed at 167 mph. Yeow! That speed is achieved via AWD here. It favors the rear wheels unless the pavement is slick. Shifts via the 8-speed automatic are crisp and the G70’s 365 horsepower pushes you back into its leather seats just like an old-time V8.

Of course there are drive modes (5 here) to accomplish that oomph. Both Sport and Sport+ will get your juices flowing while also firming the steering effort but never to the point of being a burden to the driver. Steering is precise and makes the G70 an apex eater. Fun!

The down side is a stiff ride yet not punishing. Still that could be helped with softer seats — the G70s are a bit too hard in the butt pocket for a 60-something like me. I also noticed a bit more road/tire noise from the rear vs. the longer G80.

Braking is solid as you’d expect but at slower speeds I found the brakes a bit grabby. Don’t forget this has AWD too an aid to traction in winter slop. I’d want that even though it adds $2000 to any G70.

Mark Savage The interior of this Genesis G70 had gray perforated leather seats and lower door trim a black dash and upper door trim giving it a modern two-tone appearance.

Inside the test car looked great with gray perforated leather seats and lower door trim a black dash and upper door trim giving this a modern two-tone appearance. Genesis uses patterned aluminum inserts in the doors and by the console-mounted shifter. Other trim is satin chrome for a classy look.

Overhead is a panoramic sunroof and shade while under the center stack is a wireless phone charger.

The Genesis info screen is 10.25 inches and easy to see and use. The digital instrument cluster also is attractive and I like the big climate control knobs on the center stack below the info screen. They can be synched or run separately to chill or warm your fellow passenger.

Down below are metal-faced pedals and the power seats are simple to use both front seats being 12-way adjustable. The leather seats feel fine to the touch but my wife and I found the seat pockets too firm which became tiring on a roundtrip to Chicago. However the seats are heated and cooled which is a nice thing during weather extremes. A heated steering wheel is standard while those cooled seats are part of the pricy Sport Advanced package.

Mark Savage The Genesis info screen is 10.25 inches and easy to see and use. The digital instrument cluster also is attractive with big climate control knobs on the center stack below the info screen. Overhead is a panoramic sunroof and shade and there's a wireless phone charger under the center stack.

The G70 also adds the sunroof and a cushion extender for long-legged drivers and tightening side bolsters which are engaged in Sport and Sport+ modes. I liked that but just wish the bottom cushions were softer.

Other add-ons in that package include parking sensors snazzy dark alloy wheels that aluminum interior trim a dark chrome diamond-patterned grille and a fine Lexicon 15-speaker premium sound system. A visceral aid is the variable exhaust valve system that makes that twin-turbo V6 sound special in Sport and Sport+ modes.

For the techy among us a digital key system is part of the package that allows you to use your cell phone as the car key. Great unless you misplace your phone or leave it in someone else’s car.

Trunk space is less than many in this segment at just 11 cubic feet. A couple sets of golf clubs will likely fit though.

Safety equipment is as you’d expect with all but the parking sensor system standard.

Mark Savage The Genesis G70 is a sport sedan that rides on a platform equivalent in size to a Toyota Camry.

Genesis packs in a lot including its semi-autonomous driving system that keeps the car between a highway’s center and side lines. It works well and directs the car through high-speed turns too although it sometimes warns you to put your hands on the wheel even though they already are. It wants you to keep them at the 10 and 2 positions. I also noticed on a long stretch of straight highway that the car sort of ping-ponged between the freeway lines which felt a bit odd. I suggest holding the wheel as steady as you can to avoid that sensation.

On the plus side is the Genesis/Hyundai 10-year or 100000-mile powertrain warranty plus three years or 36000-mile free maintenance (so oil changes and the like). There’s also a free towing service connected Genesis devices services and map upgrades for that same period.

One minor annoyance or oddity is Genesis Hyundai and Kia’s insistence on playing a little tune electronically each time the car is turned off and a door opened. I started laughing about it each time after a few days. Really reminds of a washer and/or dryer playing a tune when the load is finished.

Pricing and mpg? The test car with its turbo V6 is rated 17 mpg city and 25 mpg highway by the EPA. I got 20 mpg in a mix that was heavier on city driving and 25.4 in a mix heavy on highway driving. The trip computer was pretty close on its estimates and on one highway stint registered 31 mpg. Nice!

Pricing for this model is $45245 with delivery and $50045 with the big package and sparkly gray paint job. A Sport model with the horsey V6 lists at $42100 with RWD and add $2 grand for AWD. All V6 models add larger brakes a sport-tuned suspension dual exhausts and variable ratio steering. Those prices are below the likes of Audi BMW and Mercedes-Benz competitors.

Note too that visually the G70 upgraded a couple areas for 2022 with a diamond-patterned grille refreshed look for the head and taillights a trunk spoiler lip and a lowered rear license plate to clean up the tail. It creates a sharp package that looks ritzier than its price.

Final word: If looks performance and practical pluses mean more to you than badge envy the Genesis G70 is a top compact sport luxury sedan choice.

Mark Savage The G70 starts at a modest $38550 for a base rear-drive 252-horsepower turbo I4 version and tops out at $51445 for the Prestige model with its crazy fast 3.3-liter twin-turbo V6 cranking 365 horses.

Does Tiny Tina’s Wonderland Have a Free Upgrade Option?

Sadly no there will not be any free upgrade path for Tiny Tina’s Wonderland for owners of either the PS4 or Xbox One version to the next-gen versions (PS5 Xbox Series X|S). This was confirmed in the official FAQ. Instead owners will need to pay a fee if they want to play an experience optimized for next-gen consoles.

For physical buyers of the Standard edition there is a bit more to it than just paying the fee however as PS4 owners will be required to have the disc inserted in order to play the downloaded PS5 version. This is similar to other physical game upgrades that offer digital upgrades on the platform.

Xbox One owners who plan on buying the Standard physical version of Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands are unfortunately locked out of the next-gen upgrade meaning if you want to play the game with all the benefits offered from the Xbox Series you will need to either purchase the Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands: Next-Level Edition or the Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands: Chaotic Great Edition to get the Series X|S versions included. If you opt for the standard physical you will need to buy the entire game again as noted due to no available upgrade path.

If you do however play the Xbox One version on the Xbox Series it will use the preset options of the Xbox One X so there will be some improvements however it won’t be exactly the same as the Series X|S versions.

If you plan on going the digital route there is still a fee to upgrade to the next-gen version if you get the standard edition.

As for your game saves you will be able to continue where you left off as long as you within platform family. Xbox one owners can use their game saves on the Xbox Series and PS4 owners on the PS5 via save transferring.

The FAQ notes specifically for PS4 to PS5 that PS5 saves are non transferable to PS4.

For a myriad of reasons Summerfest 2021 had felt unusual to say the least heading into Friday night. That changed however with a packed house at the Generac Power Stage chanting for rapper G-Eazy and dancing along to the sounds of Milwaukee’s DJ Devest8 in the buildup to the headlining set. Once he emerged from the pre-show darkness into the spotlight there was the ever-familiar roar that reminded you that live music is back in full force and G-Eazy was ready to make the most of it.

In the course of about an hour there was very little stoppage as the Bay Area rapper rattled off a slew of tracks to get the crowd going. While initially positioned at a central mic stand to speak his peace he quickly abandoned it within the course of two songs in order to pace the stage with a calm confident demeanor. Rather than showing the concert on the screens at the renovated stage visuals of California flashed on either side of the rapper. All eyes were on the stage and deservingly so.

2017 hit “Boss Tycoon” was the first song to elicit a big response from the Summerfest crowd and an early appearance by featured rapper Kossisko who is signed under G-Eazy. The set later included a small medley to showcase Kossisko’s work as well including collaboration “Running Wild (Tumblr Girls 2)” marking one of the rare times that things slowed down. It would pick back up quickly with cuts from his The Beautiful & Damned project that had fans remembering how to bounce and balance on Summerfest bleachers.

G-Eazy and his crew certainly knew how to get a crowd to react and that was on full display Friday with the show’s fair share of cheap pops. The rapper managed to substitute “Wisconsin” into his bars regularly and countdowns with EDM-style steam cannons were commonplace. At one point a rapid-fire barrage of featured verses made it into the set with Post Malone track “Same Bitches” garnering a big reaction as well as a verse over the beat to current pop mega-hit “Astronaut In The Ocean” by Masked Wolf. While pacing the stage G-Eazy made a habit of grabbing fans phones recording a short video of himself rapping to the crowd and tossing the phones back. Every time it happened the crowd ate it up. It felt like there was no extra effort that needed to be emitted from the stage to keep the fans going.

Towards the latter half of the show the most well-known material came out naturally. G-Eazy did manage to bring some new music to Milwaukee however with the recent announcement of a new album later this month. He performed a new single “Fathful” which was so fresh that he admitted he was still learning his lyrics on the song. Before closing out the night he also sprinkled in a new collaboration with Demi Lovato with the screens showing mock headlines of Lovato’s recent drug addiction-related issues. It was somewhat of an unusual move but again most of the eyeballs were directed center-stage. The promotion for the album wasn’t done however as he instructed the crowd to chant “September 24” the release date for the new project.

Two big hits with major fanfare closed out the night. “No Limit” featuring A$AP Rocky and Cardi B got the biggest reaction of the night with a microphone being directed down to a female fan to rap Cardi’s explicit guest feature. She may have been starstruck. “Still Be Friends” a collaboration with since-cancelled artist Tory Lanez and Tyga was the closer complete with the full singalong treatment. Timing out at right around the hour mark the night was wrapped with no encore.

As G-Eazy was quick to point out the night was a celebration of being able to enjoy music with one another again as has been a central theme of many Summerfest sets this year. He certainly brought the party and before you knew it it was time to go home. Sometimes the best parties go that way.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRtajQuY29tL25ld3Mvc3VtbWVyZmVzdC9ndWl0YXJzLWZvci12ZXRzLWEta2Vub3NoYS1ub25wcm9maXQtcm9ja3MtdGhlLXN1bW1lcmZlc3Qtc3RhZ2XSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Guitars for Vets a Kenosha nonprofit rocks the Summerfest stage,"MILWAUKEE — On Military appreciation day at Summerfest some Veterans got on the Generac Stage to play a two hour set.

The performers were all part of the nonprofit Guitars for Vets. It's a Kenosha based organization that gives veterans free guitars and lessons as a form of therapy.

""The guitar resonates in the center of your being and it's very soothing"" Patrick Nettesheim the co-founder of Guitars for Vets said.

Nettesheim isn't a veteran but believes that giving veterans this form of therapy is important to creating ""world peace.""

“And we’re going to give them a voice. A voice that doesn’t have to be spoken. One that can be created through that of the guitar.”

So far 6000 veterans have gone through the program. Some of them were playing alongside Nettesheim during this two hour Summerfest set.

“You see a lot of terrible things and terrible nightmares so you try to put it away"" Pet Ruzicka the President of Guitars for Vets said.

Ruzicka played on stage and said it was a wonderful experience. He spent 24 years in the military working in Grenada to Germany to Iraq. For him and many others this program has helped him cope and talk about his experiences.

“And then you start the camaraderie you develop with others. They are trying to either learn or doing the same thing"" Ruzicka said.

To be able to perform at Summerfest was just the icing on the cake. Guitars for Vets currently has around 5000 applicants waiting for a guitar and lesson. Patrick Nettesheim hopes performances like these can help raise awareness and give more veterans the therapy tools they need.

Guitars for Vets takes both financial donations and guitar donations. So if you have a guitar laying around the house that isn't being played and want to donate it go to their website to learn more.

Here’s where,"While Washington bickers about what if anything has been achieved after 20 years and nearly $5tn spent on “forever wars” there is one clear winner: the US defense industry.

In Iraq and Afghanistan the American military relied to an unprecedented degree on private contractors for support in virtually all areas of war operations. Contractors supplied trucks planes fuel helicopters ships drones weapons and munitions as well as support services from catering and construction to IT and logistics. The number of contractors on the ground outnumbered US troops most years of the conflicts. By the summer of 2020 the US had 22562 contractor personnel in Afghanistan – roughly twice the number of American troops.

The gravy train for the defense industry was also fueled by the way the wars were budgeted and paid for. Congress used “emergency” and “contingency” funding that circumvented the normal budget process. For the first decade of the conflict the US used emergency appropriations which are typically reserved for one-off crises such as floods and hurricanes. Detailed spending oversight was minimal. And because this type of spending is excluded from budget projections and deficit estimates it enabled everyone to sustain the pretense that the wars would be over shortly.

The result was what former defense secretary Robert Gates termed a “culture of endless money” inside the Pentagon. The defense department made the operational decisions; managed the bidding process for contractors; awarded the contracts (largely using non-competitive bids); and kept at least 10% of the wartime funding in classified accounts.

Not even the financial crisis of 2008 could interrupt the spending spree. While Congress imposed across-the-board spending caps on government programs war spending was specifically excluded. The Pentagon was able to use the special “contingency” war budget to buy upgrades services and new equipment that were barely related to Iraq or Afghanistan. Consequently the Pentagon budget kept growing – and was able to double its size between 2001 and 2020.

Defense stocks outperformed the stock market overall by nearly 60% during the Afghanistan war as the war spending surge enabled a wave of consolidation in the industry. The big five – Lockheed Martin Boeing General Dynamics Raytheon and Northrop Grumman – and a handful of others acquired the next tier of manufacturers such as Hughes Aircraft and McDonnell Douglas.

In the year to June 2020 the big five accounted for nearly a third of the $480bn obligated by the Pentagon to defense contractors. While only a fraction of these sales went specifically for Iraq and Afghanistan the conflict was highly lucrative for all the major defense contractors. For example Lockheed Martin manufactured the Black Hawk helicopters used extensively in Afghanistan; Boeing sold the aircraft and land combat vehicles; Raytheon won the major contract training the Afghan air force; and Northrup Grumman and General Dynamics supplied electronic and communications equipment. Thousands of subcontractors around the world earned money from selling night-vision goggles engines sandbags communications equipment and all manner of stuff to the war effort. And global oil companies were key war beneficiaries since the Pentagon is the world’s single largest purchaser of fuel.

Meanwhile the defense sector spent over $2.4bn lobbying Congress since 2001 and made direct campaign contributions to most members.

The US presence on the ground may now be over. But America will still have to digest the huge price tag

Not surprisingly much of the wartime expenditures were highly wasteful. The Inspectors Generals for Afghanistan and Iraq the Wartime Contracting Commission and the Pentagon’s own inspector general all documented waste profiteering corruption and “ghost spending” (money spent on activities that turned out not to exist at all).

According to government analysts the net result of the large-scale private sector involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan was to increase materially the cost of war operations. Much of the $145bn reconstruction money was spent on questionable projects with budgets that seemed excessive or simply could not be accounted for. Many such projects now destroyed and dilapidated have littered the front pages over the past week.

The US presence on the ground may now be over. But America will still have to digest the huge price tag. The wars were paid for entirely with borrowed money rather than raising taxes – a first in US military history – and the US still owes $2tn in future veterans’ benefits. This financial hangover will be compounded by the need to replace what has been destroyed or simply left behind and to pay for the weapons and equipment purchased during the last 20 years of go-go defense spending. The legacy of the post-9/11 defense spending binge will continue to gobble up the US budget for years to come.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL2FybXlyZWNvZ25pdGlvbi5jb20vbmV3cy9hcm15LW5ld3MvMjAyMS9sZW9uYXJkby1kcnMtdG8tZGVsaXZlci1hZGRpdGlvbmFsLXNob3J0LXJhbmdlLWFpci1kZWZlbnNlLW1pc3Npb24tZXF1aXBtZW50LXBhY2thZ2Vz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Leonardo DRS to deliver additional short-range air defense mission equipment packages,"According to information released on September 9 2021 Leonardo DRS Inc. announced that it has been awarded a contract by General Dynamics to provide additional Mission Equipment Packages (MEP) for Maneuver Short Range Air Defense (M-SHORAD) Increment 1 (M-SHORAD Inc. 1) systems.

Now your pet's food bowl is the next place you might find plant-based products.

Pet ownership and spending has boomed in the U.S. amid the pandemic. Seventy percent of Americans or roughly 90.5 million homes now own a pet according to the American Pet Products Association. That represents an all-time high and is up from 67% of households in 2020.

In 2020 $103.6 billion was spent in the U.S. on pet-related products and services a 6.5% year-over-year increase according to the APPA.

The biggest portion of that expenditure is on pet food and treats which totaled $42 billion up 9.7% year-over-year. Not only was that increase driven by new pet owners but also by people just spending more on their pets — 30% of pet owners said they spent more on their pet in 2020 than the previous year while only 10% said they spent less according to the APPA.

With more consumers choosing to eat plant-based products for environmental and health reasons — sales of those products are expected to achieve a 30% compound annual growth rate through 2025 according to a UBS report — the expectation is that they could make similar decisions for their pet's food.

""A lot of people are like 'Your customers are plant-based vegans and vegetarians' and actually they're not"" said Ryan Bethencourt CEO of Wild Earth an alternative protein pet food company.

Where did Ashton Kutcher go to college?

After graduating from Clear Creek–Amana High School Kutcher enrolled at the University of Iowa in August 1996.

Kutcher's planned major was biochemical engineering motivated to cure his brother's heart ailment.

Kutcher worked as a college summer hire in the cereal department for the General Mills plant in Cedar Rapids and sometimes sold his blood plasma to earn tuition money.

While at the University of Iowa he was approached by a model scout at The Airliner Bar in Iowa City Iowa.

Kutcher embarked on his modeling career and never looked back.

Although he initially continued his studies at the University of Iowa he eventually dropped out of college and moved to California where he began his acting career.

Why is Ashton Kutcher trending?

Iowa State University fans weren't thrilled that Kutcher was named the guest picker for ESPN's College GameDay.

Kutcher didn't exactly get a warm welcome from Iowa State fans as they yelled ""take a shower"" at him.

The famous actor and his wife Kunis previously admitted they ""only bathe"" their kids ""when they can see dirt on them.""

During an interview with Ashton on GameDay before the Iowa State Cyclones versus the Iowa Hawkeyes matchup the movie star's words got interrupted when fans began to scream ""take a shower.""

However Ashton carried on as he began talking about his project Outside Wine.

Some College GameDay viewers quickly took to Twitter where they continued to drag Kutcher.

He wants General Motors to buy it back. So do Bolt owners Wendy Fong Stan Goldberg and Durham Smith. They find it unsettling to own a vehicle even GM has warned could catch on fire.

“It’s unnerving at the very least"" said Smith of Lake Wylie South Carolina. He owns a 2022 Chevy Bolt EUV. ""How can we possibly put a car in our garage that might catch on fire? I don’t feel secure parking a car outside given our tree coverage.”

Last month GM expanded its second recall on Bolts to include all model years through 2022 — that means Smith's Bolt too which he'd bought just 15 days earlier. The recall which affects about 141000 vehicles globally is due to battery defects that could start a fire. There have been a dozen Bolts that have caught fire while parked although GM has not confirmed that each of those fires was caused by defective batteries.

GM has apologized to its Bolt owners for the inconvenience saying it and its battery maker LG Chem have ""hundreds of people"" working around the clock to find the cause of the problem and correct it to ensure defect-free products will be made going forward.

As of Friday GM spokesman Kevin Kelly said the automaker is ""still working with LG on manufacturing process updates.""

GM has said that when it is confident that LG Chem can produce defect-free battery modules GM will notify Bolt owners in writing and repairs will begin. Once a repair is made GM will provide an eight-year/100000 mile warranty on it. In the meantime GM has assured Bolt owners that if they follow three steps the cars should be safe:

Keep the car charged to only 90%.

Avoid depleting the battery below a range of at least 70 miles.

Do not park the car in a garage or charge it overnight.

""We understand the frustration Bolt EV owners are experiencing and are working as quickly as we can to make sure LG has instituted updated manufacturing processes based on both of our teams working together on the issues"" Kelly said.

'Minor problem minor risk'

Some Bolt owners take the recall in stride.

“There’s over 80000 Bolts made and just over a dozen fires. There’s hundreds more who have been in (unrelated) accidents"" said Douglas Shrock of Eureka California who owns a 2021 Bolt. ""You’re more likely to get in an accident. That’s my risk assessment. Nothing changed for me.""

Shrock even used an inverter on his Bolt last year to power his house during an electrical outage. Kelly said GM does not encourage that because the Bolt was not designed to do that. Still Shrock is a fan of the vehicle.

""The problem is a minor problem. In life it’s an incredibly minor risk"" Shrock said. ""So if I don’t get a new battery for three years that’s an 11-year warranty for me when I do get it. I am very happy with the car.""

But for others the safety steps are only doable for so long and the risk is too great.

“How is that realistic? If it’s your only vehicle how are people getting by?"" said Nathan Gardner the Bolt owner who lives in Sonora California. ""There are people like myself in fire-prone areas putting their families and homes at risk because there’s nowhere to charge and you can’t stay up all night to watch it charge. I am not sure why these cars are even on the road?”

'Can't sleep at night'

The public has taken notice of the recall too with some parking garages forbidding Bolts an entrance.

On the Chevy Bolt EV and EUV Owners Group on Facebook a Bolt owner posted a photo of a sign on his office parking garage in Seattle Washington that read: ""Chevrolet Bolt EVs are strictly prohibited from entering this facility in conjunction with the recent recall due to fire-related safety concerns.""

The person who posted the photo expressed frustration that there is no fix yet noting he had to street park nearly 2 miles away. He spoke to the Free Press but asked that his name not be published because he just started the buyback process with GM for his 2021 Bolt and he does not want to derail it.

But when asked about his reaction to the recall he said: ""I feel very lied to. I specifically bought the 2021 over a used 2016 because I was told it wasn’t a risk the problem had been taken care of.""

Meanwhile Gardner 46 has owned his 2019 Bolt since October 2018 when he bought it new for $42000. He has enjoyed it even after GM issued the first recall last November on 2017-19 model year Bolts for potential fire risk. He said he followed GM's safety protocols then and got GM's repair done on it in May. He was assured by his dealer that it all looked good he said.

But in June Gardner and his family returned home from a camping trip plugged the vehicle in to charge it in the garage and within a short time smelled intense heat. Gardner who works as a park ranger and firefighter said the garage was at least 90 degrees inside.

“I felt along the rims and bottoms of the car"" Gardner said. ""The inside wasn’t hot but the lower areas near the battery were really hot. I would chalk that up to a close call.""

It was the first time he ever had a problem with the car but it would be the last he said. By mid-June he was pushing GM to buy back his Bolt.

""If my property caught on fire we could be the reason that all of Sonora burns off the map"" said Gardner who lives near many of the recent wildfires. ""I can’t sleep at night knowing the car outside our home could possibly catch on fire.""

In August GM sent Gardner a letter saying that it would buy back his Bolt but as of Wednesday Gardner said GM has not said how much it will give him for the car though his dealer told him to expect $23000 “which is insane. This is a car I would have otherwise kept for 10 or 15 years.""

Gardner still wants a buyback even if there is a fix but he said he'll remain open in the future.

""If the '22 model was clear I would have switched right over"" he said. ""However I'm going to wait and see what happens. I'm not interested in being a guinea pig on fire.""

No payment on it

GM's Kelly said GM is buying back vehicles on a case-by-case basis but he declined to reveal the criteria used to determine whether a person gets a buyback and the buyback amount.

Smith 74 is determined to get a buyback. He said he refuses to pay on the vehicle he is considering contacting a lawyer and he might run a full-page ad in his local newspaper telling his story.

On Aug. 5 Smith and his wife Cyndie bought a 2022 Bolt EUV — the all-new compact electric SUV — for about $40000. The couple wanted to be environmentally conscious plus it was fun to drive and ""I loved the car it was just wonderful"" Cyndie said.

But on Aug. 20 their new vehicle was part of GM's recall. Four days later Smith returned the vehicle to the dealership hoping to exchange it for a Buick Envision SUV he said. But the dealership offered them $29900 for it and the Envision was $39900 Smith said.

Frustrated Smith decided rather than park the Bolt on his tree-lined driveway or in his garage he left the Bolt with the keys in it at the dealership and called a taxi to take him home. His first payment for it is approaching and the car remains at the dealership.

""I am looking at a couple of options none of which are paying on it because I feel that would be to acquiesce and it'd be an admission of ownership"" Smith said. ""I see it as unethical on General Motors' part to leave the car on the market.""

Smith has submitted all required paperwork to the automaker seeking a buyback he said and now he waits for a response.

A lifelong GM customer Smith said if GM and LG figure out a fix he will still likely want a buyback because ""GM's actions thus far have done nothing to instill confidence in either their capacity to fix the problem nor in any veracity in a statement about having done so.""

'Expediently executed' or out

It's the waiting that has Wendy Fong worried and wanting her money back.

Fong bought her 2021 Bolt EUV on July 8 just a month before her vehicle would be part of the recall. She lives in a townhouse in Los Angeles so had there been a fire in her garage she said it would have affected her neighbors.

She likes the vehicle but she said she hates the uncertainty around the recall.

""I would like to have a timetable of ‘This is what’s going to happen as a customer and if you don’t like it we’ll buy it back or we’ll put you in a different car' "" Fong said. ""I don’t want to deal with this on a long-term basis and I don’t want a patch or temporary fix.”

Fong said if there is a fix that is reliable safe and ""expediently executed"" she would keep the vehicle. She admits ""expediently executed"" is subjective. For her it means a maximum of three months to get the repair done.

""Living with the existing restrictions per GM or for an indeterminable time would not be acceptable"" Fong said. ""For our car specifically the recall status as of Wednesday morning is still 'Incomplete. Remedy not yet available.' ""

In a bind

Stan Goldberg 78 accepts the fact that he will have to be patient.

GM rejected his ask for a buyback of his 2017 Bolt a vehicle he bought used two years ago he said. Goldberg who lives in San Francisco said GM did not provide a reason for the rejection. So he feels he is in a bind.

""What are you going to do? You can sell the car but once the recall is out you’re not supposed to sell the car and then you have the issue of what do you do in its place?"" Goldberg said. ""That’s a problem.""

Goldberg noted that a global shortage of semiconductor chips has made new-car inventory tight and prices sky-high for both new and used cars.

""If you want an EV the deliveries are out until springtime"" Goldberg said. ""So you don’t have an immediate avenue to solve the problem. You’re stuck with being patient.""

That comes with a price. Goldberg has been parking the Bolt on his driveway instead of in his garage due to the recall and a rodent climbed inside and chewed up his charger cord. That cost him $300 to replace.

Still Goldberg said he is prepared for it take six months before his Bolt will get new battery modules once there is a fix. But he said he'd like to see GM offer other incentives to owners such as putting them in an internal combustion engine car or offering incentives on the upcoming Cadillac Lyriq all-electric SUV due out later next year. GM declined to comment on GM's specific considerations with customers saying that happens on a case-by-case basis.

'Hang tight'

Lawyer Shalev Amar owner of Amar Law Group headquartered in Scottsdale Arizona specializes in lemon laws. He said most states' lemon laws say once there is a fix a car cannot be in the shop out of service for 30 days or longer. In this case there are other considerations.

""Maybe there are environmental factors such as they live in Arizona it’s a desert out here so that might make things more precarious"" to charge the Bolt Amar said. ""So even with the safety restrictions the vehicle can’t be driven at all for at least 30 days. In my mind that’s unreasonable. That’s the same as it being in the shop for 30 days under lemon laws.""

Amar said the restrictions on charge miles to drive and parking it outside implies that ""the use is so limited once it gets to 60 days without a fix that would be unreasonable"" in his view.

“The other part of the lemon law is substantial impairment in use and value"" Amar said. ""(Bolt owners) are not getting what they paid for. I don’t know how anyone can argue with a straight face that these restrictions are not substantial impairment in use and value.”

He said GM should provide Bolt owners with loaner vehicles. GM's Kelly said ""We will work with our dealers as well as rental car providers to provide loaner transportation.""

For its part GM has idled production of its new Bolts built at Orion Assembly in Orion Township from Aug. 23 to Sept. 27. So it is eager to find a fix as much as anyone its spokesman has said. But GM insists it will not restart production or do repairs until it has absolute confidence in LG making defect-free products.

""Once we’re confident we have the correct processes in place we will work as quickly and safely as we can to produce the battery modules that will be used as replacements as part of the recall"" Kelly said. ""This will require some ramp-up time but again we will work as quickly as possible.""

Amar said this is one of the more unusual recalls he's ever seen.

""They’ve done the recall but they’re delaying doing the repair until they have a proper fix — I’ve never heard of that — it’s very unique"" Amar said. ""Usually they do a recall and they have a fix or fix plan and are ordering parts and will do it. It’s 'This is a major recall and we have an issue but hang tight.’ Life doesn’t hang tight.""

Executives congratulate staffs for their efforts

New facility addresses various active safety system testing conditions

Buildings and test tracks will be remodeled by next year strengthening GM’s second largest product engineering center

Incheon - GM Technical Center Korea (GMTCK) held a ceremony on Sept. 10 for the completion of its active safety test road at the Cheong-na Proving Ground to strengthen its capability as GM’s engineering arm in Korea. GM leadership and employees including GMTCK President Roberto Rempel and Vice President Brian McMurray attended the event and congratulated staffs.

The new four-lane road has a length of 600 meters and a width of 60 meters. It can carry out validation of new vehicle evaluation systems such as Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB) Rear Cross Traffic Braking (RCTB) and Lane Keeping Assist (LKA) in alignment with the scenarios used in the New Car Assessment Program (NCAP).

""The active safety test road makes vehicle engineering at the Cheong-na Proving Ground one of the core engineering facilities of GM and GMTCK safer and more efficient” said Rempel. “By developing active safety technology for GM brands such as Chevrolet GMTCK will continue to play a pivotal role for the second largest product engineering center at GM.""

Starting with the completion of the active safety test road the Cheong-na Proving Ground will further enhance GMTCK's competitiveness by remodeling buildings and test tracks by the end of this year. The Cheong-na Proving Ground and its more than 3000 high-caliber engineers are supporting more than 20 programs globally under development. In addition to the Cheong-na Proving Ground GMTKC’s organizations and facilities for GM's cutting-edge global vehicle development include a design center a vehicle engineering center and a manufacturing engineering center.

The GMTCK Cheong-na Proving Ground was completed in September 2007 in the Incheon Free Economy Zone about 20 minutes (10 kilometers) from GM Korea's headquarters in Bupyeong Incheon. The facility which spans 508228 square meters has various engineering facilities such as a brake laboratory vehicle dynamic laboratory structural/RLDA laboratory climate wind tunnel laboratory and noise and vibration laboratory where about 500 engineers are in charge of vehicle engineering. It is equipped with special test roads that are an exact replica of local roads in major export markets. Its climate wind tunnel laboratory was the first in the world to have a Full Automatic Temperature Control (FATC) system that controls temperature and humidity.

The automotive industry is going green and it appears over the next few decades the tried and true internal combustion engine will become a thing of the past.

Right now electric vehicles are the primary replacement. But there are other options. Hyundai Motor Group (HYMTF -1.20%) this week said it plans to offer hydrogen fuel cell versions of all of its commercial vehicles as soon as 2028 and predicted fuel cell vehicles could hit cost parity with battery electric vehicles by the end of the decade.

Hyundai's claim was met with a good bit of skepticism and to be sure fuel cells have a long way to go if they are to reach the company's ambitious 2030 goal. But if it is right there are a lot of companies that would benefit. Here's why three Fool.com contributors will be paying close attention to General Motors (GM -0.33%) Bloom Energy (BE -4.94%) and Plug Power (PLUG -7.58%) as fuel cell tech continues to develop.

Invest in fuel cells and a whole lot more

Lou Whiteman (General Motors): Hydrogen fuel cells in theory sound great. The idea of powering vehicles with clean water as the only emissions would go a long way to fix the greenhouse gas problems we face. The issue is producing the hydrogen is difficult and storing it safely is no easy task.

General Motors has been working on fuel cells for more than 50 years giving it the foundation and technical knowhow to quickly adapt if fuel cells go mainstream as soon as Hyundai hopes. It also has a range of battery and other green powertrains to fall back on in the meantime and is spending more than $35 billion on various forms of clean tech through 2025 to build on the research it has done.

I'm not convinced hydrogen fuel cells will ever be the big winner some hope they will be when it comes to passenger vehicles. What makes GM the best fuel cell stock is the company's work to expand the potential total addressable market for its tech as widely as possible. The company has a deal with Navistar to supply its Hydrotec fuel cell power cubes for use in commercial trucks. It has also partnered with Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies to use its battery and fuel cell technologies on a new generation of freight locomotives. It even is involved in a demonstration project with privately held Liebherr Aerospace to explore the use of hydrogen to power aircraft.

If the transportation industry's green revolution plays out how I think it will with batteries replacing gasoline vehicles and hydrogen replacing larger diesel-powered vehicles General Motors has the potential to win in both areas.

Investing in new technologies is exciting and can be lucrative. But it is important to remember that a lot of great ideas never materialize as bulls hope. With General Motors you get a solid automotive business that is investing for the future and the chance to benefit if fuel cells emerge as an important part of the answer.

A commercial and industrial partner

Rich Duprey (Bloom Energy): Hydrogen fuel cell powered vehicles get most of the attention most notably Hyundai's recent announcement it plans to introduce commercial models by 2028 but Bloom Energy is taking a different route.

It makes stationary fuel cells for commercial and industrial users to generate electricity and counts among its customer base companies including Adobe AT&T Google Intel  and Walmart.

Like all fuel cell technology Bloom's units create no greenhouse gases but its power plants rely upon solid oxide fuel cells instead of the proton exchange membrane molten carbonate or phosphoric acid fuel cells used in other applications.

The U.S. is Bloom's biggest market but South Korea is a world leader in utility-scale deployment of fuel cells such as those Bloom makes. In July it reported it will develop a solid-oxide fuel cell combined heat and power installation in South Korea in partnership with SK Ecoplant. The first-of-its-kind 4.2 megawatt plant will produce 35000 megawatt-hours per year.

Because global governments are intent on implementing policies to reduce greenhouse gases hydrogen fuel cells have an especially promising future. President Joe Biden's multi-trillion-dollar infrastructure proposal has the potential to pour hundreds of billions of dollars into the industry and Bloom Energy because of its focus on reducing or eliminating commercial and industrial carbon emissions could benefit greatly.

Bloom's stock though has ridden the waves of investor interest and ennui surrounding hydrogen's promise. Shares are trading at half the all-time high they hit in February even though Wall Street estimates Bloom will grow earnings at a 25% compounded rate annually for the next five years.

Bloom Energy should be one name in the space that cashes in for investors.

Cash is king -- and Plug Power is king of fuel cells

Rich Smith (Plug Power): Let me be upfront about this: Personally I do not plan on buying any fuel cell stocks in the near future -- my reason being that I prefer to invest in companies that are profitable and right now there aren't any fuel cell stocks that fit that bill.

That being said if I were going to invest in a fuel cell stock Plug Power would be at the top of my list.

Why? Cash. That's why.

Plug Power stock went on a tear last year if you recall eventually rising from less than $4 a share in mid-January 2020 to top out north of $66 a share in mid-January 2021. Now you can argue that this rise in stock price wasn't justified. (Indeed many investors would agree with you. Plug Power today trades for less than half its January 2021 price.) What you cannot deny is that Plug Power made hay while the sun shone. From August 2020 through January Plug completed three separate stock offerings raising a total of $2.98 billion in cash.

As a direct result of these actions Plug Power now sits atop a pile of cash $4.5 billion deep (and its debt load is only $705 million). Compare that to Ballard Power's $1.2 billion in cash (with negligible debt) Bloom Energy's $204 million (with a $1.1 billion debt load) and FuelCell Energy's mere $139 million in cash (offset by $92 million in debt) and it's quite clear -- Plug Power is far and away the fuel cell company with the most financial firepower at its disposal.

It's also quite clear that if success in the fuel cell industry can be bought Plug Power is the company most likely to be able to afford the purchase price. For that matter even if Plug ultimately fails to dominate in hydrogen fuel cells at its current cash burn rate of $368 million per year it will take the company 10 years to run out of cash.

In the long-term race to make hydrogen fuel cell power a global reality my advice is to bet on the company with the most staying power. Right now there's no doubt that Plug Power is that company.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vdWsubW92aWVzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9tb3ZpZXMvZ20tZGlncy1sZy1jb3JwLXNwZWVkLTA0MDYwODI0OS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GM digs in with LG Corp to speed a fix for Bolt battery fires,"By Paul Lienert and Heekyong Yang

(Reuters) - General Motors Co is taking a more direct role with South Korea's LG Corp its longtime electric vehicle partner in tracking down and fixing problems linked to battery fires in Chevrolet Bolts that threaten the strategic plans of both companies.

At an investor conference on Friday GM Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson said LG is working with GM engineers to ""clean up the manufacturing process"" at LG battery plants and implement some ""GM quality metrics.""

Battery plants in South Korea and Michigan operated by LG Energy Solution (LGES) have been identified by GM as the source of defects behind a rash of battery-related fires in the Bolt that have triggered three recalls and $1.8 billion in warranty set-asides by GM since last November - recalls for which GM still has not implemented a hardware fix.

LGES and sister company LG Electronics on Friday reiterated their ""close relationship"" with GM and said the three companies are ""actively cooperating to come up with a final recall plan"" to ""wisely resolve"" battery issues in more than 140000 Bolts - the entire production run since late 2016.

“Experts from GM and LG continue to work around the clock on the issues"" GM spokesman Dan Flores said on Thursday. ""We are determined to do the right thing for our customers and resolve the problem once and for all. Once we are confident LG can provide us with good battery modules we will begin repairs as quickly as we can.”

GM has said early Bolt models will have their entire battery pack replaced while newer models will have only defective modules within the pack replaced. Those new parts may not be available until after November.

In the meantime Bolt owners and prospective EV buyers have unleashed a torrent of complaints and concerns on social media aimed at both GM and LG. It is unclear how much permanent damage either company may sustain from the battery fires.

""Not even Tesla has been slowed by fires"" said Tyson Jominy JD Power vice president of automotive data & analytics. ""I don’t expect this to slow down the EV transition much.""

With resolution of the costly recall debacle still up in the air relations between GM and LG have soured people familiar with the situation said. The partners are stuck in what one Korean analyst deemed a ""show window marriage"" one in which a divorce is unlikely as few immediate alternatives are available.

For now GM's Michigan factory that assembles the Bolt is shut down and its 1000 workers idled until late September.

The automaker said it has bought back some Bolts from owners and is reviewing such requests on a case-by-case basis. GM also has said it expects LG to help shoulder the $1.8 billion expense to replace Bolt battery packs.

On Friday GM's Jacobson said the two companies are having ""high level conversations"" about costs and that GM expects reimbursement.

But the ultimate cost to GM and LG could be even greater. GM is ramping up a $35 billion campaign to launch a new generation of electric and automated vehicles powered by its proprietary Ultium battery technology.

The Ultium batteries GM plans to use in key electric models such as the GMC Hummer EV and electric Chevrolet Silverado are scheduled to be made with LGES in joint-venture factories in Ohio and Tennessee as part of a $4.6-billion investment program.

But following the latest Bolt recall in late August Chief Executive Mary Barra left open the possibility that GM could find new partners for future battery plants.

GM's Ultium cells have a different design size and chemistry than the LG cells in the Bolt and are packaged into modules and packs in a different way.

GM executives also stress that the automaker not LG will control manufacturing and quality control for Ultium batteries.

LG and its affiliates have as much at stake as GM if not more.

The Bolt recalls are not the only ones involving LG batteries. South Korea's Hyundai Motor Co earlier this year recalled nearly 76000 Kona Electric cars worldwide to replace defective battery modules after reports of fires linked to LG batteries made in China.

LG's signature battery technology a thin and flexible rectangular format called pouch cells is one of three different battery types used in electric vehicles.

Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk took a jab at the GM-LG pouch cell technology in a recent tweet writing that ""probability of thermal runaway is dangerously high with large pouch cells. Tesla strongly recommends against their use."" Tesla mainly uses cylindrical cells from several sources including some made in China by LG.

It is not clear what type of cells LGES expects to produce as part of its plan to invest another $4.5 billion in two additional U.S. battery plants. Switching battery cell technology and formats could slow the investment timetable.

On Friday LGES told Reuters: ""We will continue to win orders and proceed (with) our investment in global markets including the United States as planned.""

As the icons performed a medley of their hits — including ""Everlong"" and ""Learn to Fly"" — before receiving the honor drummer Taylor Hawkins' kit blazed a message to the legendary Stones sticks man that read ""Charlie RIP.""

The Foo Fighters have been churning out modern-rock anthems for more than 25 years so when they accepted their award they had a long list of thank-yous.

""We'd like to thank everyone past and present at MTV"" Foo frontman Dave Grohl said before launching into a string of names that included some of the network's most memorable MTV News alums and VJs.

""Kurt Loder Tabitha Soren J.J. Jackson Matt Pinfield Steve Isaacs Amy Finnerty"" Grohl said. ""So thank you all very much for this award. We'll see you in 26 years.""

Grohl and company are the first-ever stateside recipients of the award (it's been given out at global MTV VMA ceremonies) which recognizes not only their success but how they continue to ""inspire and evolve"" MTV said in a release.

To mark the occasion the Foos also performed on the VMAs stage for the first time in more than a decade (their last performance was in 2007).

The band has been a part of VMAs history since they released their eponymously titled album in 1995. Inspired by the memorable Mentos ads the video for their song ""Big Me"" saw the band dressed in overalls and rubber gloves while helping people out of sticky situations. It won them their first Moonman for Best Group Video in 1996. They were also nominated for three other trophies that night: Video of the Year Best Alternative Video and Best Direction.

The following year the group was nominated twice (for Best Rock and Alternative video) for ""Monkey Wrench"" a stylized video for the heavy-rocking single off their sophomore LP The Colour and the Shape.

Foo Fighters have continued to rack up VMA nods over the years: Their single ""Everlong"" was nominated in 1998 ""Learn to Fly"" in 2000 ""Best of You"" in 2005 and ""The Pretender"" in 2008. ""Walk"" won the Moonman for Best Rock Video in 2011. In addition to the Global Icon Award the Foos' new track ""Shame Shame"" snagged three VMA nominations on Sunday for Best Rock Best Cinematography and Best Choreography.

Previous Global Icon Awards at international MTV awards ceremonies include U2 Queen Whitney Houston Green Day and Eminem.

Next month the Foo Fighters are being inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame alongside an illustrious group of artists including Tina Turner Carole King Gil Scott-Heron LL Cool J The Go-Go's and Jay-Z.

It’s time for employers to pay up,"This may come as a shock to some but there’s a different minimum wage for restaurant employees than for workers in most other industries. In Pennsylvania for example that minimum wage is just $2.83 an hour.

Every statein the US has these “tipped wages”. According to minimumwage.org the tipped wage is as little as $2.13 an hour in 19 states and as high as $10 in New York.

Here’s how it works in Pennsylvania: restaurant owners here have to pay their workers just $2.83 an hour (the federal minimum) as long as those employees receive enough tips so that their total hourly wage exceeds the state (and national) minimum of $7.25.

There is a logic to this. State-based tipped wage rules are designed to allow restaurant owners to lower their payroll costs and let customers make up the difference.

To me it’s all still woefully too little but most restaurants take advantage of these tipped wage rules. And who can blame them? It’s legal and common and a significant help towards keeping overhead (and prices) under control. You would think that having to pay an employee a mere $2.83 an hour is enough of a saving. Unfortunately for some restaurants owners it’s not. So they steal.

For example there’s the Bottle Bar East restaurant in Philadelphia which last week was found in violation of these wage (and other) rules and ordered by a federal judge to pay $246457.99 in back wages as well as an equal amount of liquidated damages and civil money penalties to 73 bartenders servers cooks and dishwashers. Some employees were owed as much as $42000. I live in Philly. I won’t be eating there.

I love Italian food but I won’t be eating at Maggiano’s near the convention center in Philadelphia either. Why? Because back in April the geniuses running that location were ordered to pay $116308 in back wages for wage theft that affected 82 workers. The restaurant chain grossed more than $400m in sales in 2019.

Business owners are being accused of stealing from their employees wherever you look.

A class-action lawsuit filed in New York against a popular steakhouse alleges “wage theft and other illegal practices that shortchanged staffers’ pay” which affected about 50 current and former employees. A San Francisco restaurant agreed to pay 22 workers roughly $73000 each for wage violations in a settlement to avoid a costly lawsuit. Two well-known eateries in Nashville agreed earlier this year to pay a combined $1.03m to settle separate lawsuits alleging tip and wage theft. A casino in Pennsylvania agreed to pay $6m to settle a class action lawsuit alleging a failure to pay its tipped employees the proper amount under federal and state law.

There are explanations for these shenanigans and none of them good. Maybe the pandemic put so much pressure on some restaurants that the managers thought that shortchanging employees could help them survive financially. Perhaps their point-of-sale systems were inadequately set up to track tipped wages. Or maybe these same managers were simply taking advantage of their employees’ trust and thought they could get away with it.

One thing’s for sure: those employers are stupid.

Haven’t you seen the news? Good employees are in short supply and that situation isn’t going to significantly change any time in the near future. Not only that but thanks to the pro-labor Biden administration you can count on an uptick in the enforcement of wage and other employment rules during the coming years. If you own a restaurant or a business that employs tipped workers you better make sure you’re educating each and every one of them as to how their pay rate is calculated. You better make sure your systems are in order. You better pay special attention to “pooled tips” and overtime pay. Oh and one other thing: you better make sure not to steal from your workers.

It’s a very bad idea to play games with your employees’ wages. Getting caught will result in significant penalties and a lot of bad press. But even more importantly it’s almost guaranteed to ensure that the best workers will avoid working for you. And customers will avoid you too.

The transformation in the financial industry is progressing. Disruptive technologies increased transparency lack of trust in central instances high speed and changing customer needs are important drivers of digital transformation. Cryptocurrencies and digital assets are coming into play as innovations. These enable financial services to be used in a decentralized manner across the globe via the internet and blockchain technology. The original use case is Bitcoin which enables peer-to-peer (P2P) payments. The next stage of expansion is referred to as Decentralized Finance (DeFi). DeFi has the potential to change the world and enable 1.7 billion unbanked people to access finance.

Definition of Decentralized Finance – In short “DeFi”

DeFi stands for Decentralized Finance. It is a complete open source ecosystem that offers financial services such as loans trading asset management and payments. Dependence on centralized entities is minimized and open to everyone. Interactions are peer-to-peer with smart contracts mainly through the Ethereum blockchain. Ethereum unlike Bitcoin is programmable and provides a marketplace for many applications.

Comparison DeFi versus traditional financial system

Tabular overview of the differences.

Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Traditional financial system Custody The user keeps his money Custody through intermediaries Unit Digital Assets or Stable Coins Fiat money (Swiss franc US dollar Euro etc.) Execution Supported by smart contracts Supported by intermediaries Settlement Within a few seconds / minutes Over several days Availability Availability of the markets

24 h / 7 days Limited opening hours

e.g. Monday – Friday 08.00 h – 17.00 h Clearing Supported by blockchain transaction Supported by clearing houses Governance Managed by developers and users Determination by stock exchanges and regulator Auditability Open source code public ledger testing by everyone Audits by authorized third parties Collateral High collateral required Perception by intermediaries

„Total Value Locked“ (TVL)

The “Total Value Locked (TVL)” is the most common metric to measure the volume of the decentralized financial industry (DeFi). TVL has been rising sharply in recent months reaching over USD 80 billion in August 2021. The largest DeFi categories are Lending with nearly 50% and DEXes (Decentralized Exchanges) with a 34% share.

DeFi applications

DeFi applications and projects fall into five categories. The system continues to evolve and new applications such as insurance digital identities or compliance are added.

DeFi Category Description Projects Lending/Borrowing The biggest share in DeFi applications is in lending and borrowing cryptocurrencies. Lending is an interesting way to generate passive income. The owner deposits his tokens and receives attractively high interest as a countertrade. Aave

Compound

InstaDApp DEXes The well-known central crypto exchanges are Coinbase Binance or Kraken. Coinbase conducted an IPO in April and currently has a market value of over USD 60 billion. With decentralized exchanges (DEXes) trading takes place directly between buyers and sellers through their wallets without a central authority. This dynamic allows for instantaneous trading at a lower cost which is conducted exclusively via crypto tokens against other crypto tokens. Curve Finance

UniSwap

SushiSwap Assets In the traditional financial system assets are held in custody through intermediaries. DeFi Asset Management is a fast growing sector and allows users to manage their own assets (purchases sales transfers). DeFi Asset Management offers new opportunities for investors fund managers or portfolio managers. Convex Finance

yearn.finance

RenVM Derivatives In classical finance a derivative is a contract between two or more parties. The price performance is linked to a specific asset. Ethereum allows an infinite variety of derivatives to be created and hedged via smart contracts without the need for intermediaries. This allows to sell (short) securities on the blockchain like Bitcoin or Tesla. Synthetix

Nexus Mutual

dYdX Payments The advantages of DeFi are perfectly suited to solve the problems of the current global payment systems. Bank accounts are mostly kept in a fiat currency (CHF USD EUR). The disadvantages are high costs and the time required for the sender and recipient to make cross-border payments. Peer-to-peer DeFi payments are more transparent faster and cheaper. Flexa

Tornado Cash

Sablier

Decentralized Finance (DeFi) – Advantages

Access to financial services for everyone and from any location

Availability 7 days a week 24 hours a day

Lower costs due to elimination of intermediaries

High returns

Investments in very small amounts

Full transparency (open source) on the blockchain by viewing the transaction

Reduction of human errors due to manual processes

Innovation of new financial services

Decentralized Finance (DeFi) – Disadvantages

Hacker attacks make the DeFi system vulnerable

DeFi credit transactions require collateral of 100% which limits the circle

Loss of private wallet key (no recovery)

Regulation and consumer protection are still in their infancy

High fluctuation of assets

Implications for banks

The rapid development of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has major implications for banks. How can DeFi be used as an opportunity for banks?

1. Offer of cryptocurrencies

The market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies has reached the incredible level of currently 2 trillion USD (as of August 2021). Bitcoin is still the dominant cryptocurrency with a total volume of over 900 billion USD. Many customers want to safely deposit their crypto assets with their bank and do trading. This customer need is not possible at most banks today. Swiss banks are having a hard time with cryptocurrencies. The reasons for the hesitation are the increased volatility of the currencies lack of know-how or uncertain regulatory requirements. As example: First movers in Switzerland include neobanks SEBA Sygnum or the innovative institution BBVA. BBVA Switzerland offers Bitcoin trading and custody services as well as investments in alternative digital assets.

2. Help shape regulation

Many regulators and central banks are intensively dealing with the topic of cryptocurrencies. The CBDCTracker website shows the current status of developments for CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currencies). Advanced pilot tests are underway in France China and Canada.

Incumbent banks have the opportunity to play an active role in determining future regulation through new technologies. Banks could collaborate with DeFi providers and regulators in this effort. In this way they can develop new innovative offerings in the spirit of “co-creation” and help shape the necessary regulations.

The culture of the compliance department should change from a risk-oriented approach to one that encourages innovation. Developers designers product and compliance people work together in a complementary way and drive innovation along the guidelines.

3. Build bridges

The Coinbase company pioneered how DeFi cooperates with the traditional financial system. On this platform cryptocurrencies and traditional fiat currencies (USD EUR) can be traded. Coinbase’s profits exploded in the first half of 2020 as mass adoption of cryptocurrencies continues.

Incumbent banks could take a cue from Coinbase and offer more crypto services in this new financial system. In particular tech-savvy and risk-averse customers continue to drive demand. Great potential in the future lies in particular with private investors. These are increasingly interested in cryptocurrencies and have already set up crypto test accounts with small amounts. Crypto asset management mandates ETFs funds structured products or lending are interesting services.

Conclusion

Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is capable of fundamentally changing the financial system. Blockchain technology and DeFi make the system more trustworthy cost-effective and transparent. Unbanked people gain access to the economic system and new opportunities open up for investors.

It remains exciting to see how traditional providers will respond. DeFi brings opportunities to generate new revenue streams and position itself as an innovative institution in the New World. Investments in new technologies staff training and customer services will pay dividends for traditional providers.

DeFi’s future prospects are promising and adoption will continue to grow. Still there will be setbacks as in the case of hacking attacks on Poly Network (Source). Regulators are lagging behind the rapid development. The DeFi sector should bring the regulator along for the ride and help shape regulatory requirements. This protects consumers promotes innovation and creates a safer financial system.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZhc3Rjb21wYW55LmNvbS85MDY3NDQ4My90aGUtc2ltcGxlLXdheS10by1tYWtlLWNvbXBhbmllcy1yZXNwb25zaWJsZS1mb3ItdGhlaXItd2FzdGUtbWFrZS10aGVtLXBheS1mb3ItaXTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The simple way to make companies responsible for their waste?

The company has announced that it has raised $250 million at a valuation of $3.7 billion. In March Papaya Global raised $100 million at a company valuation of $1.2 billion after money. Papaya Global's valuation has risen ten-fold since completing its $40 million financing round last September.

This latest financing round was co-led by existing investor Insight Partners and new investor Tiger Global and with the participation of Bessemer Ventures IVP Alkeon Capital Workday Ventures Access Industries and Group 11. This brings to $440 million the total amount raised by the company.

Papaya Global was founded in 2016 by Einat Guez CTO Ofer Herman and CPO Ruben Drong and is the only Israeli unicorn headed by a woman.

Guez said that in 2021 Papaya Global will come ""very near"" to annual recurring revenue (ARR) of $100 million. She added ""We are planning an IPO within the next 24 months but of course it depends on parameters like the situation of the market.""

Papaya is operating in a fast growing international market with more and more companies choosing to employ people in other countries to cope with the shortage of talented employees in their own countries. These companies need solutions that will allow them to pay these employees in their local currencies and according to the laws in the countries where they live.

Papaya's customers include Microsoft Toyota Wix and Intel and it offers a package that combines both software and services.

This latest financing round makes Papaya Global the highest valuation player in the payroll management solutions sector. Rivals include; Deel founded by Israeli-French entrepreneur Alex Buaziz which recently raised $156 million at a company valuation of $1.25 billion; Remote founded in 2019 raised $150 million at a valuation of over $1 billion; and Oyster raised $50 million in June at a company valuation of $475 million.

Israel's fintech startup sector is currently buzzing. Global payment network company Rapyd raised $300 million last month at a company valuation of $8.75 billion tripling its valuation since January and accounts payable tool Melio has reportedly raised money at a valuation of $4 billion up from $1.3 billion at the start of the year.

Tie?,"You never want to tie a game in baseball but on this date the Texas Rangers did so for the first time.

On this date in franchise history the Texas Rangers experienced a franchise first — a tie game.

That moment came on September 12 1974 as the Rangers visited the Chicago White Sox at old Comiskey Park. Just 3821 saw the first tie in Rangers history as the two clubs ended up knotted at 2-2 after six innings before the game was called due to rain.

So why not make up the remainder of the game? Well the two teams did face each other against on September 21-22 in Arlington but neither team needed to play the game as it had no bearing the playoff race.

Now here’s the weird part. The Rangers had two more tied games in the first 10 years of the franchise’s time in Arlington. Both of those games came against the White Sox both of them were played at old Comiskey Park and both were called a tie due to rain.

Also on this date…

September 12 1991: Nolan Ryan and the Texas Rangers defeated the Minnesota Twins 4-3. In doing so Ryan became the second pitcher in Major League history to win at least 10 games in 20 different seasons. The other? Don Sutton who had 10 or more wins in 21 career seasons. Sutton like Ryan is in the Baseball Hall of Fame. Ryan’s victory was also No. 312 of his career that moved him ahead of his former Mets teammate Tom Seaver for 14th place in MLB history.

September 12 1993: Nolan Ryan pitches his final game at Arlington Stadium a 4-2 Twins victory. It just happened to be Nolan Ryan Appreciation Night.

On this date in Texas Rangers history Iván ‘Pudge’ Rodríguez joined a select group of catchers for his work at the plate.

On September 11 1997 Rodríguez and the Rangers were facing the Minnesota Twins at The Ballpark in Arlington. The Rangers won 7-0 and Rodríguez was the biggest reason why.

Pudge went 3-for-4 at the plate driving in five runs and scoring three of his own. But it wasn’t just the hits that did it. It was the home runs.

Rodríguez hit three home runs in the game. He hit a pair off Twins starter Brad Radke both of which were two-run blasts. The other in the eighth inning came off future Rangers reliever Eddie Guardado.

Yes Rodríguez hit three home runs. Big deal right? Yes for catchers. Pudge became just the eighth catcher in Major League history to hit three home runs in a game joining Mickey Cochrane Bill Dickey Don Leppert Bill Freehan Ernie Whitt Mike Stanley and Dan Wilson.

Cochrane and Dickey like Rodríguez are in the Baseball Hall of Fame. Stanley was at one time a teammate of Rodríguez’s as he broke into the Majors with the Rangers in 1986 and played with Texas until 1991. Stanley hit his three home-run game with the New York Yankees in 1995.

Rodríguez ended up with 311 home runs for his career. That put him among a group of seven catchers who hit at least 300 home runs in their career as of 2021.

Also on this date …

September 11 1990: The New York Yankees beat the Texas Rangers 5-4 a win that snapped Texas pitcher Bobby Witt's personal 12-game winning streak.

The data comes from researchers at the University of Chicago who run the Air Quality Life Index (AQLI) which quantifies poor air quality according to lost life years.

They calculate that up to 17 billion life years could be saved if air pollution was brought down to the benchmark for clean air: the WHO guideline of 10 µg/m32. Staggeringly the average exposure for the world’s population to particulate pollution is currently three times that amount at concentrations of 32 µg/m3.

The main cause of this pollution? Fossil fuels – particularly coal. ‘Coal is the source of the problem in most parts of the world’ Professor Michael Greenstone co-author of the report told the Guardian. ‘If these [health] costs were embedded in prices coal would be uncompetitive in almost all parts of the world.’

The report candidly links fossil fuels to the dangers of both climate breakdown and air pollution; it identifies a ‘wildfire feedback loop’ whereby fossil fuel combustion creates both particulate pollution and greenhouse gas emissions the latter of which increases wildfires. Fires in turn fuel both pollution and greenhouse gas emissions escalating the cycle.

However the harms of air pollution are not evenly measured out per global citizen. Instead industrialising parts of the developing world bear the brunt of the damages. For example AQLI estimates that Londoners are losing a few months of life on average. Meanwhile on the Indo-Gangetic plains of Northern India (population 480 million including Delhi and Kolkata) inhabitants are predicted to die over nine years early if 2019 pollution levels persist. These devastating statistics are the reality of life and death under global fossil capitalism.

In some countries there have been improvements in environmental conditions. The report celebrates China’s accomplishments since they declared ‘war on pollution’ in 2014: particulate pollution dropped by 29 percent between 2013 and 2019. These gains account for three quarters of the reductions in air pollution across the world. Although poor air quality still robs 2.6 years of life off the average Chinese citizen strong policies such as restrictions on coal-fired power plants iron and steel making and numbers of cars in cities has made strides forward.

The findings bring into sharp focus the need for a just transition away from fossil fuels everywhere not just in the Global North. Developed countries have a historic duty to assist and finance developing countries in their green transitions to mitigate global warming and draw down polluted air simultaneously; this kind of reparative climate justice is critical not least due to the legacies of colonialism and slavery that built the wealth of much of the Global North and reverberate through global structural inequality today.

For example War on Want and others have estimated that to limit global warming to 1.5°C the UK’s ‘fair share’ contribution to overseas aid is £1 trillion. However the real figures on climate finance are much slimmer. In 2010 at COP16 developed countries pledged a cumulative $100 billion per year in climate finance to address the needs of developing countries for climate adaptation and mitigation. Even this amount is yet to be fulfilled and tracking the true figures is a murky process. The OECD reported levels of $78.9 billion in 2018 but this number has been challenged by researchers.

Meanwhile the needs of developing countries continue to expand. India alone—the most polluted country on the planet according to the AQLI—has calculated climate action will cost $2.5 trillion up to 2030. The most significant burdens are in energy transition and mitigation action plus adaptation for agriculture forestry water resources and ecosystems.

$100 billion equivalent to just four percent of India’s total estimated costs is fundamentally inadequate to overhaul the global fossil economy. The richest countries on the planet are absconding from their responsibilities to secure a liveable breathable planet both at home and abroad.

The impacts of bad air quality are not exclusive to the Global South. Despite big improvements the AQLI shows that almost three-quarters of Europeans still live in areas which exceed WHO guidelines on particulate pollution. And early mortality only tells one story – air pollution also impacts morbidity the rate of illness in a living population. This was tragically laid bare by the death of nine-year-old Ella Kissi-Debrah in 2013 who lived in Lewisham. An inquest found that air pollution contributed both to her developing a rare form of asthma and then to exacerbating the condition.

Although Sadiq Khan is attempting to tackle London’s toxic air by expanding the ultra-low emissions zone targeting the major root cause of particulate pollution means an outright rejection of fossil fuels. Transforming toxic air around the globe requires urgent action and—in the first instance—a restructuring of climate finance to secure support for the Global South. These countries are most dependent on fossil fuels and most fatally impacted by both climate breakdown and dirty air. An inhabitable earth is within grasp with clean air so all of us can live longer and healthier lives."

Retired Goldman Sachs partner Barrie Wigmore and his wife Dee Dee kicked things off with a $500000 gift from their family. The state has promised $4.5 million toward the $6 million project so the ice skating rink facility can host curling events for the 2023 World University Games if Civic Center volunteers are able to raise the rest themselves.

The Wigmores have had a camp on Oseetah Lake for 50 years and Barrie has been a Civic Center supporter for 30 years. Barrie said he remembers as a kid growing up in western Canada skating was big. When his hometown rink burnt down they rebuilt it.

Barrie said it is rare in New York for a civic center to own itself instead of a government or school. He said the Saranac Lake Civic Center is unique in that it is only run by volunteers.

Burgess said they plan to break ground on Oct. 1. This first phase of construction will continue through the winter and will focus on improvements other than the rink itself to avoid disrupting ice time.

He said the next step is to develop a volunteer group to keep the building operating.

“I volunteer to drive the Zamboni!” Kiwanian Andrea Audi offered at a meeting between the Saranac Lake Kiwanis Club Civic Center volunteers and the Wigmores last Thursday.

In the meantime they’re trying to raise $1.5 million.

The Civic Center will mail donation cards to every P.O. box in Saranac Lake and are asking community members to give as much or as little as they feel. They say it all helps and they want the whole village involved. Civic Center board member Ollie Burgess said these improvements will help make the building a true civic center a place for the community year-round.

State and community funding

When Lake Placid won the World University Games bid in 2018 the state Economic Development Council asked if the Civic Center could host curling. Burgess said he’s proud of the rink but it’s not ready for the games yet.

Burgess said the improvements for the games are a “means to an end.” Their goal is not the 10-day event it’s to get a better sports and events space for Saranac Lake which will be used long after the games.

“Important to me is the kids” he said. “Skating for no other reason but the pure joy of skating.”

After “arduous” negotiations with the state Burgess said New York is offering a 75% matching grant through the North Country Regional Economic Development Council. Burgess said this is a rare offer from the state.

Civic Center Project Director Peter Dimmig said this means the Civic Center will get $3 from the state for every $1 it spends. He called it a “once-in-a-lifetime” opportunity.

The state initially offered a 20% match after the project is finished Burgess said. Now they have 75% of the funds front-loaded meaning that when the Civic Center spends on construction it can get reimbursement right away.

Audi said getting grant money fast is crucial to getting small-town projects off the ground.

Burgess believes the Civic Center can raise the first million dollars through wealthy donors around $200000 to $300000 from grassroots community fundraising and then the center can borrow the rest in a loan.

Joe Garso the principal engineer for North Woods Engineering — the engineering firm working on the Civic Center — said that recently Pee Wee Hockey Association Inc. transferred ownership of the building to Saranac Lake Civic Center Inc. a not-for-profit organization.

What work will be done?

The plan is to build out the Civic Center with a new lobby addition built on the east face. There will be a mezzanine with box seats a bigger kitchen and a new ice resurfacer. Currently there are four locker rooms with no bathrooms. The plans show six new locker rooms four with showers and bathrooms.

The most discussed addition is that of heat.

“The Civic Center now is one of the colder spots where the kids play” village Development Board member Bill Domenico said in a meeting last month.

Garso said it’s been a challenge designing the heating system but said the spectator seating areas will be heated. The brine system in the ice-making process will pull heat from the ice and rink floor and recycle it into the building.

“You’re going to be a lot warmer” he said.

At the Kiwanis meeting last week some members worried the spectators will get “soft” with such luxury.

“Sacrilege!” one declared.

Burgess joked that spectators will wear shorts instead of long johns.

The center is currently used around seven months a year. Dimmig said they hope to make it a year-round facility with air conditioning in the summer. The skating season will be extended by around eight weeks — four on either end. The rest of the year it would be used for events.

Better control of heating cooling and humidity means “world-class ice” Burgess said. He said $800000 alone will be spent on the ice-making system.

But curling ice is different from skating ice.

“The World University Games sends in their own ice technicians. They take our ice out” Burgess said.

He said curlers use deionized water with minerals taken out to get more “pure” ice. Also while hockey is played on as smooth an ice surface as possible curlers use a “pebbled surface” with ice beads so the stones have less friction resistance.

Play video content TMZ.com

Jennifer Lopez took Ben Affleck back to where it all started -- namely the block that gave her her nickname ... and the dude seemed to make himself right at home by lighting up.

Bennifer returned to J Lo's stomping grounds Sunday -- this after spending the past few days in Italy where they brought their love fest to the red carpet and beyond. Now it was the Bronx's turn to get a look at the Hollywood power couple ... and they weren't shy.

Eyewitnesses spotted Ben and Jen touring the latter's birthplace borough swinging by a place called Lit Bar in what we're told appeared to be a small biz tour -- with J Lo popping in to show love. BA was tagging along ... and apparently needed a smoke break between stops.

Check out this video TMZ obtained of Benny puffing on a cigarette and waving to fans who noticed him. He inhaled quickly because he was back inside in no time -- but the cat was outta the bag ... because when they exited ... there was a swarm of people with phones out.

Like we said ... they weren't trying to hide their presence -- and you can tell as much by their body language. Jen was giving hand waves and Ben even cracked a smile.

Ya gotta think Ben will bring his boo to his own hometown soon -- Cambridge ain't that far from NYC ... and Bennifer appear to be on the move.

He starred on the football field and like others in his family would later earn a law degree.

But it was the x's and o's of strategy that led him back to Notre Dame where at 25 he became the school's youngest head football coach succeeding a coaching legend named Frank Leahy.

Brennan's tenure as coach of the Fighting Irish lasted five years during the 1950s a significant chapter that would stay with him for the rest of his life.

Brennan who lived in Northbrook Illinois died Sept. 7. He was 93 and had been suffering from congestive heart failure.

His family gathered Friday to celebrate his life in a mass at Saints Faith Hope and Charity Church in Winnetka Illinois.

""He led a very long and eventful life and he was a very humble man and rarely talked about himself"" said his son Terry Brennan. ""It was all about family. His family was what he was most proud of. That was his focus.""

Terence Patrick Brennan was born on June 11 1928 and grew up in Whitefish Bay the second youngest of seven children. His father Martin was a lawyer who played football at Marquette University. His mother Katherine known as Kitty was a homemaker.

""He always regarded himself as the lucky one"" Brennan's son said. ""The support of his family was so helpful to him to accomplish what he did.""

Terry and his older brother Jim were multi-sport stars at Marquette University High School in the 1940's. Besides football Terry played hockey and participated in track and field. His son said he was undefeated in high hurdles and held the school's pole vault record for at least three decades.

Jim headed to Notre Dame first played as a freshman on the football team in 1944 but then enlisted in the U.S. Navy.

It was Jim who talked Terry into going to Notre Dame while also convincing the school that his brother was a fine football player.

Brennan joined Notre Dame as a 17-year-old freshman halfback in 1945 and played four years.

He was 6 feet tall 175 pounds a gifted runner on offense and an aggressive defender. Years later he recalled his most memorable game as a player occurred in 1946 when Notre Dame played Army.

The previous year Notre Dame was routed. But this time the two teams played to a scoreless tie with Brennan making a key interception.

Notre Dame would end up being voted as national champions in 1946.

In 1947 Notre Dame again faced Army in a key game. On the opening kickoff Brennan made an over-the-shoulder-catch and raced 97 yards for the touchdown. He added another score as Notre Dame won 27-7 and repeated as national champions.

Brennan had a chance to go pro with the Philadelphia Eagles of the National Football League and the Chicago Hornets of the old All-America Football Conference. But with a bad knee which was injured during a 1947 game against Tulane Brennan chose to go into coaching.

He ended up at Mount Carmel High School in Chicago where he won three city titles in three seasons. He also managed to fit in studying law earning his degree at DePaul University.

In 1953 he was brought back to Notre Dame to coach the freshman football team.

A year later Leahy citing health concerns stepped down and Brennan was appointed head coach.

He was just 25 and the move astonished the college football world.

Brennan's team went 9-1 in 1954 and 8-2 the next season.

But in 1956 Notre Dame went 2-8. The only bright spot: Paul Hornung won the Heisman Trophy.

Brennan's biggest win as coach occurred in 1957 when Notre Dame snapped Oklahoma's 47-game winning streak with a 7-0 victory. Brennan recently completed a book ""Though the Odds Be Great or Small"" which focused on the triumph.

In a 1980 interview with the Milwaukee Journal Brennan said: ""Actually that team might have been my best. They had beaten us the previous year 40-0 but we played about 18 sophomores on our first two units. We were confident we had them pretty well figured out.""

During his time as coach Brennan was hamstrung as the school limited scholarships for the football team.

According to the Milwaukee Journal after the 1958 season Brennan was given a choice: resign or be fired.

He chose to be fired. On Dec. 21 1958 Brennan was out later replaced by Joe Kuharich.

""Nothing succeeds like success but I'm wondering how you measure success"" Brennan said leaving the school with a record of 32-18.

After his years at Notre Dame Brennan would go on to have a successful career as an investment banker broadcaster and broadcasting executive.

""He was the kind of person who moved forward not backward"" his son said.

Brennan's investment banking career lasted 35 years with stints that included working for Goldman Sachs and Blythe Eastman Dillon and Prudential Bache.

For several years he was a commentator for college football's game of the week with Lindsey Nelson handling play by play.

Brennan and the former Mary Louise “Kel” Kelley were married for 50 years before her death in 2001. Brennan is survived by six children 25 grandchildren and 32 great grandchildren."

“There’s a great debate right now about how much students have learned and what’s safe and what’s not” said Robert Cotto Jr. a Trinity College lecturer who co-authored the research study with Sarah Woulfin an associate professor at the University of Texas at Austin. “I think we need to do a better job of listening to families and saying: ‘What do you need right now to feel safe and for your child to learn?'”

The purpose of the peer-reviewed study — entitled “Choice With(out) Equity? Family Decisions of Child Return to Urban Schools in Pandemic” and published in the Journal of Family Diversity in Education in early September — was not to prove whether parents wanted in-person or remote education but to explore why families chose either option for the fall of the 2020-2021 school year he said.

Parents acknowledged neither option was perfect. “Equity in this case … [means]: Are the school districts providing the supports parents are saying they need when they make a particular choice?” Cotto said. For example were students whose families selected in-person education going to be provided with appropriate health and safety measures such as wearing masks appropriately small class sizes and air purification systems? Did remote families have access to computers internet and reliable child care?

In an online survey the parents told the researchers that schools were able to provide their families with certain key elements but neither learning option fully addressed all of their needs.

“For many families a full set of equity considerations — deeper learning child care safety from COVID-19 — were not all available in either schooling choice” said the study. “Families understood and made choices based on the most important characteristic of partial equity available to them.”

Most parents surveyed chose remote learning for fall 2020

The researchers conducted an online survey available in English and Spanish during August 2020 for families whose children attend school in Hartford. Two-thirds of the respondents lived in the city itself while one-third lived in Hartford County due to the high number of magnet schools that draw from surrounding towns.

About 57% of the 155 survey respondents said they would not send their children back to school buildings while 43% said they would — closely mirroring data shared from the Hartford Public Schools district in early August 2020.

About 45% of respondents were white 36% were Hispanic or Latino 11% were Black or African American and 8% were multiracial. Nearly 70% of families identified as having to work full time and almost 72% had elementary school-aged children. About 45% of all families had children with a “service need” meaning the child might receive special-needs services or may be learning English.

A need for consistent child care

Many families who chose in-person learning pointed to a need for child care during parents’ working hours while families who selected remote learning shared concerns about health and safety measures in schools not being sufficient in their view to prevent coronavirus infections — even if they did not particularly like online learning.

The researchers found a numerical correlation between parents being full-time nonremote workers and choosing in-person school. The connection was reinforced by working parents’ emphasis on child care needs in their personal statements.

“Parents were very clear. They said: ‘I need to go back to my job.’ … Many parents had taken a lot of their vacation time [during] the previous spring” said Cotto. “That was particularly true for many full-time in-person workers.”

Some families also said children needed in-class support from professional educators noted the study and some said students would benefit from relationships with other children and adults in school.

Health and safety concerns

Families who decided to continue with remote learning spoke less about basing their decision on work situations and more about safety concerns based on direct knowledge of their school’s reopening plans and infrastructure said Cotto.

“They knew exactly what their buildings looked like the staffing situation the classroom situation and they said: ‘I do not believe that is safe'” he said. “Even with the masks … there were other features of the building — like windows ventilation — that they did not believe were safe for their children at that time.

“It’s true that many of these parents did have some flexibility. They said ‘I work from home’ or ‘I’m a part-time worker.’ … However there were also full-time working parents who said: ‘No … I’d prefer to stay [in] remote [learning].'”

Black or African American parents who completed the survey selected remote learning more often than other parents the researchers wrote noting: “These responses were clear that safety from COVID-19 drove their decisions to keep children home with some form of remote school even if that was not the preferred mode.”

Some families of color also said aspects of remote learning suited their children better than in-person learning a point Cotto said needs further study.

“I’m not advocating for more remote learning [but] what I’m instead saying is: We need to understand more about what parents and students need in schools and how we can better support them” he said.

A few families who decided to continue with online-only learning also expressed a desire to help the school community keep classroom sizes smaller and give other children a chance to stay safer in an in-person environment.

“It was something I didn’t expect” said Cotto. “You think people are going to do just what their kids need. … It was really remarkable to see those sorts of comments. … It was parents working to help each other in many ways.”

Grand Avenue Hartford WI.

The scenario started Friday morning Sept. 10 2021 as contractors measured how far the crane could extend over the roof as the theatre worked on a remodel project.

After the crane tipped lifting the truck off the ground passing motorists did a doubletake and customers at the hardware store next door couldn’t help but stop and stare. On Saturday two other cranes worked to remove the first.

The video below courtesy Eric Bauer shows how the crane and the truck were finally removed from the building more than 24 hours later.

“I was inside the theatre when it happened” said Bill Schubert owner of the Hartford Theatre. “It landed on two cement brick walls on the roof so it didn’t actually contact the roof. It looks worse than it is.”

Schubert was inside and another woman from Well Spring Church was also inside when it happened. “It scared me. It was loud” Schubert said. “She came running out of her office and I looked out the window and saw the outriggers up in the air and I thought… we have a problem.”

The cranes onsite Saturday were not holding the truck aloft. The cranes did have safety harnesses in place however when the boom shifted it lifted the truck off the ground.

Schubert said nobody was hurt.

The theatre is undergoing a major renovation with a new vending stand new parking lot and new roof. “We just got off to a bad start.. but it’s going to look nice when it’s all done” said Schubert.

Theatre buffs were trying to think of a good movie to debut once the theatre remodel was complete. “Fast and the Furious” or “Speed” with Keanu Reeves were a couple of the blockbusters mentioned as neighbors stood watching the slow-motion crane removal.

It’s rare and risky.

It’s a machine of last resort for hospitals treating patients with COVID-19.

Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation(ECMO) machines have become so needed during the coronavirus pandemic that hospital leaders share them with each other over hundreds of miles.

ECMO machines are for patients who are really on death’s doorstep past the use of a ventilator. There are around 6000 of these machines in the country according to a voluntary database.

Once you’re on one you have less than a 50 percent chance of living.

“If the ventilator is not enough then our team gets activated” said Dr. Gaston Cudemus who runs a team at the Cleveland Clinic in Weston.

The machines act as a mechanical heart and lungs outside of the body pumping a patient’s blood through tubes connected to the neck or groin adding oxygen to the blood and pumping it back into the body. A patient can be on the machine from several weeks to two months waiting for their body to recover after catching COVID-19.

“The lungs are like a balloon. So we take a deep breath and we get oxygen in and we take a breath out and we get oxygen out. COVID one of the things it does is it makes the lungs very rigid” Dr. Cudemus said.

Across the country there are reports of waiting lists because of the pandemic.

“They have become a tool of last resort I want to say” Dr. Matthias Loebe with the University of Miami Transplant Center said.

Dr. Loebe tells NBC 6 the machine is not for everyone because the procedure can be risky and intrusive. It is not always recommended for the elderly or the frail but since hospitals have been filling with younger unvaccinated people they’ve been in high demand.

“You ask me how many machines we have? But the bigger limiting factor is how many beds we have how many nurses we have. The personnel to take care of these patients are in very short supply with this epidemic” Dr. Loebe said.

Hospitals with Memorial Healthcare HCA East and Broward Health also use the machines per spokespeople.

Dr. Cudemus at the Cleveland Clinic tells NBC 6 they’ve been sharing like never before.

“We’re in close communication with all the centers around the area to have the ability to support each other” Dr. Cudemus said.

Doctors usually use these machines when they’re doing organ transplants. Medical professionals say the best way to never get on one an ECMO machine during the pandemic is to get vaccinated social distance and wear a mask in public.",,,,,,,,,

Oil secretary Tarun Kapoor who is also the chairman of Petronet in the firm's latest annual report said the company is looking at setting up a floating terminal at Gopalpur port in Odisha and ""is embarking upon a major diversification drive to broad base its business activity and is exploring to have an ethane/ propane import facility at Dahej terminal"".

Petronet had some years back planned to set up a terminal at Gangavaram in Andhra Pradesh for import of supercooled gas in ships. The company management stopped pursuing that terminal in 2015-16 on grounds that there isn't enough demand to justify a 5 million tonnes/year import facility.

Gangavaram would have been the first terminal on the east coast as Petronet owns and operates facilities at Dahej in Gujarat and Kochi in Kerala.

Soon after that Adani Group began work to set up a 5 million tonnes/year import terminal at Dhamra port in Odisha.

Petronet now sees that there is demand for gas in the eastern region and despite the Dhamra LNG terminal it is now looking for a facility at Gopalpur a source said.

Similarly the company is trying to recapture the lost opportunity in the petrochemical sector.

Petronet's long-term contract for import of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Qatar provided for supply of 5 million tonnes a year of rich gas or gas containing ethane and propane compounds used to make petrochemicals.

That rich gas was supplied to Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) which after stripping it of ethane and propane re-supplies to Petronet for onward sale to power plants fertilizer units and other customers.

The source said ONGC uses the rich gas at its petrochemical plant to make value-added chemicals.

Now Petronet is looking to use the same model.

Petronet ""has also planned for setting up of a petrochemical complex based on imported propane at Dahej LNG Terminal"" Kapoor said in the annual report. ""The foray into petrochemicals would be a forward integration of our strategy as the same planned to get synchronised with our upcoming third jetty project and available land bank at Dahej.""

He however did not give details of the planned petrochemical complex including investment and size of the plant.

Petrochemicals—made using crude and natural gas as feedstock—form raw material for plastics packaging material and personal care products.

In terms of volume the petrochemical market in India stood at 42.50 million tonnes and is estimated to reach 49.62 million tonnes by 2025 expanding at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.14 per cent between FY 2021 and FY 2025.

Using ethane plastics and detergents can be made while propane can give plastic.

Petronet is 50 per cent owned by state-owned refiners Indian Oil Corp (IOC) and Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) gas utility GAIL (India) Ltd and oil and gas producer ONGC. The four companies sit on the board of the company which is headed by the secretary Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas.

Kapoor said Petronet is exploring the possible business opportunities from harnessing the cold energy from its re-gasification terminals at Dahej and Kochi.

""Harnessing LNG's cold energy not only maximises re-gasification terminals' potential but also offers an opportunity to cut emissions in the cold warehousing chain simultaneously adding value and improving energy efficiency"" he said.

After establishing a presence in the southern and western parts of the country Petronet is now planning to set up a floating LNG terminal at Gopalpur port in Odisha with a view to establishing its presence on the eastern coast of India he said.

""The LNG terminal will help meet the increasing gas demand of the eastern and central part of the country"" he said.

He added that Petronet has already completed the pre-project studies and is in process of preparing the detailed feasibility report (DFR) for 4 million tonnes per annum floating storage and re-gasification (FSRU) terminal followed by a pre-feasibility report for a 5 million tonnes land-based terminal in future.

Petronet he said ""has signed MoU (memorandum of understanding) with Gopalpur Ports Ltd and is in discussion with them to finalise the key technical and commercial terms of the agreements"".

Without giving investment details or timelines for the project implementation he said the firm is in process of obtaining the final investment decision for the project.

Dahej terminal is the largest import facility in the country with a nameplate capacity of 17.5 million tonnes per annum. Kochi terminal has a 5 million tonnes nameplate capacity but it operates at a fraction of capacity in absence of pipelines to take the fuel to customers.",,,,,,,,,,,,

At the Haidian District Detention Center a rough prison outside Beijing the electronics sales executive was held in a 300-square-foot cell with dozens of other people standing or squatting for hours a day and sleeping on the grimy tile floor next to a toilet.

As he recounted his seven-month ordeal in a Chinese prison Jade Cheng’s voice quivered and his eyes burned with anger.

“It was a hell for you to suffer” he said in an interview with the Globe his first with local media.

Cheng 40 now lives in Manchester N.H. He said he still has nightmares and his health suffers from his time spent locked up from December 2012 through July 2013 after an international business deal gone bad. He and two of his colleagues Jason Yuyi and Cathy Yu were ultimately released and no charges were ever brought against them.

Now the story of how and why they ended up in detention is at the center of a lawsuit Cheng his two co-workers their families and his Malden-based employer Integrated Communications & Technologies have filed in federal court in Boston against Hewlett-Packard the sprawling electronics giant headquartered in California.

In the suit initiated in 2015 and moving forward this summer they allege that HP defrauded them by selling them damaged and counterfeit networking gear that the company was responsible for their subsequent detentions and that it caused them substantial pain and suffering. They’re seeking unspecified monetary damages.

The origins of the case go back 10 years to when ICT agreed to buy used networking equipment from an HP subsidiary in order to resell it. A different HP subsidiary based in China then complained to authorities that ICT was selling gear with counterfeit labels and ICT’s three salespeople were detained as part of the investigation.

The Chinese police “took it very very seriously” said Alex Styller a Russian emigre who started ICT in 1993 and is also a party to the lawsuit. “They started investigating everything. ... Seven months later they released Jade Jason and Cathy and gave them no-crime letters. They found nothing.”

HP for its part denies it is responsible for any legal wrongdoing.

“We categorically reject these allegations and will vigorously defend ourselves in court” Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. the half of the company that was involved with ICT said in a statement to the Globe. The company’s lawyers have made a host of arguments including that ICT was selling counterfeit gear obtained from other sources and that Chinese authorities not anyone at HP were responsible for the lengthy detentions.

Styller and Cheng said all of the equipment in question was from the HP deal and that HP could have acted quickly and decisively to shut down the investigation by revealing it was the seller. “What they say is completely debunked” Styller said.

Yet all sides agree that in 2011 HP’s financing unit in Andover offered to sell ICT some networking gear that had been leased originally for the Commonwealth Games in India. The routers and other hardware had been made by H3C at the time a wholly owned Chinese subsidiary of HP that the company had acquired when it bought 3Com in 2010.

Styller had Cheng ICT’s Asia Pacific director and his team check with potential Chinese customers about how much the gear might be worth and agreed to pay HP $1 million plus a share of any proceeds over that amount. After an initial payment of $250000 a portion of the equipment was shipped from India to China.

That’s when the trouble began. ICT said HP represented that the gear was lightly used and in good condition. But what Cheng found when he inspected the hardware after it arrived in China was damaged dirty and covered with strange labels. As Styller complained to his HP contacts Cheng still tried to move the merchandise though at heavily discounted prices.

The sales came to the attention of H3C in China which regularly policed the market for counterfeit goods. After inspecting a few of the items ICT was selling H3C filed a complaint with the Ministry of Public Security alleging that labels and stickers on the equipment were fakes and that the sale of counterfeit equipment could pose a security threat to China.

Cheng who worked from the city of Rushan China had no idea the complaint had been filed when on a December morning in 2012 he suddenly was unable to contact his two junior salespeople who were based in Beijing.

It wasn’t until the next day that the police called to say that they had detained the two at the Haidian center.

“I said I don’t believe it” Cheng recalled. “There must be a mistake we got the goods from HP the mother company of H3C.”

Believing he could quickly clear up the situation Cheng gathered documents about the deal and traveled by bus for nine hours to speak with the authorities in Beijing. His wife who is Brazilian and speaks English and Portuguese stayed with his parents who speak only Chinese. His wife worried for his safety but he reassured her that he would free his two colleagues. “I will come back to you very soon” he told them as he departed.

“If I didn’t go who would get our people out?” Cheng recounted. “I didn’t believe I would be arrested. I didn’t prepare myself. I trusted HP made a mistake. I trusted my documents were enough.”

But when the police reached out to HP’s China headquarters in Beijing to check Cheng’s story the HP subsidiary denied the validity of the sales contract Cheng said. A police officer screamed that he was a liar and he was taken into custody.

Cheng was stripped naked for a search X-rayed and fingerprinted and shoved into a freezing shower. After midnight he was placed in a crowded cell with about 45 other men where he would remain for most of the next few weeks.

As the newest entrant he was assigned to sleep on the floor next to the toilet. A typical breakfast was a few grains of rice and pieces of radish in foul-smelling water. Much of the day was spent squatting in place on wooden boards in the cell. Sometimes a window was opened letting in icy blasts of winter air. Nightly inspections by the guards were followed by a freezing shower.

Cheng was reassigned to several other cells during his detention but the conditions never improved. Aside from a few meetings with his lawyer he was allowed no visitors and received only a handful of letters from his family.

Back in the United States Styller was distraught that his employees had been locked up and befuddled at how the HP deal had been subject to attack by another unit of HP.

“I have no idea how China operates” Styller said. “I have no connections there I have no friends. I don’t know what to do.”

Reaching out to his contacts in Andover Styller was eventually put in touch with an HP lawyer in Australia who promised to straighten out the situation.

What happened next is the subject of significant disagreement. According to Styller’s suit HP’s lawyer promised to help free ICT’s people and explain that HP had sold the hardware in question. But in a letter to the Chinese authorities HP did not take responsibility for supplying the gear.

In HP’s version of events its financial services division and even its US headquarters did not have control over the complaint made by H3C. And its letter to the police reflected the company’s honest lack of knowledge about the gear in ICT’s possession its lawyers said.

Chinese prosecutors eventually dug into the documents sent by ICT while Cheng was imprisoned. Cheng Yuyi and Yu who weren’t allowed to see each other in the detention center were interviewed by the prosecutors separately in July 2013. After lunch on July 18 the three learned that the prosecutors’ office was allowing them out on bail.

“There were no words to describe how happy I felt when I stepped out from the gate of the detention center” Cheng wrote in a 2017 affidavit.

A year later the bail expired with no charges brought. In 2016 Cheng and his wife moved to New Hampshire and he rejoined ICT.

The company is a fraction of its former size with just three employees and one warehouse down from 50 employees and three warehouses before the HP mess Styller said.

The legal case has been grinding forward for several years before federal district judge Leo Sorokin. In July HP filed a motion to have the case dismissed arguing there is no proof it supplied any counterfeit gear to ICT and that it could not control the Chinese police.

But before deciding that motion Sorokin on Aug. 18 ordered the parties to try mediation. An alternative dispute resolution hearing which will be closed to the public is scheduled for Oct. 22. There’s no guarantee the mediation will succeed. If it does not and Sorokin does not dismiss the charges the case is expected to go to trial in February 2022.

Two employees walk in the back garden area of Uncle Billy’s Hilo Bay Hotel.

A roughly year-old state effort to have the private sector repair or redevelop two dilapidated hotels on oceanfront public land in Hilo has produced four competitive proposals.

The state Department of Land and Natural Resources received the bids in November after issuing a request for proposals in August 2020 and an evaluation panel is now recommending that one developer be selected to revive both the former Uncle Billy’s Hilo Bay Hotel and the former Country Club Condominium Hotel.

The panel’s recommendation announced Wednesday by DLNR is to select Tower Development Inc. led by Ed Bushor for both revival projects under long-term land leases.

If the agency’s board agrees the deal would give Tower control of three adjacent hotel properties on state land along Banyan Drive fronting Hilo Bay on Hawaii island.

Tower owns and operates the Grand Naniloa Resort which is between the old Uncle Billy’s and Country Club sites.

The two Tower bids which were somewhat packaged as a joint bid won the evaluation panel’s recommendation over two other bids made for only the Country Club site — one from local developer Peter Savio who for a short time operated Uncle Billy’s and one from Tacoma Wash.-based MacDonald Ladd Development LLC.

Savio proposes converting the 152-room Country Club property into an initial mix of hotel rooms and rental housing that would be followed by a closure and extensive renovation after two years to create a revamped full-service hotel under the Pagoda brand.

MacDonald Ladd proposes turning the same property into 65 affordable rental apartments for seniors over four years and partly financed by tax credits.

In its bids Tower said that it is best positioned to improve the two hotel properties and deliver benefits to the state.

“Through its extensive experience in demolition renovation environmental remediation construction development financing its relationship with DLNR and its experience working on the Island of Hawaii and specifically Banyan Drive makes this project and Tower a unique and rare match” the company said in its proposals.

Bushor’s firm repositioned the 320-room Naniloa in 2016 following a $30 million renovation after a prior owner defaulted on DLNR ground lease payments and other debts.

Tower estimates that it would invest between $53.4 million and $58.4 million to rehabilitate the two hotels which would possibly be operated under Hilton brands as is the Naniloa.

The company projects that it would take 30 months to complete design work permitting and construction after reaching a detailed agreement with DLNR.

As an option Tower said it could operate both properties as rental apartments if DLNR has a preference for housing instead of hotel rooms.

Tower also pledged to provide public benefits if its plan is selected including possibly dedicating the Naniloa’s adjacent golf course to DLNR and Hawaii County for conversion into other kinds of public use while also providing three acres of golf course land to create more access to Hilo Bayfront trails and parking for Reed’s Bay Park and Liliuokalani Park.

The development firm also said a key element in its plan is to use a portion of the golf course’s parking lot to provide enough parking for the two hotel properties which lack space to meet parking requirements.

Under Tower’s plan each of the renovated hotels would end up having 100 to 125 rooms refurbished pools a restaurant and retail space.

The former 146-room Uncle Billy’s property would become a Hampton Inn &Suites by Hilton employing 30 to 50 workers. The former Country Club property would become a Home2 Suites or other Hilton limited-service brand hotel employing about 50 workers.

Hilton Worldwide has previously expressed interest in such plans according to letters from 2016 submitted as part of the Tower bids.

Tower said it anticipates having to demolish a third of the buildings on the Uncle Billy’s site at a cost of $5.5 million which would be part of a total project cost between $33 million and $38.5 million. The Country Club site renovation work is estimated at $20.4 million.

The company is offering to pay DLNR $75000 a year to lease the Country Club site for the first decade and then 1.5% more per year over the next two decades.

For the Uncle Billy’s site Tower is offering to pay annual ground rent of $10000 during the first decade $20000 in the second dec­ade and $30000 in the third decade.

Both offers include a first-year rent waiver as part of 65-year leases.

DLNR has been challenged for about seven years to inject new life into the two hotel sites initially developed over 50 years ago.

Uncle Billy’s which was built in phases from 1966 to 1970 was forced to close in 2017 due to safety concerns a year after Savio stepped in for the property’s original operator and tried to keep operations going as the Pagoda Hilo Bay Hotel.

The Country Club hotel was built as the TraveLodge Hotel in 1969. It became a run-down short-term apartment and hotel operation after its land lease expired in 2015 and units remain in use under a month-to-month revocable DLNR permit.

A 2016 analysis by Erskine Architects Inc. for DLNR concluded that both badly deteriorated hotels should be demolished though the assessment also noted possibilities for repair and reuse.

“We believe that the renovation of the properties under new long-term leases as with previously renovated hotels on the peninsula will contribute greatly to the revitalization of Banyan Drive making it a destination for residents and tourists alike” DLNR Director Suzanne Case said in a March announcement.

The evaluation committee includes representatives of DLNR Hawaii County’s Banyan Drive Hawaii Redevelopment Agency and the state Department of Business Economic Development and Tourism.

DLNR previously expected to make a tentative selection in December then later said an announcement was expected in April. Now the agency said the panel’s recommendation could be presented to its board as early as Sept. 24.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9wZW5wci5jb20vbmV3cy8yMzg5MzEzL2FwYXJ0bWVudC1ob3RlbC1tYXJrZXQtaXMtZGF6emxpbmctd29ybGR3aWRlLXdpdGgtYWNjb3ItaG90ZWxz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Apartment Hotel Market Is Dazzling Worldwide with Accor Hotels Extended Stay America Marriott International,"Apartment Hotel Market Is Dazzling Worldwide with Accor Hotels Extended Stay America Marriott International

After Emma Raducanu’s thrilling US Open victory it appears the tennis tournament is not done with its gift giving having inspired an iconic Paris Hilton moment.

At the first men’s semi-final at Flushing Meadows in New York on Friday the crowd which included the 40-year-old socialite were treated to Paris’s one hit wonder Stars Are Blind.

As the first few bars of the song’s chorus played over the court’s sound system during a break in play between Felix Auger-Aliassime and eventual victor Daniil Medvedev Paris was here to deliver to spectators beaming as she sang along to the track with some shoulder shimmying and arm raising.

With the camera trained on her her presence was broadcast to her fellow attendees with fans waving over to her box as they clocked she was there.

Also in very relatable fashion it appears Paris wasn’t 100% sure on the words to begin with employing a wide smile and moving her lips just enough to be sort-of mouthing along (probably).

Paris took to her Instagram on Saturday to share the clip with her followers and thank US Open organisers for playing the track – and we stan a gracious queen.

‘Love that they played my song #StarsAreBlind at the @USopen’ Paris wrote with a sprinkling of emojis.

‘It was such an #iconic moment hearing it played in the giant stadium with my fiancé. #LovesIt #USTAfoundation.’

Fans and famous pals flooded her Instagram comments with their appreciation for the moment with Orange is the New Black actress Taryn Manning posting: ‘Made my day 🙌’

Nicole Scherzinger also enjoyed it commenting ‘Yaaaaas sis!!!!’ while Paris’ sister Nicky posted a row of hands in the air emojis.

Paris also shared a fan’s Story of the moment (Picture: Instagram/parishilton)

Paris’s businessman fiancé Carter Reum was also delighted to have experienced it first-hand saying: ‘Longest and best Jumbotron dance ever! 🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️ thanks @tennischannel Ken Solomon and @pinskyjs1!’

Stars Are Blind was released as the lead single for the OG reality star’s debut album Paris in 2006 and reached 18 on the US Billboard Hot 100 as well as number five in the UK four in Ireland and getting into the top 10 in more than 10 European countries.

It also made Paris an official chart-topper in Hungary Scotland and Slovakia although she has since turned to a very successful career as an international DJ.

Carter and Paris also added to the excitement of their weekend by throwing an engagement party on Saturday attended by the likes of Kris Jenner and her partner Corey Gamble.

The pair will also have their upcoming nuptials shared with the world via new reality TV series Paris in Love which has been commissioned by US streaming service Peacock and is currently shooting.

HD,Home Depot,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhlcmFsZG5ldC5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvbGF3c3VpdC1ob21lLWRlcG90LWRvZXNudC1naXZlLXdvcmtlcnMtZW5vdWdoLWJyZWFrcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lawsuit: Home Depot doesn't give workers enough breaks | HeraldNet.com,"The suit could cover at least 10000 employees across the retailer’s 45 locations in Washington.

EVERETT — Home Depot stores in Washington don’t give its hourly employees their legally-required breaks alleges a lawsuit filed late last month against the company.

The potential class action suit filed in Snohomish County Superior Court could cover at least 10000 employees across the home improvement retailer’s 45 locations in Washington.

State regulations require employees be allowed a 30-minute meal break between the second and fifth hours of their shift. Employers are also mandated to give workers rest breaks of at least 10 minutes every four hours. Home Depots like the one in Everett did not comply with these requirements the 10-page complaint claims. The lawsuit says this occurs because Home Depot stores are “intentionally staffed at minimal levels” causing chronic understaffing.

“It’s a safety issue in a lot of occupations and a human decency issue in all of them” Seattle attorney Duncan Turner said.

Turner is no stranger to high-profile cases. He was the lead attorney for thousands of workers in SeaTac who sued their employers for not paying a $15 per hour minimum wage. That lawsuit ended in an $8.2 million settlement for the employees.

Companies also must keep records of workers including dates of employment hours worked and wages. Those records have to be available to the employees upon request.

“Because of its chronic understaffing Home Depot’s hourly retail employees are often unable to take the meal and rest breaks required by law and Home Depot fails to accurately keep track of the missed breaks and fails to compensate these workers for the missed breaks” the lawsuit argues.

The model worker in this case for these concerns is Richard Didzun. In 2015 he trained at a Home Depot in Bothell. Then until 2019 he worked at the retailer’s Everett location before moving to the Aberdeen store last September.

Home Depot also faces a lawsuit in federal court brought on behalf of the retailer’s hourly-paid supervisors and specialists. The complaint in that case which originated in King County last June claims supervisors often miss their rest and meal breaks because of understaffing. Dozens of employees from across Washington however have filed statements in court saying they rarely if ever missed breaks.

One employee at the Home Depot in Everett wrote there was a document next to the time clock saying workers must take lunch before the fifth hour of their shifts. Another staffer at the store in Snohomish said his meal breaks were late at least half of the time. He got rest breaks 10% of the time the employee wrote in court documents.

Home Depot officials could not be reached for comment.

Most of the workers covered in the new lawsuit won’t overlap with those in this federal case Turner said.

Attorneys haven’t started reaching out to workers like Didzun who could have missed breaks. The case isn’t considered a class action lawsuit until it is certified as such by a judge Turner said.

Despite his allegations Didzun likes Home Depot Turner said.

“He just thinks he should be entitled to a break and everybody else should” he said.

Its co-founder Bernie Marcus also publicly endorsed Trump urging other people to do so. However these actions were met with backlash from the public. As a result The Home Depot sought to distance itself from the statement.

Craig Menear is an inspiration to all the upcoming businesspersons. His skills can be looked up to and learned from. Through his hard work and consistency he has ensured that he remains on top of the game throughout most aspects in life.

Whistleblowers at the Honeywell plant in Newhouse have made a series of damning allegations about the PPE factory which was unveiled by former health secretary Matt Hancock after getting the deal to manufacture 70 million face masks during the coronavirus pandemic.

They claim workers were routinely ""humiliated"" and ""bullied"" by bosses.

Five female whistleblowers all experienced production staff said workers were timed by managers and forced to meet “impossible” targets of making 600 medical-grade masks per hour. They also claim that when they went to go to the toilet intimidating bosses stood over them and ordered them not to leave their seats.

Staff who struggled to meet targets even those who were older or had disabilities were reprimanded with some even losing their jobs.

They were also forced to work in ""sweatshop conditions"" after the factory’s air con system failed and when they bought their own fans in were told not to use them.

One said: “We worked through lockdown doing this important job to help keep people safe yet we were shown no respect and treated like second-class citizens.

“I’m a hard worker and never had a day off in my life but I couldn’t even go to the toilet without folk watching me. You could only go if nobody else had gone so you often had to wait a long time and they’d time you.

“It was so degrading and as a result of not being able to go to the toilet freely at work I ended up getting a bad kidney infection. We were stressed out worried about potentially losing our jobs and you’d see staff crying all the time or walking out.

“We were not allowed to move off our seats not even to stretch. When I questioned this I was told if I wanted to exercise I could get up and dance.

“When I asked why I was being timed I was told it was to make sure I was doing my job right. I’ve worked in factories before and never experienced this – it was so disrespectful.”

The woman who ended up walking out one day said she and the rest of her team were originally set a target of making 450 masks an hour but that increased to 600 after the firm installed new machinery.

She added: “While they were getting the new machinery in they paid us off for a month and when we came back we were told we were expected to hit this much higher target yet never received proper training for the new machinery.

“Some workers were in their 60s and some had conditions like arthritis mental health problems and other disabilities but there was never any regard for that or compassion given by managers.

“I was also concerned because these masks we were making were going to be used by people on the frontline – doctors and nurses and care home staff – so the emphasis should have been on quality rather than quantity.

“It was also boiling hot the whole time. There was an air con system but it was beyond useless so we all bought fans as the sweat would be pouring off us as we desperately tried to hit targets.

“Then one day the managers said we weren’t allowed to use the fans so we were basically working in pools of sweat. My pants were soaking we couldn’t see out of our glasses my hair was soaking.

“We approached the manager to express our concerns and she agreed it was wrong but said her hands were tied because the decisions were made higher up.”

A second woman was paid off without warning because she struggled to meet her targets.

A third worker said she was told she wasn’t allowed to move off her seat and when she struggled to meet her targets she was let go.

A fourth worker told how she worked constantly during lockdown and at one point did nine 12-hour shifts in a row.

She said the job ended up “getting the better of her” because of the bad conditions and being unable to meet the “impossible” targets so she ended up walking out.

The fifth whistleblower said she had never had a day off work sick or been late and claimed she was sacked after complaining about a senior member of staff.

Some of the staff complained to Honeywell and Manpower the recruitment firm who had employed them.

They then raised the issues with Central Scotland MSP Richard Leonard who failed to get a response from Honeywell.

He said: “The conditions described to me were awful. They belonged to the century before last.

“Workers being told to stay on their seats or ‘get up and dance’ if they needed to exercise.

“As part of a culture of harassment they were regularly timed by managers and supervisors on mobiles and set production targets that were almost impossible to meet.

“And of course as agency workers if they didn’t work they didn’t get paid.

“The harsh daily reality they faced was to feed a family and keep a roof over their head they had to put up with indirect and direct harassment.

“What makes this even worse is these workers were making masks to protect people from Covid – key workers labouring to keep us safe.

“I’ve called on their employers to make changes and make them now – no-one should experience this treatment at work.”

Debbie Hutchings of Unite union said: “Unite is deeply alarmed at allegations being brought forward by agency workers at Honeywell.

“It’s unacceptable and even more shocking because this appears to be happening while producing PPE products to save lives.

“We have no collective bargaining or recognition for some areas on site including the one where the workers have been supplied through agency Manpower.

“Nonetheless we have raised these allegations with Honeywell management as a matter of urgency and told them that this situation must be immediately addressed.

“We can’t have workers being treated in such unequal and unfair ways on site.”

The Scottish Government said: “The concerns raised about this UK Government contract are deeply troubling and should be investigated thoroughly.”

Honeywell said: “In partnership with the UK Government Honeywell is committed to providing PPE for frontline healthcare workers.

“We abide by all laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate and expect our contractors to do the same.

“Honeywell provides safe and secure working environments and treats employees including contingent workers in an ethical manner.

“The complaints made by personnel contracted by Manpower are inaccurate and tarnish the hard work employees are putting in to combat the pandemic.”

Manpower was contacted but declined to comment.

The UK Government failed to respond to a request for comment.

Nasdaq-listed Honeywell confirmed that it signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Saudi Aramco to explore the commercialization of next-generation digital technology solutions designed to improve productivity sustainability and operational excellence of industrial firms on a global scale.

The fully digital technology will leverage Aramco’s plant digital system as well as technical and domain knowledge in end-to-end plant operations along with Honeywell’s global software development and commercialization expertise.

The technology will be brought to market through a joint venture (JV) between the two companies that will also serve as a software system integrator to reduce time-to-value for customers.

In addition the next-generation technology will provide industrial companies with the tools processes and practices they need to run plant operations more effectively. It will also accelerate sustainable digital transformation and operational excellence initiatives across industries.

This dynamic entity will emphasize on the development and deployment of operations technology (OT) solutions and digital transformation consulting.

This JV is expected to create more than 500 jobs in Saudi Arabia within five years of its launch supporting the country’s In-Kingdom Total Value Add (IKTVA) Program designed by Aramco to boost Saudi economic and workforce development.

On Sept. 7 Aramco announced a major expansion of its industrial investment program “Aramco Namaat” with the signing of 22 new memoranda of understanding (MoUs) and one JV agreement according to data compiled by Argaam.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vb2JpdHMuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9kYWxsYXNtb3JuaW5nbmV3cy9uYW1lL3JheW1vbmQtYmVsbC1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0xOTY3NDk0NdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Raymond Bell Obituary (1932 - 2021) - Dallas TX - Dallas Morning News,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://obits.dallasnews.com/us/obituaries/dallasmorningnews/name/raymond-bell-obituary?id=19674945 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vb2JpdHMuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9kYWxsYXNtb3JuaW5nbmV3cy9uYW1lL3JheW1vbmQtYmVsbC1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0xOTY3NDk0NdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFtMTEwMHRoZWZsYWcuY29tL2Zvcm1lci1mZG55LWNvbW1pc3Npb25lci10aG9tYXMtdm9uLWVzc2VuLWNvbW1lbW9yYXRlcy10aGUtMjB0aC1hbm5pdmVyc2FyeS1vZi05MTHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Former FDNY Commissioner Thomas Von Essen commemorates the 20th anniversary of 9/11,"He spent more than two decades as a firefighter before he was at the helm of the Fire Department of New York (FDNY) from 1996 to 2002.

Bethesda Maryland-based Host Hotels & Resorts ended 2023 with $2.9 billion of available liquidity an amount that President and CEO Jim Risoleo said gives the REIT an advantage in negotiating acquisitions once attractive hotels and resorts hit the market.

""Frankly there just aren't a lot of properties that are currently listed for sale certainly not assets that would interest Host but that's really not slowing us down at all"" Risoleo said. ""We are talking to our competitors in the industry our friends in the industry and others to try to kick deals loose that are Host-type assets.

""We are leaning on our relationships. We're leaning on our reputation on our ability to close deals all-cash and that really gives us a very meaningful competitive advantage. And we believe this is the year to to get the balance sheet to work.""

Ideally the U.S. Federal Reserve will soon announce the first of several interest rate cuts Risoleo said and that will bring sellers out of hibernation.

""It's going to also spark competition for those assets"" that will come to market he said. ""Our point of view is we have the balance sheet; we can do it all. We want to get out there and we want to get ahead of the pack. And I hope over the course of the next several months that we're going to be able to tell you that we've been a net acquirer early in 2024.""

Asked about the wave of commercial mortgage-backed securities maturing this year and next and whether that will drive hotel sales Risoleo said the wall of distress hasn't materialized.

""This year there's about $26 billion of full-service loans that will be maturing and I know that earlier in the pandemic there was a lot of talk of distress"" Risoleo said. ""Frankly we haven't seen it materialize certainly not on assets or markets that would interest us. But we'll continue to track it.

""There may be pressure as we get later into the year because one of the things that other hotel owners are going to have to deal with sooner or later is reinvesting in their portfolio.""

Host is interested in acquiring large hotels and resorts with diverse demand drivers in the group business transient and leisure segments. Risoleo added ""bigger is better for us"" and that acquiring hotels in urban markets might be on the table again.

What's Next for Maui

Host's resorts on Maui — the Hyatt Regency Maui Resort and Spa the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani — continue to skew the performance of the REIT's portfolio as leisure demand decreased following the wildfires in August. Yet Host's Maui properties have benefited from a steady source of group demand.

Sourav Ghosh Host's executive vice president and chief financial officer said 2023 was ""the year of group and convention hotel recovery"" adding that group room revenue increased 21% year over year and the volume of group room nights sold recovered to 95% of 2019 levels.

""It is worth noting that our group results were positively skewed by disaster and recovery bookings in Maui"" he said. ""Group room revenue exceeded 2022 by 13% in the fourth quarter driven by an increase in both rate and room nights and we estimate roughly half of that growth can be attributed to recovery and relief groups on Maui.""

Efforts to rebuild Lahaina are ongoing and Risoleo said the west side of Maui will take more time to recover.

""In the interim we have been working with relief agencies in particular the Red Cross. We have contracted with the Red Cross for 350 rooms at the Hyatt Regency Maui through the end of May and we're hopeful that that will be extended while the recovery moves forward"" Risoleo said.

Host is also awaiting a resolution to Hawaii Gov. Josh Green's threat to ban short-term rentals if they aren't opened up as housing for displaced residents. In December Green said the state needed approximately 3000 short-term rental units set aside for Maui residents.

""March 1 is a pivotal date in our mind"" Risoleo said. ""The governor of the state of Hawaii has stated that if the owners of short-term rentals on Maui don't come to terms with allowing their units to be utilized by the displaced residents then he is considering a ban on short-term rentals. ... On the island of Maui in total there's about 30000 short-term rentals. It's quite significant and we're tracking it very closely.""

Risoleo added he hopes leisure travelers will return sooner to Host's two resorts in the Wailea area: the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani. Host concluded 2023 by wrapping up a renovation of the Fairmont Kea Lani's lobby and guestrooms in December.

""We're confident that over time as the consumer begins to understand the differentiation between Wailea which is a completely different submarket than the west side and Ka'anapali that will lead the cadence of business pickup"" he said.

Full-Year Outlook and Earnings Highlights

In its 2024 outlook Host Hotels & Resorts forecasts hotel revenue per available room to grow between 2.5% and 5.5% over 2023.

Called the Rayo it was unveiled at the Hampton Court Concours d'Elegance in the U.K. last week.

The Rayo is based on a Lamborghini Huracan and features bespoke carbon-fiber bodywork and an upgraded engine. The 5.2-liter V-10 received twin turbochargers from Underground Racing boosting output from the stock 601 hp to a claimed 1900 hp.

7X targets a top speed of 300 mph according to another company Envisage Group which made the Rayo's carbon-fiber bodywork and assembled the car. To achieve that goal the Rayo features meaningful aerodynamic improvements over the donor Huracan in this case an LP 610-4.

7X Design Rayo

The drag coefficient has been reduced to 0.279 from the stock 0.39 according to Envisage. New body panels were designed by scanning the base vehicle's structure to ensure a proper fit. The Rayo also sports headlight eyelashes a nod to the Lamborghini Miura.

7X hasn't discussed building customer copies of the Rayo. It previously quoted a $2 million price (plus the cost of a donor car) for duplicates of its previous coach-built supercar the Ferrari 488 GTB-based GTO Vision.

It's worth noting that the Rayo is based on an older version of the Huracan. Since the LP610-4 launched Lamborghini has launched more-aggressive versions most recently with the track-focused STO. Short for Super Trofeo Omologato the STO was envisioned as a road-going version of the Huracan Super Trofeo Evo race car. In contrast to the Rayo's focus on top speed the factory-built STO was designed to quick lap times with aerodynamic changes primarily aimed at increasing downforce.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJvc3Rvbmdsb2JlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA5LzEyL2J1c2luZXNzL21hbGRlbi1maXJtLXN1aW5nLWNvbXB1dGVyLWdpYW50LWhwLW92ZXItY2hpbmEtZGVhbC1nb25lLXdyb25nL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Malden firm suing computer giant HP over China deal gone wrong,"Cheng was not allowed to have contact with anyone outside the detention center beyond his lawyer not even his wife.

At the Haidian District Detention Center a rough prison outside Beijing the electronics sales executive was held in a 300-square-foot cell with dozens of other people standing or squatting for hours a day and sleeping on the grimy tile floor next to a toilet.

As he recounted his seven-month ordeal in a Chinese prison Jade Cheng’s voice quivered and his eyes burned with anger.

“It was a hell for you to suffer” he said in an interview with the Globe his first with local media.

Cheng 40 now lives in Manchester N.H. He said he still has nightmares and his health suffers from his time spent locked up from December 2012 through July 2013 after an international business deal gone bad. He and two of his colleagues Jason Yuyi and Cathy Yu were ultimately released and no charges were ever brought against them.

Now the story of how and why they ended up in detention is at the center of a lawsuit Cheng his two co-workers their families and his Malden-based employer Integrated Communications & Technologies have filed in federal court in Boston against Hewlett-Packard the sprawling electronics giant headquartered in California.

In the suit initiated in 2015 and moving forward this summer they allege that HP defrauded them by selling them damaged and counterfeit networking gear that the company was responsible for their subsequent detentions and that it caused them substantial pain and suffering. They’re seeking unspecified monetary damages.

The origins of the case go back 10 years to when ICT agreed to buy used networking equipment from an HP subsidiary in order to resell it. A different HP subsidiary based in China then complained to authorities that ICT was selling gear with counterfeit labels and ICT’s three salespeople were detained as part of the investigation.

The Chinese police “took it very very seriously” said Alex Styller a Russian emigre who started ICT in 1993 and is also a party to the lawsuit. “They started investigating everything. ... Seven months later they released Jade Jason and Cathy and gave them no-crime letters. They found nothing.”

HP for its part denies it is responsible for any legal wrongdoing.

“We categorically reject these allegations and will vigorously defend ourselves in court” Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. the half of the company that was involved with ICT said in a statement to the Globe. The company’s lawyers have made a host of arguments including that ICT was selling counterfeit gear obtained from other sources and that Chinese authorities not anyone at HP were responsible for the lengthy detentions.

Styller and Cheng said all of the equipment in question was from the HP deal and that HP could have acted quickly and decisively to shut down the investigation by revealing it was the seller. “What they say is completely debunked” Styller said.

Yet all sides agree that in 2011 HP’s financing unit in Andover offered to sell ICT some networking gear that had been leased originally for the Commonwealth Games in India. The routers and other hardware had been made by H3C at the time a wholly owned Chinese subsidiary of HP that the company had acquired when it bought 3Com in 2010.

Styller had Cheng ICT’s Asia Pacific director and his team check with potential Chinese customers about how much the gear might be worth and agreed to pay HP $1 million plus a share of any proceeds over that amount. After an initial payment of $250000 a portion of the equipment was shipped from India to China.

That’s when the trouble began. ICT said HP represented that the gear was lightly used and in good condition. But what Cheng found when he inspected the hardware after it arrived in China was damaged dirty and covered with strange labels. As Styller complained to his HP contacts Cheng still tried to move the merchandise though at heavily discounted prices.

The sales came to the attention of H3C in China which regularly policed the market for counterfeit goods. After inspecting a few of the items ICT was selling H3C filed a complaint with the Ministry of Public Security alleging that labels and stickers on the equipment were fakes and that the sale of counterfeit equipment could pose a security threat to China.

Cheng who worked from the city of Rushan China had no idea the complaint had been filed when on a December morning in 2012 he suddenly was unable to contact his two junior salespeople who were based in Beijing.

It wasn’t until the next day that the police called to say that they had detained the two at the Haidian center.

“I said I don’t believe it” Cheng recalled. “There must be a mistake we got the goods from HP the mother company of H3C.”

Believing he could quickly clear up the situation Cheng gathered documents about the deal and traveled by bus for nine hours to speak with the authorities in Beijing. His wife who is Brazilian and speaks English and Portuguese stayed with his parents who speak only Chinese. His wife worried for his safety but he reassured her that he would free his two colleagues. “I will come back to you very soon” he told them as he departed.

“If I didn’t go who would get our people out?” Cheng recounted. “I didn’t believe I would be arrested. I didn’t prepare myself. I trusted HP made a mistake. I trusted my documents were enough.”

But when the police reached out to HP’s China headquarters in Beijing to check Cheng’s story the HP subsidiary denied the validity of the sales contract Cheng said. A police officer screamed that he was a liar and he was taken into custody.

Cheng was stripped naked for a search X-rayed and fingerprinted and shoved into a freezing shower. After midnight he was placed in a crowded cell with about 45 other men where he would remain for most of the next few weeks.

As the newest entrant he was assigned to sleep on the floor next to the toilet. A typical breakfast was a few grains of rice and pieces of radish in foul-smelling water. Much of the day was spent squatting in place on wooden boards in the cell. Sometimes a window was opened letting in icy blasts of winter air. Nightly inspections by the guards were followed by a freezing shower.

Cheng was reassigned to several other cells during his detention but the conditions never improved. Aside from a few meetings with his lawyer he was allowed no visitors and received only a handful of letters from his family.

Back in the United States Styller was distraught that his employees had been locked up and befuddled at how the HP deal had been subject to attack by another unit of HP.

“I have no idea how China operates” Styller said. “I have no connections there I have no friends. I don’t know what to do.”

Reaching out to his contacts in Andover Styller was eventually put in touch with an HP lawyer in Australia who promised to straighten out the situation.

What happened next is the subject of significant disagreement. According to Styller’s suit HP’s lawyer promised to help free ICT’s people and explain that HP had sold the hardware in question. But in a letter to the Chinese authorities HP did not take responsibility for supplying the gear.

In HP’s version of events its financial services division and even its US headquarters did not have control over the complaint made by H3C. And its letter to the police reflected the company’s honest lack of knowledge about the gear in ICT’s possession its lawyers said.

Chinese prosecutors eventually dug into the documents sent by ICT while Cheng was imprisoned. Cheng Yuyi and Yu who weren’t allowed to see each other in the detention center were interviewed by the prosecutors separately in July 2013. After lunch on July 18 the three learned that the prosecutors’ office was allowing them out on bail.

“There were no words to describe how happy I felt when I stepped out from the gate of the detention center” Cheng wrote in a 2017 affidavit.

A year later the bail expired with no charges brought. In 2016 Cheng and his wife moved to New Hampshire and he rejoined ICT.

The company is a fraction of its former size with just three employees and one warehouse down from 50 employees and three warehouses before the HP mess Styller said.

The legal case has been grinding forward for several years before federal district judge Leo Sorokin. In July HP filed a motion to have the case dismissed arguing there is no proof it supplied any counterfeit gear to ICT and that it could not control the Chinese police.

But before deciding that motion Sorokin on Aug. 18 ordered the parties to try mediation. An alternative dispute resolution hearing which will be closed to the public is scheduled for Oct. 22. There’s no guarantee the mediation will succeed. If it does not and Sorokin does not dismiss the charges the case is expected to go to trial in February 2022.

Laptops are meant for productivity and they do the job well. But someone has to draw a line between a laptop for work and one for personal use. The Pavilion Aero 13 is the closest laptop I can think of that redefines what a truly “personal computer” should be. This Pavilion notebook feels premium thanks to its extremely lightweight design weighing just 970 grams. It sounds too nice to be true considering the Aero 13 is priced at Rs 79999.

Here’s our review of the HP Pavilion Aero 13.

HP Pavilion Aero 13 price in India: Rs 79999

HP Pavilion Aero 13: Design and aesthetics

Traditionally the Pavilion range is reserved for budget laptops. It is the Envy range that HP uses to show the design prowess and fancy features in premium laptops. But the Pavilion Aero 13 is getting all the high-end features that are usually reserved for premium notebooks.

To begin with the Aero 13 is made of a magnesium-aluminum alloy and its beautifully simple construction stuck in my head throughout the testing period. My review unit has this gold finish which immediately attracts you and feels contemporary.

What makes the Aero 13 so unique is its light and thin form factor. At 2.1 pounds (roughly 970 grams) HP Aero 13 is one of the lightest notebooks you can buy. The LG Gram 14 is another competing ultraportable notebook in this space. Although travel has been restricted due to the pandemic I am pretty sure the Aero 13 will become the go-to notebook for many who are always on the go.

The Aero 13 looks modern with its thin bezels with a 90 per cent screen-to-body ratio. The hinge is strong and there is no wobble to the screen. You get a full-size HDMI 2.0 port USB-A port and USB-C port along the left-hand side and a second USB-A port on the right. What it lacks is the support for Thunderbolt (it’s an AMD-powered machine) as well as an SD card reader. And yes there is no 1080p camera. Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.2 offer wireless connectivity.

HP Pavilion Aero 13: Display and sound

The Aero 13 is HP’s first notebook with a 16:10 aspect ratio display. Simply put the screen is taller bezels are smaller and you get more screen space without increasing the footprint of the laptop. The 13.3-inch IPS panel (1920x1200p) is very bright and vibrant. You can even play games or watch videos in direct sunlight without any glare. Viewing angles are great as is the contrast. The sound from the bottom-mounted Bang & Olufsen (B&O) speakers isn’t great but they seem fine for attending Zoom calls or for casual music.

HP Pavilion Aero 13: Keyboard and touchpad

I am a big fan of the keyboard found on HP’s high-end Spectre range. This one though doesn’t match that level though it is still comfortable to use on the Aero 13. It has decent key travel though lacks the clickiness one would find on high-end notebooks. The Aero 13’s keyboard feels light and fast and I find it a breeze to type on. There’s a backlight like in other devices of this price range. The touchpad is large and spacious and has a smooth surface while supporting Microsoft’s Precision touchpad drivers.

HP Pavilion Aero 13: Performance and battery

In terms of the Aero 13 configurations my review unit came with the AMD Ryzen 5 5600U processor with Radeon graphics 16 GB RAM and 512GB of storage. Is it fast? The short answer is absolutely yes! It’s no surprise that it’s faster than your old Windows notebook or previous-generation MacBook Air. I haven’t benchmarked it but I can tell you this notebook is going to be a lot faster. I edited a couple of videos performed some photo editing tasks and it could handle all my daily Chrome tabs without crashing. This notebook can be used for gaming though keep your expectations low.

Battery life is interesting on the Aero 13. I got close to 10 hours of battery life when running my screen at 50 per cent brightness. With the Aero 13 I would imagine that I could get several hours of actual work out of it on battery for the first time. This is a good indication.

HP Pavilion Aero 13: Should you buy it?

To me the Aero 13 is the kind of notebook I would personally want to buy. It’s small lightweight and reliable enough to be my personal computer. It isn’t a cheap notebook and costs Rs 79999. That said this is a powerful machine that will easily handle most tasks with ease. Not to forget the Aero 13 is a mainstream notebook aimed at average users.",https://news.google.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?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,HP Police Constable Recruitment 2021: Vacancies for over 1334 posts check eligibility selection process,"HP Police Constable Recruitment 2021: Vacancies for over 1334 posts check eligibility selection process other details

In 1984 Saunders made her start as a teller at the now-closed Equitable Savings while she worked toward her political science degree from Ohio State University. She didn’t expect to fall in love with banking she says and to her father’s surprise she would not go on to become the first woman attorney general (she has no hard feelings toward Janet Reno though).

Saunders knew she had a love for talking with people and listening but she didn’t fully understand the potential those values had in banking until she traveled to Chicago for her work with Household Bank.

“Being in a position where you could help people really meet their financial goals and dreams was something that really excited me” Saunders says.

Saunders went on to work at Huntington Bank for nearly a decade and PNC Bank where she served as senior vice president before becoming FCBank’s third president four years ago.

With headquarters in Worthington FCBank is a division of Clearfield Pennsylvania-based CNB Bank and has six locations in the Columbus region.

Under Saunders’ leadership some big changes have come to pass. Most recently FCBank’s Grandview Heights-area branch celebrated its grand reopening just a year after its grand opening in August 2020. Due to COVID-19 the bank’s lobbies have remained closed until recently.

The West Fifth Avenue branch is unique for its “Smart Financial Center” model Saunders says. Instead of the standard teller lines it features round tables and chairs a “living room” with a couch and various areas to sit and talk. The focus is on interpersonal communication and relationship-building not just a transaction.

Also included is the enhanced teller machine or ETM which allows customers to talk with a banker through an interactive video before during and after traditional banking hours. The Grandview model is replicated in the bank’s Bucyrus branch and one day will be in all its locations Saunders says.

FCBank plans to open a seventh branch in Westerville in 2022 in the former Flowerama space on South State Street marking the bank’s third branch with the new design.

Saunders and her team are also working on a mobile banking model which will allow FCBank to travel to underbanked areas and a “Fresh Start” checking account designed to help those with low to moderate incomes.

“We are committed to those communities both from a financial perspective and a time perspective” Saunders says.

Out since Aug. 12 because of a lower leg injury Autman-Bell looked much more active than he did on Sept. 2 when he missed the season opener against Ohio State.

He also went through the full-pad warmups but when the Gophers came out to start the game Autman-Bell again was on the sideline in a jersey and sweatpants missing his second game in a row as the Gophers beat the RedHawks 31-26.

""We've just got to get healthy'' said Gophers coach P.J. Fleck whose team plays Colorado on Saturday in Boulder. ""I'm not in charge of bringing them back. Hopefully day-to-day becomes now he's back where we can get 'Crab' back.''

Autman-Bell's absence saw the further development of wide receivers Dylan Wright and Daniel Jackson. Wright a sophomore transfer from Texas A&M caught three passes for 73 yards including a 25-yard TD grab as the Gophers took a 21-3 halftime lead. He also drew 30 yards in pass interference penalties against Miami. Jackson a sophomore caught four passes for 30 yards including a 6-yard TD reception.

""I thought Daniel played really well today'' Fleck said. ""… I liked the receiving corps. We have to continue to build ourselves mentally and build that mental toughness.''

Wright left the game in the third quarter after taking a hit on a slant pattern. He went to the medical tent returned to the sideline but did not re-enter the game as the Gophers focused on the run in the fourth quarter.

""You have to be able to fail to grow. What I saw from Dylan was big plays then he failed'' Fleck said. ""The response has to be better.'' Fleck did not have an update on Wright's condition.

On defense safety Jordan Howden (thigh) did not play. Fleck had expressed optimism leading up to the game that Howden would play.

Costly penalty for Miami

Miami cut Minnesota's lead to 21-19 early in the fourth quarter on Brett Gabbert's 23-yard TD pass to Jack Sorenson. The RedHawks were planning to try a two-point conversion that could have tied the score but they were called for their second sideline infraction following the touchdown. That moved the try back 5 yards to the 8 and coach Chuck Martin opted to kick the extra point which made it 21-20.

Nonconference win streak reaches 20

With the win over the RedHawks the Gophers extended their winning streak against nonconference opponents to 20 games the longest active streak in FBS. Their last loss in a nonconference game came Sept. 3 2015 with a 23-17 setback to No. 2 TCU in the season opener in Minneapolis.

Since the TCU loss the Gophers have six wins over Mid-American Conference opponents four over Mountain West foes three over Pac-12 teams two over FCS-level squads and one each against independents and teams from the ACC SEC Conference USA and Sun Belt. Four of the wins came in bowl games.

Etc.

You would agree that over the last 12-18 months the way you run your business and manage your teams has changed.

Perhaps forever!

More workloads are on the cloud. More customers are engaging in digital transactions expecting smooth but also secure online experiences. More regulatory compliance requirements – getting more stringent. More contractors suppliers partners and employees working remotely.

This means the attack surface has expanded as your data your applications and your users are everywhere rendering the traditional perimeter-based approach to security ineffective.

There has been a continuous increase in the scale and complexity of attacks on enterprises. The average number of days to identify and contain an attack has increased more than 10% in the last 4 years to 320 days.

The need of the hour is to strengthen your incident readiness and response with intelligent threat detection and faster response times.

As a result organizations are seriously contemplating the adoption of security frameworks like Zero Trust that can increase the chances of preventing a breach and more importantly minimize the impact if an organization is breached. New because even as the concept has been around for over a decade its implementation up until now was limited.

Additionally organizations need to reimagine security to confidently move to hybrid multicloud leveraging a modern open and unified approach to detect investigate and respond to threats faster.

Making this more challenging is the effort to recruit and retain the best cybersecurity professionals. In fact Frost & Sullivan predicts that the widening gap between available qualified cybersecurity professionals and unfulfilled positions will reach 1.8 million by 2022.

So what does mean for you the CISO?

You need to proactively manage and respond to security threats address the security skills shortages and enable a secure migration of workloads to the cloud.

This is especially difficult when covering the digital tech industry because one is continually deluged with ‘new’ stuff – viral memes shiny new products or services Facebook scandals (a weekly staple) security breaches etc. Recent weeks for example have brought the industry’s enthusiasm for the idea of a “metaverse” (neatly dissected here by Alex Hern) El Salvador’s flirtation with bitcoin endless stories about central banks and governments beginning to worry about regulating cryptocurrencies Apple’s possible rethink of its plans to scan phones and iCloud accounts for child abuse images umpteen ransomware attacks antitrust suits against app stores the Theranos trial and so on apparently ad infinitum.

So how to break out of the fruitless syndrome identified by Prof Mann? One way is to borrow an idea from Ben Thompson a veteran tech commentator who doesn’t suffer from it and whose (paid) newsletter should be a mandatory daily email for any serious observer of the tech industry. Way back in 2014 he suggested that we think of the industry in terms of “epochs” – important periods or eras in the history of a field. At that point he saw three epochs in the evolution of our networked world each defined in terms of its core technology and its “killer app”.

Epoch one in this framework was the PC era opened in August 1981 when IBM launched its personal computer. The core technology was the machine’s open architecture and the MS-DOS (later Windows) operating system. And the killer app was the spreadsheet (which ironically had actually been pioneered – as VisiCalc – on the Apple II).

The metaverse is a vision of an immersive environment to keep wealthy humans amused in their air-conditioned caves while the planet cooks

Epoch two was the internet era which began 14 years after the PC epoch began with the Netscape IPO in August 1995. The core technology (the “operating system” if you like) was the web browser – the tool that turned the internet into something that non-geeks could understand and use – and the epoch was initially characterised by a vicious struggle to control the browser a battle in which Microsoft destroyed Netscape and captured 90% of the market but eventually wound up facing an antitrust suit that nearly led to its breakup. In this epoch search was the killer app and in the end the dominant use came to be social networking with the dominant market share being captured by Facebook.

Epoch three in Thompson’s framework – the era we’re in now – was the mobile one. It dates from January 2007 when Apple announced the iPhone and launched the smartphone revolution. Unlike the two earlier eras there’s no single dominant operating system: instead there’s a duopoly between Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android system. The killer app is the so-called “sharing economy” (which of course is nothing of the kind) and messaging of various kinds has become the dominant communications medium. And now it looks as though this smartphone epoch is reaching its peak.

If that is indeed what’s happening the obvious question is: what comes next? What will the fourth epoch be like? And here it’s worth borrowing an idea from another perceptive observer of these things the novelist William Gibson who observed that “the future is already here; it’s just not evenly distributed”. If that’s as profound as I think it is then what we should be looking out for are things that keep bubbling up in disjointed and apparently unconnected ways like hot lava spurts in Iceland or other geologically unstable regions.

So what can we see bubbling up in techland at the moment? If you believe the industry metaverses (plural) – basically conceived as massive virtual-reality environments – might be a big thing. That looks to this observer like wishful thinking for psychotics. At any rate at its extreme end the metaverse idea is a vision of an immersive video-game-like environment to keep wealthy humans amused in their air-conditioned caves while the planet cooks and less fortunate humans have trouble breathing. In that sense the metaverse might just be a way of avoiding unpleasant realities. (But then as a prominent Silicon Valley figure recently joked maybe reality is overrated anyway.)

Two more plausible candidates for what will power future epochs are cryptography – in the sense of blockchain technology – and quantum computing. But an era in which these are dominant technologies would embody an intriguing contradiction: our current crypto tools depend on creating keys that would take conventional computers millions of years to crack. Quantum computers though would crack them in nanoseconds. In which case we might finally have to concede that as a species we’re too smart for our own good.

For those wondering they are using SiaaS instead of SaaS but it is close here. Still Lenovo as part of its expanded TruScale (not TrueNAS Scale) has a very interesting feature: it can increase the number of cores in your machine without having to swap in new processors.

Lenovo TruScale Enables Silicon-as-a-Service by Intel

For those who are unaware Lenovo TruScale utilizes the power consumed by a server as a proxy for the consumption of that server. Lenovo’s reason is clear: it can meter the power at the power supplies or the PDU without having to install a management service and use resources of the server itself for metering. Intel was convinced that this is an acceptable proxy and agreed to enable CPU cores as a service with Lenovo’s power monitoring serving as a consumption proxy.

STH asked whether Lenovo is utilizing Intel Speed Select Technology or Intel SST here. Intel has a specific SST-PP feature with some of its processors to dynamically tune core counts frequency and TDP.

Even after a follow-up Lenovo was unable to confirm how they were accomplishing this task. This may not be what Lenovo TruScale SiaaS is using but Lenovo has a capability using Intel chips. Those Intel chips have a seemingly matching capability. So we are going to put those slides on a page and let our readers decide.

Final Words

Overall this is a very interesting model. The advantage is that Lenovo and Intel can deploy a single higher-volume configuration and then adjust the core counts and TDP according to needs increasing them without having to pull a server out of a rack. For Intel this means they are selling higher core count chips into this ecosystem in the hope that at some point those extra cores get used. We wish we had a confirmation that Lenovo is using SST but the company’s representatives were unable to confirm even after a follow-up to STH.

Lenovo also discussed that it is bringing new TruScale capabilities and models this week. For example it will bring VMware Edge Cloud and Microsoft to its offering and integrate them with its management features. It announced a partnership with Deloitte where Deloitte can resell TruScale offerings. STH asked whether there was a partnership with a major data center provider to just offer fully managed offerings like Dell Apex and HPE GreenLake are doing by colocating managed hardware with providers like Equinix. Lenovo told STH that they do not have this offering at this time.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilQFodHRwczovL3djY2Z0ZWNoLmNvbS9pbnRlbC1hcmMtYWxjaGVtaXN0LWRlc2t0b3AtZ3JhcGhpY3MtY2FyZHMtdG8tY29tcGV0ZS13aXRoLWFtZC1yeC02NzAwLXh0LW52aWRpYS1ydHgtMzA3MC1wcmljaW5nLXN0YXJ0cy1hdC0xMDAtdXMtdXAtdG8tNTAwLXVzL9IBmQFodHRwczovL3djY2Z0ZWNoLmNvbS9pbnRlbC1hcmMtYWxjaGVtaXN0LWRlc2t0b3AtZ3JhcGhpY3MtY2FyZHMtdG8tY29tcGV0ZS13aXRoLWFtZC1yeC02NzAwLXh0LW52aWRpYS1ydHgtMzA3MC1wcmljaW5nLXN0YXJ0cy1hdC0xMDAtdXMtdXAtdG8tNTAwLXVzL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel ARC Alchemist Desktop Graphics Cards To Compete With AMD RX 6700 XT & NVIDIA RTX 3070 Pricing Starts at $100 US & Up To $500 US,"Intel ARC Alchemist graphics card performance and price positioning slide has leaked out showing the NVIDIA and AMD GPUs the lineup will be competing against.

According to the slide the lineup will include at least four SKUs but there may be more. Also the slide looks to be a little old since it doesn't mention the ARC branding that Intel just recently introduced for its graphics lineup so internal plans might have changed since then.

Intel's High-End ARC Gaming Graphics Card Lineup ($300 - $500 US)

With that said let's talk about the upper echelon of the lineup which will feature Enthusiast ($400 - $499 US) and Performance+ ($300 - $399 US) graphics cards. These Intel ARC Alchemist GPUs will feature the 'SOC1' which could be the internal codename for the Alchemist 512 EU chip. This chip has a TDP range of 175W to 225W. The Enthusiast part will tackle the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 & the AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT.

Do note that Intel doesn't plan to launch an 'Enthusiast+' contender in its first-gen ARC lineup as that will be reserved for the next-gen. This means that the top graphics cards from NVIDIA & AMD such as the GeForce RTX 3080 and the Radeon RX 6800 XT will remain uncontested.

Intel's Entry-Level ARC Gaming Graphics Card Lineup ($100 - $200 US)

Moving on to the lower-end segment this is one place where Intel may hit AMD and NVIDIA hard considering both GPU manufacturers haven't released a single sub-$300 US desktop graphics card in the market yet. The mainstream segment will feature the 'SOC2' which is the Alchemist 128 EU GPU and will feature a TDP of 75W and up. ARC graphics cards based on this chip will be featured in the 'Mainstream+' ($150 - $199 US) and 'Mainstream' ($100 - $149 US) segment.

Both AMD and NVIDIA do have the chips to launch in the entry-level segment but they are being pushed to notebooks and laptops first. If launched prior to Q1 2022 then entry-level ARC GPUs will tackle AMD's Navi 24 (RX 6500 Series) and NVIDIA's GA107 GPUs (RTX 3050 Series) though those may end up over $200 US pricing considering where the mainstream cards are currently featured.

A major lead that Intel could have over the competition especially NVIDIA since AMD lacks in this department is AI assistance in supersampling technologies. Intel has already showcased an impressive demo of its XeSS technology and based on the expected numbers Intel GPUs could outperform NVIDIA's Tensor Core implementation (DLSS) with its XMX architecture. Intel is also expected to feature a small but useful game cache on its GPUs and will be equipped with higher VRAM capacities of up to 16 GB (GDDR6) across a 256-bit bus interface. This would be twice as much memory as NVIDIA's RTX 3070 and RTX 3070 Ti so they may have to prepare a refresh to counter it.

We have seen the Intel Xe-HPG Alchemist GPU-based discrete graphics card engineering sample leak out a few months back along with some rumored performance and pricing figures you can read more on that here. Based on the timeline the Xe-HPG Alchemist lineup will compete against NVIDIA's Ampere & AMD RDNA 2 GPUs since both companies aren't expected to launch their next-gen parts by the very end of 2022. The Xe-HPG ARC GPUs will be coming to the mobility platform too and will be featured in Alder Lake-P notebooks.

As we’ll see below the mini PC’s specifications are similar to the ones for the SBC’s but the advantage here is that you’ll get an enclosure a power supply and an HDMI cable plus the usual mostly useless user manual and warranty card.

T7 II mini PC specifications:

SoC – Intel Atom x5-Z8350 “Cherry Trail” quad-core processor @ 1.44 GHz / 1.92 GHz (Burst frequency) with Intel HD 400 graphics @ 200 / 500 MHz

System Memory – 2 GB DDR3L

Storage – 32 GB eMMC flash full-size SD card socket

Video Output – HDMI 1.4 port up to 4Kp30 1080p60

Audio – 3.5mm audio (mic+headphone) jack and digital audio via HDMI

Connectivity Gigabit Ethernet 802.11 b/g/n WiFi 4 @ 2.4 GHz Bluetooth 4.0

USB – 1x USB 3.0 host port 2x USB 2.0 ports

Misc – Power button “RTC” button (it must be the pinhole for CMOS reset just right to the audio jack)

Power Supply – 12V/1.5A via power barrel

Dimensions – 121 x 121 x 27 mm

It is said to ship with an activated version of Windows 10. Now it would probably amount to torture for somebody to use this device as an actual mini PC but it might be quite useful for specific tasks like a Linux-based automation gateway a simple digital signage player or even maybe as a Linux-based Kodi player with images like LibrELEC or CoreELEC. That’s provided you don’t need recent features like HDR and mostly play to play Full HD videos. Intel Atom x5-Z8350 supports H.265 hardware video decoding so most 4K videos up to 30 fps should play smoothly in Kodi but VP9 is not supported and playing YouTube videos in a web browser should be limited to 720p due to the amount of skipped and dropped frames with higher resolutions.

For some benchmark numbers and more general impressions you can check out our review of Tronsmart Ara x5 mini PC with similar specifications. T7 II mini PC looks like a good deal for under $90 as long as you know what to expect.

Unlike AMD which occasionally faces criticism for not including coolers with some models Intel is thanked for sparing the metal. And that's because the few coolers they do ship are barely functional.

Intel's Rocket Lake cooler pictured above has existed in various iterations for about a decade. Intel has occasionally varied the color and made it a bit taller to perform a little better or a smidgen wider to be a fraction quieter but it's never been more than just adequate.

But now perhaps to strike against AMD Intel is reportedly experimenting with new designs that could be bundled with Alder Lake (12th-gen Core) processors this year. Three of their early prototypes are pictured in a leaked slide below.

The series is called Laminar. On the left is the RH1 which has been designed to cool i9 processors (and look cool doing it). It's quite tall although the visible fins aren't very dense. It has a considerable amount of RGB and premium-material accents.

In the middle and on the right are the RM1 and RS1 which look like the same part with an RGB ring tacked onto the former although the RS1 could also be gimped with an aluminum core. The RM1 is for i7 i5 and i3 parts while the RS1 is for Pentium and Celeron models.

The slide suggests that all three have a 65 W cooling capacity which seems like a bit of a mismatch to the products they cool but a good match with their abilities.

Read this: Intel Box Cooler vs. AMD Wraith Series

Compared to the competition the RH1 looks like it's equivalent to the AMD Wraith Spire while the RM1 and RS1 look comparable to the Wraith Stealth. But like the Wraith coolers the Laminar coolers are likely going to struggle to compete with $20-30 aftermarket coolers.

Despite their limited usefulness stock coolers should generally be included with budget and midrange CPUs and Intel will get a thumbs up from us if decent Laminar coolers are bundled with Alder Lake."

Oregon coffee chain Dutch Bros set Sept. 15 date for IPO may be Oregon's largest,"Mike Rogoway

The Oregonian/OregonLive

Southern Oregon drive-thru coffee chain Dutch Bros has set Wednesday Sept. 15 as the date for its initial public offering when company shares will begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “BROS.”

It figures to be the biggest IPO in Oregon history raising up to $484 million. The chain based in Grants Pass plans to use $200 million of the proceeds to pay down debt and will use other funds to buy back stock and grow the business. Dutch Bros said it will donate 1% of the IPO’s proceeds to charity over the next 10 years.

Founded in 1992 the company has grown from a single coffee pushcart to more than 480 stores across the West. Dutch Bros said in filings associated with its IPO that it hopes someday to have 4000 shops.

Beyond simple Americanos Dutch Bros features an array of frothy beverages cold brews and energy drinks. The company said in its regulatory filings that its Blue Rebel energy drinks accounted for nearly a quarter of its sales last year.

Dutch Bros said it plans to sell shares for between $18 and $20 apiece. It plans to price the shares on Tuesday night according to the New York Stock Exchange’s public calendar.

At the top end of the price range the business would be worth $3.3 billion and would be Oregon’s seventh-most-valuable public company.

Co-founder Travis Boersma Dutch Bros’ executive chairman would own 43% of its stock after the IPO — worth as much as $1.4 billion.

In filings the company outlined an unusual stock structure that would give Boersma 74% of the company’s voting power. The company’s charter also contains provisions that would make it difficult for an outside firm to mount a hostile takeover.

Such provisions might give investors pause. And newly public companies sometime struggle as they adapt to the public markets and Wall Street’s expectations.

Dutch Bros has been growing rapidly with sales climbing 27% last year to $327.4 million. Sales were up 51% through the first six months of 2021.

Profits fell sharply last year though from $28.4 million in 2019 to $5.8 million in 2020. Financial filings indicate Dutch Bros’ spending to operate and run the business jumped enormously last year amid the tremendous expansion.",,,,,,,,,

A day after the horrors of that crystalline blue Tuesday morning 20 years ago I like so many carefully preserved a copy of The New York Times dated Sept. 12 2001 with its screaming banner headline stretched across the top:

U.S. ATTACKED

But I hadn’t given any thought to the paper of the day before until this July when a fellow teacher Rob Spurrier walked into my summer journalism classroom at Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire and handed me his yellowing copy. With a big anniversary of 9/11 approaching he said “Here’s your story.”

I scanned the front page of that Sept. 11 2001 national edition of the paper with its comfortingly single-column headlines like:

KEY LEADERS TALK

OF POSSIBLE DEALS

TO REVIVE ECONOMY

On the top left was a big photo of an orange tent in Bryant Park for Fashion Week. Under it was the cable and network scramble for morning television watchers. Below the fold was a tizzy over school dress codes — what a reporter called “the tumult of bare skin.”

I saw my friend’s point.

The 34-year-old departed the Emirates in July after the club decided not to extend his contract as they were keen to get his £100000-a-week salary off their wage bill.

Luiz has been a free agent all summer and reportedly turned down moves to Marseille and Italian top-flight team Salernitana with the centre back in favour of a return to his native Brazil.

David Luiz has signed a deal until December 2022 with Brazilian top-flight side Flamengo

The 34-year-old has been a free agent since leaving Premier League club Arsenal in July

T he Brazilian international paper signed a Flamengo contract until December 2022 on Friday night following meetings with his agent Julio Taran and the Brazilian club's hierarchy.

Luiz would be the third former Premier League player to make the move to Flamengo this summer with the Brazilian outfit snapping up Manchester United's Andreas Pereira and Chelsea's Kenedy on loan deals from the English clubs.

The defender has not played in his home country since leaving Vitoria for Benfica on an initial loan deal in 2007 before making the move permanent that year.

French news outlet Le 10 Sport claimed Luiz said no to two offers from Marseille and Salernitana as he is intent on returning home.

A Flamengo move (above) sees Luiz return to Brazil club level for the first time since 2007

Marseille tried all summer to lure the player to the Stade Velodrome with coach Jorge Sampaoli and president Pablo Longoria heavily involved in talks the report claims.

Having failed initially the report adds the French outfit returned to the table to convince him further and while Luiz listened to the proposal he still could not be swayed.

Newly promoted Serie A outfit Salernitana are also said to have tried their luck - hoping their high profile arrival Franck Ribery might help persuade Luiz to make the move - but he turned down their advances too.

Flamengo had emerged as the leading contenders to snap up the free agent and in August it was reported the Brazilian outfit were 'optimistic' they could pull off a deal.

Marseille boss Jorge Sampaoli is said to have been chasing him all summer but was rejected

The 34-year-old is said to have previously met with Flamengo's vice president Marcos Braz and football director Bruno Spindel with the Brazilian club pair said to be on a mission to bring in high-profile players.

At club level Luiz has a CV to envy with a host of trophy wins to boast - including the Champions League the Europa League the Premier League title and the FA Cup - plus a clean sweep of silverware in France.

He made his name with Chelsea - signing from Benfica in 2010 - and going on to make 143 appearances before joining PSG for two seasons.

Luiz then returned to Stamford Bridge for a further three years before moving to rivals Arsenal for an £8million fee. He played 73 times for the Gunners winning the FA Cup in 2019-20.",,,

The canine machine made by DeepRobotics can detect its own posture in real time to remain flexible and stable the company's marketing manager said.

'Its biggest advantage is that it can replace humans to complete some tasks in complex and dangerous scenarios' they added.

'For example it can adapt to terrains such as stairs slopes gravel roads and grass.'

There's also what's referred to as a nursing robot – a mechanised wheelchair that can take someone to a bathtub or toilet then back to bed all on its own.

Its founder sees China with its large elderly population as the biggest market for this type of AI.

They said: 'Most young people today are unwilling to engage in this job.

'Therefore there is a huge gap in the workers who can take care of disabled elderly people and this gap has brought great problems to the country and society.'

Original erectile dysfunction treatments showed poor sales performance compared to generic products in the second quarter.

According to data from IQVIA the size of the oral erectile dysfunction drug market in the second quarter was 29.5 billion won ($25.2 million) up 4.8 percent from the same period last year.

The erectile dysfunction treatment market which had shown a downward trend in the first and second quarters of last year due to the decrease in patient's hospital visits due to the Covid-19 outbreak has been gradually increasing since the second half of last year.

During this time generic products released by local pharmaceutical companies are expanding their influence. For example Hanmi Pharmaceutical's Viagra copy Palpal released right after the Viagra patent expired in 2012 has not lost its lead in the erectile dysfunction treatment market for six years after surpassing Viagra in the second quarter of 2013 and Cialis in the fourth quarter of 2015.

During the second quarter Palpal maintained its leading position with sales of 5 billion won. Although it decreased 4.4 percent from the same period of the previous year it far outpaced Chong Kun Dang's Cialis generic Cendom the runner-up in the local erectile dysfunction market by more than 2 billion won.

Chong Kun Dang's Cialis generic Cendom also maintained its second place after recording 2.7 billion won in sales in the second quarter up 5.6 percent from the previous year.

The drug released after the Cialis patent expired in Sep. 2015 gradually expanded its market share and overtook the original product Cialis in the fourth quarter of 2017 and overtook Viagra in the fourth quarter of 2018 to occupy the second place overall.

The two products have enjoyed popularity among local patients particularly due to their lower price than originals.

Hanmi Pharm's Cialis generic Gugu ranked third overall for the first time after surpassing sales of Viagra and Cialis. Gugu's sales in the second quarter were 2.2 billion won up 9.5 percent from the same period last year. Gugu overtook Cialis in the second quarter of 2019 and surpassed Viagra for the first time.

In comparison original drugs from multinational pharmaceutical companies remained mired in a deep slump.

Viatris Korea's Viagra once heralded as the king of erectile dysfunction treatment ranked fourth by recording 2.1 billion won in sales in the second quarter up 1 percent from the previous year. This was the first time that Viagra had fallen to fourth place in the erectile dysfunction treatment market.

Viagra has steadily lost its market share after losing the lead in 2013 to Palpal and second place to Cendom in 2018. Compared to its heyday Viagra's sales have almost halved.

Lilly's Cialis also recorded 1.5 billion won in sales in the second quarter down 6.5 percent from the previous year.

The decrease in sales comes even though Lilly signed a contract with Handok a former sales partner letting the latter take charge of domestic distribution marketing and sales activities of Cialis in 2018.

Despite the contract the company has seen no rebounds so far.

The success of generic drugs is noteworthy as it is rare for generic products to exceed sales of original medicines due to the reliability that original products have built over a long period.

Market watchers attributed the success of erectile dysfunction generic treatments to the lack of insurance coverage of the treatment.

""In the non-reimbursable drug market where the suppliers determine the price generic drugs have been aggressively expanding market share by marketing their drugs at a much lower price than original drugs"" an industry expert said. ""At least in the Korean market generic drugs have overwhelmed the originals as generics were able to grow due to low prices which gave easier access to consumers.""",,,,,,,,,

For readers new to town (or with short memories) Beckie Jacobs opened Serendipity Homemade Ice Cream in a charming Webster Groves storefront (8130 Big Bend) in 2003. Eighteen years later she’s finally opening store No. 2.

“I’ve looked into expanding on and off over the years” she says “and The Grove has continued to grow and expand too especially now with all the new housing being built and the lack of an ice cream shop in the area.""

“I have to admit the Gills [landlords and partners Amy and Amrit Gill [of Restoration St. Louis] made the decision for me” she adds. “I never had such a great opportunity before.”

The new location is a 2000-square-foot corner space on the ground floor of Gateway Lofts a mixed-use 60-unit apartment project developed by the Gills at 4400 Manchester (at Newstead).

The Grove location allows for more ice cream production space an additional dip cabinet and expanded hours. ""We were maxed out in Webster so we can now move the production space to The Grove"" she says ""which will allow us to pursue more off-premise accounts some of which we lost during the pandemic.""

Since the demographic is different in The Grove the business model will shift accordingly. ""We're more in an entertainment district now with housing all around us"" she explains.

Part of the plan is to roll out a ""coffee-to-cocktails"" program which means opening earlier in the day (for coffee and light pastries) and staying open later at night (with a ""small but mighty"" cocktail list and more dessert offerings). ""There are times you just want something close to home at the beginning or end of the day"" she says. The decor will also be ""something befitting the neighborhood"" she says.

Over the years Serendipity in Webster Groves has become known for its variety of homemade ice cream flavors sundaes toppings shakes malts floats as well as more esoteric options such as bite-size bon bons spirited (boozy) shakes and ice cream novelties (think Waffle Nachos Dipstix and Dipity Dough create-your-own ice cream sandwiches cradled by a cookie brownie or glazed donut).

Local restaurants also took notice over time. “When chefs like Vince Bommarito of Tony’s and people that I really think hung the moon started calling me to put my ice cream on their menus that’s when I knew I was doing good things” Jacobs told SLM in 2011. Restaurant requests for exotic flavors followed which Jacobs called “Leap of Faith” flavors inside Serendipity.

She was an early supporter of National Ice Cream for Breakfast Day often creating breakfast-themed flavors—Maple Bacon Crunch Saturday Morning Cartoons and French Toast Crunch for example—for the occasion. Guests arriving in their jammies received a Serendipity mug filled with coffee tea hot cocoa…or an alcoholic beverage (Irish coffee anyone?) for an additional charge.

Expand Courtesy Serendipity

In 2016 Serendipity acquired the Fire & Ice Cream food truck (a vintage 1946 Ford fire truck) which makes appearances at 9 Mile Garden and Food Truck Fridays in Tower Grove Park and can be rented for private corporate and personal events.

Jacobs continues to remain active in the community having organized fundraisers for the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society the Girl Scouts of Eastern Missouri and most recently local charities Pedal the Cause and Gateway to Hope.

This month Jacobs will be riding on Teri Griege 's Powered by Hope bicycling team to help find a cure for cancer and Serendipity customers can participate in the effort. For every sundae sold in September Jacobs will donate $1–$2 to Pedal the Cause; for every specialty shake sold in October $1 will be donated to Gateway To Hope.

South Africa’s opposition Democratic Alliance (DA) has filed papers in the Pretoria High Court seeking to overturn the medical parole issued to former president Jacob Zuma who is serving a 15-month sentence for contempt of court.

Former South African president Jacob Zuma in July 2021 at his home in KwaZulu-Natal province.

The party wants the head of Correctional Services Arthur Fraser – a strong ally of Zuma – to explain why he rescinded the medical parole board’s decision not to free the former president after he had served 58 days of his sentence.

Zuma’s corruption trial which due to resume last Friday has been postponed until September 21.

He is due to appear in person then at the Pietermaritzburg High Court and to supply medical evidence if he seeks a further delay.

Zuma was still in hospital five days after being paroled.

DA leader John Steenhuisen says their application to have the parole overturned goes beyond Zuma.

The party is hoping that the report of the Zondo Commission on State capture will result in a number of ANC cadres being jailed.

It was Zuma’s refusal to appear before this commission that led to him being jailed for contempt of court.

No 'get out of jail free' cards

“We don’t want the ANC ready to hand 'get out of jail free' cards to ensure their people don’t face the sentences they deserve for the pain and suffering and the damage they have inflicted on the body politic” said Steenhuisen.

In seeking Fraser’s appearance before the parliamentary committee the DA said it was not seeking to invade Zuma’s right to privacy about his medical condition.

“We want a record of Fraser’s decision and the process in making it” Steenhuisen said

“If he exercises a public power he must explain what warranted overturning the finding of the medical parole board.

“He is not a doctor and the board is specially qualified to make medical decisions.”

Medical parole board

The medical parole board was instituted to prevent a repeat of the 2009 fiasco when Zuma’s financial advisor Schabir Shaik was freed on medical grounds after serving two years and four months of a 15-year sentence for fraud involving funds from South Africa’s multibillion rand arms procurement operation.

Shaik was photographed playing golf shortly after being free

Zuma’s corruption trial involves 16 counts of fraud money laundering and embezzlement of the the same arms procurement funds.

Before that trial proceeds Judge Koen has to deal with Zuma’s plea for the public prosecutor Bill Downer to recuse himself.

Zuma alleges Downer is biased and hell bent on getting him convicted.

Legal analysts say South Africa’s confrontational legal system obliges Downer to make every effort to win a conviction.

""Jimmy Johnson was extraordinarily athletically talented"" Hall of Fame President Jim Porter said in Thursday's statement. ""The 49ers enjoyed the luxury of using him on offense and defense early in his career to fill team needs. Once he settled in at left cornerback he flourished. The notion that a 'lockdown' cornerback could cut the field in half for the opposition was true with Jimmy. Only rarely would other teams' quarterbacks even look in his direction and more often than not regretted the decision if they challenged him.""

The 49ers organization also expressed its condolences in a social media post.

And the team released a statement marking his passing.

""The 49ers family is deeply saddened by the passing of one of the NFL's all-time greats Jimmy Johnson. Jimmy embodied the essence of what it meant to be a 49er"" the team statement said. ""He was the ultimate gentleman and will be remembered for his humility kindness and loveable demeanor. We send our condolences to his wife Gisela and his entire family at this difficult time.""

While Johnson displayed prowess on both sides of the ball boasting - 47 career interceptions in 213 games with 615 return yards he also hauled in 40 receptions for 690 yards and four touchdowns in two seasons as a wide receiver.

One of the greatest players in 49ers' history especially on the defensive side of the ball Johnson was among the original ""shutdown"" cornerbacks in football. Former 49ers quarterback John Brodie once said that veteran quarterbacks didn't throw Johnson's way because of the fear of being intercepted.

""Jim doesn't receive much publicity because the opposition avoids him as much as possible"" Brodie said back when they were teammates via the Pro Football Hall of Fame website. ""Talk to veteran quarterbacks like John Unitas and Bart Starr and they'll tell you they call a few pass patterns in Jimmy's area.

""The only reason Johnson doesn't lead the league in interceptions is he doesn't get the chance.""

When Johnson retired following his 1976 campaign no NFL player had turned in more seasons at defensive back than he had. At that time Johnson's 201 games and 198 starts were each the most for a DB in league history.

His interceptions and INT return yards remain second in 49ers history behind only fellow Hall of Famer Ronnie Lott (51 interceptions 643 yards) the Hall of Fame said.

Jimmy Johnson born James Earl played his college football at UCLA but was also a great track athlete away from the football field but his brother was even better. Radar won a gold medal in the decathlon in the 1960 Summer Olympics.

""Jimmy"" Johnson played college ball at UCLA. But Johnson wasn't just a football standout for the Bruins -- he was also exceptional on the track though not quite as good as his brother. Jimmy Johnson won All-American honors and an NCAA 100-meter championship while his brother Rafer garnered a gold medal in the decathlon at the 1960 Summer Olympics.

Jimmy Johnson was the 6th overall pick in the 1961 NFL Draft and made his presence felt right away in his rookie year with 5 catches in his first dozen games. He achieved Pro Bowl status from 1969 to 1972.

Johnson died Wednesday evening the Hall of Fame and 49ers announced.

""Jimmy Johnson was extraordinarily athletically talented"" Hall of Fame President Jim Porter said in Thursday's statement. ""The 49ers enjoyed the luxury of using him on offense and defense early in his career to fill team needs. Once he settled in at left cornerback he flourished. The notion that a 'lockdown' cornerback could cut the field in half for the opposition was true with Jimmy. Only rarely would other teams' quarterbacks even look in his direction and more often than not regretted the decision if they challenged him.""

The 49ers organization also expressed its condolences in a social media post.

And the team released a statement marking his passing.

""The 49ers family is deeply saddened by the passing of one of the NFL's all-time greats Jimmy Johnson. Jimmy embodied the essence of what it meant to be a 49er"" the team statement said. ""He was the ultimate gentleman and will be remembered for his humility kindness and loveable demeanor. We send our condolences to his wife Gisela and his entire family at this difficult time.""

While Johnson displayed prowess on both sides of the ball boasting - 47 career interceptions in 213 games with 615 return yards he also hauled in 40 receptions for 690 yards and four touchdowns in two seasons as a wide receiver.

One of the greatest players in 49ers' history especially on the defensive side of the ball Johnson was among the original ""shutdown"" cornerbacks in football. Former 49ers quarterback John Brodie once said that veteran quarterbacks didn't throw Johnson's way because of the fear of being intercepted.

""Jim doesn't receive much publicity because the opposition avoids him as much as possible"" Brodie said back when they were teammates via the Pro Football Hall of Fame website. ""Talk to veteran quarterbacks like John Unitas and Bart Starr and they'll tell you they call a few pass patterns in Jimmy's area.

""The only reason Johnson doesn't lead the league in interceptions is he doesn't get the chance.""

When Johnson retired following his 1976 campaign no NFL player had turned in more seasons at defensive back than he had. At that time Johnson's 201 games and 198 starts were each the most for a DB in league history.

His interceptions and INT return yards remain second in 49ers history behind only fellow Hall of Famer Ronnie Lott (51 interceptions 643 yards) the Hall of Fame said.

Jimmy Johnson born James Earl played his college football at UCLA but was also a great track athlete away from the football field but his brother was even better. Radar won a gold medal in the decathlon in the 1960 Summer Olympics.

An Arizona woman accused of attempting to kill her husband by poisoning his coffee has been sentenced to three years probation.

Melody Felicano Johnson was initially charged with attempted first-degree murder and pleaded guilty to two counts of the lesser felony charge of adding poison or a harmful substance to food or drink in April.

Johnson could have faced a maximum of 2 years in prison for each count.

Her attorney requested the sentence be time served saying Johnson had already been in custody for nearly a year due to her inability to post a $250000 bond. Her sentence also included mental health treatment.

Judge Javier Chon-Lopez noted even the victim her estranged husband Roby Johnson had told the court he did not want Johnson to end up in prison.

The defendant’s husband told investigators he “believes she was trying to kill him to collect death benefits” according to a criminal report obtained last year by CNN affiliate KVOA. Roby Johnson said he first noticed a foul taste to his coffee in March 2023 while he was an airman stationed in Germany the document says.

The Johnsons were still living together with their child but were in the process of getting divorced. Roby and Melody Johnson’s divorce is still pending her attorney said.

Roby Johnson told detectives he used pool testing strips to determine his coffee pot “showed high levels of chlorine” and set up hidden cameras that reportedly caught Melody Johnson pouring bleach into a container and pouring the contents of that container into the coffee maker investigators said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMTEvYm9va3MvcmV2aWV3L3RoZS1pbmZlcm5hbC1tYWNoaW5lLXN0ZXBoZW4tam9obnNvbi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Book Review: ‘The Infernal Machine’ by Steven Johnson,"THE INFERNAL MACHINE: A True Story of Dynamite Terror and the Rise of the Modern Detective by Steven Johnson

The old-time image of an anarchist that has long been fixed in popular imagination is of a guy with wild hair and a deranged smile holding a circular bomb with a lit fuse. Alexander Berkman and Emma Goldman looked nothing like that. Photographs of them from more than a century ago show them to be quite proper and well dressed; they could have been any elegant couple decked out for a stroll along Fifth Avenue.

But Berkman and the better-known Goldman onetime lovers born in the Russian Empire were indeed anarchists believing in a society without leaders one rooted in an egalitarian spirit free of the top-down organization that has defined governance for oh only forever. Sure many anarchists were unruly: In their heyday roughly from 1880 to 1920 they went around blowing things up employing the dynamite invented by a Swedish gent Alfred Nobel whose name now graces the world’s most coveted peace prize.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJvc3Rvbmdsb2JlLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzEwL21ldHJvL2hhbGwtZmFtZS1kZWZlbnNpdmUtYmFjay1qaW1teS1qb2huc29uLWRlYWQtYWdlLTg2L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hall of Fame defensive back Jimmy Johnson dead at age 86,"Mr. Johnson inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1994 played his entire 16-year pro career with San Francisco. He appeared in 213 games more than any other 49ers player at the time of his retirement.

Mr. Johnson’s family told the Pro Football Hall of Fame that he died on Wednesday night at home in the San Francisco area after a lengthy illness.

Pro Football Hall of Fame defensive back Jimmy Johnson a three-time All-Pro and member of the All-Decade Team of the 1970s has died. He was 86.

The 49ers drafted Mr. Johnson sixth overall in 1961 out of UCLA — the Chargers of the upstart AFL took him in the fourth round of that league’s draft — and he became a starter almost immediately as a cornerback. He had five interceptions as a rookie.

But he was so versatile that the Niners used Mr. Johnson on offense in 1962 when he made 34 receptions for 627 yards and scored four touchdowns.

Preventing opponents from compiling such stats was his forte however and by 1964 Mr. Johnson was a fixture on the corner. He remained there until retiring after the 1976 season totaling 47 interceptions returning two for scores and earning a reputation as a stingy cover man with a nose for the ball.

“Jimmy embodied the essence of what it meant to be a 49er"" the team said in a statement. “He was the ultimate gentleman and will be remembered for his humility kindness and loveable demeanor.”

In 1971 in the midst of a three-year run as an All-Pro Mr. Johnson won the George Halas Award for courageous play.

“You have to be worked on cornered in and cornered out to become as good as you can be” Mr. Johnson said when he entered the Hall of Fame. “So actually I feel standing here today that I never reached that level I never reached as good a football player as I could be. But thanks to God and inner talent I was able to present a picture to those individuals who were voting for the Hall of Fame and my longevity and the level of game that I played from my rookie season to my last. That on this wondrous year of 1994 I’ve been given the opportunity the glorious opportunity to become a member of the most wonderful society: The National Football League Hall of Fame.”

It reached the point when Mr. Johnson was at his peak that opponents rarely threw his way. He was Deion Sanders long before “Prime Time” hit the NFL.

“Jim doesn’t receive much publicity because the opposition avoids him as much as possible” San Francisco quarterback John Brodie once said. “Talk to veteran quarterbacks like John Unitas and Bart Starr and they’ll tell you they call few pass patterns in Jimmy’s area. The only reason Johnson doesn’t lead the league in interceptions is he doesn’t get the chance.”

Former 49ers coach Dick Nolan once said Mr. Johnson was a better cornerback than two of his other players (Hall of Famer) Mel Renfro and (two-time All-Pro) Cornell Green with the Cowboys.

The brother of Olympic decathlon champion Rafer Johnson Jimmy Johnson played two ways at UCLA. He was a wingback on offense and a defensive back while also competing in track as a hurdler and broad jumper.

His brother was Mr. Johnson’s presenter for enshrinement in the Canton Ohio hall.

“Rafer Johnson is in fact my hero and that is an amazing thing in itself” Jimmy Johnson said that day. “Most young men growing up usually have a hero in another town another city another country and they will write to this individual receive an autographed photo and then tack that photo up on the wall and worship that photo play for that photo and get inspiration from that photo. No such problem for me.

“I had a brother living with me on a day-to-day basis that I was able to talk to ask the pertinent questions get the pertinent feedback and get corrected in my direction if needed. I must say I must give brother Rafer credit for everything that I have accomplished in the field of athletics. And I just wish that we could split this trophy this bust of myself right down the middle because he surely deserves half of it.”"

Erie - Stephen Peter ""Steve"" Narusewicz

Stephen Peter Narusewicz age 64 of Erie passed away at his home on Thursday September 10 2021 lovingly surrounded by his family after a short courageous battle with cancer. He was born in Erie on January 28th 1957 son of the late Leo and Florence (Stanek) Narusewicz.

Steve was a 1975 graduate of East High School and played varsity water polo. He graduated from Erie Business Center in 1983 with an Associate's Degree in Computer Systems and Management Science. He was currently employed at Composiflex in the Customer Service Department. His past employers included Uniflow Johnson Controls and Plastek.

Steve played softball as member of the Erie Codgers and was known to heckle those who made it to first base. He also volunteered for Shriner's Hospital in Erie helping with the sled hockey and the wheelchair basketball programs.

Steve was a member of Luther Memorial Church. He enjoyed fishing boating biking golf and spending time with his family and his best four-legged buddy Tanner. Steve loved cheering for the Notre Dame football team and was so proud to have attended a home game. He was also a huge fan of the Pittsburgh teams-the Pirates the Penguins and the Steelers.

Steve is survived by his loving wife of 40 years Christine (Wujcik) Narusewicz; son Zachary Narusewicz and wife Jodie of Erie; daughter Sara Narusewicz of Erie; and several cousins nieces and nephews. In addition to his parents he was preceded in death by his brothers Robert and Michael; and sister Julia.

The family would like to thank Interim Hospice for the wonderful care given to Steve.

The second weekend of Summerfest 2021 ended with perfect Big Gig weather — sunny and hot.

Did the music match the meteorology? Here's some of the best and worst of what was heard on the grounds on the second Saturday of the world's largest music festival.

ZZ Top

Founding ZZ Top bassist and vocalist Dusty Hill's death in July might have sidelined the band if it hadn't been for his insistence that they carry on with longtime guitar tech Elwood Francis on bass.

Need a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.

Having spent 50 years perfecting that sound he had nothing to worry about. Francis carried on admirably the camaraderie between him and singer-guitarist Billy Gibbons undeniable on a balmy Milwaukee Saturday night at the UScellular Connection Stage.

Fans of filthy blues-rock guitar tone may as well have camped out at the UScellular stage this weekend. Between George Thorogood on Thursday and Gibbons Saturday it doesn't get much better.

Two lyrical alterations in the slow swampy ""Jesus Just Left Chicago"" will stick out in attendees' memories: "" … Then he got wise and came up here to Wisconsin"" and ""You don't have to worry 'cause Dusty Hill is still his man.""

More and more rock concerts become tributes to fallen heroes. This one even included a prerecorded Hill vocal for the band's ""Tush"" encore. It still stood tall (and loud) on its own merits.

Kesha

Late Saturday night at the BMO Harris Pavilion became later then even later until 45 minutes after the time when electro-pop luminary Kesha was supposed to start she materialized onstage to roars of approval rather than brickbats of disdain.

So what were the consolations of the late start? Perhaps it made the contemplation of the giant inflatable cactus rainbow and mushroom all the more poignant especially when the woman herself appeared with two crawling leashed dancers in various nylon and bondage items and launched into “Cannibal.”

She did sing in solidly pop-bombastic form and in a semi-tradition probably enshrined by Madonna did show off most of her posterior. From there it was into “We R Who We R” and the packed-in crowd seemed to forgive all. Is there an apology exemption for pop stars?

311

311 the pop/rock/ska/hip-hop band has 13 studio albums and has been performing together since 1990. I went into their performance at the Generac Power Stage knowing three songs and a possible fourth.

The moment lead singer Nick Hexum started belting out notes there was no doubt it was 311. His voice is so distinct it reeks of the '90s. The same went for MC/rapper Doug “S.A.” Martinez who feverishly hopped from turntable to microphone throughout the show.

The Generac audience was amped and bellowed out lyrics from their first album to last while posers like me eagerly awaited anything off “311” (also know as the band's ""blue album""). Perhaps the highlight was the energy. They were quite spry for guys in their 50s — jumping around the stage and occasionally doing the robot. Guitarist Tim Mahoney was especially animated while getting into riffs and solos.

311’s still got it 13 albums later and the fans still love them. I’m just glad I got to hear “Down.” Thanks for the college flashback fellas.

— Damon Joy Special to the Journal Sentinel

Editor's note: An earlier version of this story said incorrectly that Jim Watson played guitar with 311 Saturday night.

Brett Eldredge

Singer Brett Eldredge embraces the softer side of modern country music. The blue-eyed Paris Illinois native prefers singing love songs to tunes about whiskey fishing and honky-tonk bars.

At a relaxing show Saturday night at the Miller Lite Oasis the handsome crooner began his show with the sincere ""Where the Heart Is"" followed by romantic jams like ""Gabrielle"" and the pretty ""Love Someone.""

Eldredge joined by a modest band maintained a low-key vibe throughout the show. He delivered his songs in a smooth soulful baritone to a youthful audience much of which appeared to be couples and young women. Eldredge genuinely seemed to connect with the crowd pointing at them and putting his hand over his heart at times.

For many it appeared that the singer's concert was a perfect date night.

— Catherine Jozwik Special to the Journal Sentinel

Tank and the Bangas

Anyone who's seen ""Summer of Soul"" is liable to feel like the time is right for Tank and the Bangas. While the group taps into plenty of those classic grooves there aren't many tributaries of vintage R&B that the group didn't incorporate into their Saturday night set at the Johnson Controls World Sound Stage.

The New Orleans ensemble came off somewhat like Galactic (a Summerfest headliner on Sept. 18) though less dynamic and malleable as focused as the performance was on vocalist Tarriona ""Tank"" Ball. A singer rapper and straight-up ranter Ball commanded the stage for every moment she was on it.

The 2020 best new artist Grammy nominees do have a long way to go to grow into their ambition. Hopefully a sharp rise in their stock hasn't stunted their growth into a more original sound. They had one of the Johnson Controls stage's biggest crowds yet swaying feverishly all the same. Ball herself was so versatile and committed to her chosen theatrics that there's nowhere she couldn't take this act.

The Weather Station

Although the Weather Station finished its set by about 9 p.m. Saturday night at the Briggs & Stratton Big Backyard from the start it created the after-midnight ambience of a band playing what and how it wanted to play.

That didn’t necessarily isolate the band from the audience in large part because Tamara Lindeman the Toronto band’s undisputed but not domineering leader had a way of making people lean toward her performance. With a voice as strong as that of Tori Amos but as direct as that of Bobbie Gentry she wrapped introspection in allure.

Lindeman’s five-person backing band helped her find an onstage expression of “Ignorance” the Weather Station’s startlingly mature fifth album. Pop and jazz flowered from country and folk stems and noise from the surrounding festival never fully drowned this soft private nocturnal garden.

— Jon M. Gilbertson

Living Colour

Living Colour guitarist Vernon Reid would like to apologize for saying “YOLO.”

“That was unconscionable” Reid said meekly from the Uline Warehouse stage early Saturday night after muttering a term that went out of fashion in 2014.

But that’s where any obsolescence about Living Colour ended. Sure the hard rockers’ greatest relevance was in the late '80s and early '90s but the themes of their songs are as relevant as ever. And live they were just as vibrant as frontman Corey Glover’s neon orange dreadlocks.

Playing '93 track “Ignorance Is Bliss” Reid and drummer Will Calhoun wildly went off the rails the anarchic energy symbolizing the terrible pain and suffering in our world we often choose to ignore. And with his head leaning away from the mic his tongue throbbing as he soulfully wailed Glover lent potency to a simmering “Open Letter (to a Landlord)” standing up for the impoverished and oppressed forced out of their homes because of callousness and greed.

Considering the social implications of their songs it’s no surprise that the native New Yorkers called for a moving moment of silence to recognize the attacks on Sept. 11 on the 20th anniversary.

“I want you to think about the people that ran toward the fire that ran into danger that ran against their own interests” Reid said. “Take a quick moment for everything that we’ve lost since then.”

Toad The Wet Sprocket

So this is what those 4 p.m. headliner shows are supposed to feel like.

In scaling back the festival days from 11 to nine Summerfest tripled-down on its daytime headliner bookings hoping to entice more people to get to the grounds earlier. And with attendance noticeably picking up for Week 2 there were a whole lot of people at the Briggs & Stratton Big Backyard to see Toad The Wet Sprocket on a sunny and warm Saturday afternoon.

Every inch of bench space and every picnic table was taken but there was still plenty of space on the periphery to social-distance and clearly see the show.

I can’t say if anyone was deeply engaged with a Toad The Wet Sprocket concert on this September afternoon in 2021 nor was the band especially passionate. But they cast a pleasant soundtrack for a peaceful summer day. Kids chilled under a tree and played with bouncy balls. A guy looked like Muhammad Ali trying to duck and swat at an actual bee. Frontman and guitarist Glen Phillips was barefoot and encouraged fans to get some lemonade.

But if anyone was actually listening closely to Toad The Wet Sprocket they could have taken away an epiphany from a new song no less the title track to last month’s “Starting Now” album.

“Starting with the next breath/I’ll dig a little deeper” Phillips sang. “Live a little kinder/and love a little sweeter.”

The American bank’s 240000 employees could hang up their suits and don business-casual attire—once reserved for casual Fridays—all working week. Some garments remained beyond the pale ( T -shirts flip-flops tank tops yoga pants). But many—polo shirts skirts (of appropriate length) dress sandals—became fair game.

JPMorgan was sartorially speaking ahead of its time among stuffy corporate giants (turtlenecks and hoodies have long been the fashion choice of Silicon Valley titans). Others followed suit as it were. Men’s corporate uniform—and the female power suit designed to mirror it—increasingly came to be seen as a vestige of the male-dominated offices of yore and no longer fit for purpose in a world of greater (though still imperfect) workplace equality. As more and more people ran or cycled to work they found that changing into a full suit was impractical since jackets folded into rucksacks tend to lose their crispness.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDkvMTAvYnVzaW5lc3MvYmFuay1vZi1hbWVyaWNhLWV4ZWN1dGl2ZXMtc3VjY2Vzc2lvbi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bank of America Revamps Leadership but C.E.O. Plans to Stick Around (Published 2021),"Bank of America made sweeping changes to the company’s leadership Friday that elevated several executives including three women to senior jobs and all but guaranteed that Brian Moynihan the chief executive would remain at the helm of the nation’s second-largest bank for years to come.

The company promoted Alastair Borthwick its current head of commercial banking in New York to chief financial officer. It also gave more responsibilities to Dean Athanasia who runs the consumer-banking division from Boston. Lauren Mogensen was elevated to general counsel.

Mr. Moynihan is 61 and the race to succeed him is likely to be a long one. Senior executives being groomed for top jobs typically need several years of experience helping to oversee all aspects of a company before they are deemed eligible to take the helm.

Mr. Moynihan signaled his intention to stick around: In a letter to staff he said the new cohort of leaders will help him run the bank in accordance with a growth strategy he put in place in 2010 — when he took the chief executive job — “through its second decade with me and with all of you.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wb3N0YW5kY291cmllci5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3Mvc2MtYmFua3Mtc2Vlay1yaWdodC1iYWxhbmNlLWFzLWJyYW5jaC1jbG9zaW5ncy1vdXRwYWNlLW9wZW5pbmdzL2FydGljbGVfNGViZWI4ZGEtMTE3ZS0xMWVjLWJjZTktMzdiN2U5OWZhZmY0Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SC banks seek right balance as branch closings outpace openings,"Most bankers don’t like to dwell much on branch closings.

Justin Hawkins is an exception.

“It’s actually one of my favorite topics” said Hawkins region president for Wells Fargo who oversees consumer and small business banking operations for most of South Carolina except the Hilton Head market. “We’ve all been through the pain of watching branches close but I think we’ve done it the right way.”

A newly issued report from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. puts some fresh numbers on the industry’s steady pullback.

The agency's annual accounting of market-share data showed that 28 branches or about 2 percent went dark across South Carolina between mid-2020 and mid-2021 trimming the net balance to 1171 locations.

The most active consolidator during that period was Truist Financial Corp. which this year is taking its cost-cutting axe to about 400 overlapping BB&T and SunTrust locations that it took on when it combined the two regional players in late 2019. In the Palmetto State 17 of the branches were shuttered according to the FDIC report.

First-Citizens of Raleigh was second to Truist with 10 closings followed by Wells Fargo with eight.

South Carolina isn't an outlier. A record 3324 branches were closed nationwide in 2020 or more than three times the number of openings according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.

The pace of the retrenchment has been accelerating. In South Carolina for example banks turned off the lights at 153 branches between 2011 and 2016. But during the past five years closings jumped 76 percent to 270 the FDIC said.

A steady stream of bank buyouts that keeps realigning the business is one of the key culprits as Truist can attest to. The urge-to-merge has whittled the number of lenders that do business in South Carolina to 76 from 116 over the past decade.

Another factor is that customers are more comfortable using ATMs and personal technology to handle routine tasks such as depositing checks through their smartphones. As a result Hawkins said branches are increasingly becoming ""advice centers"" as opposed to their former primary roles as ""transactional centers."""

Celebrity endorsements are nothing new. A celeb can get paid upwards of millions of dollars to promote a food or beverage they probably wouldn't even be in the same room with in their everyday life and make it seem like they love it.

According to NPR Justin Timberlake got ""paid an estimated $6 million"" for his involvement in McDonald's ""I'm Lovin' It"" jingle and Beyoncé earned ""an estimated $50 million"" for her deal with Pepsi back in 2012. In 2016 The Official Journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics published a study on celeb endorsements of food and nonalcoholic drinks and found that 65 ""celebrities were collectively associated with 57 different food and beverage brands owned by 38 parent companies.""

Continuing this trend Dr Pepper's PR team recently announced via PR Newswire that Clemson's star QB DJ Uiagalelei would be teaming up with the soda brand this year. So their reach extends pretty far and wide and they likely aren't shy to ask any celeb they wanted to join team DP. So which standout celebrities have endorsed Dr Pepper in the past?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRyaXZlLmNvbS9uZXdzLzQyMzM1L2ZvdXItbWlsaXRhcnktdmV0cy11cGdyYWRlZC1hbmQtd3JhcHBlZC1hLWdtYy10cnVjay10by1oZWxwLW9uZS1vZi10aGVpci1vd27SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Four Military Vets Upgraded and Wrapped a GMC Truck to Help One of Their Own,"In 2003 now-retired U.S. Army Sergeant Brian Fleming joined the Army straight out of high school spurred to do so because of the events of September 11 2001. He completed his basic training at Fort Benning in Georgia and was assigned to Korea before deploying to Afghanistan in 2006. There he was severely injured in a roadside bombing that led to a much earlier retirement than he had planned.

Military Warriors Support Foundation

While in Afghanistan Sgt. Fleming was inside a vehicle when a Taliban suicide bomber pulled alongside in a minivan. The bomb exploded three feet away from Sgt. Fleming and he woke up on the side of the road two miles from Kandahar Airfield with second and third-degree burns. He spent 14 months at Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio Texas receiving a litany of burn treatments undergoing reconstructive surgery and completing rehab before he was discharged. He was medically retired from the Army on November 11 2007 due to the extent of his cumulative physical and psychological injuries.

Through the Military Warriors Support Foundation Sgt. Fleming applied for assistance to procure a vehicle for his family. The program awards vehicles to combat-wounded veterans and widowed Gold Star spouses; recipients must agree to provide insurance and they receive one full year of family and financial mentoring through the foundation. Once they graduate from the 12-month program the organization releases the lien on the vehicle and transfers the title to them.

Military Warriors Support Foundation

In order to fund the program the MWSF accepts donations of vehicles to sell and the newest creation is a 2018 GMC Sierra SLT. Four veterans with some automotive experience were selected from the Skills4Life program which helps veterans transition back to civilian life. Those men started with a pretty basic truck with a little over 19000 miles on it and re-sculpted it into a very cool vehicle. Modifications include a 6.5-inch suspension lift custom Black Rhino Armory wheels Road Armor Stealth front bumper with an Intimidator Guard light bar five-ton Warn winch heated seats (front and back) an upgraded Bose audio system and a custom handgun safe. In total MWSF estimates they put $20000 or more into the Sierra in partnership with Keurig Dr Pepper in Dallas.

The truck will cross the block at about 1 p.m. CT today wrapped in green and sporting the ""Hero 1"" moniker on the side. I’m hoping Hero 1 raises a lot of money for this foundation that helps military veterans in so many ways.",,,,,,,,,

Missouri turns it over on downs; U

After blocking a field goal Missouri took over possession and marched into UK territory trailing by 7 late in the fourth quarter. But on a 3rd-and-5 Kentucky's J.J. Weaver a Moore High School product sacked Tiger quarterback Connor Bazelak.

That led to a 4th-and-13 pass attempt from Bazelak which fell incomplete after Carrington Valentine broke up the pass.

Following the turnover on downs the Wildcats marched out in victory formation as fans chanted ""blue"" and ""white"" at Kroger Field. UK held on to win 35-28 improving its season record to 2-0 and winning its SEC opener.

Field goal blocked with 2:15 left in regulation

The first field goal attempt of the game was... blocked.

With UK leading 35-28 UK's Matt Ruffolo attempted a 37-yard field goal to give the Wildcats a two-score lead with 2:15 left in the game. But Missouri blocked it and then fell on the bouncing ball to take over possession at their own 45 yard line trailing by 7.

UK re-takes lead on Chris Rodriguez run

Facing a tie game for the first time since it was 0-0 UK quickly scored to take the lead back. Chris Rodriguez ran for 28 yards Will Levis found Justin Rigg for a 28-yard reception and then Rodriguez ran it in for a score to give UK a 35-28 lead with 11:28 left in the game.

Although Rodriguez had one costly fumble earlier in the game he's been the Wildcats leading rusher tallying 184 yards and three touchdowns.

Tigers tie it up in the fourth quarter 28-28

Tie game.

UK nearly had an end zone interception after a tipped pass into the hands of UK's Jalen Geiger but the safety could not hold onto it giving Missouri new life. On the next play a 3rd-and-15 the Tigers threw underneath to running back Tyler Badie who fought forward for a 17-yard touchdown — knotting the game at 28-28 with 13:11 left.

The Wildcats offense which started the game smoothly has punted on each of its past two possessions.

Missouri uses methodical drive to cut into UK lead

It was a relatively easy drive for Missouri — it faced only two third downs each of which was a 3rd-and 1 — as it marched 75 yards in four minutes to cut into UK's lead and make the score 28-21 in the third quarter and that score remains as the fourth quarter begins.

It's been a game of touchdowns; neither team has tried a field goal but the teams have combined to find paydirt seven times.

Second half starts perfectly for Wildcats

UK couldn't have asked for a better opening to the third quarter. On Missouri's second offensive play of the half linebacker Jacquez Jones an Ole Miss transfer leaped backwards to snag an interception and give UK the ball in great field position.

Chris Rodriguez made that field position even better with a 31-yard run and he then scored on the next play to give UK a 28-14 lead with 13:19 left in the third

Halftime: Kentucky 21 Missouri 14

The Wildcats controlled the first half and as they led 21-7 seemed poised to take a three-score lead following a long drive consisting of 12-straight running plays. But just as running back Chris Rodriguez approached the goal line he was hit and fumbled giving Missouri the ball.

The Tigers then put together a lengthy drive of their own concluding with a 17-yard touchdown pass with four seconds remaining in the half to make the score 21-14 at halftime.

UK out-gained Missouri 314 yards to 203 in the half but lead by only one score entering the break. The Tigers will receive the ball to start the third quarter.

9:26 left in the second quarter: UK scores third touchdown

Thanks in large part to a beautiful 49-yard connection from UK quarterback Will Levis to wide receiver Wan'Dale Robinson the Wildcats took a 21-7 lead over Missouri. A 15-yard pass from Levis to Male alum Izayah Cummings set up the long reception to Robinson and Levis eventually scored on the ground with a 3-yard run.

Wildcats throw interception to open second quarter

On the first play of the second quarter UK quarterback Will Levis tried a pass to tight end Izayah Cummings but the ball — which was thrown a bit behind Cummings — bounced off his hands and into the arms of Missouri's Jaylon Carlies.

The Tigers couldn't get much going on their drive however and UK received a punt at their own 8 yard line with 13:00 left in the second quarter.

Missouri scores at end of first quarter

Trailing 14-0 in the first quarter Missouri used a 10-play 75-yard drive to get on the board at Kroger Field Saturday. Missouri quarterback Connor Bazelak found Daniel Parker for a 6-yard touchdown with 27 seconds remaining in the opening period to make the score 14-7.

The Wildcats — which averaged 7.4 yards per play in the first quarter — have the ball at their own 30-yard line to start the second period.

Kentucky offense hums during 80-yard touchdown drive

After Missouri punted on its first possession UK took the ball from its own 20-yard line and then put together a 12-play drive spanning 5 minutes 32 seconds. The Wildcats converted three third downs on the drive: quarterback Will Levis scrambled for one he passed to WanDale Robinson for another and Robinson drew a pass interference for the third.

Running back Chris Rodriguez punched it in for a two-yard touchdown run his second score of the day to give UK a 14-0 lead.

12:52 left in the first quarter UK scores first

On the second play from scrimmage UK's Robinson took a handoff and jetted up the field for a 64-yard gain. Three plays later UK quarterback Levis found running back Chris Rodriguez for a five-yard touchdown.

UK's Matt Ruffolo made the PAT giving the Wildcats a 7-0 lead over the Tigers.

30 minutes before kickoff: Ray Lewis in the house

NFL Hall of Famer Ray Lewis the father of UK wide receiver Rahsaan Lewis is at Kroger Field for the matchup. Before the game which is set to kick off at 7:30 p.m. Lewis spent time on the field talking with players and coaches as well as 2022 four-star OT Kiyaunta Goodwin of Charlestown (IN) UK's top-ranked commit.

Kentucky seeks to begin SEC play with a victory

The Wildcats racked up 564 yards in their season-opening 45-10 victory over visiting Louisiana-Monroe but faces a much stronger opponent in the visiting Missouri Tigers which topped UK 20-10 last year. Missouri beat Central Michigan 34-24 to open its season 1-0.

UK's passing attack looked especially strong in its opener with transfers Will Levis (367 passing yards four touchdowns) and Wan'Dale Robinson (125 receiving yards two scores) leading the way. Super senior Josh Ali also added 136 receiving yards and a touchdown.

If you're making a quick run to Kroger it could mean you need a few more ingredients to cook up a big meal but in the future making that run could indicate your dinner has already been made and is ready to serve. According to Marketplace Kroger announced it has begun a partnership to introduce ghost kitchens in its stores. The announcement comes after the growth in grocery shopping brought on by the pandemic has slowed and consumers are spending more time out of the home according to the outlet.

To meet the shift in customer needs Kroger is partnering with ghost kitchen ""industry leader"" Kitchen United a company known for co-locating several restaurant brands to offer pickup and delivery options from a singular location according to a press release from Kroger. Craig Gauden Kroger's director of partnership development explained ""As we continue to define Kroger as a food destination this collaboration creates another seamless way for our customers to order lunch or dinner for pick up while they shop for groceries or for delivery to their location of choice.""

Amazon Kroger and Walmart will be selling over-the-counter tests ""at cost"" a discount of up to 35% from retail prices over the next three months the Biden administration says.

Private companies that sell direct-to-consumer tests are scrambling to again ramp up production of rapid tests.

Consumers could soon get discounted coronavirus tests at Amazon Kroger and Walmart as part of President Joe Biden's plan to significantly increase testing.

The Biden administration said those three major retailers over the next three months will sell rapid over-the-counter tests ""at cost"" a discount of up to 35% from retail prices.

Biden's strategy calls for spending nearly $2 billion to procure 280 million rapid tests for long-term care facilities community testing sites homeless shelters prisons and other vulnerable populations. Another 25 million free at-home rapid tests would be sent to community health centers and food banks.

Companies say federal support to expand testing options is needed as the delta variant drives demand higher and manufacturers scramble to keep pace.

""There is a big shortage in the market right now across the board"" said Ron Gutman co-CEO of Intrivo a testing manufacturer. ""We have a lot more demand than we’ve ever seen before.""

Intrivio is the technology and business partner of Access Bio one of six companies with Food and Drug Administration authorization to sell home tests directly to consumers. Rapid antigen tests made by Abbott Laboratories Quidel and Ellume have been sold for months by major retailers ranging in price from about $12 to $40 a test. Intrivio/Access Bio expect to begin selling retail rapid tests in the coming weeks.

What we know:Who's covered by Biden's new vaccine mandates? When do they go into effect?

Private companies that sell direct-to-consumer tests are scrambling to again ramp up production of rapid tests.

In June Abbott which makes versions of the Abbott BinaxNow rapid antigen test warned investors of ""significantly lower"" demand for tests and closed a factory in Gurnee Illinois that manufactured the tests a move that eliminated 2000 jobs. More recently Abbott said it was again working to produce more tests. The kits have been available periodically at major retail stores.

Ellume CEO Sean Parsons said the company is moving to 24-hour production to churn out tests at the company's manufacturing site in Australia. The company which secured a $231.8 million Defense Department deal to expand U.S. production plans to open a factory in Maryland by the end of the year.

""We’re certainly looking to increase production as swiftly as we safely can"" Parsons said.

Along with vaccination and wearing masks testing remains an important tool to contain the spread of coronavirus said Marcus Plescia chief medical officer of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.

Plescia said states are once again adding testing options for residents after steering limited resources to vaccination this year.

Is Biden's COVID-19 vaccine mandate a law? What happens to those who don't get the shot?

Rapid home tests are popular with consumers and make it easier to check their status but Plescia said the tests also are more difficult to track because results are often not reported to state and local public health departments.

""If you do test positive you’ve got to do the right thing: stay at home limit your interactions with other people and if you’ve been around other people let them know"" Plescia said. ""The public health departments will do that for you but only if we know you have tested positive.""

Others worry that even with Biden's pledge to expand testing cost will remain a barrier for some. While health insurance companies are required to cover the cost of laboratory-based tests and some rapid antigen tests consumers might not be reimbursed when they buy tests directly from retailers.

""The tests in the United States are more expensive – that does lead to barriers in testing"" said Dr. Julie Swann a North Carolina State professor and health systems expert.

Swann cited Great Britain's routine screening of children as the example of national testing program that has ""had a huge impact on reducing transmission.""

The Biden plan probably will require a wide variety of tests not just rapid tests consumers can purchase at retail stores. The federal Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration will develop a rule requiring businesses with 100 or more employees to mandate vaccinations or require weekly testing.

Many employers already require workers to be tested regularly before entering an office or a manufacturing site and the increased testing has testing manufacturers scrambling to meet demand.

""We are literally working around the clock to increase capacity"" Gutman said. ""We feel there is an urgency around getting more tests to market.""

What you need to know

The goals of this study were to examine the digital realities for rural education in Manitoba by exploring the current digital policies programming and practices in select rural and northern school divisions in Manitoba.

Why this research is important

From fall 2020 to summer 2021 the study allowed the team to investigate how the pandemic affected the digital realities of school divisions and to see firsthand how digital policy and practice morphed and adapted to meet the learning needs of students parents and teachers during the school closures of the Covid-19 pandemic.

How the research was conducted

The study was conducted in two phases. The first phase of this study involved scanning divisional websites and social media presence of select rural and Northern Manitoba school divisions to gather (public) information about digital policies infrastructure procedures and practices. This was done to build a ‘digital profile’ of rural and Northern Manitoba school divisions providing local context for the second stage.

The second phase consisted of interviews with school division technology coordinators to delve deeper into the policies and practices identified in the first phase. Interviews also allowed the research team to explore the challenges solutions and innovations arising because of the Covid-19 pandemic and related school closures.

What the researchers found

Our full report has more detailed findings but a brief synopsis of our findings in key areas is as follows:

TECHNOLOGY POLICY: All the school divisions examined had policies around digital technology and guidelines around the acceptable use of technology within their schools. Most acceptable use policies and procedures are based on trust honesty and responsibility.

POWER DYNAMICS INFLUENCED BY PHILOSOPHICAL PERSPECTIVE OF POLICY: The philosophical perspectives that undergirded policy statements had significant implications for how decision-making regarding technology was processed. In some divisions teachers had more control over which software they preferred how to manage devices filtering and blocking etc. In places where power was kept local divisions could roll out devices quickly and pivot and respond with agility in an online learning environment. The local school board was responsive to the context including knowledge about barriers such as infrastructure and access and viewed their job as supporting the decisions from the field and equipping through access to training or funding for infrastructure. At the other end of the spectrum there were examples of large distances between teachers and those making the decisions. Sometimes this was further complicated because of large demographics geography complex policies communication issues or lack of familiarity with existing structures. In these cases it took longer for things to happen.

Recommendations

Digital Equity: Not being able to access technology such as laptops or not having access to the internet with no data caps was a roadblock faced by many divisions schools and students in Manitoba. Manitoba has one of the lowest broadband speeds in Canada. We need to ensure that divisions and schools have sufficient digital infrastructure and HR resources that are equitable across the province. We need to ensure that connectivity devices and staffing resources are invested in and supported.

Rural Divisions face the most significant challenge in achieving digital equity: Accessing the internet and internet speeds was one major obstacle for rural divisions and remote regions in Manitoba. We need to invest and build digital equity now.

Digital choice is essential: It is a common and tempting approach to standardize across the province—however similarly to the success of creating an atmosphere of trust and responsibility of digital use within schools divisions have demonstrated that retaining their flexibility regarding devices software and digital policy rather than being mandated is an effective approach.

Levelling up digital skills through professional development and access to learning opportunities for teachers: The success of the rapid transition to remote learning across the province showcases the digital potential of rural schools and divisions. To make the most effective use of digital technologies in rural and northern regions it is essential to help teachers staff and students continue levelling up their digital skills.

How this research can be used

Our work can help inform stakeholders at various levels—students caregivers teachers administrators and policymakers—of the effects of technology policies in schools effective technology use for education and teacher training digital citizenship and digital equity.

But many Nevada businesses and public institutions have already put their own employee vaccine mandates in place with more in the works as the federal government finalizes the new rule and fleshes out its finer points. Some have gone further by requiring vaccinations not just for employees but as a condition of entry for members of the public including at conventions athletic events and concerts.

At the same time some rural governments have passed resolutions banning vaccine mandates to varying degrees.

Read below for more information about what entities already have mandates in place and which policies go beyond the new federal requirement.

Faced with pandemic-induced lockdown and protests against racial injustice America’s glitterati started acting... weird. Performative gestures abounded (lots of awkward singing and earnest speeches) but they all fell flat crushed under the weight of all the money celebrities could donate to the cause if they just stopped talking and... well you know.

And yet it appears the entertainment industry has found a new way to make activism all about itself.

Usher Priyanka Chopra and Julianne Hough are set to co-host The Activist this fall. The five-week reality series will find six activists collaborating with three “high-profile public figures” Deadline reports as they compete for a spot at the G20 Summit in Rome.

Global Citizen an international nonprofit working to end extreme poverty is producing the series along with Live Nation. Activists will compete to promote causes under one of three umbrellas: health education or environment. Online engagement social metrics and the show’s hosts will determine the success of these efforts and ultimately the winner will be whichever group receives the “largest commitment.”

And because even fundraising needs a little zhuzh Deadline reports the finale will also include musical performances “by some of the world’s most passionate artists.” Presumably the winner will also receive a hearty round of applause from Chopra.

In a statement Live Nation Entertainment CEO Michael Rapino vows that “The Activist will spread awareness about society’s most urgent issues while also giving every viewer the opportunity to be part of the solution—an unprecedented example of how entertainment can change the world.”

As optimistic as executives at Live Nation Global Citizen and CBS appear to be about this new project however The Activist seems likely to resurface the tensions that arose last year between performative “activism” and actual commitment to change.

It started with that treacly “Imagine” video from the beginning of lockdown in which ultra-wealthy A-listers filmed themselves in their mansions butchering a song written by a millionaire urging people to be less materialistic. (Inspiring!) There was also that baffling “I Take Responsibility” PSA in which a bevy of white celebrities put on their best Serious Voices (and turtlenecks) to call out racism and urge others to do the same. And let’s not even talk about “Blackout Tuesday.”

The Activist initially raises the same question these efforts did: If the show’s creators are genuinely concerned about world poverty why not simply donate the funds that would have been used to create and run this series?

One could argue that celebrity advocacy can shape public sentiment and raise awareness around issues that otherwise might not receive such attention. Still it’s fair to wonder whether the entertainment industry is actually equipped to lend a hand. If executives at CBS or any other network or studio care about poverty they might start by paying their own support staff a living wage. Then again that would require as we mentioned before actually opening their purse.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vYmxhYmJlcm1vdXRoLm5ldC9uZXdzL25pY2tlbGJhY2stZmlyZXMtYmFjay1hdC10ZXhhcy1zaW5nZXItb3Zlci1yb2Nrc3Rhci1jb3B5cmlnaHQtaW5mcmluZ2VtZW50LWxhd3N1aXTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NICKELBACK Fires Back At Texas Singer Over 'Rockstar' Copyright Infringement Lawsuit,"NICKELBACK has fired back at a Texas singer over a copyright lawsuit claiming the rock band ripped off its 2005 hit song ""Rockstar"" from an earlier track called ""Rock Star"".

Kirk Johnston filed a lawsuit against NICKELBACK members Chad Kroeger Michael Kroeger Ryan Peake and Daniel Adair as well as the band's former record label Roadrunner Records and Warner Chappell Music Inc. and Live Nation Entertainment Inc. alleging that the NICKELBACK copied his original musical composition ""Rock Star"" which he wrote in 2001 while a member of the band SNOWBLIND REVIVAL.

In August 2001 SNOWBLIND REVIVAL created a master recording of ""Rock Star"" along with three other original songs. The band made 15 copies of the master recording and sent them to several record labels including Universal Music Group and Warner Music Group of which Roadrunner Records Inc. and Warner Chappell Music Inc. are wholly owned indirect subsidiaries. Johnston alleges that NICKELBACK had direct access to Johnston's musical composition ""Rock Star"" as a result of SNOWBLIND REVIVAL's marketing efforts.

In January 2005 NICKELBACK released the song ""Rockstar"" on its album ""All The Right Reasons"". Johnston alleges that ""a substantial amount of the music in 'Rockstar' is copied from [his] original composition 'Rock Star'"" including ""the tempo song form melodic structure harmonic structures and lyrical themes.""

Now in an answer to Johnston's original complaint NICKELBACK stated that ""the two songs sound nothing alike."" The band went on to say that ""Johnston failed to identify any specific lyrical similarities between the works at issue; he could only conceivably point to the titles of the two works and 'lyrical themes'. Titles are not protectable by copyright and their similarity cannot give rise to an infringement claim. Nor does copyright protect the commonplace lyrical theme of imagining being a rock star.""

NICKELBACK wrote in the court document: ""As for the music it is evident to an ordinary observer that the sound recording of [Johnston's song] has a steady driving guitar beat whereas [NICKELBACK's 'Rockstar'] does not and is obviously slower. The two songs are not in the same key; [Johnston's song] is in a major key whereas [NICKELBACK's 'Rockstar'] is in both major and minor keys. Further the styles of the two works are different. Even [Johnston] acknowledges that his band SNOWBLIND REVIVAL and NICKELBACK play different genres of music: 'Unlike NICKELBACK's hard rock sound SNOWBLIND REVIVAL would be considered an alternative rock band with more indie/eclectic roots.' And most importantly the melodies of [Johnston's song] and [NICKELBACK's 'Rockstar'] sound nothing alike.""

NICKELBACK also pointed out that Johnston ""provides no details"" of his purported meetings with record-label higher-ups ""such as the names of the record label representatives with whom he allegedly met where the meetings took place or even when the meetings took place."" The band also claimed that Johnston ""has failed to allege any means by which [his song] could have ended up in the hands of the individual members of NICKELBACK who composed 'Rockstar'. None of these allegations describe a chain of events that links [Johnston's song] to the creation of [NICKELBACK's 'Rockstar'].""

Johnston is seeking damages for copyright infringement and an injunction against further infringement.

Last month Magistrate Judge Susan Hightower said in her report and recommendation to Judge Robert Pitman of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas that Johnston's complaint sufficiently alleged NICKELBACK's members had access to his song ""Rock Star"".

""Johnston has alleged facts sufficient to raise his right to relief above the speculative level which is all that is required at the pleading stage"" Hightower said.

NICKELBACK had asserted that Johnston cannot state a claim for copyright infringement because ""fundamentally the works at issue are not substantially similar to an ordinary observer."" They argued that the works are so dissimilar as to defeat Johnston's claim for copyright infringement as a matter of law.

Having listened to both songs Hightower found that it is possible for a reasonable juror to determine that the works share protectable elements. Whether Johnston will be able to produce evidence that these similarities rise to the level of ""substantial"" or ""striking"" in view of NICKELBACK's level of access is yet to be determined she said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBoaWxseW1hZy5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxLzA5LzExL3VwdG93bi10aGVhdGVyLW5vcnRoLWJyb2FkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Before COVID the Uptown Theater Had a Real Shot at Revival.

The onset of the pandemic and the death of the North Philadelphia theater’s champion threw into question what would come next for the iconic venue that had already been through its share of ups and downs.

If you find yourself in conversation with a North Philadelphian of a certain age chances are you’ll hear a tale about a night at the Uptown Theater.

During its heyday from the 1950s until it closed its doors in 1978 the theater — located on Broad Street between Susquehanna and Dauphin — featured performers ranging from gospel legends to comedy titans to Motown royalty.

For a ticket price that modern-day concertgoers couldn’t even imagine — an evening with Diana Ross of the Supremes cost $2.50 in the ’60s — legendary WDAS radio personality and producer Georgie Woods put on shows featuring the likes of the Jackson Five the Temptations “Little” Stevie Wonder Smokey Robinson and the Miracles and the Four Tops.

But the Uptown hasn’t been in use for concerts since the 1980s when acts such as New Edition and RUN DMC took the stage during a short-lived revival. After that True Light Community Ministries used the building for services until 1991.

When longtime community organizer Linda Richardson head of the Uptown Entertainment Development Corporation bought the theater in 2001 she dreamed of restoring it to its former glory. But at the time those days seemed long gone — and despite several other efforts no one had been able to bring them back says her daughter Monifa Young who currently sits on the UEDC board.

“It was in poor structural shape — damage due to floods and fires and the neglect of the previous owners” recalls Young. Initial fund-raising had to go toward paying off tens of thousands of dollars in outstanding tax debt. The roof was collapsing on both sides and every day the theater fell further into disrepair.

“But it’s a part of Philadelphia history and a part of Black history” says Young. “So we couldn’t let that happen.”

As a former co-director of the People’s Fund (the precursor to Philly’s Bread & Roses community fund which raises money toward social change) Richardson understood the importance of the arts and community development. Her plan involved yes reopening the theater. But beyond that she dreamed of converting the building’s upper floors into a community hub and business incubator that might spur further development on a long-neglected stretch of Broad. Over the years she raised more than $3 million to make immediate repairs and start further renovations. Under her leadership the building once again began to play a role in the community arts scene.

Then in November of 2020 Richardson died suddenly at age 73. Her passing threw into question what would come next for an iconic venue that had already been through its share of ups and downs — and by extension the North Philadelphia neighborhood that surrounds it.

•

The Uptown got its start in 1929 as a movie palace for the Warner Brothers/Stanley Theaters chain according to the book After the Final Curtain: The Fall of the American Movie Theater. Designed by the Philadelphia firm of Magaziner Eberhard and Harris the five-story building included a theater with high ceilings stained-glass windows terra-cotta walls and velvet seats. It was a classy elegant place to bring a date to the movies and maybe go out for a bite afterward.

In the 1950s the theater was one of the go-to sites on the Chitlin’ Circuit a group of venues that gave African American performers the chance to entertain audiences at a time when segregation kept the likes of comedians Redd Foxx and Flip Wilson out of venues considered more mainstream.

In the ’60s the Uptown was at the height of its relevance hosting night after night of legendary acts. Many of those shows were performances with a purpose. Because Georgie Woods was a friend of civil rights leader and Philadelphia NAACP president Cecil B. Moore the Uptown was the setting for “Freedom Shows” that featured high-profile performers like Jackie Wilson and raised money to further civil rights causes.

The theater was active as a concert venue until closing in 1978. By then Woods had stopped promoting shows there due to concerns about safety in North Philadelphia. Gang violence and the beginnings of the crack cocaine epidemic were taking root in the neighborhood. The disinvestment in North Philadelphia that followed kept promoters from taking the venue seriously as a performance space. By the time True Light Community Ministries started using the theater for services in the 1980s the building had changed owners several times.

In 1980 community activist John Bowser bought the venue for $200000 and gave his son Kyle the job of managing it and booking shows at the New Uptown Theater and Entertainment Center or NU-TEC. To reopen the venue John Bowser borrowed $1.3 million from Continental Bank with $1.266 million guaranteed by the City of Philadelphia under former mayor W. Wilson Goode Sr. He also got loans from two other city banks and the federal Small Business Administration none of which NU-TEC could pay back. The venue opened and closed within weeks.

Following Bowser’s death in 1983 a group called Uptown Associates that included Liberty Place developer Willard Rouse took ownership of the Uptown pledging to do with the site what Bowser couldn’t. But that group too was unable to make the financials work.

And then came Linda Richardson. Richardson who grew up in North Philadelphia had studied at the Pennsylvania Dance Academy was part of a dance troupe called the Black Butterfly and had been a part of the Black Arts Movement. When revitalizing North Philadelphia became a priority for city officials in the 1990s she was working as a community organizer and took part in a project that renovated five houses across the street from the theater. The venue which at that point had long been vacant had been vandalized. Residents wanted something done about it.

On the theater’s 90th anniversary the lights of the marquee were relit with plans to keep them shining through the end of construction. Excitement and momentum were building.

Richardson called John Street then a City Councilperson and spoke with him and his chief of staff at the time Darrell Clarke.

According to the late Philadelphia Tribune reporter Kimberly C. Roberts in her book Joy Ride: The Stars and Stories of Philly’s Famous Uptown Theater Street’s answer motivated Richardson: “He said ‘If you don’t have keys you can’t do anything. You have to own it.’”

So she got to work. First Richardson got a grant from the Governor’s Commission on African American Affairs to do a study to see if the community would support her plans for the venue. Once that was confirmed she formed the UEDC which purchased the Uptown in 2001.

Under her leadership the UEDC immediately undertook the repairs necessary to stabilize the structure. After that the group began to re-engage with the community. By 2017 Uptown Radio a low-power station at WJYN 98.5 began broadcasting from the UEDC’s conference center across the street from the theater using an antenna on the theater itself according to Yumy Odom who runs the station in his role as UEDC’s programming director. The station provides North Philadelphia residents with news music and other programming tailored specifically for their community.

On the theater’s 90th anniversary in 2019 the lights of the marquee were relit to commemorate the occasion with plans to keep them shining through the end of construction. Excitement and momentum were building. Then the pandemic hit and shortly thereafter the project lost its visionary leader.

•

Up until her death in November 2020 from a heart attack Richardson was still raising funds to move the Uptown project forward. And although she’s gone her work continues.

Richardson had the foresight to prepare the Uptown for a future without her at the helm Monifa Young says. A 12-person board remains in place and the community engagement work Richardson valued continues under the guidance of Marcia Abdul-Malik the office administrator.

“We had already been talking about a two-year transition plan” says Young. “She was going to retire in two years and was already cultivating the next group of leaders to take over.”

The vision remains ambitious and UEDC has done extensive research on the ways the theater’s reinvigoration and the company itself can best serve the community which has said it wants nothing less than the return of the sort of bustling business corridor that defined the stretch of Broad in previous eras. “The community wants restaurants recording studios — even a daycare center has been suggested” Young says. “The development of the theater is just one of the many signature projects of the corporation.”

The UEDC has set a goal of creating 200 new jobs through the redevelopment of the Uptown building. It has also created a job bank for construction work and commercial-corridor cleaning opportunities and it’s launched the Uptown Youth Got Talent program (Monifa Young runs it) which teaches young people audio/video production and performing arts and offers a paid summer internship program.

The prospects of a revamped Uptown Theater and what it could mean for a section of the city in serious need of good jobs are top of mind for many in North Philadelphia.

“North Broad deserves a lot” says Shalimar Thomas executive director of North Broad Renaissance a nonprofit group charged with revitalizing the north side of Broad Street. “It deserves decent businesses and we’re here to make sure it gets the kind of quality businesses that every other section of the city does.”

When North Broad Renaissance did an initial five-year strategic plan “The Uptown Theater was a part of it” Thomas says. “It’s part of the history of North Broad Street. It’s also a part of the community’s vision for North Broad Street and it’s from the community that we take our cues.”

But there’s an underlying concern that any economic development of North Broad even with the Uptown at the center could have deleterious repercussions. This is a neighborhood after all that’s been fighting with Temple University over how a proposed on-campus football stadium might displace families and accelerate gentrification making it unaffordable and inhospitable to long-term residents.

For an example of how this can all go wrong one need only look a mile down the road to the Metropolitan the former opera house at Broad and Poplar. The Met which like the Uptown is on the National Register of Historic Places was a vacant historic theater falling into disrepair in 1996 when the Holy Ghost Headquarters Revival Center bought it and sank $5 million into renovations to keep it from falling down. For years only half of the structure was in use.

Then in 2017 Holy Ghost Headquarters and builder Eric Blumenfeld began a partnership that led to a $56 million renovation. The deal gave concert promoter Live Nation the right to book shows for artists such as John Oliver Mariah Carey John Legend and Madonna at the venue built by Oscar Hammerstein in 1908.

But the relationship has been tense. In late 2019 Blumenfeld filed suit against Live Nation claiming the concert promoter hasn’t honored its agreement to pay him $1.5 million in “fixed minimum rent” and an additional $2 for every ticket sold in exchange for use of the venue.

The concert promoter was also supposed to have the venue open by 7 a.m. on Sundays for church services and for public use as needed which the suit says hasn’t happened. In the filing Mark Hatcher pastor of Holy Ghost Headquarters accuses the promoter of not honoring the clause concerning the church and creating an “environment of bullying.” (Live Nation has called the suit an “attempt to extort additional rent.”)

Like the Met the Uptown is considered a potential anchor for commercial growth on its part of North Broad North Broad Renaissance’s Thomas says. But the community and the UEDC hope that growth will be deliberate — and will promote local businesses and community groups rather than pushing them out. Based on how things have gone at the Met and elsewhere in the neighborhood there’s a wariness about the ultimate impact of the Met’s redevelopment and that reticence attaches to the Uptown project.

The Uptown “is being intentional to make sure that it complements some of the other plans for the neighborhood” says State Senator Sharif Street whose district includes the Uptown. “It could serve as an anchor to help all of the other businesses and do it in a way that is still consistent with the values of the people who live in the community.”

The hope is that once the theater is developed other locally owned small businesses will gravitate there and join the National Black Doll Museum and the shops that currently occupy space nearby.

“This is probably the only block of Broad with African American [business] ownership on it” Yumy Odom says and the community would like to see more not less as the theater develops.

•

Of course without a big-business development partner like the one the Met had the math around development is trickier. But there are other ways to partner.

In 1982 the Greater Philadelphia Community Development Corporation successfully applied to get the Uptown which it owned at the time added to the National Register of Historic Places.

While that may have spared the building from the wrecking ball the designation added a new set of challenges — namely restoring historic buildings isn’t cheap. It will take at least another $7 million estimates say to finish just basic renovations to the nearly 100-year-old theater and office building. A daycare center and recording studio would tack on a lot more.

The building’s status as a historical landmark does make it eligible for grants and tax breaks according to Patrick Grossi director of advocacy for the Preservation Alliance of Greater Philadelphia which has pledged to help. “We had a good relationship with Linda Richardson” he says. “And we’re happy to support her family members or anyone else who is trying to see her dream through to fruition.”

And because a historical preservation designation is permanent the UEDC can take all the time it needs to get the money tax credits and other help required to continue restoring the building.

Plans for the Uptown’s return also happen to align with City Council President Darrell Clarke’s ambition to tackle entrenched poverty as part of this year’s budget cycle. Some 45 percent of the city’s extreme poverty can be found in North Philly and the new budget includes $400 million in funding for job creation training opportunities and economic development. While Clarke says the Uptown is important to North Philadelphia — and the city has given the venue money toward its development in the past — there was no commitment to the theater in this year’s city budget.

In the meantime the Uptown Entertainment Development Corporation soldiers on.

Tours of the theater have been put on hold while SEPTA conducts upgrades outside of the building. But Uptown Radio continues to broadcast giving a voice to a community that isn’t always heard and providing training to local youth. Plans to move the station into the theater itself have been delayed due to COVID but Odom hopes to be there by 2023. Fund-raising efforts are always ongoing.

Despite losing their founder the new leaders of the UEDC say they have no plans to quit to sell the iconic building or to break down its walls. They’re committed to it.

“We’re not going to sell out for $10000 or $20000 when we know how much work has gone into this building” Young says. “We’re not willing to sell out my mother’s vision and the community interest.”

The potential pitfalls are many but as long as everyone remains on the same page and adheres to Richardson’s vision the Uptown Theater — and by extension North Philadelphia — stands a chance.

All hail the Activist Industrial Complex

Looks like the revolution will be televised after all: a new reality show called The Activist is coming to the US next month. Produced by Global Citizen it’s essentially a social justice spin on The Apprentice or The Voice: six activists battle it out to promote their causes in front of a panel of celebrity judges. The winning team gets to go to the G20 Summit in Italy where according to the press release they’ll try to secure “funding and invaluable awareness for their causes”. According to the CEO of Live Nation Entertainment the show is an “unprecedented example of how entertainment can change the world”.

Is it really? Because to me it sounds rather more like the latest example of how “changing the world” has morphed into meaningless entertainment. It sounds to me like the inevitable result of the rise of performative activism and the proliferation of celebrity activists. And I’m not exactly the only one who doesn’t feel particularly empowered or inspired by The Activist’s premise. News of the show hasn’t gone down very well with a number of activists who have questioned just how helpful it is to pit causes against each other.

One of my main issues with the show – an opinion which to be fair is based only on the press release – is the fact that it seems to boil activism down to how viral you can go on social media. Per the press release “the competing activists’ success is measured via online engagement social metrics and hosts’ input”. That’s an incredibly unhelpful way to think about how you go about building effective movements. Alicia Garza the co-founder of Black Lives Matter writes at length about this in her must-read book The Purpose of Power. One of the main messages in Garza’s book is that there isn’t a quick and easy way to build a “movement”. You can’t tweet and TikTok your way to a better world you’ve got to put in the work. That takes grassroot organising; it takes the sort of work that doesn’t immediately make for a great reality TV show.

Another thing that doesn’t exactly instill me with confidence in the series is the panel of celebrity judges: Usher Priyanka Chopra Jonas and Julianne Hough. What exactly qualifies them to advise activists on what effective campaigning looks like? Chopra Jones in particular has been the subject of quite a bit of controversy. In 2019 she was criticized for tweeting support for the Indian armed forces after they conducted airstrikes in Pakistan; at the time she was the Unicef ambassador for peace. The actress also hosted Narendra Modi India’s prime minister at her lavish wedding in 2018. Modi makes an unusual pal for someone who reckons they’re an authority on activism: his militant Hindu nationalism for example has turned India into a very dangerous place to be a Muslim. Modi has also been dismantling democracy in India: this year Sweden’s V-Dem Institute a research institute that produces an annual Democracy Report downgraded India’s classification from “world’s largest democracy” to “electoral autocracy.” But all that probably doesn’t bother Chopra Jonas too much. In a 2019 interview she said she considers herself “apolitical as much as I can be. I prefer to be a humanitarian.” If you think that humanitarianism can ever be apolitical then you have no business calling yourself a humanitarian.

Perhaps the worst thing about The Activist however is the social justice capitalism it represents. Like feminism activism has been consumed by the corporate world. It’s been given a glossy sheen; had its revolutionary edges removed. Corporate feminism undermines structural change by focusing on individual empowerment. Social justice capitalism – or “woke-washing” – is similar. It peddles the convenient lie that you can change the world without fundamentally changing your habits. It divorces individual “causes” from the exploitative structures underlying them. It pretends you can be a humanitarian while being apolitical.

Anyway all that said I don’t want to knock The Activist too much. Yes it looks a lot like vapid clicktivism. Yes it’s fronted by someone who thinks it’s cool to invite an authoritarian to her wedding. But you know? Icky as it may be the show is also a sign of progress. While corporate activism is problematic the fact that social justice has gone mainstream and activism is aspirational is ultimately something to celebrate.

France to offer free contraception to women under 25

Liberté! Égalité! No imminent maternité! (I know I know but I’m afraid it was the best joke I could come up with). You know what’s a real joke though? The fact that in the US a number of employers can use religious objection to deny women insurance coverage for contraception.

Australia just held a national summit on women’s safety

While that’s certainly commendable why is there always so much focus on women’s safety instead of male violence? “I wonder how the discussions would change if instead of a #WomensSafetySummit we had a #MensViolenceSummit?” the author Jess Hill wondered on Twitter. “Genuine question. How would our perspectives and solutions shift if we put men’s violence in the foreground?”

The week in Petersburgarchy

Reckon the recall election in California is a mess? Boris Vishnevsky a Russian politician who wants to keep his seat in the St Petersburg legislative assembly is facing two rivals with exactly the same name and facial hair as him. This isn’t an uncanny coincidence it’s an attempt to undermine him. Vishnevsky claims the other two Boris Vishnevskys changed their names and altered their appearance so as to confuse voters. It may be corrupt but they certainly get points for creativity.

Over the course of the past 20 years they've brought in a stunning $7.35 trillion in revenue according to a Defense News database. The overwhelming majority of that money came from the Pentagon. Why it matters: Gone are the days when most of the defense budget was spent directly on soldiers. Since 9/11 war has become ""modernized"" — which means it's fought with extremely expensive weapons bought from highly profitable private-sector companies.

Flashback: When the New York stock market finally reopened on 9/17 still surrounded by ash from the smoking Twin Towers the S&P 500 fell by a sharp 5% from its closing level on 9/10 — and then kept on falling over the subsequent days.

America's biggest defense contractor Lockheed Martin didn't follow suit. Instead its stock rose by 15% on 9/17 to $43.95 per share. Today it trades at $349.

Lockheed Martin didn't follow suit. Instead its stock rose by 15% on 9/17 to $43.95 per share. Today it trades at $349. By the numbers: In 2000 Lockheed Martin's defense revenue was $18 billion or about 71% of its total revenues. By 2020 its defense revenue had soared to $63 billion or 96% of the company's total income.

Be smart: The growth in private-sector outlays is unlikely to end any time soon. ""What you are seeing is primarily funding for R&D and procurement of weapons"" says Todd Harrison a defense budget analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9jb21tZW50aXNmcmVlLzIwMjEvc2VwLzExL3VzLWFmZ2hhbmlzdGFuLWlyYXEtZGVmZW5zZS1zcGVuZGluZ9IBWmh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9jb21tZW50aXNmcmVlLzIwMjEvc2VwLzExL3VzLWFmZ2hhbmlzdGFuLWlyYXEtZGVmZW5zZS1zcGVuZGluZw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Where did the $5tn spent on Afghanistan and Iraq go? Here’s where,"While Washington bickers about what if anything has been achieved after 20 years and nearly $5tn spent on “forever wars” there is one clear winner: the US defense industry.

In Iraq and Afghanistan the American military relied to an unprecedented degree on private contractors for support in virtually all areas of war operations. Contractors supplied trucks planes fuel helicopters ships drones weapons and munitions as well as support services from catering and construction to IT and logistics. The number of contractors on the ground outnumbered US troops most years of the conflicts. By the summer of 2020 the US had 22562 contractor personnel in Afghanistan – roughly twice the number of American troops.

The gravy train for the defense industry was also fueled by the way the wars were budgeted and paid for. Congress used “emergency” and “contingency” funding that circumvented the normal budget process. For the first decade of the conflict the US used emergency appropriations which are typically reserved for one-off crises such as floods and hurricanes. Detailed spending oversight was minimal. And because this type of spending is excluded from budget projections and deficit estimates it enabled everyone to sustain the pretense that the wars would be over shortly.

The result was what former defense secretary Robert Gates termed a “culture of endless money” inside the Pentagon. The defense department made the operational decisions; managed the bidding process for contractors; awarded the contracts (largely using non-competitive bids); and kept at least 10% of the wartime funding in classified accounts.

Not even the financial crisis of 2008 could interrupt the spending spree. While Congress imposed across-the-board spending caps on government programs war spending was specifically excluded. The Pentagon was able to use the special “contingency” war budget to buy upgrades services and new equipment that were barely related to Iraq or Afghanistan. Consequently the Pentagon budget kept growing – and was able to double its size between 2001 and 2020.

Defense stocks outperformed the stock market overall by nearly 60% during the Afghanistan war as the war spending surge enabled a wave of consolidation in the industry. The big five – Lockheed Martin Boeing General Dynamics Raytheon and Northrop Grumman – and a handful of others acquired the next tier of manufacturers such as Hughes Aircraft and McDonnell Douglas.

In the year to June 2020 the big five accounted for nearly a third of the $480bn obligated by the Pentagon to defense contractors. While only a fraction of these sales went specifically for Iraq and Afghanistan the conflict was highly lucrative for all the major defense contractors. For example Lockheed Martin manufactured the Black Hawk helicopters used extensively in Afghanistan; Boeing sold the aircraft and land combat vehicles; Raytheon won the major contract training the Afghan air force; and Northrup Grumman and General Dynamics supplied electronic and communications equipment. Thousands of subcontractors around the world earned money from selling night-vision goggles engines sandbags communications equipment and all manner of stuff to the war effort. And global oil companies were key war beneficiaries since the Pentagon is the world’s single largest purchaser of fuel.

Meanwhile the defense sector spent over $2.4bn lobbying Congress since 2001 and made direct campaign contributions to most members.

The US presence on the ground may now be over. But America will still have to digest the huge price tag

Not surprisingly much of the wartime expenditures were highly wasteful. The Inspectors Generals for Afghanistan and Iraq the Wartime Contracting Commission and the Pentagon’s own inspector general all documented waste profiteering corruption and “ghost spending” (money spent on activities that turned out not to exist at all).

According to government analysts the net result of the large-scale private sector involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan was to increase materially the cost of war operations. Much of the $145bn reconstruction money was spent on questionable projects with budgets that seemed excessive or simply could not be accounted for. Many such projects now destroyed and dilapidated have littered the front pages over the past week.

The US presence on the ground may now be over. But America will still have to digest the huge price tag. The wars were paid for entirely with borrowed money rather than raising taxes – a first in US military history – and the US still owes $2tn in future veterans’ benefits. This financial hangover will be compounded by the need to replace what has been destroyed or simply left behind and to pay for the weapons and equipment purchased during the last 20 years of go-go defense spending. The legacy of the post-9/11 defense spending binge will continue to gobble up the US budget for years to come.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vb2JpdHMuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9kYWxsYXNtb3JuaW5nbmV3cy9uYW1lL3JheW1vbmQtYmVsbC1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0xOTY3NDk0NdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Raymond Bell Obituary (1932 - 2021) - Dallas TX - Dallas Morning News,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://obits.dallasnews.com/us/obituaries/dallasmorningnews/name/raymond-bell-obituary?id=19674945 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vb2JpdHMuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9kYWxsYXNtb3JuaW5nbmV3cy9uYW1lL3JheW1vbmQtYmVsbC1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0xOTY3NDk0NdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiKmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvaWFtLm9yZy9zdGFmZi9wYXVsLXNoZXBoZXJkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Paul Shepherd - IAMAW,"Brother Shepherd studied business at Utah Valley University earning a degree and an early work history in accounting and economics.

Even President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. an embodiment of the Washington establishment for decades has embraced populist elements in his platform. (Core to his “Build Back Better” plan is “Buy American” after all.)

As Heidi Heitkamp the former Democratic senator from North Dakota put it people increasingly ask of government and business leaders “What the heck are those guys doing for me?” The answer as they see it: “It seems like they are really focused on themselves.” That attitude and the ire it stokes has put ever more pressure on fundamental systems like capitalism and democracy with the potential to reshape society in countless ways.

As part of the DealBook D.C. Policy Project in early December The New York Times gathered a virtual panel of executives academics and policymakers like Ms. Heitkamp — “people who to much of the outside world can be defined as belonging to the elite of American society” said the moderator The Times Opinion columnist Bret Stephens — to discuss what leaders could do to answer and counter that outrage or risk it burning even hotter.

(KGUN) — If you shop at Fry’s Walmart or Lowe's you’ve seen them stand-alone patrol cameras are taking up space in Tucson parking lots.

""They really wanted to show a presence in their parking lots where they were able to help their patrons feel safer and have a feeling of control in the parking lots"" Lindsey said.

Steve Lindsey with LiveView Technologies who installs the cameras says the self-contained patrol cam has become an extra set of eyes and security in Tucson parking lots.

""Some customers have seen upwards of a 60% drop in shrinkage in the stores some have seen 30 percent. Within the parking lots themselves they’ve seen a dramatic change in behavior” Lindsey said.

Lindsey also says the cameras use artificial intelligence technology to determine if there’s a threat in the area.

""There’s sophisticated technology in there that’s able to analyze the scene that it’s looking at and can determine what those threats are. Then based on the threat level it will alert people to take notice of that area” Lindsey said.

According to LiveView Technologies the units are solar powered with a cellular connection.

""We call them a rapid deployment solution. They can move them around and bring them up and tear them down very quickly” Lindsey said.

Camera watchers are typically on site to respond to situations; remote command centers contact police when needed.

“That human can get in and in real time they can move the cameras. They can talk through the speakers they can interact with that location. They can do that anywhere in the globe” Lindsey said.

As for pricing it depends on how long you subscribe to the service and your needs. The cameras are used at election polling sites construction sites and businesses of all types and sizes across the country.

REMAINING ANIMALS AT 'TIGER KING' ZOO TO BE TURNED OVER TO JUSTICE DEPARTMENT

Representatives for New York City’s Chief Medical Examiner did not immediately respond to Fox News’ request for information.

However TMZ reports that a close friend is indeed allowed to claim the remains of a deceased person provided there is no immediate next of kin. However it’s unclear if that will be the case when it comes to the ""Tiger King"" star.

Police confirmed to Fox News that they responded to an emergency call of ""an unconscious male inside of 21 East 55 Street in the confines of the 67 Pct.""

DL Chemical Co. the petrochemical arm of South Korea's DL Group will spend 2 trillion won ($1.7 billion) over the next five years to sharply boost its overseas production capacity which will include mergers and acquisitions a company source said on Sunday.



The world's largest producer of polybutene plans to expand its production complexes in the US Europe and the Middle East as part of its push to become one of the world's top 20 chemicals companies. Currently LG Chem Ltd. is the only South Korean company among the 20 largest chemical producers in the world.



DL Chemical is also aiming to transform itself into a manufacturer of high-value specialty chemicals such as construction and electronic chemicals which have been enjoying high demand.



""We're seriously considering making investments to build production facilities abroad including in the US and Europe"" said a DL Chemical source.



DL Chemical one of the petrochemicals-to-construction conglomerate's two key arms controlled 23.3% of the world's polybutene (PB) market as of 2020. PB is a raw material of lubricants adhesives and electrical insulators. It also produces polyethylene used in packaging film plastic bags and laminates.



Last year the company acquired Singapore-based Cariflex Pte from Kraton Corp. a US specialty chemicals company for $530 million. Cariflex produces specialty synthetic rubber and latex used for medical materials such as surgical gloves and rubber stoppers.



""By expanding our global operations and specialty product portfolio we will take the leap to become a global chemicals company"" its Vice Chairman Kim Sang-woo was quoted as saying.



Its cash and cash equivalents amounted to 920.8 billion won as of end-June following its rights offering worth 450 billion won in June.



The company's operating profit reached 53.5 billion won in the first half of the year on course to exceed 100 billion won for the entire year of 2021. This compares with a full-year operating profit of 64 billion won in 2020.



DL Chemical was spun off from DL Holdings Co. formerly known as Daelim Industrial Co. earlier this year. It is now wholly owned by the holding company.



Recently it took over full ownership of both Cariflex in Singapore and DL FnC Co. a manufacturer of biaxially oriented polypropylene (BOPP) film from its parent company DL Holdings. BOPP film is produced by stretching polypropylene film and used as a food packaging material and in electrical applications.

DL Chemical Vice Chair Kim Sang-woo

On top of overseas facility expansion the company will scale up its investment in joint ventures based in South Korea.Last week it set up a JV with US polymer producer REXtac to build a plant to produce eco-friendly hot melt glue in Korea. A hot melt glue is an adhesive that can be melted by heat and used for diapers and industrial products such as automobiles.DL Chemical also operates Yeocheon NCC (naphtha cracking center) a 50:50 venture set up in 1999 with Hanwha Solutions Corp. in addition to PolyMirae a 50:50 polypropylene JV with the Netherlands-based LyondellBasell Industries. Polypropylene is used in automotive components and packaging films.Yeocheon NCC located in the southern port city of Yeocheon produces ethylene and propylene used for industrial chemical and plastic products as well as aromatics for use in plastics and synthetic fibers.Vice Chairman Kim Sang-woo 55 has been spearheading DL Chemical's expansion plans since he joined then Daelim Industrial as an executive director in 2012. The former executive of SK Telecom Co. is now the youngest vice chairman of the country's 30 largest conglomerate units.Its aggressive expansion plan contrasts with other petrochemical companies including South Korea's SK Group which have been scaling back on their traditional businesses in a shift towards eco-friendly ones such as renewable energy and lithium-ion batteries. SK Innovation Co. recently put on hold indefinitely its plan to sell up to a 49% stake in SK Geocentric Co . formerly known as SK Global Chemical Co. because of a wide price gap with bidders composed of private equity firms.SK Geocentric runs one of the country's largest NCCs which produces ethylene and propylene as well as aromatics such as benzene toluene and xylene isomers.Kyung-min Kang at kkm1026@hankyung.com Yeonhee Kim edited this article.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Such was the case last month when the Manhattanite 56 touched down in the City of Angels to give Page Six an exclusive tour of her $13.4 million listing in Malibu.

But before walking us through the expansive James Bond-esque property Bensimon wanted to show us how she spends a day in LA.

From catching up over coffee at her favorite hotel to luxurious facials from her go-to stem cell specialist to sipping trendy smoothies the model-turned-mogul gave us an inside look at life in the fab lane.

“I’m so excited for your to see my LA” Bensimon tells Page Six as the day kicks off. “Let’s go!”

Chic stay

Sunset Marquis 1200 Alta Loma Rd. West Hollywood Calif. 20069

Bensimon always likes to stay at the iconic Sunset Marquis Hotel which became a favorite of hers during the height of her modeling career in the ‘80s and ‘90s.

“I used to run into Bono from U2 and Elton John! This really was the place to be. And it still is! It’s very nostalgic but feels chic and new at the same time” she says over coffee in one of the hotel’s many lush outdoor spaces.

“I’ve always stayed here.”

The reality star says she spent a few nights at the Sunset Marquis during Oscars weekend in March during which she felt particularly glamorous. “I was walking down the stairs in my long red dress and I was like ‘This reminds me of when I was younger’” she says. “And it was fun!”

Benismon notes she feels like a “different person” in LA versus New York City.

“Listen I love New York and I’ve lived there for so many years. I raised my girls there” she says. “But just the quality of life is different and people are just friendly.”

When she’s in town Bensimon loves catching up with her good pal and “Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” star Sutton Stracke.

“I’m really good friends with Sutton. I love Sutton so much. I love her because she is genuinely interested and a great mom and a really good friend” she shares adding that she “just met Kyle [Richards]” this year too.

Asked if she’d ever consider moving to LA for a role on “RHOBH” Bensimon played coy. “Anything could happen!” she says with a laugh. “Who knows?”

Fabulous facials

Nathan Newman M.D. 9301 Wilshire Blvd #303 Beverly Hills Calif. 90120

Bensimon says her “first stop” in LA is always the Beverly Hills office of plastic surgeon Dr. Nathan Newman — a pioneer in stem cell therapy — who is renowned for his stem cell facials.

“These stem [cell] facials are unbelievable. I’m serious my skin has never looked better” she says. “The stem really hydrates my skin and is removing some of the wrinkles not all of them.”

Bensimon loves that the procedure hydrates her face rather than freezing it like other noninvasive cosmetic procedures. “I’m like ‘Listen I spent a long time smiling. Do not take away those memories’” she says giving fine lines and wrinkles a sweet rebrand.

12 Bensimon introduced us to Dr. Newman who gave us one of his famous skincare treatments.

After being introduced to Dr. Newman he told me to get ready for a “facial like [I’ve] never had before” — and he was right. It was transformative.

The relaxing hourlong treatment — which uses his plant-based stem cell serums — gave my skin an instant refresh and dewy glow.

Bensimon says she relies on Dr. Nathan whenever she finds herself in an epidermal crisis.

“My first [stem cell facial] was literally right after BravoCon [2023]” she recalls. “I was exhausted and so I came to Dr. Nathan Newman and I was like ‘I am so haggard. I’m feeling like not myself I’m feeling like totally someone else.’ And I had the facial and I’m telling you I was just like ‘Woah.’”

Trendy treats

Erewhon 339 N. Beverly Dr. Beverly Hills Calif. 90210

As Angelenos are well aware Erewhon is the grocery store to the stars — including Bensimon — so we made a visit to the Beverly Hills outpost.

“I started going to Erewhon because my oldest daughter [Sea Louise] was like ‘You have got to try these smoothies they are over the top’” she says of the 26-year-old’s assessment of the Erewhon’s tentpole creations.

12 We made a stop at Erewhon where Bensimon loves to fuel up on their smoothies.

Celebrities like Hailey Bieber Winnie Harlow Sofia Richie Molly Simms and Dr. Paul Nassif have signature smoothies on the menu but Bensimon prefers to procure her own blend.

For the both of us she ordered smoothies packed with greens greek yogurt and cayenne pepper that she raved would “jumpstart our metabolisms” as swimsuit season approaches.

Yes please!

‘Real Housewife’ of real estate

21056 Las Flores Mesa Dr. Malibu Calif. 90265

Bensimon — a broker with Douglas Elliman who has sold hundreds of millions of dollars in real estate since obtaining her license as an agent in 2019 — was particularly thrilled to explore her seaside listing at 21056 Las Flores Mesa Dr. with Page Six in tow.

“I just feel like this is a beautiful beautiful property. It has heritage it’s in Malibu Calif. it’s one of a kind” she says of the 3-bedroom 3-bathroom manse designed by celebrated architect Harry Gesner and built in 1997.

12 “It’s very ‘007’ very cinematic” the Bravolebrity raves. Page Six

12 She even showed us the furnished airstream outside — where she also took a break to sing an original tune inspired by the palatial property.

“He’s known for the wood and also the brick. He loves that juxtaposition. It’s very ‘007’ very cinematic” she elaborates acknowledging that the owners’ interior design choices were inspired by their love of the “James Bond” films.

Bensimon also points out the “stunning views” of the Pacific Ocean visible through the home’s cathedral-like windows from the pool and even from a furnished airstream located in the backyard.

“For me real estate just resonates so much because I love art and architecture so much” she tells Page Six. “My favorite part of the job outside of the aesthetic is making sure that my clients have what they need and what they want. That is very rewarding.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNmZ2F0ZS5jb20vcmVhbGVzdGF0ZS9hcnRpY2xlL21hZ2ljYWwtdHJlZWhvdXNlLWxpa2UtaG9tZS1vYWtsYW5kLWhpbGxzLTE5NDUxMDQzLnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Magical' $1.8M treehouse-like home in the Oakland Hills for sale,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sfgate.com/realestate/article/magical-treehouse-like-home-oakland-hills-19451043.php on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNmZ2F0ZS5jb20vcmVhbGVzdGF0ZS9hcnRpY2xlL21hZ2ljYWwtdHJlZWhvdXNlLWxpa2UtaG9tZS1vYWtsYW5kLWhpbGxzLTE5NDUxMDQzLnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDI0LzUvMTAvMjQxNTM4OTIvdmVyaXpvbi10bW9iaWxlLWF0dC11bmxpbWl0ZWQtcGxhbi1mcmVlLXBob25lLW9mZmVycy1maW5l0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Verizon AT&T and T-Mobile's “unlimited” plans just got a $10M slap on the wrist,"Verizon AT&T and T-Mobile will pay a combined $10.22 million to a group of states to settle claims that the carriers lied to customers about their “unlimited” plans and “free” phone offers. The settlement which follows an investigation from a coalition of 50 attorneys general requires the three companies to make their advertisements more transparent.

Under the terms of the agreement Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T can only advertise their plans as “unlimited” if there are no limits on how much data someone can use during a billing cycle. The ads must “clearly and conspicuously” say that restrictions on speed may apply as well as specify the amount of data customers can use before triggering the slowdown.

Additionally the attorneys general went after the allegedly misleading claims Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T made in ads promising to “pay” customers to switch carriers. All three companies must now clearly disclose the terms and conditions associated with the offer including how much a customer will be paid and when they will receive their payment. The carriers must also disclose the requirements customers must meet to receive “free” phone offers along with any hidden fees.

“AT&T Verizon and T-Mobile lied to millions of consumers making false promises of free phones and ‘unlimited’ data plans that were simply untrue” New York Attorney General Letitia James says in a statement. “Big companies are not excused from following the law and cannot trick consumers into paying for services they will never receive.”

Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T will also have to appoint a “dedicated representative” to field customer complaints. The three companies deny any wrongdoing. “These voluntary agreements reflect no finding of improper conduct and reaffirm the wireless industry’s longstanding commitment to clarity and integrity in advertising so that consumers can make informed decisions about the products and services that best suit them” Nick Ludlum the senior vice president of the CTIA the trade group representing the carriers tells The Verge.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvcmFyZS1taWNoYWVsLWpvcmRhbi1jYXJkLWNvdWxkLWZldGNoLTVtLWF1Y3Rpb24ta2VuLWdvbGRpbi1yZXZlYWxzLTEwMC1iZXN0LWNvbGxlY3RpYmxlc9IBggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3hidXNpbmVzcy5jb20vbGlmZXN0eWxlL3JhcmUtbWljaGFlbC1qb3JkYW4tY2FyZC1jb3VsZC1mZXRjaC01bS1hdWN0aW9uLWtlbi1nb2xkaW4tcmV2ZWFscy0xMDAtYmVzdC1jb2xsZWN0aWJsZXMuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rare Michael Jordan card could fetch $5M at auction: Ken Goldin reveals '100 best collectibles',"Goldin Auction’s second annual Goldin 100 event displays the rarest and most valuable collectibles of the year.

Ten years after authorities finish deconstructing the 9/11-damaged Deutsche Bank Building the southern part of its footprint remains undeveloped in 2021 as plans for the construction of a future Five World Trade Center tower await approval from several governmental agencies. The Lower Manhattan Development Corporation retains ownership of the land parcel known as site 5 which is bounded by Washington Albany and Greenwich streets.

After the National September 11 Memorial plaza opens to the public in September 2011 LMDC allows the southern portion of site 5 to be used as a waiting area for ticketed visitors to the plaza which is surrounded by a fence. The site 5 waiting area is vacated on May 15 2014 when a dedication ceremony is held for the National September 11 Museum and the Memorial plaza’s fence is removed giving visitors free access to the plaza for the first time.

LMDC decides to develop the vacated southern portion of site 5 into a temporary park as part of a project with Downtown Alliance a nonprofit group that advocates for Lower Manhattan businesses. The park opens to the public on September 2 2014. Named Albany Street Plaza it features benches trees and a colorful mural on a wall separating it from a police command post.

LMDC allows the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to builds trailers on the northern portion of site 5 in 2014. The trailers contain office space for the Port Authority Police’s World Trade Center Command which moves into the temporary facility on April 24 of that year.

In a major step toward realizing the vision of a 5 WTC tower New York Governor Andrew Cuomo LMDC and the Port Authority issue a request for proposals on June 26 2019 seeking plans from developers to either lease or purchase the site for the construction of a commercial or mixed-use building.

LMDC and the Port Authority decide on February 11 2021 to enter into exclusive negotiations with a consortium of developers that proposes to lease the site and build a largely residential tower. The 99-year lease would require the developers to pay rent directly to the Port Authority.

The consortium is led by U.S. firm Silverstein Properties and Canadian-owned firm Brookfield Properties and includes two smaller New York-based firms Omni New York and Dabar Development Partners.

The Port Authority tells VOA that negotiations with the consortium on finalizing the lease for a future 5 WTC continue through August with no word on when they are likely to conclude.

New Saint Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church & National Shrine

Almost 20 years after the original church is destroyed on 9/11 construction of a new Saint Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church and National Shrine nears completion at a nearby site in August 2021. It is designed by Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava whom the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America first commissioned to draw up plans for the new building in 2012.

Calatrava’s design released in 2013 envisions a domed white marble building surrounded by four pillars modeled on Istanbul’s Hagia Sophia and Church of the Holy Savior in Chora two iconic former Greek Orthodox churches later converted into mosques by Turkish authorities in 2020. Located at 130 Liberty Street on the eastern side of the World Trade Center’s new Liberty Park construction of the estimated $20 million project begins with a ground-breaking ceremony on October 18 2014 and reaches a “topping out” stage with a temporary cross placed on the building’s skeletal dome on November 29 2016.

The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey which agreed to let the archdiocese rebuild the church at 130 Liberty Street as part of a 2011 land swap agreement signs another deal on August 21 2017 to lease the site to the archdiocese for 198 years. The new agreement sets the rent for the church-shrine at a nominal $1 per year and gives the archdiocese the option to buy the site at any time during the lease also for a nominal fee. The archdiocese agrees to let the Port Authority maintain ownership of the site so that the governmental agency retains responsibility for securing permits and regulatory approvals during the construction process.

But building work stops in December 2017 when Swedish construction company Skanska says the archdiocese is not paying it. The archdiocese reveals months earlier that it is in a severe financial deficit that has been building for years and hires PricewaterhouseCoopers in April 2018 to investigate the church-shrine project’s finances and major cost overruns.

The investigators conclude in October 2018 that there is no evidence of fraud or improper usage of funds by archdiocese members. The archdiocese also accepts the investigators’ call for the creation of a new independent entity “Friends of Saint Nicholas” to raise funds to complete the stalled project.

The Friends of Saint Nicholas group raises millions of additional dollars from private donations enabling construction to resume on August 3 2020. Total raised funds reach $95 million in June 2021 almost five times the original projected cost of the rebuilding.

In a statement to VOA the archdiocese says the church-shrine’s exterior is expected to be completed by the evening of September 10 2021 when it will be illuminated from the inside for the first time.

The archdiocese says that while interior work continues into 2022 an opening of the doors ceremony called a thyranoixia will be held on November 2 2021 to coincide with a New York visit of Turkey-based Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9wZW5wci5jb20vbmV3cy8yMzg5MzEzL2FwYXJ0bWVudC1ob3RlbC1tYXJrZXQtaXMtZGF6emxpbmctd29ybGR3aWRlLXdpdGgtYWNjb3ItaG90ZWxz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Apartment Hotel Market Is Dazzling Worldwide with Accor Hotels Extended Stay America Marriott International,"Apartment Hotel Market Is Dazzling Worldwide with Accor Hotels Extended Stay America Marriott International

Some of the most heart-tugging moments of Saturday’s 9/11 commemoration came when young children — all born long after the deaths of the grandparents they wished to honor — stood at the podium to help read out the names of the terror attack’s nearly 3000 victims.

“For my grandfather Michael San Phillip” Charlotte Spero told the crowd of mourners on the 9/11 Memorial Plaza in lower Manhattan as she paid tribute to her grandfather an investment banker who worked in the South Tower.

“Who I was never able to meet but I’m pretty sure we would have had a lot of fun together” she said with a smile.

Mina Clemente 9 had a special request for her grandfather Cesar Amoranto Alviar an accountant with Marsh & McLennan.

“Thank you for watching over us” the little girl said. “And please convince Mommy to get us a husky someday.”

“She totally surprised me with the dog thing” Mina’s mother Gemma Alviar told The Post. “OK no pressure there saying that on national television — I guess we have to deliver.”

Emma Bowie made a promise to her grandfather Martin John Coughlan a carpenter who happened to be doing renovation work in the towers that day.

12 9/11 victim Michael V. San Phillip worked as an investment banker. 12 9/11 victim Martin John Coughlan was working as a carpenter in the Towers.

“I will always carry on your legacy and spirit” she vowed. “I’ll never forget you.”

Amanda Froehlich had high praise for her grandfather Philip T. Hayes the World Trade Center’s fire safety director who was killed soon after he saved children from a day-care center in the complex.

12 World Trade Center Deputy Fire Safety Director Philip T. Hayes died at the age of 67. 12 9/11 victim David Francis Ferrugio was a bond broker.

12 9/11 victim Cesar Amoranto Alviar was 60.

“You will always be my hero” Amanda said. “I’ve heard so many amazing stories about you and you are such a great role model as my grandpa.”

But Jake DiVirgilio’s simple words said it all when he spoke of his grandfather bond broker David Francis Ferrugio.

“We all miss you” the young boy said as he strained to reach the microphone. “And even though I didn’t get to meet you I still love you.”

Jeffrey Bittner 27 and David Winton 29 were friends and worked together at Keefe Bruyett & Woods in the south tower of the World Trade Center. They grew up playing youth sports in Wethersfield. Dick Keane who worked for Marsh McLennan and was at a meeting that day most likely on the 99th floor of the north tower was a youth sports coach for his children and countless others in town. Dick coached David and Jeffrey in Little League. Winton’s and Bittner’s mothers were close childhood friends.

“The Wintons and the Keanes and the Bittners — all the kids were around the same age and they were all involved [in sports]” said Pam Bittner Jeffrey’s twin sister. “Dick Keane was a soccer coach. [David]’s dad was a soccer coach. [David]’s family and my family our moms were best friends and in each other’s weddings.”

The lives of their families were irrevocably changed that day. It is also when three women Pam Bittner Judy Keane Dick’s widow and Sara Winton Coffey David’s sister decided they needed to make a difference in the world.

“I was living in Westport at the time” Sara said. “I just wanted to do something that was more meaningful in my life. Dave was 29. I was 25 at the time. Dave was very generous just like Jeff. I felt that need to leave an impression.”

Remembering the fallen

The soccer players stood in rows last Saturday silent as 10-year-old Jaclyn Coffey Sara’s daughter and David’s niece sang “God Bless America”. It was a beautiful sunny day at Wethersfield High School perfect weather for the Winton-Keane-Bittner Soccer Jamboree which started in 2002.

Youth soccer players lined up with their tiny cleats and shin guards fidgeting during the moment of silence.

“The day after Sept. 11 a lot of families and friends reached out to us” Sara said to the crowd. “Perfect strangers reached out to us some with the last name Winton we had never met. We still talk to them and maintain relationships.”

High school teams from Wethersfield where David and Sara played soccer Kingswood-Oxford where Jeffrey Bittner played lacrosse football and ice hockey and Staples where Scott Coleman of Westport who also died in the World Trade Center played his freshman year and others gathered to play before the high school season started. Riley Keane Dick and Judy’s granddaughter was there with the Wethersfield girls team.

“I ask that with this memorial coming up that you reach out to perfect strangers that you show kindness in the smallest way a smile a wave a helping hand” Sara told the crowd. “That is the best tribute for our family members and all of those lost on Sept. 11.”

The night of Sept. 10 2001 Judy was stressed because she had to bake and she didn’t like baking. She had started working as a nursing instructor at Capital Community College and it was her turn to bring goodies the following day. She had made three apple cakes.

Naturally Dick wanted to sample one.

“He said ‘Oh which one’s for me?'” Judy said. “I said ‘None of them. I have to make sure the best one goes to school.’ That night before I went to bed I felt guilty because he went to bed early. He was leaving at 5 in the morning to go to New York. I wrote him a little note ‘OK. You can have this one.’ He wrote me back a note saying ‘Thank you. Loved it it was great. I love you.’ That was my last contact with him.”

That morning Judy was at a long-term care facility in Waterbury when she heard a patient cry out “Oh my God! Oh my God!”

Judy a nurse consultant went to check on the patient thinking she had fallen out of bed. The patient was pointing at the TV. Judy saw a plane sticking out of a tall building. The caption read: New York City.

Judy assumed Dick was in his mid-town Manhattan office so she wasn’t really worried about what she had seen on TV. She called him anyways and left a message. “Just come home. New York is going to be crazy today. Get out and just come home.’ “

“I had to go to another meeting in Wallingford” she said last week. “I left for that. On the way I heard the second building had been hit. I knew we were under attack. So I called again.

“‘You know what? It’s a mess. Just come home. I need you there with me.'”

Pam Bittner was on the phone with her brother Jeff at 8:48 a.m. The twins talked to each other every morning.

“He told me not to panic” said Pam who lives in Plymouth Mass. “He said a small plane or what they thought was a small plane had hit the building next to them. They told him not to leave the building. They were secure. They needed to focus on making sure everybody was evacuating the other tower.”

They hung up. Pam turned on the TV. She called him right back. He answered and she told him to get out. He said he was leaving the building.

She called her father and as the two of them watched at 9:03 a.m. the second plane hit the south tower. Jeffrey and David worked on the 89th floor.

“I never heard from him again” Pam said.

Like Pam Sara talked to her brother after the first plane hit.

He reassured her that he was fine then said “I gotta go.” Sara heard an announcement in the background.

“He always said ‘I gotta go’ when he was busy at work. It didn’t sound any different” Sara said. “What it was was he saw the plane coming at his window. And he was trying to run.

“He was able to get away and was able to call my mother and his fiancée after that happened. He said ‘I had to hang up on Sara because the plane was coming at my window.’ He told my mom he was going to try to get out and we may not hear from him for a while.

“We held out hope for a long time. He was a guy who get through a crisis. He was athletic. We had confidence that if anybody could find a way out he could do it and would be helping everybody along the way.”

Giving back to the community

David graduated from Wethersfield High in 1990 where he was a captain his senior year for both soccer and baseball. He went to Fordham graduating in 1994 and became a financial analyst.

“Dave’s friends came up with this idea to do a jamboree in his name” Sara said. “Jeff played soccer for my dad. Judy’s son Tim played soccer for my dad.

“There’s so many memories on this field. I blew my knee out on this field. So many memories whether good bad or in between. I was brought to every single one of my brother’s games. I remember him on this field.”

There are scholarships in David’s name at Wethersfield High and at Fordham.

Jeffrey Bittner grew up playing youth soccer in Wethersfield and went to Kingswood-Oxford but didn’t play soccer. His junior year the football coach asked him to go out for the team because he was such a good athlete his sister said so he did. He went to Middlebury College and also studied at Oxford in England in 1994. He was a research analyst at Keefe Bruyett & Woods.

“After my brother was killed we started to raise money for educational resources for at risk kids in New York City” Pam said. “That turned into also providing educational resources for those with resource restrictions at Kingswood-Oxford and Middlebury College.”

Pam said that Jeffrey was committed to one day working in philanthropy and he was passionate about education.

“He was an excellent student” she said. “He was very driven very focused. We knew that when we were a little more clear-headed and able to process things was that we needed to raise money to support those programs and initiatives he found so important in his life.”

Dick Keane Judy said was forever complaining that there weren’t enough basketball courts in town. He was a runner and also enjoyed playing pickup basketball.

“That was our goal to have another gym so there would be one more court” Judy said.

Judy started the Richard M. Keane Foundation after her husband’s death. The foundation has funded after-school programs for Wethersfield children as well as the building of the 9/11 Memorial Sports Center which was finished in 2008.

There are two pieces of steel from the World Trade Center at the sports center one outside and one on the back wall of the gym.

“I wasn’t sure I wanted it in there where kids were going to play” Judy said. “The steelworkers raised it up and said. ‘Yea or nay?’ It looked like a fish. It looks like a whale. I said ‘Oh my gosh it’s very gentle. It’s like a piece of sculpture.’ It went up.”

Dick she said would have loved it.

“He would be thrilled we’ve done something good in his name that it affects kids sports” she said. “And the basketball court he wished for.”

Over the 50 years of its history Dubai -and the UAE as a whole- has succeeded in achieving goals that have wowed the world and the upcoming Expo 2020 Dubai will surely be no exception. The six-month-long mega event starting in October this year promises to reimagine visitor experiences as we know it and Mastercard the globally renowned innovator and technology leader in payments has been put in charge of one particular aspect of this commitment to greatness- to ensure a seamless and cashless payment experience for the over 25 million people expected to be a part of it.

According to Khalid Elgibali Division President – MENA Mastercard his company's appointment as Expo 2020 Dubai's Official Payment Technology Partner was a natural consequence of the two entities aiming to find new ways ""to connect everyone to priceless opportunities."" ""As the Official Payment Technology Partner of the event Mastercard will be showcasing the latest in payment technologies and tools that are changing the way that people pay shop and connect with each other"" Elgibali says. ""We've planned an immersive experience for all Expo visitors so that they can not only see but truly be a part of the transformation that we're experiencing now. In addition we will be bringing to the forefront the most relevant concerns pressing us today on a global platform and exploring solutions for these in collaboration with our partners.""

Leading Mastercard's efforts in this arena will be Elgibali who is well-versed in the MENA region's financial landscape not only because of his role at the helm of his company's evolving regional network but also due to the wealth of experience he gained by previously holding several senior positions at the region's leading banking institutions. His steely confidence in digital payments thus stems from this extensive expertise but Elgibali notes that even difficult periods such as the ongoing COVID-19 crisis offer proof that the so-called ""future of payments"" is not near but already here. ""From our learnings from the pandemic we have realized just how powerful digital payments are in ensuring the continuity of commerce especially for small and medium enterprises which have suffered the most from the COVID-19 outbreak"" Elgibali explains. ""Hence Mastercard has a dedicated program that will be geared towards digital and financial inclusion of SMEs with a particular focus on women-owned SMEs.

Before we delve into the details of Mastercard's impressive commitment to provide small businesses with the financial tools technology products funding and data insights necessary to weather the COVID-19 crisis Elgibali emphasizes that Mastercard is ""a company that cares."" And it is for that reason its partnership with Expo 2020 Dubai encompasses not just payments but many other areas that matter a lot in today's world. One example of this is its Priceless Planet Coalition initiative which will employ a forest restoration model dedicated restoring of 100 million trees by 2025 of forests in geographies that represent the greatest global need. ""With climate change at the forefront of our minds Mastercard is making its Priceless Planet Coalition one of the pillars of our partnership having welcomed Expo 2020 Dubai Emirates NBD and Network International into our network to fight to preserve the environment"" Elgibali explains. ""What we're most excited about is the opportunity to bring this coalition to a global stage where every visitor attending Expo will be able to participate and contribute to saving the planet."" Expo 2020 Dubai will also give Elgibali and his team an opportunity to bring to life Mastercard's efforts in gender diversity and inclusion on an unprecedented scale. ""We will be a key player in the Expo Women's Pavilion and have committed significant resources to knowledge-sharing mentoring and fundraising initiatives for our women-focused programs across the world"" Elgibali says. ""Inclusion opportunity and the empowerment of girls and women are global priorities at Mastercard and we are truly excited to leave a long-standing legacy through our partnership.""

This follows Mastercard's Corporate Sustainability Report 2020 which presented its activities in four areas (inclusive growth people and culture environmental stewardship and ethical and responsible standards) all of which are geared towards delivering on the company's mission to build a more inclusive sustainable world with a digital economy that works for everyone everywhere. This report which was released in July 2021 notes that Mastercard has already achieved its goal of financially including 500 million people and that it is now planning to reach a total of 1 billion people by 2025. ""Amidst the many challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic for most small businesses our research also found that the impact on women entrepreneurs have been especially devastating given their over-representation in the worst-hit sectors"" Elgibali says. ""That's why we have pledged globally to connect 50 million small businesses to the digital economy by 2025 with a direct focus on supporting 25 million women entrepreneurs.""

While Mastercard's efforts in the sustainability realm is obviously widespread and touches the lives and livelihoods of hundreds of millions of people its focus on small businesses is especially noteworthy in this regard. According to Elgibali the impact of the COVID-19 crisis with its movement restrictions and a behavioral shift to contactless interactions has highlighted just how important it is for small businesses and micro merchants to have a digital presence to pay get paid and obtain capital. ""Mastercard is committed to empower every business through our technology insights and global expertise"" Elgibali says. ""We've created products and solutions to unlock potential and keep SMEs moving forward. Additionally we have pledged assistance of $250 million globally to support SMEs with digital tools and training during the pandemic.""

With Mastercard aiming to address sustainability in the digital economy by helping move businesses at the margins to digital growth into the mainstream Elgibali believes the company's extensive experience with financial inclusion makes it uniquely suited to lead at this critical inflection point. ""Mastercard is locking arms with trusted industry partners governments and banks to empower every business"" he says. ""We're democratizing access to solutions that have long been the domain of larger corporations and building commercially sustainable and scalable social impact products and programs for SMEs. We're also providing free access to tools education and timely insights to help them secure and enable their digital worlds. These include the Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth which is working with grantees around the world to help address the challenges facing micro-businesses during the COVID-19 crisis including digital training sanitation kits online mentoring and access to working capital.""

At Mastercard MENA Elgibali's niche expertise is focused on three areas: business growth emerging technology payment opportunities and business alliances with key partners and stakeholders. His daily insights deriving out of these duties assure him that Mastercard is clearly redefining the future of payments. ""Through our digital-first strategy we are working to serve our partners as a single technology provider of choice that connects telcos digital retailers and fintech companies to their customers"" Elgibali says. ""We are providing technology solutions platforms and propositions that enable a superior digital experience simplify adoption of innovation and drive greater inclusion for people across the globe.""

At this point Elgibali notes that Mastercard's offering of cutting-edge solutions is thanks to the enterprise's historical insistence on always enhancing its own capabilities through the introduction of innovative products strong partnership programs with innovators and acquisitions of industry-leading companies. This commitment to excellence he continues originally began with Mastercard's acquisition of real-time payments provider Vocalink in 2017 which is currently transforming the payments infrastructure in economic hubs around the world including Saudi Arabia Singapore Thailand and the UK. This was then accelerated through the acquisitions of Transfast a global cross-border payments network provider as well as Nets Corporate Services which allows consumers to get a payment platform for recurring bill and credit transfer transactions to more than 250000 corporate companies.

Such transactions are an indication of Mastercard's belief that its commitment to connecting 50 million SMEs globally to the digital economy by 2025 will surely enhance its own innovative capabilities in the years to come. At the same time it is also this focus on the future that is underlining Mastercard's efforts at keeping sustainability as a key point of consideration when going about its day-to-day business. ""As I mentioned the Priceless Planet Coalition has been established as one of our flagship initiatives to promote sustainability in the UAE and wider region"" Elgibali explains. ""By building a network of strategic partners that include heavyweights such as HSBC Emirates NBD Emirates Islamic Network International we are rallying efforts to make a difference within the communities we operate in. Simultaneously we have also pledged net zero emissions from our operations by 2050 on a global scale. We continue to work with our partners here and across the world to realize this vision.""

Meanwhile the Mastercard New Payments Index a global survey about omni-channel commerce payment shifts and consumer behavior trends post the COVID-19 crisis has pointed out the rising adoption of new payment technologies and growing consumer appetite for new fast and flexible digital experiences. ""SMEs must adapt to a hybrid environment where omni-channel payment strategies and choice are key"" Elgibali says adding that consumers across the MENA region have also irreversibly embraced new and emerging payment methods. ""95% of MEA consumers will consider using at least one emerging payment method such as cryptocurrency biometrics contactless or QR code over the next year"" he says. ""61% of MENA consumers say they would avoid businesses that do not accept electronic payments of any kind. Three in four UAE consumers say that digital payment methods help them save money. These are not small numbers and hence indicate a permanent change in the years to come.""

Examples of Mastercard's support to small businesses across the MENA region to grow digitally include its SME-in-a-Box solution a one-stop solution that helps business owners build their online platforms and sell their products and service through e-commerce. There's also Simplify Commerce an offering which allows SMEs to make use of a plug-and-play e-commerce store builder that offers an instant online checkout. Another solution Mastercard is championing is Click to Pay which removes the friction of entering card details each time a shopper wishes to checkout and with it being rolled out to businesses of all sizes it promises to become the gold standard of tomorrow's shopping experience. Elgibali also points out Mastercard's work in expanding Tap-On-Phone technologies within the MENA region which makes use of contactless technology to turn a smartphone into a payment acceptance device and thus becoming a powerful and cost-effective tool for small businesses to quickly be able to accept digital payments in line with consumer expectations.

Elgibali adds that one part of the region's digital economy that is maturing very quickly is its fintech ecosystem with the MEA region already having over 1200 fintech players covering everything from credit and insurance to wealth management offered through a centralized cloud-based platform. ""Recognizing the important role fintech companies play in the world's rapid digital transformation Mastercard is continuously diversifying its business by diversifying its perspective: looking to new partners new markets and new ways to build on its core competency as a payments network"" he says. ""We're engaging in multiple strategic partnerships with innovators regulators and financial institutions to enhance the ecosystem and support the growth of capabilities like open banking in the region."" According to Elgibali Mastercard's Fintech Express and Engage Programs which are designed to build a network of partnerships are proof of the company's support to fintech innovation boosting financial inclusion and enhancing the payment experience for consumers.

Given this landscape Elgibali notes that while digital transformation and the digital economy are evolving rapidly cybersecurity remains a growing issue- and especially so for entrepreneurial businesses. ""That is why we protect and secure SMEs in the accelerated shift to digital"" he says. ""Considering nearly one in five small businesses experience cyber-attacks or data breaches we provide the tools and solutions they need to secure every interaction. The Global Cyber Alliance and Mastercard released the free online Cybersecurity Toolkit to arm small business owners with basic security controls and guidance operational tools how-to materials and recognized best practices to protect themselves from ever-evolving cyber risks.""

Another type of this kind of support is Mastercard's free online Cyber Readiness Program a free practical step-by-step guide for SMEs focused on four critical cyber issues: authentication and passwords software updates phishing and USBs and removable media. ""Mastercard is constantly adapting by creating new programs and partnerships to empower digital transformation create diversification and accelerate the emergence of new market players"" Elgibali adds. ""In MENA we partnered with Hub71 to accelerate innovation in the UAE's fintech startup community. The partnership identifies relevant companies for Mastercard Start Path opening up market access for Hub71's startups and Start Path companies– for mutual benefit. We've also invested in UAE-based Network International which is growing a presence in Saudi Arabia having been included in an innovation sandbox created by the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority.""

This leads into his top tips for entrepreneurs in the region. ""My advice to businesses would be three-fold: be aware of the latest tools and technologies available to you utilize them to your advantage and keep your eyes laser-focused on what your customers want from you which is the only way to be truly successful and sustainable"" Elgibali says. In conclusion Elgibali points toward Mastercard's inaugural Middle East and Africa SME Confidence Index released in June 2021 which has shown that 88% of SMEs in the UAE are optimistic about the following year with two-thirds (66%) projecting revenues that would either grow or hold steady. ""SMEs in the MENA have identified better data and insights training and upskilling staff and access to digital training and development support as the top drivers for growth"" says Elgibali reiterating the importance of digital transformation and human capital for the future growth of any business.

But Elgibali stresses that the MENA region is currently moving through a fascinating moment in its history with many regional countries making great advances in non-oil economic diversification and investing in so-called ""giga-projects"" and events like Expo 2020 Dubai- and all of that is setting up the region as a great place to do business in right now. ""There is a narrative of investment diversity inclusive growth and competitiveness that is tangible– and it can be seen right across the region"" Elgibali concludes. ""If you look at the volume of SMEs coming to the fore you get a sense of how communities are thinking and what the next generation is feeling about its potential.""

The Executive Summary: Tips for entrepreneurs from Khalid Elgibali Division President – MENA Mastercard

Always keep your end consumer in mind ""It is necessary to approach your product or service from the viewpoint of the end-consumer. Every organization today is a B2C organization not a B2B or a B2G because ultimately the work you do will have a considerable impact on individual lives. It is that impact that you must look to positively transform to achieve exponential innovation.""

Work on building a sustainable business ""The first thing would be to look internally and invest in those technologies and solutions that aim to disrupt existing technologies– you could call this futureproofing. In the era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence internet of things machine learning robotic process automation and blockchain provide us with the best tools possible to futureproof our operations.""

Your competitors could become your partners ""I would suggest that entrepreneurs view other startups not as competition but as potential strategic partners that can help them achieve exponential innovation. Looking at the positive sentiment that Careem and Souq received this past year after being acquired is a clear indication that the region is increasingly becoming a hotbed of unicorn startups and it makes business sense to leverage this opportunity.""

Don't go at it alone- look for collaborations ""You can see superb examples in the MENA region of popular apps which enable consumers to purchase their food travel and clothing anytime and anywhere simply from their smartphones. For this to happen several stakeholders need to work together. The app itself needs to ensure that the consumer has an easy-to-understand user experience that allows them to make the purchase seamlessly.""

Keep inventing keep innovating ""Smart Dubai recently stated that the number of things connected to the internet surpassed the number of humans and that it is expected to reach 20.4 billion by 2020. The boundaries of technologies continue to expand and there has never been a better time in history for innovators to experiment build and test new solutions.""

Our writers — who were covering three of the matches — look back at what happened…

Real Mallorca vs Arsenal Group C September 11

David Seaman went into his hotel room picked up the remote control and started flicking through the channels hoping to find anything watchable to pass the time before Arsenal’s first Champions League game of the season. Match-day preparations for away fixtures always followed the same schedule. Manager Arsene Wenger liked his players to go through a stretching routine in the morning then have a meal and go back to their rooms for a rest before reconvening later in the afternoon.

“I put the TV on and it was just Spanish channels so I couldn’t really understand it” goalkeeper Seaman recalls. “I could see this tower burning. I was trying to figure it out. I swear as I was looking at it that’s exactly when the second plane hit the second tower. I thought it was a clip from a movie. It was too unbelievable. When it dawned on me that it was real it was hard to know what to do. It was so horrible to watch. You start thinking of the people who were in the towers. The TV pictures were fixed on live events and showed everything. We could see people jumping out of the building. Oh my god.”

Arsenal were in Palma on the day of 9/11. Their hosts Real Mallorca were Champions League debutants. It was lunchtime in Spain on a day that felt like one of those almost-perfect away trips — beautiful late-summer warmth lovely food a new stadium to tick off — when news began to spread about atrocities so extreme it was an attack on humanity itself. Arsenal’s directors were in a restaurant close to the beach when Danny Fiszman’s phone rang. Mobile communication was much more rudimentary in those days so there was no internet at the touch of a button no app alerts just a call or a text message.

On the other end of the line was one of Fiszman’s relatives — a New Yorker. “Are you watching the news?” The voice down the end of the phone relayed the basic details. “I just wanted you to know that when you do see the news I’m OK.” Lunch was curtailed and Arsenal’s senior figures returned to their hotel to watch horrified the footage unfolding on their TV screens.

Versions of the same scene were being replicated in restaurants and bars across the city as word spread to the fans who had travelled to the Mediterranean island for the game. Miles Saward from Sport Options was used to arranging for groups to criss-cross Europe and beyond as a travel operator specialising in sporting events. Even though he had supporters of Hibernian and Manchester United on the move to Athens that same day (both clubs were due to play in Greece that week) as an Arsenal supporter he had chosen to accompany the trip to Mallorca instead. A busman’s holiday of sorts.

“I was at a bar watching the news like probably everyone else somewhere in the world” he remembers. “I felt sick. The Marriott which was under the World Trade Centre had been reduced to rubble and we had stayed there. We had a lot of people for Lennox Lewis vs Evander Holyfield at Madison Square Garden not that long before. We used that hotel. We had about 400 people in there. Fuck. It was so eerie.

“I started getting these vague messages that all international flights would be grounded.” Saward felt responsible for the 200 people he had brought to Mallorca for the game plus those heading to Greece. Quite apart from the logistics he couldn’t face going to the Arsenal match. It felt somehow immoral.

David Miles was Arsenal’s club secretary. He had been at lunch with the directors and as soon as he returned to the hotel he got in touch with the UEFA representatives and venue director to find out what was going on. His first thought — and the thought of many — was that their game and all games would be called off. “The venue director told me he was in touch with UEFA HQ — because they don’t do anything unless it is cleared by Nyon. A little later I got a call back to let us know all the games were going ahead.” Even reflecting on it now the shock at the decision still reverberates. Miles takes a deep breath and his voice carries that same disbelief he felt on the day. “‘Really…?’ It did seem strange after something so horrific to think football must go on.”

UEFA instructed there should be a minute’s silence at all matches but otherwise clubs were ordered to go on as normal. “We were advised there could be more security issues and problems if we postponed” a UEFA spokesman explained. ”We took the decision that there should be a minute’s silence to show respect but recognised that at an advanced stage of preparations the games should go ahead.”

“I let everyone know at our end” Miles continues. “I told Arsene from a team point of view. We had to talk to our travel people. Because the towers had gone down there was a sense that this could happen to other targets around the world. Canary Wharf (a 770ft — 235m — office building in London) for example could have been a target. We looked into landing the charter (flight back to the UK) outside the London area because of concerns about the air space around London. Even as late as during the game we were taking calls about the logistics and possibilities. The team were not aware of the background conversations we didn’t want to unsettle them any more than the case already by telling them we might not fly back tonight.”

Seaman explains how it is for players even in the most unusual circumstances. What you feel what you want gets suppressed. “It was hard to focus on the game” he says. “This was a major incident in the world and that was obvious. But as a player you have to wait for a decision you have to wait for the authorities. Players are used to being told what to do. We were told it was going ahead and we had to play. We had to switch our minds to player mode and try to do our job.”

Lauren Arsenal’s right-back says the club tended to try to protect the players as a matter of course: “I couldn’t believe that America the most secure country in the world could have that security broken so easily. It did not seem possible. But as players we didn’t talk about it. Wenger always tried to take the pressure off the team. The staff did not extrapolate their worry into us. We were in a kind of bubble. I tried to concentrate on the game.” The more profound thoughts would come later.

For the record Arsenal lost 1-0. Ashley Cole conceded a penalty and was sent off early on. While mindful that this was an unprecedented situation with no rules about how to behave it is bizarre to now read a match report from the time which focuses on the details of the game before mentioning the events of the day only in the final couple of paragraphs. “I bet there was not a player on the pitch who had not thought about what had happened that afternoon while they were playing” Seaman says. “It’s not often that you feel a match doesn’t mean anything. But in that scenario it didn’t. It’s a feeling I never experienced again and I never will. I don’t want to…” His voice trails off.

Miles remembers the atmosphere inside the stadium being strangely sombre and disconnected from normality. “Someone asked me afterwards what was the game like and I couldn’t tell them” he says. “ I couldn’t tune into it at all. It got totally glossed over.”

Saward was waiting outside the ground for the fans on the Sport Options trip to come out. “We had coaches going back to the airport and everyone was crowding around some shouting some not shouting some saying ‘Let him speak’. I do have that recall of absolute fear and trying to be calm for everyone. ‘What am I going to say?’ ‘If we can’t go home what are we going to do?’

“There are all sorts of bods around Arsenal. It is one of those clubs where people just know stuff. People were saying ‘You are definitely not getting out tonight what are you going to do?’ there were people who thought we were going to get shot down. It was a mad night. It was dramatic. It was a real moment wherever you were and whatever you were doing and we happened to be trying to get on an aeroplane a few hours after the attacks which was very surreal.”

On the runway the fans boarded their plane in total silence. Some were praying. Some were close to tears. Some were palpably struggling to keep calm. Saward did not even know if the flight would take off even as the doors closed. “I was in the cockpit with the pilot and co-pilot and they genuinely did not know if we would leave or not. We were waiting on the tarmac for an hour or so. Suddenly they got the nod. We had clearance to take off. We had to fly at lower altitude than normal to get back as quickly as possible. We must have been one of the last planes flying before they grounded all flights” he remembers. There was a panic mid-flight as their path took them through an electrical storm and with all the fear some people wondered if they could see bombs in the sky.

“When we landed” he recalls “everyone was grateful.”

Seaman still wonders why they played that awful day. UEFA’s reasoning was that it was too late to call off the games on the Tuesday night without any contingency for what to do with all the teams fans and delegations who had travelled. But they did postpone all football that week from then onwards. UEFA’s chief executive Gerhard Aigner explained how the governing body felt it was “right that the European football family should respect the loss and suffering now being felt by those families who have lost their loved ones by postponing all games scheduled to be played this week”.

Many from Arsenal wished the same had happened when they were asked to carry on at a time when nobody really wanted to play or watch sport. “Nothing of that magnitude had happened before in our lifetimes” says Seaman. “When they cancelled the rest of the Champions League games the next day I wondered why they didn’t act quicker for us. It was not the right way to go about things.”

Liverpool vs Boavista Group B September 11

For Liverpool it was supposed to be a red-letter day. There had been a few of those already in 2001 — putting the frustration of the 1990s behind them as they won the League Cup FA Cup and UEFA Cup finals in the space of three heady months — but for manager Gerard Houllier his players and the supporters there was a real significance to their long-awaited return to the European Cup stage.

This was not just Liverpool’s first campaign of the competition’s Champions League era. It was their first since their defeat by Juventus in a 1985 European Cup final overshadowed by the Heysel Stadium tragedy. Liverpool had been banned from European competition for six years — other English clubs for five years — as punishment for the hooliganism that culminated in tragedy at that final in Belgian capital Brussels.

Their return to Europe in the 1990s brought a succession of humbling experiences: knocked out of the UEFA Cup by Genoa Brondby and Celta Vigo and from the old Cup Winners’ Cup by Spartak Moscow and Paris Saint-Germain. On other occasions they missed out on European qualification altogether. Liverpool had been left behind so winning the UEFA Cup and then finally reaching the Champions League felt crucial in terms of prestige never mind finance.

At his pre-match press conference Houllier looked ahead with a sense of pride and excitement at being “back into the major competition” after such a long time. In his column in the match programme he said the visit of Portugal’s Boavista would make for a special night at Anfield.

“It had been hugely hyped” one Liverpool executive from that era recalls. “There had been such a big build-up. Even for us as officials it was a big step up from the other competitions. There had been a lot of excitement within the club. But it was rendered completely irrelevant by the ghastly things that were happening in the world that day.”

For Liverpool’s players the usual routine before an evening match at Anfield was to meet for lunch at a local hotel then go for a couple of hours’ sleep and relax before meeting again for their pre-match meal during the afternoon.

It didn’t work out like that at the Moat House hotel that day.

Some of the players drifted off to sleep quickly enough but others turned on the TV and were stunned by the news that was filtering through from New York. Defender Jamie Carragher recalls he slept first and then upon waking up was directed to the news channels. Others didn’t sleep at all either because they were watching the harrowing coverage or because having done so they were so horrified they couldn’t get what they had seen out of their minds.

Carragher says it was all he and his team-mates were talking about when they reconvened at the pre-match hotel. If there were any discussions about whether the match would go ahead they took place through chief executive Rick Parry and club secretary Bryce Morrison. The players were sheltered from any such discussions but not from the horrifying reality of events across the Atlantic.

A personal recollection is of walking into the press room at Anfield beforehand and seeing every journalist huddled around a TV watching in stunned silence. The usual small talk and airy chit-chat was abandoned. Then on heading up into the press box maybe 10 minutes for kick-off you were struck by the number of empty seats in the ground and the lack of crowd noise. Anfield would usually be raucous on a big European night. Not that night.

Carragher recalls the atmosphere was “weird”. Jorge Silva put Boavista ahead inside three minutes and whereas an early goal for the opposition would usually rouse the Anfield support into pumping up the volume the atmosphere that night remained flat. Michael Owen equalised on the half-hour but the game simply petered out towards a 1-1 draw in the second half.

Looking back it seems incongruous that there was a minor squabble between the managers afterwards. Boavista had seven players booked but their coach Jaime Pacheco blamed Liverpool for what he considered an over-zealous approach saying “We came here to play football not rugby. Compared to Liverpool we are not well endowed physically. We could have been massacred by some of their challenges.” Houllier disagreed saying his players were “strong and physical” but never excessively so.

Gary McAllister said a few days later that unlike some he didn’t feel the events in New York affected him for the simple reason that despite having spent the afternoon watching the TV coverage with room-mate Nick Barmby “the vastness had yet to register”. Had they been playing the following evening he would have found it more difficult because by then “the full significance had sunk in — and there was a need to show respect”.

Perhaps Houllier put it best reflecting later in the week that the game should not have taken place.

“If you don’t have that drive and desire to win the game there’s not much point in playing” he said. “At the end of the night a journalist wrote that a draw was the right result because no one would have wanted to celebrate. I agreed with that. No one had the heart to celebrate.”

Olympiakos vs Manchester United Group G September 12

It was Steve Curry one of the journalists who regularly covered Manchester United in those days who broke the news to Sir Alex Ferguson. We had just arrived at Athens airport. Ferguson had agreed to do his usual interview by the luggage carousel with the journalists who travelled alongside the team on their foreign excursions.

“Apparently a plane’s gone into the Twin Towers Alex.”

Ferguson wanted to know more. He asked if it was a light aircraft and we did not know. He remembered there had once been a freak accident that took a plane into another New York landmark the Empire State Building. But nobody really knew any more. So the tape recorders went on and his interview started.

He was on good form too. On the Saturday United had beaten Everton 4-1 at Old Trafford. Midfielder Juan Sebastian Veron had put on a masterclass and in the match-day programme that day the more observant readers might have noticed newly-signed Laurent Blanc’s face had been superimposed over Jaap Stam’s in the official team photograph. Centre-back Stam had been sold controversially two weeks earlier.

On the morning of September 11 United were flying into Greece to play Olympiakos the following day in their first Champions League group match of the 2001-02 campaign. The final that season was to be at Hampden Park in Glasgow and Ferguson was becoming irritated by the media narrative that he might lift the trophy in the city where he grew up.

“Some bloody idiot with a television camera has just come up to me asking about it” he growled. “I’m fed up listening to it all.”

It was he said in danger of becoming “an albatross” and it felt like a warning to all the journalists in his company that he wasn’t going to tolerate the same question being put to him before every Champions League game.

We changed the subject to talk about Veron’s mastery of the ball. Ferguson was just as effusive about Blanc and seemed surprised to learn it was going to be the first time the Frenchman had ever played in the Champions League. And there was a classic Ferguson put-down when he was told David O’Leary his Leeds United counterpart had said the decision to move out Stam to Lazio could cost him the European Cup. “What can I say?” Ferguson responded in his most dismissive tone. “I am only 60 after all.”

He ushered us away with the usual fond farewell — “away and write yer shite” — and the players were on their bus to the team hotel when the news came through about a second plane going into the World Trade Center’s other tower.

Fabien Barthez United’s France international goalkeeper heard about it first. He was dating supermodel Linda Evangelista a New York resident at the time. She had rung Barthez who was sitting at the back of the bus and the other players could see from his reaction that something serious had happened.

Barthez did not speak perfect English and that added to the confusion. But his voice was raised and he was unusually animated. Very soon the other players were huddled around him trying to find out more information taking in the news. Ferguson heard the commotion and walked down the aisle to the back of the coach.

In ordinary circumstances the players would have had a bit of lunch at their hotel and spent the afternoon resting in their rooms before travelling to the Olympic Stadium for a training session that evening.

These of course were not ordinary circumstances.

When the players arrived at their hotel they did not even check in before heading to a downstairs lounge that was showing the horrors unfold on rolling 24-7 news. Ferguson and all the coaching staff joined them. There was no Twitter at the time. But in those moments nobody needed it. Thirty maybe 40 people were gathered around one small television.

“I’ll never forget what we saw” says one player.

Back in Manchester United chairman Martin Edwards was going about his usual business.

“I was in my office” Edwards tells The Athletic. “I took a call from my stockbroker. ‘Have you got a television in front of you?’. There was one in the next room. He said ‘Turn on the television – now!’”

United’s supporters had already begun arriving in Athens. Many had flown in the morning and knew nothing about what had happened until they touched down and switched on their phones.

Others had flights out from the UK booked for the Tuesday evening and half-expected they would be stopped from taking off. Hibernian were also due to play AEK Athens in the first round of the UEFA Cup on the Thursday and the Scottish club’s followers were arriving in the Greek capital.

“We were on one of the last flights out of Gatwick airport” says Kerry Davies one of the United fans on the trip. “I’d been watching everything unfold on television during the day and when we got to the airport we weren’t even sure the flights were going to leave. It was just a really weird atmosphere from start to finish.”

Edwards had stepped down as United’s chief executive a year earlier and that meant it was his successor Peter Kenyon who liaised with UEFA and the travel authorities about what would happen next. Ferguson’s pre-match press conference was cancelled and the Tuesday night training session curtailed.

The decision to call off the match was officially relayed in a statement from UEFA headquarters the following morning and Kenyon made it clear United backed the decision. Football he said felt “irrelevant” in the context of what had happened in New York and Washington DC.

Olympiakos however were unhappy with UEFA’s stance. “We are very very upset” said a spokesman for the Greek champions. “This cancellation changes all our plans.”

If that sounds terribly callous it is worth remembering it was one of those occasions when the football authorities all seemed to have a different idea about the best course of action. The Football League went ahead with their midweek League Cup matches. FIFA also opted against postponing international matches in Asia the following weekend. But UEFA had been heavily criticised for going ahead with the Champions League matches the night before.

It was different for the Wednesday night games (the UEFA Cup fixtures scheduled for the Thursday were also called off) and as soon as the announcement was made United set about trying to find out when they would be allowed to fly back to the UK.

Every player got a knock at their hotel-room door to be informed that a team meeting had been arranged downstairs. They had already guessed what it would be: Ferguson was waiting for them. He told them their game was off and that they would be returning to Manchester as soon as it could be arranged.

The Olympiakos game was eventually played on October 10 and United decided at some point to make a financial gesture to all the supporters who had travelled for the original date. Every fan who had bought a ticket was given £150 in compensation to help cover their travel costs.

First though United had to arrange with the relevant authorities how to get Ferguson and his players safely back to England.

Many of the players on their flight out of Athens were keen to get home but at the same time anxious about being in the air in the circumstances. The players talked between themselves about whether they too might be a target for terrorists.

Ferguson was in his usual position — front row aisle seat — beside his coaches and the directors but for once he did not have a book with him to read. The players were a few rows back and the journalists were at the back of the plane. Security was at its highest level. And it was quiet.

Usually the mood on those trips would be quite upbeat as long as United had not lost. Not that day though. The plane took off and everyone sat there in near-silence.

According to a Slack message obtained by CNBC the company didn’t refer to any specific state but the message was sent to thousands of employees late Friday a day after the US Department of Justice sued Texas over its new abortion law.

“These are incredibly personal issues that directly impact many of us — especially women” the Slack message reads according to CNBC. “[I]f you have concerns about access to reproductive healthcare in your state Salesforce will help relocate you and members of your immediate family.”

The Slack message didn’t suggest the company was taking a position on abortion or the new Texas law noting that “we all have deeply held and different perspectives. As a company we stand with all of our women at Salesforce and everywhere.”

Later CEO Mark Benioff clarified that the company apparently did have Texas in mind when it sent the Slack message tweeting “Ohana if you want to move we’ll help you exit TX. Your choice” and linking to the CNBC report (the word “Ohana” is considered a neologism that is typically translated to mean “family” in Hawaiian).

The Texas law bans abortion after six weeks— before most people realize they are pregnant— has no exception for rape or incest and empowers anyone to sue someone else for “aiding and abetting” abortions after six weeks. That includes not only the person seeking the abortion and abortion clinics but anyone who helps pay for the procedure or drives a person to have the procedure.

In a rare moment of solidarity rival ride-hailing companies Lyft and Uber both said last week they would cover legal fees for any of its drivers sued under the Texas law. And Bumble and Tinder parent company Match Group announced the creation of a relief fund for women seeking abortions. Both companies have their headquarters in Texas.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXNwb3J0c3Rlci5jb20vdHlzb24ta2lkZC1jZXNhcm8tYmVzdC13d2UtdGFnLXRlYW0tcG90ZW50aWFsL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tyson Kidd & Cesaro: The Best WWE Tag Team That Never Got To Reach Their Potential,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXNwb3J0c3Rlci5jb20vdHlzb24ta2lkZC1jZXNhcm8tYmVzdC13d2UtdGFnLXRlYW0tcG90ZW50aWFsL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vdGVubmlzaGVhZC5uZXQvZW1tYS1yYWR1Y2FudS1qb2lucy1pbGx1c3RyaW91cy1ncm91cC13aXRoLWZsYXdsZXNzLXVzLW9wZW4tdGl0bGUtcnVuL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Emma Raducanu joins illustrious group with flawless US Open title run,"Emma Raducanu joins illustrious group with flawless US Open title run

Emma Raducanu did not drop a set in New York placing her in among a number of all-time legends of the women’s game with the achievement.

On top of the seemingly unending talking points about the brilliance of the Brit in her Major success Raducanu now sits among a handful of women to achieve maiden title mastery.

In the Open Era only seven women had previously won their first Slam title without dropping a set.

Among them are 18-time Slam champion Chris Evert who achieved the feat at the 1974 French Open and five-time Slam champion Martina Hingis who did so at the 1997 Australian Open.

As well as now being a part of such an exclusive club Raducanu can boast to be the only woman to accomplish the result across more than 14 sets of tennis.

Evert and Christine O’Neil won 12 sets (six matches) and 10 sets (five matches) respectively for their triumphs while the rest did so across a 128-woman seven match Slam draw.

However as a qualifier Raducanu played 10 matches on her way to winning the US Open title winning an incredible 20 sets consecutively to lift the trophy.

“Even though on paper I didn’t drop a set I think I faced a lot of adversity in every single on of my matches” the 18-year-old expressed during her post-final press conference.

“I was down or even if the scoreline was showing one thing the dynamic of the points and the games some long deuce games just to come through those are important.

“So I think what I did very well this tournament was press in the moments that I really needed to.”

Raducanu was dominant in every match she played never facing a set point or being pushed to a tiebreak.

Her closest set scoreline came in her second qualifying match against Mariam Bolkvadze 7-5 in the second.

Wearing No. 66 David DeCastro’s and Alan Faneca’s old numbers McCormick told reporters he’s fully aware of the legacy he’s replacing. At least in number.

“I have heard a little bit about it” he told reporters via Steelers.com when asked about his jersey digits. “I heard I got some big shoes to fill. And that’s super exciting.”

McCormick clearly isn’t backing away from the expectations. More similar to Troy Fautanu DeCastro was the team’s first-round pick in 2012 going lower in the draft than projections and the last West Coast college prospect the team had taken in the first round prior to Fautanu. After battling injury as a rookie DeCastro turned into one of the NFL’s best guards a six-time Pro Bowler and two-time All-Pro before ankle problems shortened his career. Faneca came before both of them a first round pick and Hall of Famer even if his call to Canton took longer than it should’ve.

A punishing run blocker with tons of experience McCormick didn’t get his phone call until early on Day 3 the team’s fourth round pick. While McCormick will keep his goals high expectations out of the gate are lower than they were for DeCastro. Pittsburgh’s starting guards of James Daniels and Isaac Seumalo are set in stone entering the spring meaning McCormick is set to begin the year as a backup.

But o-line depth is valuable and can be quickly tested. Pittsburgh has been incredibly fortunate to avoid serious or multiple offensive line injuries the past two seasons but sheer law of averages suggests that luck will run out. That could push McCormick into a role sooner than expected.

“I’m ready to do whatever it takes to get on the field” he said. “I’ll play either guard spot center whatever it takes. I just want to help this organization in any way I can.”

That could include reps at center. McCormick noted he was the backup center in college and had South Dakota State’s starter gotten hurt he would’ve shifted over. Pittsburgh worked him out as such shortly before the draft and though Zach Frazier’s selection makes him a clear favorite to start the Steelers like to make their backups as versatile as possible. Friday McCormick played right guard and the Steelers will likely have him work at guard this spring before considering center come training camp.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL3BpdHRzYnVyZ2gvbmV3cy9jYXNleS1nb2VzLWFmdGVyLW1jY29ybWljay1vbi1jb25uZWN0aWN1dC1yZXNpZGVuY3kv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2JzbmV3cy5jb20vYW1wL3BpdHRzYnVyZ2gvbmV3cy9jYXNleS1nb2VzLWFmdGVyLW1jY29ybWljay1vbi1jb25uZWN0aWN1dC1yZXNpZGVuY3kv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sen. Bob Casey goes after Dave McCormick on Connecticut residency,"PITTSBURGH (KDKA) — The race between Sen. Bob Casey and his Republican challenger former hedge fund CEO Dave McCormick is expected to be one of the most hotly contested elections in the nation.

Casey's name is synonymous with Pennsylvania especially Scranton. But it didn't take Casey long to label McCormick a Connecticut Yankee for living outside the state for many years.

""He hasn't told the truth about where he lives"" Casey said. ""He lives in Connecticut. He hasn't been truthful about that. So you have an out-of-state candidate who's being supported by out-of-state billionaires.""

KDKA-TV's Jon Delano: ""Where do you live?""

McCormick: ""I live in Pennsylvania. I live in Pittsburgh.""

Just before his run for U.S. Senate in 2022 McCormick who is divorced and remarried sold his home in Connecticut bought a home in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill and rented another home in Connecticut.

""My youngest daughter lives with her mother in Connecticut so I periodically go back to Connecticut to see my daughter. Being a good dad is even more important than being a good senator"" McCormick said.

McCormick grew up in Bloomsburg where his father was president of Bloomsburg University. But he also lived outside the state working first for the Bush administration and then as president and CEO of Bridgewater Associates a Connecticut-based multi-billion dollar hedge fund from 2009 to 2022.

McCormick sees the Connecticut residency issue as a distraction from Casey's record.

""When you have the results that Bob Casey has with inflation border crime the war on oil and gas the world falling apart what do you do? Well you try to make it about something that is unrelated in your opponent"" McCormick said.

But Casey says McCormick's long out-of-state residency coupled with his work for a hedge fund associated with multi-millionaires demonstrates who he will represent in the Senate.

""He hadn't voted in Pennsylvania in about 16 years. So I think that's going to be an issue. But I think ultimately it's going to be about whose side you are on"" Casey said.

Casey sees himself as representing hard-working middle-class Pennsylvanians while McCormick argues that Casey has failed to deliver any results.

McCormick criticizes Casey for supporting President Biden's infrastructure bill CHIPS and Science Act the Inflation Reduction Act and other bills.

""Bob Casey has been a 98% vote for Joe Biden"" McCormick said.

Casey sees himself as a soft-spoken doer who gets things done for this part of Pennsylvania.

""The bridge investment alone is about a quarter of a billion dollars just for bridges"" Casey said. ""But there's investments for K-12 education investments for communities all across the board whether it was in the infrastructure bill the American Rescue legislation or otherwise. So we've been able to get resources to communities to try to lift them up but we still have work to do so I want to keep delivering.""

The two candidates disagree on other issues as well like abortion. Casey who is personally pro-life supports the Women's Health Protection Act to codify abortion rights nationwide while McCormick opposes abortion with limited exceptions and opposes all federal legislation on the subject.

""Our states should decide"" McCormick said. ""Pennsylvania should decide as it has. My belief is that we shouldn't have bans. We shouldn't have national legislation.""

Casey says McCormick's work at the hedge fund to promote China will be another issue.

""When China cheats Pennsylvania loses jobs. So he's helped to fuel that rise of China and I think that's going to be a major issue in the campaign"" Casey said.

Delano: ""So you're suggesting he's soft on China?""

Casey: ""I don't think there's any question about it compared to what I've been doing.""

""I've been in business"" McCormick said. ""Yes my business did 2% of its business in China. I know what it's like to negotiate against the Chinese in the government and in business. There is no one better equipped to deal with the challenge of China than me.""

These are just a few of many issues on which Casey and McCormick disagree. Given the millions both campaigns will spend expect to hear a lot more in the months ahead.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA4L21jY29ybWljay1wYWMtYWQtcGVubnN5bHZhbmlhLXNlbmF0ZS1jYXNledIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Scoop: McCormick PAC launches big ad buy in Pennsylvania Senate race,"A super PAC supporting Republican David McCormick's Senate run in Pennsylvania is launching a $4 million TV ad buy today its first in one of the most-watched contests of the 2024 campaign. Why it matters: Pennsylvania's race between McCormick and Democratic incumbent Bob Casey Jr. could determine which party controls the Senate next year — and is a prime opportunity for Republicans to gain a seat.

Driving the news: Keystone Renewal PAC's first ad focuses on McCormick's time at West Point and his earning a Bronze Star while serving in the Gulf War.

The ad promoting the former hedge fund CEO will run for four weeks beginning on cable broadcast and digital platforms in the Pittsburgh Scranton Harrisburg and Johnstown markets.

McMormick's campaign aims to make his military service a constant theme in his campaign against Casey who's seeking his fourth six-year term in the Senate.

McCormick is making his second run for the Senate. In 2022 he lost in the GOP primary to Mehmet Oz who went on to lose to Democrat John Fetterman in the midterm election.

Between the lines: The McCormick ad's focus on ""duty honor and country"" echoes an ad his official campaign put out last week.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9uZXdzL2NhbmFkYS9sb25kb24vc29tZWJvZHktd2lsbC1kaWUtaWYtZm9ybWVyLW1jY29ybWljay1zLWZhY3RvcnktaXNuLXQtdG9ybi1kb3duLW5laWdoYm91cnMtc2F5LTEuNzE5OTI4OdIBIGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9hbXAvMS43MTk5Mjg5?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Somebody will die' if former McCormick's factory isn't torn down neighbours say,"The owners of the former McCormick's candy factory on Dundas Street have been ordered by city bylaw officials to restore security fencing around the crumbling building but business owners near the property say much more needs to be done to deal with what they call a dangerous eyesore.

""The fence usually lasts 48 hours"" said Gord Inglis who operates Inglis Cycle located on McCormick Boulevard behind the property. ""It's very run down neglected not looked after and ignored and it's turned into a playground for children and an area where homeless people [go] in and out.""

A work order was posted on three parts of the fence surrounding some of the property stating that a property inspection done May 8 found contraventions of a city bylaw that requires owners to ensure that vacant buildings are secured against unauthorized entry and to protect the building from the risk of ""fire accident or other danger.""

When a CBC News reporter visited the site on Thursday there were at least eight places where the fence had been torn down partially or completely allowing anyone to walk onto the property.

Windows doors and duct openings were recently covered with plywood Inglis said but that's also usually torn down within days.

Redevelopment of the factory has stalled while the owner of the property appeals limits set by city council. (Kate Dubinski/CBC)

Two young teens had to be rescued from the roof of the building on Sunday night London Fire said. There was a fire in the building and the teens who were exploring inside made their way to the roof while they waited for help said Platoon Chief Kirk Loveland. An aerial ladder was used to communicate with the youth and tell them to stay put until firefighters came to the roof to escort them out of the building he said. The teens weren't hurt and were taken away by police.

A similar incident happened on Thursday afternoon. A teen was stuck in the building and police requested the aerial truck again so they could communicate with the young person and escort them out of the building.

Seeing young people in the building is a frequent occurrence Inglis said. ""I feel the city is playing with the devil. Every time an emergency service is called to the building it seems to be more severe. If you don't do something with this building somebody is going to get hurt.""

There are concerns over this former east London factory as redevelopment plans have stalled Duration 0:56 Once a bustling confectionary factory the former McCormick building is now an eyesore that is dangerous for people going in to strip out any metal that can be sold for cash and youth looking for an urban exploring thrill.

'We're picking up garbage everyday'

The recent rescue was just one of the latest incidents where emergency crews were called to the building said Lou Fatibene who owns neighbouring Dundas Automotive.

""I'm surprised nobody's been killed over there yet"" Fatibene said. ""We've had cars broken into the whole area has been vandalized. We're picking up garbage every day.""

Somebody's going to die"" he said. ""How much did it cost us taxpayers to have that aerial truck out there to save the kids?""

Tena Smith who works at Tim's Tires across the street from the old factory says young people are using it as an urban exploration site. Some throw bricks and other items from the roof damaging property and cars below.

""Every Monday when we come in after the weekend it's like the teenagers have had a heyday in there and they've knocked out more windows"" she said. ""We used to park our cars over there to make room for our customers but they throw stuff off the roof. A brick landed on my car and dented my roof so we don't park over there anymore.""

The fence that's supposed to keep people out of the crumbling factory is not very effective. (Kate Dubinski/CBC)

The owners of the property Sierra Construction based in Woodstock did not reply to emails and phone calls asking for comment. They have until May 12 to comply with the city's work order.

The company bought the property for $1. In 2021 McCormick Villages Inc. owned and run by Sierra Construction submitted a plan for a subdivision for the factory site comprising of five hectares. In October 2022 city council approved the development which included repurposing the former factory into a mixed-use mid-rise building as well as townhouses a long-term care facility and a seniors apartment building on the property.

But Sierra Construction wasn't happy with council's decision to limit the apartment building height to five-storeys and to make a multi-use path on the property publicly-accessible among other issues. The Ontario Land Tribunal will consider that appeal in June.

It's been frustrating watching the building and property fall further and further into disrepair said Ward 4 Coun. Susan Stevenson. ""It's becoming a huge safety concern and a lot of people are worried that there will be a tragedy there let alone the disturbance to the neighbourhood that's happening as well"" she said. ""The neighbours just want it taken down."""
MCD,McDonald's,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlZXZlcnltb20uY29tL2ktZW5kZWQtZGF5LTEtb2YtbXktcGxhbm5lZC1kZXRveC1hdC1tY2RvbmFsZHMtdGhpcy1pcy13aGF0LWktbGVhcm5lZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What I Learned From Quitting a Detox With McDonald's,"I decided I’d do one of those 10-day detoxes recently.

I’d have to eat clean (so definitely no emotional eating of Oreos or pints of Ben & Jerry’s after a long and stressful day) only eat within certain timeframes (so definitely definitely no sneaking the Ben & Jerry’s post-bedtime when one would really need it) and no caffeine (it somehow didn’t dawn on me at the time that going from three to four cups of coffee a day to none at all would be tricky…) among a few other rules.

I was ready to finally lose the baby weight from baby No. 3. I was determined to find a way back to myself. I was ready to DO THIS.

Now did I mention I have a 5-year-old a 3.5-year-old and an almost 2-year-old? Oh and that I stay home with my children but write on the side and attempt to manage our home and drive the kids so many places and cook so many meals and take a class on Tuesday nights and never go to bed before 11 p.m. and have a husband I try to interact with at least a little bit during the day and haven’t gotten a solid night’s sleep in about six years?

So guess how I did with my detox plan?

Well I ended day 1 of my 10-day detox sitting in the McDonald’s drive-thru line at 10 p.m. at night soOoOo… it was pretty awesome.

I know guys.

McDonald’s is considered crappy food. But you see for some odd reason I decided to start the detox on my longest day of the week—a Tuesday. The day I needed to drive into the city for my class from 6-9 p.m. A day where I would typically lean toward the four cups of coffee fo’ sho. And also did I mention I had my period that day? So my hormones and lack of caffeine got together and created a horrendous migraine for me on top of it all.

Mercury had to be in retrograde or something. It was a wild day.

I couldn’t cope. I needed a fountain soda. (And fries. And a hamburger.) So basically what I’m saying is this—McDonald’s saved my life that day. A day where I was only supposed to eat leaves and snack bars that tasted like cardboard and spend two hours—at minimum—cooking a gourmet plant-based dinner for myself after already cooking at least two or three other meals for my children. (Listen I am not a chef. I should not be spending that much time in the kitchen.)

I was destined to fail this detox program the minute I started it.

My body couldn’t physically handle the caffeine withdrawals I couldn’t emotionally get past the overwhelm of the meal plan I was supposed to cook and I decided I was tired. Tired of feeling shame because of my soft belly. Tired of looking at myself in the mirror and thinking if only you were skinnier… Tired of wearing multiple pairs of Spanx under dresses to squeeze my flesh and hide my rolls. Tired of buying into these programs that promise a thinner happier me. Tired of feeling like I’m not enough because my body’s too much. Tired of comparing the size of my waistline to that IG influencer’s.

I couldn’t emotionally get past the overwhelm of the meal plan I was supposed to cook and I decided I was tired. Tired of feeling shame because of my soft belly. Tired of looking at myself in the mirror and thinking if only you were skinnier…

Tired of the bullshit standards set forth by the beauty fashion and diet industries that prey on us and our insecurities in order to make billions of dollars. You see a wrinkle? God forbid. Get this $200 cream on it immediately. Stretch mark? Shame on you. Laser those off. Eyelashes too short? Get extensions. Here’s a pill here’s a supplement here’s a cover here’s a mask…

…here’s a lie.

A lie that tells us we’re not good enough.

I know it’s a lie because I know we are good enough. We really are.

My soft belly grew three children and carried them each for 40+ weeks. My body is strong from lifting multiple children at one time. My heart is so much bigger than my rolls I squish with shapewear. My programming has shifted—from weight loss to longevity and health. My worth is not determined by the number on the scale. My waistline has changed and so have I. My standards have increased.

That day taught me a few things.

“Failing” before I even finished Day One would have crushed me a few years ago. I would have come down so hard on myself. It would have added to any anger anxiety or negative self-talk I already had going on.

But this time it didn’t crush me.

Instead I found myself wondering what the hell I was thinking in the first place. That plan was not meant for me.

I’m focusing now on building my strength back up and moving my body every day because it makes me feel great.

I’ve since decided I needed to get myself back on the health wagon after spiraling out of control with what and how much I was eating—but not in an extreme way. I’m focusing now on building my strength back up and moving my body every day because it makes me feel great.

I’m monitoring my emotional binge eating and seeing what triggers certain cravings. I’m not making gourmet plant-based meals but I am cooking with real foods and eating proper proportions. I’m watching what I’m putting in my body I’m listening to what my body is saying and I’m paying attention to what and how I’m feeling.

I’m setting healthier patterns for myself and showing myself some grace along the way.

I’m respecting my body and all it has given me.

And I’m trying not to end my days sitting in the drive-thru line at McDonald’s as much as possible.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vc29yYW5ld3MyNC5jb20vMjAyMS8wOS8xMS9tY2RvbmFsZHMtamFwYW5zLXRzdWtpbWktbW9vbi12aWV3aW5nLXBpZS1vb3plcy1qYXBhbmVzZS1mbGF2b3VyL9IBZ2h0dHBzOi8vc29yYW5ld3MyNC5jb20vMjAyMS8wOS8xMS9tY2RvbmFsZHMtamFwYW5zLXRzdWtpbWktbW9vbi12aWV3aW5nLXBpZS1vb3plcy1qYXBhbmVzZS1mbGF2b3VyL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,McDonald’s Japan’s Tsukimi “moon-viewing” pie oozes Japanese flavour,"The perfect flavour for a traditional Japanese festival.

It’s that time of year again when the autumnal harvest moon shines bright over Japan inspiring people to hold “tsukimi” (“moon-viewing“) events in its honour. One place where the moon shines particularly bright is over at McDonald’s where you’ll find the “Tsukimi Family” on the menu for a limited time.

▼ This year’s “Tsukimi Family”.

As soon as the range was released on 8 September we headed out to pick up one of the sweetest members of the family – the Tsukimi Pie. Although it first debuted as part of the Tsukimi range three years ago it’s proven to be so popular that it’s become a mainstay of the annual collection.

After trying it for the first time last year we’ve been hooked on this unusual pie and waiting with fingers crossed for it to return this year. What makes it so unusual is the fact that it contains adzuki red bean paste and mochi sticky rice which makes for a filling that’s rich delightfully chewy and singing out with the traditional sweet flavours of Japan that are perfect for a traditional celebration like moon-viewing.

The white mochi resembles the bright moon while the dark red bean paste can be seen as the night sky. Opening the pie reveals a generous portion of ingredients and interestingly it’s reminiscent of a taiyaki fish-shaped sweet only instead of the taiyaki’s chewy outer dough everything is encased in crunchy crispy McDonald’s pie pastry.

This dessert unique to McDonald’s Japan is like a fusion sweet that combines the traditional taste of Japan with the classic taste of American pie. Every bite of this is pure decadence and there’s an added aspect of fun in the fact that you can feel as if you’re consuming the moon and becoming one with it while at the same time gazing upon the real thing outdoors.

The Tsukimi Pie retails for 150 yen (US$1.36) and can be purchased all day as it’s part of the morning menu before 10:30 a.m. as well. It’s only available until mid-October though and in order to ensure it returns next year due to popular demand we’ll be consuming a bucketload of these while they’re on sale along with the new Rich Melty Burger which in our opinion is the richest tasting burger in the history of moon-viewing burgers!

During an Aug. 29 2021 interview with the Canadian news outlet CBC Brian Bates a long-time manager at a McDonald's franchise in Windsor a city in Ontario dropped what may have been a top secret nugget about the purple tear-drop-shaped character.

""He is an enormous taste bud but a taste bud nonetheless"" Bates said.

McDonald's obliquely and humorously addressed the matter in a Twitter post without actually answering the question at hand.

The company also addressed the question in 2014 also on Twitter but again left it a bit open:

Of course this begs the question what does a tastebud look like and does Grimace resemble one? Here's one take posted on social media:

When I heard the news McDonald's long-awaited plant burger was finally hitting UK menus this year after three years of development it occurred to me that I'd never actually tried their non-meat options before.

Turns out there is only one the Veggie Deluxe so I decided I might as well try one out to see why they'd put so much time and effort into developing a brand new vegan burger to replace it.

To best way do this I figured was to pit the Veggie Deluxe against the classic Big Mac and see which comes out on top.

I don't go to McDonald's all that often to be completely honest I feel like they're a jack of all trades and master of none I go elsewhere for chicken and I go elsewhere for burgers.

But overall they're always good and the Big Mac is a pretty solid burger so it was going to take something above average to top it.

But I've tried out a few different meat-free burgers at home over the last year or so and you can get some great ones.

You can get some absolutely woeful ones too though.

As this is McDonalds and surely they have certain standards to upkeep I was fully expecting to be pleasantly surprised so let's get into what I found.

My first impression of the Big Mac having had a handful previously in my life was the way it was absolutely overflowing with salad.

The Big Mac

I'm not sure whether this was due to a rushed assembly or just part of the Big Mac experience TM but it was quite annoying.

The burger itself looked pretty good as far as fast food goes and tasted even better.

The various different garnishes and sauces perfectly complimenting the meat and cheese coming together to form a strong flavour as it should be.

I was intrigued with how my Veggie Deluxe would compare.

The Veggie Deluxe

Much like the Big Mac this was difficult to get a good grip of not because it was so packed full of food though.

The Veggie Deluxe felt a lot more like the veggie-lite with two battered fish-finger looking pieces of veggie goodness replacing the meat.

The only issue was the bun dwarfed them meaning they rattled around between the two halves making the whole thing deceptively hard to handle.

When I did manage to tame it for a bite I was left disappointed.

The veggie-fingers may as well have been hollow batter collapsing under bite to reveal a mostly empty shell with a small amount of veggie paste.

Even worse this veggie paste tasted somewhere between cardboard and gone off tomato.

The taste did improve when I hit a vein of mayo which helped to lubricate the crusty dry sticks but quite frankly the flavour was too far for it to do anything other than mitigate the nastiness.

I had to give up just halfway through.

Verdict

Suddenly the reason McDonald's put three years of time money and effort into producing a plant based vegan burger that actually tastes good made a whole lot more sense.

But the fact they've left this 'deluxe' abomination on their menus for that entire time without improvement or some kind of temporary replacement is quite shocking.

The wide range of veggie burgers out there that are very pleasant suggests it really shouldn't be that hard or take that long especially for a billion dollar company.

Adjuvant treatment with Keytruda and chemotherapy—with or without radiotherapy—failed to hit the mark for disease-free survival (DFS) in newly diagnosed high-risk endometrial cancer patients who received surgery with curative intent according to an interim analysis of Merck’s late-stage KEYNOTE-B21 study. DFS refers to the length of time after a primary treatment ends that a patient survives without any signs or symptoms of their cancer.

The trial’s other primary endpoint overall survival was not formally tested because the Keytruda-chemo combo failed to reach statistical significance on the DFS metric Merck said in a Thursday release.

Merck says it’s continuing a full evaluation of the data and is working with investigators to share the results at a later date.

Endometrial cancer is the sixth most common cancer in women and the most common type of cancer in the uterus according to Merck. In the U.S. alone the company estimates roughly 67880 patients will be diagnosed with uterine body cancer this year. Merck also estimates there will be 13250 patient deaths from the disease in 2024.

“While these results were not what we had hoped we are focused on continuing to build on the established role of Keytruda in advanced endometrial carcinoma through our approved indications” Gursel Aktan M.D. Ph.D. vice president of global clinical development at Merck Research Laboratories said in a statement.

Merck will continue to test Keytruda-based combinations—plus other treatment approaches like antibody-drug conjugates (ADC)—in endometrial and other types of gynecologic cancers Aktan said.

Keytruda is already approved in patients with endometrial carcinoma that is microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR). The PD-1 inhibitor picked up that nod in 2022 following a 2017 approval that allowed the drug to cover previously treated MSI-H/dMMR tumors in patients without alternative treatment options.

Keytruda also boasts a second indication alongside Eisai-partnered Lenvima in previously treated endometrial cancer that’s not dMMR.

Over the past year Merck’s Keytruda has been sparring with GSK’s PD-1 rival Jemperli over endometrial cancer dominance in the clinic.

Last February just two months after Jemperli snagged a historic win for immunotherapy in first-line endometrial cancer Keytruda plus standard chemotherapy beat chemotherapy alone at staving off tumor progression or death in advanced or recurrent disease.

The following month at the Society of Gynecologic Oncology 2023 annual meeting both GSK and Merck provided a closer look at their meds’ late-stage performance in first-line endometrial cancer with Keytruda appearing to edge out Jemperli in MMR proficient (pMMR) patients—a key subgroup that Merck says comprises roughly two-thirds of all endometrial cancer cases.

GSK ultimately beat Merck to the finish line for a PD-1 nod in newly diagnosed disease with the company’s Jemperli in July snagging FDA clearance as an add-on to chemotherapy for patients with primary advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer but only for tumors that are mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H).

Meanwhile Merck and Eisai’s Keytruda-Lenvima combo in December missed the mark in a phase 3 study as a potential first-line treatment in certain patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma. The oncology cocktail failed to demonstrate an improvement in overall survival and progression-free survival over a regimen of platinum-based chemotherapy missing both of its primary endpoints.

While Keytruda climbed to the top of pharma's sales charts in 2023 the drug has experienced a series of clinical ups and downs in 2024.

The PD-1 inhibitor started out the year by delivering a partial win in a phase 3 study pitting the drug against high-risk localized muscle-invasive bladder cancer and locally advanced bladder cancer. Around the same time Keytruda bolstered its case as a postsurgical treatment for resectable kidney cancer with data showing it helped slash the risk of death by 38% versus placebo post-kidney removal in patients with clear cell renal carcinoma—the most common form of kidney cancer.

The drug also posted a win in cervical cancer in March. But that same month Keytruda in combination with Lynparza failed to improve patients’ life expectancy or delay progression or death when subbed in for the chemotherapy pemetrexed during maintenance treatment of newly diagnosed metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lunger cancer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vaGVhbHRoLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuaW5kaWF0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9waGFybWEvcGhhcm1hLWluZHVzdHJ5L21lcmNrcy1lbmRvbWV0cmlhbC1jYW5jZXItdGhlcmFweS1mYWlscy10cmlhbC8xMDk5ODI0OTbSAYMBaHR0cHM6Ly9oZWFsdGguZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy9waGFybWEvcGhhcm1hLWluZHVzdHJ5L21lcmNrcy1lbmRvbWV0cmlhbC1jYW5jZXItdGhlcmFweS1mYWlscy10cmlhbC8xMDk5ODI0OTY?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Merck's endometrial cancer therapy fails trial,"Join the community of 2M+ industry professionals Subscribe to our newsletter to get latest insights & analysis.

“An epidemic of diphtheria is almost inevitable here. Stop. I am in urgent need of one million units of diphtheria antitoxin. Stop. Mail is only form of transportation. Stop.”

Dr. Curtis Welch

This was the desperate radio telegram in January 1925 from Dr. Curtis Welch in Nome Alaska to all the major Alaska towns to territorial governor Scott Bone in Juneau and to the U.S. Public Health Service in Washington D.C. Diphtheria was spreading through the icebound community. Children had already died and the local supply of diphtheria antitoxin had expired the previous summer.

Known as the “Great Race of Mercy” it’s an iconic story of human compassion.

Weather prevented delivery by air so relay teams of sled dogs and their mushers raced against the clock to deliver 300000 units of antitoxin which was produced by Merck legacy company H.K. Mulford. They completed the 674-mile journey over what later became known as the Iditarod Trail in a record-breaking five days and seven hours despite whiteout conditions and temperatures of 50 degrees below zero.

Apple Fortnite trial ruling,"On Friday a California judge ruled on the influential Epic v. Apple lawsuit and both sides lost. Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers concluded that Apple wasn’t unfairly monopolizing the mobile app space with iOS or its in-app purchasing system and she ordered Epic to pay damages for violating its developer agreement with Fortnite. At the same time she ordered Apple to remove its anti-steering rules — policies banning developers from telling users about alternatives to Apple’s in-app purchase system.

For readers outside those two companies though Judge Gonzalez Rogers’ opinion has a lot to offer. Rogers clearly considers much of Epic and Apple’s behavior silly and many of both companies’ arguments bad. But she seriously examines all these arguments and lays out a blueprint for further legal arguments about mobile platforms app monopolies and modern antitrust law.

So we’re going to take a close look into the ruling’s biggest conclusions — and what they mean for both companies.

The Fortnite suit is about mobile game payments not iOS apps or the bigger game market

During the trial both sides argued over which market Fortnite’s iOS app belonged to. Epic claimed Apple had abused a monopoly on the iOS app ecosystem; Apple claimed Fortnite was playing in the more competitive overall digital game market. (This is why the trial’s lawyers kept asking whether Fortnite is a game.)

Judge Gonzalez Rogers says both these definitions are wrong although Apple’s is somewhat less wrong. Instead the question is whether Apple has an unlawful monopoly in “digital mobile gaming transactions.” Gonzalez Rogers notes that mobile games often have a different user base than PC or console games and they rely hugely on the “freemium” model of in-game item sales which are less important to both mobile apps and console or PC games.

Epic made 10 claims against Apple. Most of them depended significantly on Apple having an unfair monopoly under either the federal Sherman Antitrust Act or California’s antitrust-focused Cartwright Act. And although the ruling is sympathetic toward several of Epic’s underlying arguments nearly all its claims were dismissed.

Apple doesn’t have a monopoly in mobile gaming — yet

Mobile games are a huge part of Apple’s App Store revenue — approximately 70 percent according to the ruling — and Apple has outsized power in mobile gaming. Gonzalez Rogers concludes iOS and Android hold a near-duopoly although she considers the Nintendo Switch and cloud gaming services potential near-future competitors. The ruling estimates that Apple has a share of around 55 percent in the mobile game transactions market alongside “extraordinarily high profit margins” which can be a sign of monopoly power.

“Success is not illegal”

But despite Apple’s “considerable” power and profit margins “these factors alone do not show antitrust conduct. Success is not illegal” Gonzalez Rogers concludes. While Epic argued that iMessage and other factors deliberately lock users into iOS Gonzalez Rogers wasn’t convinced by this line of reasoning.

The ruling leaves the door open for future antitrust complaints. “The evidence does suggest that Apple is near the precipice of substantial market power or monopoly power with its considerable market share” Gonzalez Rogers writes. “Apple is only saved by the fact that its share is not higher that competitors from related submarkets are making inroads into the mobile gaming submarket and perhaps because [Epic] did not focus on this topic.”

For now though this judgment undercut Epic’s allegation that Apple maintained a monopoly or unlawfully restrained trade under the Sherman Act helping taking down four of its claims against Apple. The ruling says that by extension it means Apple didn’t violate California’s Cartwright Act taking down two more of the claims.

A seventh claim said iOS was an “essential facility” that Apple had unfairly denied access to. But Epic didn’t seriously argue this claim and for mobile app developers Gonzalez Rogers says web apps and other digital platforms provide a reasonable (if not ideal) distribution alternative.

The App Store has a troubling lack of competition

The Epic v. Apple ruling has some harsh words for the App Store. At one point Gonzalez Rogers notes that “nothing other than legal action seems to motivate Apple to reconsider pricing and reduce rates.” At other points she says Apple “does a poor job of mediating disputes between a developer and its customer” and it’s been “slow either to adopt automated tools that could improve speed and accuracy or to hire more reviewers” for its app review process. “Apple’s slow innovation stems in part from its low investment in the App Store” the ruling elaborates.

Meanwhile although Gonzalez Rogers takes a dim view of Epic’s economic analysis she accepts that “Apple’s operating margins tied to the App Store are extraordinarily high.” And she specifically calls out a lack of competition as an issue. “The point is not that ... Apple provides bad services. It does not” she writes. “The point is that a third-party app store could put pressure on Apple to innovate by providing features that Apple has neglected.”

Apple has valid security fears about opening up iOS

Apple’s trial witnesses promoted iOS as an unusually safe and secure ecosystem because of its walled-garden model saying no other option would be appropriate for the sensitive data on people’s phones. Epic called that claim a pretext for shutting down competition.

The ruling deflates some of Apple’s protestations. Judge Gonzalez Rogers is particularly dubious of Apple software engineering VP Craig Federighi who delivered a dramatic but suspiciously new denunciation of macOS malware. She’s generally receptive to Epic’s suggestion that Apple could review and notarize iOS apps for security but allow distribution through other sources similar to macOS. “Even though unrestricted app distribution likely decreases security alternative models are readily achievable to attain the same ends even if not currently employed” she concludes.

Gonzalez Rogers doesn’t think that makes Apple’s claims pretextual though. She agrees with Apple that comprehensive human review — which isn’t part of macOS notarization — can offer a “safe and trusted user experience” that’s actually pro-consumer. By contrast she says Epic’s proposed solutions “principally appear to eliminate app review.”

The ruling dashes Epic’s hope that Apple would legally have to allow sideloaded apps and third-party app stores on iOS — which was Apple’s worst-case scenario going into the trial.

Apple has a right to require its in-app payment options

As you might remember if you’ve been following Epic v. Apple this whole dispute started with in-app purchase (or IAP) payment processing. Epic tweaked Fortnite on iOS so that players could buy in-game V-Bucks via two methods: the Apple App Store or an “Epic direct payment” with a 20 percent discount.

Epic’s “Direct Pay” option on Fortnite for iOS August 2020

Epic described Apple’s IAP system as a glorified payment processor with outsized fees and it argued that Apple was illegally tying IAP to the overall App Store. In Epic’s view developers should be able to offer multiple payment processing options or reject Apple’s payment system altogether.

This is a big point of dissatisfaction among major app developers and Friday’s ruling isn’t terribly promising for them.

Gonzalez Rogers is skeptical of some Apple arguments for its current locked-down system and the attendant 30 percent — for big companies like Epic — commission. (Dunking on both sides’ expert witness analysis is a running theme in her ruling.) She also notes there’s “no evidence that IAP provides developers with any unique features” compared to standard payment processing. But she’s fairly straightforwardly opposed to making Apple unbundle the system calling Epic’s request for it “deficient.”

Throughout the trial Apple has said that it’s not simply charging for payment processing on IAP. It’s using it to collect a commission — the 15 or 30 percent so-called “Apple Tax” — on the larger value of the App Store. Epic disputed that Apple meaningfully earned that commission saying that although the App Store connects (in its words “matches”) users with developers Apple doesn’t deserve a cut of every transaction that happens after that.

Apple and Epic argued over how much the in-app purchase system actually benefits developers

The ruling says the matching description is “partially true” but that Apple has “never argued that it levies a commission merely because it matches the developers with the customers.” Instead “IAP is the method by which Apple collects its licensing fee from developers for the use of Apple’s intellectual property.”

Gonzalez Rogers admittedly finds “no basis” for the specific 30 percent rate despite Apple hiring a consultant to testify about the value of its patents. (As mentioned previously the ruling is full of dunks on the expert witnesses.) But she says Apple is still entitled to license that intellectual property for a fee of some sort and requiring developers to use Apple’s payment system “accomplishes this goal in the easiest and most direct manner.”

Epic’s unbundling alternative meanwhile would “severely undermine” the system says the ruling. “Indeed to the extent Epic Games suggests that Apple receive nothing from in-app purchases made on its platform such a remedy is inconsistent with prevailing intellectual property law.”

Gonzalez Rogers’ conclusion is another reason Epic didn’t prevail on the monopoly maintenance or restraint of trade claims discussed above since two of them specifically dealt with IAP. She also says IAP isn’t a standalone product so Apple isn’t illegally tying it to the App Store which nixes two more Sherman and Cartwright Act claims.

For those keeping score that’s nine claims down for Epic. But there’s one final claim that makes this ruling a significant thorn in Apple’s side. Let’s talk about it.

iOS developers have a right to talk about alternatives

Gonzalez Rogers concludes that Apple doesn’t monopolize mobile gaming. But the company does violate California’s Unfair Competition Law (UCL) through its anti-steering rules: policies that restrict developers from telling users they can buy digital goods outside Apple’s ecosystem. The ruling focuses on this portion of Apple’s developer agreement:

“Apps and their metadata may not include buttons external links or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than in-app purchase.”

Gonzalez Rogers has almost unreserved scorn for this policy. “By employing anti-steering provisions consumers do not know what developers may be offering on their websites including lower prices” she writes. Developers are allowed to email customers to advertise but only through addresses they’ve collected outside the iOS signup process which consumers also don’t necessarily know.

Users don’t necessarily even know about the cut Apple is taking — that “if they subscribe to their favorite newspaper on the web” for instance “all the proceeds go to the newspaper rather than the reduced amount by subscribing on the iOS device.” Some people appreciate that Apple offers a unified place to manage subscriptions. But others might not and “Apple actively denies them the choice” to find alternatives.

“Apple created a new and innovative platform which was also a black box”

“Apple created a new and innovative platform which was also a black box. It enforced silence to control information and actively impede users from obtaining the knowledge to obtain digital goods on other platforms” Gonzalez Rogers concludes. “Apple has used this lack of knowledge to exploit its position.”

The ruling says Apple’s situation is “distinctly different” from another case that let American Express use anti-steering rules for brick-and-mortar merchants because even in that scenario merchants can still say they also accept Visa and MasterCard.

Accordingly a new injunction will soon prevent Apple from banning “buttons external links or other calls to action” that direct users to other payment mechanisms. That’s potentially a big deal for Apple... although it’s not yet clear just how big a deal.

Apple could collect an ‘Apple Tax’ even without in-app payment charges

As my colleague Nilay Patel discusses Judge Gonzalez Rogers’ injunction leaves some weird ambiguity about what developers can do. In theory a developer could add a button that directs users to Safari or another app for payment but looks indistinguishable from the option to pay with Apple’s system. (It’s worth noting the injunction doesn’t say Apple has to let developers build complete alternate payment methods into their apps and based on the statements quoted earlier Gonzalez Rogers seems fairly down on that prospect.)

But developers like Epic don’t just care about controlling payment methods out of principle — although it offers some unique benefits like getting to handle refunds. They care about ditching Apple’s 30 percent commission. And Gonzalez Rogers says bluntly that it’s not that simple.

Even if developers could entirely stop using the IAP system “Apple could still charge a commission on developers. It would simply be more difficult for Apple to collect that commission” Gonzalez Rogers writes. The ruling elaborates on this scenario — in which Apple is outright banned from making developers use its payment option — in a footnote:

“In such a hypothetical world developers could potentially avoid the commission while benefitting from Apple’s innovation and intellectual property free of charge. The Court presumes that in such circumstances that Apple may rely on imposing and utilizing a contractual right to audit developers annual accounting to ensure compliance with its commissions among other methods. Of course any alternatives to IAP (including the foregoing) would seemingly impose both increased monetary and time costs to both Apple and the developers.”

The law now says that Apple can’t stop developers from offering cheaper prices outside their iOS apps and telling users about it. But if big developers successfully route a lot of money away from the App Store this way Gonzalez Rogers seemingly leaves the door open to collecting the “Apple Tax” some other way.

Epic and Apple’s contract was valid and Epic knowingly broke it

The Epic v. Apple ruling declares that part of Apple’s developer agreement (called the DPLA) is unlawful... but Epic still has to pay for breaking it with the Fortnite payment system change. By the same token Apple doesn’t have to restore Fortnite or keep Epic’s other apps on iOS if it doesn’t agree to follow Apple’s rules. Why?

The first reason is basically that Apple’s agreement didn’t break the law enough. Epic claimed the contract was “illegal and unenforceable” because it violated the Sherman Act the Cartwright Act and the UCL. Gonzalez Rogers concludes that the single UCL offense wasn’t sufficiently related or severe to justify Epic’s rulebreaking. She also dismisses the claim that Apple’s contract was “unconscionable” — in other words one-sided enough to “shock the conscience.” (“These are billion and trillion dollar companies with a business dispute” the ruling notes dryly.)

The second reason is that Epic broke another rule in the process. It hid the alternate payment system inside a remote “hotfix” when Apple’s policies said it couldn’t “provide unlock or enable additional features or functionality through distribution mechanisms other than the App Store.” That specific provision wasn’t related to antitrust claims and the ruling concludes Epic “never showed why it had to breach its agreements” to challenge Apple’s alleged anti-competitive actions.

We still don’t know what a game is

Sure all the questions above are legally relevant and important for consumers and set a detailed precedent for future antitrust legislation and lawsuits. But let’s end with the fun part: after all the time witnesses spent arguing about what a video game is does the ruling give us a definition?

The short answer is no because it doesn’t have to. “The court need not reach a conclusive definition of a video game or game because by all accounts Fortnite itself is both externally and internally considered a video game.” Fortnite markets itself as a game and even if CEO Tim Sweeney considers it the basis for a larger metaverse (in case you were wondering “the court generally finds Mr. Sweeney’s personal beliefs about the future of the metaverse are sincerely held”) the metaverse as a product “remains in its infancy.”

As for the definitions introduced by witnesses “unfortunately no one agrees and neither side introduced evidence of any commonly accepted industry definition.” That includes Sweeney’s claim that a game “involves some sort of win or loss or a score progression” as well as Apple app review head Trystan Kosmynka’s claim that “games have a beginning [and] an end” and “there’s challenges in place.”

Gonzalez Rogers does however spend a surprising amount of time breaking down the core elements of a video game. Here’s a brief definition:

“The court concludes that video games include a diverse and eclectic genre of games that are tied together at minimum through varying degrees of interactivity and involvement from a game player.”

There’s also a more elaborate one:

“At a bare minimum video games appear to require some level of interactivity or involvement between the player and the medium. In other words a game requires that a player be able to input some level of a command or choice which is then reflected in the game itself. This gaming definition contrasts to other forms of entertainment which are often passive forms enjoyed by consumers (e.g. films television music). Video games are also generally graphically rendered or animated as opposed to being recorded live or via motion capture as in films and television.”

You could certainly quibble with elements of this and Gonzalez Rogers admits she’s not clarifying the “outer boundaries of the definition of video games.” She declines to say whether specific non-Epic titles like Roblox and Netflix’s Black Mirror: Bandersnatch are games. She also says she can’t conclude whether certain games on the Itch.io storefront were sexually explicit or problematic given that “the corresponding materials ... were not submitted to the court” — although she does offer a ruling on naked banana man decorum.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFscGhyLmNvbS9mYWNlYm9vay8xMDAzNTIxL3NlZS1ldmVyeXRoaW5nLWZhY2Vib29rLWtub3dzLWFib3V0LXlvdS1oZXJlLXMtaG93L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to See Everything Facebook Knows About You,"To say Facebook is a popular social media service is certainly downplaying all that it truly is. Facebook is a global corporation offering advertising and business products. The everyday user logs in to see their friends family and funny memes while rarely considering what information this company is collecting about them.

Facebook is no stranger to questionable privacy practices. In 2018 the company was subject to a scandal known as the Cambridge Analytica dealings; the company was also a part of a massive data breach and even had to pay the FTC 5 billion dollars for consumer privacy violations.

Once the news broke there was a spike in searches for how to delete a Facebook account and people looking for ways to have greater control of their Facebook data and what the site knows about them. Fortunately the company made it possible for users to learn more about their information and we have explained how to do that below. You can also discover if you or your friends were victims of the Cambridge Analytica scandal using this online tool.

Be warned though there really is a worrying amount of information. Some people have even noticed Facebook has been tracking all the calls and texts made using their mobile many without realizing it. If you want to take control of your privacy while continuing to use the platform we’ll teach you everything you need to know in this article.

How Intrusive is Facebook?

There’s a running joke that Facebook is listening to your conversations outside of the application. Many users have stated they’ve had a conversation and Facebook later presents an ad related to that conversation. The founder staunchly disputes this rumor but Facebook’s tracking algorithms are so good they almost seem true.

So what information is Facebook collecting and how are they using it?

Off-Facebook Activity

Off-Facebook activity is how Facebook is tracking your shopping and travel habits. According to Facebook when you search for something online or even go into a brick-and-mortar store to make a purchase that company shares your information with Facebook. Once Facebook receives this information the company uses it to send more personalized advertisements to your News Feed.

Apps and Web Activity

According to the company’s privacy policy Facebook will collect information about your online activity and your friend’s online activity too. This means that even if you deactivate or delete your account the information that Facebook collected from your friends will remain.

This permission is especially useful for you as a user because you can quickly log into most websites apps and even store your game progress in some cases.

Other information included in this category are as follows:

Your contacts – To help find “People You May Know”

Networks and Connections – Who and how you’re interacting with others

Transactions and Usage – How you use Facebook and its affiliated companies (WhatsApp Instagram etc.)

Device Information

This includes everything from your location to your IP Address and even your battery life. Once you’ve downloaded Facebook or signed in on a web browser Facebook has access to where you are and what type of device you’re using.

To better help detect bots Facebook can even track your mouse movements while using the platform.

Any Information That You Provide

From posts to interests events and profile information is stored by Facebook. If you’ve listed your political or religious views on Facebook the company is tracking and storing that information.

How to See What Data Facebook is Tracking

There are a lot of ways to see what information Facebook is tracking and storing about you. Fortunately the mobile application makes it really easy to see what is being stored and in some cases how Facebook obtained the data. So let’s get started with the easiest method first.

Keep in mind that all of these instructions will appear by following the Three-line menu icon>Settings path on the mobile app.

How to See Your Off-Facebook Activity

We’ll start with showing you which apps Facebook is gathering information about you from. Open the Settings on the Facebook app and follow these steps:

Scroll down in Settings to the Off-Facebook Activity option under the Your Facebook Information heading.

Tap on Manage Your Off-Facebook Activity.

A new page will appear where you can see each source of information. Tap on one to learn more.

After tapping on one of the sources in the list you will see which tools Facebook used to collect the data the number of interactions received and how the company is using this information.



If you feel this is a little too invasive you can delete all of the Off-Facebook history on your account by clicking the Clear History option shown in step 2 above. But do keep in mind this may effect some of your login information and game progress depending on the application.

You can also prohibit the individual app from communicating your personal information following these steps as well. Tap on the Turn off future activity from… option to stop an individual source from communicating with Facebook about your Off-Facebook activity.

Access Your Facebook Information

Your ‘Facebook Information’ is a broad term for various pieces of data the company has about you. Some of it is pretty standard stuff like your Facebook posts and friends. Other elements of this section are a little more intriguing. Let’s take a look:

Go to the Settings on your Facebook account. Then tap on Access Your Information under the Your Facebook Information heading.

Next you’ll see a page with quite a few categories. You can click on any of these to access links to the information is storing about you. For our example we’ll tap on Logged Information.

Scroll through the list of options to find out more.



Although it make take some time to go through each category and through each sub-category Facebook really does make it easy to see what the company is collecting and how. But there are other methods too.

Download your Facebook information:

Another option a more long-term option is to download all of your Facebook information onto a device of your chocie. So if you still want to see everything Facebook knows about you with just a couple of clicks and a bit of patience here is how:

Click the down arrow on your Facebook account and head to Settings and Privacy then Settings.





On the left side click Your Facebook Information.





Click View next to Download Your Information.





On the next page click Create File.





Click Available Copies the click Download Again.





You will be prompted to enter your password.





The file comes down as a .zip so make sure you have something capable of unpacking them; both OS X and Windows 10 handle this without needing extra software.





Now you can browse your way through a set of web page-like stores of information. For instance index.htm is an archived version of your Facebook profile including past relationships jobs and education institutions. You can view every photo you have uploaded along with all the EXIF data Facebook has on it – i.e. where and when it was taken and even where it was uploaded. You can even see everyone you have ever unfriended—sorry guys.

In fact Facebook has kept track of every event you have ever attended videos uploaded locations and devices you have logged in from the messages you have sent the images it compiles for facial recognition and even what advertising topics it thinks you prefer being served.

Download Facebook Data from a Mobile Device

It may be simpler to download your data from Facebook on a mobile device. To do this follow these steps:

Open the Facebook app and tap on the three horizontal lines to access Settings. (The three lines may be in the top left or right corner depending on your OS).

Tap on ‘Download Your Facebook Information‘ located under the Your Facebook Information section.

Uncheck any information you don’t care to download and make your date and file type selections. Tap ‘Create File‘ when you’re ready to download.

How to Control What Facebook Knows About You

If you’re concerned about the information Facebook has about you you can completely close your account (but beware your photos friends and even logins will be lost). Facebook states that if a user closes their account all information gathered from that account is removed.

The exception to this is that Facebook will still have some of your information thanks to your friends and connections.

Another way of controlling what Facebook collects your information is by minding your activity on the site. As stated above Facebook will keep track of anything you post or put on your profile any groups that join or even events you attend.

You can control how advertisers use your data by visiting your account settings and selecting ‘Ad Settings.’ You can toggle the available options from ‘Allow‘ to ‘Not Allowed.’

This will likely mean that you will receive random advertisements that don’t apply to you but if you’re privacy-minded doing these things is a good start to taking back control of your personal information.

Frequently Asked Questions

Protecting your privacy is of utmost importance. In case we didn’t cover everything you wanted to know about Facebook’s activities we have the answers to more of your questions.

What does Facebook do with the data they track?

As you can see Facebook keeps track of a lot of data and personal information. The majority of this information is used for marketing purposes. Facebook collects information on what you buy what your friends buy the groups your join (to see your interests) then shows you ads that the company thinks you may like.

Facebook also uses the information they collect to add features and functions to the platform that could make the user’s experience even better. Whenever Facebook does a new update and the interface changes this is a result of data collected about how users interact with the app or website.

Facebook also collects data on things that you or your friends post. For example the company uses facial recognition to better track your photos and videos. This is one of the reasons you may see tagging suggestions when you upload a photo. Like many other features on Facebook you can turn this off by going to the Settings>Face Recognition selections and tapping the option to turn this off.

Is there a list of everything that Facebook collects about its users?

Yes. Facebook is transparent about the information that the company gathers and keeps on its users. You can visit the Facebook privacy policy by clicking on this link or you can access it by tapping on Data Policy at the bottom of the Settings page on the mobile app.",,,

After their 4:30 a.m. wakeup call they loaded up The Tailgate Machine. By 6 a.m. 53-year-old Mike Marino his 17-year-old son Luke and his 45-year-old brother Matt were out of their home in Ocean Township and headed up the Garden State Parkway.

Destination: MetLife Stadium.

They arrived at the gate around 6:45 a.m. — about 9 hours before the Giants would kick off their 2021 season against the Denver Broncos and four hours before fans are allowed into the parking lots — to officially mark the 60th season of tailgating in the Marino family.

And with that they became the first Giants fans at MetLife Stadium during an NFL Sunday in 624 days marking the end to a long year of empty stands caused by the coronavirus pandemic.

“Being that we haven’t been here in two years we figured ‘Eh what the hell let’s just go early’” Mike Marino said. “Well we were here before everybody. That’s usually the case.”

John Esposito can vouch as their witness: The longtime MetLife security staffer arrived around 7:30 to find the Marino’s “Tailgate Machine” van already reserving its spot at the gate.

Esposito then witnessed another Giants family whose hardcore fandom is in its fourth generation arrive at the entrance to MetLife Stadium about two hours later.

Mark and Cheryl Liebes along with their son Michael also brought their tailgating van. Like the Marinos the Liebes family has owned Giants season tickets for six decades and they always bring the memory of that first generation with them to the Stadium.

The van known as the “King Harold” is named after the late patriarch of the family — a gesture from his grandson Michael who used the inheritance from his grandfather to purchase the vehicle.

“He said ‘Grandpa would love that I did this’ so we named it the King Harold” Cheryl Liebes said. “Usually we put out a bunch of candy for him because he loved chocolate so he’s always at the game with us.”

The Liebes family -- from left to right: Cheryl Michael Mark -- poses in front of the ""King Harold"" the tailgating van they drive to Giants games named after the late patriarch of the family that began the decades-long tradition of coming to MetLife Stadium.

The King Harold was stuck in the Liebes’ driveway in Manalapan throughout the 2020 season because of COVID-19 but the family tailgated in their driveway. Cars would honk and passengers would cheer when passing by.

“We were still celebrating the Giants” Cheryl said.

The Marinos did too in their own way.

Last season they met in Mike’s basement which can seat about 30 people. Usually reserved for Giants road games it was open every NFL Sunday serving as a place for neighbors and family to join him in suffering throughout a 6-10 season that somehow nearly ended in an NFC East title.

It’s because of what they saw in that basement throughout last winter that the Marinos are confident the Giants will get over the hump in head coach Joe Judge’s second season in charge. Asked for their predictions all three expected the Giants to beat the Broncos on Sunday and make the playoffs this winter.

“We’re always optimistic” Mike said. “This year we’re hoping for playoffs — 10 11 wins would be good and I think they can do it.”

“Sign me up for that!” said his brother Matt who drives up from White Marsh Maryland for every Giants home game. “You have to be optimistic. If you’re not why even bother?”

Buy Giants tickets: StubHub TicketSmarter

That is a good question for the Liebes family who said they were excited for the year but admitted they were bearish on how it will go.

While they might disagree on how they think the Giants will do this fall and who will be the key — the Marinos were split between Daniel Jones Saquon Barkley and Kenny Golladay — there is one thing the Liebes Marinos and everyone else who walks into MetLife Stadium on Sunday will agree on whether they were the first to arrive or the last.

“It’s good to be back” Matt Marino said. “We get to see everybody again after a year of COVID. These are people I’ve known for 34 years since I was 11. It’s crazy. These are the same people who sat behind us in the stadium in section 319 for years.”

“Friends family football food” his brother Mike added. “What more can you want?”

The former San Francisco 49ers defensive coordinator will stand on the sideline as a head coach for the first time looking to lead the Jets to a season-opening victory over the Panthers.

Hours before kickoff however Saleh brought a tradition that he's maintained throughout his entire coaching career to what is sure to be a memorable day at Bank of America Stadium.

Saleh was spotted running stairs. In fact he didn't just jog up a few sections to break a sweat the head coach and leader of this rebuild ran up the stadium steps around the entire lower bowl.

It's no surprise Saleh was getting a workout in like this hours before the game. The head coach was running stairs during the preseason as well even during a torrential downpour at MetLife Stadium.

Speaking about the tradition in the days leading up to Sunday's showdown with the Panthers Saleh revealed that he's been running stairs pregame since he was a graduate assistant at his first job.

""I was looking for something to do pregame when I was still young and in a lot better shape"" Saleh told reporters cracking a smile. ""I was trying to get a workout in and there’s no workout equipment and I wanted something difficult. So I started running stadiums in college and I just started doing it in the NFL when I got here. So it’s been over 20 years now.""

Sounds about right for a coach that preaches all gas and no brakes.

Saleh mentioned Lambeau Field in Green Bay and Levi's Stadium in San Francisco as venues that have been more challenging than others over the years. Even still jogging up the steps is light work compared to chasing around his kids at home.

""It's a lot easier"" Saleh said.

Magazines and newspaper editions featuring 9/11 coverage collected by the Las Vegas FBI division over the years as seen on Aug. 18 2021. (L.E. Baskow/Las Vegas Review-Journal) @Left_Eye_Images

Today marks the passage of 20 years since the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11 2001 the day that changed our nation — and our state.

Nearly 3000 people were killed on that day making it the deadliest foreign attack on American soil. Roughly 40 percent of them remain unidentified.

Following are some of the ways that 9/11 had an immediate and lasting impact on our state.

— Within hours of the attacks one of the largest most intense investigations in the history of the Las Vegas FBI division would unfold at a stunning speed. Four of the 19 hijackers had traveled to Las Vegas between May and August 2001. But why? The investigation concluded with no concrete answer though two prevailing theories have emerged in investigative reports. One suggests that the al-Qaida terrorists came to Las Vegas to scout potential targets. The other assumes they were in Las Vegas planning the attacks. Grant Ashley the special agent in charge at the time believes it to be the latter.

— The nation’s airspace was emptied for the first time in history instantly grounding about 70 local flights. More than 10000 people had to be cleared from McCarran International Airport that morning and sent back to their hotels. McCarran stayed closed and nearly empty until the morning of Sept. 13. when it reopened to even longer ticketing lines The first flight bound for Hawaii departed around noon.

— The instant travel interruption gave way to a sharp decline in tourism. In the two weeks following the attacks as many as 15000 employees were laid off from Las Vegas casinos. Several Strip properties shelved their expansion plans for months and in some cases even years. By spring 2002 some properties started to hire again though the fiscal year would end with about 6000 fewer casino jobs on the Strip.

— Visitors and locals alike eager to donate blood arrived at blood banks in such numbers that a cargo plane from the Nevada National Guard was dispatched to Puerto Rico to pick up more blood bags from a manufacturer.

— Car rental agencies and the downtown Las Vegas bus station were mobbed by visitors stranded by the airport’s closure. Local car dealerships even reported an uptick in business as some desperate travelers decided the only way out was to buy a car drive it home and sell it.

— By about 9 a.m. local time the order was given to close U.S. Highway 93 and clear all vehicles and visitors from the top of Hoover Dam for the first time since World War II. The highway reopened three days later but long-haul tractor-trailers were never allowed to cross the dam again.

— Palo Verde High School teacher Barbara Edwards 58 was the only full-time Las Vegas resident killed on the day of the attacks. Edwards was aboard American Airlines Flight 77 which slammed into the Pentagon in Washington D.C. Twenty years later the high school still hosts a ceremony in her honor each year to mark the anniversary of the attacks. Her son Scott said at this year’s ceremony: “I think she would be blown away and grateful but I also think she would say ‘Oh you guys don’t have to do this for me.’”

— Ron and Nancy May’s loss is a permanent part of the country’s historical record. Their daughter Renee a flight attendant on American Airlines Flight 77 is one of two people known to have placed phone calls from the aircraft before it crashed. She called her parents in Las Vegas at 6:12 a.m. local time to tell them her flight had been hijacked. Accounts of that final call are published in the 9/11 Commission Report.

— Ahead of the 20th anniversary nearly 15700 post-9/11 veterans were enrolled in the state’s two largest Veterans Affairs systems. Fifty-seven service members who listed Nevada as their home state have died in the war on terror according to a national database.

— As the real New York still smoldered a spontaneous memorial sprang to life in front of the fake version of the city on the Las Vegas Strip. The memorial outside New York-New York would swell to include more than 6000 items most of them T-shirts from police and fire departments across the country. For help hotel officials turned to UNLV to collect and catalog every item. Today the items are preserved in 491 boxes at the university’s library.

September 12 2021 Jon Sofen Senior Editor U.S.

Daniel Negreanu went eight years without winning a live poker tournament a stat that is still hard to believe. After Sunday's win in Poker Masters Event #5: $10000 No-Limit Hold'em for $178200 he now has two victories since June. And he just might have an old rival — Doug Polk — to thank for the recent success.

On July 11 Polk posted a video on his YouTube channel about the length of time it had been since Negreanu won a poker tournament. One day later ""Kid Poker"" scooped a $50000 buy-in PokerGO Cup event for $700000 and would eventually be crowned the overall series champion.

Fast forward exactly two months later to Sunday afternoon at the PokerGO Studio in Las Vegas and the GGPoker ambassador is back in the winner's circle. Negreanu beat out a field of 66 entrants to win his first ever Poker Masters event.

He earned 179 points for his second cash of the high roller series giving him 281 overall putting him atop the leaderboard in the race for the Purple Jacket. But there are still seven events remaining so it's still way too early for his fans to get too excited.

Polk's video likely had no impact on Negreanu finally getting over the hump to win a couple of tournaments. But it's still an odd coincidence either way.

2021 Poker Masters Event #5 Final Table Results

Place Player County Points Prize 1st Daniel Negreanu Canada 181 $178200 2nd Nick Petrangelo United States 132 $133000 3rd Vikenty Shegal United States 86 $66000 4th Jake Daniels United States 66 $69000 5th Jeffrey Trudeau United States 53 $52800

Rough Hand Ends Petrangelo's Run

During heads up play with both players relatively close in chips — Negreanu slightly out in front — one pseudo-cooler hand propelled the Poker Hall of Famer to victory.

Nick Petrangelo raised on the button to 180000 with A♣7♣ and his opponent three-bet to 600000 with A♦Q♣ and the raise was called. The flop came out Q♦A♠J♥ and Negreanu wasn't about to play small ball. He bet out 725000 and got a call. The turn was the 4♥ and both players interestingly checked.

On the river which was the 4♠ Negreanu went big betting out 1.8 million. Petrangelo made the call to find out the bad news and admitted the check on the turn was a tricky but strong play by his opponent. The hand left him with just 760000 less than 10 big blinds.

Moments later ""DNegs"" picked up A♠A♣ on the button and limped. Petrangelo took the bait and shoved all-in with Q♠10♠. The board came out clean for Negreanu — 4♣K♦5♥6♣K♣ — and that was all she wrote.

Negreanu the champion took home $178200 for his impressive performance and the runner-up received $133000. The PokerGO Studio also played host to Day 1 (of two) of Event #6: 10000 8-Game. Registration was still open at the time of publishing but 30 players had entered.

By Alan Snel of LVSportsBiz.com

Getting to Allegiant Stadium for Raiders games and events doesn’t have to be a nightmare. LVSportsBiz.com is here to dole out some advice on getting inside this stadium without getting brain damage.

Right off the top: Las Vegas is a car-centric car-first metro area where you might be used to driving your car to big oceans of asphalt at Thomas & Mack Center and Sam Boyd Stadium. You have to re-wire your brain and re-think the way you’re going to get to this stadium. For a 65000-seat stadium the number of parking spaces on the stadium footprint is ridiculously small. It’s the Raiders and the NFL so Clark County being Clark County gave the Raiders a nice break by allowing the stadium to be built on a site that’s woefully short in parking spaces.

So you’re going to have to be creative: In this context being creative means actually planning strategy to get to this stadium. The best advice is leave early and give yourself time. Think about getting to the venue at least two hours ahead of the event’s starting time. If you haven’t paid the $100 ahead of time to buy yourself a parking space on the site you might want to consider . . .

Taking an RTC Raiders game bus: In lots of big cities like Chicago New York or Washington DC taking public transportation is second nature to reach major league sports games. RTC has rolled out a special Raiders express bus service for game days and for the life of me I don’t understand why more people don’t take it. The roundtrip fare is a mere $4 and you let someone else take you to the game. And the bus lets you off on Dean Martin near a parking lot so it’s a five-minute walk. Here’s team president Dan Ventrelle at one of the express buses that leave from five convenient locations around the Las Vegas valley.

Off and running: The buses served 3250 round trips for the first preseason game when the Raiders hosted the Seattle Seahawks Aug. 14. The two most popular express routes came from the Red Rock hotel in Summerlin and Green Valley Ranch hotel in Henderson. Take a look at your routes:

Route 605 – Summerlin Game Day Express: Red Rock Casino Resort Spa  11011 W. Charleston Blvd. Las Vegas NV 89135

 11011 W. Charleston Blvd. Las Vegas NV 89135 Route 606 – Green Valley Game Day Express: Green Valley Ranch Resort Casino & Spa  2300 Paseo Verde Parkway Henderson 89052

 2300 Paseo Verde Parkway Henderson 89052 Route 607 – Centennial Hills Game Day Express: Santa Fe Station Hotel & Casino  4949 N. Rancho Dr. Las Vegas NV 89130

 4949 N. Rancho Dr. Las Vegas NV 89130 Route 609 – East Side Game Day Express: Boulder Station Hotel & Casino  4111 Boulder Highway Las Vegas NV 89121

 4111 Boulder Highway Las Vegas NV 89121 Route 612 – West Henderson Game Day Express: M Resort Spa Casino 12300 Las Vegas Blvd. South Henderson 89044

Walking on Hacienda Avenue to stadium: It’s going to be 100 degrees again Monday for Raiders vs Ravens and it’s even hotter in the sun when you walk Hacienda to the stadium. But it’s about a 15-minute walk from the Strip and you can cut through Mandalay Bay or the Luxor to reach Hacienda and hoof it on the pavement spanning I-15. Once over the bridge you turn left into the stadium site. It will be a lot more pleasant come November and December. It’s a hardship and even potentially a threat to your health to walk in this intense heat but enjoy the road that’s closed to cars. How often does this area close roads to cars so that walkers and bicyclists can safely use the road? Pretty much never.

The Strip can be your conduit: There are all types of ways to move along the Strip to reach Hacienda. You can take the MGM Resorts tram the monorail or the RTC deuce bus and walk your way to Hacienda and then to the stadium. There are lots of hotel parking lots too though they will cost you more than that RTC Raiders express bus.

Pedal to the stadium: You don’t have to ride your bicycle the whole way to the stadium from your home. Just find a quiet street west of the stadium park your car with your bike pop your bicycle off the vehicle and pedal five minutes to the stadium. It’s amazingly easy. I recall writing a story about the Seattle Mariners’ special bike-parking area in its parking garage next to the team’s ballpark in downtown Seattle. I remember biking to Coors Field in Denver and locking my bike on racks that were monitored by a security usher. Even good ol’ Wrigley Field had a small bicycle garage for people to park and lock their bikes. The stadium was not designed to handle a lot of bicycles. There are only two sets of bike racks for 10 total racks near two entrances. But bike racks are easy to install and if Clark County and the Raiders want to promote bicycling to the stadium that would help.

Hop a ride share: There’s always Uber and Lyft. Here’s a map showing the ride share lots. Keep in mind the stadium could sometimes switch the rideshare locations through the season.

Oh by the way: And if you’re attending the Raiders MNF game make sure you’re vaccinated. It’s a Raiders requirement to get inside the big domed stadium. But once inside you don’t have to wear masks though you can if you’d like. The Raiders will have a tent on the north side of the stadium if you have issues with the CLEAR app that you have to use to show your proof of COVID vaccination.

New Yorkers gathered together with three presidents at the National September 11 Memorial in Lower Manhattan on Saturday morning to mourn the 2977 people who were killed 20 years ago in the Sept. 11 2001 terrorist attacks.

President Joe Biden along with former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama came to the annual memorial service which features the ongoing reading of the victims’ names.

The tribute featured moments of silence to mark the progression of the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center the Pentagon and United Airlines Flight 93 20 years ago as well as musical performances from Bruce Springsteen and Kelli O’Hara among others.

Throughout the ceremony families and friends of the 9/11 victims gathered at the reflecting pools marking the footprints of the fallen World Trade Center’s Twin Towers to mourn reflect and remember those who died that fateful day two decades ago.

A former Defence Forces firing range in Oranmore outside Galway city has been selected by the IDA as the ‘preferred site’ for the chip fabrication facility which would employ twice as many people as the US multinational’s existing Irish facility in Leixlip The Sunday Times reported.

Leas chathaoirleach of Galway County Council Jim Cuddy told Independent.ie: “It’s a site shortlisted by the IDA.

“This particular project is a 128 acre site where the army used to go training on the outskirts of Oranmore village.

“It’s close to the village. And it would be a very welcome development. It would certainly be a shot in the arm for the local area.

“People would just be able to get off the M6 motorway and within two minutes they’d be at work.

“It would be a great boost to the area and hopefully it would bring an amount of funding to Oranmore to allow for the necessary infrastructure which would be vital including wastewater systems. This will hopefully focus attention on the work that’s needed.”

Councillor Cuddy said Oranmore had not “suffered more than any other community” in Ireland during the pandemic

But the local politician believed the facility could be a real game changer for local people who once had to travel to cities including Galway city for work.

“Local people wouldn’t have to negotiate their way into Galway city or anywhere further afield to get to work” Cllr Cuddy said.

“It would cut down travelling time people wouldn’t be stuck in traffic. It would improve people’s quality of life.

“People would choose to live in the area as well and that would be good for the community.

“I’m a strong advocate that jobs shouldn’t all be based in cities they should be based in local counties.

“Regional employment is vital to allow people to live locally to stay in their local communities. “And for anyone moving here there are very good education facilities in Oranmore and Claregalway Athenry and in nearby Galway city.

“It’s not definite yet it’s only still a proposal but it would be such a welcome boost.

“There won’t be anything more on this until the end of the year I imagine.”

Fine Gael TD Hildegarde Naughton told Independent.ie; “Were Intel to locate its new multi-billion-euro plant in Oranmore in Galway it would be the greatest shot in the arm for Galway and the West in the history of the state.

“The potential can’t be overstated. Not only would it create employment it would be transformative for all the suppliers and the service industry in the region.

“It’s on state owned lands it’s readily accessible via the M6 motorway and the train station in Oranmore and Galway city.

""While no decision has been made – it is ultimately a decision for Intel – the IDA (Industrial Development Agency) are completely behind the project and I’ve written to Martin Shanahan CEO of the IDA expressing my support for this project.”

The Sunday Times cited sources who said the 216-hectare rifle range had been selected as a potential location for the ‘mega-fab’ semiconductor plant which would involve building eight factory modules – known as ‘fabs’ on a single campus which is 20 minutes by car from Galway city.

Intel chief executive Pat Gelsinger last week visited Intel in Leixlip with Taoiseach Micheál Martin and told reporters an Irish site had made it onto the shortlist of the final ten locations being considered.

In Germany this month Mr Gelsinger said Intel wanted to “build a big honkin’ fab in Europe” which he said could cost up to €80 billion employ 10000 and support another 90000 jobs.

The mega-fab would be the most advanced chip foundry in the world and would allow outside firms – such as car-makers – to have chips they had designed themselves manufactured by Intel.

“Ireland is clearly on that list” Gelsinger told RTÉ in Leixlip.

“We have gotten nominations for sites from across European countries some 70 different sites. We are down to about ten finalists now that have sort of met the bar and Ireland is clearly one of those.”

The site is not far from one in Athenry which Apple walked away from after it ran into planning difficulties.",,,,,,,,,,,,

While some estimates suggest one in three flies used in Europe are made in Kenya and millions are shipped to other key markets the country’s fly fishing tourism industry is ripe for expansion

By Nick Perry / AFP MATHIOYA Kenya





With the nimbleness of a younger man John Ngaii Moses skillfully knotted a tiny fishing fly onto his line and hopping over mossy rocks cast off into a surging river flowing through Kenyan tea country.

“I can tie a fly at night without a light” the 60-year-old fisherman said with a grin flicking his line with a graceful arc into the pristine waters.

Moses is something of a rarity in Kenya where fishing for recreation is neither popular nor widely understood and even viewed warily as a vestige of colonial times.

Yet the country occupies a special place in the world of fly fishing and enthusiasts believe demystifying the sport could create jobs and encourage future generations to protect rivers.

Kenya boasts one of Africa’s oldest fishing clubs and a fly tying industry that for decades has supplied fishers from Norway to New Zealand with hand-crafted lures.

Visitors come from all over the world to fish in its highland rivers and alpine lakes where the British introduced trout in the early 1900s.

Fish do not draw tourists like the big cats on Kenya’s savannas but what is on offer for the intrepid fisher is no less remarkable.

Just two hours’ drive from Nairobi where the Mathioya River crashes beneath the Aberdare Range prime fishing country meets wilderness inhabited by black rhinos and elephants.

“Imagine spending the morning ... fishing and the afternoon out taking pictures of wild animals. Where else can you have this?” said Zac Gichane owner of Aberdare Cottages and Fishing Lodge a resort overlooking the Mathioya.

He said fly fishing was a multibillion-dollar global industry ripe for expansion in Kenya.

“It is God’s country. Two hours from Nairobi and you find crystal-clear rivers a peaceful village greenery... The opportunities here are limitless” Gichane said.

Gichane sources his fishing flies from Kenyan crafters whose delicate and elaborate creations have become a mainstay for anglers worldwide.

These artificial lures — some so small they perch on a fingertip — are designed to imitate the particular insects that trout salmon and other species feast on.

Moses prefers the “royal coachman” — traditionally dressed with feathers and a tail — because it resembles a butterfly native to the Mathioya that brings trout to the surface.

Reliable data is scant but some estimates suggest one in three flies used in Europe originate in Kenya while millions more are shipped to the US Canada and other key fishing markets.

“It is a big business in Kenya. It employs a lot of people” said John Nyapola who owns Ojoo Fishing Flies Designers.

In his small workshop outside Nairobi flamingo feathers rabbit pelts and all manner of furs and fabrics litter an assembly table where custom orders from Canada Australia and Japan are individually hand-tied.

“We have made them all” said Jane Auma a veteran fly tier with 32 years of experience pointing to a well-worn catalog detailing 1000 individual lure designs.

Their names — such as “Woolly Bugger” “Copper John” and “Irresistible Adams” — are as baffling to most tiers as the sport itself.

“We do fish but we don’t use flies. We use nets and we try and catch everything” Auma said laughing.

Fly fishers by contrast mostly return whatever they catch to the river to prevent overfishing.

Gichane said the catch-and-release ethos is considered “madness” by Kenyans who fish for food.

Some also dismiss the sport as a strange import.

Decades ago the Mathioya valley was a hotbed of anti-colonial resistance and suffered British reprisals.

Gichane said that before independence in 1963 — and even for a time after — many Kenyans would not dare pick up a rod.

“They think sport fishing is for mzungus [white people] not for Africans” said Moses who was born in a British internment camp and is today a fishing guide.

The Kenya Fly Fishers’ Club a private 102-year-old establishment on the Mathioya has sought to broaden the sport’s appeal.

The club has welcomed more Kenyan members as interest has grown and elected its first black chairman in 2018.

“Times are changing — same as fly fishing. Right now we have a lot of local indigenous Kenyans who are fishing. I am one of them” said Musa Ibrahim a trustee and 20-year member of the club.

It has also reached out to local schools to introduce children to fly fishing and its conservation aspects such as replenishing the Mathioya with trout.

Kenya at its prime was criss-crossed by 2000km of unspoiled trout-fishing rivers but rapid land conversion reduced that 10-fold Ibrahim said.

“It’s up to us to make sure that we leave the legacy for the next generation” he said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Nadella's laser focus on cloud computing has been made clear over his seven years as CEO. Last year he even joked that he should be referring to Windows as ""Azure Edge"" insinuating the 36-year-old operating system on your PC is an extension of the company's Azure cloud computing service that just happens to live outside Microsoft's data centers.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

Gauging Windows' impact on the company's cloud business and what it contributes to Microsoft overall is increasingly pressing as the new Windows 11 operating system is set to launch in October. The launch comes just as the pandemic-driven PC boom is coming to an end and chip shortages have caused decreases in consumer Windows revenue.

Analysts have noted that Windows doesn't pull the same weight on the company's balance sheet now that cloud revenues are steadily growing. The operating system is lumped in with Microsoft's ""More Personal Computing"" revenue segment which also includes Xbox Surface hardware and Bing search advertising. That segment accounted for $14 billion of the $46 billion total revenue Microsoft booked for the latest quarter ending June 30.

""Windows is becoming increasingly less and less relevant to Microsoft's financial success"" said Brad Reback who covers Microsoft as an analyst at Stifel. He says the diminishing fiscal impact of Windows has two facets: An increasing percentage of the company's revenue comes from cloud services like Azure and Microsoft 365 combined with Microsoft's decision to give Windows 11 out as a free upgrade.

""The reality is people don't pay for operating systems anymore at least on the consumer side"" Reback said.

Microsoft traditionally required users to buy new versions of its operating system until Windows 10 which followed Apple's lead of offering the new update for free. Microsoft is also increasingly coming around to Apple's annual update cycle model rather than iteratively improving the software year-round in smaller releases.

But that doesn't mean Windows is worthless to Microsoft. Dan Ives an analyst at Wedbush says Windows is still important because it encourages an ecosystem of Microsoft developers.

""I view it as an on-ramp to the cloud highway. Microsoft has significantly narrowed the gap compared to Amazon when it comes to the cloud arms race because of its embedded install base with Windows as well as the Office family suite"" Ives said.

One key part of Windows 11 is the tools catering towards developers he said; For instance Microsoft is adding better window management with its ""Snap Layouts"" which allows power users to quickly dispatch applications to pre-set positions on the screen.

Microsoft is also revamping its own app store on Windows giving developers favorable revenue sharing terms and finally using the platform to distribute its own first-party apps like the Visual Studio development environment. This gives the company the opportunity to build revenue around an app platform like Apple has done on iOS though the ability to install apps from anywhere means the Microsoft Store will always lag behind Apple's App Store.

And ultimately a new version of Windows replete with new features and promises of productivity gains keeps people in Microsoft's world.

""Windows and upgrades like Windows 11 are important in terms of keeping the developer community enterprises as well as consumers as part of the shift as Microsoft takes its underpinnings to the cloud"" Ives said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpZmV3aXJlLmNvbS93aGF0LWlzLW9uZWRyaXZlLWFuZC1ob3ctZG9lcy1pdC13b3JrLTUwOTM2MzPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What Is OneDrive and How Does It Work?,"OneDrive is a cloud storage service from Microsoft.

A reader argues that Sony’s purchase of Spider-Man and Ratchet & Clank developer Insomniac is better value for money than Microsoft buying Bethesda.

I’m sure there are some fanboys that will have pretended otherwise but I think most reasonable people would agree that the PlayStation Showcase was an extremely well put together event and that the vast majority of games looked very good. There were no major disappointments and several surprises. As far as I’m concerned it couldn’t have gone much better.

The biggest surprise was undoubtedly Marvel’s Wolverine. Seeing Spider-Man 2 was always an outside chance but getting a Wolverine game as well was a real shock especially as they’re both by Insomniac Games. Now neither game seems like it’s going to be out for at least two years but it’s still surprising that one studio could be working on two major games at once like that especially as they already released both Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart and Spider-Man: Miles Morales within the same seven month period.

And let’s not forget that those seven months were during a pandemic and the launch window of a brand new console – and also that the games have some of the best graphics ever seen. And now Insomniac are working on two more. I don’t know another developer that could match that in terms of quantity of quality. And the thing is Sony only paid $229 million for them. An amount of money that according to recent news is the cost of a single AAA next gen game.

I’m sure Insomniac’s bosses got all kinds of stock options and what not – nobody major seems to have left the company since the acquisition – but that is such a steal it’s not even funny. By comparison Microsoft paid $7.5 billion for Bethesda. For Bethesda a company that was a laughing stock only a couple of years ago for Fallout 76 and who’s top selling franchises – The Elder Scrolls and Fallout – have no new sequels due for at least three years.

To put that figure in context Disney only paid for $4 billion for Lucasfilm not just Star Wars but all the other films like Indiana Jones and ILM too. Now Lucas gave them favourable terms because he wanted to make sure he sold up to a company he trusted which is probably what happened to Insomniac as well but boy did Bethesda see Microsoft coming. That acquisition was a steal too but for the developer this time – not the publisher.

Unlike Insomniac Bethesda is more than one studio (I’d put MachineGames and Arkane Studios well above Bethesda Game Studios) but hilariously the next two Bethesda games are both PlayStation 5 exclusives. So not only will Sony have paid a fraction of the amount that Microsoft did for Bethesda but Insomniac are going to end up making more games for them in the first five years than all of Bethesda’s studios put together!

To me this underlines the fact that Microsoft still feels very much like an inexperienced newcomer to the games industry even though they’ve been in it for 20 years now. The PlayStation has only been around for five extra years and yet Sony seems so much more experienced and astute. They don’t spend money unnecessarily (in part because they haven’t got it to waste unlike Microsoft) and they don’t make rash decisions.

I’m not suggesting for a second that they’re perfect – everything to do with pricing and upgrades this gen has been a shambles and I think it’s only pride that’s stopping them from having a PlayStation Game Pass – but the impression they give is of a company with a plan. Whereas Microsoft just run around acting like a teenager with their parent’s credit card.



To make all these big budget games at once Insomniac must’ve greatly increased in size and that’s something Sony must’ve helped with quietly and sensibly behind the scenes. That’s how you do it and they’re already reaping the benefits.

The thing is I can’t even pretend to be a big fan of Ratchet & Clank but I love how polished all of Insomniac’s stuff is and the Spider-Man game was fantastic. So well done to them and well done to Sony for knowing how to spend their money sensibly.

Although many of the updates mentioned in the roadmap don’t say too much about what exactly they bring there are a couple worth highlighting.

The most important is probably the addition of the first Local Legend plane  the Junkers JU-52 which should have been released along with World Update VI but got delayed at the last moment.We have now learned that Asobo Studio plans to release the highly anticipated Junkers JU-52 aircraft on September 28. Keep in mind that the Local Legend plane will be available for purchase individually for $15 it will not come for free.Furthermore Microsoft Flight Simulator devs revealed that since the Maverick: Top Gun expansion has been pushed to May 2022  it now has time for two major updates: Sim Update VI and Sim Update VII/Reno Air Races.Although no details about SIM Update VI have been revealed yet the roadmap revealed today confirms it will drop sometime in late October along with several other updates.As far as Sim Update VI/Reno Air Races update goes these will be launched in mid-November according to the roadmap. The Reno Air Races will introduce the ability to race against friends and other players from around the world in Microsoft Flight Simulator.The update is being developed in partnership with RARA (the Reno Air Racing Association) and will bring the STIHL National Championship Air Races the world’s fastest motorsport to the game.Finally Microsoft has partnered with Volocopter a German company known for creating the eVTOL (electric vertical take-off and landing) air taxi for urban flights called VoloCity. These electric air taxis will be added to Microsoft Flight Simulator sometime in November as the first step toward the addition of one of the widely-requested aircraft the helicopter."

The study published in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report suggests that Moderna was 95 percent effective at preventing hospitalization among adults ages 18 and older.

The effectiveness rate for Moderna against urgent care and emergency room visits sits at 92%. Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson have rates of 77% and 65% respectively.

“These real-world data show that vaccines remain highly effective at reducing Covid-19 related hospitalization and emergency department visits even in the presence of the new Covid-19 variant” said researcher Shaun Grannis from Indiana University in the US.

“We strongly recommend vaccinations for all who are eligible to reduce serious illness and ease the burden on our healthcare system” Grannis added.

The team also found that Pfizer was 80 percent effective at preventing hospitalization among adults ages 18 and older. While Johnson & Johnson was 60 percent effective.

For the study the team analyzed more than 32000 medical encounters from nine states during June July and August 2021 when the Delta variant became the predominant strain.

The results showed that unvaccinated individuals with Covid-19 are 5-7 times more likely to need emergency department care or hospitalization similar to the overall effectiveness prior to the variant.

The study also found that vaccine effectiveness is lower for people 75 years and older which has not been shown in previous research.

This could be due to a range of factors including the increased time since vaccination the researchers noted.

“These findings reaffirm the high protection of COVID-19 vaccines against moderate and severe COVID-19 resulting in Emergency Department Urgent Care and hospital visits and underscore the importance of full COVID-19 vaccination and continued benefits of COVID-19 vaccination during Delta variant predominance” the report said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5sYXRlc3RseS5jb20vcXVpY2tseS93b3JsZC9tb2Rlcm5hLXMtY292aWQtMTktdmFjY2luZS1tb3JlLWVmZmVjdGl2ZS1hZ2FpbnN0LWRlbHRhLXZhcmlhbnQtdGhhbi1wZml6ZXItam9obnNvbi1hbXAtam9obnNvbi1zdHVkeS0yODM4NTM2Lmh0bWzSAZkBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubGF0ZXN0bHkuY29tL3F1aWNrbHkvd29ybGQvbW9kZXJuYS1zLWNvdmlkLTE5LXZhY2NpbmUtbW9yZS1lZmZlY3RpdmUtYWdhaW5zdC1kZWx0YS12YXJpYW50LXRoYW4tcGZpemVyLWpvaG5zb24tYW1wLWpvaG5zb24tc3R1ZHktMjgzODUzNi5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,World News | ⚡Moderna's COVID-19 Vaccine More Effective Against Delta Variant Than Pfizer Johnson & Johnson: Study,Moderna's vaccine for Covid-19 is significantly more effective against the Delta variant of the SARS-CoV2 virus than Pfizer or Johnson & Johnson suggests a new study.,,,,,,

During the early days of the strike which first began on Aug. 10 when 200 members of the Bakery Confectionery Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers International Union Local 364 walked out of their bakery jobs the contracted security guards would mostly huddle in small groups on the company’s grounds or meander around the plant property staying far away from strikers along Northeast Columbia Boulevard.

But the security guards have come increasingly more involved with the protesters—both by using intimidation techniques and getting increasingly physical with union members as well as with outside protesters.

The standoff between the baker’s union and Mondelez International the plant’s owner escalated 10 days ago when the company sent a cease-and-desist letter to local union leadership on Sept. 2 threatening legal action. The union’s attorney disagreed. Mondelez’s attorneys also called the union’s business agent Cameron Taylor to signal they would be seeking a temporary restraining order against the union. (Four days later Mondelez told the union’s attorney Margaret Olney it would not be pursuing the order—for now.)

The security guards wear blue uniforms Huffmaster baseball caps and black boots. A little patch on the side of each of their shirts reads “Huffmaster Crisis Response” and patches on the front of the shirt read either “Security Guard” or “Security Officer.”

Sources have shared a dozen videos and images that demonstrate a shift in how Mondelez’s contracted security guards are acting toward strikers and supporters of the strike.

One picture shows two male security guards on Sept. 2 standing within inches on either side of a female striker Regina Klavano who’s holding a picket sign by the railroad tracks—where until last week when police ordered them to move strikers were camped to stop supply trains containing flour sugar and oil from entering the bakery.

A video from that day shows a line of seven strikers standing beside the railroad holding signs. A line of six Huffmaster guards stand closely behind them hands on their belt loops or laced behind their backs. Another guard about 10 feet away from the line of guards holds a camcorder and records the scene.

Huffmaster’s website says that it trains security guards to document strike behavior including potentially illegal activities.

Another video shows two security guards pushing strikers away from a van entering the facility carrying strikebreakers.

Huffmaster and Mondelez did not respond to WW’s requests for comment.

Nonunion protesters sympathetic to the strikers have been taking more aggressive actions recently by impeding strikebreaking vans and buses from exiting and entering an external parking lot that Mondelez leased several miles from the facility.

Last Wednesday morning at 5:30 a group of eight strike supporters parked cars at the two entrances of the remote parking lot where strikebreakers gathered to catch a bus to the Nabisco plant. The idea was to block the strikebreakers in the lot so they couldn’t get to work.

The protesters say that the bus driver kept driving forward slowly to break through the blockade. Protesters say a group of six Huffmaster security guards pushed elbowed and shoved the protesters away and tried to wrest picket signs out of their hands as they blocked the bus. When the bus reached the cars the strikebreakers inside the bus got off and walked past the cars to smaller vans that then took them to the bakery.

Police eventually showed up and told the protesters they could not block the parking lot exits with cars.

Union representatives are meeting with the company in Baltimore this week to bargain.

Meanwhile Huffmaster has posted jobs for food production facilities in multiple cities across the country which Local 364 members say match their job descriptions exactly.

Mikayla Temple WSYM 2021. The new turf arena can be used for archery tag or nerf gun wars.

The entertainment facility that opened in the Meridian Mall in 2019 was known for its go-kart track and ax throwing.

“Jordan Munsters the president of the company he’s always had a dream of opening up a go-kart track” said General Manager Zach Bingham. “He got in touch with the Meridian Mall they got connected they gave him on what they thought would be cool to go along with the go-kart track.”

Mikayla Temple WSYM 2021. People watch as a group plays archery tag in the new turf arena.

But now they have a lot more.

“It went from a go-kart track that had tires all around to us having top of the line pro-tech barriers to having a sweet bar that has bottoms up beer” Bigham said.

With their new $2 million 25000-square-foot expansion they upgraded what they had.

“There’s just so much to do"" Bingham said. ""Gamified axe throwing where you get to hunt zombies you get to play tic tac toe connect four or you can do a target.”

And added a few new features like an assault arena for archery tag and Nerf wars.

Mikayla Temple WSYM 2021. High Caliber added throw bowling which is bowling with a football.

There's also more throw bowling and a new bar.

“The Double Clutch Bar that we have over there it has 32 taps of beer with craft beer with Ellison Brewery and all those other breweries around the area” Bingham said.

Local artists painted murals around the new space including inside the two new VIP lounges.

“Oh my gosh Luke Walker did such an amazing job in there with those two murals in there and it’s beautiful” Bingham said.

Mikayla Temple WSYM 2021. One of two new VIP lounges.

Bingham said having to shut down because of the pandemic set them back on the expansion construction.

“It took a few months and we didn’t open up exactly the time we wanted to but we still opened up nice and early before the holidays” Bingham said.

They plan to keep adding to the expansion with more local art new arcade games and an outdoor patio in the spring.

“There’s going to be a lot of cool things for people to see and experience out here” Bingham said.

Mikayla Temple WSYM 2021. Ranae Selmeyer painted this mural in the building. The artwork around the facility was done by different local artists.

Ax throwing and throw bowling are part of a package deal the entertainment center offers with unlimited play all day for $35.

The new expansion is open but the official grand opening is Saturday Sept. 18 at noon where they plan to have a monster truck flamethrowers and Monster Energy Drink on site with free energy drinks.

Unlocking the Full Potential of Financial Wellness Benefits was released Sept. 11 at the SHRM Annual Conference & Expo 2021 taking place in Las Vegas and virtually.



To determine the current state of financial well-being in the U.S. as well as how employers are responding to this new imperative in June 2021 SHRM and Morgan Stanley surveyed 1000 working Americans 1000 unemployed Americans who lost or left their job since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and 1205 HR professionals.

Meeting Employees' Needs



Nearly 3 in 4 (74 percent) HR professionals surveyed said their organization has not added new benefits or expanded existing benefits to help employees manage their financial stress since the start of the pandemic. At the same time American workplaces are seeing record employee turnover with more U.S. workers quitting their jobs than at any time in at least two decades.

Workers who believe their employers don't care about their well-being—physical emotional and financial—often feel less engaged at work and are more likely to seek employment elsewhere. This may especially be true when they are experiencing anxiety about their financial situation.



A Range of Benefits



The most common financial wellness benefits offered by employers were:

Retirement savings plans (offered by 95 percent of HR professionals' organizations)



Safety net insurance such as life and disability insurance (89 percent).

Fewer employers offer the following benefits:

Financial planning for long-term security such as sessions with a financial advisor on wealth management investments and estate planning (35 percent).



Financial coaching on the basics of personal finance such as advice about personal budgeting savings debt and credit management (24 percent).



Emergency savings funds (15 percent).

The surveyed HR professionals who offered these financial wellness benefits indicated that the offerings are being used more since the start of the pandemic especially emergency funds (cited by 24 percent) financial planning (20 percent) and financial coaching (22 percent).





Employees' Differing Needs The existing workforce and the future workforce—which includes the currently unemployed—have different financial needs and values so organizations that seek to retain current employees and hire from among the unemployed may need to adopt different strategies for these two groups.

Education Benefits

Education benefits—such as tuition reimbursement 529 plans and employer-provided student loan repayment—are offerings that employees value highly: 18 percent of working Americans consider these one of the most important employer-sponsored financial wellness benefits for their financial needs and goals the survey showed.



Just over 1 in 10 HR professionals (11 percent) say the use of education coverage has increased since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic while 14 percent say their employer plans to focus on these benefits in the coming year.

Large organizations with 5000 or more employees are more likely to offer education benefits (73 percent do so) than organizations with fewer than 500 employees (36 percent).

The Society for Human Resource Management supports expanding employer-provided education assistance to include student loan repayment and the monetary limit increased to give employers flexibility in the design of benefit offerings for recruitment and retention purposes.



""SHRM has long championed policies that allow employers to offer education assistance programs relevant to the modern workforce"" said James Redstone director of public policy at SHRM. ""Greater certainty regarding the tax treatment of education assistance is an important step in expanding the availability of such benefits.""



Emergency Funds vs. Retirement Savings

Although just 15 percent of surveyed HR professionals said their employer offered emergency funds—typically in the form of payroll advances or emergency savings funded through payroll deductions—45 percent of unemployed Americans and 16 percent of working Americans feel this is one of the most important employer-sponsored financial wellness benefits.

The much larger number of unemployed who value emergency funds seems to indicate this is a benefit that becomes more valued in the midst of job loss.

Of HR professionals whose organization offers emergency funds nearly 1 in 4 (24 percent) indicated the use of emergency funds has increased since the start of the pandemic. However just 6 percent of HR professionals said their employer plans to focus on emergency funds in the next year to address employee financial stress.

""Employer interest in emergency savings programs lies both in the direct potential benefit to workers as well as a benefit to employers in the form of higher employee satisfaction"" said Craig Copeland senior research associate at the nonprofit Employee Benefit Research Institute. Addressing short-term savings needs ""could lead to better long-term results as emergency savings—distinct from retirement savings—could help preserve assets in [defined contribution retirement] plans that otherwise might be tapped for emergencies.""

""Sometimes the most effective solutions are the most basic"" said Susan Shoemaker a retirement advisor working in the Southfield Mich. CAPTRUST office. ""While it takes time encouraging a participant to save enough to cover at least three months' expenses is the most practical approach to heading off an emergency.""

Women at Higher Risk

Thirty-five percent of surveyed working women said their financial health or situation had suffered due to the pandemic compared to 23 percent of working men.

Apart from the pandemic the report cited factors contributing to the gender gap in financial well-being such as:

Wage inequity. Women are disproportionately represented in lower-wage jobs according to Pew Research Center.



Family responsibilities. Women take more breaks from the workforce to care for family Pew Research Center also noted.



Life span. Women live longer and therefore must invest more into retirement according to the National Center for Health Statistics.

""Even though it is significantly smaller than it once was the gender pay gap remains and is having a significant impact on women's ability to save for retirement"" the U.S. Government Accountability Office recently reported.

Retention Strategy

Employers can use financial wellness programs as part of an employee retention strategy the report explains by assessing the financial needs of the workforce and then taking steps to:

Identify short-term goals such as engaging more employees in the program or researching other financial wellness programs.



Identify long-term goals such as making changes to the current financial wellness program.



Establish metrics to measure success such as utilization rates program costs employee retention contributions to retirement plans automatic savings programs and health saving accounts as well as employee feedback regarding financial stress levels debt levels retirement readiness and financial literacy.

Employee Communications

Many employees have a limited understanding of the benefits available to them or how helpful these offerings can be to their financial health. SHRM's report advises employers to:

Adopt a compelling communication strategy. In addition to one-on-one advice seminars and online tools effective communication is key to a successful financial wellness program. This can be achieved by creating a financial wellness logo or slogan or an infographic pointing to research on the benefits of financial wellness programs.

Between Free Comic Book Day (Aug. 14) and Granite State Comic Con (Sept. 18-19) Manchester Ink Link will be showcasing these entrepreneurial nerds who have opened comic and toy shops started selling aftermarket comic books and collectibles or offering professional photography that specializes in cosplay to name a few.

DUNBARTON NH – About eight years ago Dunbarton resident Matt DiMasi decided on a lark one day to create an impromptu mosaic of Captain America on a wall in his mother’s house.

He drew an outline of the character and filled it in with big pieces of tile.

“It was a kind of crude method back then” DiMasi recalls.

Little did he know then that the diverting project would become an artistic career that would lead him to recreate scores of classic comic book covers in large mosaic form and have some of those real-world mosaics converted into printed variant covers on limited-run comic books.

At first DiMasi started out small. He did some custom backsplashes behind the kitchen sinks of a few homes depicting things like a dolphin a bear a golden retriever and the Old Man of the Mountain.

Somewhere in there DiMasi made another comic-book-themed mosaic this time of the X-Men hero Wolverine on a four-foot-by-three-foot frame built by his brother-in-law. And he brought it into Double Midnight Comics in Manchester to show co-owner Brett Parker.

After that he was encouraged to do more. He refined his craft using smaller tile pieces he cuts himself using tile nippers and focused on replicating classic comic book covers of noteworthy issues. He scans the original art recreates it as a grid on a large frame and freehands the linework. After assembling the tile pieces together and filling the gaps with grout he has the frame professionally painted.

He started the company Shattered Comics LLC and has been making mosaics ever since.

“I think I’ve now done I would say between 25 and 30” DiMasi said.

The first one he did was a replica of Detective Comics #27 which was Batman’s first appearance. DiMasi said he would post his work on Facebook and started getting attention from folks in the comics industry.

Batman artist Kelly Jones in California reached out to him online and expressed interest in DiMasi’s work he said. He made Jones a mosaic of Detective Comics #651 and in exchange Jones gifted him an original drawing of Batman and his nemesis Bane.

Later he gifted mosaics of Spawn to creator Todd McFarlane and of Batman: The Dark Knight Returns to creator Frank Miller.

He’s also sold a few mosaics for between $10000 to $20000 apiece.

“I’ve only sold a handful. I still have most of them” DiMasi said.

Around 2017 or so DiMasi teamed up with Josh Jeppi son of comic distribution giant Diamond owner Steve Jeppi to rep his art though a spinoff company called Diamond International Galleries (DIG). The two did a television interview in Baltimore which garnered the attention of the editors at Marvel who offered a deal to make Shattered Comics store variants.

Variants are comic books with alternative cover art usually by different artists often printed in limited runs for collectible value. While most variants are commissioned by the publisher and created in a work-for-hire model DiMasi makes “store variants” which he pays for and distributes through a third party.

At first people didn’t realize that the Shattered variants were based on a real-life mosaic and not computer-generated.

“I have a photographer that comes to the house and she will do high-res image in outdoor light” DiMasi said. “And then that image is sent to Marvel to do the comic book.”

He said they generally print a minimum of 3000 issues per variant cover and sometimes smaller runs of different color variations.

For the most part the books are sold and distributed to stores by Connecticut-based The Comic Mint.

DiMasi said he does a couple of these each year. The latest to drop was last Sept. 1.

“We just put out Ultimate Fallout #4 which is the first Miles Morales” DiMasi said of the facsimile book of the 2011 original.

DiMasi said he’s been a fan of comics since the 1970s in Beverly Mass. when his cousin got him into it.

“Comics I’ve been into since I was a kid” he said.

He briefly owned a store in Concord called Shattered Comics from 2015 to 2017.

“It was more to get the art on the wall. And I wanted to sell vintage comics but I didn’t want to do the new comics and the games” DiMasi said. “I was doing it more for the enjoyment of it.”

Today he has an appointment-only storefront in Campton.

He still buys and sells vintage comic books through eBay and through his friend Peter Swain’s store RePetes Comics in Belmont.

DiMasi said the demand for old comic books has “exploded” recently which he attributes to a perfect storm of 1990s nostalgia speculation investment from other sectors like sports cards investors and growing curiosity in source material as once-obscure characters like Ant-Man and Groot enter the public consciousness through Marvel movies and Disney Plus shows.

DiMasi used to bring some of his mosaics to big comic conventions like New York Comic Con but stopped doing it because of the logistic headache (they each weigh about 70 pounds).

But he hopes to someday do a complete gallery show with each mosaic beside its original comic.

“I think it would be neat to have them all in one location” DiMasi said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3Zpc2lvbi5jby51Zy9hcnRpY2xlZGV0YWlscy8xMTQ1NjUvbmFyby1kZXZlbG9wcy1zdXBlcmlvci1jYXNzYXZhLXZhcmlldGllc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NARO develops superior cassava varieties,"The National Agricultural Research Organisation (NARO) has developed new cassava varieties which according to scientists have superior cooking industrial and disease-resistant qualities.

The varieties were developed at the National Crops Resources Research Institute (NaCRRI) Namulonge a research body under NARO tasked with developing improved crop types that meet the changing needs of farmers and other stakeholders.

According to the application for variety release document from NaCRRI three superior cassava varieties have been submitted to the National Variety Release Committee and are awaiting approval. The new varieties are offspring of NAROCASS1 a commercial variety released in 2016 and currently grown by farmers; Kibaha an introduction from Tanzania and several other breeding lines.

Dr Robert Kawuki a cassava breeder at NaCRRI said the new cassava varieties have good cooking attributes elevated resistance to viral diseases especially cassava mosaic and brown streak diseases whiteflies as well as drought resilience compared to varieties currently on the market.

The new varieties include UG120193 which has a sweet taste soft early maturity (12 months) high dry matter content high yield of about 20-25 tonnes/hectare as well as high resistance to cassava mosaic and cassava brown streak disease.

There is UG120156 with a sweet taste very soft early maturity (12 months) yield of 20-25 tonnes per hectare and very high resistance levels to cassava mosaic disease and cassava brown streak disease.

There is also Mkumba with high dry matter content superior resistance to cassava whitefly cassava mosaic disease cassava brown streak disease and yield of 20-25 tonnes per hectare.

“UG120156 and UG120193 are exceptional for boiling making flourbased meal and have high starch content for industrial use. Mkumba on the other hand is desirable for making flour-based meal as well as industrial use because of its high starch content.

“Mkumba UG120156 and UG120193 will take on official names of NAROCASS3 NAROCASS4 and NAROCASS5 respectively upon successful release by the committee” states the NaCRRI application for variety release report.

“Currently there is increasing demand for cassava with good cooking qualities like softness mealiness as well as high starch content for both food and industrial use. The endusers are our customers need cassava varieties that must taste well soft and mealy. Equally the industries want varieties with high starch content in order to maximise on their returns” he said. Kawuki said these quality attributes guided the breeding process.

Dr Christopher Omongo the root crops programme leader at NaCCRI expects the new varieties to be released soon by the National Variety Release Committee and advised farmers to keep growing NAROCASS1 until the three varieties are officially released.

He said the new varieties will be availed through the different NARO dissemination platforms like the well-trained lead farmers where these varieties were evaluated certified commercial cassava seed entrepreneurs and zonal agricultural research and development institutes.

(NASDAQ:SOFI) Looks Cheap Thanks to Market's Overreaction,"By Stjepan Kalinic

After going through a combination of lockup expiry and uneventful earnings in August SoFi Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ: SOFI) held the line at US$14 level. While the stock is still struggling to break above US$16 we can probably agree that it is doing better than expected.

Yet in the face of the latest rating we will examine our take on the intrinsic value through the discounted cash flow (DCF) method.

Check out our latest analysis for SoFi Technologies

The Latest Outlook

With the worst arguably behind the company it seems like the ""perfect storm"" didn't do that much damage to the company. While the decline after the earnings was around 13% that isn't uncommon especially for the small & medium cap growth companies.

Although the earnings missed (-US$0.48 vs. -US$0.06 expected) these results were heavily skewed by non-cash one-time expenses. These should not impact companys' fundamentals.

SoFi Lending and Financial Services Growth Source: Earnings Presentation

Yet the company got assigned „only“ a Neutral rating by Credit Suisse whose analyst Timothy Chiodo stated that he expects the lending operations to subsidize the expansion of Money and Invest products.

However if the acquisition of Golden Pacific Bancorp goes through in 2021 Sofi could receive full approval for the national bank charter which will be a positive news catalyst. A national bank charter will allow the company to boost its most valuable segment – lending platform.

Finally the last event to watch is the expiration of the U.S government student loan relief that expires in January 2022. Although the company could lose up to US$40m in refinancing due to relief this business segment should pick up through 2022.

Examining the Potential Value

We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion.

We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all cash it will generate in the future. However a DCF is just one valuation metric among many and it is not without flaws.

If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model.

The method

We will use a two-stage DCF model which as the name states considers two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period heading towards the terminal value captured in the second ""steady growth"" period.

To start with we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than in later years.

A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:

10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast

2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 Levered FCF ($ Millions) US$3.76b US$1.93b US$2.36b US$2.81b US$2.66b US$2.57b US$2.53b US$2.51b US$2.51b US$2.53b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x1 Analyst x1 Analyst x1 Analyst x1 Est @ -5.59% Est @ -3.31% Est @ -1.72% Est @ -0.61% Est @ 0.17% Est @ 0.72% Present Value ($ Millions) Discounted @ 7.5% US$3.5k US$1.7k US$1.9k US$2.1k US$1.9k US$1.7k US$1.5k US$1.4k US$1.3k US$1.2k

(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)

Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$18b

We now need to calculate the Terminal Value which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten-year period.

The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at the cost of equity of 7.5%.

Terminal Value (TV)= FCF 2031 × (1 + g) ÷ (r - g) = US$2.5b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.5%- 2.0%) = US$47b

Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$47b÷ ( 1 + 7.5%)10= US$23b

The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value which results in the Total Equity Value which in this case is US$41b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding.

Relative to the current share price of US$15.3 the company appears potentially underpriced at a discount of over 50%. This might sound concerning and we recommend potential investors to dig deeper.

What is going on here to cause the market to undervalue the stock so much? The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation so it is better to view this as a rough estimate not precise down to the last cent.

Important assumptions

Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows.

The DCF does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry or a company's future capital requirements so it does not give a full picture of its potential performance. Given that we are looking at SoFi Technologies as potential shareholders the cost of equity is used as the discount rate rather than the cost of capital (or the weighted average cost of capital WACC) which accounts for debt.

We've used 7.5% in this calculation which is based on a levered beta of 1.170. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0 a reasonable range for a stable business.

Looking Ahead:

Although the valuation of a company is important it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool.

Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price? Is the market overreacting to the one-time short-term setbacks and ignoring the positive developments down the road?

Here is a deep guide to aid a better understanding of the market-cap-weighted index of NASDAQ listed stocks.

Nasdaq an electronic stock exchange is one of the largest and top-rated stock exchanges in the world. The stock exchange is a host to large multi-million dollar companies from many parts of the world. It utilizes an electronic model for its operation which has aided a gross adoption of the stock exchange by large firms in many countries. The benefit of listing on a stock exchange that makes a company’s stock easily accessible to existing and potential investors from any part of the world has made the Nasdaq stock exchange a popular option for many companies. The composition of all companies listed on the Nasdaq stock exchanges is what is represented by the Nasdaq composite index. In other words the Nasdaq composite index is a stock market index that has a record of almost all companies listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange. It is also regarded as a market-cap-weighted index of all companies listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange.

Nasdaq’s prominence in the stock exchange market has a high impact on its index. Thus the Nasdaq composite index is one of the most popular and most followed stock market indexes in the world.

Investors always desire to be duly informed about a stock before making investment decisions. A stock market index is an efficient tool that helps investors in their decision-making process. As such the Nasdaq composite index performs like a tracker to all existing stocks on Nasdaq. It gives an insight of their market performance to provide investors with good information on the Nasdaq listed stocks before making investment decisions.

History of the Index

The Nasdaq composite index was invented by Nasdaq in 1971. The value of the index was 100 at the time it started. The index grew massively over the years and began to outperform other large indexes in the market. This saw more and more people following the index up thus causing a significant increase in the value of the index.

The index experienced a very notable spike in 1999 when the interest of investors was attracted to internet inclined companies. This led to major concentrations on the technology firms listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange. Hence the Nasdaq Composite started becoming a representation of the performance of the overall tech industry on Nasdaq.

As of 2007 and over ten years after the index was seen outperforming the S&P 500 consecutively with a cumulative return of about 608% during the period. The S&P 500 is another widely followed index in the market it had a cumulative return of 236% during the same period.

As of late 2021 the index has become a host to over 3000 securities.

Understanding the Nasdaq Composite Index

The methodology adopted by the Nasdaq composite index is quite easy to understand. As said earlier the index uses a market capitalization weighting methodology to track the value of the Nasdaq listed stocks.

The value of the Nasdaq composite index is calculated by multiplying the total value of the individual weights of each of the securities included on the Nasdaq stock exchange with the last price of each of the involved securities.

The result is further adjusted to a better reasonable figure to enable it to fit perfectly for reporting purposes. The adjustment is carried out by dividing the total value obtained from the first process by an index divisor.

The methodology adopted by the Nasdaq composite index ensures that the index is calculated continuously throughout the trading day meanwhile it is reported at intervals every second. The finally confirmed value is reported at the later hours of the trading days.

Criteria for Inclusion in the Nasdaq Composite

Just as there are procedures and requirements imposed on companies for listings on stock exchanges there are also criteria for inclusion in the Nasdaq composite.

Securities should be able to meet the criteria demands on the Nasdaq composite before inclusion in the index. They should possess either of the following qualifications:

Nasdaq Listed Companies. Companies readily listed on Nasdaq except for special cases of dual listing on other U.S markets prior to 2004.

American Depositary Receipts (ADRs). The index requires that the supposed included security should possess American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) before it can be considered for inclusion.

A common type of stock. This is a very crucial criterion for securities to be included in the Nasdaq composite index. They must fall under the category of common stocks.

Ordinary shares and shares of beneficial interest (SBIs). This implies that the company uses either an ordinary shares system or the shares of beneficial interests.

Firstly the concerned company is required to own Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) for inclusion in the index. Secondly limited partnership interests and tracking stocks should take place. Unlimited partnership interest could disqualify the intending company. The company is also required to keep its stocks trackable.

Nasdaq Composite Composition

The Nasdaq Composite Index is composed of long-established companies that got listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange since launch and the later-established companies that joined along the way.

There are also companies that switched to Nasdaq from other exchanges. The total composition of these companies includes 48.39% of companies from the technology industry 19.43% of companies with consumer services. Moreso 10.22% of companies from the health care sector are also included in the index with 7.21% financial companies. The industries consumer goods utilities telecommunications consumer goods utilities telecommunications oil and gas and basic materials are in the index at the rates of 6.85% 5.51% 0.81% 0.72% 0.55% and 0.32% respectively.

As of 2021 prominent companies like PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL) Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: NFLX) Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB) Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) and lots more form a majority of the large weighted companies that are included on the Nasdaq Composite index.

Nasdaq Composite vs. DJIA and S&P 500

Quite similar to the Nasdaq composite DJIA which is owned by the S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC is also a stock market index that keeps track of significant stocks that are traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).

Basically Dow JonesIndustrial Average measures the performance of some large blue-chip companies in the United States. It has been performing so well that it captures the attention of people who wish to get valid updates on the performance of the overall stock market. Although both stock indexes function for similar purposes there are some notable features that distinguish both indexes and make their functionalities quite different.

Unlike the Nasdaq composite that weighs stocks on the basis of their market capitalization DJIA measures stocks based on their prices. As such both index mechanisms for weighing stocks differ a great deal.

Besides DJIA is not limited to only one stock exchange like the Nasdaq composite but its functionalities are featured in the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and also extend to Nasdaq.

Quite interestingly the S&P 500 index which rivals the Nasdaq composite index is as well considered a rival to DJIA as it is outperforming DJIA in terms of its accommodation capacity and some other features.

In other words the S&P 500 hosts 500 large companies in the United States while DJIA only hosts about 30 blue-chip companies in the same nation. Thus they both accommodate companies only in the United States.

As said earlier S&P 500 is one of the most commonly followed and one of the largest stock market indexes in the world. It connects with more than one stock exchange unlike many other indexes it weighs stocks from the NASDAQ NYSE and Cboe BZX Exchange. Another distinguishing factor about S&P 500 is that it weighs stocks on a free-float and capitalization basis.

How to Invest in the Nasdaq Composite Index

Investing in Nasdaq composite index is easier than you could imagine. The index only requires potential investors to buy an index fund. This index fund could either be a mutual fund or ETF that keeps an exclusive track of the index. It is easier with Fidelity’s ETF.

Since an index fund allows investments in every security composed in an index with proportional weights as they are accorded in the index concerned Fidelity’s exchange-traded fund is a perfect instrument for investment as it tracks the broad-based Nasdaq Composite Index and can as well be utilized for exposure purposes on the Nasdaq Composite.

The public believes that index funds will deliver virtually identical performance with the index they track in due time.

Conclusion

Nasdaq solves issues of complexities. The methodology it adopts is pretty easy for investors to understand. It is a big aid to helping them make reasonable investment decisions.

More interestingly the investment process of the index is pretty easy as it only requires the purchase of index funds. All of these have been a major contributor to the swift growth in the activities and size of the exchange as it provides adequate customer services for companies and potential investors.

The exchange’s main focus on the technology industry has raised it over other exchanges considering the technology benefits and impacts it has on the market.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hc2RhcS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvNC1hdWdtZW50ZWQtcmVhbGl0eS1zdG9ja3MtdG8td2F0Y2gtYXMtZmFjZWJvb2stdW52ZWlscy1pdHMtZmlyc3Qtc21hcnQtZ2xhc3Nlcy0yMDIxLTA5LTEx0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,4 Augmented Reality Stocks To Watch As Facebook Unveils Its First Smart Glasses,"Check Out These Top Augmented Reality Stocks In September 2021

Snap Inc

Another top AR company to watch would be the trendy camera company Snap. By and large the company focuses most of its technology on camera-related services. Through its social media app Snapchat it empowers people to express themselves live in the moment and ultimately have fun together. So it would not be surprising that Snap’s products and services are popular among the younger generations.

Earlier in May Snap took a leap in the augmented reality space by introducing the next generation of Spectacles. This is the company’s first pair of display glasses designed for creators to overlay their Lenses directly onto the world. With dual 3D waveguide displays and a 26.3-degree diagonal field of view AR features can be experienced like never before. Most importantly it is relatively light at 134 grams so creators can bring it anywhere to bring out the world of augmented reality.

Furthermore the company also recently hired Konstantinos Papamiltiadis from Facebook to become Vice President of Platform Partnerships. He will be tasked to help recruit more AR creators and encourage companies to adopt Snap’s technology into their services. Considering all these would you be adding SNAP stock to your watchlist?

(NASDAQ: AZRX) (“AzurRx” or the “Company”) a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company specializing in the development in the development of targeted non-systemic therapies for gastrointestinal (GI) diseases announced today that it intends to effect a reverse stock split of its common stock at a ratio of 1 post-split share for every 10 pre-split shares. AzurRx’s common stock will continue to be traded on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol AZRX and will begin trading on a split-adjusted basis when the market opens on Monday September 13 2021 under a new CUSIP number 05502L204.

Supporting file access and storage functionalities already used by enterprise customers the service targets the migration to the cloud of applications and workloads that require high-performance ONTAP storage.

Similar to Amazon FSx for Lustre and Amazon FSx for Windows File Server the managed and highly reliable file systems introduced by AWS in 2018 the service covers enterprise deployments of NetApp's proprietary operating system and allows users to provision an ONTAP environment as an AWS managed service. Jeff Barr vice president and chief evangelist at AWS explains the use cases for ONTAP on AWS:

ONTAP is an enterprise data management offering designed to provide high-performance storage suitable for use with Oracle SAP VMware Microsoft SQL Server and so forth. ONTAP is flexible and scalable with support for multi-protocol access and file systems that can scale up to 176 PiB. (...) FSx for ONTAP is fully managed so you can start to enjoy all of these features in minutes.

Each file system is deployed in two availability zones with automatic replication of data and failover between the zones offering a 99.99% availability SLA. AmazonFSx for NetApp ONTAP supports features like inline data compression deduplication compaction thin provisioning replication (SnapMirror) and point-in-time cloning (FlexClone). It can be accessed by thousands of simultaneous clients running in EC2 Amazon ECS Amazon EKS and other AWS managed services.

The new service provides two storage tiers a more expensive allocated primary storage up to 192 TiB built on high-performance SSD and designed to hold data that is active or sensitive to latency and an elastic capacity pool storage that is cost-optimized designed to hold data that is accessed less frequently and that can scale to pebibytes.

Source: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-amazon-fsx-for-netapp-ontap/

As for S3 and EFS Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP includes an intelligent tiering functionality to manage the transition between the two storage classes according to usage. Each file system can scale up to hundreds of thousands of IOPS 2 GB/s of read throughput and 1 GB/s of write throughput. Sam Yates solution architect at AWS tweets:

This is going to be a huge win for some companies that need some of the capability NetApp ONTAP can bring to bear. Pretty excited to see it launch.

Jason Iehl director of solutions engineering at NetApp comments:

NetApp is thrilled about the new Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP file service which combines the agility of a native @AWScloud service with the rich data management capabilities of ONTAP software.

An introduction to the new service on Judsonian.com triggered a thread on Reddit about the benefits of the PaaS service. User GoneFishingFL questions the cost of putting all the storage in the cloud:

At $7325 a month for $100TB (backed up) that comes out to $263700 to $439500 (3-5 years) storage cost for that 100TB. That is assuming 80% of your data goes to lower tier storage AND 65% storage efficiency (...) That may not sound like a lot considering what that might cost you on premise but most on premise systems support at least 4PB a rack.

Corey Quinn in his newsletter adds:

I adore this so much. NetApp is the gold standard for NFS in production environments. If I can get this service offered in a more serverless way without a 1 TB minimum filesystem size (like EFS only with ONTAP's benefits) I would advocate using it for use cases both sensible and profane.

There are five components that determine the pricing of the service: the allocated SSD storage the number of SSD IOPS the capacity pool usage the provisioned throughput capacity and the storage for backups.

NetApp also offers solutions for Google Cloud and Azure.",,,,,,,,,

How to get set up with streaming,"Netflix has so many great TV shows and movies that seemingly every time you hear about a new thing to watch it's on Netflix. For that reason you might be wondering how to watch the streaming service on your TV. Relax it's easy. Here's what you need to know.

First the basics: You'll need the Netflix app and you'll find it either installed on your smart TV or on a device connected to your TV. The most common of these are specialized streaming devices -- like a Roku Amazon Fire TV or Apple TV -- or game consoles like a PlayStation or Xbox. Once you have the app and the device you'll then need a Netflix subscription and a stable internet connection.

Ready to get hooked up? Here's everything you need to know.

Getting started with Netflix on a TV

Netflix plans start at $9 a month a price that enables you to watch a single screen at a time (TV phone or whatever) with the downside being it offers relatively low video quality (standard definition or SD). For people who want to watch on a big screen it's worth moving up to Netflix's most popular plan ($14 a month) which enables you to stream in high definition or HD to two screens at once. If you have a 4K TV or want to watch on up to four screens at once you'll want the $18 subscription.

Next you'll also need some way to connect the internet directly to the device that will stream Netflix (more on that below). Depending on the device you may need a wired Ethernet connection or more commonly Wi-Fi. To connect that device to Wi-Fi you'll need to make sure you know your Wi-Fi name and password. Netflix recommends a minimum connection speed of 1.5Mbps and most broadband services can reliably achieve this but if you're unsure try visiting SpeedTest to measure your speed.

Netflix's recommended speeds Standard definition (SD) 3Mbps High definition (HD) 5Mbps 4K/Ultra HD (UHD) 25Mbps

Devices you can use to watch Netflix

Once you have an account and internet connectivity you'll need a device to watch Netflix on. Just like on your phone there's a Netflix app for TVs and other devices including media streamers and video game consoles. The app is free but of course you'll need to install it on the device first. Bear in mind that all of the options below presume either Netflix is on board your TV or you have a modern TV with an HDMI port.

If you have an older analog TV without HDMI sadly these options won't work for you. Roku used to make a streamer with analog out called the Roku Express Plus but has been replaced with a model with HDMI only. If you really don't want to buy a new TV just to get Netflix you may be able to find one of the former versions -- just look for the tell-tale AV-out port.

Smart TV: If you have a flat-screen TV manufactured in the last 10 years you can probably already watch Netflix on it. Modern TVs integrate streaming services like Netflix into an interface known as ""smart TV."" While some TVs have a dedicated Netflix button on the remote most compatible models have a smart TV button that should let you access the streaming apps available. The app may be older slower and not as slick as the modern version but if you want to access Netflix right now it should still work.

Streaming device or game console: While some TVs have Netflix apps built-in many people watch Netflix on TV using a separate device connected to their TVs. If you're not using the TV's built-in smart platform you'll want to be sure the TV has an HDMI port. Almost every device of the Netflix devices we'll mention below use HDMI connections.

Likewise your Blu-ray player or gaming console might have a Netflix app. If you have a relatively recent console -- from the Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3 and up -- you'll be able to access Netflix on it. For example the PlayStation 3 is still able to offer the most up-to-date version of the app which includes browser sign-in.

Mobile device: Phones and tablets can also control Netflix on a TV although the process can be a bit more complex than either of the two methods above. If you want to use your phone to control Netflix you can use a feature called Chromecast built-in or for Apple users AirPlay to stream video from your device. Recent TVs from Sony and Vizio enable users to navigate the Netflix app on their phone and then press the Cast button (below) to stream to the TV. Apple users can use the AirPlay icon (a TV with an arrow beneath it) in a similar way for Roku devices Apple TV and other recent televisions. You can then control the action with the phone or the TV remote. If your TV doesn't have Chromecast onboard for example you can add a Google Chromecast which plugs into a spare HDMI port.

The Cast button enables you to stream to a compatible TV. Ty Pendlebury/CNET

How to sign in to Netflix

Once you've got your device set up you'll open the Netflix app and be presented with a login screen. Recently Netflix added the option to sign on with a separate device even on older streamers like the PS3. No more typing long usernames and passwords with a remote just click on Sign on from Web at the bottom right of the screen. The device will give you a choice of a QR symbol or a code to type into an already-connected device (like your phone) here. However if your TV or streamer doesn't have this capability and you need to enter your Netflix login (username and password) manually first confirm the login details on a computer or phone first before trying it on your TV.

Need a streaming device? Start here

While your current smart TV game console or Blu-ray player with Netflix is the cheapest option it may not be the best one for you. If you have an older device for instance you may find its Netflix app to be sluggish or unreliable. You also miss out on interface improvements or new features such as the ability to watch interactive shows such as the Black Mirror special Bandersnatch or You vs. Wild (though it's not guaranteed). Or maybe you'd rather use a real remote instead of your console's controller.

The best way to access an up-to-date Netflix is via a new streaming device. Prices start at $30 with the Roku Express. Just plug one of these devices into a spare HDMI port on your current TV and follow the onscreen prompts. Many streamers include Netflix by default but each device (except Chromecast) also has a Streaming Channels list or App Store for downloading the app for free.

Amazon Fire TV Stick Lite Best budget streamer If you don't have a 4K TV and just want the cheapest option our pick is the basic Fire TV Stick. In addition to streaming Netflix and a bunch of other apps it has a remote with built-in voice search thanks to Alexa. Read our Amazon Fire TV Stick Lite review.

Sarah Tew/CNET Apple TV 4K (2021) Best for gamers and Apple fans The Apple TV 4K is the Rolls Royce of streaming devices with a luxurious feel and all the fixins. It supports Dolby Vision HDR for higher-quality visuals on certain Netflix shows. It also enables iPhone users to stream from the Netflix app using the AirPlay button. The device was updated earlier this year with a faster processor (which is great for playing games) and an upgraded remote. $180 at Amazon

One more option: Upgrade to a smart TV

If you're going to buy a new TV anyway chances are it will have an up-to-date smart TV system. Our favorite is Roku TV. It's easy to use and it offers the most comprehensive selection of streaming services out there.

Well you could argue the action itself is pretty OK and I’ll get to that but I still think it wouldn’t work half so well without Winstead anchoring the proceedings. The reason is two-fold: First Kate itself is a movie you’ve almost certainly seen before and I mean that literally. I considered turning this review into a Top Ten list of other movies that either inspired are directly referenced or just mysteriously happen to cover the exact same ground as Kate. The premise is tried and true in that it’s true that it’s been tried a bunch. And that’s fine! That’s something I could say about a lot of movies — including some of the very same movies Kate is pulling from! The point is that when you’re dealing with a Xerox of a Xerox anything that survives the transfer in sharp focus will naturally draw the eye. This brings me to the second reason: Mary Elizabeth Winstead DRAWS THE DAMN EYE. Saying she’s the best part of the movie isn’t saying much at all and saying that she elevates the movie implies that she lifts it up. No the movie is still what it is but what she accomplishes is potentially harder. She does exactly what the movie itself is doing — referencing a lot of different source material — only BETTER. She performs some kind of alchemy that makes Kate’s whole schtick seem somehow smarter than it is because while the movie is busily retreading tired ground she’s out here traipsing on wired ground.

Basically: Kate is watered-down Crank by way of Kill Bill Vol. 1 and Mary Elizabeth Winstead turns it into an excuse to play the spiritual successor to Ellen Ripley and Sarah Connor. Sure she and the movie both owe a debt to their cinematic antecedents but the difference is that Kate just made me want to watch the real deal (which isn’t hard — I ponder Crank: High Voltage at least once per day as is) while Winstead made me want to see HER given a shot at being the real deal. We don’t exactly have a lack of women in action roles but I can’t think of a single one who scratches that specific Sigourney Weaver itch. An itch I didn’t even realize I had until I saw this movie.

[Checks clock] Alright fine let’s talk about Kate then. The movie comes from director

Cedric Nicolas-Troyan whose previous credit was 2016’s desperation sequel The Huntsman: Winter’s War and the script was penned by Umair Aleem whose previous credit was Extraction (no not that one an even WORSE one starring Bruce Willis Kellan Lutz and Gina Carano if you can believe it). The plot follows an assassin named — yup you guessed it! — Kate (Winstead) who is suffering from an unwanted attack of conscience after she completed a job that involved killing a man in front of his teenage daughter Ani (Miku Martineau). That man was the brother of the head of a big yakuza clan. It’s a real chicken-egg situation: She’s either taking down yakuza because she’s in Japan or she’s in Japan because she needs to take down yakuza! We don’t get enough context to know which so let’s toss out the chicken and the egg and just assume it’s for ATMOSPHERE. Anyway Woody Harrelson plays Varrick Kate’s handler/father figure and when she confesses that she’s thinking about quitting the killing biz to try and live a normal life he gets her to hold out for one last job. THE last job. Killing the head of the clan. It’ll kinda put a bow on their whole Japan tour or something.

Anyway Kate meets Michiel Huisman at a bar and sleeps with him (duh) then gets her mission confirmation and heads out with her sniper rifle. Only she botches the job because she’s suddenly come down with a terminal case of radiation sickness … because Michiel Huisman poisoned her. I mean he spiked her drink or something he didn’t slip her a plutonium dick or anything (I think?). So she’s got a ticking clock of about a day to figure out who paid her one-night stand to kill her only she thinks she already knows. It’s the yakuza boss right? RIGHT? So obviously she needs to kidnap Ani to get his whereabouts then form an unwanted attachment with the plucky teen and then save the girl’s life while her uncle’s goons try to kill her too all while pushing down her own guilt over killing Ani’s dad in the first place. Kate plows through wave after wave of henchmen in her pursuit of… either finishing her job or getting revenge for her own protracted murder or both it’s a little muddled. And then backstabbing double-crossing and some easily anticipated reveals ensue.

A hitman who is poisoned and forced to continue pumping themselves full of adrenaline? That’s Crank. An assassin who kills a girl’s dad then ends up taking the girl under her wing? Netflix just did that with Gunpowder Milkshake. A white woman on a mission of revenge splattering blood across shoji doors? Heck Kate is even wearing a pair of Onitsuka Tiger sneakers the exact same style that Uma Thurman wore in Kill Bill but with a different color scheme (pretty sure nobody is allowed to wear the yellow ones again on screen though you can still buy them!). There’s a weird CGI car chase that gave me Speed Racer flashbacks — the movie yes but also the anime. Or any anime! At one point early on there’s a cartoon projected on the side of a high-rise (I am pretty sure it was Tokyo Ghoul) and from that point on it’s almost impossible not to see the anime influence on the staging of the action sequences from the off-kilter camera angles to the way the shot slows down as Kate falls or shoves a knife through someone’s skull. It’s stylized but still gritty shootouts mixed with bone-crunching fisticuffs and Kate staggers through it all on pure instinct even as her body fails her.

The fact that Kate makes it to the final showdown is hardly a surprise since as I said we’ve seen this all before. Yet there is real palpable tension in her journey purely because Winstead is able to project every ounce of pain and perseverance alongside the sort of fear and loneliness you don’t usually see from your action heroes. She isn’t shaking off the hits or the poison and her wounds don’t seem to just get lost after enough script pages or scene changes. If the movie bothered to invest in the story enough to provide some context for all this it might at least get a little closer to John Wick. As it is it makes me eager to see what the DCEU will do for Winstead’s Huntress after her scene-stealing debut in Birds of Prey but it also makes me curious what else Hollywood will throw at her. We have plenty of action movies from superheroes to heroes that may as well be super. What Sigourney Weaver and Linda Hamilton brought to Alien and The Terminator was something else — something we don’t have in abundance anymore. They made Ellen Ripley and Sarah Connor icons and in turn gave the films the oomph they needed to sustain whole franchises not by being indomitable but by being so very human. Theirs was an everyday strength harder than most but hardly mythic. It’s that quality that Mary Elizabeth Winstead brings to Kate and while the movie didn’t deserve it I hope somebody out there was paying attention because if she could do THAT in THIS crap? Just imagine what she could do with a script that’s worthy.

Kate is streaming on Netflix as of Sept. 10 2021.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L3R2LzIwMjEvMDkvMTIvbHVjaWZlci1zZXJpZXMtZmluYWxlLXJlY2FwLXBhcnRuZXJzLXRpbC10aGUtZW5kLW5ldGZsaXgvNTc3MzA3OTAwMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Lucifer' series finale recap: How the devil says goodbye on Netflix,"Spoiler alert! The following contains details from Season 6 of ""Lucifer"" including the series finale ""Partners 'Til the End.""

The devil is back in hell.

After six seasons one cancellation by Fox a rescue by Netflix and lots of romantic tension between Lucifer Morningstar (Tom Ellis) and Detective Chloe Decker (Lauren German) ""Lucifer"" said goodbye as the sixth and final season arrived on Netflix Friday.

What started as a fantastical police procedural based on characters from Neil Gaiman's ""Sandman"" comics evolved into a mythology-driven drama about heaven hell and the people muddling between on Earth. The final episodes still had a few mysteries for Lucifer and his detective to solve but mostly focused on the devil's fight to find his place in the world whether ascending to heaven to replace his father as God staying in his beloved Los Angeles or something else.

In 10 final episodes ""Lucifer"" tied up its dangling plot threads while introducing a few new wrinkles. The emotional action-packed finale was superb surprising and cathartic and might end up on the list of the best series endings of all time. Without veering too far into fan service it managed to stick the landing angel wings intact.

The majority of Season 6 deals with the appearance of Rory (Brianna Hildebrand ""Deadpool"") Lucifer and Chloe's daughter from the future. She traveled back to the present through angelic self-actualization because she was so very angry at her father for abandoning their family. This is news to both Lucifer and Chloe who can't imagine a reality in which Lucifer abandons his child after suffering from being cast out of heaven by his father for so many millennia.

In the penultimate episode Lucifer spends what he thinks might be his last day on Earth saying heartfelt goodbyes to his friends and soaking up every last moment with Chloe. When Lucifer survives past midnight the couple thinks they have thwarted the future until Lucifer receives a call from Le Mec (Rob Benedict) the mercenary who killed Dan (Kevin Alejandro). Escaped from prison and freed from his possession by Dan's ghost Le Mec has kidnapped Rory and brought her to the very intersection that Lucifer is supposed to disappear from in Rory's future.

Chloe and Lucifer head to the warehouse to get their daughter back fighting through Le Mec's minions. Lucifer eventually breaks through to find the mercenary with his gun to Rory's head. Le Mec felt Lucifer had tortured him and he wants to impart that same torture on the devil. Lucifer who always has a way with words explains that Le Mec should kill him instead. If he dies he won't get to see his daughter grow up which would be true torture.

Before Le Mec can kill Lucifer Rory breaks free and grabs him intent on killing the man who threatened her father. Caught in paralyzing rage Rory's face begins to take on the devilish features Lucifer once wore but Lucifer talks her down from her anger. Spared from Rory's wrath Le Mec tries one more time to kill Lucifer before Chloe comes in and shoots him.

It seems as if our dynamic trio has stopped the inevitable future but Rory is convinced that Lucifer is still going to leave. As they talk over events Rory helps Lucifer realize Dan stopped possessing Le Mec because his soul was finally able to conquer his guilt and move on to heaven all because of something Lucifer said to him. His real calling wasn't to be God but rather to help lost souls escape hell after they make amends and alleviate their guilt.

But in order for all of this to happen without messing with timelines Lucifer has to return to hell permanently and leave Chloe (now just barely pregnant with Rory) behind. Rory has to grow up without a father so that one day she'll travel back in time and help Lucifer realize how he can help the universe. As she's pulled back to the future she makes the devil – who never lies – promise he'll abandon her.

After a tender goodbye Lucifer leaves Chloe behind for hell. A poetic montage follows showing how Team Lucifer moves on after he goes back below. Amenadiel (D.B. Woodside) ends up as the new God intent on fixing more of Earth's problems than his father ever did. He still has time to be a father to his and Linda's (Rachael Harris) toddler son Charlie who finally sprouts wings. Chloe returns to the LAPD working with and promoting Sonia (Merrin Dungey) the Black officer trying to fix even a little bit of the systemic racism in the department. Ella (Aimee Garcia) and Carol (Scott Porter) are happy together running the foundation Lucifer left for her. Maze (Lesley-Ann Brandt) and Eve (Inbar Lavi) are married bounty hunting and deliriously happy. Dan is in heaven reunited with Charlotte (Tricia Helfer) his true love. Eventually Chloe brings baby Rory home to this found family.

In the future Rory returns to her old ailing mother on her deathbed. As Chloe dies she goes to heaven where Amenadiel finds her and asks if she wants to go home. We finally see what Lucifer has been up to all this time: In a room in hell that looks just like Linda's therapy office Lucifer is helping souls including Linda's ex-husband Reese (Patrick Fabian) and even Le Mec. A knock on the door reveals Chloe back in her young body ready to spend eternity with him. The pair lean into each other and the credits roll.

Emotionally satisfying unpredictable and well-earned it's a finale angels and demons can both be happy about.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmh5cGFibGUuY29tL2x1Y2lmZXItc2Vhc29uLTYtcmV2aWV3L9IBNGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmh5cGFibGUuY29tL2x1Y2lmZXItc2Vhc29uLTYtcmV2aWV3L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Lucifer’ season 6 review: Netflix lets the Devil say goodbye,"Our Lucifer season 6 review is a spoiler-filled discussion of the show’s final 10 episodes and everything this series has accomplished.

Wow we’re really here aren’t we? After Lucifer was cancelled—twice—I was terrified we wouldn’t get the ending we deserved. Thanks to Netflix however the show made it to season 6 and I couldn’t be happier.

After watching Lucifer season 5 I was excited about what came next even though I knew the show had a lot to fit into those final 10 episodes. So much had changed and yet there was so much more work yet to do.

Luckily the Lucifer writers’ room is full of professionals and they know what the fans want—and what we need. Lucifer’s final season was the perfect balance of looking at where we came from while simultaneously looking at where we were going with a few major curve balls thrown in along the way.

I couldn’t be more satisfied so without wasting another second let’s get into some of the major moments of Lucifer season 6 and why I loved them so much. (Remember spoilers ahead.)

‘Lucifer’ season 6 review

A walk down memory lane

One of the best things this season gave us was a walk down memory lane. I’m so grateful the cast and crew knew this was going to be the final season because it allowed the show to go back to its roots—in more ways than one.

The opening of the Lucifer season 6 premiere was an homage to the opening of the very first episode of the show and boy did it land! Seeing the cop again witnessing their conversation and know how far Lucifer has come in six seasons was incredible.

Article Continues Below

But it didn’t stop there. Throughout these last 10 episodes there were plenty of callbacks to the previous seasons. It didn’t feel like pandering either—it felt like a bunch of friends sitting around a room sharing inside jokes and stories from their past.

More than anything this last season was a comfort. It made me laugh and it made me cry. There were happy moments and silly moments and emotional moments. It was the epitome of what Lucifer has come to represent for me—a show full of characters choosing every day to be a better version of themselves.

Lucifer has driven me crazy over the years—as he’s meant to do—but at the end of the day you know he truly is trying to be worthy of the humans he’s surrounded himself with. Despite his narcissism and his near inability to take proper advice from his therapist he has found a way to organically grow as a person without changing the core parts of himself that has always made him great.

It might be silly as this show can be (purposefully) ridiculous sometimes but I’m not sure I’ve ever come across a series that has made me think as deeply about myself and the people around me as Lucifer has. Despite the situations being celestial in nature the lessons Lucifer learns are ones we should all keep in mind.

This show has always been about tackling your demons learning to communicate your feelings and taking responsibility for your actions. None of that has changed in the final season and I’ve found myself moved on more than one occasion because the series has tackled real-life issues we can call relate to.

Do the work

Speaking of tackling real-life issues Lucifer did not shy away from the more topical issues our society has been facing these days. I wanted to include this in my Lucifer season 6 review because I loved the way the show not only broached the topic but showed us that sometimes these solutions take time willingness and lots of work.

Episode 7 introduced Eve’s ex Adam who showed up the day before her wedding in an attempt to win her over. I loved how Eve stood tall the entire episode and didn’t back down from her convictions even once. This can be a difficult thing to do in the presence of a toxic ex who has taken advantage of your kindness in the past.

Better yet we actually get to see Adam work on his own issues of toxic masculinity thanks to Linda. It’s going to be a long and arduous journey for him but the fact that he can even be aware of his own shortcomings is progress. This arc was even more satisfying than if he’d just been written off as the guy who lost Eve because he didn’t treat her right.

Taking center stage however was Amenadiel’s journey to become a police officer in Caleb’s memory. Still aggrieved by the boy’s death I love that this angel wanted to spend time in the trenches righting as many wrongs as he could.

But it wasn’t going to be easy. The first strike against him came when he realized that the cop who’d threatened Caleb hadn’t been punished—he’d been promoted to Detective. Not only that but Amenadiel’s partner Officer Harris had a very different way of handling business than he did.

Harris used to be like Amenadiel—loud opinionated and righteous—but she learned the hard way that it wouldn’t get her anywhere. Instead she chose to take the small victories over chasing the big ones. She could’ve gotten a promotion but it would’ve sent her away from her neighborhood where the real work needed to be done.

I can’t say that Amenadiel and Harris ever truly saw eye-to-eye but together they were able to save a young woman’s life and reputation despite Detective Reiben’s interference. And I think they may have had an effect on each other—Amenadiel learned that doing the right thing isn’t always rewarded and Harris realized that sometimes you have to stick your neck out no matter the consequences.

Regardless Amenadiel certainly inspired Chloe who decided to rejoin the force and work from the inside out. As a white woman and a legacy cop she’ll (unfortunately) be taken a little more seriously than someone like Harris or Amenadiel. The show reminds us of the inherent privilege she has but then shows us that she’s willing to do the work.

The best part about this episode is that it confronts all of the complexities of this hot-button issue. Yes there are some bad cops out there. But there are good cops too. But what about the good cops who stay silent? Are they bad or are they doing the best they can with what they’re given?

The show doesn’t give us black-and-white answers to these questions but rather shows us that if we work together to hold people responsible good can come out of a bad situation. But it will still take time and effort.

By the Lucifer season 6 finale we see Chloe has made Lieutenant in under a year and has promoted Harris to a detective position. The department is far from fixed—let alone the issue of police brutality across the country—but Chloe stayed true to her word. It’s a start.

Sympathy for the Devil

It’s about time this Lucifer season 6 review tackled the main plot point of this season—the fact that Lucifer is about to become God. In the first couple of episodes he spends his remaining time with Chloe trying to figure out how to be the best God possible.

Of course this wouldn’t be Lucifer if the Devil didn’t put off the inevitable for a couple of days. It’s clear he doesn’t want to go to Heaven but that doesn’t exactly solve their problem of what to do now that his father—aka God—has left this realm to be with his wife.

Unfortunately the problems keep stacking up and in episode 3 we’re introduced to a new character (and get that amazing cartoon interlude). Rory flies Dan up to Earth in order to figure out how exactly to exact revenge on Lucifer. Why you may ask? Well turns out that Rory is Lucifer’s daughter from the future and she’s pissed that he abandoned her before she was even born.

Lucifer spends the rest of the season trying to prove he would never do that and doing his best to (once again) delay the inevitable. What I loved about this arc (other than Rory herself because she was a total badass) was the fact that we got to once again witness someone gaining sympathy for the Devil.

Yes Lucifer makes mistakes even when he’s trying to do the right thing. He can be dismissive forgetful self-centered and more than a little rude at times but he’s always trying and his awareness of his own shortcomings is coming more frequently every day.

Rory hated Lucifer more than anyone else in the world but even she got to witness how extraordinary he could be. And more than anything Lucifer’s saving grace was his love for Rory’s mother Chloe. Though this show has explored many topics of mortality and morality over the years it’s Lucifer’s love for Chloe that has become the foundation of everything he’s done.

I’m not usually a fan of plot lines that introduce surprise children but I have to say this one was played out to perfection. Not only did it help that Rory was full-grown and came in swinging with a personality that could go toe-to-toe with her father’s but I loved that it truly brought out the best in Lucifer.

Now not only did he have Chloe in his life but he had their daughter. His heart and his love expanded to include this other person that he admittedly barely knew but would do anything for. That is the definition of unconditional love and it was the final act in making Lucifer realize his true calling.

Goodbye Lucifer

Oh this part of the Lucifer season 6 review is going to be difficult. I cried my way through this season but nothing prepared me for the last two episodes. We truly got to see this show at its rawest and even though it brought me to tears I couldn’t have been happier.

First there were the goodbyes. Lucifer made it a point to talk to the important people in his life in case Rory was right about him leaving and never coming back. It was obviously difficult for him to come to terms with the fact that he’d abandon his daughter but I loved that he chose to be proactive in case it was true.

And in a way this allowed us to say goodbye to all these characters we’ve known for six years. It would’ve been harder to leave this show behind if it hadn’t taken the time to give each and every single one of them their moment to shine not only throughout the season but in the penultimate episode.

Amenadiel having become God found his true calling and he chose to wield this power differently than his father. He would stand by his brothers and sisters and work with them to make the world a better place—all while still making time to be with his son.

Linda who had been struggling with her self-confidence before this got to hear Lucifer say how much she meant to him not only as a therapist but also as a friend. As insane as her life has been over the years she has a chance to start over as a mother to a beautiful boy—who definitely has wings by the way.

Lucifer’s goodbye with Mazikeen was the most emotional for me because they have both come so far since the first season. Both of them have recognized their toxic habits and actively continue to work against them. In this moment Lucifer thanked Maze for being his best friend and wished that he had treated her better while Maze told him that her new life full of friends and family was all because of him.

He didn’t need to tell her that he was saying goodbye because these two understand each other on a level that perhaps no one else ever will. Her wordless emotional departure will bring tears to my eyes every time I think of it (including right now writing this Lucifer season 6 review) but I’m comforted by the fact that she will have Eve kicking ass by her side for the rest of time.

Dan’s sendoff was also emotional. After his conversation with Trixie he was able to ascend to heaven having finally confronted the last of his guilt. Dan’s death was hard to bear but I also think it was one of the strongest moments in the show because it was real and raw and had a lasting impact on everyone.

The way Lucifer season 6 subsequently handled Dan’s departure was even better. First he ended up in Hell where he had to work through his guilt. Then he became a ghost where he was able to say a proper goodbye to Chloe and Trixie before finally joining Charlotte in heaven. And yes seeing that pudding cup did make me burst into tears.

As wonderful as all of these goodbyes were my favorite was between Lucifer and Ella. Miss Lopez went through a bit of a journey this season and I’m glad she finally figured out what’s been going on all these years. Though it was difficult for her to understand how her friends would keep her out of the loop like this she came to accept that they had done it for her own safety.

Ella and Lucifer have always had a beautiful relationship. She’s been one of my favorite characters since the beginning for a variety of reasons. I love that her bright personality is an active choice she makes every day despite the darkness that lives inside inside her. Despite not being religious myself I respect the way her faith was called into question and her determination to reclaim it. I also love her eagerness to learn as well as her unabashed nerdiness.

Throughout the years Ella has been a comfort to all of her friends and I loved that during his goodbye Lucifer made sure to tell her how important she was to him. He also remembered his disappearing act from last time and made sure he didn’t hurt her like that again. In the end he gave her a gift that wasn’t shallow and flashy but something that would not only make her happy but also benefit others as well.

The final goodbye Lucifer had to make was between him and Chloe and the show spent the last episode letting these two fight side by side. After all it was called “Partners ‘Til the End” for a reason. The series once again proved that when these two are the same page they are invincible (more or less).

I’ll admit I was curious how Lucifer season 6 was going to satisfy us knowing that Lucifer would have to leave Chloe for several decades of her life and miss out on his daughter’s childhood. But damn they pulled it off.

In the end faith is what kept both of them going—faith in each other. It must’ve been difficult for Chloe to take care of Rory without Lucifer around but she did it to the best of her ability and raised a beautiful daughter in the process.

And imagine how many thousands of years Lucifer had to spend away from both of them in Hell. But he had found his calling acting as a therapist(!) to the souls who felt guilty over their actions in life. This is Lucifer at his best and when Chloe finally joined him as his partner I couldn’t believe our luck. They could be a family again.

Though it was touch-and-go there for a couple seasons as we wondered how Lucifer would end the show managed to give us exactly the kind of sendoff we—and these characters—deserved.

Thank you Lucifer for all the love and laughs you’ve provided us along the way.

How do you feel about our ‘Lucifer’ season 6 review?"

The media companies – formally Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd Nationwide News Pty Ltd and Australian News Channel Pty Ltd – were appealing a decision of the NSW Court of Appeal that they were liable for any defamatory imputation in readers’ comments posted on Facebook.

The legal proceedings were sparked by a defamation action brought by Dylan Voller in response to reader comments posted on news stories by Fairfax News Corp and Sky News. Voller is well known as the young Indigenous man at the centre of the notorious ""spit hood"" case in the Northern Territory juvenile detention system.

The abuse of Voller and other detained youth was exposed in July 2016 when the ABC’s Four Corners program aired whistleblower footage of Voller tied in a chair with a full canvas hood secured over his head.

The High Court case

The media companies sought to absolve themselves of responsibility for defamatory comments made about Voller by members of the public responding to their coverage of the spit hood story and subsequent reporting of Dylan Voller’s behaviour movements and opinion.

The High Court case was around two issues:

Does a publisher have to intend to communicate defamatory material? Is the creator of a social media page (such as Facebook) also the publisher of third-party comments posted without their knowledge or approval?

The act of publication is a central element in any defamation action as the publisher is deemed liable for defamatory material authored by another person.

In this case the publishers argued that they could not (and should not) be held responsible for content authored by members of the public and posted to the publisher’s Facebook channel in response to news stories. Fairfax and Nationwide News proffered the defence that they were merely ""innocent disseminators"" of the defamatory material that they didn’t know about beforehand therefore they could not be responsible for its publication.

The High Court rejected this argument and instead found that the media companies did hold liability for third-party commentary because they “facilitated and encouraged” third-party engagement with their content with an intent that it be published — which literally means made available for the public to see.

The brief outline of the High Court’s reasoning is summarised in its media statement:

The majority rejected the appellants' argument that for a person to be a publisher they must know of the relevant defamatory matter and intend to convey it. Each appellant by the creation of a public Facebook page and the posting of content on that page facilitated encouraged and thereby assisted the publication of comments from third-party Facebook users. The appellants were therefore publishers of the third-party comments.

What does the decision mean?

In their appeal to the High Court the publishers sought to shift responsibility from their shoulders onto Facebook and other social media platforms by claiming a defence of “innocent dissemination”. However the issue of intent in defamation is clear. The question in defamation proceedings is never about intent to defame — but rather intent to publish. The High Court found that the media companies had a clear intent to publish and that this is implicit in their public-facing social media pages.

The High Court has affirmed the long-held principle that the publisher is liable for defamatory imputations because of the act of publication and that this applies whether there was an intent for the material to be defamatory or not.

At the heart of this case is a simple economic question: Who should bear the cost of moderating comments on public Facebook pages?

This is a good question but it’s not new. The issue has come up repeatedly in relation to “fake news” particularly in light of what happened during the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election season. Physical moderation of comments on social media is a huge task that requires thousands of hours of human labour and it can’t always be left to algorithms that are still clumsy sledgehammer-type tools.

The news companies do employ administrators who are supposed to moderate comments; the problem is that comments will often be technically published before an administrator can effectively moderate them. It’s a catch-22 for news companies who crave engagement and need high numbers to secure advertising. At the same time they are reluctant to cover the cost of having full-time and thorough comment moderation.

The news companies were surely aware of their liability in terms of the 'Defamation Act 2005' but tried to get out of it using a rather weak argument akin to what I call the “Bart Simpson defence” of “I didn’t do it”.

This is how the case was summarised by the High Court justices:

The defendants submitted that they did not make the defamatory posts available to the public nor did they participate in the publication of the defamatory posts nor were they in any relevant sense 'instrumental' in the publication of the defamatory posts. Rather they administered a public Facebook page on which third parties published material... they submitted that they were more closely equivalent to the supplier of paper to a newspaper owner or the supplier of a computer to an author.

In their decision the justices determined that the news companies had 'encouraged and facilitated' public comments and were therefore 'participants in the publication of postings by the forum’s users and in that sense they were publishers from the outset...'

The Court held that the news companies could not hide behind a claim to be passive victims of Facebook’s operating systems and should bear the consequences of publishers in regard to defamatory comments on their public pages.

In my view there is nothing contentious or novel in this decision; it is merely affirming the long-standing convention in relation to defamation law. However there is a very “Chicken Little” view in some of the commentary.

For example The Sydney Morning Herald's Michaela Whitbourn suggests that the High Court ruling has 'implications for all social media users'. This claim is backed up in the story with a quote from a legal scholar who affirms that ""ordinary users” of social media platforms can be held liable as publishers for comments posted on their pages.

Well colour me unsurprised.

Anybody who has even an inkling of what defamation law is all about would have been aware of this. Nothing has changed by the High Court decision. The Court has confirmed what most defamation lawyers and savvy journalists should already know — publish and face the consequences.

Let’s not forget that Pork Barillaro’s action against Friendlyjordies or Peter Dutton’s case against refugee activist Shane Bazzi were already possible because… guess what… If you post material on social media and other people can see it you are technically and literally a publisher as far as defamation law goes.

I agree with the comments made by Dylan Voller’s legal team:

'This is a commonsense decision that accords with longstanding law on the issue of publication… media companies encourage increased engagement…This helps in attracting advertising revenue. With this strong commercial imperative driving them there was no doubt that the media companies lent their assistance to the publication of third-party comments.'

It’s no surprise that big media apologists are describing the High Court decision as 'a devasting defeat for the industry'. Let me translate this for you: “Oh sh*t this is another blow to our already precarious bottom line. Shareholders will not be happy.”

Defamation law academic Michael Douglas sums it up very well:

The media could pay someone to sit on socials and remove dodgy content as it appears. Media companies point out that this option is virtually impossible given the mountain of public comments they need to deal with. Hiring a moderator also costs money. In an industry fighting to stay profitable this is a big deal.

The question going forward is what will publishers need to do so that they are protected in future? The cheapest option is to turn off comments.

As the Independent Australia team already knows moderation must be proactive and timely. Short of turning off comments entirely it is almost impossible to avoid liability if somebody is determined to use a platform to defame someone else.

There’s also very little defence against stupid. People may comment in a way that is defamatory without any intent but as the High Court has confirmed that is irrelevant.

The best advice is to be conscious that defamation is easy to do and much harder to undo.

Photo by: 2018 Nick Cammett/Diamond Images/Getty Images)

Jordan Mailata has officially signed the richest contract ever earned by an Australian in the NFL.

The 24-year-old former South Sydney Rabbitohs talent had been in a fight for the starting offensive tackle position at the Philadelphia Eagles — a battle that had a fortune riding on it.

Mailata won the battle and has also won a whopping four-year contract that could be worth up to $108 million ($USD80m) — if he meets performance bonus clauses.

As first reported by ESPN the deal is worth USD$64 million with $40.85 million guaranteed.

It puts him near the top of the highest-earning Australian athletes right now.

“Excited to be here for another four years representing this team and city” Mailata said in a Twitter video posted by the Eagles.

“I can’t wait to keep representing my family and everything that I have in me. Give it to you guys to get this championship here. Remember Go Birds baby!”

Mailata had been in the final year of the $US2.5 million deal he signed when drafted by the Eagles in the 7th round of the 2018 NFL Draft and was a free agent heading into the 2022-23 season.

Former NFL star Colin Scotts had told The Daily Telegraph in August Mailata could earn up to $20 million per season if he was able to convince the Eagles he was ready for the starting position.

He could end up earning $27 million per-season.

According to stats company PFF — which supplies data for NFL broadcasters and ESPN — Mailata is now the 12th highest-paid offensive tackle in the league.

“Philadelphia are ready for him to stand up and be their left tackle which would be a major accomplishment” he said.

“Offensive tackles are signing up for $20m (a year). The money is off the charts.”

Mailata’s career took a huge step forward after he was declared the number one protector for Philadelphia quarterback Jalen Hurts. Last month Eagles head coach Nick Sirianni revealed the Australian would be the starting left tackle this season beating out former first-round pick Andrew Dillard for the role.

Mailata has spent four years with the Eagles honing his craft before eventually making his NFL debut off the bench last season. But the 24-year-old had to transform his monstrous 203cm frame to break into the side.

“When I first came here I was still pretty small. I was 148kg 150kg. They’re used to seeing players in the O-line with guts” Mailata told The Sydney Morning Herald.

“I’ll be honest I don’t know what I am in kilograms but I think I’m 155 to 160kg.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFiYy5uZXQuYXUvbmV3cy8yMDIxLTA5LTEyL2ZhY2Vib29rLWRlZmFtYXRpb24taGlnaC1jb3VydC1ydWxpbmctZXhwb3Nlcy1tb3JlLXRoYW4tbWVkaWEvMTAwNDUxMTk40gEoaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuYWJjLm5ldC5hdS9hcnRpY2xlLzEwMDQ1MTE5OA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Facebook defamation ruling by High Court exposes all page owners to lawsuits not just the media,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-09-12/facebook-defamation-high-court-ruling-exposes-more-than-media/100451198 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFiYy5uZXQuYXUvbmV3cy8yMDIxLTA5LTEyL2ZhY2Vib29rLWRlZmFtYXRpb24taGlnaC1jb3VydC1ydWxpbmctZXhwb3Nlcy1tb3JlLXRoYW4tbWVkaWEvMTAwNDUxMTk40gEoaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuYWJjLm5ldC5hdS9hcnRpY2xlLzEwMDQ1MTE5OA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlYWxlc3RhdGUuY29tLmF1L25ld3MvZm9ybWVyLXRlc3QtY3JpY2tldGVyLW1pY2hhZWwtY2xhcmtlLWJ1eXMtMTNtLXZhdWNsdXNlLWhvbWUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Former Test cricketer Michael Clarke buys $13m Vaucluse home - realestate.com.au,"Former Test cricketer Michael Clarke has a new bachelor pad snapping up a “European-inspired” five-bedroom home in Vaucluse for about $13m prior to auction.

Media giants NineFax and News Corp have lost their High Court case seeking a ""get-out-of-gaol-free"" card in relation to defamatory material published on their social media pages. Dr Martin Hirst says there’s no surprise in the decision.

As part of its Sex Records New York pop-up the venerable American luxury label is applying its inimitable taste for cheeky opulence to all kinda one-off collectibles including toy cars toilet paper and some recognizable sneakers.

Yup those are Chrome Hearts-customized Nike Dunks on display in the pop-up taking up an entire wall inside the new annex space which is adjacent to Chrome Hearts' West Village flagship.

There you'll see all manner of high and low-top Dunks laden with one-of-one artwork painted by hand onto each sneaker. There's thematic ""SEX"" branding checkerboard patterns swirly ghost things and more.

Of course because this is a Chrome Hearts joint all of the Dunks' metal bits have been swapped for solid silver and gold from the aglets to the dubraes to the pulls that gather the laces.

This is nothing new for Dunk customization of course as sneaker obsessives have been remixing shoes for years. They've painted on 'em swapped soles and even made their own versions of Nike's signature silhouettes.

As such not everyone's finding Chrome Hearts' work terribly novel. ""Ive seen customs way better"" said one commenter on HighsnobietySneakers' Instagram post. Others concurred uttering ""So weak"" or ""This is so lame.""

Given how litigious Nike has been over lookalikes and customizations it seems risky for a company as big as Chrome Hearts is dipping its silver-coated toe into the realm of bespoke Dunk resale.

Then again Chrome Hearts is only offering the kicks in-store and by appointment for three days so if Nike wants to put a stop to the endeavor it'd better move fast.

Chrome Hearts' leather-patched jeans repurposed from vintage pairs of Levi's never sparked any ire so perhaps it's okay when Chrome Hearts does it.

It does flip the revamped Levi's for nearly $2000 apiece (these Dunks are rumored to retail for upwards of $3000) so there's no chance that it'll cut into Nike's profit margin at least. No competition no lawsuit perhaps.

Chrome Hearts has explored sneaker customization plenty of times already. Famously it once remixed Rick Owens' Geobasket sneaker — which received its own Nike C&D — with silver appliqué and hardware paving the road for this very pricey Dunk experiment.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNob290b25saW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzL25pa2VzLXlvdS1jYW50LXN0b3AtdXMlQzIlQTB3aW5zLXByaW1ldGltZS1jb21tZXJjaWFsLWVtbXnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"Nike's ""You Can't Stop Us"" Wins Primetime Commercial Emmy","Nike’s “You Can’t Stop Us”--directed by Oscar Hudson of Pulse Films for Wieden+Kennedy--won the primetime commercial Emmy on Sunday (9/12) during the third of three Creative Arts Emmy Awards ceremonies held this weekend at LA Live in downtown Los Angeles.

The spot shows how--in the face of unprecedented challenges including a pandemic--the power of sport still inspires. We have not stopped needing sport and it continues to be a source of inspiration showing the world what’s possible when we come together.

Narrated by Megan Rapinoe U.S. soccer star two-time World Cup Champion and equality activist the film shares a dynamic split screen series detailing 36 pairings of athletes and relating the kinetic movement of one sport to another. The collective of everyday and elite athletes includes Rapinoe Serena Williams LeBron James Colin Kaepernick Naomi Osaka Simone Biles Eliud Kipchoge Cristiano Ronaldo and Kylian Mbappé Developed through research of over 4000 individual pieces of footage the resulting montage underscores commonalities shared by athletes around the world highlighting connections and unity we may not always see and shows the platform that sport provides for athletes from all levels and all walks of life to raise their voice advocate for change and stand up for our communities.

“You Can’t Stop Us” topped a field of nominated commercials this year which also consisted of: Apple AirPods’ “Jump” directed by Sam Brown of Imperial Woodpecker for TBWA\Media Arts Lab; Apple Watch Series 6’s “It Already Does That” helmed by Craig Gillespie of MJZ; “Alexa’s Body” for Amazon Alexa directed by Wayne McClammy of Hungry Man for Lucky Generals; “Better | Mamba Forever” a Nike tribute to the late great Kobe Bryant directed by Melina Matsoukas of PRETTYBIRD for Wieden+Kennedy; and Beats by Dr. Dre’s “You Love Me” also directed by Matsoukas for agency Translation LLC.

The win for “You Can’t Stop Us” continues an Emmy tradition for Nike and Wieden+Kennedy. Nike’s “The Morning After”--directed by Spike Jonze of MJZ for Wieden+Kennedy--won the primetime spot Emmy in 2000. And Nike’s “Dream Crazy”--directed by Lance Acord Emmanuel “Chivo” Lubezki and Christian Weber of Park Pictures for Wieden+Kennedy--earned the Emmy in 2019.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vZmFkZWF3YXl3b3JsZC5uZXQvbmJhLW1lZGlhL3NoYXF1aWxsZS1vbmVhbC1yZXZlYWxzLWhvdy1oZS1ibGV3LWhpcy1tZWV0aW5nLXdpdGgtbmlrZS10by1zaWduLXdpdGgtcmVlYm9r0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Shaquille O'Neal Reveals How He Sabotaged His Own Meeting With Nike To Sign With Reebok Instead,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://fadeawayworld.net/nba-media/shaquille-oneal-reveals-how-he-blew-his-meeting-with-nike-to-sign-with-reebok on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vZmFkZWF3YXl3b3JsZC5uZXQvbmJhLW1lZGlhL3NoYXF1aWxsZS1vbmVhbC1yZXZlYWxzLWhvdy1oZS1ibGV3LWhpcy1tZWV0aW5nLXdpdGgtbmlrZS10by1zaWduLXdpdGgtcmVlYm9r0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vc25lYWtlcmJhcmRldHJvaXQuY29tL25pa2Utd2FmZmxlLW9uZS1icmVkLWRkODAxNC0wMDEtcmVsZWFzZS1kYXRlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nike Waffle One Bred DD8014-001 Release Date,"The Nike Waffle One continues to expand its lineup and the next colorway to surfaces is this “Bred” color option.

What's next for Chesapeake man who designed them?,"Kenny Jones was driving back from New York when his stepmother called saying a package arrived with his name on it. It was his birthday. His wife looked at him and said his shoes came in the mail.

Jones designed a Virginia Beach-inspired Nike SB Dunk which won an Instagram contest in March. The sneaker he originally drew on an 8.5-by-11-inch piece of paper went through a five-month development process and showed up on his doorstep Aug. 28.

He never thought he would have the chance to design his own custom shoe until he came across the contest hosted by two Instagram accounts Reverse Land and Nike SB or Nothing. His shoe sold out in less than 15 minutes on Saturday to a “very limited amount” of people according to Ian Huang who oversaw the shoe’s development.

People who pre-ordered the Dunks can expect their pair to be shipped in the next two to five months Huang said in an email.

When he announced that the shoe would cost around $900 Jones said he was worried about whether people would buy it. The Virginia Beach native who lives in Chesapeake knew how expensive custom sneakers typically run and he prepared himself for negative comments.

Some people who initially supported his design suddenly downplayed and made fun of the sneaker on social media. Backlash directed toward Jones insinuated that he had a say in the price which he said he didn’t.

“Our team doesn’t get paid working on this project” Huang said. “On top of that we’ll be losing money working on sizes US 11.5 and above due to the cost of (the) base shoe.”

Huang’s team had to find and order authentic Nike SB Dunks detach the sole reconstruct the sneaker’s upper body and customize its insoles. On average depending on the price of the base shoe it cost about $750 to customize each pair.

U.S. Coast Guardsman Kenny Jones designed a Virginia Beach-themed Nike SB Dunk sneaker and won an Instagram contest to produce the shoe. Pre-orders for the shoe started online Saturday September 4 2021 at reverselandconcrete.com. Nike did not take part in the shoe’s development nor is the brand affiliated with the sneaker.

In a perfect world Jones said he would’ve liked to partner with Nike to manufacture a sneaker at a more affordable price. But he’s thankful for the opportunity to design a sneaker no matter how he came across it.

Any doubts the 29-year-old had dissolved when Pusha T a musician and Virginia Beach native commented on Jones’ Instagram post saying he wanted to buy two pairs. It was a full-circle moment since the design was inspired by local “music legends” including Pharrell Timbaland and Missy Elliot.

Victor Cruz Jones’ favorite football player also ordered a pair for himself. The former NFL wide receiver was a celebrity judge during the contest’s third round — he voted for Jones’ shoe out of the final five designs.

“I’m just a guy in the Coast Guard who always dreamed to have my own shoe” Jones said.

Jones said he feels like he’s still dreaming when he sees his nickname on the Dunks’ tongue. Sometimes when his wife Adriana and 4-year-old son go upstairs before the night is over Jones will sit at their kitchen table and stare at the embroidered waves in awe.

He has yet to wear his sneaker out in public because the blue colorway is bound to catch someone’s attention. Jones said he’ll probably break them in during a subtle date night with his wife where they’ll catch the least amount of eyes.

So where will Jones go from here?

Jones said he began designing fitted hats and graphic T-shirts to keep his options open outside of sneakers. He’s working on the logistics to avoid any potential legal issues when it comes to designs and fashion but he hopes it’s something he can pursue full-time in the future.

Kansas City Southern has decided that a $31 billion bid from Canadian Pacific is the best of two offers on the table to buy the railroad.

The Kansas City Missouri company said in a statement Sunday that it has notified rival bidder Canadian National that it intends to terminate a merger agreement and make a deal with Canadian Pacific.

But it's not final yet. Canadian National still has five business days to negotiate amendments to its offer and the Kansas City Southern board could determine that a revised CN offer is better.

In its own statement Canadian National said it's evaluating its options. ""CN will make carefully considered decisions in the interests of all CN shareholders and stakeholders and in line with our strategic priorities"" the railroad said.

Under the Canadian Pacific offer each share of Kansas City Southern common stock would be exchanged for 2.884 CP shares and $90 in cash.

""We are pleased to reach this important milestone and again pursue this once-in-a-lifetime partnership"" said Canadian Pacific President and CEO Keith Creel.

Canadian National's bid was $33.6 billion but regulators rejected a key part of the offer last month.

The Surface Transportation Board said Canadian National won't be able to use a voting trust to acquire Kansas City Southern and then hold the railroad during the board's lengthy review of the overall deal.

In contrast regulators have already approved Canadian Pacific's use of a voting trust because there are fewer competitive concerns about combining Canadian Pacific and Kansas City Southern.

Canadian Pacific set a deadline of Sunday for its offer. Both Canadian bids include a mix of cash and stock and the assumption of about $3.8 billion in Kansas City Southern debt.

It's not yet clear whether Canadian National has any appetite to increase its bid because it is facing pressure from a major shareholder to abandon the deal. London-based investment firm TCI Fund — which owns about 5% of CN's stock — maintains that CN should overhaul its board get a new CEO and refocus its efforts on improving its own operations.

For more than two decades the railroad industry has been stable with two railroads in the Western United States — BNSF and Union Pacific — two in the Eastern United States — CSX and Norfolk Southern — Kansas City Southern in the Midwest and the two Canadian railroads that serve part of the United States. Regulators have said that any merger involving two of the largest railroads generally needs to enhance competition and service the public interest to get approved.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3gxM21lbXBoaXMuY29tL25ld3MvdHJlbmRpbmcvYXVzdHJhbGlhbi1tYW4tc2V0cy13b3JsZC1tYXJrLWhvbGRzLWFiZG9taW5hbC1wbGFuay1mb3ItOS01LWhvdXJzL2FydGljbGVfZjFlMTBkOGItNzY4Ny01ZTQwLWE2ODYtZmVjMTM0OTM2ODdiLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Australian man sets world mark holds abdominal plank for 9.5 hours,"Memphis TN (38111)

She learned a lesson that still guides her.,"Ten days after 9/11 Americans were still reeling from the terrorist attacks that killed nearly 3000 people a sense of grief and shock lingering like the dust clouds hovering over the collapsed Twin Towers.

A little girl who lived on Arbor Road in Winston-Salem was too young to comprehend the enormity of the loss but she could feel that people were hurting.

“What can I offer for people?” she asked herself.

Nine-year old Collier Wimmer slipped into a green dress trimmed with embroidery pulled her hair back into a ponytail and with her arms stiffly to her side began to dance in front of a handmade sign that read: “Irish danceing for American relief funds.”

Ted Richardson then a photographer for the Winston-Salem Journal was on his way to another assignment when his eye caught Wimmer intently dancing in front of her parents’ home.

“As a photographer I was definitely going to stop” Richardson recalled. “I liked the misspelling on the poster and I liked her focus. She had the clarity to do something simple a little childlike innocence but a clarity.”

The photo ran inside the Journal two days later but didn’t catch on until the Associated Press distributed it around the world.

The photo of Wimmer ran in a special edition of Newsweek a journalism institution at the time with a circulation of more than 4 million and on MSNBC’s website. Oprah Winfrey’s crew sent a card.

“I think people grabbed on to it” Wimmer’s mom Ashley Wimmer said.

Donations and cards from around the country poured in. And for a little while the heart and resolve of this wee Irish dancer parted the country’s veil of sadness at a time when people hungered for something to make them smile.

“I remember getting donations and heartfelt letters from Washington state and I had to find Washington state on the map” said Collier who was then a third-grader at Summit School. “I didn’t understand the significance that I and that little Irish-dancing dress had on the community.”

The money she raised about $1000 went to a fund for New York firefighters.

The Irish loved it of course. Irish America Magazine named her one of the Top 100 Irish Americans of the year which led to an invitation to dance in front of the president of Ireland at a gala in New York City.

At the gala she met several Irish-American firefighters who had been on the scene of the 9/11 attack at the World Trade Center.

“I was blown away that they were thankful for me and I was like ‘Why are you thanking me?’ I get emotional thinking about it now” Wimmer said.

Richardson now a freelance photographer based in Mebane said the photo of Wimmer ranks as one of his favorite and best-known in his 25-year career.

“It was a bright spot. There were no politics. No orchestration. She didn’t expect to be photographed” he said.

Wimmer now 29 is a global communications specialist at Delloite and choreographs dressage freestyle a type of synchronized dancing between rider and horse.

Her small act of kindness in the aftermath of one of the country’s darkest periods taught Wimmer a lesson that continues to guide her.

“It becomes ‘What can I do?’ Whether you’re helping one person or a thousand. How can I continue to be something positive?” said Wimmer who relocated to Winston-Salem during the pandemic. “I mean look at that picture. It rippled across the country.”

As for Irish dancing?

“Occasionally I’ll do it. I usually bring it out for St. Patrick’s Day” she said. “I’ll always have a soft spot in my heart for Irish dancing.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3gxM21lbXBoaXMuY29tL25ld3MvdHJlbmRpbmcvcG9saWNlLWFjYWRlbXktYWN0b3ItYXJ0LW1ldHJhbm8tZGVhZC1hdC04NC9hcnRpY2xlXzFhODA2MTk2LTAyYWMtNTM0YS05ZDMwLWNkMWI5ZGQ1MDczOC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Police Academy' actor Art Metrano dead at 84 | Trending | fox13memphis.com,"Memphis TN (38111)

Photo / Michael Cunningham

Draped in a superman costume a Pompallier Catholic College student has won a grand prize of many laughs and $3000 in a road safety short film competition.

Northland Road Safety Trust (NRST) in partnership with Students Against Dangerous Driving (SADD) introduced the ""Drive in the Moment"" road safety initiative to secondary schools in Whangārei and Kaipara. It has been designed to help drivers reduce their smartphone use behind the wheel.

The purpose of the

competition is to encourage young drivers to engage with the website/toolkit develop a plan that will work for them and put away the phone while driving.

The total prize pool was set at $5000 where the first place received $3000 the second $1500 and the third $500.

Whangārei Rotary Club had put up their hand to sponsor first place while Northland Road Safety Trust funded the rest.

Pompallier Catholic College Year 13 student D'Artagnan Gould 17 submitted a four-minute video titled ""Superhero"" which was selected the best by a panel of three judges.

In the video Gould could be seen wearing a Superman costume who thought he was invincible but faced a tragic end. Filled with comic timings wit and a strong message the video was made with the help of his mates Blair Oxenham and Sean Clarke.

Gould said the goal was to give the video a homemade VHS kind of feel so he felt the better option was to improvise on set rather than relying heavily on a script.

""We weren't short on time filming the video so we preferred to spend extra time trying different ideas and seeing what worked and what didn't. This meant a lot of footage was cut out during editing.""

American superhero film Shazam! was the inspiration behind this video said Gould.

The young director said working on the project helped him to become more aware of the dangers of distracted driving.

In the last couple of years Gould had worked with others to write direct and edit weekly episodes of Marist Marvels and Friends and showed them at every school assembly for Pompallier.

""They are a series of episodes designed to share good messages. The videos are all heavily reliant on a script due to the short turnaround timeframes.

""Since this project was mostly improvised it brought a completely different style of filmmaking to the table.

""In the editing process rather than relying on a script to guide me through the edit I just had to work with what I had and let the footage lead me.

""This kind of skill has actually helped during this lockdown as I organised a video with the other head students of Whangārei where we'd share messages to students in lockdown. This wasn't done using a script which meant that I had to use the skills gained from the film competition to put together the footage and make it work.""

The Coalition of Northern Groups CNG on Friday in collaboration with the Ulama Council of Kano organised a prayer session for God to bring an end to the current security situation in the North and Nigeria.

This was disclosed by the CNG’s spokesperson Abdul-Azeez Suleiman in a statement issued in Abuja.

Suleiman said the special prayers which are to be conducted in all states of northern Nigeria would also seek divine help for the success of the troops currently engaging the bandits in the North West insurgents in the North East and other criminal gangs elsewhere in the country.

Suleiman said the takeoff phase of the session was conducted at the Allasan Dantata Mosque at Koki Kano State on Friday.

The prayer session was led by Imam Gwani Alyu Saleh who is the chairman of Qur’anic Reciters of Nigeria and coordinated by CNG’s national leader Balarabe Rufai.

Suleiman said “The session which was attended by dozens of renowned Ulama and Quran memorizers and top reciters prayed God to grant victory to the Nigerian troops currently battling to bring peace to the land.

“Prayers were also offered for the safety of innocent Nigerians currently in captivity as well as total disarmament disengagement demobilization reconciliation and resettlement across the North and Nigeria in general.

“The sessions are expected to be a continuous process every Friday in all northern states until a final declaration of victory is achieved” Suleiman said in a statement issued in Abuja.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZW5vcnRoZXJuZWNoby5jby51ay9uZXdzLzE5NTcxODU0LmRhZnQtZm9vdGJhbGxlcnMtZ29pbmctZ2xvYmFsL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Daft footballers are going global,"She is Dr Anne Allen who grew up in Bishop Auckland and attended the King James School in the 1980s.

Ordering 35-year-old mother-of-two Cherith Douglas to spend a further seven months on licence Judge Patrick Lynch QC told the disgraced former nurse her reputation and career “are in tatters.”

“At a time when the health service has been rightly praised it’s a great pity that a person such as yourself an experienced and trained clinician should find yourself before me” said the Craigavon Crown Court judge “a reputation in tatters a career in tatters.”

At an earlier hearing Douglas from Weavers Lodge in Hamiltonsbawn entered guilty pleas to a total of 12 offences spread across two indictments – eight of fraud by false representation and four of false accounting all committed on various dates between 11 April 2015 and 5 May 2017.

Opening the facts of the case on Friday prosecuting counsel Nicola Auret told the court the offences related to when Douglas was a senior band seven nurse at Craigavon Area Hospital and then as nursing manager at a nursing home in Lisburn.

Taking them in chronological order the lawyer said that junior nurses used the health trusts “whistleblowing service” to raise their suspicions about Douglas’ working practices

Further investigations revealed that in essence Douglas was claiming for either duplicate shifts and for hours she had not worked beginning shifts late or leaving early using her position as a senior nurse to facilitate the frauds.

At the beginning of Douglas’ offending paper forms were filled in and signed off but in her case forms were “not signed off in the proper manner” said Ms Auret.

When the system was computerised it transpired that Douglas had helped a colleague set up her sign in details but then used those details herself to create fake time sheets while colleague reported that Douglas had asked her for her log in details.

“She felt compelled to do so because Douglas was her superviser” said Ms Auret adding that of all the shifts she was supposed to work and for which she had been paid Douglas had completed “half to two thirds of her shifts” with excuses “ranging from child care problems to having a personal trainer in the morning.”

Human Resources estimate that Douglas swindled just over £11000 from the trust and while Douglas was initially suspended in May 2017 within days of her suspension the fraudster resigned her position.

Within a short period however Douglas took up a position as a care home manager on a £41000 annual salary having supplied a reference which spoke of her in “glowing terms.”

There was also no mention or reference that Douglas was facing an internal trust investigation but her falsely based house of cars came tumbling down in August 2017 when the trust circulated an email to health care providers which identified Douglas as being investigated.

That led to her new employers discovering that the Simon Trouton who wrote Douglas’ glowing reference did not even exist and the fraudster was summarily dismissed from her post.

Ms Auret said while the fraud of the trust amount to £11774 there was a quasi victim impact statement from the Southern Trust which outlined how Douglas’ behaviour had affected her hard working colleagues and she had left wards short staffed which could’ve undermined patient care.

She submitted there were numerous aggravating features ri the offences including a “gross breach of trust” by a staff member in a senior position of responsibility and that the frauds were perpetrated over a “protracted period of time” and with two victims.

Ms Auret further argued that while Douglas had a clear record at the time she had been dealt with for fraud and theft since then including one offence where she used a credit card she found to buy items in Tesco and another where she stole crisps and bananas while working as a live in nanny.

Describing Douglas as a “fragile young lady” defence counsel Conor Lunny said she had managed to gather £1500 as part restitution which was “reflective of her remorse” adding that between her wage and benefits “she can offer to enter a repayment scheme of about £800 per month for what it’s worth.”

Conceding that “there’s clearly a degree of sophistication” to the frauds Mr Lunny revealed that a psychological report “is silent on the point of kleptomania or thrill seeking – she got away with it at the start and once that happened that emboldened her.”

“A reasonable person thinking rationally would be sat down and thought about it and would not have taken the risk…because the Trust as a government body was always going to find these anomalies” said the lawyer who told the court that “unsurprisingly she has been struck off the nursing register.”

He further conceded that while a jail sentence was almost inevitable and Douglas was “under no illusions about the likely outcome” Mr Connor urged the judge to find a degree of exceptionality in the case given her background and the facts of the case.”

Judge Lynch told Douglas she had been “in a high position of trust” within the hospital which she had abused before then abusing the trust of her new employers.

“Obviously you are an extremely dishonest individual who cannot accept responsibility for your own finances” Douglas was told by the judge who concluded there were no exceptional circumstances he could see that would justify keeping her out of prison.

In addition to the 14 month sentence half to be served in jail snd half on licence the judge also imposed a £25 offenders levy."
NOC,Northrop Grumman,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hZXJvdGVjaG5ld3MuY29tL2Jsb2cvMjAyMS8wOS8xMS9ub3J0aHJvcC1ncnVtbWFuLWRlbW9uc3RyYXRlcy1uZXh0LWdlbi1ldy1yYWRhci1pbnRlcm9wZXJhYmlsaXR5LWF0LWV4ZXJjaXNlLW5vcnRoZXJuLWxpZ2h0bmluZy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Northrop Grumman demonstrates next gen EW radar interoperability at Exercise Northern Lightning,"The Northrop Grumman Next Generation Electronic Warfare system making its first flight joined the AN/APG-83 Scalable Agile Beam Radar at Exercise Northern Lightning at Volk Field in Wisconsin.

Exercise Northern Lightning ran Aug. 9-20 2021 and included about 60 aircraft and nearly 1000 personnel from the National Guard Air Force Army Marine Corps and Navy. Aircraft and personnel from Davis-Monthan Air Force Base Ariz. also took part. Northern Lightning is a tactical-level joint training exercise replicating today’s air battle space with current and future weapons platforms.

NGEW and SABR demonstrated full interoperability in a realistic and contested electromagnetic spectrum environment.

“When an EW system and a radar are able to work together fully as demonstrated with NGEW and SABR pilots can take advantage of capability without compromise” said James Conroy vice president navigation targeting and survivability Northrop Grumman. “With the radio frequency spectrum becoming increasingly contested this critical set of capabilities will support the F-16 for many years to come.”

Flying on the company’s test bed aircraft NGEW and SABR demonstrated full pulse-to-pulse multi-function interoperability in a contested operational environment. With SABR successfully engaging multiple air and ground targets NGEW detected and identified a range of advanced threats employing advanced jamming techniques capable of defeating those threats when required.

At the exercise the two systems faced a high-density radio frequency environment generated by the Volk Field Combat Readiness Training Center Joint Threat Emitters. These threat emitters allowed Northern Lightning participants to fly missions under conditions representative of near-peer electromagnetic spectrum environments.

NGEW leverages an open-systems ultra-wideband architecture providing the instantaneous bandwidth needed to defeat modern threats. This F-16 system is part of a mature product line of electronic warfare capabilities that can be adapted to virtually any platform. An F-16 will fly with the safety of flight-certified NGEW system in the summer of 2022.

Building on a 40-year legacy of producing radars for the F-16 Northrop Grumman provides the SABR APG-83 Active Electronically Scanned Array fire control radar for the F-16 with advanced capabilities derived from Northrop Grumman’s family of highly successful 5th generation fighter AESA radars. The greater bandwidth speed and agility of the APG-83 enables the F-16 to detect track and identify a greater number of targets faster and at longer ranges. In addition it features all-weather high-resolution synthetic aperture radar mapping to present the pilot with a large surface image for more precise target identification and strike compared to legacy systems.

The agreement was issued under SOSSEC Consortium’s Air Force Open System Acquisition Initiative Other Transaction Agreement for prototyping. Northrop Grumman will continue to team with non-traditional defense contractors for the execution of this OTA project.

The US Air Force’s Skyborg program in particular aims to integrate autonomous attritable unmanned air vehicle (UAV) technology with open missions systems to enable manned-unmanned teaming.

Skyborg — which sounds like something out of a Terminator movie — must be able to autonomously take off and land fly in bad weather and avoid other aircraft terrain and obstacles the Air Force said.

New uninhabited aircraft ideas — whether low-cost attritable wingmen to manned or unmanned platforms in swarms or as stealthier designs that fly alone — are gaining traction in the era of great power competition.

And speaking of new ideas we have a new kid on the block so to speak.

Scaled Composites together with its parent company Northrop Grumman has unveiled a new unmanned aircraft design known as the Model 437 which could be configured as a “loyal wingman” intended to work networked together with manned platforms The War Zone reported.

Named Model 437 the UAS is based on the Model 401 optionally manned concept the company previously developed and flew in 2017 for the first time.

Model 437 is larger according to the company but its final configuration depends on customer requirements.

It also features a completely new fuselage and its wings appear to be better optimized for faster speed as well as for greater efficiency at those speeds.

Northrop Grumman says it could develop an unmanned version of the Model 401 to start test flights to faster advance the Model 437 concept with US Air Force funding Defense Brief reported.

It should be noted however that the company was initially one of five companies taking part in the Skyborg program but did not make the final cut.

According to the most recent US Air Force announcement Kratos and GA-ASI will be the final participants of the Skyborg program.

Scaled Composites developed Model 401 which it also refers to as the “Sierra” in just 24 months and first flew it in October 2017.

Like the Model 401 the Model 437 also has a top-mounted air intake for its engine which Aviation Week has reported will be a Williams FJ44-series turbofan.

With regards to the new Model 437 design it is expected to have a range of some 3000 nautical miles when carrying a load of 4000 pounds of fuel and will be able to cruise at around 0.8 Mach according to Aviation Week.

The drone has an internal centerline payload bay that is designed to carry up to 1000 pounds of stores or other systems as well.

The outlet was told said that a pair of AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAM) or a side-looking radar imaging sensor were two possible loadouts.

Another loyal wingman project is currently also underway in the UK and is known as Project Mosquito.

Northrop Grumman is already part of the team tasked with developing the UAS and will supply its DA/RC (Distributed Autonomy/Responsive Control) technologies which will enable human-machine collaboration and cooperative mission management.

The goal of £30 million (US$41 million) Project Mosquito is to create a demonstrator for the RAF’s Lightweight Affordable Novel Combat Aircraft (LANCA) concept with flight tests by the end of 2023 according to Aviation Today.

According to the RAF these aircraft could have capabilities to target and shoot down enemy aircraft and survive against surface-to-air missiles. They would fly alongside Typhoon the F-35 or the Tempest to provide protection survivability and information as part of the future combat air system.

“We’re taking a revolutionary approach looking at a game-changing mix of swarming drones and uncrewed fighter aircraft like Mosquito alongside piloted fighters like Tempest that will transform the combat battlespace in a way not seen since the advent of the jet age” Air Chief Marshal Sir Mike Wigston Chief of the Air Staff said in a press statement.

Meanwhile retired Lt. Gen. Dave Deptula head of AFA’s Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies argues Skyborg aircraft wouldn’t step on the toes of existing unmanned assets.

“They have the potential for dramatically changing the game in the conduct of air operations” he told Air Force Magazine.

“They can bring … more force inventory at a fraction of the cost of inhabited aircraft while facilitating the employment of dramatically increased weapons employment capability over a much shorter timeline than required with conventional aircraft.”

Nor does he expect this will mark an era when human pilots always get an unmanned sidekick.

“The spectrum of air operations spans from disaster assistance/humanitarian relief to global thermonuclear war — there are many missions across that spectrum of operations that will require manned aircraft without ‘uninhabited loyal wingman’ flying with them” said Deptula a former Air Force deputy chief of staff for ISR.

“That said there will be a large portion of combat air operations” that will need drones he noted.

These platforms are meant to help not replace the human brain Scharre added.

They can be flown closer to enemy air defenses and sent out on longer missions than legacy manned platforms. Drones could also play a new role as decoy electronic-warfare and kinetic strike missions.

It’s too early to speculate on what the right mix of unmanned aircraft might be as these platforms mature and are added into the inventory. Part of that discussion will depend on capabilities another on cost.

“It will probably take a generation but the balance of human-inhabited and uninhabited aircraft in the Air Force should shift over time” Scharre said. He expects that ratio could reach 20 unmanned aircraft to every one manned aircraft.

For instance each F-35 could have dozens of autonomous partners to make it more capable in battle.

Some believe there’s still more to do to equalize the unmanned enterprise with a service dominated by “fighter jocks” as Rep. Jim Cooper (D-Tenn.) recently called those who often snag Air Force promotions.

“I love leather jackets and fighter pilots but that’s not the future” the House Armed Services strategic forces subcommittee chairman said March 20.

“Unmanned aircraft as we’ve seen with drones are increasingly important in the world.”

Here’s where,"While Washington bickers about what if anything has been achieved after 20 years and nearly $5tn spent on “forever wars” there is one clear winner: the US defense industry.

In Iraq and Afghanistan the American military relied to an unprecedented degree on private contractors for support in virtually all areas of war operations. Contractors supplied trucks planes fuel helicopters ships drones weapons and munitions as well as support services from catering and construction to IT and logistics. The number of contractors on the ground outnumbered US troops most years of the conflicts. By the summer of 2020 the US had 22562 contractor personnel in Afghanistan – roughly twice the number of American troops.

The gravy train for the defense industry was also fueled by the way the wars were budgeted and paid for. Congress used “emergency” and “contingency” funding that circumvented the normal budget process. For the first decade of the conflict the US used emergency appropriations which are typically reserved for one-off crises such as floods and hurricanes. Detailed spending oversight was minimal. And because this type of spending is excluded from budget projections and deficit estimates it enabled everyone to sustain the pretense that the wars would be over shortly.

The result was what former defense secretary Robert Gates termed a “culture of endless money” inside the Pentagon. The defense department made the operational decisions; managed the bidding process for contractors; awarded the contracts (largely using non-competitive bids); and kept at least 10% of the wartime funding in classified accounts.

Not even the financial crisis of 2008 could interrupt the spending spree. While Congress imposed across-the-board spending caps on government programs war spending was specifically excluded. The Pentagon was able to use the special “contingency” war budget to buy upgrades services and new equipment that were barely related to Iraq or Afghanistan. Consequently the Pentagon budget kept growing – and was able to double its size between 2001 and 2020.

Defense stocks outperformed the stock market overall by nearly 60% during the Afghanistan war as the war spending surge enabled a wave of consolidation in the industry. The big five – Lockheed Martin Boeing General Dynamics Raytheon and Northrop Grumman – and a handful of others acquired the next tier of manufacturers such as Hughes Aircraft and McDonnell Douglas.

In the year to June 2020 the big five accounted for nearly a third of the $480bn obligated by the Pentagon to defense contractors. While only a fraction of these sales went specifically for Iraq and Afghanistan the conflict was highly lucrative for all the major defense contractors. For example Lockheed Martin manufactured the Black Hawk helicopters used extensively in Afghanistan; Boeing sold the aircraft and land combat vehicles; Raytheon won the major contract training the Afghan air force; and Northrup Grumman and General Dynamics supplied electronic and communications equipment. Thousands of subcontractors around the world earned money from selling night-vision goggles engines sandbags communications equipment and all manner of stuff to the war effort. And global oil companies were key war beneficiaries since the Pentagon is the world’s single largest purchaser of fuel.

Meanwhile the defense sector spent over $2.4bn lobbying Congress since 2001 and made direct campaign contributions to most members.

The US presence on the ground may now be over. But America will still have to digest the huge price tag

Not surprisingly much of the wartime expenditures were highly wasteful. The Inspectors Generals for Afghanistan and Iraq the Wartime Contracting Commission and the Pentagon’s own inspector general all documented waste profiteering corruption and “ghost spending” (money spent on activities that turned out not to exist at all).

According to government analysts the net result of the large-scale private sector involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan was to increase materially the cost of war operations. Much of the $145bn reconstruction money was spent on questionable projects with budgets that seemed excessive or simply could not be accounted for. Many such projects now destroyed and dilapidated have littered the front pages over the past week.

The US presence on the ground may now be over. But America will still have to digest the huge price tag. The wars were paid for entirely with borrowed money rather than raising taxes – a first in US military history – and the US still owes $2tn in future veterans’ benefits. This financial hangover will be compounded by the need to replace what has been destroyed or simply left behind and to pay for the weapons and equipment purchased during the last 20 years of go-go defense spending. The legacy of the post-9/11 defense spending binge will continue to gobble up the US budget for years to come.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjbXAuY29tL25ld3MvY2hpbmEvbWlsaXRhcnkvYXJ0aWNsZS8zMTQ3OTk3L3JlZ2lvbmFsLXN0YWJpbGl0eS1yaXNrLWNoaW5hcy1ncm93aW5nLXVzZS1taWxpdGFyeS1kcm9uZXPSAXNodHRwczovL2FtcC5zY21wLmNvbS9uZXdzL2NoaW5hL21pbGl0YXJ5L2FydGljbGUvMzE0Nzk5Ny9yZWdpb25hbC1zdGFiaWxpdHktcmlzay1jaGluYXMtZ3Jvd2luZy11c2UtbWlsaXRhcnktZHJvbmVz?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tension in the air as China grows its fleet of military drones,"And according to a report in late August by the Asahi newspaper Tokyo has decided to add drones to its coastguard to enhance surveillance throughout Japan’s territorial waters.

But China is not the only country developing and deploying drones in the region. In May the US temporarily relocated two MQ-4C Triton drones from Guam to the Misawa base in northern Japan – the first such activity by the US military since the drones were sent to Guam early last year.

Three Chinese military drones were spotted near Japan in late August prompting Tokyo to scramble fighters to investigate their activities. Accompanying the drones were a Shaanxi Y-8Q maritime patrol plane and a Shaanxi Y-9JB electronic intelligence aircraft according to Japanese officials.

China’s growing unmanned aircraft capabilities and focus on increasingly sophisticated military drones are causing headaches for its neighbours and risking regional stability.

Japan also this year started a development plan for an anti-drone system which aims to be able to ward off attacks from vehicle-mounted lasers by 2025.

The focus on drone technology adds more uncertainties to relations between China Japan and the US which are already under pressure over Tokyo and Beijing’s competing claims over the Diaoyu Islands – known to the Japanese as the Senkakus – as well as Japan’s military ties with the US China’s biggest geostrategic rival.

Timothy Heath a senior security expert at US think tank Rand Corporation said China was likely to deploy more unmanned aircraft in the future because of their flexibility lower risks and potential political and military benefits.

“Drones are especially useful in areas in which the potential loss of a PLA service member could spur a crisis – for example the death of a PLA pilot while operating in contested airspace near Taiwan Japan or in the South China Sea could generate a crisis due to the emotions linked to the loss of a service member” he said.

And a drone unlike human beings could be more politically useful according to Heath as it can be downplayed or played up depending on China’s needs.

“The large swarms of drones raise a dilemma for China’s rivals. If they tolerate the activity they grant China the benefits of asserting its presence in contested waters and allow a “de facto” Chinese routine presence. But if they attack the platforms they cannot be sure how China may respond” he said.

“China may ignore the loss of an aircraft or it may choose to respond violently to the attack. This could encourage rivals to behave cautiously.”

Heath said China could potentially use drones in countries along its Belt and Road Initiative routes where Chinese economic interests may be at risk from civil conflicts.

China is a leading global arms supplier with drones at the forefront of its foray into multiple countries. A paper on Chinese drone exports written by researchers from the University of Pennsylvania and Texas A&M University revealed 18 countries including Pakistan had obtained Chinese armed drones between 2011 and 2019.

Chinese military drones like the Wing Loongs – which means pterodactyl – can fly as fast as 370km/h (230mph) and as high as 9144 metres (30000 feet) while carrying a payload of a dozen missiles.

China is not only actively developing drones it is also studying how to counter them as the state-owned China State Shipbuilding Corporation – which supplies the PLA – revealed last year when it published a review of drone use in the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict.

Ridzwan Rahmat principal defence analyst at Janes said drones were useful for lengthy military reconnaissance missions an activity prone to fatigue-induced human error. “The deployment of such equipment removes the human error factor from operations increasing the efficiency and accuracy of its surveillance missions.”

With more drones joining the power game and China’s determination to defend its national interests experts said the whole region risked being destabilised.

Heath said China’s determination to change the status quo through grey zone tactics would leave its neighbours little choice but to invest in capabilities to counter the growing Chinese presence and capability. “The result is likely to be an escalating arms race and a high state of tension in the region.”

Grant Newsham a senior research fellow at the Japan Forum for Strategic Studies said Chinese military drones would alarm other countries.

“Drones will be employed as part of the PRC’s overall ‘harassment package’ that it deploys against Japanese naval and coastguard and air forces that are defending Japanese territory – land sea and air – in the southern Nansei Shoto [islands] and the East China Sea” he said.

“China’s aggressive behaviour that looks to dominate and take other people’s territory is widely recognised in the region. Drones are just another tool in the kit box that China makes use of to carry out its ongoing aggressive strategy.”

Here's What You Need To Remember: The Air Force wants the 5GAT drone for target practice in order to help fighter pilots prepare for dogfights with Russian and Chinese stealth fighters.

The U.S. Air Force soon could deploy a radar-evading target drone. One that easily could evolve into a front-line warplane.

California-based Sierra Technical revealed its prototype drone in photos the company released in mid-January 2020.

The Fifth-Generation Aerial Target or 5GAT is roughly the size of a T-38 training jet and like the T-38 boasts two J85 engines. The prototype with its sharp angles bears a passing resemblance to an F-22 stealth fighter albeit one without a cockpit.

The company plans to fly the drone for the first time in early 2020. The Air Force wants the 5GAT drone for target practice in order to help fighter pilots prepare for dogfights with Russian and Chinese stealth fighters.

The drone’s development is part of a wider Air Force effort to provide realistic training to its pilots for doing battle with the latest radar-evading warplanes. The service also plans to organize some of its F-35 stealth fighters into an “adversary” squadron that would play the role of the enemy during realistic war games.

As a bonus with a few changes the 5GAT could be so much more than a mere target.

The U.S. military uses a variety of drones as targets in live-fire exercises. The Pentagon also has deployed drones in combat in order to distract enemy air defenses most notably during the 2003 invasion of Iraq when Navy drones dropped radar-foiling chaff.

Aerial targets have formed the basis of front-line drone types. In 2017 the Air Force paid San Diego drone-maker Kratos $41 million to develop one of the company's aerial target designs into a low-cost pilotless strike aircraft that could fly alongside manned planes.

""The appeal of an unmanned system is that you can use it in ways that you wouldn't a manned plane such as sending it on more dangerous missions where you don't mind it being shot down"" explained P.W. Singer an analyst at the New American Foundation in Washington D.C.

The new target could join existing types performing a range of roles. Northrop Grumman supplies the military with a variety of custom-built targets. During the Vietnam War variants of Northrop's BQM-34 drone hauled cameras electronic sniffers and radar-jamming gear into enemy air space.

In the early 1970s the Air Force modified a few BQM-34s to carry missiles and bombs for testing.

Today the Air Force operates remote-controlled QF-16s drones that Boeing produces using retired early-model F-16s. Starting in 2015 the Air Force began working on computer code that quickly can transform the QF-16 into a robotic wingman for manned fighters such as the F-35.

""You take an F-16 and make it totally unmanned"" is how Bob Work then the deputy defense secretary described the Loyal Wingman program in 2016. ""The F-16 is a fourth-generation fighter and [you] pair it with an F-35 a fifth-generation battle network node and have those two operating together.""

The Loyal Wingman F-16 could fly alongside the F-35 until the stealth fighter's pilot directed the unmanned plane to fly ahead in order to probe enemy defenses. The drone F-16 also could fire missiles or drop bombs at the pilot's command.

The same software is slated to go into the Kratos strike drone and could transform the new 5GAT into a stealthy loyal wingman. “We believe that it has a high potential of solving some of the Loyal Wingman requirements once they’re defined” Sierra president Roger Hayes told Flight Global.

For starters while the 5GAT is supposed to be subsonic it still will be fast. “We’re going to limit it to high-subsonic” Hayes said. “It would probably go supersonic without much trouble but none of the structure was analyzed or designed for supersonic [flight] nor were the inlet lips.”

The 5GAT lacks a weapons bay but it could carry munitions on external pylons. “We can carry all kinds of electronics artificial intelligence gear [intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance] equipment” Hayes stressed.

The Air Force also has contracted with Kratos and another company 5-D Systems to build their own stealthy 5GAT drones for testing. The flying branch could pick one or more of the three designs for production.

Intel's High-End ARC Gaming Graphics Card Lineup ($300 - $500 US)

With that said let's talk about the upper echelon of the lineup which will feature Enthusiast ($400 - $499 US) and Performance+ ($300 - $399 US) graphics cards. These Intel ARC Alchemist GPUs will feature the 'SOC1' which could be the internal codename for the Alchemist 512 EU chip. This chip has a TDP range of 175W to 225W. The Enthusiast part will tackle the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 & the AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT.

Do note that Intel doesn't plan to launch an 'Enthusiast+' contender in its first-gen ARC lineup as that will be reserved for the next-gen. This means that the top graphics cards from NVIDIA & AMD such as the GeForce RTX 3080 and the Radeon RX 6800 XT will remain uncontested.

Intel's Entry-Level ARC Gaming Graphics Card Lineup ($100 - $200 US)

Moving on to the lower-end segment this is one place where Intel may hit AMD and NVIDIA hard considering both GPU manufacturers haven't released a single sub-$300 US desktop graphics card in the market yet. The mainstream segment will feature the 'SOC2' which is the Alchemist 128 EU GPU and will feature a TDP of 75W and up. ARC graphics cards based on this chip will be featured in the 'Mainstream+' ($150 - $199 US) and 'Mainstream' ($100 - $149 US) segment.

Both AMD and NVIDIA do have the chips to launch in the entry-level segment but they are being pushed to notebooks and laptops first. If launched prior to Q1 2022 then entry-level ARC GPUs will tackle AMD's Navi 24 (RX 6500 Series) and NVIDIA's GA107 GPUs (RTX 3050 Series) though those may end up over $200 US pricing considering where the mainstream cards are currently featured.

A major lead that Intel could have over the competition especially NVIDIA since AMD lacks in this department is AI assistance in supersampling technologies. Intel has already showcased an impressive demo of its XeSS technology and based on the expected numbers Intel GPUs could outperform NVIDIA's Tensor Core implementation (DLSS) with its XMX architecture. Intel is also expected to feature a small but useful game cache on its GPUs and will be equipped with higher VRAM capacities of up to 16 GB (GDDR6) across a 256-bit bus interface. This would be twice as much memory as NVIDIA's RTX 3070 and RTX 3070 Ti so they may have to prepare a refresh to counter it.

We have seen the Intel Xe-HPG Alchemist GPU-based discrete graphics card engineering sample leak out a few months back along with some rumored performance and pricing figures you can read more on that here. Based on the timeline the Xe-HPG Alchemist lineup will compete against NVIDIA's Ampere & AMD RDNA 2 GPUs since both companies aren't expected to launch their next-gen parts by the very end of 2022. The Xe-HPG ARC GPUs will be coming to the mobility platform too and will be featured in Alder Lake-P notebooks.

Scalpers and profit-hungry retailers would soon push prices even further.

However asking prices for RTX 30 series cards from Nvidia and Radeon RX 6000 cards from AMD have been reportedly falling as of late and Intel should soon be entering the fray with its DG2 offering that should make the market more competitive for buyers. So the figures from Graphically Challenged may be too pessimistic with US$1999 to US$2500 arguably being a more likely price range for the GeForce RTX 4090.

Official prices for the RTX 40 series cards won’t be decided by Nvidia until the very last moment as the graphics card market is certainly volatile and Team Green will want to price its products accordingly. However it is rumored that the Lovelace GPU-based RTX 40 series could offer twice the performance of current Ampere RTX 30 parts – so maybe twice the price for the flagship RTX 4090 model isn't as improbable as it first seems.

As you may recall this isn’t the first time Nvidia has pulled this trick and indeed at the beginning of 2021 the GPU maker resurrected RTX 2060 graphics cards (only just after they’d been discontinued) to help deal with RTX 3000 stock issues.

We’ve never really seen a let-up in those supply problems of course and if this rumor is correct we won’t be doing in the foreseeable because the contention on the grapevine is that Nvidia will be making these GPUs again except with one big change – the loadout of 6GB of VRAM will be doubled to 12GB (GDDR6).

That’s going by sources who spoke to VideoCardz about a new ‘PG161’ model featuring more RAM but the same TU106-300 GPU. Manufacturing is expected to kick off with a view to realizing these 2060 graphics cards at the end of the year with a possible on-sale date of January 2022 mentioned.

Analysis: Chip shortage misery seems increasingly desperate

With the availability and pricing of the RTX 3060 being so skewed thanks to the ongoing supply issues around this GPU (and other Ampere models) it wouldn’t really be a surprise to see Nvidia take this route (which as mentioned has been an alternative used before) to ensure some more affordable graphics cards are out there.

Doubling up the memory should help ensure these cards are better equipped to run contemporary games – the RTX 2060 still remains a palatable proposition for 1080p gaming at least even if you can’t expect to crank details and so forth with more demanding titles.

While all this does make some sense then as a rumor we should obviously be very cautious around the prospect (even if it is something Nvidia is considering right now the company may change its mind – who knows).

That said all we’ve been hearing of late is that the global chip shortage will keep its grip on the industry into and throughout 2022 so in that light it’s not difficult to imagine that continuing stock and pricing problems could well need alleviating in some manner.",,,

Ten classes spread across four days for six weeks.

For free … save a sandwich or two.

“Occasionally I get lunch” she says laughing. “I guess I’m a glutton for punishment.”

Channell is president of the board of directors for Mountaineer Homeschool Hub and its primary teacher.

“We are a homeschool enrichment center. What we do is offer classes and activities that supplement the five subjects that parents have to teach per state law” she said.

And in those classes students may do anything from science experiments and dissections to music appreciation crocheting forensics and some escape-room-style problem solving.

What started out unofficially in 2018 with an architecture class for eight students has grown to a nonprofit with 35 member families and 47 students.

Danielle Trumble and her son Connor were among the first to join.

“I love that someone is willing to plan and teach the messy hands-on things that I don’t necessarily want to be doing at home” Trumble said noting the appeal of homeschooling has only grown over the last year or so.

“During COVID the benefits of homeschooling need no explanation but we were homeschoolers even before that. My husband travels a lot for work. So we’ve always enjoyed being homeschoolers because it gives us the flexibility to travel with him if we choose to” she said. “Plus my son really likes that we set our own curriculum. He just started second grade and decided he wanted to learn physics. So that’s what we’re doing. I’m not sure that’s what normal second grade curriculum is right now.”

The Hub is getting ready to begin one of four six-week sessions at its new home which consists of 1214 square-feet in the old Woodburn school building.

Chanell explained that a $25 membership to the Hub not only gives families access to the enrichment classes but it also access to a curriculum lending library.

All that money goes back into the program.

“I volunteer my time. This is something I’ve wanted to do for a long long time. My joke was that I wanted to do it so I didn’t have to go back to working a nine-to-five job when my son graduated from high school. Well he graduated this past year” Channell said. “Luckily my husband is understanding and supportive. Hopefully within the next year we’ll get to the point where I can draw some salary.”

After the conclusion of each team’s third preseason game (fourth for Dallas and Pittsburgh) they all announced their official 53-man rosters on Aug. 31. The 2021-22 season will begin Thursday Sep. 9 when the Dallas Cowboys visit the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

A total of 1696 players make up the NFL’s active rosters. This year 1414 (83 percent) hail from FBS schools. Once again the SEC has the most players on active rosters with the Big Ten following close behind. The two conferences combine for 601 of the 1414 former FBS players and the top four teams with players on the active roster come from either the SEC or Big Ten.

HISTORY IN THE MAKING: Here are 5 FBS teams that could have a historically season

Alabama checks in at the No. 1 spot represented by 53 players on active rosters. Unlike the start of last season where they had no former quarterbacks starting in the NFL they now have three projected starters: Tua Tagovailoa (Miami) Jalen Hurts (Philadelphia) and Mac Jones (New England).

Ohio State LSU Georgia and Notre Dame come in behind Alabama to round out the top five. Notre Dame made a big leap between 2020 and 2021. Last year the Fighting Irish featured 29 players on active rosters; this year they jumped five spots with 34.

Outside of the ACC Big Ten SEC and Independent teams the first Pac-12 school to appear on the list is UCLA with 24 and the first out of the Big 12 is Oklahoma with 31.

Specifically a large number of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) come to fruition in the year 2021 alone and more are on the horizon.

This article will cover a slew of recently completed mergers and acquisitions and address the more significant questions like what is driving this trend and how it affects the semiconductor industry?

Recent Mergers & Acquisitions

Recently there have been three prominent M&A events:

The first noteworthy merger is Renesas' acquisition of Dialog Semiconductor. According to representatives at Renesas the investment benefits the company by allowing it to scale its IoT sector capabilities by leveraging Dialog's portfolio of low-power technologies. Specifically cited are Dialog's BLE WiFi and audio SoCs which Renesas feels complement its current MCU portfolios. Beyond this the company could benefit from an increased engineering and design scale for faster time to markets.

The second big merger of 2021 was ADI's acquisition of Maxim Integrated. The acquisition is meant to provide Analog with increased domain expertise and capabilities opening it up and positioning it well for various key market growth trends. Specifically ADI believes that Maxim's strength in the automotive and data center markets will be invaluable moving forward as it seeks to establish itself as a dominant player in both fields.

The final merger of interest is Nexperia's acquisition of NWF. Nexperia has been a customer of NWF for many years and now with the purchase it has obtained 100% ownership of the semiconductor production facility. The fab currently has a capacity of over 35000 200 mm wafer starts per month including technologies from standard MOSFETs to trench IGBTs which are a staple in Nexperia's portfolio. Beyond increased production Nexperia also feels that they benefit from NWF's significantly enhanced automotive-qualified product supply capability.

Though these companies that are on the purchasing side can stand to gain some major advantages; however why is this shift towards consolidation happening with larger and larger companies?

The Consolidation Movement

With so many non-trivial acquisitions in 2021 it's essential to ask ourselves: why is this happening? There probably is not one ""right"" answer but in general there are a couple of things to be said.

One explanation is that the market has become increasingly competitive since the turn of the century. In 2008 the top 10 semiconductor companies collectively controlled ~46% of the market share while the rest of the industry controlled the other ~54%.

Fast forward over a decade to 2020 and it seems that today the top 10 semiconductor companies own a collective 55% of the market with the rest of the industry controlling 45%.

This shift could mean that the industry as a whole has been moving towards consolidation with more and more market share being controlled by the big players over time.

One setback with this shift is that it can make it increasingly difficult for smaller companies to gain a significant foothold on their own hence leading to a need for consolidation (i.e. mergers and acquisitions). To compete in today's market companies often need to have a combination of breadth and depth in their product offerings which is nearly impossible to achieve without the large scales and diversity that come with mergers.

Overall this movement towards consolidation could have some effects on the semiconductor industry.

Effects of Consolidation

People who favor this market trend could believe that consolidation allows for better product offerings that work more cohesively. Instead of purchasing MCUs from one company SoCs from another and power solutions from a third it may be beneficial if one company could provide all three solutions. In this scheme systems design and component integration can become significantly easier since all components were designed to work together.

On the other hand this trend could seem a bit concerning for proponents of a free market.

The theory is if a select few groups own all the market share there will be less competition in the long run leading to decreased diversity innovation and consumer choice. While this point-of-view may seem a little Orwellian Moore's Law is a law of economics driven by competition and if that competition dwindles then innovation may as well.

This trend is already seeming to take shape in the lack of new companies becoming major players in the industry. Today's narrative is that a new innovative company will eventually be bought out and absorbed into the auspices of some larger semiconductor giant. Instead 50 years ago that innovative company may have grown into a semiconductor giant in its own right.

Overall recent years have seen an increase in consolidation in the semiconductor industry a trend that is expected to continue in the near future. While this trend could be alarming to some and welcomed by others only time will tell what ramifications it holds.

To promote the local IC design startups the Industrial Development Bureau (IDB) under the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) is supporting the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) and Arm a world leader in semiconductor IP design in providing critical resources to make innovative IC design accessible to startups in the region through a new initiative called the IC Design Platform for Startups. The combination of services and support from ITRI and access to Arm technology through its highly successful Arm Flexible Access for Startups program will assist startups in accessing critical IP and accelerating the launch of competitive products for the global market.

ITRI and Arm jointly created the IC Design Platform for Startups.

IDB Director General Jang-Hwa Leu pointed out that IC design startups often suffer from insufficient capital or resources inhibiting their ability to access critical IP and preventing innovative designs from progressing to the commercialization stage due to challenges around things like technology patents legal issues and capital. This new initiative will enable startups to better navigate these challenges by providing a platform through which they can access chip design support from ITRI (including system design and optimization chip integration solutions and advanced manufacturing processes) alongside no-cost access to more than 80 Arm products via Arm Flexible Access for Startups.

Chih-I Wu Vice President and General Director of Electronic and Optoelectronic System Research Laboratories of ITRI stated that the collaboration between ITRI and Arm is expected to achieve three objectives. First it invites global IC design innovators to come to Taiwan. Arm's global network and resources could assist foreign startups anchoring in Taiwan to speed up chip development. Second ITRI will contribute extensive industrial resources and experience to engage in IP conversion through its Nankang IC Design Incubation Center. In conjunction with Arm's diverse IP portfolio this joint effort will provide startups with inclusive chip design and wafer roll-off services quickly deploying niche chips to fulfill market demand. This arrangement should greatly improve the cash flow of startups and accelerate their time-to-market. Lastly by connecting Arm's global ecosystem of more than 1000 technology partners with Taiwan's unique semiconductor cluster in addition to electronic OEM/ODM software developers and the end application ecosystem this initiative will be critical to further positioning Taiwan at the center of the Asia-Pacific semiconductor ecosystem.

Arm Taiwan President CK Tseng commented that helping startup teams to innovate and go to market quickly and successfully is fundamental to promoting continued technological advancement. More than forty partners worldwide covering IoT autonomous vehicles terminal device AI wearable medical devices have taken the advantage of Arm Flexible Access for Startups since its launch. Any startup with less than USD $5 million in capital can join this program; by gaining no-cost access to a wide portfolio of more than 80 Arm products these startups have the freedom to experiment evaluate and innovate in chip design as well as access to Arm's global resources and ecosystem of other chip designers software developers technical support training and tools. With no fees for prototyping or test tape-outs the company then only pays a licensing fee at commercial rollout for the IP it uses. This allows startups to make better use of their funds while shortening their product development cycle by an average of 6-12 months.

ITRI offering extensive expertise in IP management and multi-disciplinary innovative technology and Arm providing broad access to leading technology through its Flexible Access for Startups program are committed to helping IC startups take root in Taiwan. The cooperation is expected to combine enormous resources providing global startup companies with comprehensive services from product development to worldwide marketing.

The impact of the global shortage of semiconductors on the automotive industry is gathering momentum with manufacturers not only scrambling to adjust production but shortages of finished vehicle inventory now seriously impacting on demand fulfilment. OEMs are unable to replenish stock at dealers and customers may be avoiding showrooms because of rising vehicle prices either putting off purchases or shifting to the used vehicle market.

Meanwhile there is no immediate relief expected from chip manufacturers even as many expand production capacity specifically for automotive customers. The lead time for this supply to reach the market still appears to be more than six months or longer away.

OEMs have struggled with supply since the end of 2020 with the issue gradually worsening in Europe and North America and increasingly impacting plants and OEMs in Asia particularly following issues at suppliers in South-East Asia. Up until the second half of the year most OEMs and dealers were able to meet demand recovery from excess vehicle inventory while most manufacturers have expected to make up for most lost production by the end of the year or early into 2022. Meanwhile OEMs have taken measures to prioritise production of higher profit vehicles over those with lower margins as well as removing certain electronic features from vehicles to allow production to continue.

But now the scale of lost production volumes looks too high to avoid serious impacts on sales volumes. IHS Markit forecasted that up to 7.1m light vehicles will not be produced globally because of the chip shortage estimates released before OEMs such as Toyota revealed further cuts this summer and autumn.

AutoForecast Solutions which has become an analyst of record for tracking the impact of the chip shortage in the automotive sector now estimates that the global automotive industry will see a loss in output of 8.5m passenger vehicles and light trucks because of the chip shortage nearly double its forecast of 4.57m in late June. AFS expects 2.58m units of lost output in North America and more than 2.5m lost in Europe (see table).

In the space of one week in September AutoForecast Solutions increased its forecast for lost output by nearly 450000 units following further divergences between actual and planned production according to Sam Fiorani vice-president at the firm. “General Motors losses increased by 86000 primarily in the United States and Canada. Renault-Nissan has been especially hard hit in the United States with nearly 265000 vehicles currently expected to be lost this year. Stellantis took large hits in North America and Western Europe across numerous plants. Maruti Suzuki [in India] and Volkswagen were also adjusted with more losses planned.”

Production losses are now translating into significant year-on-year declines in new vehicle registrations. New vehicle sales in the US fell by 17% year-on-year in August with low vehicle inventory and rises prices choking off demand. European markets saw similar declines in August with the German market falling year-on-year by 23% the UK by 22% and France by 15% respectively. August is a traditionally slower month for vehicle sales while August 2020 saw recovery in many of these markets following lockdowns however the declines bring volumes well below pre-Covid levels.

There are multiple reasons for the decline including economic uncertainty with the spread of the Delta variant of Covid-19 along with adjustments in government support in some markets. However there is little to suggest that underlying demand for personal mobility has significantly weakened but rather that waiting times and prices are impacting customer decisions.

Jaguar Land Rover dealers in the UK and EU for example told Automotive Logistics that current lead times for new models were now between 6 to 12 months. At Volkswagen while supply of its new ID.3 and ID.4 electric vehicles were relatively healthy dealers said waiting times were around five months for many new models.

The low supply has also disrupted purchasing habits in the US as well where it has become significantly more difficult to purchase new vehicles off dealer lots and more customers needed to buy a ‘build-to-order’ basis.

The chip crisis has forced dealers to sell virtually all new inventory and many are currently pushing sales of ‘nearly new’ models – if they can get their hands on used vehicles that is.

Vehicle residual values are at very high levels because of second-hand vehicle shortages and high demand.

Waiting on a chip

Supply of chips will only balance with demand when manufacturers have been able to increase production capacity. Officials in Taiwan have sought to reassure automakers that chip makers in the country are doing everything they can to alleviate the crunch. Wang Mei-hua the country’s economy minister told Reuters in August that chip production in the country should find balance by the fourth quarter of this year.

However Jochen Hanebeck the chief operating officer of German chipmaker Infineon has warned that the lead time for foundries to increase capacity could easily take until 2023. Top executives at Daimler BMW and Volkswagen meanwhile have all recently said that shortages were expected to impact production and sales well into 2022. Chip prices have risen by more than 20% in some cases.

The European Commission continues to push for local investment and production of semiconductors in Europe. Chipmakers are responding: Qualcomm Intel and Applied Materials have each highlighted ongoing efforts to boost production in Europe. Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon said that his company is open to working with foundries in Europe. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger announced plans to establish capacity for automotive chips at its foundry in Ireland with plans to invest up to €80 billion ($94.5 billion) in Europe and open two new chip plants over the next decade. Applied Materials the company that makes tooling to produce semiconductors has released two new tools to help efficiency in making chips for electric vehicles.

The Biden Administration in the US has set out similar ambitions to localise more manufacturing and here too many chip manufacturers are making significant investments.

But with dealers and OEMs depleting inventory and no immediate chance for replenishment it looks increasingly likely that sales volumes will feel the drag well into 2022. As both prices and lead times for new cars increase more potential buyers will be swayed to remarketed vehicles notably the ‘nearly new’ segment which are sold with OEM warranties. Meanwhile a ramp up in electric vehicle and plug-in hybrid production and strong purchase and tax incentives have pushed more customers towards electrified vehicles. Volkswagen has even launched a small-scale subscription model in Germany called AutoAbo for its ID.3 and ID.4 electric vehicles.

However these increases in EV demand will not be enough to correct shortfalls elsewhere notably for high-margin luxury vehicles or pickup trucks in the US. And in the medium term the supply crunch for the electric vehicle supply chain notably for batteries may be worse.

There is nevertheless scope for new vehicle sales to bounce back once supply and demand are realigned however it is unlikely that sales will recover enough to warrant making up for the scale of lost production in 2021 especially with the rush to used vehicles.

“So much of the current demand for vehicles is being absorbed by the used car market that we are seeing record prices for pre-owned vehicles. If not for the used car market draining off some of the demand sales of new vehicles could easily top records once the supply has recovered” says AutoForecast’s Fiorani. However he and others expect recovery once the chip issues are resolved over the next two years.

There is likely to be considerable pent-up demand after all and OEMs may again be rushing to make up for some lost demand. The risk for the supply chain is yet another bullwhip with high demand and a race to produce putting yet more pressure on supply and prices. Pressure on logistics and material capacity is likely to remain a constant for some time yet.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvZ2VvcmdlY2FsaG91bi8yMDIxLzA5LzEyL3dhci13aXRoLWNoaW5hLXRoZS1lY29ub21pYy1mYWN0b3ItdGhhdC1jb3VsZC10cmlnZ2VyLWl0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,War With China?

Fortunately there are ways to extend Moore's Law's cost feature and size benefits. One way is to use chiplets – or modular dies - that effectively bypass Moore’s Law by replacing single silicon die with multiple smaller dies that work together in a unified packaged solution.

This approach provides much more silicon to add transistors compared to a monolithic microchip. As a result chiplets are expected to return to the two-year doubling cycle that has been the cornerstone economics of the semiconductor business since 1965.

The global market for processor microchips that utilize chiplets in their manufacturing process is set to expand to $5.8 billion in 2024 rising by a factor of nine from $645 million in 2018 according to Omdia. (Image Source: IEDM 2017 AMD Dr. Lisa Su keynote)

Many major chip manufacturers are incorporating chiplets into their designs. For example

Intel recently revealed additions to its advanced packaging strategy and introduced two new 3D chip stacking technologies—Foveros Direct and Foveros Omi. Both packaging technologies will be ready for mass production by 2023. The former involves a base die on which chiplets can be stacked. Conversely Omni will allow the base die to be a different size from the top die.

Chiplets are not without challenges but they do provide many benefits. With a chiplet methodology a vendor may choose from a menu of modular dies in a library. Chiplets can have different functions and process nodes that can be mix-and-matched and then assembled in an existing advanced package or a new architecture.

Drivers

What is driving the trend toward chiplets? According to Dr. Amin Shokrollahi Founder and CEO of Kandou there is a combination of five factors:

The rising cost of taping chips out. Mask sets themselves can be multiple millions of dollars. The tendency toward ever-larger chips. Some have reached the reticle limits and others have just suffered from yield loss. The availability of multiple technologies to bind chiplets together including fine-geometry and traditional organic package substrates. The need to have each function in a process node and foundry that is specific to that function. Chiplets allow mixing and matching different geometries and different foundries. The need for flexibility in product offerings to meet various market requirements. Chiplets enable multiple products to be made from the same few chiplets.

Designing for Chiplets

How can chip designers take advantage of chiplet packaging for their products? While the significant semiconductor EDA tool companies provide proprietary software chiplet tools are not yet accessible to most of the market. Further standards are still being developed for this emerging technology. But there are key considerations that will help today’s designers.

It’s important to realize that using fine geometry interconnect between chiplets incurs some yield loss manufacturing complexity and overall headaches explains Shokrollahi.

“There are ways to effectively integrate chiplets that avoid the use of fine-geometry interconnect altogether” said Shokrollahi. “Using SerDes to connect chiplets mounted on traditional organic package substrates avoids these problems. Low-power ultra-short reach USR/XSR SerDes is the preferred solution for the high-speed interconnections between the chiplets.”

There is an art to carefully sub-dividing a large chip into tiles. Done well benefits can be large. One common mistake is having an I/O chiplet that only has a SerDes that results in this I/O chiplet being too small wasting the opportunity to shrink the larger main processing tiles. A better method says Shokrollahi is to put as much of the I/O subsystem as possible on the I/O chiplet. This can include the TCP offload packet segmentation credit management forward error correction and framing blocks as well as the SerDes. This solution requires a fatter pipe going to the I/O chiplet than is needed for just the SerDes.

Processing chiplets can often be replicated in tile form. These tiles enable different products with differing counts of chiplet tiles. Only two types of chiplets are needed in this tile solution one tile chiplet and one I/O chiplet. A router fabric or torus network is often devised to manage connections between tiles that are not attached to each other.

Two projects from the Optical Internetworking Forum (OIF) will produce Interoperability Agreements (IAs) for the SerDes that connect chiplets note Shokrollahi. The first is CEI-112G-MCM (Multi-Chip Module) project and the second is the CEI-112-XSR project. The MCM project uses CNRZ-5 modulation; the XSR project uses PAM-4 modulation. Both ongoing projects have different properties and are optimized in different ways. SerDes based on the MCM IA may be lower power and are useful in fat-pipe applications. SerDes based on the XSR IA are useful in thin-pipe applications and are more compatible with existing systems.

Using SerDes with either of these two IAs to connect chiplets within an MCM simplifies development because they avoid fine-geometry interconnects such as Chip-on-Wafer-on-Substrate (CoWoS) or INFO cites Shokrollahi. SerDes implementations have slightly more latency than those that use wires over a fine-pitch interposer. However the slow clock rate of the low-speed interconnects means that those solutions are likely to have a latency of at least two slow clocks. SerDes solutions also have error rates that must be addressed. XSR PAM-4 SerDes implementations aim to improve a raw error rate of 1E-9 through traditional Forward Error Correction (FEC) blocks. MCM CNRZ-5 SerDes implementations aim for a raw error rate of 1E-15 improved with minimal low-latency FEC.

Born in New York to a 19-year-old unwed Jewish mother and brought up by his great-aunt and great-uncle after his mother couldn’t support him Ellison is now the ninth-wealthiest person in the United States and the tenth-wealthiest in the world with a fortune of $93.9 billion according to Bloomberg.

Ellison never finished college but founded the company that would become Oracle with $1200 of his own money at age 33. Oracle now has some 135000 employees across the globe and recorded a net income of more than $10 billion in 2020.

Ellison stepped down from his position as CEO of Oracle in 2014 handing over the helm to Israel native Safra Catz and Mark Hurd while he became the company’s executive chairman and chief technology officer. Since Hurd died unexpectedly in 2021 Catz has been the company’s sole CEO.

Oracle opened facilities in Israel in 1996 and currently employs some 400 here. Ellison visited the country for the first time in 2007 and has been a strong supporter.

“Larry and I are deeply committed to Israel” Catz said earlier this summer on a visit to Israel. Oracle launched a massive new underground cloud data center in Jerusalem “because we love Israel and we know the country needs it” he said.

Ellison owns a number of impressive homes and properties including a Hawaiian island and makes a sport of owning and driving fancy yachts and aircraft.

He is also well-known for his philanthropic activities. In 2010 he joined a number of billionaires pledging support for the Warren Buffett and Bill Gates “Giving Pledge” under which he committed to give away at least 50% of his wealth. Ellison has separately said he will donate 95% of his wealth when he dies.

A close friend of former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu Ellison has been named as a potential witness in the trial against the Likud leader as part of Case 2000 the alleged bribery affair involving Yediot Ahronot. Netanyahu and his family recently vacationed on Ellison’s Hawaiian island Lania which he purchased in 2012 for some $300 million.

We all have our own memories of Sept. 11 2001 the day terrorists turned four planes into missiles.

A plane hit each of the two World Trade Center towers. A third plane crashed into the Pentagon. The fourth aircraft — the one Beamer was on — plunged into a field in Shanksville Pennsylvania.

Beamer grew up in west suburban Glen Ellyn.

Jefferson was raised on the South Side.

Beamer was on United Airlines Flight 93. His hijacked plane was believed headed to Washington with the White House and Capitol — symbols of our nation — ripe targets.

Beamer is best known for his stirring phrase “Let’s roll” said before he and several other passengers rushed the terrorists thwarting their attack plans when the plane crashed in rural Pennsylvania.

Using an Airfone attached to the back of a headrest on a seat Beamer simply dialed 0 and was connected to Jefferson a supervisor at the time at the Verizon Airfone Call Center in west suburban Oak Brook. The world knows how the passengers took on the Flight 93 terrorists because of that call.

The two — each calm and with remarkable presence — talked for about 15 minutes with Beamer reporting on the situation in the plane. The passengers by then knew about the WTC attacks from calls they were able to get through.

Beamer 32 on Sept. 11 was living in Canbury New Jersey. He was an account manager for the Oracle Corporation the father of two boys with another baby — a girl — on the way. He was traveling to San Francisco for a business meeting when the terrorists seized control of his flight.

A son of the western suburbs Beamer attended Wheaton Christian Grammar School and was a member of the Wheaton Christian High School class of 1987. The school in West Chicago is now called Wheaton Academy.

He went to Wheaton College a Christian liberal arts school where he met his wife Lisa. They graduated Wheaton in 1991. Beamer received an MBA from DePaul University in 1993.

Lisa Brosious Beamer was back on campus Friday for a 9-11 memorial in the Edman Chapel.

She recounted that Jefferson at first doubted Beamer because he was so calm. She explained “Todd loved his life but he knew that his life was much more than his 32 years on this Earth. His soul was secure even when his body wasn’t because Jesus was his savior.”

The children of Todd and Lisa Beamer David Drew and Morgan —born in the months following 9-11 — all went on to attend Wheaton College.

In 2006 Jefferson and former WBBM anchor Felicia Middlebrooks wrote a book about that day “Called” published by an arm of the Moody Bible Institute. Jefferson wrote about how Todd Beamer “sounded so tranquil it made me begin to doubt the authenticity and urgency of the call.”

“I could hear the cries and screams in the background as Todd Beamer painted in vivid detail the occurrences aboard the plane on that awful day” said Jefferson.

Lisa Beamer told the story to students — many not born in 2001 — of her husband’s last call. And how Beamer asked Jefferson to “pray the Lord’s Prayer and Psalm 23 with him.”

And after that Beamer and other passengers heroes all executed their plan to stop the terrorists. Said Beamer “Let’s roll.”

My 9-11 story

Twenty years ago on the morning of 9-11 I was at Midway Airport en route back to Washington D.C. waiting to board a flight that of course never took off as all air traffic was immediately grounded. I watched horrified while television monitors at my gate played video of the second plane crashing into the World Trade Center towers.

A few weeks later on Sept. 30 I was in New York at the site where the twin towers once stood reporting on then-House Speaker Dennis Hastert’s visit to the ruins. That was years before he left Congress and the sex scandal that surfaced that would lead him to a prison cell.

New York’s top leaders at the time of the attack — Mayor Rudy Giuliani and Gov. George Pataki — guided Hastert. I was able to tag along. We took a boat from a nearby pier to Ground Zero. What I’ll never forget: Seeing the twisted steel fragments of the twin towers.

I began making calls and assembling a team to help bring the vision to life. We wanted to create a brand focused on the inside conversation—the story behind the story the details and plot that only the true insiders knew. And we needed to marry the complementary powers of a new generation of prescient media executives those who understood the new distribution streams and the power of the creator economy with generationally talented journalists who themselves were excited to lean into this new world and express their talents across channels—via articles sure but also newsletters podcasts conference calls Zooms and (soon enough) live events.

I teamed up with an incredible group of media pros. I was introduced to Joe Purzycki a natural entrepreneur and start-up veteran who had helped pioneer Vox Media from a few employees into a colossus before his star turn at Medium. Most recently Joe had co-founded an innovative podcasting platform called Luminary. I was also connected with Max Tcheyan a marketing and strategy savant who had helped build Bleacher Report before masterminding The Athletic’s industry-defining growth strategy. And I reconnected with Liz Gough my former colleague from Conde Nast who had formerly been a star at McKinsey and Warby Parker. We all represented different paths in the media universe—content product subscription brand—and yet we were thrilled to share a new vision about the path forward one that encouraged elite creators to band together with all the important furnishings of the old world (brilliant editors legal vetting art direction and so forth) along with talismans of the new era (growth marketing a product-mindset and iterative strategy). We decided to call our company Puck after the ever omniscient and devilish Shakespeare character who always seemed to know what was going on with just the right ratio of acuity splendor and mirth.

We knew that in this new media age the creator is the heart of the business equation. And so the founding team endeavored to build our business around elite genre-defining journalists—pros in the prime of their careers who saw their subjects and audiences at an eye-to-eye level.

For years I had admired the work of Matthew Belloni most famous for his brilliant stewardship of The Hollywood Reporter. Matt by every measure is the greatest and most compelling bard of modern Hollywood. I became obsessed with his stories about the various definitions of the participation pools (he’d been a lawyer in a past life) his extemporizing on the studio executives and what was really going on inside the agencies. The Hollywood that he described was more compelling than any HBO show. He knew everyone and he knew everything. And he explained it all in a lucid and impartial manner that was exclusive to an insider and yet accessible to a veritable outsider. He was our very first hire.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvbWFya2h1Z2hlcy8yMDIxLzA5LzExL3RvcC0xMC1tdXN0LXNlZS1maWxtcy1mb3ItdGhlLWFubml2ZXJzYXJ5LW9mLTkxMS10ZXJyb3Jpc3QtYXR0YWNrcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Top 10 Must-See Films For The Anniversary Of 9/11 Terrorist Attacks,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/markhughes/2021/09/11/top-10-must-see-films-for-the-anniversary-of-911-terrorist-attacks/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvbWFya2h1Z2hlcy8yMDIxLzA5LzExL3RvcC0xMC1tdXN0LXNlZS1maWxtcy1mb3ItdGhlLWFubml2ZXJzYXJ5LW9mLTkxMS10ZXJyb3Jpc3QtYXR0YWNrcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmVrLmNvbS92aWRlb3Mvd2F0Y2gtc3Rhci10cmVrLWRheS1zdHJhbmdlLW5ldy13b3JsZHMtcGFuZWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Star Trek Day 2021 | Star Trek Day: Strange New Worlds Panel | Star Trek,Mica Burton hosts Star Trek: Strange New Worlds cast and crew as Anson Mount (Captain Christopher Pike) Ethan Peck (Spock) Rebecca Romijn (Number One) Akiva Goldman (executive producer) and Henry Alonso Myers (executive producer) discuss what's to come in the newest series set in the Star Trek universe.

There’s also a sanitary advantage as you don’t have to handle credit cards payment machines or cash.

While convenient payment apps do carry risks. There are right and wrong ways to use them safely. Tap or click here for our tips on locking down these apps.

The Dark Web counts personal and financial information among its wares up for sale joining the likes of weapons drugs fake money child pornography phony documents and more. Now PayPal accounts are also being offered in the illicit marketplace.

Here’s the backstory

The Dark Web has been a haven for stolen credit card information for a long time. But a study from cybersecurity firm Comparitech shows that credit card prices went down this year by 27% while prices for PayPal accounts went up 194%.

The average price of a physical cloned credit card is $171 or $0.0575 per dollar of credit limits. The study showed that the average price of a hacked PayPal account or balance transfer across all marketplaces is $197 or 9.2 cents per dollar in the account balance (which carried an average balance of $2133.61).

The price per dollar for PayPal accounts is almost double the price-to-credit limit ratio on physical credit cards. The price for PayPal changed depending on the type of account. Individual accounts were at the lower end going up to Premier accounts and topping off with Business accounts.

Why PayPal?

PayPal accounts are popular items on the Dark Web for a few reasons:

Buyers can access the account from anywhere they have an internet connection.

PayPal accounts usually have an existing balance.

PayPal is popular because it makes sending money easy. This works for crooks as well.

PayPal is accepted by countless merchants services and retailers.

So how are crooks stealing PayPal accounts? They typically use phishing attacks to steal usernames and passwords to PayPal accounts. That’s why you really need to be careful with unsolicited texts and emails.

Once they have stolen your credentials crooks can sell them to a buyer who needs only to log in and do what they want with the account. The seller can also transfer money directly into the buyer’s account.

If a stolen PayPal account is connected to a bank or credit card a crooked seller can transfer money from those sources. They can even use the account’s contact list to ask for money or make a purchase.

How to protect your PayPal and other accounts

Between data breaches malware and other forms of cyberattacks your online accounts can’t be 100% safe at all times. But you can take steps to minimize the risks. Here’s how:

The fee increase is the result of PayPal experiencing higher fees since the UK left the European Union.

Something that was being eagerly awaited was the new fee schedule which includes the additional percentage-based fees for international commercial transactions. The fee schedule which outlines all the fee changes set to take effect on November 10th can be found here.

The fee increase means that businesses making payments between the UK and Europe will be charged a 1.29% fee as opposed to the 0.5% most are currently paying. It’s not only PayPal having to make this change Visa and Mastercard have announced fee increases that are set to take effect in October.

Although PayPal’s rate for the rest of the world is a higher 1.99% this increase is still something businesses in the UK and Europe will have to take into consideration. The change will be particularly unwelcomed by small businesses many of which have already stopped exporting to the EU due to reasons that include costs.

Coinciding with the 50th anniversary of ""Grease"" Pepsi recruited the singer Doja Cat to put her own spin on ""You're the One That I Want.""

Celebrating 50 years of Grease with two new Pepsi flavours

The music video was directed by Hannah Lux Davis and choreographed by Sean Bankhead.

Doja Cat’s character enjoys a range of costume changes paying tribute to Grease’s heroine Sandy while sporting Pepsi-themed jewelry. But is Doja Cat more interested in the leather-clad hunk gawping at her or the can of Pepsi in his hand?

She follows artists such as Britney Spears Mariah Carey and Beyonce who have also featured in Pepsi adverts.

Doja Cat from Soundcloud to celebrity Pepsi spokesperson

In 2013 16 year-old Doja Cat began uploading her songs to Soundcloud. The following year she signed to Kemosabe/RCA and released her Purrr! EP. Doja Cat’s Hot Pink (2019) has been streamed over 10bn times worldwide.

""Pepsi has a great heritage in music and we couldn't be more thrilled to continue this legacy by partnering with Doja Cat around the launch of Pepsi-Cola Soda Shop"" said Todd Kaplan VP of Marketing at Pepsi. ""With a nod to the nostalgic soda shop flavours of the past Pepsi-Cola Soda Shop is sure to become an instant classic in our limited time offering lineup.""

""Working with Pepsi on this remake of 'You're the One that I Want' has been surreal"" said Doja Cat. ""It's such an iconic song and brand so to have the creative license to put my own spin on it for the launch of Pepsi-Cola Soda Shop was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity; I had to be a part of it.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2RidXNpbmVzc25ld3MubmV0L2FydGljbGVzLzE5OTk5LWNhbXBiZWxsLXNvdXAtcHJvbW90ZXMtbWljaGFlbC1waWVyc29uLXRvLWNjby1mb3Itc25hY2tzLWJ1c2luZXNz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Campbell Soup promotes Michael Pierson to CCO for Snacks business,"CAMDEN NJ. — Michael Pierson has been promoted to chief customer officer of the Snacks division at Campbell Soup Co.

On Aug. 25 2021 the soda brand Mountain Dew announced a new — and unusual — flavor: flamin' hot.

According to the brand's news release on the new flavor it's a blend between the soda's citrusy flavor and a Cheeto:

The 81-year-old beverage brand is no stranger to pushing flavor boundaries and FLAMIN' HOT' is no exception. MTN DEW tapped fellow PepsiCo brand CHEETOS® to unlock the cult-favorite taste of FLAMIN' HOT to create the first-ever beverage combining the sweet citrus DEW with a new spicy goodness.

The brand stated that the new flavor would go on sale starting Aug. 31 2021 exclusively online. We reached out to Pepsi which owns the Mountain Dew brand to ask if the flavor was still available as of this writing and will update this post if we get a response.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsaXR0bGViaXRodW1hbi5jb20vbnVtYmVyLTM0OS10aGUtcGVwc2ktYm90dGxlLWNhcC10aGF0LWtpbGxlZC1hdC1sZWFzdC01LXBlb3BsZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pepsi 349: The Bottle Cap That Killed at Least 5 People,"We independently assess all our recommendations.

How wrong can a marketing campaign go?

You might remember this commercial from Pepsi that featured Kendal Jenner solving the systemic issues behind the Black Lives Matter movement by giving out cans of Pepsi soda to law enforcement before returning to her group of fellow protestors. The ad which was released in 2017 was immediately met with backlash over concerns that its feel-good message of unity oversimplified the reasons for the movement’s existence.

It’s not hard to see why given that Kendal celebrates with her protestor friends as if handing a can of soda to a police officer solved racism.

But if you thought the Twitter shitstorm that came in the wake of that commercial was bad you haven’t truly seen Pepsi’s marketing department mess up big time.

Because in 1992 Pepsi would unleash one of the deadliest marketing campaigns in its history. The disastrous promo resulted in at least five deaths and more than 1000 criminal and civil lawsuits.

The Pepsi Number Fever Contest

“I remember this one! Your uncles aunts and I would check under every Pepsi bottlecap in case we found the winning number.” My mother told me. She was in her 20s when Pepsi launched their Pepsi Number Fever contest.

The year is 1992 and our stage is set in the sunny tropical paradise of the Philippines. The island nation’s economy is at one of its weakest points following several droughts a killer earthquake destabilization efforts by several political extremist groups and a typhoon that destroyed Cebu one of the countries urban hubs second only to the capital of Manila.

In short: a slew of economic troubles.

Pepsico had its own economic problem in the Philippines: the soda market was dominated by Coca-Cola.

Pepsi and Coca-Cola have had something of a blood feud between them since the 1980s as the two beverage giants vied to be the entire world’s soda of choice. Coca-Cola would go as far as sending a Coca-Cola can to space onboard the Space Shuttle Challenger in 1985.

On the other hand Pepsi became obsessed with proving themselves against Coca-Cola with marketing campaigns that encouraged comparison between the two soda brands particularly the “Pepsi Challenge.”

It was a hit and Pepsi tried to keep their momentum by follow it up with a contest that capitalized on the country’s high population lower value currency and relative poverty.

Picture this: A commercial comes on TV that shows a nurse barging into an operating room to ask the presiding doctor if he has the “number fever”. You can imagine how badly this would have been received in 2021 but this was in the Before Times. The nurse then explains how the game works.

The Pepsi Number Fever is similar to a lottery. Aspiring winners needed to look for winning numbers under the bottlecaps of Pepsico beverages. Possible sources for winning bottlecaps were the brands 7-Up Mirinda Mountain Dew and Pepsi itself. The contest promised a number of prizes but the most coveted of these was the million peso jackpot.

There’s something morbidly funny about watching the doctor and other hospital staff rush out of the operating room in a frenzy when you realize that that’s exactly what happened when Pepsi printed 800000 “winning” bottlecaps.

But before we move on to the riots deaths and lawsuits that ensued let’s take a moment to consider: “How much is one million Philippine pesos?”

At the time this article was written 1 million Philippine pesos is equivalent to $20034 U.S dollars. It is a nice chunk of cash. But if you ask me it isn’t enough money to riot and kill people over.

That being said remember that inflation affects how much money is truly worth. The $20000 USD jackpot would have had more purchasing power back in 1992. Add to that the fact that the cost of living in the Philippines is lower when compared to the U.S though not when compared to local wages and the massive economic disparity between the country’s socioeconomic groups and you start to see why so many people were furious when Pepsi backed out of giving all the “winners” their 1 million peso prize.

1 million pesos would have been a life-changing amount of money for a lot of people. It’s nowhere near enough for a house in the suburbs outside Manila today but in 1992 it was the opportunity of a lifetime for people like Marily So.

She was one of the millions of Filipinos tuned in to Channel 2 evening news when Pepsi announced their winning bottle cap number. According to Bloomberg Businessweek the then 23-year-old was living in a shack near a railroad with her four children at the time.

65 million people held their breath as they waited to see who among them would be lifted out of abject poverty. Then the big reveal.

349.

So and her husband combed through their collection of bottle caps and found that they were the lucky ones.

But so were 600000 other people.

Pepsigate: The Riots That Followed

Why would Pepsi promise to pay 1 million pesos to 600000 people an amount that comes out to 600 billion Philippine pesos or a whopping $12 billion U.S dollars?

The answer is: they didn’t.

Larry Henares Jr. a doctor of Economics and a very eloquent statesman recounts the incident in his blog the Philippine Folio.

“It all started as a ‘mistake’ of Pepsi-Cola” he writes. When Pepsi realized its very expensive mistake it withdrew the announcement and had it replaced with “134.” But people tuned in closely to the May 25 broadcast and they all heard “349.”

Two days after the broadcast thousands of people from all over the Philippines stormed the iron gates of the Pepsi-Cola factory located in Quezon City Manila. This was serious. If Pepsi withdrew the winning bottle cap number it meant millions of dreams of a better life would be shattered.

Hordes of people flooded into the streets of Quezon coming from as far away as Davao the southernmost major city of the country.

By noon there were lynch mobs outside the Pepsi factory waiting for a Pepsi executive they could hold accountable for the deception.

On Pepsi’s side the incident wasn’t a deception but an honest mistake. They explicitly told their vendor factories to not print the winning number of which only two were to be made as Pepsi would directly manufacture and ship them to the Philippines themselves.

But the local Pepsi executives realized that if they waited for orders from their U.S headquarters the Quezon-based factory was going to burn and they may have a few badly injured employees on their hands if they didn’t try to placate the crowd.

Pepsi asked the angry mob to accept $18 U.S dollars each as an apology from the company for what it explained was a printing error. Pepsi didn’t intend to print 800000 winning bottle caps after all.

That didn’t stop people from thinking Pepsi was guilty of misrepresentation. They argued that the winning 3-digit number could mean “anything from years ago to the minute before the winning number is announced.” Participants in the Pepsi Number Fever contest had reason to believe they had a fair and equal chance to win.

The intended winning bottle caps were printed with code numbers “L-2560-FQ” and “L-3560-LQ.” It was reasonable to expect that if your 349 bottle cap had either then you had a legitimate claim to the prize.

This is when the lawsuits started to pour in.

Wealthier 349 winners began to call their lawyers who advised them to reject the measly 500 peso consolation prize and encouraged the participants to sue Pepsico into oblivion.

While Pepsi scrambled to deal with the slew of civil and criminal lawsuits being filed against it it also had to contend with violent customer riots that led to targeted attacks on their factories and employees leaving five people dead within the year.

Thousands of Winners Hundreds of Lawsuits

Of the hundreds of lawsuits that were filed against Pepsico by disgruntled customers Henares Jr. identified six people who claimed to have won the million peso prize.

Sgt. Socrates Jimenez of the Army Operation Center in Fort Bonifacio.

Juliet Pineda a resident of Valenzuela City.

Jose R. de la Cruz a resident of Fairview Quezon City.

Lilia Ramos who came all the way from Davao City; and

Joseph Ilagan another local Quezon City resident.

Lawyers began preparing a class action suit against Pepsico for 7 billion pesos plus damages in what would have been the most expensive lawsuit in Philippine history.

But as it stands Pepsi couldn’t just pay billions in prizes.

Henares given his position was in the same circle as Luis “Moro” Lorenzo the local franchise holder of Pepsi Cola Products Phil. Inc. (PCPPI). He’s a family friend of the Henareses and Henares Jr. claims to have spoken with close relatives and friends of the magnate who gave him the inside scoop.

Pepsi paid 126 million pesos in apology prizes to holders of the 349 bottlecaps as of June 3 1992.

Around 100000 people claimed to have won the 1 million peso prize a total of 100 billion pesos.

If all 349 bottle caps were to be honored it would cost Pepsico roughly 700 billion pesos – more than twice the national budget of the Philippines at the time. At $27 billion dollars it would have been about as large as the Philippines’ foreign debt.

The worst part? Pepsico was the one behind the Number Fever contest but it was Pepsi Cola Philippines the franchise that had to do damage control and pay for the 126 million pesos of apologies to angry customers.

Of the hundreds of lawsuits that were filed against Pepsi I was able to track down four that reached the Supreme Court of the Philippines:

So of course I had to read all of them.

Pepsi won in the first case. The Court found that the 349 bottle caps that the petitioners had didn’t have any of the eight security codes that corresponded to winning 349 bottle caps. The case cites three more Pepsi 349 fiasco-related lawsuits not listed above as a basis for ruling in favor of Pepsi.

The second case suffered from the same problem leading to Pepsi winning it as well. The same happened with the third case. You might think that the fourth listed case is the one where Pepsi loses but no. The petitioners are actually Pepsi execs themselves suing the Court of Appeals justice for hastily issuing arrest warrants against them.

It’s true that Pepsi lost a lot of money during the 349 incident but it seems they came out relatively unscathed when you think about how big of a scandal the bottle cap printing errors caused.",,,

Philip Dormitzer the chief scientific officer at Pfizer made the comments to a Zoom gathering of academics last week. They were first reported by Channel 12 news on Friday night.

“Early in the pandemic we established a relationship with the Israeli Ministry of Health where they used exclusively the Pfizer vaccine and then monitored it very closely” Dormitzer told the gathering “so we had a sort of laboratory where we could see the effect.”

He added that Israel “immunized a very high proportion of the population very early — so it’s been a way that we can almost look ahead: What we see happening in Israel happens again in the US a couple months later.”

On Sunday morning Health Ministry Director General Nachman Ash rejected the claim that Israel had any sort of exclusive deal with Pfizer. “There is no exclusivity with Pfizer in any shape or form” he told 103FM radio. “Currently those over 18 who are getting vaccinated are prioritized to receive the Moderna vaccine.”

Ash said that Israel is “studying the statistics and the world certainly learns from them but I am not prepared to use the word ‘laboratory.’ Yes the company is learning from us about the [effectiveness] of the third dose but there is no connection to harming the interests of Israeli citizens.”

Israel was an early leader in COVID vaccinations after having cut a deal with Pfizer to receive a large number of vaccine doses before many other countries. It also purchased a smaller number of Moderna vaccines which it began using more widely in July and August when its Pfizer stockpile neared expiration. Israel rolled out its vaccines rapidly to large portions of the population vaccinating 50 percent of all residents by March then began an unprecedented rollout of third booster shots in August. As of Sunday more than 2.8 million people had received a third dose.

Prominent anti-vaccine activists both in Israel and around the world seized on Dormitzer’s comments over the weekend. Eldad Yaniv a vocal critic of the government’s COVID approach shared the Channel 12 report and said it provides further support for the decision of those Israelis “who do not agree to take part in the Pfizer experiment being operated in Israel.”

Others claimed that Dormitzer’s comments had been taken out of context and improperly translated and sensationalized by Channel 12. The Pfizer scientist did not say that Israel and Pfizer had an exclusive deal but rather that Israel “used exclusively the Pfizer vaccine.” He also didn’t call Israel a laboratory but said its vaccine rollout provided an opportunity for “sort of a laboratory.”

Pfizer later clarified Dormitzer’s comments in a statement to Channel 12 news.

“Pfizer is aware of a video clip featuring an interview with one of our scientists who unfortunately misspoke on a key point we wish to clarify: We are grateful for the cooperation between Pfizer and the Israeli Health Ministry. It is not a clinical research study. This is a non-interventional ‘real world’ evidence data collection collaboration.”

The pharmaceutical company also noted that it had no exclusive deal with Israel and “the country does not serve as a laboratory but rather as the first nation to achieve significant rates of vaccine uptake it was able to evaluate real world vaccine and duration of protection and share data with the world.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL3dvcmxkL2FmcmljYS9zYWZyaWNhcy1yZWd1bGF0b3ItYXBwcm92ZXMtcGZpemVyLWNvdmlkLTE5LXNob3QtY2hpbGRyZW4tMTItdXAtMjAyMS0wOS0xMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,S.Africa's regulator approves Pfizer COVID-19 shot for children 12 and up,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/safricas-regulator-approves-pfizer-covid-19-shot-children-12-up-2021-09-11/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL3dvcmxkL2FmcmljYS9zYWZyaWNhcy1yZWd1bGF0b3ItYXBwcm92ZXMtcGZpemVyLWNvdmlkLTE5LXNob3QtY2hpbGRyZW4tMTItdXAtMjAyMS0wOS0xMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vYWJjN2NoaWNhZ28uY29tL2NvdmlkLWluLWtpZHMtdmFjY2luZXMtZm9yLWNoaWxkcmVuLXBmaXplci12YWNjaW5lLWZkYS8xMTAxNTMzMy_SAVxodHRwczovL2FiYzdjaGljYWdvLmNvbS9hbXAvY292aWQtaW4ta2lkcy12YWNjaW5lcy1mb3ItY2hpbGRyZW4tcGZpemVyLXZhY2NpbmUtZmRhLzExMDE1MzMzLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,COVID vaccine: Why children under 12 are not yet eligible for Pfizer Moderna coronavirus shots,"Why children under 12 are not yet eligible for COVID vaccines

The FDA warns that parents should not seek out COVID vaccines for children under 12 as pediatric cases soar.

Anxiety is high among parents as more kids head back to school without the protection of a COVID-19 vaccine for at least a few more months.

Parents have a reason to be concerned. After months of declining cases the virus is finding the unvaccinated.

Adolescents as young as 12 can be vaccinated against COVID-19 but younger children aren't eligible yet.

Children made up more than a quarter of the reported cases for the week ending September 2. ""After declining in early summer child cases have increased exponentially with over 750000 cases added between August 5 and September 2"" the American Academy of Pediatrics said Tuesday. The most recent weekly case number marks about a 250% increase since the week of July 22-29 when the AAP counted 71726 new cases in children.

Children have largely been spared the worst of COVID-19 -- hospitalizations and deaths are more rare for children than for adults -- although children's hospitals are filling up in COVID-19 hotspots around the country.

MORE: COVID-19 cases in children reach levels not seen since winter surge

Dr. Mark Kline the physician-in-chief of Children's Hospital New Orleans describes the increase of young children infected with COVID-19 and details how to best prevent spread among kids.

A kids' vaccine cannot come soon enough but the process is taking longer than some initially expected.

""We had really hoped that maybe we would have something in place before we tried to bring kids back into the school classroom but unfortunately we haven't been able to do that"" said Dr. Emily Chapman senior vice president and chief medical officer at Children's Minnesota.

Timeline for younger children's COVID-19 vaccines

Trial data are still being gathered for COVID-19 vaccines for younger children. Once the vaccine companies have trial results they'll need to submit the information to the US Food and Drug Administration which will assess the vaccines for authorization.

Dr. Scott Gottlieb a former FDA commissioner who now sits on the board of COVID-19 vaccine maker Pfizer said earlier this month on CBS' Face the Nation that the company will likely be able to file the data for 5-11-year-olds for authorization ""at some point in September"" and then file the application for an emergency use of the vaccine ""potentially as early as October.""

""That'll put us on a time frame where the vaccines could be available at some point late fall more likely early winter depending on how long FDA takes to review the application"" Gottlieb said.

There's no official timetable once a company submits to the FDA. Emergency use considerations can take several weeks.

""There's always something that makes things not the way we think"" said Dr. Stanley Perlman who is on the FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee and is also a pediatrician and professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Iowa Health Care. ""Obviously we want it done as soon as possible but we want it done right.""

When asked earlier this month whether a COVID-19 vaccine will be authorized for young children before Thanksgiving Dr. Anthony Fauci director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that he hopes so but he does not want to get ahead of the FDA.

""They should be getting the data at least in one of the companies by the end of September"" noted Fauci.

""Then the data will be presented to the FDA and the FDA will make a determination whether they will grant that under an emergency use authorization or some other mechanism.""

CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said during a National Parent Teacher Association town hall earlier this month that she is hopeful the Pfizer vaccine will be available for kids in 2021.

""Everybody is looking at this with urgency. Everyone recognizes how important it is for those children to have access to vaccines"" she said when asked about the timeline. ""My understanding of the timeline is pretty consistent with what is being said: the middle of fall is my understanding early fall is when we will anticipate seeing the data and then it will lie with the hands of the FDA. And I'm hopeful for the end of the year.""

Data for 2-to-5-year-olds could arrive soon after the older kids' data. For the youngest children Pfizer told CNN it could potentially have enough research by October or November and shortly thereafter ask the FDA to authorize emergency use.

Moderna's trial is underway but is a few months behind Pfizer. Johnson & Johnson doesn't expect its multiple trials in children to even start until the fall.

Why a vaccine for younger children takes longer

Hundreds of millions of adults have been vaccinated proving that the COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective but those results are not a substitute for the research needed in kids.

""As much as we would like to go ahead and start vaccinating our children now it's most important that we take this time to ensure that the science is rigorous"" said Minnesota's Chapman.

For the kid's version of the COVID-19 vaccine scientists use results from the adult trials and a full pediatric trial.

Having the adult research speeds up the process. For people as young as 12 Perlman explains the companies didn't have to enroll the 30000 people it needed for adult trials because it could do what's called ""immunobridging."" The data showed that for this age group the immune response was the equivalent of adults'.

Companies take a similar approach with the younger kids but in early August the FDA asked for six months of follow-up safety data instead of the two months it asked for with adults. It also asked Pfizer and Moderna to double the number of children ages 5 to 11 in clinical trials.

Vaccine advisers to the CDC said in June there is a likely association between the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines and extremely rare cases of heart inflammation in adolescents and young adults but the benefits of vaccination still clearly outweigh the risks. The inflammation cases appeared to be mild and they resolved quickly on their own or with minimal treatment.

At Texas Children's Hospital interim pediatrician-in-chief Dr. James Versalovic said it was no problem to recruit more kids for the Pfizer and Moderna trials. Many trial sites have long waiting lists. The trial expansion though added at least a month more to the research process.

""We all agreed it was worthwhile just to make the trials even more robust data to provide that additional level of reassurance to parents across the country. It does lengthen the trial but just a bit"" Versalovic said.

'Children are not small adults'

Children's vaccine trials actually start in adults.

""Typically every vaccine candidate even for other conditions would be evaluated first in adult patients and then in progressively younger ages"" explained Dr. Kari Simonsen who is leading the trial of the Pfizer vaccine at Children's Hospital & Medical Center in Omaha. ""We can't make assumptions about the safety or tolerability of medicines in children being the same as for adults"" she said.

It's because of biology.

""As we are fond of saying in pediatrics: Children are not small adults. Children are children"" said Versalovic. ""Their bodies are developing and will react differently and we need to treat them differently.""

When it gets to the kids' phase of the testing scientists make their best educated guess on what dose would be safe and generate an immune response. The levels and timing is based on development stages.

""By and large our children have very active and responsive immune systems and so we suspect that smaller doses of vaccine will trigger an adequate response in a child to successfully fight off infection"" said Chapman.

As with any vaccine testing it must go through a three-phase trial before the FDA can authorize it. The first phase tests to see if the vaccine is safe in about 20 to 100 healthy kids.

Since these are expedited trials scientists have combined phases 2 and 3 of the trials so they can do more steps in parallel Versalovic said. In these phases scientists monitor safety and test to see if the children's immune systems respond to the vaccine. At this step scientist recruit hundreds or even thousands of children. Some get vaccine some get placebo and results are compared.

Only after these steps are complete can a company ask the FDA for authorization or approval.

If the FDA signs off on it the vaccine gets another set of expert eyes with the CDC's Advisory Council on Immunization Practices. That committee also puts together a formal recommendation around the delivery storage timing distribution and administration of the vaccine. The committee's recommendation becomes official when the CDC director reviews and approves it.

In these intervening months the experts say children can stay COVID-19 free. Adults though will have to help them.

""Best thing we can do for them is surround them with adults who are vaccinated"" Chapman said. ""And surround them with people who are masking and keep their masks on as much as possible.""

“It is the exact same vaccine” SCPH Medical Director Dr. Erika Sobolewski said in a statement posted on the health department’s Facebook page. “As new lots are manufactured the labeling will change.”

“We hope this explanation helps build your confidence in the product provided by Pfizer-BioNTech” the health department wrote. “If you want to receive this vaccine you can come to our Weekly Wednesday drive-thru vaccine clinic. As long as we have it in stock we’ll gladly provide it to you.”

So you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.

Over the past month shares of this world's largest consumer products maker have returned +5.8% compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.2% change. During this period the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry which P&G falls in has gained 6.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?

While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.

Earnings Estimate Revisions

Rather than focusing on anything else we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.

Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price investors tend to buy the stock resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.

For the current quarter P&G is expected to post earnings of $1.37 per share indicating no change from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.4% over the last 30 days.

For the current fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.55 points to a change of +11% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days this estimate has changed +1.6%.

For the next fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.97 indicates a change of +6.3% from what P&G is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month the estimate has changed +0.3%.

Having a strong externally audited track record our proprietary stock rating tool the Zacks Rank offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate along with three other factors related to earnings estimates P&G is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Projected Revenue Growth

While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.

In the case of P&G the consensus sales estimate of $20.81 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +1.3%. The $84.32 billion and $87.18 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +2.8% and +3.4% respectively.

Last Reported Results and Surprise History

P&G reported revenues of $20.2 billion in the last reported quarter representing a year-over-year change of +0.6%. EPS of $1.52 for the same period compares with $1.37 a year ago.

Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.48 billion the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.41%. The EPS surprise was +7.04%.

The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.

Valuation

No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.

Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples such as its price-to-earnings (P/E) price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF) to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued overvalued or undervalued whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.

As part of the Zacks Style Scores system the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on) making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued rightly valued or temporarily undervalued.

P&G is graded D on this front indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.

Conclusion

The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about P&G. However its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

It’s too early to know how or if the 19-month-long strike connects with this lawsuit filed Wednesday in Lucas County (Ohio) Common Pleas Court by Allan Block of Toledo Ohio. He’s the CEO of Block Communications Inc. which owns the PG its Toledo sister paper The Blade as well as Pittsburgh City Paper and other businesses including cable companies and TV stations. His suit accuses others in his family of scheming to sell all of it without his input.

The suit doesn’t mention the PG strike. Zack Tanner president of the Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh one of the unions that walked out in October 2022 said the lawsuit has no impact on the strike.

“The Blocks are no strangers to infighting” Tanner said on Thursday. “If you worked at the paper for a minute or for 50 years you know the Blocks like to fight with each other. No big news there. But our fight is our fight. They can fight internally but we’re still committed to winning the strike.”

Tanner said he remains confident the striking unions will prevail. A National Labor Relations Board judge has ruled strongly in the strikers’ favor he noted and the NLRB’s regional office recently took the unusual step of signaling its intent to seek an injunction that could bring the strikers back to work under their last contract and compel the company to bargain in good faith a new one.

“We’ll have our day in court and we will win the strike” Tanner said “no matter whether the Blocks are fighting with each other.”

In the suit Allan Block seeks a preliminary injunction to prevent BCI from being sold by his brother Pittsburgh’s John R. Block and others who run the company several of whom also live in the Pittsburgh area.

The motion says John Block — the publisher and editor-in-chief of the two newspapers — several times has tried and failed to replace the plaintiff Allan Block as CEO a position he is contracted to hold until 2028. “Now in a last-ditch effort to assert his so-called ‘sovereignty’ John Block has conspired with the rest of the Director Defendants to exclude Plaintiff from the most major decision to ever face BCI in its over 100 years of existence: a full sale of all its assets.”

The privately-held BCI started in 1901 by the Block brothers’ grandfather Paul Block is not currently for sale but the motion says that in January John Block “caused BCI to form a strategic transaction committee to pursue a merger or acquisition of the company.” That committee the suit says excluded Allan Block.

That news and the possibility raised in the motion that this committee making a “rushed and haphazard” sale “will result in significant job losses” was concerning to people who are working for those businesses as well as those who are on strike especially at a time when newspapers specifically and media in generally are struggling.

The Block family’s struggle for control of BCI looks to play out in court as does the strikers’ struggle for a contract.

The motion confirms that Allan and John Block each have a 25% stake in BCI while the other 50% is owned by family trusts that benefit family members.

Listed as defendants in the suit in addition to BCE and John Block are William Block Jr. exempt and non-exempt trusts Donald G. Block exempt and non-exempt trusts Karen D. Johnese exempt and non-exempt trusts Barbara L. Block exempt and non-exempt trusts Block Family trust No. 2 Karen Johnese Diana Block Ron Davenport Nancy Reid and Emily Escalante.

Donald Block who lives in Fox Chapel in February was named president of Pittsburgh City Paper after it was purchased by a BCI subsidiary.

Meanwhile workers in four production unions went on strike at the Post-Gazette in October 2022 over a dispute that left them without health care coverage. Journalists in the Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh joined them later in their own unfair labor practices strike which is now in its 19th month. The Guild’s issues go back farther than that in that the union’s last contract expired in 2017 and in 2020 the PG citing an impasse in contract bargaining imposed conditions including a company health plan on the workers.

In April the striking journalists learned that the regional office of the National Labor Relations Board had received approval from the NLRB to seek an injunction in their case in which a NLRB administrative law judge had in January 2023 ruled strongly in favor of the union. The judge ruled that the company had to bring the strikers back to work under their last contract and bargain a new one. The company appealed that decision and the appeal has yet to be heard by the NLRB. The union is expecting the regional NLRB office to file the injunction — called a 10(j) injunction — any day now but until it is doesn’t know the scope of what the NLRB wants a judge to order.

It’s a complicated situation and one with many moving and not moving parts.

Also in April one union the distribution workers ended its strike with the PG agreeing to do so and dissolve their union in exchange for severance payments.

The remaining unions still on strike have stressed that the Post-Gazette could settle with them at any time. The most recent actual bargaining sessions that the Pittsburgh Union Progress knows about and attended were in September of 2023. (One union met with company representatives in February to set bargaining dates but the Union Progress doesn’t know if any subsequent sessions happened.)

The Blocks’ commitment to the Post-Gazette is unclear though John Block said on Wednesday in a statement to The Blade that he remains “committed” to the PG as well as The Blade.

In a brief statement given to The Blade and other outlets a representative of Allan Block seemed to contradict that writing “It is unfortunate that certain Block family members would choose to further enrich themselves at the expense of local jobs and the communities that depend on local news coverage.”

Phone calls and messages from the Pittsburgh Union Progress to Allan Block John Block and Donald Block seeking interviews or comments about the lawsuit and the strike were not returned.

A small contingent of striking journalists went to John Block’s home on Wednesday and he was not home so a small group returned on Thursday evening. A man who answered the door said Block was not home and that the group could try again Friday.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDE5LmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA5L3BnLXNpdHRlbmZlbGQtY29ycnVwdGlvbi1jYXNlLWZlZGVyYWwtYXBwZWFscy1jb3VydC1oZWFyLWFyZ3VtZW50cy10aHVyc2RheS_SAXxodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3gxOS5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8wOS9wZy1zaXR0ZW5mZWxkLWNvcnJ1cHRpb24tY2FzZS1mZWRlcmFsLWFwcGVhbHMtY291cnQtaGVhci1hcmd1bWVudHMtdGh1cnNkYXkvP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,P.G. Sittenfeld corruption case: Federal appeals court hears arguments Thursday,"CINCINNATI (WXIX) - Attorneys for former Cincinnati City Council member P.G. Sittenfeld returned to a federal courtroom Thursday to try to overturn his convictions for bribery and attempted extortion.

A three-judge panel with the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments from his attorneys and then federal prosecutors.

No decision is expected anytime soon.

Sittenfeld 39 of East Walnut Hills is one of three former Cincinnati council members arrested in 2020 and convicted on federal public corruption charges in a series of cases federal authorities launched in 2017.

At the time of his arrest Sittenfeld was the front-runner in the mayor’s race and repeatedly received the most votes in city council elections.

Sittenfeld rejected a plea deal before his trial that would have limited his punishment if found guilty from probation only to two years or less in prison court records show.

The jury did find him not guilty on four of the six total charges. Those were two counts of honest services wire fraud and one count each of bribery and extortion.

Last year U.S. District Court Judge Douglas Cole rejected Sittenfeld’s request to throw out his convictions and get a new trial.

Sittenfeld failed to present “any persuasive arguments” supporting either motion the judge wrote in his 26-page order.

Judge Cole sentenced Sittenfeld to 16 months in prison and one year of supervised release once he’s out.

In early January Sittenfeld reported to a prison in northeastern Kentucky. Federal Correction Institution of Ashland is a minimum-security prison about 2.5 hours away from Cincinnati.

It was listed as one of America’s “10 Cushiest Prisons” by Forbes magazine.

Federal prosecutors say Sittenfeld promised to support perform “official acts” and “deliver the votes” to help the development of a property with sports betting at 435 Elm Street across from the Duke Energy Convention Center in downtown Cincinnati in exchange for $20000 in donations to his political action fund (PAC) federal court records show.

His indictment alleged he solicited the money in exchange for his support to develop the Elm Street property which former Cincinnati Bengals player turned developer Chinedum Ndukwe envisioned as a hotel and office complex with apartments and a restaurant.

“This was not a single event one-off deal or momentary lapse in judgment” federal prosecutors wrote in his sentencing memo.

“Sittenfeld’s actions were part of a broader strategy to use his position of power within local government and his prospects for higher office to extract financial contributions out of individuals who regularly conducted city business. In doing so Sittenfeld made clear that his support for their city business was tied directly to their contributions to him. This is not faithful public service or even “politics as usual”—this is corruption.”

Sittenfeld’s federal trial attorneys however have repeatedly said that his indictment actually proved he did not commit a “quid pro quo.”

He has always been pro-development they noted contending his actions (raising money for future campaigns) are all perfectly legal and this is typical business conducted by politicians.

Sittenfeld’s lead appellate attorneys are Yaakov Roth and James Burnham.

Burnham is a Washington D.C. attorney considered an expert in federal corruption law because he successfully represented former Virginia Governor Robert F. McDonnell in McDonnell v. United States.

That case was a major challenge to the scope of the Federal corruption laws because the 2016 ruling narrowed the legal definition of public corruption and made it harder for prosecutors to prove that a political official engaged in bribery.

In 2017 then-President Donald Trump appointed Burnham as Special Assistant to the President and Senior Associate Counsel to the President.

Now in Sittenfeld’s appeal Burnham and Roth argue that federal prosecutors didn’t show clear and precise proof of corruption the “quid pro quo.”

If Sittenfeld’s convictions are allowed to stand it would bring “a First Amendment Ice Age” where every politician could face prosecution for fundraising according to his appeal.

“The government engineered a sting to see if (Sittenfeld) would accept a campaign donation in exchange for supporting a local development project. To maximize the sting’s chances of success the FBI approached Sittenfeld through one of his longtime existing donors in connection with a project Sittenfeld had already agreed to support” his appeal states.

“Yet despite the choreography Sittenfeld never bit. Over the course of a year-long prosecutorial Truman Show Sittenfeld rejected the only express quid pro quo his friend offered cautioned him on the legal limits around donations turned away contributions that did not comport with obscure campaign-finance rules and even invited two undercover agents to a dinner party with the U.S. Attorney.”

Several amicus briefs also have been filed in support of Sittenfeld’s appeal

Among them are ones from former U.S. Attorney Generals William Barr and John Ashcroft and the top federal prosecutor for the same government office who prosecuted Sittenfeld Carter Stewart. He was the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio from 2009 to 2016.

Sittenfeld’s case they wrote “has two highly unusual features that render it an extreme outlier among campaign-finance bribery prosecutions. First Mr. Sittenfeld’s conduct did not involve the typical signs of wrongdoing that prosecutors expect to see when a public official is engaged in a corrupt enterprise…

“Second the case resulted from a two-year investigation that involved a sting operation specifically intended to uncover evidence of misconduct…The result was a conviction for conduct that was not criminal.”

PSX,Phillips 66,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpZXJyYWNsdWIub3JnL3NpZXJyYS9ob3ctb25lLXdhc2hpbmd0b24tY291bnR5LXRvb2stZm9zc2lsLWZ1ZWwtaW5kdXN0cnktYW5kLXdvbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How One Washington County Took On the Fossil Fuel Industry—and Won,"On June 10 1999 the Olympic Pipeline ruptured and spilled more than 236000 gallons of gasoline into a creek in the small city of Bellingham Washington. Residents quickly reported suffocating smells coming from the creek which had turned pink from the contamination. An hour and a half later the gasoline that was floating downstream ignited resulting in a massive explosion that killed three people including two 10-year-old boys.

“That was a big wake-up call for our community—Bellingham and Whatcom County—about oil and gas” Carl Weimer remembers.

Weimer went on to become a fierce advocate for pipeline safety and in 2005 he was elected to the Whatcom County Council where he served for 12 years. From that perch he found himself at the center of a series of other fossil fuel battles. Whatcom County—located in the northwest corner of the United States and home to two of Washington State’s five oil refineries—has been bombarded with proposed oil gas and coal projects over the past decade and a half. Endowed with deep-water harbors and crossed by the main rail line going from the United States to British Columbia the county is a natural hub for the movement of commodities.

This summer county leaders finally decided they had enough of constantly batting away fossil fuel projects. In July the Whatcom County Council unanimously voted to amend the county’s Comprehensive Plan and ban the construction of new oil refineries and other fossil fuel infrastructure in their jurisdiction. The ban made international headlines as the vote made Whatcom County the first county in the United States to take such a step. In addition to banning new fossil-fuel-related projects county leaders put in place limits on the expansion of existing facilities like the two oil refineries. Now upgrades at existing facilities will require public notice ending an industry practice of quietly sneaking substantial industrial proposals through the permitting process unbeknownst to nearby communities.

Carl Weimer said some of the seeds of the fossil fuel infrastructure ban were planted in the community efforts that sprung out of the pipeline explosion 22 years ago. “I think that pipeline tragedy kind of set this community up” for action he told Sierra.

One of the most controversial fossil fuel proposals slated for Whatcom County was the Gateway Pacific coal export terminal. First proposed in 2011 the coal port would have been the largest in the country. That “galvanized the community to come together to try to defeat that because it was so wrong in so many different ways” Weimer said.

In addition to the environmental and safety hazards to Whatcom County residents living along the rail route the coal terminal posed a threat to the ancestral fishing waters of the Lummi Nation a violation of the tribe’s treaty-guaranteed fishing rights. After years of legal wrangling the Army Corps of Engineers ultimately agreed killing off the project with a permit rejection in 2016.

Gateway Pacific was not the only coal terminal planned for the Pacific Northwest. As recently as a decade ago a half dozen other coal-by-rail and export terminals were proposed for the region as increasingly cash-strapped coal-mining companies looked to sell their product abroad. A similar dynamic was unfolding in oil markets with oil companies scrambling to find ways to move oil to the Pacific for export to Asia.

That meant that Whatcom County and specifically the industrialized area at Cherry Point on the Salish Sea became a prime target for the fossil fuel industry.

The campaign against the Gateway Pacific project strengthened the efforts by community members environmental groups and Indigenous peoples to transition the county away from fossil fuels. More environmental champions began running for county council in order to challenge the industry.

In 2016 Carl Weimer and others on the county council wanted to find some legal tools they could use to put a stop to future fossil fuel development. But implementing legally defensible restrictions would take time and Weimer feared that oil gas and coal companies might rush through a bunch of projects while the county crafted new restrictions.

“That's when it dawned on us that we needed to pass an emergency moratorium while we worked on these amendments to preclude them from getting something grandfathered in” he said. In 2016 Whatcom County passed a six-month moratorium on new fossil fuel projects at Cherry Point. For the next five years the county renewed the temporary moratorium every six months.

The moratoriums sparked backlash from the oil industry mainly BP and Phillips 66 two large companies that each have a refinery at Cherry Point. They began angling to elect oil allies to Whatcom County leadership as a way to tip the scales in their direction.

The most glaring example came during the 2019 race for county executive in which Phillips 66 poured tens of thousands of dollars into a political action committee (PAC) allied with the industry-friendly candidate Tony Larson. At that time Larson headed the Whatcom Business Alliance an organization that counts the Cherry Point oil refiners among its members. The industry was essentially running one of its own in the county executive race.

Despite the industry-backed PAC’s heavy spending and smearing of the opposition Larson lost to the progressive candidate. Larson’s defeat was the latest in a string of election losses for the oil industry—and the defeat helped clear the way for the county to finally make its fossil fuel moratorium permanent.

The oil industry “spent a lot of money on three election cycles unsuccessfully. Then they came to the table. And that was really helpful” Todd Donovan a Whatcom County councilmember told Sierra. “If that [the 2019 election] had gone the other way industry wouldn't have come on board.”

In July the county council approved the fossil fuel development ban in a 7–0 vote. Even the oil industry supported the outcome by signaling that it would not challenge the new restrictions in court. At the council hearing Tom Wolf BP’s senior government affairs manager for the West Coast called the new restrictions a “sweet spot that Goldilocks zone where not everyone gets what they want but what they need.”

Piercing the industry’s “aura of invincibility” was critical according to Matt Krogh an oil and gas campaigner at Stand.earth an environmental group. For too long fossil fuel companies would come to Whatcom County and not seek input on their plans and instead would simply try to steamroll the community. Opposition felt futile which only enhanced the industry’s position.

The new ban on fossil fuels “entirely flips the script on that and says ‘We're inevitably done with fossil fuel expansion. We're going in a different direction’” Krogh said. “To me that is the most inspiring part of it all.”

Even with public opinion firmly on their side the county council also wanted to make sure that its new ordinance could withstand legal attacks. The county funded an extensive legal study ahead of time to establish a solid foundation for what it could do ensuring that whatever infrastructure ban it put into place wouldn’t be quickly overturned in court.

“We couldn't regulate oil trains because that's interstate commerce” Weimer said “but we could regulate what the industries could build on their sites to facilitate the oil trains so we went in that direction.”

Carefully crafting the legal scope of the infrastructure ban proved critical. “Without the multiple electoral victories without the legal study I think negotiating with industry would be problematic” Krogh said.

There is little evidence to suggest that the global oil and gas industry will go quietly into the night. In the absence of coordinated federal action to keep fossil fuels in the ground localized bans on fossil fuel infrastructure may become an important tool for communities eager to accelerate the transition to a renewable energy economy.

“We didn't have any hope that the federal government was going to protect us. So we had to try to do what we could locally” Weimer said.

“I think often local governments underestimate how much power they have. This was certainly an experiment in that” he said. “How far could we push it?

You need JavaScript enabled to view it.

Diocese of Lake Charles

As the saying goes: One good deed deserves another especially when it comes to disaster relief between two dioceses affected by Category 4 hurricanes one year apart.

Before Hurricane Ida devastated the Diocese of Houma-Thibodaux on Aug. 29 much like Laura did to the Diocese of Lake Charles on Aug. 27 2020 parishioners at St. Pius X Catholic Church in Ragley were texting and calling Father Jeffrey Starkovich asking “Are any of your friends who came to help us going to be affected by the storm? We want to help them the way they came to help us.”

Father Andre Melancon left pastor of St. Bernadette

Catholic Church in Houma; and Father Jeffrey Starkovich

pastor of St. Pius X Catholic Church in Ragley belong

to the same priest support group. They helped each other

out in the aftermath of Category 4 hurricanes in both

of their dioceses — Hurricane Ida recently (Aug. 29) in the

Diocese of Houma-Thibodaux and Hurricane Laura

a year ago (Aug. 27 2020) in the Diocese of Lake Charles.

Those friends belong to the same priest support group with Father Starkovich pastor of St. Pius and get together monthly for fellowship and spiritual nourishment. Within days after Hurricane Laura their parishes from the Archdiocese of New Orleans and the Dioceses of Houma-Thibodaux Lafayette and Baton Rouge drove to Ragley to bring supplies cook meals in the parking lot and clean up the church property.

“That was a wonderful experience to have my close priest friends eight in all from my support group coming to help us out” recalled Father Starkovich. “As Hurricane Ida was approaching we were checking in with each other making sure everyone was okay. My friend Father Andre Melancon and his parish St. Bernadette Catholic Church in downtown Houma were among those who had assisted us several times.”

St. Pius parishioners didn’t waste any time after Ida’s landfall heading to St. Bernadette with chainsaws and equipment to clean up around the church.

“Everyone knows how much we benefitted from the support of surrounding parishes and dioceses. Our goal was to meet the emergency of our neighbors to the east. We couldn’t wait. We had to get them stable and safe” said Father Starkovich. “Just this Christian charity saying ‘now let’s go help them.’ That’s the beauty.”

Volunteers from St. Pius X Catholic Church in Ragley distribute

supplies in the parking lot of St. Bernadette Catholic Church

in Houma to those affected by Hurricane Ida. A year ago parishioners

from St. Bernadette made several trips to St. Pius in the days

and weeks following Hurricane Laura.

Catholic Charities of Southwest Louisiana led by Sister Miriam MacLean R.S.M. was also ready to spring into action. For the first trip on Aug. 31 Sister Miriam was joined by Father Starkovich Father Joseph Caraway parochial vicar at St. Henry Catholic Church; and Sydney Thomas who coordinates disaster recovery at Catholic Charities. They loaded “Big Joe” — a 26-foot truck — with bottled water tarps and basic supplies and caravanned to Houma along with Catholic Charities of Acadiana.

“All the Catholic Charities in the state have very strong relationships with one another” said Sister Miriam. “Before the storm came we had been in communication with each other. Once it became evident that it was going to hit southeast Louisiana the conversation shifted to what do you need?”

The day after Hurricane Ida’s landfall Catholic Charities offered 900 meals donated by Phillips 66 for evacuees staying in the Lake Charles area.

Looking back to last year Sister Miriam said that God allowed things to happen in the Diocese of Lake Charles with back-to-back hurricanes while at the same time preparing her to help other dioceses. She and her team shared first-hand experiences providing immense resources to Bishop Shelton Fabre and his diocesan leadership of Houma-Thibodaux to assist with their own recovery.

“Part of the reason we always had what we needed after Hurricane Laura was because other people knew from their experiences what we needed and they just brought it before we could even anticipate we needed something” Sister Miriam said. “It’s like a bond that only those who have been through a similar experience can share.”

Nearly 50 volunteers from St. Pius X Catholic Church in Ragley

ranging in ages from elementary school to retired assisted

with Hurricane Ida relief efforts at St. Bernadette Catholic Church

in the Diocese of Houma-Thibodaux on Saturday Sept. 4

of Labor Day weekend.

The Saturday of Labor Day weekend Father Starkovich made another trip to St. Bernadette with nearly 50 volunteers from St. Pius X Parish. They cooked 400 plates of jambalaya brought 300 gallons of gasoline and another truckload of water and supplies on “Big Joe.”

Father Starkovich said he was amazed at the interest shown by the youth as young as elementary age and middle school students getting involved with their families.

“It’s beautiful to see entire families loading cars talking to people praying with people. The faith of the people in Louisiana is very much at the heart of their generous response” said Father Starkovich. “We have received blessings from the people who helped us and now we have the opportunity to help them too.”

Pairing Parishes Together

After St. Bernadette Parish was stabilized St. Pius partnered with two other parishes to make sure the rural areas have what they need.

Father Andrew DeRouen parochial vicar at St. Pius and St. Theodore organized “Pairing Parishes Together” to work with priests in the dioceses impacted by Ida. While participation is optional the idea is for priests throughout Louisiana to adopt one parish from the list.

“Response from the pastors has been wonderful” said Father Starkovich “making sure all the affected parishes have what they need. Parishioners of each partner parish can stay in contact with each other and do mission trips to bring supplies work crews or cook meals.”

In addition to St. Pius X parishes in the Diocese of Lake Charles participating are Christ the King Our Lady Queen of Heaven St. Henry the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception St. Martin de Porres and Sacred Heart of Jesus all in Lake Charles; Our Lady Help of Christians and Immaculate Conception both in Jennings; St. Theodore in Moss Bluff; Our Lady of Prompt Succor and Our Lady of LaSalette both in Sulphur; and St. Joseph in Vinton.

“I know God is bringing something good out of these enormous struggles” said Father Starkovich. “Somehow in God’s mysterious way we are going to see some very beautiful things. I have already seen the generosity and service people are doing. We will continue to hope pray work together and trust in the Lord. Whatever God has in store is what’s best for us.”

Special Collection for Hurricane Ida Relief

The weekend of Oct. 2 and 3 the Diocese of Lake Charles will be taking up a special collection for Hurricane Ida Relief during all Masses. The funds collected will benefit relief efforts in the Dioceses of Houma-Thibodaux and Baton Rouge and the Archdiocese of New Orleans. The money will be distributed proportionately according to the needs of each diocese. All three contributed generously to the Diocese of Lake Charles following Hurricanes Laura and Delta. Please give as generously as you are able in your parish and pray for the victims and those engaged in disaster relief.",,,

The NFL is expected to ask for US$2 billion to US$2.5 billion per year for the package and wants to wrap up discussions before the season ends in February two of the people said. “Sunday Ticket” has been owned by DirecTV for the past 27 years. Talks are progressing with interested parties suggesting the league is getting closer to choosing a new provider said the people.

The “Sunday Ticket” service allows NFL fans to watch a wide variety of football games outside of their local markets. The move would help boost Amazon’s live sports offerings on its streaming service.

FL Commissioner Roger Goodell told CNBC on Wednesday September 8 the out-of-market Sunday game package “maybe will be more attractive on a digital platform” as streaming platforms continue to add subscribers at the expense of traditional pay-television. Goodell also suggested to CNBC that the league is looking for one strategic partner to acquire not only “Sunday Ticket” rights but to also invest in NFL Network which airs NFL content all year and NFL RedZone which shows live footage of game action when teams are close to scoring touchdowns. The NFL currently owns both NFL Network and NFL RedZone.

Earlier in May NFL stated it had moved up the date for Amazon’s Prime video to exclusively stream Thursday Night Football beginning with the 2022 season.

In 1984 Saunders made her start as a teller at the now-closed Equitable Savings while she worked toward her political science degree from Ohio State University. She didn’t expect to fall in love with banking she says and to her father’s surprise she would not go on to become the first woman attorney general (she has no hard feelings toward Janet Reno though).

Saunders knew she had a love for talking with people and listening but she didn’t fully understand the potential those values had in banking until she traveled to Chicago for her work with Household Bank.

“Being in a position where you could help people really meet their financial goals and dreams was something that really excited me” Saunders says.

Saunders went on to work at Huntington Bank for nearly a decade and PNC Bank where she served as senior vice president before becoming FCBank’s third president four years ago.

With headquarters in Worthington FCBank is a division of Clearfield Pennsylvania-based CNB Bank and has six locations in the Columbus region.

Under Saunders’ leadership some big changes have come to pass. Most recently FCBank’s Grandview Heights-area branch celebrated its grand reopening just a year after its grand opening in August 2020. Due to COVID-19 the bank’s lobbies have remained closed until recently.

The West Fifth Avenue branch is unique for its “Smart Financial Center” model Saunders says. Instead of the standard teller lines it features round tables and chairs a “living room” with a couch and various areas to sit and talk. The focus is on interpersonal communication and relationship-building not just a transaction.

Also included is the enhanced teller machine or ETM which allows customers to talk with a banker through an interactive video before during and after traditional banking hours. The Grandview model is replicated in the bank’s Bucyrus branch and one day will be in all its locations Saunders says.

FCBank plans to open a seventh branch in Westerville in 2022 in the former Flowerama space on South State Street marking the bank’s third branch with the new design.

Saunders and her team are also working on a mobile banking model which will allow FCBank to travel to underbanked areas and a “Fresh Start” checking account designed to help those with low to moderate incomes.

“We are committed to those communities both from a financial perspective and a time perspective” Saunders says.

This could be as good as it gets on Wall Street.

Amanda Agati chief investment officer at PNC Financial Services Group says the signs point to ""peak growth"" right now.

""We're seeing it in a number of economic indicators that we continue to track"" Agati told CNBC's ""Trading Nation"" on Friday.

She lists four reasons why. The first inflation — producer prices in August rose by 8.3% on a year-over-year basis a record annual increase. Agati says this red-hot pace will likely prove transitory but rising prices are here to stay.

Agati also points to economic data such as GDP growth and manufacturing numbers that could be revised lower; sentiment indicators such as the University of Michigan consumer sentiment index which has not returned to pre-pandemic levels; and earnings growth estimates that may also be rerated.

""When we look at all of these together they're all converging around this similar theme of 'at peak' or 'near peak' or 'passing the peak' in terms of growth"" Agati said.

This does not mean there's reason to panic and it does not warrant major changes to how investors allocate funds she said.

""It really is more of a 'slow your roll' environment in that we have been on such a torrid pace in terms of this market rally off the bottoms of the pandemic last year"" she said. ""This is much more of a resetting of investor expectations about what the path forward may hold.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZHljYXIuY29tL05ld3MvMjAyMS8wOS8wOS0xMS1Qb3J0bGFuZC1RdWFsaWZ5aW5n0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Palou Powers to First Career Pole Pivotal Point at Portland,"Results: Qualifying | Final Practice Watch: Qualifying Highlights

Alex Palou rebounded from a disappointing stretch of recent results by winning the NTT P1 Award for the Grand Prix of Portland on Saturday at Portland International Raceway.

Palou earned his first career NTT INDYCAR SERIES pole with a top lap of 58.7701 seconds in the No. 10 PNC Bank Honda putting the finishing touches on a dominant Saturday under sunny skies and 70-degree temperatures in the Pacific Northwest. He led the second qualifying session was second quickest in his first qualifying group and led morning practice.

“I’m super happy with my first pole in INDYCAR” Palou said. “We’re starting on the best position tomorrow and we know we have a really fast car. I cannot wait for tomorrow’s race.”

The 110-lap race on the 12-turn 1.964-mile road course starts at 3 p.m. (ET) Sunday live on NBC and the INDYCAR Radio Network.

Spaniard Palou will earn one point for the pole valuable as he entered this event 10 points behind championship leader Pato O’Ward. Palou started on pole for the Genesys 300 in early May at Texas Motor Speedway but qualifying for that event was canceled due to weather delays with the starting lineup set by entrant points.

The strong performance at Portland was a powerful rebound from Palou’s two worst finishes of the season in the last two races 27th at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway road course with a mechanical problem and 20th at World Wide Technology Raceway after being taken out in a crash.

“This motivates us but we were already fully motivated” Palou said. “We all know that the last two race weekends we had it was out of our control. So we’re fully laser-focused on these three races we have to get that championship home and we’ll try to get that.”

Alexander Rossi will join Palou on the front row after qualifying second at 58.8573 in the No. 27 NAPA AUTO PARTS/AutoNation Honda tying his best starting position of the season.

The second row consists of title contender and six-time series champion Scott Dixon in third with a best lap of 58.8673 in the No. 9 PNC Bank Grow Up Great Honda and Felix Rosenqvist fourth at 58.9505 in the No. 7 Arrow McLaren SP Chevrolet.

Graham Rahal qualified a season-best fifth at 59.0067 in the No. 15 Total Quartz Honda. Colton Herta rounded out the Firestone Fast Six at 59.2796 as his gamble of being the only driver in the Fast Six to use Firestone primary “black” tires instead of alternate “red” tires didn’t pay off.

The pole position was even more valuable for Palou than the bonus point. Dixon was the only other one of the five drivers in contention for the 2021 championship to advance to the Firestone Fast Six. That could give Palou some breathing room on the PIR circuit where passing opportunities aren’t plentiful and the tight Turn 1 chicane is a flashpoint for potential collisions at the start and on restarts for cars in a thicket of traffic.

Championship leader O’Ward qualified seventh in the No. 5 Arrow McLaren SP Chevrolet after being eliminated by teammate Rosenqvist by .0103 of a second on the last lap of the second qualifying session. Marcus Ericsson 60 points behind O’Ward in fifth qualified 10th in the No. 8 Huski Chocolate Chip Ganassi Racing Honda.

Two-time series champion Josef Newgarden 22 points behind O’Ward in third will start 18th in the 27-car field in the No. 2 Hitachi Team Penske Chevrolet.

Newgarden’s qualifying troubles were a symptom of larger woes for Team Penske. All four Penske drivers – Newgarden 2019 Portland winner Will Power Simon Pagenaud and rookie Scott McLaughlin – were eliminated in the first round of road or street course qualifying for the first time this season.

British driver Callum Ilott qualified 19th for his NTT INDYCAR SERIES debut in the No. 77 Juncos Hollinger Racing Chevrolet. Ferrari Formula One test driver Ilott was the second-quickest of the four series rookies in the field behind only McLaughlin who qualified 15th in the No. 3 PPG Team Penske Chevrolet.

Dixon led final practice with a lap of 59.4111. Newgarden rebounded to second at 59.6296 in the 30-minute session.",,,,,,

But as Brooklyn’s former Bedford Union Armory readies to reopen in the coming weeks as the Major R. Owens Health and Wellness Community Center early signs show sky-high prices at its swimming pool.

Imagine Swimming the outfit set to teach swimming at the competition-length pool is advertising 30-minute lessons for $50 each on top of a $50 registration fee for a group class of up to four. That’s the same rate Imagine offers for lessons at its two flagship locations in Manhattan’s Tribeca and Upper West Side.

THE CITY found 30-minute lessons for as little as $30 in other parts of Brooklyn.

“Fifty dollars for 30 minutes is very steep especially for low-income families…. I can’t afford that” said Tashawna Hylton 40 who said she’d like to sign up her 9-year-old son.

Imagine’s prices go up to $100 per half-hour for a semi-private class with two kids and $200 for a private session accoring to the company’s website.

Imagine’s website lays out lesson options.

The nonprofit facility operator brought in by developer BFC Partners The Boys’ Club of New York promotes $5 annual memberships for young men at its community centers in East Harlem and Flushing Queens including swimming lessons.

The group has not yet announced membership rates for the new armory pool and gym facilities and did not follow through on a scheduled interview with THE CITY to discuss the plan.

Some local school kids will be offered swim lessons at a steep discount says Imagine though details are still not available.

Affordable young people’s swimming lessons have become a scarce commodity following the second summer in a row in which the city’s Department of Parks and Recreation has cancelled its free summer learn-to-swim programs at public pools due to COVID cuts.

Local Crown Heights parents say the advertised price will prevent them from enrolling their children in classes at the Bedford Avenue armory.

Joel Mead 38 said he never bought the promise that redeveloping the 118-year-old armory would benefit his majority Black working-class neighborhood.

“When they say they’re gonna give us something it’s always questionable” said Mead whose 10-year-old son wants to learn how to swim. “Nobody really believes it.”

‘Truly Affordable and Accessible’

When City Councilmember Laurie Cumbo voted in favor of the 2017 armory redevelopment deal she received backlash from local activists who argued the project would accelerate the displacement of longtime residents.

At the time Cumbo promised use of the recreation center would be within financial reach for local families. She “negotiated several requirements to ensure that the state-of-the-art recreation center at the Armory will be truly affordable and accessible to Crown Heights families” reads a press release issued by her office.

Cumbo told THE CITY that shifting COVID guidelines are making the logistics of opening and operating the center “highly complicated.” But she promised that community discounts that “coincide and connect” with safety protocols will be available when the doors open.

A spokesperson for the BFC Partners didn’t specify a debut date but said plans are underway for a “soft opening” this month.

“We are wrapping up construction and tenants are currently moving in as we finalize preparations” said the spokesperson Matthew Costantini. “Our plan is to schedule a larger-scaled community ceremony next month.”

A spokesperson for the city Economic Development Corp. which leased the city property to BFC Partners for 99 years said an agreement with the developer “incentivized community benefits especially for our youth.”

Also part of the deal: requiring “hundreds of affordable housing and mixed-income apartments” and “extensive community engagement on the project.”

BFC Partners didn’t answer questions regarding any affordability commitments in its agreement with EDC nor did it address inquiries about local community memberships.

“There will be information sessions and more specifics to the memberships affordability and programming coming soon” Costantini said.

Serving Up Scholarships

Brenden O’Melveny Imagine’s chief aquatics officer said that while discounts are not currently advertised the swimming company is hatching a “scholarship” program for children who attend nearby schools where the majority of students come from low-income families.

“We’re going to partner with District 17 Title 1 schools and have set up a system where they’ll be referring families to us to participate in our after-school lessons” O’Melveny said noting the mechanics of the system haven’t been nailed down yet. “And we may look into other other avenues as well but we’re going to see how that one goes first.”

Scholarship recipients will receive an 80% discount from Imagine’s market rate dropping the cost of a 30-minute lesson to $10 per child O’Melveny said. But it was unclear how many scholarships would be provided.

“We’re still working to figure out how to implement the community benefits side of things and I think we’re getting close to that now” he said. “We just didn’t want to release information if we didn’t have all the details sorted out.”

He said on Thursday Imagine hopes to release additional details “within the next week or so.”

O’Melveny told THE CITY the pool is expected to open Sept. 20.

October Grand Opening

EDC said it’s aiming for a highly visible debut next month.

“A grand opening event will be held in October to help get the word out to the community about the affordable and accessible programs and services made available at” the center said Helen Jonsen an EDC spokesperson.

The 60000-square-foot center is set to house three basketball courts a multi-use field indoor swimming pool fitness center and space for boxing and archery. Local nonprofits including Ifetayo Cultural Arts Academy Digital Girl Inc. and Brooklyn Community Pride Center are set to occupy office spaces within the building.

In addition to Boys’ Club of New York which is serving as the center’s recreational operator BFC hired Globall Sports to oversee the multi-use field while New Heights Youth will be responsible for basketball courts.

Mead said if his son doesn’t get discounted swim lessons he may wind up paying full-price and “just skipping lunch for the next two weeks.” He added that swimming is an important “survival skill” one that he’s determined to afford his child.

“Most minorities don’t know how to swim” Mead said. “It’s sad because we don’t have access.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvYnJldHRvd2Vucy8yMDIxLzA5LzEyLzUtZGl2aWRlbmQtZ3Jvd3RoLXN0b2Nrcy10by1idXktbm93L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,5 Dividend Growth Stocks To Buy Now,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettowens/2021/09/12/5-dividend-growth-stocks-to-buy-now/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvYnJldHRvd2Vucy8yMDIxLzA5LzEyLzUtZGl2aWRlbmQtZ3Jvd3RoLXN0b2Nrcy10by1idXktbm93L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

Hurricane Ida's damage will pile on to an already overwhelmed supply chain.

The storm temporarily shut down several ports. Recovery efforts will also strain the trucking industry.

The storm will impact the availability of products from oil to food electronics toys and furniture.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

The aftermath of Hurricane Ida will only pile onto the multitude of supply chain issues.

The storm wreaked havoc across the Gulf Coast and East Coast last month killing at least 40 people and causing tornadoes and historic flooding. Current estimates place the damage from Ida at over $95 billion.

The fallout is far from over. From increased shipping delays and shortages to pushing prices even higher Insider spoke with five supply chain experts that broke down the impact the hurricane will have on the ongoing supply chain crisis.

""Every additional hit is amplified"" Gad Allon Director of University of Pennsylvania's Jerome Fisher Program in Management & Technology told Insider. ""All supply chains are so strained that Ida could have a bigger long term impact than Hurricane Katrina.""

Since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic a boom in demand has overwhelmed the supply chain. Transportation has struggled to keep up as rising demand met COVID-19 shutdowns causing shortages of shipping containers and price hikes. Judah Levine the Head of Research at Freightos told Insider shipping prices between Asia and the US have hit a new record jumping 500% from this time last year.

Hurricane Ida caused damage at several US ports

Hurricane Ida forced the Port of New Orleans to close for several days. While the port was since able to reopen others including Port of South Louisiana and Port Fourchon sustained damage.

Chris Tomas the Lead Intelligence Analyst at BSI told Insider port delays could impact grain and oil shipments though the ports are only responsible for a fraction of US imports. But the damage and temporary closures in Louisiana come at the same time as key ports in Southern California are facing record backlogs.

Hurricane Ida has had the most significant impact on US oil production

The storm's 150 miles-per-hour winds in the Gulf of Mexico cut most offshore oil and gas production for over a week while also damaging onshore support facilities and causing some of the oil to leak into the Gulf. Reuters reported that the oil losses ranked among the worst in 16 years. Today the aftermath of the storm has kept about 12% of US oil production at a standstill The New York Times reported.

The disruption in oil flow will have a reverberating impact on many US industries Douglas Kent the Executive Vice President of Strategy and Alliances at the Association for Supply Chain Management (ASCM) told Insider.

""Constraints on one raw material compound themselves across the industry"" Kent said pointing to companies like paint and specialty coatings giant PPG Industries. Earlier this week the company warned raw materials costs would rise due to Hurricane Ida.

Shipping concerns are minor compared to the impact on ground transportation

Trucking companies will be responsible for bringing in new supplies to areas recovering from the storm.

""The trucking industry already has two major issues: long port delays as well as a labor shortage"" Allon said. ""Now we're triple-straining the systems by requiring them to go into areas that will be difficult to access where they will be bogged down.""







Kent warned the supply chain issues will continue to felt by customers both through a lack of supply of imported items like electronics toys and furniture as well as price hikes.

""When we see these massive increases in transportation costs it's clear somebody will have to pay for it"" Kent said. ""One more disruption could send it [the global supply chain] into complete chaos.""

Experts have warned that the supply chain crisis will continue into 2023.",,,,,,,,,

New Delhi: Capital markets regulator Sebi has put in place certification requirements for associated persons engaged by portfolio managers as distributors or employees having decision-making authority related to fund management. These persons need to obtain certification from the National Institute of Securities Markets (NISM) the regulator said in two separate notifications dated September 7.The associated persons engaged by a portfolio manager as a distributor of the PMS  and associated persons functioning as principal officers of a portfolio manager or an employee having decision-making authority related to fund management will have to obtain certification from the NISM by passing the certification examination.The portfolio managers will have to ensure that that all associated persons who are distributors of the portfolio management services (PMS) and who are principal officers having decision-making authority related to fund management as of September 7 2021 obtain the certification within two years Sebi said.It further said a portfolio manager who engage or employ such associated person after September 7 2021 will have to ensure that such person obtains certification within one year from the date of their employment.However an associated person who being a distributor of the PMS has obtained a valid AMFI Registration Number (ARN) or NISM certification will be exempted from the requirement of obtaining such certification.Earlier in March the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) notified new regulations for portfolio managers about their qualifications.The move was expected to help recognise ""the postgraduate programme in the securities market of not less than one year offered by NISM"" as an eligible qualification for portfolio managers.With regard to qualification for the portfolio manager Sebi had said a portfolio manager needs to have a professional qualification in finance law accountancy or business management from a university or an institution recognised by a recognised university or a professional qualification by completing a postgraduate programme in the securities market (portfolio management) from NISM.The postgraduate programme from NISM should not be less than a one-year duration.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzZGFpbHkuZ3IvZW5nbGlzaC1lZGl0aW9uLzQ4OTgwX2F1c3RyYWxpYXMtbWFjcXVhcmllLWJ1eS1oZWRuby1ncmVlY2VzLWxhcmdlc3QtcHJpdmF0aXNhdGlvbtIBc2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzZGFpbHkuZ3IvZW5nbGlzaC1lZGl0aW9uLzQ4OTgwX2F1c3RyYWxpYXMtbWFjcXVhcmllLWJ1eS1oZWRuby1ncmVlY2VzLWxhcmdlc3QtcHJpdmF0aXNhdGlvbj9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Australia's Macquarie to buy HEDNO in Greece's largest privatisation,,,,,,,,,,

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks including The Procter & Gamble Company (PG) Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) and Intuitive Surgical Inc. (ISRG). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.



You can see all of today’s research reports here >>>



Procter & Gamble’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry over the past year (+9.9% vs. +8.3%). The company has been gaining from robust pricing and a favorable mix along with strength across segments.



Procter & Gamble has been focused on productivity and cost-saving plans to boost margins. This led to bottom line beating the consensus mark for the seventh consecutive quarter in third-quarter fiscal 2024. Consequently PG has provided an optimistic fiscal 2024 view.



However the company has been witnessing supply-chain issues higher SG&A costs higher transportation costs and rising inflation. Its significant international presence exposes it to foreign currency risks which acts as a headwind.

Shares Verizon of have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the past year (+12.8% vs. +11.7%). The company has reported modest first-quarter results with the bottom line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line missing the same. The deployment of a cloud-native container-based virtualized architecture has led to increased flexibility scalability and cost efficiency across its network.



Verizon is offering various mix and match pricing in both wireless and home broadband plans which has led to solid client additions. Focus on emerging growth services like cloud security and professional services will likely reap long-term benefits.



However lower wireline and wireless equipment revenues are major concerns. Huge promotional expenses and lucrative discounts to expand customer base are weighing on margins. High capital expenditure for continuous network upgrade and fiber deployment is a headwind. A muted guidance for 2024 is worrisome.



(You can read the full research report on Verizon here >>>)



Intuitive Surgical’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry over the past year (+25.7% vs. +4.0%). The company ended the first quarter on a positive note beating estimates on both counts. Revenues improved year over year. The strong performance is likely to continue in 2024 on the back of continued growth in the company’s da Vinci procedure volume coupled with strong Ion procedure growth.



ISRG’s initiative to increase the pricing of procedures should also continue to aid in sales growth in 2024.Improving procedure volume along with better system placements and services across all markets will drive top-line growth this year. Launch of da Vinci SP in Europe and da Vinci 5 in U.S. market should drive system placements higher.



However ongoing supply chain constraints although easing are likely to hurt the availability of devices. Labor shortage in hospitals will likely act as a headwind to procedure growth in 2024.

Journalist Alan Macleod pointed out that ""Chile would be ruled by a gruesome fascist dictatorship for decades the scars of which are still very fresh.""

""But people in the West"" MacLeod argued ""are largely insulated from the realities of empire thanks to a pliant media which never shows you the effect of the bombs sanctions coups etc.""

Progressive International noted that ""Allende was elected Chile's first socialist president in 1970 as the candidate of Popular Unity a socialist-communist coalition. He quickly went to work reorganizing the society he inherited characterized by poverty and confined by the greed of international corporations.""

The organization highlighted some of what the Popular Unity government accomplished during its three years in power:

The Allende government nationalized Chile's foreign-owned copper industry which was responsible for 75% of exports. Rather than compensate the former owners Allende sought payment for the unfairly extracted resource. He did not stop with copper. In its first year the government nationalized 91 industries redistributed 5.5 [million] acres of land granted wage rises to the working class and built quality homes for the poor. Allende hoped to build a sovereign developed democratic and humane nation--and one whose foreign policy was built on principles of friendship.

The democratic socialist alternative pursued in Chile however ""was intolerable to the forces of empire"" Progressive International added. ""Fearing that Allende would set a good example for other nations to follow U.S. President Richard Nixon ordered the Central Intelligence Agency to 'make the economy scream'"" in an effort to bring down the Popular Unity government.

Other rich and powerful countries also worked to sabotage the Allende administration. As The Guardian reported Friday declassified government documents verify how the Australian Secret Intelligence Service opened a base in Santiago in 1971 and conducted covert operations alongside the U.S. CIA for 18 months contributing to the destabilization of Chile's economy that preceded Pinochet's violent overthrow of Popular Unity.

As his offices were being bombarded on September 11 Allende gave his last speech. MacLeod on Saturday shared a clip from John Pilger's 2007 documentary The War on Democracy showcasing the former Chilean president's ""final words broadcast to the nation.""

""At this definitive moment the last moment when I can address you I wish you to take advantage of the lesson: foreign capital imperialism together with the reaction created the climate in which the armed forces broke their tradition... victims of the same social sector who today are hoping with foreign assistance to reconquer the power to continue defending their profits and their privileges"" said Allende.

""Workers of my country I have faith in Chile and its destiny"" Allende continued. ""Other men will overcome this dark and bitter moment when treason seeks to prevail. Go forward knowing that sooner rather than later the great avenues will open again and free men will walk through them to construct a better society.""

""Long live Chile! Long live the people! Long live the workers!"" he added. ""These are my last words and I am certain that my sacrifice will not be in vain.""

If recent events in Chile are any indication it would appear that Allende's sacrifice was not made in vain.

Last October as Common Dreams reported Chileans voted in a 4-to-1 landslide to rewrite the country's right-wing constitution which was implemented under anti-democratic conditions in 1980 with long-lasting negative repurcussions.

While there have been attempts to curb market fundamentalism in Chile since the post-dictatorship period began in 1990 the neoliberal constitution crafted during the Pinochet era has continued to exacerbate inequalities and put up barriers to egalitarian reform long after the murderous dictator's demise.

Progressives worldwide rejoiced as the nation once deemed the ""laboratory"" of neoliberalism--where University of Chicago-trained economists experimented with widespread privatization on an unwilling population--had through a massive popular rebellion against years of austerity created an opportunity to ""bury Pinochet's legacy... and rebuild the country on a truly democratic basis"" as political theorist Melany Cruz put it at the time.

Following last year's historic referendum--the product of a decades-long revolt against the denial of guaranteed access to public goods such as water education healthcare pensions and other necessities--Chileans earlier this year took another major step toward defeating Pinochetismo once and for all.

As Common Dreams reported Chilean voters in May elected a progressive slate of delegates to the constituent assembly tasked with rewriting Pinochet's constitution.

A large majority of the 155 delegates responsible for reshaping the nation's political framework over the next several months are expected to bring progressive perspectives rather than pro-corporate orthodoxy to the table giving Chileans--who will be asked next year in another national referendum whether they accept the new constitution--a real shot to turn neoliberalism's birthplace into its graveyard.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvY2hyaXN0b3BoZXJlbGxpb3R0LzIwMjEvMDkvMTEveW91LWNhbi1zYXZlLW1vbmV5LXdpdGgtdXNhZ2UtYmFzZWQtYXV0by1pbnN1cmFuY2UtLS1idXQtc2hvdWxkLXlvdS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,You Can Save Money With Usage-Based Auto Insurance — But Should You?,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherelliott/2021/09/11/you-can-save-money-with-usage-based-auto-insurance---but-should-you/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvY2hyaXN0b3BoZXJlbGxpb3R0LzIwMjEvMDkvMTEveW91LWNhbi1zYXZlLW1vbmV5LXdpdGgtdXNhZ2UtYmFzZWQtYXV0by1pbnN1cmFuY2UtLS1idXQtc2hvdWxkLXlvdS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuaW1lc2VucGFpLm5ldC9zd29yZC1hcnQtb25saW5lLXByb2dyZXNzaXZlLXJlbGVhc2UtZGF0ZS10cmFpbGVyLWNhc3Qv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sword Art Online Progressive Release Date Trailer & Cast,Stay updated with the latest anime and manga developments by following us on Google News!,,,,,,

Devon Self Storage a business with roots stretching back to 1983 has announced plans of filling the hulking building Kmart vacated in early 2020 at 4100 52nd St.

Company representatives went before the Kenosha Plan Commission on Thursday and received approval for the plans at the initial hearing. A second and final hearing is expecting to take place in October before commissioners give a final vote to the plans.

While the existing building will remain company representatives have pledged major modifications to the exterior of the 1970s-era structure as well as sizable landscaping enhancements designed to break up the sprawling asphalt that has made up the parking lot.

According to details submitted to city officials Devon plans to house 848 storage units within the climate-controlled facility. The company plans a drive-through feature for customers looking to load or unload items at different access points on the property.

“We feel that this is a good location for our operation” said Greg Mackay vice president of acquisitions with Devon. “We’re looking to be long-term neighbors. We’re not here for a quick flip.”

Plans announced in April

In April the prospect of converting the former Kmart into a self-storage facility first surfaced. At the time an affiliate of Hoffman Estates Ill.-based Transformco — the company that bought Kmart and sibling retailer Sears out of bankruptcy in 2019 — submitted a revised certified survey map for the entire property.

TF Kenosha LLC the Transformco affiliate has indicated it is in the process of selling the former Kmart building to Oak Brook Ill.-based Inland Real Estate Acquisitions.

Echoing comments first aired in April commissioners questioned the rationale of opening a self-storage facility at the Kmart site when a similar business from UHaul operates out of the former Walmart to the west.

Mackay however said Devon would complement — not compete — with the nearby U-Haul. He said the two companies target different customers with U-Haul geared more toward truck and trailer drivers and Devon serving personal homeowners.

“We’re not necessarily comparing apples to apples” Mackay said. “We’re well capitalized. We’re willing to come in here and be good neighbors.”

Speaking to pandemic-era changes that prompted homeowners to convert rooms into dedicated workspaces and seeking another means of storing items Mackay said “Our industry has kind of flourished because of COVID.”

Auto center eyed for Blockbuster site

In other business Thursday the Plan Commission gave tentative approval to the planned conversion of the former Blockbuster Video building at 4728 75th St. into a used auto dealership.

RAP Properties Auto Sales has submitted application materials to the city for the change which includes façade changes to the exterior of the building.

Commissioners could issue a final vote on the plans at a meeting in October when a second public hearing is held.

The 50-foot sculpture north of Sunrise Highway has been vandalized and damaged by the elements over the years most recently sustaining significant destruction in an August 2020 storm that ripped off sheaths of stucco covering.

Dr. Harvey Manes a Lindenhurst orthopedist who gives money to charity through his Manes American Peace Prize Foundation presented a $100000 check for the restoration at a small reception at the Stargazer site on Sunday. A part-time South Fork resident Manes said he wanted to preserve the sculpture which for many is an unofficial welcome sign to the East End.

""I have a house in Westhampton. When I saw Stargazer I knew I was almost there"" Manes said. ""It was a landmark an icon. It is the gatekeeper to the Hamptons.""

The sculpture was built by the late artist Linda Scott for the Animal Rescue Fund of the Hamptons in East Hampton. Officials there would not allow the nearly 50-foot sculpture for fear it would interfere with the town-owned airport. Instead it was situated on a Manorville sod farm where since 1991 it has greeted East End travelers who pass it while leaving the Long Island Expressway and getting on to Sunrise Highway.

Scott died in 2015 at the age of 77 but her partner and collaborator David Morris has acted as the sculpture’s steward ever since.

Morris said the work to restore the sculpture will begin in about two weeks. The money will fund materials and labor costs although Morris will perform some work himself including tracing the sculpture onto plywood. Other costs include insurance and rent on the one-acre parcel.

""I was worried we wouldn’t have the funding but here it comes"" Morris said. ""It’s like a miracle.""

The sculpture is purposely abstract Morris said but a spectator can clearly see it is a deer with an antler in its mouth. It represents the shedding of one’s former self he said.

The Greenpoint Brooklyn nonprofit Arete Living Arts Foundation is handling donations. The Flag Art Foundation a Manhattan contemporary art organization will donate $50000 and more than $11000 has been raised through a GoFundMe campaign according to Arete’s executive director Ceasar Pink.

The generosity of donors makes art like this visible to all without barriers possible Pink said.

""Linda believed this sculpture symbolized the connection between humanity and the universe"" he said. ""Without people like Harvey ... public art would not be available.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pbmd0aWFuZGkuY29tL3JlYWwtZXN0YXRlL2NyZWxpc3QvbW9yZ2FuLXN0YW5sZXktcmFpc2VzLTMtMWItZm9yLWdsb2JhbC1mdW5kL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Morgan Stanley Raises $3.1B for Global Fund,"

The Taiwanese firm surprised everyone with its wide offer of good mid-range chips offering 5G connectivity. Last year MediaTek already had 5G chips for most of the price segments while Qualcomm focused on the premium and mid-range segments. This year MediaTek took the crown as the largest chipmaker in the world but Qualcomm wants to reconquer its top position. According to a fresh report the company will enhance its portfolio of mid-range chips to compete with the Dimensity chips that have become the preference for several smartphone makers.

Qualcomm has been focusing more on the Snapdragon 700 series but apparently it’s time to improve the Snapdragon 600 series. According to a report from Wifuture.de the company is preparing a new array of SD600 series chips and some of them will have gaming variants possible with the G-suffix naming often found on the Snapdragon 700 series.

Qualcomm SM6375 and SM6225

The first platform is the Qualcomm SM6375 and will launch in four variants all of which will have different CPU and GPU clock rates. However they are still the same base. All four will have 8 CPU cores made of four Gold cores and four Silver Cores. The GPU clock speed is said to be between 940 Hz and 960 Hz.

Gizchina News of the week Join GizChina on Telegram

4x Gold cores at 2.1GHz + 4x Silver cores 1.8GHz

4x Gold cores at 2.2GHz + 4x Silver cores 2.0GHz

4 – Gold cores at 2.3GHz + 4x Silver cores 2.1GHz

4 – Gold cores at 2.5GHz + 4x Silver cores 2.2GHz

According to the source one of the developer platforms based on one of the chips has a maximum refresh rate of 144 Hz. It further reinforces the speculation that at least one of the processors will have the G-suffix. A wild guess states that we may see two of the chips arrive as the Snapdragon 695 and Snapdragon 695G respectively.

The Snapdragon SM6225 is the second chipset that was discovered by the source and it is expected to launch under the Snapdragon 690. It bags the part number SM6350. However there are similarities between the chipset and the Snapdragon 765 aka SM7250. Unfortunately more specific details about the CPU and GPU weren’t disclosed. However it has been reported that the specs of the testing platforms are in line with mid-range devices. That includes having 6 GB of RAM 128 GB of UFS 2.2 storage and a 90 Hz Full HD+ display.

The new Snapdragon 600 series will arrive soon

Both platforms are the fruit of TSMC manufacturing however their actual node size is unknown. Hopefully something smaller than 8 nm will come. Moreover the chips will be disclosed later this year as the above details are at least two months old already.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBob25lYXJlbmEuY29tL25ld3MvcXVhbGNvbW0tcmVwb3J0ZWRseS1kZXZlbG9waW5nLXNuYXBkcmFnb24tNjk1LTY5NWdfaWQxMzQ5NTPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Qualcomm reportedly working on Snapdragon 695/695G with support for 144Hz refresh rate,"Qualcomm is reportedly working on some new mid-range Snapdragon chipsets that come close to offering high-end capabilities. One of these chips is the Qualcomm SM6375 which will supposedly be offered in four different variants with the same base but with different CPU and GPU clock speeds. The GPU clock speeds are said to range from 800 to 940 or 960MHz depending on the model.





According to Winfuture.de  each variant of the chip contains four Gold cores and four Silver cores with different clock speeds. The four different versions include:





4x Gold cores at 2.1GHz with 4x Silver cores 1.8GHz

4x Gold cores at 2.2GHz with 4x Silver cores 2.0GHz

4x Gold cores at 2.3GHz with Silver cores 2.1GHz

4x Gold cores at 2.5GHz with Silver cores 2.2GHz

Qualcomm is testing developer platforms for the chip with displays supporting a 144Hz refresh rate. As a result it is possible that one variant will have a ""G"" tacked on to the end of its name. Winfuture says that at least two of the chips could surface as the Snapdragon 695 and Snapdragon 695G.





The second chipset allegedly being worked on by Qualcomm is the Snapdragon SM6225 which could become the new base model of the Snapdragon 600 series. Not much is known about its specs except that the chip is supposed to be similar to the SM7250 (Snapdragon 765). The SM6225 is expected to come with an octa-core design with an integrated 5G modem.





The testing platforms for the SM6225 contain lower mid-range specs including 6GB of RAM 128GB of UFS 2.2 storage and an FHD+ display that refreshes 90 times each second (90Hz). The SM6225 could replace the Snapdragon 665 which was released in 2018 with the model number SM6125.





Both the SM6375 and the SM6225 will be manufactured by TSMC using an unknown process node. And since the above information is at least two months old it is possible that we could see the new chips released sometime this year as long as the chip shortage doesn't interfere.

The pair have already leaked several times though as we have reported previously . Now @_snoopytech_ has revealed several key specifications about both devices.

Based on the renders published so far it seems that both devices have the same rear-facing cameras including a 108 MP primary camera. Additionally the pair have AMOLED displays an improvement on the IPS panels in the Mi 10T series. Refresh rates have reduced from 144 Hz to 120 Hz though. On the other hand the inclusion of 'adaptive sync' branding implies that the 11T series will vary their refresh rates from 1-120 Hz theoretically reducing power consumption.

However there are two major differences between the 11T and 11T Pro. As expected only the latter will utilise Xiaomi Hyper Charge shortened to 'HyperCharge' in the renders below. While the 11T does not support Xiaomi's 120 W proprietary charging method it will be capable of charging at up to 67 W.

Moreover Xiaomi will distinguish the 11T Pro from the 11T with SoCs. Specifically the Xiaomi 11T has the MediaTek Dimensity 1200 a 6 nm chip with four ARM Cortex-A78 cores and four Cortex-A55 cores. By contrast the Xiaomi 11T Pro utilises the Snapdragon 888 the current go-to flagship SoC got many Android OEMs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdpem1vY2hpbmEuY29tLzIwMjEvMDkvMTEvbmV3LXF1YWxjb21tLW1pZC1yYW5nZS1jaGlwcy1vbi10aGUtd2F5LXdpbGwtc3VwcG9ydC0xNDRoei1yZWZyZXNoLXJhdGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New Qualcomm mid-range chips on the way will support 144Hz refresh rate,"Qualcomm has announced a handful of processors this year but it still has more in the pipeline as revealed by a new report.

There is also a possibility that the chipsets may have gaming variants so we may see the G-suffix naming which Qualcomm uses for the Snapdragon 700 series get applied to the Snapdragon 600 series too.

Qualcomm SM6375: Different Clock Rates?

The slowest output lets the four gold cores run at a maximum of 2.1 gigahertz and the four silver cores at 1.8 gigahertz. There are also variants in which the gold cores each work at 2.2 2.3 and 2.5 gigahertz while the silver cores are each 2.0 2.1 and 2.2 gigahertz. The clock rate of the GPU also fluctuates between 800 and around 940 or 960 megahertz depending on the model.

We are talking about several SKUs but they all use the same base. It would be conceivable that Qualcomm would market the same chip in different versions under several names.

Targets gaming smartphones with 144 Hertz displays

The fact that Qualcomm is already testing developer platforms with displays with a maximum refresh rate of up to 144 Hertz speaks in favor of at least one model being geared towards gaming. It would therefore be conceivable that in this case too in addition to a basic version a gaming version with slightly higher clock rates would also come onto the market.

It remains to be seen how Qualcomm will position the new chip in its portfolio. The SM6350 below this in terms of the model number is marketed as the Snapdragon 690. Also the new SM6375 could thus come onto the market as the Snapdragon 695. Furthermore the gaming version could arrive as the Snapdragon 695G. However the naming of these chips are completely speculations from Winfuture.

Snapdragon SM6225 for the lower middle class

In addition to the SM6375 Qualcomm is also working on a new base model in the Snapdragon 600 series the SM6225. Basically the chip is obviously closely related to the SM7250 marketed as the Snapdragon 765. As of now there are no precise details on this chip. It seems that Qualcomm lets the features of its Snapdragon 765 “drip down”. Thus this platform should also come back with eight computing cores and integrate a 5G modem.

Funny name guessing

There must be a name after all the model range is already full of all kinds of names in the 600 range. The Snapdragon SM6250 which is named above the new SM6225 never came onto the market so it is more likely to be a successor to the Snapdragon 665 which was developed in 2018 under the model number SM6125."

The spirit-class vessel is setting sail on her first voyage and Baltimore’s first departure in more than 18 months.

Carnival Pride Resuming Sailings

The Carnival cruise ship arrived in Baltimore just days ago to prepare for the restart of operations from the port. The ship will be sailing on a 7-day itinerary from the Cruise Maryland Terminal in Locust Point to the Bahamas.

She is the first vessel to sail from Baltimore since Royal Caribbean’s Grandeur of the Seas and Carnival Pride were turned away from the port in March 2020. The Carnival Pride is also the ninth in the fleet to resume cruise operations.

Not to be outdone by today's exciting crane news look who's back! The @CarnivalCruise Pride has returned to the PoB and will sail this Sunday! A seven-night cruise to the Bahamas. Great to see her back in Baltimore! #Open4BizMD pic.twitter.com/T47Q6wONc3 — Port of Baltimore (@portofbalt) September 9 2021

Embarkation commenced following a “Back to Fun” ribbon-cutting ceremony in the terminal attended by Carnival President Christine Duffy Carnival Pride Captain Maurizio Ruggiero and Port of Baltimore Executive Director William P. Doyle.

Carnival’s Protocls From Baltimore

As with all Carnival Cruises guests onboard Carnival Pride will need to adhere to some safety standards to keep fellow guests and crew members safe from COVID during the seven-day voyage. The measures which are both from the CDC and Carnival Cruise Line include:

All guests 12 years old and above must be fully vaccinated 14 days before the cruise’s start.

Guests traveling with under 12 year old’s should apply for an exemption for the kids. If this is approved the children should undergo a PCR test three days before sailing and present the negative result at the terminal. They will need to undergo a second test before boarding. A third test will be performed before leaving the ship again.

All vaccinated guests must present a negative rapid PCR test taken at most two days before departure (guests on today’s sailing September 12 could still do this three days out). Carnival has presented several options for how this can be done in the last few days such as home testing and Quest Diagnostics .

and . Lastly the cruise line recently introduced new rules and regulations for the onboard casino.

Carnival Pride underwent refurbishments in 2014 to upgrade it to the Funship 2.0 standard with ​​Guy’s Burger Joint the BlueIguana Cantina RedFrog Pub and the BlueIguana Rum Bar.

Measuring 88500 gross tons and a capacity for just over 2100 passengers and a crew of 930 she will be sailing from Baltimore until October 31. After the deployment on the U.S. East Coast the ship will be repositioning to Tampa Bay. Carnival Legend will be taking over in Baltimore at that time.

He named Greyson after his daughter featuring a wolf for the logo. Schaefer said his mantra for the apparel brand is those who stand up for what they believe in and know when it’s time to lead the pack.

Greyson has had tremendous growth over the last few years merging fashion and sport and has big plans on the horizon. The brand has been championed by ambassadors like Erik van Rooyen (see our interview with him below).

We asked Schaefer some questions regarding the growth of the business and design.

Golfweek: Has the explosion in golf since the pandemic hit made it easier to find a customer base or harder because more fashion outlets are trying to get into the space?

Charlie Schaefer: We had been seeing nice growth with our customer base prior to COVID so it is difficult to say if the pandemic has had an impact in either direction. The golf space has definitely seen some saturation with a lot of brands entering the market recently. I don’t think that hurts Greyson on the contrary the budding competition helps bring visibility to the game. It has become very clear what brands are unique and authentic. We are incredibly fortunate as our customer base is deeply loyal and continues to support us as we expand.

GW: You once were high on brick-and-mortar stores. Obviously you still have the Detroit store but Palm Beach didn’t make it through. Is that the wave of the future or have you shifted your vision?

CS: Palm Beach was always meant to be temporary as it was a friend’s space. It was our opportunity to learn and continue to refine the model. I believe that brick-and-mortar is crucial to longevity and sustainability as it allows you to express truly who you are. Greyson’s retail plan is based on creating unique concepts where the physical store becomes a platform to experiment and bring our lifestyle and message to local communities. Not one store will be alike … each store will be unique to its surroundings with a focus on community and engagement. Our vision has always been clear in the sense that we will not do the traditional model … we will approach each store from a curator’s perspective. We value so intensely each community we enter so we will be sure to provide something unique and special. Let’s just say there are a lot of fun concepts in the near future.

GW: What obstacles do you see on the golf business horizon and what’s the biggest you’ve already hurdled?

CS: The biggest obstacle that we will always face is the pace of change in the sport. We have always highly respected the game but at the same token want to innovate and create an environment that is inviting and cool. I understood early on that if we do what we believe in (truly) and not think of “rules” that we would inevitably help create change with those who follow.

The hurdles have been tremendous for any startup company … raising capital making product selling product creating models managing cash flow hiring a team … hurdles not one more special than the other but with each obstacle that we stepped through we have become stronger. To me that is everything. I welcome obstacles as it gives us an opportunity to prove how strong we are.

GW: Do you see the brand expanding into a women’s line with its exponential growth on the men’s side?

CS: Yes. This fall we will finally take care of all the women in our lives. I am incredibly excited. We have built such a strong team that I have intense confidence around this expansion.

OK let’s get into the clothes themselves:

GW: What was the inspiration behind some of Greyson’s brighter patterns and prints?

CS: Life. nature looking beyond and being inspired by that which is around us. I am the person who looks at every piece of architecture and every shape of tree. I take trips to the park just to examine the colors of the birds. Visits to the zoo with my girls have a hidden agenda of geeking out on the patterns of jaguars giraffes and peacocks. I wander through botanical gardens marveling at the staghorn ferns the delicacy of orchids and the colors of the delphiniums. The inspiration around Greyson is endless as I pull inspiration from life.

GW: When introducing the golf jogger did you fear that the Tour would not accept them or see them as a casual pant?

CS: I didn’t care. The evolution of sport and specifically golf has seen some “colorful” fashion. Knickers have been in and around the game since the beginning. I believe that the jogger is the modern-day knicker.

GW: Greyson’s hoodies typically do not have a drawstring do you think that helps them stay more appropriate for competitive play?

CS: Yes that was very intentional. Our designs are educated and cater to the needs of the golfer. We do not have pouches on our cashmere hoodies. I believe that your clothes should transcend your life and style. By this I mean that you should be able to wear the same look from the office to the course to dinner. By making the styles cleaner and more sophisticated — hence no drawcord and pouch — we have allowed that piece to be worn in a multitude of occasions.

Key matchup: Gators vs. Bulls

South Florida’s run defense versus Florida’s ground game. The Gators ran for 400 yards in a 35-14 victory against Florida Atlantic – more than anyone else in the country and the program’s most in any opener. The Bulls meanwhile surrendered 293 yards and four touchdowns rushing in a 45-0 loss at North Carolina State.

Florida at USF: Players to Watch

South Florida: Andrew Stokes could get plenty of work and might be one of the team’s best players. The 27-year-old Australian punted eight times for 361 yards against the Wolfpack and averaged 45.1 yards. He had a 66-yarder and consistently had so much hang time that N.C. State managed just two returns for 12 yards. The 6-foot-5 228-pound Stokes spent the previous seven years playing Australian Rules Football.

Florida: Zach Carter who notched a career-high three sacks and a forced fumble in the opener expects to have about 40 friends and family on hand for his homecoming. Carter grew up in Tampa about two hours south of Gainesville and is looking forward to playing at Raymond James Stadium for the first time. He got oh-so-close to playing a championship game in the NFL stadium as a youngster but his little league team fell one game shy of making it to the big stage.

Most people at the open-air stadium Thursday did not wear masks. There was no vaccine requirement for fans something Biden has urged sports and entertainment venues to impose. Many other football stadiums are taking a similarly lax approach to pandemic measures this fall and that worries health experts.

This fall’s crowded college and professional football stadiums could create ripe conditions for COVID-19 to spread among unvaccinated fans experts say.

The risk of catching or passing a virus that has infected more than 40 million people in the United States will depend on where the stadium is and whether the game is outdoors among other factors.

How risky are stadiums?

It’s difficult to predict how many COVID-19 cases might develop from a single event. That depends partly on infection rates where the venue is located and how many people are vaccinated.

The highly contagious delta variant has triggered a surge in infections this summer that just recently started to taper. The seven-day rolling average for daily new cases in the U.S. sits at about 150000 after starting September above 167000 according to Johns Hopkins University.

At those rates it is “basically a certainty” that there will be at least one infected person at any gathering of a thousand people epidemiologist Ryan Demmer said.

Many football stadiums seat 60000 fans or more.

“At any sort of large event like at a football stadium without question there will be many infected people there” said Demmer of the University of Minnesota School of Public Health.

Has COVID-19 spread at other events?

Yes. The Lollapalooza music festival in Chicago drew about 385000 people in late July. Festivalgoers had to show proof of vaccination or a negative test. Nearly two weeks after the event city officials reported 203 COVID-19 cases connected to it.

In Wisconsin health officials have said nearly 500 coronavirus cases may be linked to the crowds that attended Milwaukee Bucks games or gathered outside the arena — estimated as high as 100000 one night — during the team’s push to the NBA championship.

Are venues taking any measures?

The NFL doesn’t have a blanket policy for masks or vaccination status for fans. That creates a patchwork of guidelines that each of the 32 teams has developed.

The Las Vegas Raiders for instance will require proof of vaccination for all fans age 12 and older. The New Orleans Saints and Seattle Seahawks will require that fans show proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test.

Louisiana State University a college football powerhouse has a policy similar to the Saints.

Many teams are asking fans to wear masks indoors but not requiring them while they are in their seats.

Football games are the latest events to resume with full stadiums or arenas following a summer of concerts NBA playoff games and baseball.

Do outdoor stadiums eliminate risk?

No. But they are considered safer because air circulates better in them which can hamper the airborne virus’s ability to spread.

That said there’s still an “extremely high chance” an unvaccinated and unmasked fan could wind up with COVID-19 if they sit next to an infected person for three hours or so even outdoors said Demmer the epidemiologist.

Most of the NFL’s 30 stadiums are open-air venues.

Four teams have closed roofs — the Detroit Lions Las Vegas Raiders New Orleans Saints and Minnesota Vikings — and five have retractable roofs that can be opened or closed.

A stadium that opened last year in Los Angeles and is home to the Chargers and Rams has a canopy-type roof and panels at each end that allow air in and out.

What precautions can fans take?

The biggest measure is becoming fully vaccinated. Doctors say the shots do not eliminate risk but they lower it considerably especially when it comes to developing a serious case that requires hospitalization.

“The delta variant is ... so much more contagious that if you’ve got clusters of unvaccinated people it’s going to rip through them” said Dr. Amesh Adalja of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.

Bringing masks and hand sanitizer to the game is a good idea said Dr. Sharon Wright chief infection prevention officer at Beth Israel Lahey Health in Boston.

She noted that masks are not perfect but they offer some protection. They also prevent people from touching their faces.

“Lots of people touch lots of things in sports arenas” she noted.

Once fans get to their seat they should try to stay there as much as possible to minimize contact with infected people Demmer said.

“Don’t wander around the stadium” he said. “Try not to stand in a lot of concession lines.”

The epidemiologist said there is no question that crowded stadiums this fall will lead to more infections but he also realizes that “we can’t live for the next five or 10 years not having large gatherings” because of the virus.

“I just wish everyone would get vaccinated and then we can really move past this once and for all” Demmer said.

He later moved to outside linebacker and got two blockers stopping him. He blitzed tried to cover Tampa Bay tight end Rob Gronkowski he spun around trying to find defenders and well just looked like a rookie.

To say the 51 snaps of Parsons first NFL regular season game was a learning experience is accurate. When that first game ended Parsons had seven tackles and was credited with a quarterback hit and a pass defended.

Not bad for the 12th overall pick of the NFL Draft that the Cowboys expect to improve.

“I thought it was a good start for him” coach Mike McCarthy said. “He’s beyond his years but he’s still working. His first time to play in an NFL game also the communication responsibility that he has to handle. That’s a new experience. I don’t care where you played or how much time you get in the preseason.”

Parsons is expected to get better in coverage especially against men like Gronkowski who uses their frames to shield defenders. When quarterback Tom Brady is throwing passes to a man like Gronkowski whom he’s got great chemistry with it’s difficult to defend.

On a pass reception Gronkowski had some space between him and Parsons and caught an easy pass from Brady. Over time Parsons might be closer to the receiver.

“That’s pro football” McCarthy said. That’s why they’re all special athletes. I thought (Parsons) looked comfortable. He made some mistakes. That’s part of it.”

Parsons started alongside Keanu Neal and played together for 48 snaps. With offenses in three-receiver or more sets the Cowboys will utilize a nickel package that has Parsons and Neal on the field a ton. Over time that could change depending on how Neal plays and if the Cowboys believe Jaylon Smith and Leighton Vander Esch deserve more playing time.

“You know football’s crazy because like it’s really just situational” Parsons said. “I wish I could’ve done more but some of the situations we were in whether it’s us backed up or us starting on the wrong side of field position can’t do much and you’re kind of limited. When a team got that many weapons and you’re in a certain field position you got to call certain calls. I think I wanted to do more but very limited day.”

Of the four main linebackers rookie Jabril Cox is not part of the main rotation Parsons will receive the majority of the snaps.

After the team drafted him the objective was to get him on the field in as many different down and distance situations as possible. The Cowboys want to use Parsons’ speed off the edge and through interior gaps of the offensive line to pressure the quarterback. He’s supposed to be a good tackler so playing a physical game is almost mandatory for him.

“I don’t really have trouble reading and reacting” he said. “It’s just more of what we’re in and how we can adjust to what (the offense is) in. I say I’m pretty fast and I have a good understanding of what’s going on it’s just you got to play better.”

It’s just one game to evaluate but life comes fast in the NFL. Week 2 the Cowboys visit the Los Angeles Chargers where another tight end Jared Cook (five catches 56-yards on eight targets in win over the Washington Football Team in Week 1) is the next.

But to face Brady a seven-time Super Bowl champion was a good first test.

“You learn what separates good quarterbacks from the good and great” Parsons said. “I think some of the decision making how good he was at getting the ball off seeing the coverages we were in I just felt like you could tell he’s been in the league for 22 years I’ll say that.”

Pre-Game Ceremonies,"In Thursday night’s season opener players stood on the field at Raymond James Stadium with their arms intertwined as Alicia Keys and the Florida A&M choir performed “Lift Every Voice and Sing” before the game’s start.

The N.F.L. began airing the song also known as the Black national anthem as part of its TV broadcasts before games following the worldwide racial justice protests held after the police killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor. It also included a performance of the song before the draft in April.

The league will continue to include the song’s performance in its pregame ceremonies as part of its continued social justice efforts.

“Lift Every Voice and Sing” written over 120 years ago by N.A.A.C.P. leader James Weldon Johnson captures in its lyrics the solemn hope for the liberty of African Americans which read in part:

“Sing a song full of the faith that the dark past has taught us.

Sing a song full of the hope that the present has brought us."

Intel ARC Alchemist All Set To Tackle NVIDIA GeForce & AMD Radeon GPUs In The $100 To $500 US Market Range

The leaked slide appeared on Baidu Forums (via Videocardz) and has been shared with retail partners by Intel. The slide lists down the proposed ARC Alchemist 'DG2' lineup for 2022 and respectively competitors they will be positioned against. According to the slide the lineup will include at least four SKUs but there may be more. Also the slide looks to be a little old since it doesn't mention the ARC branding that Intel just recently introduced for its graphics lineup so internal plans might have changed since then.

Intel's High-End ARC Gaming Graphics Card Lineup ($300 - $500 US)

With that said let's talk about the upper echelon of the lineup which will feature Enthusiast ($400 - $499 US) and Performance+ ($300 - $399 US) graphics cards. These Intel ARC Alchemist GPUs will feature the 'SOC1' which could be the internal codename for the Alchemist 512 EU chip. This chip has a TDP range of 175W to 225W. The Enthusiast part will tackle the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 & the AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT.

Do note that Intel doesn't plan to launch an 'Enthusiast+' contender in its first-gen ARC lineup as that will be reserved for the next-gen. This means that the top graphics cards from NVIDIA & AMD such as the GeForce RTX 3080 and the Radeon RX 6800 XT will remain uncontested.

Intel ARC ACM-G10 vs NVIDIA GA104 & AMD Navi 22 GPUs

Intel's Entry-Level ARC Gaming Graphics Card Lineup ($100 - $200 US)

Moving on to the lower-end segment this is one place where Intel may hit AMD and NVIDIA hard considering both GPU manufacturers haven't released a single sub-$300 US desktop graphics card in the market yet. The mainstream segment will feature the 'SOC2' which is the Alchemist 128 EU GPU and will feature a TDP of 75W and up. ARC graphics cards based on this chip will be featured in the 'Mainstream+' ($150 - $199 US) and 'Mainstream' ($100 - $149 US) segment.

Both AMD and NVIDIA do have the chips to launch in the entry-level segment but they are being pushed to notebooks and laptops first. If launched prior to Q1 2022 then entry-level ARC GPUs will tackle AMD's Navi 24 (RX 6500 Series) and NVIDIA's GA107 GPUs (RTX 3050 Series) though those may end up over $200 US pricing considering where the mainstream cards are currently featured.

A major lead that Intel could have over the competition especially NVIDIA since AMD lacks in this department is AI assistance in supersampling technologies. Intel has already showcased an impressive demo of its XeSS technology and based on the expected numbers Intel GPUs could outperform NVIDIA's Tensor Core implementation (DLSS) with its XMX architecture. Intel is also expected to feature a small but useful game cache on its GPUs and will be equipped with higher VRAM capacities of up to 16 GB (GDDR6) across a 256-bit bus interface. This would be twice as much memory as NVIDIA's RTX 3070 and RTX 3070 Ti so they may have to prepare a refresh to counter it.

We have seen the Intel Xe-HPG Alchemist GPU-based discrete graphics card engineering sample leak out a few months back along with some rumored performance and pricing figures you can read more on that here. Based on the timeline the Xe-HPG Alchemist lineup will compete against NVIDIA's Ampere & AMD RDNA 2 GPUs since both companies aren't expected to launch their next-gen parts by the very end of 2022. The Xe-HPG ARC GPUs will be coming to the mobility platform too and will be featured in Alder Lake-P notebooks.

However it's also becoming clear that they'll be almost uncontested in the low-end market... but according to another leak Nvidia is readying a refreshed RTX 2060 to fill that gap before Alchemist launches.

An alleged leaked slide posted on Baidu once again reiterates that Arc Alchemist intends to leave the top ""Enthusiast+"" class of graphics cards --- the RTX 3080 and RX 6800 XT as well as their higher-end halo-product cousins --- well enough alone. Instead the upper portion of the Alchemist lineup still referred to here by its DG2 moniker covers the upper-midrange market segment while the lower end ""SOC2""-derived GPUs target the clear gap in recent releases below the $300 price point.

It's rather surprising that the Alchemist product line is set to be derived from only two families of GPU silicon. By contrast AMD's Navi lineup has three silicon variants while Nvidia Ampere is based on four with the latter leading to the awkward performance gap between the GA104-derived RTX 3060 Ti and the GA106-derived RTX 3060.

Competition seems to be on the way too as according to insiders cited by VideoCardz Nvidia is readying the RTX 2060 for another outing. The Turing-based GPU will see its vRAM capacity bumped to 12 GB but other than that it is reportedly the same GPU that launched back in January 2019 rather than a higher-powered variant like the Super series.

Although it would lack the glamour of being the latest-and-greatest generation of graphics cards a re-released RTX 2060 could help fill out the low-end GPU market if priced appropriately as in laptops it's been shown to outpace the RTX 3050 Ti. However GDDR6 prices have exploded with the current GPU and console generation which may pour cold water on the prospects of a GPU with 12 GB of it going for cheap.

According to the report the card could reach market by the tail end of 2021 or January 2022 which would be just in time to pre-empt Alchemist GPUs moving into that same low-end market. It's perhaps a little optimistic that Intel could still consider the $150-199 class to be ""Mainstream+"" --- at least not since the GTX 1060 3 GB and RX 570 way back when --- but more competition in that price range is always welcome.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ub3RlYm9va2NoZWNrLm5ldC9MZW5vdm8tVGhpbmtCb29rLTE2cC1pbi1sYXB0b3AtcmV2aWV3LUEtY3Jvd2QtcGxlYXNlci1pZi15b3UtcmUtcmVhZHktZm9yLXNvbWUtY29tcHJvbWlzZXMuNTYwNjU2LjAuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lenovo ThinkBook 16p in laptop review: A crowd-pleaser if you're ready for some compromises,"Case - Metal unibody with gaps

The case is not that different from that of the Lenovo ThinkBook 15p. It's almost completely made of aluminum which makes the display and the keyboard base in particular comparatively sturdy. The silver-gray metal case is decorated by a Lenovo logo on the base unit as well as a ThinkBook logo on the lid.

The two hinges have a good grip on the display but the laptop can still be opened easily with one hand. At least one spot at the bottom showed uneven gaps but apart from that the build quality appears to be at a good level and we hardly noticed any creaking noises.

Fresh air is sucked in from the bottom and waste heat is dissipated towards the back and sides through two ventilation slots on the left and right respectively.

Reports from users on social media including Reddit and Facebook have reportedly been increasing over the past week. Devices exported to countries where Xiaomi’s smartphones aren’t sold have been getting a message to stop activations.

India and China are Xiaomi’s biggest markets but most of the company’s smartphones are designed to run on networks all over the world. With worldwide fame many users have been importing Xiaomi’s phones to other markets through various websites that ship globally despite the fact that Xiaomi’s terms and conditions prohibit such sales.

“Xiaomi policy does not permit sale or provision of the product to the territory in which you have attempted to activate it. Please contact the retailers directly for additional information"" the message tells users. The problem is apparently being seen by users in Cuba Syria Iran North Korea Sudan and Crimea.

“...since a few days people have been facing this issue (20+ cases that I'm aware of) where their phones after a few days of use are suddenly locked and on the screen"" a user who claims to be from Cuba wrote on Reddit.

The smartphone giant has been expanding the areas where its phones are sold over the past few years but its reach still pales in comparison to companies like Samsung and Apple. Xiaomi doesn’t provide a full list of countries where it sells devices but it is yet to enter the North American and many European markets.

East African Community Headquarters Arusha Tanzania 11th September 2021: EAC Secretary General Hon. (Dr.) Peter Mathuki has hailed the Republic of Burundi and the United Republic of Tanzania for ratifying the African Continental Free Trade Area Agreement (AfCFTA).

Burundi ratified the AfCFTA on 17th June 2021 while Tanzania on 9th September 2021.

Hon. Mathuki said that the AfCFTA would allow East Africans to access a large continental market and increase EAC’s exports to African countries outside the bloc.

“It will also improve movement of people across Africa advance trade and development aspirations and ultimately put the region in a better position to trade more with the rest of the world” said Hon. Mathuki.

Dr. Mathuki further disclosed that the EAC had initiated a number of steps towards the implementation of the AfCFTA Agreement adding that the ratification by Burundi and Tanzania would expedite the implementation of the agreement.

Other EAC Partner States that have ratified the agreement are Kenya Rwanda and Uganda. The Republic of South Sudan has signed the AfCFTA but is yet to ratify it.

Dr. Mathuki said that the bloc had almost finalized the submission of its tariff offers which conform to the agreed modalities in addition to the schedules of liberalization of trade in services.

“We have also prepared a draft strategy for the implementation of the Agreement which takes into account the need for capacity building. It is presently under consideration by the Partner States” said Dr. Mathuki.

“Further we are also fully involved in negotiations on the outstanding areas such as Rules of Origin Trade in services as well as the phase II issues on investment competition intellectual property rights and e-commerce” he added.

The Secretary General said that it was the expectation of the EAC that the AfCFTA would result in among other things lowering of business costs promote local content and provide a platform for settlement of disputes.

Dr. Mathuki said that EAC would leverage on its existing trade environment to reap maximum benefit from the AfCFTA namely the: regional customs and trade instruments; interconnectivity of systems including customs and other border clearance agencies; One Stop Border Posts; national Trade Information Portals; simplified trade regimes; trade exhibitions and symposia and; expansion of the EAC especially the anticipated admission of DRC into the Community.

The Secretary General said that the EAC was currently operationalizing a framework for trade development through the digitalization of markets information dissemination and showcasing the region’s products and market opportunities.

""I spent the whole [COVID-19] pandemic by myself. Well six months of it alone because Robert Sr. actually got stuck in Florida"" she said. ""He was too afraid to fly home.""

Although Mary went on to explain ""The first six months I was with my son [Robert Jr.]"" she admitted that the two weren't having much deep conversation. ""It's not like my son sits down and wants to talk to me"" she said. ""He's a teenager.""

Having alone time at home led Mary to an exciting new venture. ""Developing through that aloneness I started talking to myself. I was talking to the mannequins. Like it was not OK"" she said. ""So I came up with 'Why don't I get a podcast?'""

Mary and Robert Sr.'s Utah and Florida homes are just two of five that they own. On an episode of the show last season Mary revealed that they also have properties in Nevada New York and Indiana. ""Robert Sr. does love checking on all of the homes that we own"" Mary said noting the couple has no interest in having renters when they're not at one of the houses. ""When we're not there they are empty... We don't share.""

Now as CEO he’s guiding the family-run company through a most critical pivotal phase filled with opportunities centered on Nordstrom’s new “Closer to You” long-term growth agenda unveiled last February to the investor community as well as external hurdles ranging from supply chain bottlenecks labor shortages and increasing wage and delivery costs to uncertainties surrounding the pandemic compounding challenges in planning the business.

“These are very unpredictable volatile times. Today is a lot different than a year ago” Erik said in a wide-ranging candid interview. “We have a lot of challenges these days. I don’t think anyone is short on those. With the pace of change the mix of business and the mix of product obviously the pandemic is still causing a lot of uncertainty. Supply chain has been a big challenge for everyone both externally slowing down and just [creating] difficulty managing the flow of product. We are not a price-promotional retailer. Our customer looks to us for newness. That steady flow of product is really our lifeblood and it continues to be challenging to manage to a steady flow.”

Asked if managing certain categories is more difficult than others Erik replied: “It’s not that predictable. It changes. If it were that predictable we could get in front of it.”

On Aug. 24 Nordstrom Inc. reported second-quarter results that were mixed. There was improvement on the top and bottom lines from the year-ago quarter though the sales revenue fell below the 2019 level. Consequently Nordstrom shares took a big hit on the stock market as investors were disappointed that the retailer couldn’t keep up with competitors such as Macy’s and Kohl’s where second-quarter 2021 top-line figures surpassed second-quarter 2019 results.

Still Nordstrom cited “some real rebounding in stores in dressier categories” and that’s cause for optimism. Nordstrom Inc. did report sales momentum from the first quarter to the second quarter and healthy profits in the second quarter motivating the company to raise its outlook for the year. “Business continues to improve” said Erik. “Particularly for us in stores recovery has happened faster and more impactful than we had planned.

“On the category side we’ve seen a dramatic shift to some real important categories for us the dressier categories. There is still the overall trend of casualization but customers are buying for occasion to get back to work to get out in the world again. We always had a good reputation [catering to] high-stake occasions.”

The company’s “Closer to You” agenda calls for “widening the aperture” meaning a massive expansion of the digital assortment from 300000 items to potentially 1.5 million within three to five years; injecting lower-price offerings into the Nordstrom Rack off-price matrix to gain share from less-expensive off-pricers such as T.J. Maxx Ross Stores and Burlington Stores and finessing the three-year-old market strategy which revolves around linking Nordstrom full-line department stores Rack off-price stores Nordstrom Local locations and a variety of services in different ways to deepen customer engagements such as through BOPIS ship from stores and faster deliveries.

Nordstrom’s market strategy is fundamental to sustaining the company’s large and loyal customer base service reputation and recapturing what it had for so many years — an edge on the competition.

“The market strategy has a lot of traction. It’s been very successful. It’s now rolled out in our top 20 markets” Erik said. “In a nutshell it’s about leveraging those physical assets available in the market where the customer lives and the outcome is bringing much more selection at much faster delivery to the customer — at their doorstep at the store at curbside within the same day or next day. Our capabilities are being enhanced to serve customers much more on their terms.”

Asked how he knows the market strategy is working the red-haired soft-spoken CEO answered “We look at market share No. 1. Then we have performance metrics like how many customers are engaged with the different services. We look at trips a lot including digital trips.

“In the last year we were able to turn on Rack stores as part of our market strategy so Nordstrom.com orders can be picked up at any Rack location returns can be made as well. About 30% of our store pickups occur at Rack stores which is terrific.”

When the retailer first unveiled its Nordstrom Local service format in September 2017 in Los Angeles there was some sense that for consumers a learning curve was necessary to understand its functions and purpose. Nordstrom Locals are situated where customers live and work so trips to actual Nordstrom stores farther away for order pickups and returns can be avoided. Nordstrom Locals also offer alterations and styling assistance but do not sell merchandise.

“I think the concept is pretty understandable for customers” Erik said. “Customers take to them pretty quickly. It’s not like we have much marketing around them. The idea of having a neighborhood location where someone can do an order pickup or return instead of jumping in their car and going to a mall people pick up on it quickly.”

Currently there are a total of seven Nordstrom Local locations in Los Angeles and New York City. Asked if it was important to have Nordstrom Locals in other major markets to further the Closer to You agenda Nordstrom replied that enabling Rack “gave us a lot more coverage more quickly. … We still think there is a place for Locals. They’ve been very successful. We do plan on adding more. There is still opportunity to add some more in the L.A. and New York markets” which are Nordstrom’s two highest-volume locales. “But that faster ramp was by lighting up our Rack stores.”

Another possibility is for bringing Nordstrom Local to Seattle the company’s third-largest volume market and where Nordstrom is based.

To dramatically ramp up the digital offering to that 1.5 million item goal “We think it’s going to take a different model with different products different brands” said Erik. “The traditional wholesale retail model won’t get us there. Drop ship has been the example we’ve had in the past. It’s a way of bringing more product choice and [complete] brand expression. We need to add flexibility.

“A real good example is our Asos partnership. We are really excited about that and what we can do together with the Topshop brand” which is part of the Asos portfolio. “Topshop has been a big big brand for us for a number of years. But also there are other brands” at Asos.

In July Nordstrom revealed that it had acquired a minority interest in the Topshop Topman Miss Selfridge and HIIT brands owned by Asos the London-based fashion website. It’s an unusual type of partnership considering Nordstrom has not been in the business of investing in market brands that it sells at its stores and online. The deal is designed to help grow and ensure the future of the four British brands in particular the trendy and affordable Topshop women’s and Topman men’s labels.

The transaction also reflects Nordstrom’s efforts to bolster its appeal to younger shoppers. For decades the retailer’s image was rooted in catering to more traditional and mature audiences though in the past decade Nordstrom has made several initiatives to achieve a greater balance in the business including staging pop-ups and collaborations with emerging and advanced designers notably the Dover Street Market Incubator Brands as well as establishing a wholesale relationship with Madewell. An early initiative came in 2012 when the Seattle-based retailer became the exclusive distributor of Topshop and Topman in the U.S.

“We have a lot of respect for Asos and their capabilities” Nordstrom said. “That partnership can allow us to bring more exciting choice to customers but will take some different business models. We entered a joint venture with them. We made an equity investment in a holding company that owns the Topshop brands. It’s a clear signal of not only our openness but we think it’s a requirement moving forward. We have different ways of bringing customers the brands they want and the selection they want.”

Erik said the company’s e-commerce operation is “moving to more of a hybrid commerce model” though it wouldn’t be accurate to consider it a marketplace model at least at this point in time. “For us to have the capability of accessing the amount of product we think we need and that our customers want it’s going to involve product we own directly and product we don’t own as well.

“We still have quite a ways to go around maximizing our inventory selection for customers” added Erik. “There are two specific examples” he said citing “forward deployment of inventory” first. “That’s having inventory in stores in the markets as opposed to a centralized warehouse — more than what store sales require. You need to have really good store fulfillment capabilities to do that. It allows faster delivery.

“The flip side of that is inventory holdback. We still have some supply chain facilities to build out in our network” to have inventory in a market within a day of delivery to stores.

It’s generally believed that retailers make more money by selling an item in a store rather than online where there are rising fulfillment and delivery costs. But at Nordstrom “It’s parity profit-wise. We’ve been there for a few years now” said Erik. He explained that Nordstrom started investing in e-commerce operations years before most other retailers. Nordstrom.com launched in 1998.

He also said that sellers online don’t get commission whereas store sales associates do and that Nordstrom fulfills many of its online orders from stores which makes deliveries faster and less expensive.

“A Nordstrom.com sale and a Nordstrom store sale are pretty darn even” Erik said. “We absolutely do not care whether we make a store sale or a digital sale. A big part of our strategy is valuing engagement — not the sale in that visit. If we do a great job making a return in a store faster or making an order pickup faster customers don’t necessarily buy on that trip but they come back and become a customer in that store even if they never visited that store before. … I really feel strongly that serving that customer takes a singular focus and if you throw in criteria that’s not the customer’s criteria and say what channel do we want them to shop in that just makes us less effective. And I think it becomes transparent to the customer.

“When I grew up selling shoes I was taught with a customer return get them in the chair and make sure they leave with something else. That’s changed. If it’s most important to the customer to get in and out to make a return — great. Let’s make it fast. Look at things like curbside services. If you do it well customers want it and they do come back. Seeing the big picture there it’s much more about customer lifetime value than one specific interaction.

“I’ve been working here at Nordstrom for 45 years now. There is a natural tendency to think of the good ole days. I’ve always had a great appreciation for what came before and mainly it’s the culture and our values — things that are woven throughout our company. I really think they are more alive today than ever before. Our people are better than they were when I was selling shoes. The company has been able to keep its core values and apply them in a modern way for changing times.”

Erik first joined Nordstrom Inc. when he was 12 stocking shoes. “I didn’t get to start selling shoes until I was 15. I had to work into that.”

It could be assumed that it was a forgone conclusion that Erik and his two brothers Pete and the late Blake Nordstrom would automatically be part of the family organization at very young ages and quickly ascend the ranks. “That’s not true at all” Erik said. “But with our dad [Bruce Nordstrom chairman emeritus] the work ethic was really important. You turn 12 you get a job. He didn’t care where it was. I didn’t have a lot of job opportunity at 12 so working the stockroom seemed pretty good. It wasn’t like any of us graduated college and got into the corner office.”

After stocking and selling shoes Erik became an assistant department manager and later a department manager. He became the sole CEO in March 2020 after serving as co-CEO with his brother Pete following their brother’s death. Pete then shifted to president and chief brand officer. Their cousin Jamie serves as president of the

Nordstrom full-line stores and Blake’s daughter Alex (Erik’s niece) is an assistant buyer.

“For me Pete and Jamie we liked it and just kind of hung with it” Erik said. “Although I didn’t love it at age 12 that’s part of it” meaning taking the good and the bad that comes with any job.

“What I really liked all along was working in stores — the team aspect especially selling shoes. There’s some bonding in the stockroom that could go on there. It was very evident to me early on that people with different backgrounds and talents can come together and be better than any of us individually. You get the crew together every morning and talk about how we are going to take care of customers today and the curtain goes up and you’ve got to perform.

“We have been very explicit and absolutely believe that you can’t create a place where you treat customers well if you don’t first treat each other well. We have to be a great place to work.”

But retail is not for everyone especially when it comes to dealing with the public. “We have our share of turnover. Where we are a little different is that we get people who like it and stay with us for a long time. A number of people on our executive leadership team have been with us for over 30 years. That’s pretty humbling” he said.

There are also salespeople who have been with Nordstrom for decades.

“There is a woman who sells shoes in the store I am in right now [the downtown Seattle flagship] who sold shoes for me when I was a department manager — 35 years ago” he said. “Sometimes you hear about people today who don’t have a work ethic or don’t care. I don’t see that at all. We have new people who blow me away especially this last year when things have been so challenging. People care about doing a good job. They care about the company. They care about the customers and the people they work with. … It’s always very encouraging to see the caliber of the people we have. We are fortunate.”

Asked what makes Nordstrom distinctive in a country that’s still overstored Erik replied “First and foremost it’s the focus on the customer. Everyone says that but our aim is simply to make customers feel good. We think about that through the lens of getting closer to our customers physically in ways of having the product closer to the customer and in delivering one-on-one service which has always been important to us” he said.

Today that means delivering what the consumer wants and empowering them and bringing them a bigger selection. “We are a house of brands. We are not a price-promotional retailer. I think customers have confidence in coming to us for something new. Many don’t come to us with a shopping list knowing exactly what they want. They are seeking something new the breadth of our merchandise.”

Having two strong brands — Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack— enables the retailer to bring brand stories to life in a dynamic way. He cited the rise of On a fast-growing running footwear player.

“Our active shoe business is really good. One of our very top vendors now is On a fairly new brand. It’s not only become a big resource for us. We are one of [its top] retail partners. Here is a new [name] that has real innovation. Our team has done a good job of telling that story.”

Some vendors and industry analysts have the perception that Nordstrom is investing in Rack digital and technology at the expense of its full-line stores.

“I am a little surprised to see that. That is just not the case. Look at the investment in our Nordstrom stores both in our remodels in things like our pop-in shops but you also have to look at our New York flagship store. It’s the biggest investment we have ever made. Having such a flagship reflects our belief in physical retail. We really feel great about the store. It’s a modern world-class store.”

The New York store opened in October 2019 and cost well over the initial $500 million budgeted.

“I still believe as much progress as we made digitally telling a brand story with the brand partners we have and also with our own brand is more effective in a physical store than online” Erik said. “So we continue to invest in the capabilities of our physical stores and in linking them with our digital capabilities.”

Any good day starts off with a nice meal and I went to Solarium Bistro for breakfast.

Solarium Bistro is an underrated spot for any meal on Odyssey of the Seas because I think a lot of people are unaware or forgetful it exists.

They serve a traditional American breakfast along with pastries cheeses eggs and more.

Next up I had to take time to find the man that has sailed the most with Royal Caribbean Super Mario.

Mario has cruised the most on Royal Caribbean and has well over 8000 Crown and Anchor Society points!

He and I sat down for a interview on our YouTube channel which you can watch here.

At 10am I had an appointment for a virtual reality experience at Zone Zero.

Zone Zero is a new offering for Royal Caribbean and currently only available on Odyssey of the Seas. It is a fully immersive virtual reality event. It is complimentary although beginning next week Royal Caribbean will begin charging $18 per person.

Groups of four guests put on a head-to-toe VR suit and then hop into a virtual reality world. Royal Caribbean designed a space where you can literally walk around this virtual world and see your teammates and interact together while engaged in a fight against pirate monkeys and a big bad boss at the end.

Simply put this was incredible and unlike anything I have done before. I've played VR games but this an untethered experience and the closest thing I have seen yet to a Star Trek holodeck.

Our team had a lot of fun and I would gladly pay $18 per person to do this again.

Lunch today was back in Playmakers for one more round of bar food. Great as always and ever since cruises restarted I have become more of a Playmakers fan.

In the afternoon we did a few trivia sessions in the Music Hall. Didn't win but good fun.

Towards the end of the afternoon we packed up our belongings so the suitcases could be put into the hallway to be delivered to the cruise terminal the next day.

Dinner was in Wonderland which is somewhere I have dined a few times but was new to a few friends onboard.

The premise of Wonderland remains unchanged where your waiter escorts you down the experience with various foods and drink that look unconventional. Some taste great others are perhaps just a passing sensation.

Wonderland may never be my favorite specialty restaurant but it's a fun time and I think a restaurant everyone should try once because it is just so different.

Overall I really liked Odyssey of the Seas a lot. More so than the other Quantum Class ships I have been on because Odyssey has just enough tweaks enhancements and add-ons that make it stand out from her sisters.

Odyssey reminds me a lot of when I went on Harmony of the Seas following my Oasis and Allure sailings where a newer ship stands out from her predecessors because Royal Caribbean takes the opportunity to add so much more the older ships did not have.

I think the SeaPlex overhaul pool deck makeover and Izumi split (separate sushi and hibachi locations) make Odyssey easily my favorite Quantum Class ship in the fleet (full disclosure I have not been on Ovation or Spectrum) that I have been on.

We had a fabulous time on Odyssey and I hope I get to sail on her again soon.

Thank you for following along this live blog. Our next live blog will begin in October when Jenna sails to Alaska on Ovation of the Seas!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlY2FuY3Vuc3VuLmNvbS9yb3lhbC1yZXNvcnRzLWluLXRoZS1tZXhpY2FuLWNhcmliYmVhbi10aGUtYmVzdC1hbmQtY29taW5nLXNvb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Royal Resorts In The Mexican Caribbean: The Best And Coming Soon,"Post may contain affiliate links; we may receive compensation if you click links to those products.

He had reached the dying embers of Paris St.-Germain’s run in the Champions League. Yet again the dream of European glory that powered the club for more than a decade had been dashed.

Suddenly here he was clean through on goal: the best player in the world the hometown icon who has come to symbolize P.S.G.’s ambition prowess excess and hubris his flashbulb moment at his fingertips.

The finding of 'reasonable' evidence to conclude that the U.S. ally had breached international law in its conduct of the war in Gaza was released in a summary of a report being delivered to Congress on Friday.

It is the strongest statement that the Biden administration has made yet.

But the caveat that the U.S. was unable immediately to link specific U.S. weapons to individual strikes by Israeli forces in Gaza could give the administration leeway in any future decision on whether to restrict provisions of offensive weapons to Israel.

The first-of-its-kind assessment which was compelled by President Joe Biden´s fellow Democrats in Congress comes after seven months of airstrikes ground fighting and aid restrictions that have claimed the lives of nearly 35000 Palestinians mostly women and children.

Those were launched in response to Hamas attacks on Israel on October 7 2023 that saw 1300 Israelis murdered.

While U.S. officials were unable to gather all the information they needed on specific strikes the report said given Israel's 'significant reliance' on U.S.-made weapons it was 'reasonable to assess' that they had been used by Israel's security forces in instances 'inconsistent' with its obligations under international humanitarian law 'or with best practices for mitigating civilian harm.'

Israel's military has the experience technology and know-how to minimize harm to civilians but 'the results on the ground including high levels of civilian casualties raise substantial questions as to whether the IDF is using them effectively in all cases' the report said.

Sen. Chris Van Hollen the Maryland Democrat who led the push in Congress told reporters that even even though the administration had reached a general finding 'they´re ducking a determination on the hard cases politically inconvenient cases.'

Biden has tried to walk an ever-finer line in his support of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu´s war against Hamas.

He has faced growing rancor at home and abroad over the soaring Palestinian death toll and the onset of famine caused in large part by Israeli restrictions on the movement of food and aid into Gaza.

Tensions have been heightened further in recent weeks by Netanyahu´s pledge to expand the Israeli military´s offensive in the crowded southern city of Rafah despite Biden's adamant opposition.

Biden is in the closing months of a tough reelection campaign against Donald Trump. He faces demands from many Democrats that he cut the flow of offensive weapons to Israel and denunciation from Republicans who accuse him of wavering on support for Israel at its time of need.

Rep. Michael McCaul the Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee said the review was unnecessary 'and only contributes to politically motivated anti-Israel sentiment.'

'Now is the time to stand with our ally Israel and ensure they have the tools they need' he said in a statement.

The Democratic administration took one of the first steps toward conditioning military aid to Israel in recent days when it paused a shipment of 3500 bombs out of concern over Israel´s threatened offensive on Rafah a southern city crowded with more than a million Palestinians a senior administration official said.

The presidential directive agreed to in February obligated the Defense and State departments to conduct 'an assessment of any credible reports or allegations that such defense articles and as appropriate defense services have been used in a manner not consistent with international law including international humanitarian law.'

Nothing in the presidential directive would have triggered any cutoff of arms if the administration had more definitively ruled that Israel´s conduct had violated international law.

The agreement also obligated them to tell Congress whether they deemed that Israel has acted to 'arbitrarily to deny restrict or otherwise impede directly or indirectly' delivery of any U.S.-supported humanitarian aid into Gaza for starving civilians there.

On this question the report cited 'deep concerns' that Israel played a significant role in preventing adequate aid from reaching starving Palestinians. However it said Israel had recently taken some positive steps although still inadequate and the U.S. government did not currently find Israel restricting aid deliveries in a way that violated U.S. law governing foreign militaries that receive U.S. military aid.

Van Hollen accused the administration of glossing over what he said were clear Israeli blocks on food and aid deliveries during much of the war. 'That´s why we have hundreds of thousands of Palestinians that have nothing to do with Hamas on the verge of starvation' he said.

Lawmakers and others who advocated for the review said Biden and previous American leaders have followed a double standard when enforcing U.S. laws governing how foreign militaries use U.S. support an accusation the Biden administration denies. They had urged the administration to make a straightforward legal determination of whether there was credible evidence that specific Israeli airstrikes on schools crowded neighborhoods medical workers aid convoys and other targets and restrictions on aid shipments into Gaza violated the laws of war and human rights.

Their opponents argued that a U.S. finding against Israel would weaken it at a time it is battling Hamas and other Iran-backed groups. Any sharply critical findings on Israel are sure to add to pressure on Biden to curb the flow of weapons and money to Israel´s military and further heighten tensions with Netanyahu´s hard-right government over its conduct of the war against Hamas.

Any finding against Israel also could endanger Biden´s support in this year's presidential elections from some voters who keenly support Israel.

At the time the White House agreed to the review it was working to head off moves from Democratic lawmakers and independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont to start restricting shipments of weapons to Israel.

Israel launched its offensive after an Oct. 7 assault into Israel led by Hamas killed about 1200 people. Two-thirds of the Palestinians killed since then have been women and children according to local health officials. U.S. and U.N. officials say Israeli restrictions on food shipments since Oct. 7 have brought on full-fledged famine in northern Gaza.

Human rights groups long have accused Israeli security forces of committing abuses against Palestinians and have accused Israeli leaders of failing to hold those responsible to account. In January in a case brought by South Africa the top U.N. court ordered Israel to do all it could to prevent death destruction and any acts of genocide in Gaza but the panel stopped short of ordering an end to the military offensive.

Israel says it is following all U.S. and international law that it investigates allegations of abuse by its security forces and that its campaign in Gaza is proportional to the existential threat it says is posed by Hamas.

Biden in December said 'indiscriminate bombing' was costing Israel international backing. After Israeli forces targeted and killed seven aid workers from the World Central Kitchen in April the Biden administration for the first time signaled it might cut military aid to Israel if it didn´t change its handling of the war and humanitarian aid.

Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush in the 1980s and early 1990s were the last presidents to openly hold back weapons or military financing to try to push Israel to change its actions in the region or toward Palestinians.

A report to the Biden administration by an unofficial self-formed panel including military experts academics and former State Department officials detailed Israeli strikes on aid convoys journalists hospitals schools and refugee centers and other sites. They argued that the civilian death toll in those strikes - such as an Oct. 31 strike on an apartment building reported to have killed 106 civilians - was disproportionate to the blow against any military target.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvc2hvcHBpbmcvc2FicmluYS1lbGJhLXNhYmxlLWxhYnMtc2tpbi1jYXJlLW5ldy1wcm9kdWN0cy0xMjM1ODk1NzgwL9IBc2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvc2hvcHBpbmcvc2FicmluYS1lbGJhLXNhYmxlLWxhYnMtc2tpbi1jYXJlLW5ldy1wcm9kdWN0cy0xMjM1ODk1NzgwL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sabrina Elba Opens Up About A-Beauty Skin Care Line S’Able Labs: “African Ingredients Are So Powerful”,"If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website The Hollywood Reporter may receive an affiliate commission.

Growing up like many teenagers UN Goodwill Ambassador and entrepreneur Sabrina Elba suffered from acne and post-inflammatory skin hyperpigmentation. With a condition that causes dark spots where active red acne pimples once were she tried acids and many products from Sephora to clear her face of breakouts only for it to do more harm than good.

“I started to really feel the effects of that as I was growing up because the skin barrier damage it was getting worse” says Elba the founder of new skin care brand S’Able Labs. “It wasn’t getting better.”

Her mother however relied on the traditions of their Somali heritage to curate a natural skincare routine that always kept her skin breakout-free.

“I grew up watching [my mom] make [her] own products and face masks and DIY everything in the kitchen” she says. “I think that was probably I mean for sure the influence that led me to adding these African botanicals into the [S’Able Labs] skincare range.”

The potency of those natural ingredients passed down from generation to generation inspired the model to start her own African skincare line with husband and fellow African Idris Elba.

“The fact that we come from East Africa and [Idris] is from West Africa and this sort of continental theme African theme this Pan-African theme … what I realized and sort of become addicted to is these stories and heritage pieces around these ingredients and these customs” says Sabrina Elba.

Their African skincare or A-Beauty line is formulated with antioxidants — including turmeric okra quasil and black seed — to target skincare concerns on a cellular level like hyperpigmentation a common condition that people with melanin experience.

Among S’Able Labs’ newest products is their Okra Face Serum which is made with a trademarked bio-available retinol called SymRenew; African Resurrection Plant an antioxidant; the brand’s own Hyperprevent technology to lessen hyperpigmentation; and botanical peptides derived from okra which the company calls “nature’s Botox.”

“This has integrity behind it and an efficacy there” Sabrina Elba says. “And I want to show people that African ingredients are so powerful.”

According to a Slack message obtained by CNBC the company didn’t refer to any specific state but the message was sent to thousands of employees late Friday a day after the US Department of Justice sued Texas over its new abortion law.

“These are incredibly personal issues that directly impact many of us — especially women” the Slack message reads according to CNBC. “[I]f you have concerns about access to reproductive healthcare in your state Salesforce will help relocate you and members of your immediate family.”

The Slack message didn’t suggest the company was taking a position on abortion or the new Texas law noting that “we all have deeply held and different perspectives. As a company we stand with all of our women at Salesforce and everywhere.”

Later CEO Mark Benioff clarified that the company apparently did have Texas in mind when it sent the Slack message tweeting “Ohana if you want to move we’ll help you exit TX. Your choice” and linking to the CNBC report (the word “Ohana” is considered a neologism that is typically translated to mean “family” in Hawaiian).

The Texas law bans abortion after six weeks— before most people realize they are pregnant— has no exception for rape or incest and empowers anyone to sue someone else for “aiding and abetting” abortions after six weeks. That includes not only the person seeking the abortion and abortion clinics but anyone who helps pay for the procedure or drives a person to have the procedure.

In a rare moment of solidarity rival ride-hailing companies Lyft and Uber both said last week they would cover legal fees for any of its drivers sued under the Texas law. And Bumble and Tinder parent company Match Group announced the creation of a relief fund for women seeking abortions. Both companies have their headquarters in Texas.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm15aGlnaHBsYWlucy5jb20vbmV3cy9idXNpbmVzcy9zYWxlc2ZvcmNlLXRvLWhlbHAtd29ya2Vycy1sZWF2ZS1zdGF0ZXMtb3Zlci1hYm9ydGlvbi1sYXdzL9IBamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm15aGlnaHBsYWlucy5jb20vbmV3cy9idXNpbmVzcy9zYWxlc2ZvcmNlLXRvLWhlbHAtd29ya2Vycy1sZWF2ZS1zdGF0ZXMtb3Zlci1hYm9ydGlvbi1sYXdzL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Salesforce to help workers leave states over abortion laws,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://www.myhighplains.com/news/business/salesforce-to-help-workers-leave-states-over-abortion-laws/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm15aGlnaHBsYWlucy5jb20vbmV3cy9idXNpbmVzcy9zYWxlc2ZvcmNlLXRvLWhlbHAtd29ya2Vycy1sZWF2ZS1zdGF0ZXMtb3Zlci1hYm9ydGlvbi1sYXdzL9IBamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm15aGlnaHBsYWlucy5jb20vbmV3cy9idXNpbmVzcy9zYWxlc2ZvcmNlLXRvLWhlbHAtd29ya2Vycy1sZWF2ZS1zdGF0ZXMtb3Zlci1hYm9ydGlvbi1sYXdzL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpby5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS8xODkyMjgvaG93LWNvbnRhaW5lci1jYXJyaWVyLW9uZS1tYWRlLWl0cy1jcm0tc2hpZnQtYS1zbW9vdGgtb25lLmh0bWzSAWFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jaW8uY29tL2FydGljbGUvMTg5MjI4L2hvdy1jb250YWluZXItY2Fycmllci1vbmUtbWFkZS1pdHMtY3JtLXNoaWZ0LWEtc21vb3RoLW9uZS5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How container carrier ONE made its CRM shift a smooth one,"Ocean Network Express (ONE) is the world’s sixth-largest container carrier with a fleet size of about 1.6 million TEUs (20-foot equivalent units).

LEGO System A/S has made many a fan happy adult and child alike by producing unique brick models of some of fandom's favorite franchises. From Star Wars to Harry Potter from DC Comics to Marvel movie scenes and props all come alive on your own table with you in control of the creativity.

The Infinity Gauntlet the centerpiece of the last two Marvel's Avengers movies is one of the latest of a set of pop culture prop pieces released alongside similarly trade dressed packages of helmets of Darth Vader and The Mandalorian and the 1966 Batmobile (which we did on a live build stream here).

The Gauntlet stands upright on a presentation base (it's actually built onto it -- don't think you can lift it off and wear it) with mulitple points of articulation. The fingers bend at each knuckle allowing multiple configurations from a wave to a fist to a snap to... well yes that gesture as well.

BRITNEY Spears fans think that her boyfriend Sam Asghari is about to propose after he shared a photo of a diamond ring.

But before fans could get too excited the model deleted the photo and then claimed that he was hacked.

Soon after he shared another post with the explanation: ""Account got hacked and was photoshopped - calm down everyone!""

But it was too late as fans flocked to Sam's page and left comments under his latest modeling shot to express their delight.

""Congrats!"" came one comment while another person wrote ""Changing the topic I see [ring emoji].""

""You and Brit are gonna have some beautiful babies."" another fan wrote.

SHOPPING FOR RINGS

It's no surprise that fans are anticipating a proposal as Sam was pictured ring shopping at Cartier earlier this month hinting that he's ready to get down on one knee.

Britney expressed her desire to get married as she gave emotional testimony during a hearing for her conservatorship battle in June.

She pleaded with a judge to end the arrangement saying it is""doing me way more harm than good.""

She told the court she wants to marry her boyfriend and have a baby but that the conservatorship won't allow it.

She claimed she has to use birth control to prevent her getting pregnant.

She told the court: ""All I want is to own my money and for this to end and for my boyfriend to be able to drive me in his car.""

Britney recently won a major victory in her conservatorship battle so she may soon be able to get married after years of being banned from doing so.

This week her father Jamie filed to officially end his time as her conservator after 13 years of having control over her estate and personal matters.

VICTORY FOR BRIT

Jamie asked the judge to terminate the conservatorship without another mental evaluation.

Britney previously said that she didn't want to undergo a mental evaluation while testifying in court in June.

Sources told the outlet that Jamie made the decision to end the conservatorship due to public pressure as well as the pressure put forth by Britney's attorney Mathew Rosengart.

Additionally insiders said the Toxic singer's view of her dad and their relationship have not changed despite the filing.

Britney is believed to still be extremely angry at him over his role in the conservatorship.

The singer's next court appearance will take place on September 29 where she wants the issue of termination to be front and center.

It was previously reported that the purpose of the next hearing is to discuss Jamie's involvement in the conservatorship.

JAMIE FILES

Jamie 69 filed a petition to end the singer's conservatorship to Los Angeles Superior Court on Tuesday.

The paperwork states that the singer ""is entitled to have this Court now seriously consider whether this conservatorship is no longer required.""

Additionally the filing claims Britney's circumstances have changed ""to such an extent that grounds for establishment of a conservatorship may no longer exist.""

""As Mr. Spears has said again and again all he wants is what is best for his daughter"" the document says.

""If Ms. Spears wants to terminate the conservatorship and believes that she can handle her own life Mr Spears believes that she should get that chance.""

Judge Brenda Penny who oversees the case will need to approve the move.

Britney’s attorney Mathew Rosengart told The Sun regarding Jamie's petition: ""It appears that Mr. Spears believes he can try to avoid accountability and justice including sitting for a sworn deposition and answering other discovery under oath but as we assess his filing - which was inappropriately sent to the media before it was served on counsel - we will also continue to explore all options.”

With the new series starting next week the dancers are prepped with a spray tan - which has become a rite of passage for the famous faces who take part.

Although it seems like Tom is covering up Adam's private parts at first glance as you look back at the photo the gold medallist is wearing a tiny black thong.

Adam shared a screenshot of the message Instagram sent when they removed the photo which read: 'Your photo was removed. We removed your photo because it goes against our Community Guidelines on nudity or sexual activity.'

He wrote on the story: 'Great removed for sexual activity!' with a crying laughing face emoji.

In a bid to ensure safety in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic attendees were required to wear face masks while everyone was temperature checked before entering.

The veteran dance show was famously disrupted in 2020 thanks to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

But it seems things are back to normal in 2021 - apart from one or two factors still deemed too tricky to navigate amid the global health crisis.

The Blackpool episode ordinarily takes place near the end of the series but was axed last year with restrictions throwing up logistical difficulties on the production.

But 2021 will include the show's themed weeks - such as movie week musicals week and Halloween week.

Last year these were scrapped proving too complicated to manage amid the pandemic. The show's Christmas special will also be back with the show set to start in its usual early-autumn time slot rather than in October like last year.

Developed by the Southern Land Company and designed by Solomon Cornwell Buenz a team that is also collaborating on a residential tower underway nearby at 1620 Sansom Street The Lauren Rittenhouse rises just to the northwest of Rittenhouse Square Park. The building already stands 49 stories tall and will shortly rise to its final planned height of 599 feet. The development will feature 185 rental units and 64 luxury condominiums.

The building has made substantial progress throughout this year as in February the structure had only reached its halfway point. The concrete began to rise rapidly once the major terrace was formed on the south side of the building in April. The structure then shot up even more quickly once the taller luxury floors were underway. In July we reported in the previous update that the last residential slab has been poured.

The Laurel has grown slightly since the last update with minor work continuing at the very top. In the meantime the facade reaches the 37th floor. The final slab was wrapped in concrete molds for some time while metal ties was also placed to attach the steel to the building. The main roof rises 562 feet high while the highest concrete level sits nearly 580 feet high. The previously projected top out date for the building is September 23rd.

The Laurel Rittenhouse is scheduled for completion in August 2022.

Canadian Pacific first put forward a roughly $29 billion bid for Kansas City Southern in March before being topped by a $33.7 billion offer from its rival Canadian National in April. But the Canadian National deal hit a key regulatory challenge this month sending Kansas City back to talks with Canadian Pacific. The talks proved fruitful.

The crown jewel in the deal is Mexico as the railroads look to capitalize on trade flows across North America on the heels of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement signed into law last year.

Closing a deal could take time. It must be approved by shareholders of both companies as well as approved by Mexican authorities and the Surface Transportation Board the U.S. regulatory board that oversees rail deals.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wb3N0aW5kZXBlbmRlbnQuY29tL25ld3MvZGV2b2lkLW9mLWxpZmUtc29vbi10aGVyZS13aWxsLWJlLWp1c3QtMTYzLXdpbGQtaG9yc2VzLWxlZnQtaW4tZmFtb3VzLXNhbmQtd2FzaC1iYXNpbi1oZXJkLWFmdGVyLWJsbS1yb3VuZHVwL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Devoid of life': Soon there will be just 163 wild horses left in famous Sand Wash Basin herd after BLM roundup,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.postindependent.com/news/devoid-of-life-soon-there-will-be-just-163-wild-horses-left-in-famous-sand-wash-basin-herd-after-blm-roundup/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wb3N0aW5kZXBlbmRlbnQuY29tL25ld3MvZGV2b2lkLW9mLWxpZmUtc29vbi10aGVyZS13aWxsLWJlLWp1c3QtMTYzLXdpbGQtaG9yc2VzLWxlZnQtaW4tZmFtb3VzLXNhbmQtd2FzaC1iYXNpbi1oZXJkLWFmdGVyLWJsbS1yb3VuZHVwL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDkvMTIva2Fuc2FzLWNpdHktc291dGhlcm4tcGlja3MtY2FuYWRpYW4tcGFjaWZpYy0zMS1iaWxsaW9uLWJpZC1mb3ItcmFpbHJvYWQuaHRtbNIBcGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tL2FtcC8yMDIxLzA5LzEyL2thbnNhcy1jaXR5LXNvdXRoZXJuLXBpY2tzLWNhbmFkaWFuLXBhY2lmaWMtMzEtYmlsbGlvbi1iaWQtZm9yLXJhaWxyb2FkLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kansas City Southern picks Canadian Pacific's $31 billion bid for railroad,"Kansas City Southern (KSC) Railway locomotives idle on a fuel pad before pulling freight trains from Knoche Yard in Kansas City Missouri U.S. on Thursday April 16 2015.

Kansas City Southern has decided that a $31 billion bid from Canadian Pacific is the best of two offers on the table to buy the railroad.

The Kansas City Missouri company said in a statement Sunday that it has notified rival bidder Canadian National that it intends to terminate a merger agreement and make a deal with Canadian Pacific.

But it's not final yet. Canadian National still has five business days to negotiate amendments to its offer and the Kansas City Southern board could determine that a revised CN offer is better.

In its own statement Canadian National said it's evaluating its options. ""CN will make carefully considered decisions in the interests of all CN shareholders and stakeholders and in line with our strategic priorities"" the railroad said.

Under the Canadian Pacific offer each share of Kansas City Southern common stock would be exchanged for 2.884 CP shares and $90 in cash.

""We are pleased to reach this important milestone and again pursue this once-in-a-lifetime partnership"" said Canadian Pacific President and CEO Keith Creel.

Canadian National's bid was $33.6 billion but regulators rejected a key part of the offer last month.

The Surface Transportation Board said Canadian National won't be able to use a voting trust to acquire Kansas City Southern and then hold the railroad during the board's lengthy review of the overall deal.

In contrast regulators have already approved Canadian Pacific's use of a voting trust because there are fewer competitive concerns about combining Canadian Pacific and Kansas City Southern.

Canadian Pacific set a deadline of Sunday for its offer. Both Canadian bids include a mix of cash and stock and the assumption of about $3.8 billion in Kansas City Southern debt.

It's not yet clear whether Canadian National has any appetite to increase its bid because it is facing pressure from a major shareholder to abandon the deal. London-based investment firm TCI Fund — which owns about 5% of CN's stock — maintains that CN should overhaul its board get a new CEO and refocus its efforts on improving its own operations.

For more than two decades the railroad industry has been stable with two railroads in the Western United States — BNSF and Union Pacific — two in the Eastern United States — CSX and Norfolk Southern — Kansas City Southern in the Midwest and the two Canadian railroads that serve part of the United States. Regulators have said that any merger involving two of the largest railroads generally needs to enhance competition and service the public interest to get approved.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hcHBlbm1lZGlhLmNvbS9zY2hvb2xzL2lubm92YXRpb24tYWNhZGVteS13ZWxjb21lcy1zdHVkZW50cy10by1uZXctYWxwaGFyZXR0YS1jYW1wdXMvYXJ0aWNsZV8xMGVmZTE5MC0xMjQ3LTExZWMtYTVmOS01N2EwYjA2OTgyOWEuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Innovation Academy welcomes students to new Alpharetta campus,"ALPHARETTA Ga. —After nearly a decade five superintendents a recession and a pandemic the area’s first STEM (science technology engineering math) high school opened its doors to students in August.

Fulton County Schools’ Innovation Academy hosted a ribbon cutting ceremony Aug. 31 attended by local dignitaries and school officials who gathered at the campus in downtown Alpharetta.

The magnet high school completed with a $69.3 million budget opened with a full enrollment of 900 students in grades 9 through 11 selected by a lottery from students across the North Fulton region. Next year the school will have all four grades. A similar STEM high school also opened in August serving students in the South Fulton region.

Fulton Schools’ Innovation Academy is located on the site of the original Milton High School which stood for nearly 80 years. Only the athletic fields remain from the original campus after it was rebuilt in 2005 on a new site in Milton.

Principal Tim Duncan said the process from drawing board to opening bell was worth the wait for the new school.

“Based on the feedback our pre-work and research paid off as the students all showed up and had an amazing first week” Duncan said. “Beyond just entering a new environment with new concepts our students had to adjust to all new friends.”

He noted the transition during the first week was made easier with many collaborative activities such as a design-thinking potable water project and the first IA Olympics that helped accelerate the bonding process of students.

Closer bonding may have to wait a little while as the school opened in the midst of a resurging COVID-19 pandemic.

Duncan said the school has had a very low rate of positive COVID cases in the first month. He attributed that to good adherence to safety protocols like washing hands and wearing face coverings.

“Every day I say ‘stay apart to stay together’” Duncan said. “They seem to all really want to be at school so they are willing to make these small sacrifices to be with their friends in face-to-face learning.

He said he wants to focus energy on relationship building and establishing routines as students see increasing rigor in the classroom.

“We are constantly looking at how to add additional supports” Duncan said. “We are excited to announce our mascot school colors and launch our clubs this month.”

September is also “wellness month” with a focus on everyday activities to build a healthy mind body and spirit he added.

Fulton Schools’ Innovation Academy provides another learning option for students outside a traditional high school. The curriculum focuses on building “creators and problem solvers” Duncan said with students on career paths of healthcare sciences engineering or informational technology.

The school is supported by a long list of community partners including WellStar and Emory health systems Children’s Hospital Georgia Tech and Georgia State universities Southern Company AT&T and Microsoft.

Mentors from all sectors of area business and civic organizations will also lend their expertise and guidance to students."

On some short flights you might not have even received water.

While some things look different most airlines have since resumed many elements of their onboard service. However Southwest has taken a more conservative approach. It initially suspended all onboard beverages and snacks and then only served water for many months. It was only this March that it began to offer a (very) limited selection of sodas on some of its flights again. Then in late June it resumed coffee service on most flights.

One thing that Southwest hasn't resumed yet is alcohol sales. The carrier was planning to resume it on select flights over the summer but delayed it due to a surge in reports of unruly passengers. As reported by USA Today the Dallas-based carrier has now confirmed that it won't restore inflight booze until at least early 2022.

Southwest details inflight service plans

As of June 24 Southwest resumed serving complimentary coffee on all flights of 251 miles or longer. Originally it was also going to reintroduce alcohol sales on some flights on that date. However that's been delayed.

In late May Southwest provided the following explanation:

Given the recent uptick in industry-wide incidents of passenger disruptions inflight we have made the decision to pause the previously announced re-start of alcohol service onboard June (Hawaii flights) and July. We will proceed with expanding our selection of soft drinks and coffee as planned. We realize this decision may be disappointing for some Customers but we feel this is the right decision at this time in the interest of the Safety and comfort of all Customers and Crew onboard.

Southwest originally didn't provide a timetable for when it might bring back alcohol. However in a memo sent to flight attendants on Sept. 10 Randall Miller senior manager of inflight operations explained that the alcohol sales won't resume until at least the end of January 2022.

The memo notes ""With the mask mandate being extended to January 18 2022 there are no current plans to bring back alcohol prior to January 2022.""

This date coincides with when the federal mask mandate on public transportation networks — including at airports and onboard airplanes — is set to expire. American Airlines also delayed the return of alcohol sales in mid-August shortly after the mandate was extended though continues to offer alcohol in premium cabins.

Southwest's original plans were to reintroduce alcohol sales on flights between the U.S. mainland and Hawaii starting on June 24 and expand to all flights 251 miles and longer beginning July 14. There were going to be several different kinds of beer wine and spirits on offer:

Miller Lite ($6)

Dos Equis ($6)

Blue Moon ($7)

Carmenet Cabernet Sauvignon ($6)

Mossel Bay Chenin Blanc Chardonnay ($6)

Deep Eddy Vodka ($7)

Jack Daniels Whiskey ($7)

Bottom line

Though hopes had been raised that Southwest's alcohol service might resume before the end of the year you're now going to have to wait until at least the end of January 2022. Given today's news Southwest will likely further extend any expiring drink coupons.

For the time being you'll have to settle for soft drinks such as coffee Coke Diet Coke 7-Up and water.

The Dallas-based carrier had planned to resume selling alcohol in late June after a more than 12-month hiatus but quickly shelved those plans after a flight attendant was subjected to a brutal assault.

“With the mask mandate being extended to January 18 2022 there are no current plans to bring back alcohol prior to January 2022” Randall Miller a senior manager of inflight operations told staffers in the memo.

Alcohol misuse has been widely cited as one of the main contributors to unruly passenger incidents. Commentators however argue that disruptive passengers are getting intoxicated in airport bars and then smuggling their own alcohol onto planes.

It remains an offense for passengers to consume alcohol they’ve brought onboard themselves but it’s difficult for flights attendants to enforce and many passengers go unsanctioned.

The measures are supported by flight attendant unions but most airlines have already brought back alcohol after slashing in-flight service during the first wave of COVID-19 early last year.

American Airlines has though also delayed the return of ‘buy on board’ alcohol in Main Cabin on domestic routes citing the surge in unruly passenger incidents since the start of the year. The airline has already extended its own alcohol ban through January 2022 to coincide with the federal mask mandate.

As a result the alcohol ban could be extended yet again if President Biden doesn’t lift the mask mandate.

Southwest had been planning to start selling beer and wine on flights to and from Hawaii starting June 24. Onboard alcohol sales would have then been extended to all flights over 250 miles from July 14. More alcohol options including wine vodka and whiskey would also have been added on this date.

But on May 23 a Southwest flight attendant on a flight from Sacramento to San Diego was allegedly punched in the face with such force that she needed two teeth removed and replaced with crowns. Vyvianna Quinonez 29 was recently charged with assault causing serious bodily injury and interfering with a flight crew member.

Following the assault the Southwest flight attendant union pleaded with the airline’s management to take action to protect crew.

Now that's a tagline. Screenshot by ZDNet

Flying has always been an activity that requires a balance of hope expectation patience and fear that it's all going to go wrong.

This may at least partly be because four big airlines own more than 80% of all America's seats. It may also be because these four airlines tend to run their businesses with very little room for maneuver when things go awry.

Still one of the raunchiest debates currently is whether business travel will ever return. Or should that be ""return""?

Some believe Microsoft Teams Zoom Webex and their brethren have become so ingrained in our business lives that they now masquerade as natural behavior.

Others still cling to the nirvanesque idea that humans need to be with humans in person in order to be truly effective. And happy.

In then steps American Airlines to encourage businesses to let their people fly. On Delta United or Southwest that is.

As spotted by travel writer JT Genter American thought the week before Labor Day the perfect time to quietly change its so-called conditions of carriage. (As if modern flying in some way resembles being driven in a private horse-pulled four-wheeler.)

The Condition Of My Carriage Is Subject To Change.



You may be familiar with the sleight of word that comes with changes in say the terms and conditions of almost every service you use on the web.

The tech company tells you and you don't read them. You subsequently realize the tech company now owns the right to tell everyone which website you frequent and perhaps also to remotely photograph your pets.

These new American carriage conditions slipped in without notice may incite similar turbulence.

Sample: ""We are not liable if: We're late or you don't make your connection we change the schedule of any flight we (or our partners) cancel a flight or route your checked baggage is late (except as required by statute regulation or Convention) [or] there are special incidental or consequential damages because of these changes.""

While I hear a Facebook lawyer snigger in admiration I find myself wondering: ""Is American Airlines trying to say it's not really liable if anything goes wrong? Anything at all? It's not liable if it or its partners cancel a flight? Really?""

I fear one or two American Airlines customers may wonder whether this all sounds a touch one-sided. Can a company really make such a draconian declaration?

Well how about this on the subject of voluntary bumping: ""When you volunteer to give up your confirmed seat on a flight we will compensate you in a form and in an amount we think is fair.""

This is quite some fairness doctrine especially coming from an industry not universally renowned for its fairness.

Talking of fairness this sentence may excite: ""If we or our airline partner fails to operate or delays your arrival more than 4 hours our sole obligation is to refund the remaining ticket value and any optional fees according to our involuntary refunds policy.""

There's customer service for you.

Stranded? Hey It Happens.

Now that we're on that subject please intrepid business traveler fear being stranded by American.

The airline used to cover the cost of an overnight stay or cover the cost of an approved hotel. Now not so much.

Instead this: ""We don't guarantee reimbursement for hotel expenses if you book directly without written authorization from American Airlines.""

If there's one thing that must be so easy when you're stranded it's to get written authorization from the airline to you know get a night's sleep.

Other changes might similarly move you.

It used to be that if the airline caused you to miss a connection it would get you on the first available flight American or not. Now not anyone but only on American or one of its partners. Which might prove a little more awkward.

Why Now? Who Knows?



In a fit a naiveté I asked American why it had chosen to make these changes at this time. I'll update should a response arrive at my gate.

Some observers believe the airline is merely offering legal definitions of practices it's upheld for some time.

Still though why now? Why when you want business travelers to feel more confident when you're worried that the Delta variant is slowing business?

The excessively cynical will point to a more specifically disturbed airline landscape.

In American's case the airline's pilots are threatening to picket if management doesn't change its ways. The pilots' union offered these troubling thoughts: ""Unfortunately management has repeatedly demonstrated its inability to run a reliable airline.""

So this ""too bad if you're stranded"" idea is consistent with this allegation?

The union also claims ""management often resorts to making up its own rules"" during flight delays.

The problem with such recondite changes for passengers is that they don't really know about them. Until that is they're affected by them.

If you remember business travel it did sometimes involve tight connections and tiring demands. Imagine getting stranded not getting American Airlines' written approval because there are 54 people in front of you and only one customer service person at the desk and then having to explain the costs to your CFO.

Shortly after they declare: ""Expense denied.""

It's not exactly an inducement to flying for a sales meeting is it?

By the by the current American Airlines tagline is: ""You Are Why We Fly.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNndWlkZS5jb20vbmV3cy9pLXVzZWQtdGhlLWRvbGxhcjE3OTktZ2FsYXh5LXotZm9sZC0zLWFzLW15LWxhcHRvcC1oZXJlcy1ob3ctaXQtd2VudNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,I used the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 to replace a laptop — here's what happened,"Squeezed in the window seat of a Southwest Airlines flight I had a revelatory moment with my Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3. While the person next to me had conked out I was typing away writing an article about why 49-inch ultrawide monitors transformed how I work. The irony of writing about monitors that are almost four feet wide on a display that's merely 7.6 inches diagonally was not lost on me. Still during a recent flight with the Z Fold 3 as my primary device I couldn't get over how far technology had come.

My task was simple: use the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 as a laptop on a short domestic flight. In this case I was flying three-and-a-half hours from Houston to New York for a work trip. Instead of taking out my Microsoft Surface I would set up a Z Fold 3 on a tablet stand and use the iClever BK08 a squat foldable Bluetooth keyboard as my primary input tool. The experience was surprisingly usable even if Android still has some hiccups with mouse support.

While the plan was to use the Z Fold 3 to accomplish all my editing duties Southwest Airlines' abysmal Wi-Fi made doing anything almost impossible. Even loading Slack messages was maddeningly futile. Instead I opted to open Microsoft Word and type our the opinion piece linked above.

The typing experience on Word for mobile running on my Z Fold 3 was fine — not as robust as the desktop version would be but that was to be expected. Using the iClever BK08's trackpad worked like any other mouse on a laptop. The cursor appeared just as I would expect.

Multitasking like a laptop on a Galaxy Z Fold 3

The great thing about the Galaxy Z Fold 3 was its ability to snap multiple apps on the screen at once. I had a Word document open on one half of the Z Fold 3's main display while on the other Slack was there telling me it was unable to connect.

Apart from in-flight Wi-Fi woes I ran into some odd quirks that still need to be ironed out in Android. For example using the mouse to highlight over text is impossible with a trackpad. Android wants you to highlight with your finger against the touchscreen. It's one of those things that pulls you out of the experience and was a reminder I was using something that's still a touchscreen device first and a laptop second.

In terms of battery life obviously using the phone's full stretched out display for three-plus hours was a drain. But battery life wasn't dropping as exponentially as I thought it would. The percentage meter at the top right trickled down slowly. I still had an Anker PowerCore Slim beside me to give my phone an emergency top-off if necessary but honestly it handled things well.

Eventually I did get some Wi-Fi during my flight and was able to connect to Spotify for a few brief minutes. It made drowning out the cries of the screaming baby a few rows back a welcome reprieve even if only for the length of a single song.

But using Spotify in the background while typing away on my article worked on the Galaxy Z Fold 3 just as it would on an actual laptop. I found no issues when using both the Sony WF-1000MX3 earbuds and wireless keyboard on Bluetooth.

The Galaxy Z Fold 3's impact

After graduating from college I was working at a T-Mobile store in Austin while trying to get my journalism career off the ground. I was always surprised at the number of people who would walk into the store those with generally bad or subpar credit who would opt to get a Samsung Galaxy Note 3. The phone was often the most expensive device at our store but still these buyers were willing to pay half or the entire phone up-front to get it. It just didn't make sense to me.

It was in talking to people who work in the fast food service industry did I realize that for these buyers they weren't buying a Note to splurge — they were buying a Note because it was meant to be their primary computer.

Oftentimes having a separate phone and laptop is a luxury for those on tight budgets and minimum wage incomes. For those folks the Galaxy Note was a multipurpose device — not just for watching videos or making calls but as something they could take notes on. For them screen real estate was everything as it directly equated to how much they could do.

(Image credit: Imad Khan)

Once the Z Fold series does drop to the $1000 price point over the next several years I hope it will be a revelatory moment for more phone buyers as it has been for me. But until that happens foldables are a fascinating bridge between phones and laptops for those who can pay the premium.

Final impressions

The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 is not a perfect laptop replacement. It still feels very much like using an Android tablet but with a mouse and keyboard. And both Google and Samsung will need to spend more time enhancing the user experience before we can start recommending that people stop bringing their work laptop with them on a flight.

Samsung also needs to do more with Dex on the Galaxy Z Fold 3. Dex is an interface that changes the Android user interface to mirror a more familiar Windows desktop experience. But to access this interface a Z Fold 3 needs to be connected to an external monitor. I believe Samsung should let you use the Z Fold 3 internal screen as that display eliminating the need for another monitor. And I know Samsung can do it as the Dex user interface can be enabled on other Samsung tablets. Extending Dex to the Z Fold 3 could truly replace a laptop during emergency situation.

My Galaxy Z Fold 3-as-laptop experiment worked. But my use case was a lot less than what others might use their laptop for. If you just need a device that can check emails send messages listen to music and watch videos then using the Galaxy Z Fold 3 as a temporary laptop works tremendously well. It's something that can only get better from here. Samsung has already laid down a solid foundation giving the Z Fold 3 tremendous potential."

The complex consisting of five three-story apartment buildings is eyed for land east of Franklin Lane and north of Milford Brook. The apartment buildings will consist of 51 affordable and 117 market-rate apartments. Of those 75 will be one-bedroom units 83 two-bedroom units and 10 three-bedroom units.

The developer JG2 Manalapan Residential Development LLC also will include a clubhouse with a pool sidewalks and 342 parking spaces.

Information about the proposed market-rate and affordable rents for the units was not immediately available.

The Planning board which met Thursday approved the development in an 8-0 vote.

Affordable Housing: Manalapan affordable apartments on Route 33 get preliminary OK

Michael D’Agostino a resident of Manalapan and relative of the board’s secretary Daria D'Agostino questioned the three-story height of the project during public comments.

John Giunco the lawyer representing the developers explained that the height and density were necessary to help accommodate the project's 51 affordable units.

Several people raised concerns about the safety of jaywalkers crossing Franklin Lane to the strip mall along Route 9. Board member Barry Fisher owner of Ace Home Improvements across from the proposed site recused himself from the vote but nonetheless raised concerns about the location.

“My concern is this” Fisher said. “We’re going to have children out there. Those cars do 50 miles an hour…Something has to be done to slow those cars down.”

Initially the developers proposed only one crosswalk at the north end of the complex.

“The purpose of why we had it at the northern end is so it will be the safest location to cross over Franklin Lane” Giunco said.

But Fisher noted the coffee shops near the south end and said “People are going to be crossing in-between to go to Starbucks and some of the others. I don’t think they’re going to walk all the way down to the north part and cross over. I think they’re going to cross over on the southern side also.”

Board planner Jennifer Beahm agreed “They’re going to cross ... regardless of whether you have a crosswalk or not. But putting a crosswalk (in) is going to encourage safer crossing.”

The developers agreed to look into adding another crosswalk and warning signs cautioning motorists of potential pedestrian traffic.

The complex will be built on a grass field behind Gordon's Corner Shopping Center along Route 9. Coffee shops used car dealers a spa a hardware store and a vape shop are directly across from the site.

The apartments will be located less than half a mile from NJ Transit's Gordon's Corner bus stops.

If you're a regular Starbucks customer you'll be familiar with the coffee shop chain's 'pay it forward' scheme which involves paying for the drinks of the person behind you in the queue.

On the face of it it's a really lovely gesture and is of course designed to function as a small act of kindness which could make a person's day.

However it turns out that the scheme isn't all that popular when it comes to staff working in the store according to a former barista anyway.

Hannah Wilson who worked for the giant company for nearly seven years says the pay it forward chain is actually ""extremely annoying"" for people who are working.

""I just want to say publicly as a former Starbucks barista of nearly seven years since the current Starbucks employees can't say it"" she wrote in her public service announcement-style Facebook post.

""Pay it forward is extremely annoying and makes everything confusing. It makes it easy to hand out the wrong drinks and just sucks.""

Going into a little more detail about why the scheme sucks Hannah quite rightly pointed out that the people in the queue can likely afford their coffee or they wouldn't be in there in the first place.

""Instead of paying for the people behind you who can probably afford their own stuff since they're in line intending to pay tip the people making your drinks who have been understaffed for months"" she continued before concluding: ""Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk.""

There's no getting away from the fact she makes a valid point but not everyone agrees.

""As a former Starbucks employee this person sounds salty AF. It's really not that hard to keep up with and I loved when people would do it for others"" one person commented.

Meanwhile another added: ""That’s not quite the point of pay it forward. Not against tipping - but it’s just not the point.""

Starbucks the global coffee chain has made an event of season creep year after year with the release of its fall beverages most notably the pumpkin spice latte (or PSL for those in the know). The beverage itself is steeped in controversy. As Vox's Rebecca Jennings put it ""since its inception in 2003 the pumpkin spice latte has become something of a straw man for discussions about capitalism seasonal creep and the meaning of 'basic' resulting in widespread hatred for an otherwise innocuous beverage.""

However more than 200 million cups are sold annually and there tends to be a less-than-subtle undercurrent of misogyny to the PSL hate. Society as a whole has a problem with decrying the things many girls and women like — from musical artists to the entire genre of romance novels to feminine-coded coffee drinks — as vapid. But it's been a rough year and I don't want to talk about misogyny right now; I want to talk about milkshakes.

While Starbucks released their fall beverages on Aug. 24 this year (a day earlier than in 2020) I'm still in peak summer mode. It's still in the upper 80's and low 90's across large swaths of the U.S. and a steaming-hot cup of coffee is not on my radar.

That said the flavors — cinnamon ginger cloves cream and coffee — sounded pretty divine. I had baking spices in my pantry espresso powder on the counter and an unfinished pint of vanilla ice cream in the freezer. I thought ""Why not?"" After some trial and error I finally came up with the perfect PSL Milkshake a beverage to enjoy as the seasons continue to creep.

Goalie Caleb Fyock Commits to Ohio State,"(Photo Courtesy of St. John’s Lacrosse)

Nick Myers and the Ohio State Buckeyes kicked off the weekend with a bang landing a commitment from St. John’s goalie Caleb Fyock on Friday night. The junior is the second commitment in the 2023 class for the Buckeyes joining Western Reserve Academy (Ohio) D/LSM Aiden Bodonyi who was the first post-September 1st commitment in the class.

Fyock who is ranked as the No. 14 player in the class and rated as a five-star by Inside Lacrosse also considered Maryland Penn State and Syracuse before pulling the trigger on the Buckeyes. His commitment came during his visit to Columbus for the Buckeyes’ home opener football game this weekend.

“Ohio State has a family feel to it” Fyock told Lacrosse Bucket. “The players and coaches truly care about one another. It felt like home right when I stepped on campus.”

Nicknamed “Big Tasty” the 6-foot-1 265-pound goalie takes up much of the cage has some of the best hands you’ll see in high school lacrosse and has shown an ability to consistently make one impressive save after another. He anchored a St. John’s defense this spring that featured a trio of 2022 DI commits starting at close in Riley Figueiras (Syracuse) Richard Checo (Lehigh) and Thomas DeZio (Jacksonville) while helping the Cadets secure the title in the Washington D.C. championships and make the title game of the GEICO High School Nationals where they fell to Taft (Conn.). Fyock had 29 combined saves in their two contests of the event.

Fyock noted how his big body and quick hands help him tremendously in between the pipes and says many compare much of his style of play to that of former UAlbany star and current Chaos LC goalie Blaze Riorden.

The junior isn’t the first in his family to head to the Big Ten to play college lacrosse or find success at the goalie position. Fyock’s older brother Aleric is a redshirt junior at Penn State and likely to be in contention for the Nittany Lions’ starting goalie position this spring after starting in the final two games of the 2021 season.

Fyock says the benefit of having not only an only brother that plays lacrosse at the college level but also the same position as him has been huge. “My brother has been my best friend and biggest supporter” Fyock said. “He teaches me the ends and out of college shooters. We work together a lot in the summer and that really helps.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9tYXJrZXRzL2FwcGxlLWlwaG9uZS0xMy1pbmZsYXRpb24tZGF0YS1ibGlua2VuLWFmZ2hhbmlzdGFuLXdlZWstYWhlYWTSAWVodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3hidXNpbmVzcy5jb20vbWFya2V0cy9hcHBsZS1pcGhvbmUtMTMtaW5mbGF0aW9uLWRhdGEtYmxpbmtlbi1hZmdoYW5pc3Rhbi13ZWVrLWFoZWFkLmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Apple iPhone 13 inflation data and Blinken Afghanistan hearing top week ahead,"Fresh inflation data will have investors on pins and needles in the coming week after stocks ended Friday by notching a fifth day of losses and producer prices surging 8.3% annually — the most on record.

As Mayo count down to what could be one of the biggest days that the county would have seen in seventy years Lee Keegan will be one of the players hoping to help his home county land that elusive All-Ireland .

The pressure will be on Lee and the rest of the Mayo team as they face Tyrone in Croke Park today with Mayo hoping they can finally end their 70-year drought.

Mayo Career

The former 2016 Footballer of the Year plays for Westport as well as the Mayo team and also boasts the accolade of the highest scoring defender of all-time having clocked up 6–40 in 54 championship matches over his ten years on the team.

The defender didn't actually move to Mayo until his teenage years. His father is from Cheltenham while his mother is from Cavan.

Age

At 31 years of age Lee is one of the senior members of the Mayo team.

Day Job

He works full time as a Senior Validation Engineer at STERIS in his day job.

Relationship with Aoife Duffy and their Doolin wedding

The Mayo star tied the knot with his stunning long term girlfriend Aoife Duffy after 13 years in October 2019.

They chose Doolin Co Clare as the location for their special day with photos set against the dramatic background of the Burren and the Wild Atlantic Way.

Aoife wowed in a simple white gown with a long train and embellished neckline her long blonde hair falling in loose waves around her shoulders.

Lee donned an 'Elton' wine tuxedo jacket with matching waistcoat and contract black trousers.

Lee was joined at the altar by his groomsmen fellow Mayo GAA players Kevin McLoughlin and Kevin Keane and brother Phillip Keegan.

Other Mayo stars were also in attendance including Aidan O'Shea Rob Hennelly and Donal Vaughan.

Afterwards the couple jetted to Dubai for a luxury honeymoon.

Family Life

The footballer previously told RSVP Magazine that the love of his life Aoife gets on very well with his father who is from Cheltenham.

“They get on better together than we do and they talk to each other a lot"" he revealed.

""You need the people in the background to help you out and they are together at every game.

""There is no worry that they will argue or fall out with each other and if they do they can sort it out between themselves.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

After all there’s a nationwide downward trend in college football attendance and it would be natural for Nebraska to feel that effect.

Also it’s been speculated that people might stay away because of COVID-19 concerns. The university has mandated that face coverings be worn in indoor spaces at Memorial Stadium.

I decided to ask about that possibility in my pregame survey before Nebraska hosted Buffalo on a blistering hot Saturday afternoon. Obviously by asking people at a Nebraska football tailgate I would overwhelmingly find people who planned to attend the game but I thought maybe they at least know someone who is concerned enough about the pandemic to stay away from the stadium.

I spoke with 100 Husker fans in four different locations — at the Killigans’ performance outside the Cornhusker Hotel at the HuskerMax tailgate at 8th and N streets at the Railyard and at tailgates in parking lots between Pinnacle Bank Arena and Haymarket Park.

I asked this question: “Do you know anyone who is staying away from Husker football games today or in the future because of Memorial Stadium’s COVID-19 policy?”

An overwhelming 97 percent said no they didn’t know anyone who planned to stay away due to the stadium's COVID-19 policy. This is the most one-sided response I’ve ever had for a pregame survey.

Three percent answered “Yes” but two of them made it clear that they would stay away because they thought the policy is too strict.

Only one person said she knew someone who was staying away from the stadium because the policy is too lenient.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhaWwtd29ybGQuY29tL25ld3MvMjQxNjE5L01lZXQtdGhlLVN0cnlrZXItaW5mbGF0YWJsZS1ib2F0LWxpbmV1cNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Meet the Stryker inflatable boat lineup,"Meet the Stryker inflatable boat lineup

Soldiers with Fort Hood’s Rattler Troop 2nd Squadron 3d Cavalry Regiment trained on how to load three eight-wheeled 18-ton Stryker vehicles aboard the Air Force’s massive C-5M Galaxy as Airmen from Dover Air Force Base Del. trained how to chaining and securing the heavy gear so it wouldn’t come loose in flight.

This was the first time many of the 3d Cavalry Regiment soldiers had trained to load the four-engine transport plane.

The Air Force fleet’s largest aircraft the C-5 can carry Two hundred sixty thousand nine hundred ninety-eight or six greyhound buses.

“This exercise presents a fantastic opportunity for the 3d CavalryRegiment to rehearse the systems necessary to deploy anywhere the nation requires at a moment’s notice.” said Ltc. James Bithorn 2nd “Sabre” Squadron 3rd Cavalry Regiment.

He said the training “Deployment Readiness Exercise give units the unique opportunity to incorporate logistical assets across III Corps and Fort Hood and external agencies to prepare for a no-notice deployment anywhere in the world.”

CPT William Sherwood Rattler Troop commander2nd squadron 3d Cavalry Regiment said “The primary focus of the mission deployment readiness is to test our capabilities is our equipment maintained and ready to go at a moment’s notice.”

The Army started using Stryker vehicles in the 2000s which are lighter than M-1 tanks. They can be hauled by rail ship or by Air.

“The goal of Sabre Squadron is to be the squadron that’s ready to goat a moment’s notice and accomplish the mission for 3rd CavalryRegiment and the United States Army” said Sherwood.

Apple Fortnite trial ruling,"On Friday a California judge ruled on the influential Epic v. Apple lawsuit and both sides lost. Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers concluded that Apple wasn’t unfairly monopolizing the mobile app space with iOS or its in-app purchasing system and she ordered Epic to pay damages for violating its developer agreement with Fortnite. At the same time she ordered Apple to remove its anti-steering rules — policies banning developers from telling users about alternatives to Apple’s in-app purchase system.

For readers outside those two companies though Judge Gonzalez Rogers’ opinion has a lot to offer. Rogers clearly considers much of Epic and Apple’s behavior silly and many of both companies’ arguments bad. But she seriously examines all these arguments and lays out a blueprint for further legal arguments about mobile platforms app monopolies and modern antitrust law.

So we’re going to take a close look into the ruling’s biggest conclusions — and what they mean for both companies.

The Fortnite suit is about mobile game payments not iOS apps or the bigger game market

During the trial both sides argued over which market Fortnite’s iOS app belonged to. Epic claimed Apple had abused a monopoly on the iOS app ecosystem; Apple claimed Fortnite was playing in the more competitive overall digital game market. (This is why the trial’s lawyers kept asking whether Fortnite is a game.)

Judge Gonzalez Rogers says both these definitions are wrong although Apple’s is somewhat less wrong. Instead the question is whether Apple has an unlawful monopoly in “digital mobile gaming transactions.” Gonzalez Rogers notes that mobile games often have a different user base than PC or console games and they rely hugely on the “freemium” model of in-game item sales which are less important to both mobile apps and console or PC games.

Epic made 10 claims against Apple. Most of them depended significantly on Apple having an unfair monopoly under either the federal Sherman Antitrust Act or California’s antitrust-focused Cartwright Act. And although the ruling is sympathetic toward several of Epic’s underlying arguments nearly all its claims were dismissed.

Apple doesn’t have a monopoly in mobile gaming — yet

Mobile games are a huge part of Apple’s App Store revenue — approximately 70 percent according to the ruling — and Apple has outsized power in mobile gaming. Gonzalez Rogers concludes iOS and Android hold a near-duopoly although she considers the Nintendo Switch and cloud gaming services potential near-future competitors. The ruling estimates that Apple has a share of around 55 percent in the mobile game transactions market alongside “extraordinarily high profit margins” which can be a sign of monopoly power.

“Success is not illegal”

But despite Apple’s “considerable” power and profit margins “these factors alone do not show antitrust conduct. Success is not illegal” Gonzalez Rogers concludes. While Epic argued that iMessage and other factors deliberately lock users into iOS Gonzalez Rogers wasn’t convinced by this line of reasoning.

The ruling leaves the door open for future antitrust complaints. “The evidence does suggest that Apple is near the precipice of substantial market power or monopoly power with its considerable market share” Gonzalez Rogers writes. “Apple is only saved by the fact that its share is not higher that competitors from related submarkets are making inroads into the mobile gaming submarket and perhaps because [Epic] did not focus on this topic.”

For now though this judgment undercut Epic’s allegation that Apple maintained a monopoly or unlawfully restrained trade under the Sherman Act helping taking down four of its claims against Apple. The ruling says that by extension it means Apple didn’t violate California’s Cartwright Act taking down two more of the claims.

A seventh claim said iOS was an “essential facility” that Apple had unfairly denied access to. But Epic didn’t seriously argue this claim and for mobile app developers Gonzalez Rogers says web apps and other digital platforms provide a reasonable (if not ideal) distribution alternative.

The App Store has a troubling lack of competition

The Epic v. Apple ruling has some harsh words for the App Store. At one point Gonzalez Rogers notes that “nothing other than legal action seems to motivate Apple to reconsider pricing and reduce rates.” At other points she says Apple “does a poor job of mediating disputes between a developer and its customer” and it’s been “slow either to adopt automated tools that could improve speed and accuracy or to hire more reviewers” for its app review process. “Apple’s slow innovation stems in part from its low investment in the App Store” the ruling elaborates.

Meanwhile although Gonzalez Rogers takes a dim view of Epic’s economic analysis she accepts that “Apple’s operating margins tied to the App Store are extraordinarily high.” And she specifically calls out a lack of competition as an issue. “The point is not that ... Apple provides bad services. It does not” she writes. “The point is that a third-party app store could put pressure on Apple to innovate by providing features that Apple has neglected.”

Apple has valid security fears about opening up iOS

Apple’s trial witnesses promoted iOS as an unusually safe and secure ecosystem because of its walled-garden model saying no other option would be appropriate for the sensitive data on people’s phones. Epic called that claim a pretext for shutting down competition.

The ruling deflates some of Apple’s protestations. Judge Gonzalez Rogers is particularly dubious of Apple software engineering VP Craig Federighi who delivered a dramatic but suspiciously new denunciation of macOS malware. She’s generally receptive to Epic’s suggestion that Apple could review and notarize iOS apps for security but allow distribution through other sources similar to macOS. “Even though unrestricted app distribution likely decreases security alternative models are readily achievable to attain the same ends even if not currently employed” she concludes.

Gonzalez Rogers doesn’t think that makes Apple’s claims pretextual though. She agrees with Apple that comprehensive human review — which isn’t part of macOS notarization — can offer a “safe and trusted user experience” that’s actually pro-consumer. By contrast she says Epic’s proposed solutions “principally appear to eliminate app review.”

The ruling dashes Epic’s hope that Apple would legally have to allow sideloaded apps and third-party app stores on iOS — which was Apple’s worst-case scenario going into the trial.

Apple has a right to require its in-app payment options

As you might remember if you’ve been following Epic v. Apple this whole dispute started with in-app purchase (or IAP) payment processing. Epic tweaked Fortnite on iOS so that players could buy in-game V-Bucks via two methods: the Apple App Store or an “Epic direct payment” with a 20 percent discount.

Epic’s “Direct Pay” option on Fortnite for iOS August 2020

Epic described Apple’s IAP system as a glorified payment processor with outsized fees and it argued that Apple was illegally tying IAP to the overall App Store. In Epic’s view developers should be able to offer multiple payment processing options or reject Apple’s payment system altogether.

This is a big point of dissatisfaction among major app developers and Friday’s ruling isn’t terribly promising for them.

Gonzalez Rogers is skeptical of some Apple arguments for its current locked-down system and the attendant 30 percent — for big companies like Epic — commission. (Dunking on both sides’ expert witness analysis is a running theme in her ruling.) She also notes there’s “no evidence that IAP provides developers with any unique features” compared to standard payment processing. But she’s fairly straightforwardly opposed to making Apple unbundle the system calling Epic’s request for it “deficient.”

Throughout the trial Apple has said that it’s not simply charging for payment processing on IAP. It’s using it to collect a commission — the 15 or 30 percent so-called “Apple Tax” — on the larger value of the App Store. Epic disputed that Apple meaningfully earned that commission saying that although the App Store connects (in its words “matches”) users with developers Apple doesn’t deserve a cut of every transaction that happens after that.

Apple and Epic argued over how much the in-app purchase system actually benefits developers

The ruling says the matching description is “partially true” but that Apple has “never argued that it levies a commission merely because it matches the developers with the customers.” Instead “IAP is the method by which Apple collects its licensing fee from developers for the use of Apple’s intellectual property.”

Gonzalez Rogers admittedly finds “no basis” for the specific 30 percent rate despite Apple hiring a consultant to testify about the value of its patents. (As mentioned previously the ruling is full of dunks on the expert witnesses.) But she says Apple is still entitled to license that intellectual property for a fee of some sort and requiring developers to use Apple’s payment system “accomplishes this goal in the easiest and most direct manner.”

Epic’s unbundling alternative meanwhile would “severely undermine” the system says the ruling. “Indeed to the extent Epic Games suggests that Apple receive nothing from in-app purchases made on its platform such a remedy is inconsistent with prevailing intellectual property law.”

Gonzalez Rogers’ conclusion is another reason Epic didn’t prevail on the monopoly maintenance or restraint of trade claims discussed above since two of them specifically dealt with IAP. She also says IAP isn’t a standalone product so Apple isn’t illegally tying it to the App Store which nixes two more Sherman and Cartwright Act claims.

For those keeping score that’s nine claims down for Epic. But there’s one final claim that makes this ruling a significant thorn in Apple’s side. Let’s talk about it.

iOS developers have a right to talk about alternatives

Gonzalez Rogers concludes that Apple doesn’t monopolize mobile gaming. But the company does violate California’s Unfair Competition Law (UCL) through its anti-steering rules: policies that restrict developers from telling users they can buy digital goods outside Apple’s ecosystem. The ruling focuses on this portion of Apple’s developer agreement:

“Apps and their metadata may not include buttons external links or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than in-app purchase.”

Gonzalez Rogers has almost unreserved scorn for this policy. “By employing anti-steering provisions consumers do not know what developers may be offering on their websites including lower prices” she writes. Developers are allowed to email customers to advertise but only through addresses they’ve collected outside the iOS signup process which consumers also don’t necessarily know.

Users don’t necessarily even know about the cut Apple is taking — that “if they subscribe to their favorite newspaper on the web” for instance “all the proceeds go to the newspaper rather than the reduced amount by subscribing on the iOS device.” Some people appreciate that Apple offers a unified place to manage subscriptions. But others might not and “Apple actively denies them the choice” to find alternatives.

“Apple created a new and innovative platform which was also a black box”

“Apple created a new and innovative platform which was also a black box. It enforced silence to control information and actively impede users from obtaining the knowledge to obtain digital goods on other platforms” Gonzalez Rogers concludes. “Apple has used this lack of knowledge to exploit its position.”

The ruling says Apple’s situation is “distinctly different” from another case that let American Express use anti-steering rules for brick-and-mortar merchants because even in that scenario merchants can still say they also accept Visa and MasterCard.

Accordingly a new injunction will soon prevent Apple from banning “buttons external links or other calls to action” that direct users to other payment mechanisms. That’s potentially a big deal for Apple... although it’s not yet clear just how big a deal.

Apple could collect an ‘Apple Tax’ even without in-app payment charges

As my colleague Nilay Patel discusses Judge Gonzalez Rogers’ injunction leaves some weird ambiguity about what developers can do. In theory a developer could add a button that directs users to Safari or another app for payment but looks indistinguishable from the option to pay with Apple’s system. (It’s worth noting the injunction doesn’t say Apple has to let developers build complete alternate payment methods into their apps and based on the statements quoted earlier Gonzalez Rogers seems fairly down on that prospect.)

But developers like Epic don’t just care about controlling payment methods out of principle — although it offers some unique benefits like getting to handle refunds. They care about ditching Apple’s 30 percent commission. And Gonzalez Rogers says bluntly that it’s not that simple.

Even if developers could entirely stop using the IAP system “Apple could still charge a commission on developers. It would simply be more difficult for Apple to collect that commission” Gonzalez Rogers writes. The ruling elaborates on this scenario — in which Apple is outright banned from making developers use its payment option — in a footnote:

“In such a hypothetical world developers could potentially avoid the commission while benefitting from Apple’s innovation and intellectual property free of charge. The Court presumes that in such circumstances that Apple may rely on imposing and utilizing a contractual right to audit developers annual accounting to ensure compliance with its commissions among other methods. Of course any alternatives to IAP (including the foregoing) would seemingly impose both increased monetary and time costs to both Apple and the developers.”

The law now says that Apple can’t stop developers from offering cheaper prices outside their iOS apps and telling users about it. But if big developers successfully route a lot of money away from the App Store this way Gonzalez Rogers seemingly leaves the door open to collecting the “Apple Tax” some other way.

Epic and Apple’s contract was valid and Epic knowingly broke it

The Epic v. Apple ruling declares that part of Apple’s developer agreement (called the DPLA) is unlawful... but Epic still has to pay for breaking it with the Fortnite payment system change. By the same token Apple doesn’t have to restore Fortnite or keep Epic’s other apps on iOS if it doesn’t agree to follow Apple’s rules. Why?

The first reason is basically that Apple’s agreement didn’t break the law enough. Epic claimed the contract was “illegal and unenforceable” because it violated the Sherman Act the Cartwright Act and the UCL. Gonzalez Rogers concludes that the single UCL offense wasn’t sufficiently related or severe to justify Epic’s rulebreaking. She also dismisses the claim that Apple’s contract was “unconscionable” — in other words one-sided enough to “shock the conscience.” (“These are billion and trillion dollar companies with a business dispute” the ruling notes dryly.)

The second reason is that Epic broke another rule in the process. It hid the alternate payment system inside a remote “hotfix” when Apple’s policies said it couldn’t “provide unlock or enable additional features or functionality through distribution mechanisms other than the App Store.” That specific provision wasn’t related to antitrust claims and the ruling concludes Epic “never showed why it had to breach its agreements” to challenge Apple’s alleged anti-competitive actions.

We still don’t know what a game is

Sure all the questions above are legally relevant and important for consumers and set a detailed precedent for future antitrust legislation and lawsuits. But let’s end with the fun part: after all the time witnesses spent arguing about what a video game is does the ruling give us a definition?

The short answer is no because it doesn’t have to. “The court need not reach a conclusive definition of a video game or game because by all accounts Fortnite itself is both externally and internally considered a video game.” Fortnite markets itself as a game and even if CEO Tim Sweeney considers it the basis for a larger metaverse (in case you were wondering “the court generally finds Mr. Sweeney’s personal beliefs about the future of the metaverse are sincerely held”) the metaverse as a product “remains in its infancy.”

As for the definitions introduced by witnesses “unfortunately no one agrees and neither side introduced evidence of any commonly accepted industry definition.” That includes Sweeney’s claim that a game “involves some sort of win or loss or a score progression” as well as Apple app review head Trystan Kosmynka’s claim that “games have a beginning [and] an end” and “there’s challenges in place.”

Gonzalez Rogers does however spend a surprising amount of time breaking down the core elements of a video game. Here’s a brief definition:

“The court concludes that video games include a diverse and eclectic genre of games that are tied together at minimum through varying degrees of interactivity and involvement from a game player.”

There’s also a more elaborate one:

“At a bare minimum video games appear to require some level of interactivity or involvement between the player and the medium. In other words a game requires that a player be able to input some level of a command or choice which is then reflected in the game itself. This gaming definition contrasts to other forms of entertainment which are often passive forms enjoyed by consumers (e.g. films television music). Video games are also generally graphically rendered or animated as opposed to being recorded live or via motion capture as in films and television.”

You could certainly quibble with elements of this and Gonzalez Rogers admits she’s not clarifying the “outer boundaries of the definition of video games.” She declines to say whether specific non-Epic titles like Roblox and Netflix’s Black Mirror: Bandersnatch are games. She also says she can’t conclude whether certain games on the Itch.io storefront were sexually explicit or problematic given that “the corresponding materials ... were not submitted to the court” — although she does offer a ruling on naked banana man decorum.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vbm9raWFtb2IubmV0LzIwMjEvMDkvMTIvbm9raWEtbW9iaWxlLXRvLWxhdW5jaC10d28tbmV3LXBob25lcy1uMTM5ZGwtYW5kLW4xMzc0ZGwtd2l0aC10cmFjZm9uZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nokia Mobile to launch two new phones N139DL and N1374DL with TracFone,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 423 Client Error:  for url: https://nokiamob.net/2021/09/12/nokia-mobile-to-launch-two-new-phones-n139dl-and-n1374dl-with-tracfone/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vbm9raWFtb2IubmV0LzIwMjEvMDkvMTIvbm9raWEtbW9iaWxlLXRvLWxhdW5jaC10d28tbmV3LXBob25lcy1uMTM5ZGwtYW5kLW4xMzc0ZGwtd2l0aC10cmFjZm9uZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

The mods in question are TF2Classic and Open Fortress. The former does what it says on the tin plus the integration of modes and features that were deleted from the earlier versions of the game as well as new bits and bobs. The latter is the work of hundreds of modders that have added new modes characters story content and more under the umbrella of the existing Team Fortress 2 universe.

Ergo these creations are extremely beloved by the community and initially it's concerning that Valve looks to have come after their efforts. Except that's not exactly what has happened not like Take-Two Interactive's reaction to those spiffy Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and Vice City mods.

Watch how the Steam Deck works in a handy-dandy video below featuring the power of the AMD eight thread Zen 2 CPU and its silly button placements.

Take a note of the wording of the two announcements from the two teams behind the two mods. There's an ""arrangement"" with Valve that has led to the ""temporary"" halt to downloads of the creations by the general public. The developers behind TF2Classic and Open Fortress will share more in the future but these statements don't seem to be suggesting that they're in trouble with Valve.





So it's possible that Valve is interested in closely collaborating with these modders for an upcoming update to Team Fortress 2. Even though the game was released almost 13 years ago it's still one of the most popular titles on Steam. At the time of writing it's sitting in the top ten amongst Grand Theft Auto V Rust New World Naraka: Bladepoint and other heavy hitters.

GladiatorDragon on Reddit has a theory that I think is pretty likely regarding why these mods have only been removed for a limited time. ""Implementation to Steam maybe? Valve definitely has a heck of a lot more respect for mods and modders than most other devs"" they said. Watch this space I suppose.

Or follow us on Google News

When I was on a podcast with Connecticut State Senator Will Haskell and Will Cross from Tesla Owners Club of Connecticut the senator said something that helped me understand exactly why dealerships are fighting so hard against Tesla and other EV manufacturers.

Senator Haskell pointed out that dealers feel as if they have the superior business model and that customers love going to dealerships.

“I personally don’t think that that’s true. I think that they are not necessarily in love with the car dealership experience but maybe they’re right. And the point of living in a free market is allowing the customer to decide. If dealerships truly believe that they’re serving customers in a superior way; that they’re the preferable option well then customers will likely continue to choose to buy their car at dealerships even if direct sales is an option.

“But by restricting the free market I find it sort of confusing. It’s like the world is turned upside down. I’m a progressive democrat in Connecticut begging to allow businesses to come to Connecticut and to enable free market dynamics to do what they do best which is empower the consumer to make a choice that’s best for them.”

While listening to Senator Haskell’s remarks my mind went back to that article by The Day that was practically begging Tesla to give up on direct sales in Connecticut. In that article the editorial board wrote an op-ed that emphasized the desire of dealers and their supporters for Tesla to play by the dealership’s rules — the law as it stands referring to the current state law that bans direct sales of EVs in Connecticut.

It’s About Control

And then it clicked. The reason why dealerships don’t want to compete with Tesla or any EV manufacture that sells directly to the customer is that they don’t want to have to fight for something they are used to getting easily.

Up until Tesla the only way to buy a car was through a dealership. With Tesla and other EV manufacturers such as Rivian and Lucid coming to the States dealerships are now having to fight or compete for something they are not used to having to fight for. They have to fight for their piece of the pie so to speak.

Before Tesla dealerships could get away with screwing customers over because if you wanted a car you literally had no choice but to go to a dealership (unless you bought a used car from someone). If you wanted a new car you go to the dealers. It’s always been this way.

Dealerships Would Rather Sue Tesla Than Compete For Customers

Many dealerships across the U.S. and their associated groups are lobbying state governments to ban Tesla and other automakers from selling directly to customers. In Connecticut Hoffman Auto Group is suing Tesla because Tesla is opening a service center (where it will service the vehicles not sell them) for its customers.

The dealership claimed that it is suing Tesla because Tesla will be allowed to open a facility and do business with its customers. In other words the dealership is suing Tesla because it doesn’t want to compete with Tesla for customers. Imagine if Samsung sued Apple because it has to compete for customers.

Dealers Don’t Want The Status Quo To Change

The dealer model was the only way a customer could buy a new car. Until Tesla. Senator Haskell also mentioned that in his state there was a poll that showed enabling direct sales in Connecticut was an extremely popular idea. The poll which took place earlier this year had high support — somewhere between 70% to 89% of residents supported the direct sales bill.

“That’s shocking because 88% of residents agree on nothing but the fact that they think that EVs should be allowed to compete in a free-market manner I think is really encouraging. Support was strong among the Democratic Party and the Republican Party but what struck me most and this gets gets to your point about car dealerships support was highest among women and among people of color. And I that that’s not a coincidence. It’s because those are two groups that consistently face higher prices and other forms of discrimination at car dealerships.

“So the car dealership model which has existed for many many decades — almost a century — it doesn’t work for everybody. The status quo isn’t working for everybody and that is why I think this bill is so popular especially among those groups.”

When Tesla listed the refreshed Model S and Model X in its online configurator earlier this year the company made it a point to indicate a number of key features that are coming to the flagship sedan and SUV. These include a swiveling display which would allow drivers and passengers to tilt the vehicles’ large 17″ screen towards themselves.

There are some advantages offered by a tilting display. Tesla Theater would likely be more enjoyable as will other entertainment features like Caraoke and Tesla Arcade. As the Model S Plaid’s first deliveries neared however Tesla implemented updates on its online configurator in May suggesting that the tilting display was being retired.

Tesla owners who took deliveries of their Model S Plaid and Model S Long Range reported that their cars’ displays did not have any swiveling functions. This seemed to confirm the updated information from Tesla’s official website. However a recent sighting of a Model S refresh has suggested that the tilting screen feature may still be coming in the near future.

Photos taken of the recently-sighted Model S refresh clearly show a vehicle with a display that is capable of swiveling from left to right. The Model S was fitted with manufacturer plates too which indicates that the vehicle was really from the company. The tilting mechanism was exposed in the Model S but it does seem to go pretty well with the vehicle’s overall look.

Tesla has not explained why it removed some of the new Model S and Model X’s initially listed functions though speculations among EV owners point to the ongoing supply chain issues and chip shortage as the likely culprits for the flagship cars’ reduced features. With parts at a premium after all Tesla would likely use the components it could get for its vehicles’ most pivotal features.

Reports from the EV community have claimed that the tilting mechanism is still present in newer Model S and that the vehicles are only missing the motors and guide pins necessary for the feature. Other reports from the online electric vehicle community suggest that the new Model S being shipped today still has wires and light tubes in their door panels. This suggests that the flagship sedan might still get ambient lighting features in the future possibly through a simple retrofit.

The title says that 0-60 mph is possible in 1.95 seconds but the Dragy indicate results above 2.1 seconds.

Anyway we have an interesting data point of how valuable 140 pounds (over 63 kg) is which might be saved by the manufacturer in the future in the production version.

The Dallas Education Foundation is the direct non-profit philanthropic partner of Dallas ISD with a mission of inspiring community investment to accelerate student success.

The campaign theme — the Heart of Teaching — is a tribute to the 10000+ teachers in Dallas ISD and an opportunity to recognize the talents of our Dallas ISD art educators a majority of whom are working artists.

Every day Dallas ISD art teachers share their gifts with our students and encourage lift and enable them to do more than they thought possible. An art exhibition of nearly 60 of Dallas ISD teacher-artists will be open for viewing at the Music Hall at Fair Park during the State Fair of Texas. Admission is complimentary with valid admission to the Fair.

“The Heart of Teaching is a collaboration between the Dallas Education Foundation Dallas ISD and the Dallas Summer Musicals” said Devon Miller Director of Education and Community Partnerships at Dallas Summer Musicals. “It will be the first-ever teacher visual arts showcase hosted at the Music Hall during the run of the State Fair.

“The culmination of the exhibition will be an evening of drinks and dessert reception on October 25 2021 in the Crystal Terrace at the Music Hall at Fair Park.”

All artwork will be available for purchase with bidding starting on the opening day of the State Fair and closing at the Oct 25 evening event. All proceeds support the Dallas Education Foundation as they work to fund equity-minded programming district-wide.

“Our educators have a heart for teaching and we are incredibly appreciative to have the opportunity to elevate our Dallas ISD art teachers with this exhibit” said Mita Havlick Executive Director of the Dallas Education Foundation. “The foundation’s positive impact is deep and the exhibition along with the evening reception is the perfect launch to the foundation’s annual campaign.”

Dallas ISD was recently named a 2021 District of Distinction by the Texas Art Education Association – one of only 40 out of 1110 districts across the State.

“Dallas ISD is the largest district to ever be awarded this honor.” says Monica Hayslip Dallas ISD Director of Visual Arts “We have an art program on every campus and nearly 300 art teachers in the district. Each one of them is credited with us being named a District of Distinction.”

Atmos Energy is serving as the Heart of Teaching’s title museum sponsor with the Addy Foundation the Dallas Mavericks Grand Canyon University and Texas Instruments as the additional major sponsors.

“We know that the Dallas Education Foundation does a fantastic job of advocating for our students and for Dallas ISD” said Jonathan Fredi Manager of Public Affairs at Atmos Energy. “You have to educate the whole child and you cannot leave out art. Through our Fueling Safe and Thriving Communities program we want to give our Dallas ISD students every opportunity to succeed.”

“The gallery exhibition and evening reception are only possible through a partnership with Dallas Summer Musicals and the support of Atmos Energy and all of our sponsors” Havlick said. “They know that together we power the future of Dallas – our students.”

We have incorporated innovative and next generation technologies that enhance the flying experience for an already proven aircraft.”

Renowned for their versatility and reliability King Air turboprops have been a popular choice across Europe with more than 460 aircraft throughout the region. Nearly half of all King Airs in Europe are owned and operated in France Germany and the United Kingdom. A typical King Air 360 flight with four passengers and a single pilot has a maximum range of 3345 km (1806 nautical miles) allowing it to complete flights such as London to Athens or Frankfurt to Moscow without stopping to refuel. Similarly the King Air 260 has a maximum range of 3185 km (1720 nautical miles) allowing four passengers and a single pilot to take complete flights such as Rome to Madrid or Paris to Stockholm without refuelling.

The King Air 360/360ER and 260 models represent the next generation of the legendary King Air turboprop family building on its reputation of versatility and reliability. The aircraft offer the latest technological advancements in the cockpit along with providing additional comfort to the passenger experience.

The King Air 360/360ER turboprop features the addition of the Innovative Solutions & Support (IS&S) ThrustSense Autothrottle. The autothrottle supports pilots in their critical mission of delivering people or cargo by automatically managing engine power from the takeoff roll through the climb cruise descent and go-around phases of flight.

Another key addition to the cockpit is a digital pressurisation controller which automatically schedules cabin pressurisation during both climb and descent reducing pilot workload and increasing overall passenger comfort. The aircraft also has a lower cabin altitude at the aircraft’s certified ceiling of 35000 feet providing greater comfort for passengers especially during longer flights.

The King Air 260 is also equipped with the IS&S ThrustSense Autothrottle system as well as digital cabin pressurisation. The aircraft now also features the Collins Multi-Scan RTA-4112 weather radar providing pilots with a fully automatic system that is optimised to detect short mid and long-range weather.

The new King Air turboprops were introduced in 2020 with the Beechcraft King Air 360/360ER achieving U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification in October 2020 and the King Air 260 in March 2021.

vIRF-1 localizes in part to mitochondria by targeting to the detergent-resistant microdomains (DRM) [21]. To examine the role of mitochondrial DRM (mDRM)-localized vIRF-1 we sought to identify vIRF-1-interacting mDRM proteins from the TRExBCBL-1-RTA (hereafter simply termed iBCBL-1) cell line which is an HHV-8-infected primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) cell line with doxycycline (Dox)-inducible expression of RTA a lytic switch protein [25]. Due to poor solubility of mDRM proteins in standard lysis buffer we performed Far-western blotting instead of a co-precipitation method (Fig. 1A). Five distinct individual dots (Fig. 1B) highly reactive with vIRF-1-T7 compared to control EGFP-T7 were found and the corresponding spots were excised from a replica gel for mass spectrometry analysis. One of the spots was identified as TUFM (Fig. S1).

Fig. 1: vIRF-1 binds directly to TUFM. A Workflow of Far-western blotting using the mitochondrial detergent-resistant microdomains (mDRM) isolated from iBCBL-1 cells treated with Dox for 2 days. B Two-dimensional (2D) separation of mDRM proteins and Far-western blotting using purified vIRF-1-T7 or EGFP-T7 protein. The third gel was stained with Coomassie blue. vIRF-1-reactive dots are marked by red circles on the Far-western blot and stained gel. As identified by mass spectrometry: dot 1 ATP synthase γ; dot 2 tubulin polymerization promoting protein 3 (TPPP3); dot 3 unidentified; dot 4 trifunctional enzyme subunit β and dot 5 elongation factor Tu (TUFM). C Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) pull-down (PD) assay. Purified vIRF-1-T7 protein (250 ng) was incubated with GST GST-TUFM or GST-TPPP3 which were precipitated with glutathione beads. vIRF-1 and GST/GST-fusion proteins were detected by anti-vIRF-1 and -GST antibodies respectively. Asterisks indicate GST and GST-fusion proteins of expected size. D Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) of endogenous TUFM with vIRF-1. Mitochondrial extracts derived from lytic iBCBL-1 cells (Dox treatment for 2 days) were immunoprecipitated with pre-immune rabbit immunoglobulin (nIgG) or anti-vIRF-1 antibody and then the precipitated complexes were immunoblotted with anti-TUFM or vIRF-1 antibody. E Indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) to assess co-localization of vIRF-1 and TUFM. HeLa.Kyoto cells were transiently co-transfected with vIRF-1 and TUFM-V5 in the presence or absence of Flag-MAVS for 24 h and immunostained with anti-vIRF-1 and -V5 antibodies. Note that the cells were permeabilized with 25 µg/ml of saponin for 5 min prior to fixation to diffuse out free vIRF-1 from the cytoplasm thereby facilitating detection of mitochondria-bound vIRF-1 (see also Fig. S2). Intriguingly the cell preparation enabled us to avoid detection of nuclear-localized vIRF-1 indicating that the mild detergent saponin could not permeabilize the nuclear envelope. The effect of MAVS on co-localization was analyzed using Coloc2 (ImageJ); the median Pearson’s correlation coefficients are 0.5339 and 0.6961 without and with MAVS respectively. Scale bar 10 µm. F Co-IP assay of vIRF-1-TUFM association. Total-cell extracts derived from 293T cultures co-transfected with vIRF-1 and TUFM-V5 in the presence or absence of Flag-MAVS for 24 h were immunoprecipitated with normal goat immunoglobulin (nIgG negative control) or anti-V5 antibody and then the precipitated complexes or lysates (input) were immunoblotted with anti-vIRF-1 V5 or Flag antibody. The relative intensities (RI) of coprecipitated vIRF-1 protein normalized to the immunoprecipitated TUFM-V5 are indicated. G Co-IP assay in wild-type (WT) and MAVS KO 293T cells transfected with the indicated plasmids. H Co-IP assay in 293T cells transfected with the indicated plasmids. Full size image

An in vitro pull-down assay confirmed the direct interactions of vIRF-1 with TUFM and TPPP3 another hit protein (Fig. 1C). Furthermore a co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assay showed that vIRF-1 interacted with endogenous TUFM on mitochondria isolated from lytic iBCBL-1 cells (Fig. 1D). In addition an immunofluorescence assay (IFA) showed that vIRF-1 co-localized with TUFM in transfected HeLa.Kyoto cells and their co-localization was promoted by overexpression of MAVS (Fig. 1E) which was reported previously to promote the mitochondrial targeting of vIRF-1 [21]. Consistent with this co-IP assays showed that vIRF-1 interaction with TUFM was promoted by MAVS overexpression and greatly diminished by MAVS deficiency (Fig. 1F G). However vIRF-1 interaction with MAVS was not affected by TUFM overexpression (Fig. 1H) indicating that TUFM and MAVS interactions with vIRF-1 are not mutually exclusive.

TUFM depletion potentiates apoptosis in lytic vIRF-1-deficient cells

Mitochondria-localized vIRF-1 plays a crucial role for survival of lytically infected cells [17 21]. So we examined whether TUFM is involved in vIRF-1 regulation of cell survival using four different iBCBL-1 cell lines expressing Dox-inducible vIRF-1 and/or TUFM shRNAs (Fig. 2A). Luciferase shRNA (shLuc) was used as a control. Note that both lytic reactivation and shRNA expression are induced simultaneously by Dox treatment in the cell lines. Dox-inducible knockdown (KD) of TUFM and vIRF-1 proteins was verified using immunoblotting (Fig. 2A). As expected vIRF-1-KD resulted in reduced numbers of iBCBL-1 cells after 4 days of Dox treatment (Fig. 2B). TUFM-KD also led to a significant decrease in numbers of shLuc and vIRF-1-KD lytic cells (Fig. 2B). To determine if the reduced numbers of TUFM-depleted lytic cells were associated with increased cell death we counted the number of dead cells using a trypan blue exclusion assay. TUFM depletion indeed increased the proportion of dead cells within cultures of both cell lines shLuc and shvIRF-1 during lytic replication; however cell death was induced earlier in the vIRF-1-KD cells compared to in the shLuc cells (Fig. 2C). Overall these results suggest that both vIRF-1 and TUFM are important for the survival of lytically infected cells.

Fig. 2: TUFM depletion potentiates apoptosis induced by vIRF-1 depletion. A Immunoblots of total-cell extracts derived from iBCBL-1 cells that were stably transduced with the indicated shRNAs and then left untreated or treated with 1 µg/ml Dox for 4 days to induce lytic replication. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was used as a loading control. The iBCBL-1 cell lines were incubated with or without Dox for the indicated days and cell proliferation and viability were measured using cell counting (B) and trypan blue exclusion (C D) assays. Necrostatin-1 (Nec-1 30 µM) the pan-caspase inhibitors zVAD-FMK (20 µM) and Emricasan (10 µM) z-DEVD-FMK (inhibitor of caspase-3 iCASP3 2 µM) and z-IETD-FMK (inhibitor of caspase-8 iCASP8 2 µM) were added to the cultures 2 days after Dox treatment (D). Particular datasets (bracketed) were analyzed by t-test for statistical significance. E The iBCBL-1 cell lines were left untreated or treated with Dox for 4 days and analyzed for apoptosis by annexin V staining and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL). The proportion of apoptotic cells within each population was determined using an automated cell counter (Nexcelom) and the data were analyzed using FCS Express 6 software. M1 indicates the percentages of apoptotic cells. The total-cell extracts and cytosolic fractions derived from the iBCBL-1 cell lines left untreated or treated with Dox for 3 days were used for immunoblotting analyses of PARP cleavage (F) and cytochrome c release (G). The relative band intensities of cleaved PARP (cPARP) and cytochrome c normalized to LDH are noted under the corresponding bands. H Measurement of mitochondrial superoxide. The iBCBL-1 cell lines left untreated or treated with Dox for 3 days were incubated with 5 µM MitoSOX red reagent in Hank’s balanced salt solution. MitoSOX-positive cells were counted using the automated cell counter. The data present the mean ± SD of triplicate experiments. For B–D H: *p < 0.05 **p < 0.01 ***p < 0.001 and ns not significant.

We next determined the type of cell death promoted by TUFM depletion. Pan-caspase inhibitors zVAD-FMK and Emricasan but neither DMSO nor the necroptosis inhibitor Necrostatin-1 inhibited cell death induced by TUFM-KD in lytic vIRF-1-KD cells (Fig. 2D). Specific inhibitors of caspase-8 (CASP8) and caspase-3 (CASP3) also inhibited the TUFM-KD-induced cell death (Fig. 2D) indicating that TUFM depletion is associated with caspase-dependent apoptosis. Indeed TUFM-KD significantly promoted apoptosis in lytic vIRF-1-KD cells as evidenced by Annexin V TUNEL and PARP cleavage assays (Fig. 2E F). Moreover TUFM-KD potentiated cytochrome c release to the cytosol in the vIRF-1-KD cells (Fig. 2G) suggesting that TUFM could inhibit mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. TUFM deficiency could lead to reduced mitochondrial respiratory activity and promote the production of ROS which are probably involved in causing apoptosis. Indeed mitochondrial superoxide was elevated significantly by TUFM-KD in not only lytic vIRF-1-KD but also lytic control cells (Fig. 2H). However TUFM depletion-induced oxidative stress is unlikely to be involved directly in apoptosis initiation because TUFM depletion alone was not sufficient to induce apoptosis (Fig. 2E–G). Together these results suggest that TUFM may play a key and direct role in the inhibition of apoptosis in vIRF-1-deficient cells after lytic reactivation.

TUFM inhibits CASP8 activation induced by dysregulated mitochondria

To define the mechanism of apoptosis promoted by TUFM depletion we first examined caspase activation. Immunoblotting revealed that TUFM-KD promoted CASP8 activation as evidenced by increased levels of the p41/43 fragments of CASP8 in lytic vIRF-1-KD cells but not in lytic control cells (Fig. 3A). CASP3 was also activated but to a lesser extent (Fig. 3A). However the levels of MCL-1 a key regulator of PEL cell survival [26] were not affected by depletion of either vIRF-1 or TUFM. Importantly rescue with an shRNA-resistant version of TUFM substantially reduced CASP8 activation in lytic vIRF-1/TUFM-double-KD (dKD) cells (lane 8 in Fig. 3B). These results suggest that TUFM plays a key role in the inhibition of CASP8-mediated apoptosis induced by vIRF-1 deficiency.

Fig. 3: TUFM suppresses CASP8 activation induced by vIRF-1 depletion. A Immunoblots of total-cell extracts derived from the indicated iBCBL-1 cell lines that were left untreated or treated with 1 µg/ml Dox for 3 days. CASP8 cleavage products p41/43 (marked by the red dotted rectangle) in the different extracts were quantified relative to each other after normalization to LDH; the values are provided below the CASP8 blot. In addition the relative levels of the cleavage fragment (cCASP3) of CASP3 detected by antibody specific to cleaved CASP3 were determined as above and noted under the blot. B Immunoblots of total-cell extracts of the iBCBL-1 cell lines transduced with empty lentiviruses (EV) or lentivirus expressing TUFM-Flag and 1 day later treated with Dox for 3 days. The relative levels of the p41/43 fragments of CASP8 are noted under the blot. C Detection of CASP8 activity using SR-FLICA® CASP8 (C8-FLICA) reagent in vIRF-1 KD or vIRF-1/TUFM dKD lytic iBCBL-1 cells treated with Dox for 3 days. After C8-FLICA staining the cells were subjected to TOM20-IFA and DAPI nuclear staining. Scale bar 15 µm. D Determination of the percentages of cells with altered mitochondria. Images were taken of four random fields for each culture: vIRF-1 KD (n = 570) and vIRF-1/TUFM dKD (n = 472). In addition the percentage of C8-FLICA-negative or positive cells among cells showing altered mitochondria was determined. Statistical significance of vIRF-1 KD vs vIRF-1/TUFM dKD in C8 FLICA-negative or -positive cells was determined using student t-test. **p < 0.01; ns not significant. E The fluorescence intensities of TOM20 and C8-FLICA were measured in the cells with altered mitochondria above vIRF-1 KD (n = 27) and vIRF-1/TUFM dKD (n = 47) using ImageJ software and background-corrected integrated densities (IntDen) were plotted along with an arbitrary threshold (dotted blue line) of 10000. F Functional relationship between altered mitochondria and CASP8 activation in the context of apoptosis. A representative image showing vIRF-1/TUFM dKD cells with either C8-FLICA (red dotted circle) or altered mitochondria (green dotted circle) or both (white dotted circle) after lytic reactivation is presented along with a DAPI image. White arrow indicates co-localization of C8-FLICA and mitochondria. Apoptosis was assessed by nuclear condensation (green arrow) or fragmentation (blue arrow). Scale bar 10 µm. The chart shows the percentage of apoptotic vIRF-1 KD or vIRF-1/TUFM dKD cells with both C8-FLICA and altered mitochondria. It is noteworthy that the few cells (<0.1%) that are TOM20-negative and not nucleus-fragmented still showed CASP8 activation supporting a requirement for mitochondria in CASP8-mediated apoptosis. G Immunoblots of mitochondrial extracts of the iBCBL-1 cell lines left untreated or treated with 1 µg/ml Dox for 3 days. HSP60 was used as a mitochondrial-protein loading control. The relative levels of the p41/43 fragments normalized to HSP60 are noted under the blot. H C8-FLICA assays in control (shLuc) and TUFM KD iBCBL-1 cell lines lentivirally transduced with EV or Flag-tagged DRP1K38A. The transduced cells were treated with or without Dox for 2 days stained with C8-FLICA reagent and subjected to Flag-IFA (Fig. S5). The percent of C8-FLICA-positive cells were determined and depicted in the graph. The data present the mean ± SD of three different images. *p < 0.05; ***p < 0.001. “n” indicates the total-cell numbers counted. I Immunoblots of cell extracts of the indicated shRNA-expressing HeLa.Kyoto cell lines left untreated or treated with 50 ng/ml of TRAIL and/or 20 µM mdivi-1 for 6 h.

As TUFM is implicated in mitophagy activation upon infection by certain RNA viruses [15 27] we postulated that TUFM-KD leads to excessive accumulation of dysregulated mitochondria and thereby potentiates apoptosis in vIRF-1-deficient cells. To test this we examined mitochondria using TOM20-IFA. The number of cells with both highly clustered mitochondria and apoptotic nuclei (fragmented or condensed chromatin) greatly increased in the vIRF-1/TUFM-dKD cells compared to vIRF-1-KD cells after lytic reactivation (Fig. S3). Emricasan inhibited nuclear fragmentation but not mitochondrial aggregation (Fig. S4) suggesting that mitochondrial aggregation precedes caspase-mediated apoptosis. Together the results suggest that TUFM plays a key role in the inhibition of apoptosis via regulation of mitochondrial dynamics rather than direct inhibition of apoptosis-related caspases.

We examined the role of TUFM in the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics and apoptotic caspase activation using a combined approach of TOM20-IFA and CASP8 Fluorochrome Inhibitor of Caspases (C8-FLICA). C8-FLICA assay detects active CASP8 in cells. The number of vIRF-1/TUFM-dKD cells with both aggregated mitochondria and CASP8 activation was around 1.9-fold higher compared to vIRF-1-KD cells upon lytic reactivation (Fig. 3C D). Intriguingly the number of C8-FLICA-negative but still abnormal nuclear cells with aggregated mitochondria was equivalent between vIRF-1-KD and vIRF-1/TUFM-dKD cells (Fig. 3D) suggesting a selective role of TUFM in the inhibition of CASP8 induced by altered mitochondria. There was a modest but positive association between aggregated mitochondria and CASP8 activation in individual vIRF-1-KD and vIRF-1/TUFM-dKD cells (Fig. 3E). However the dKD cells showed an increase in the number of cells with highly aggregated mitochondria together with intensive CASP8 activation compared to vIRF-1-KD cells (above the arbitrary threshold in Fig. 3E). Moreover C8-FLICA co-localized in part with aggregated mitochondria in apoptotic cells (Fig. 3F) and the p41/43 fragments of CASP8 were detected at a higher level in the mitochondrial fraction of lytic vIRF-1/TUFM-dKD cells (Fig. 3G). Together our results suggest that TUFM depletion-induced CASP8 activation is largely dependent on altered mitochondria.

To confirm that the proapoptotic effect of TUFM-KD is attributable to an accumulation of altered mitochondria we transduced the control and TUFM-KD cells with DRP1K38A a dominant negative form of DRP1 that inhibits mitochondrial fission [28]. Indeed C8-FLICA assays showed that DRP1K38A expression rendered the both cell lines highly sensitive to lytic reactivation-induced CASP8 activation but to a higher extent in TUFM-KD cells compared with control cells (Figs. 3H and S5). Similar results were obtained with mdivi-1 (Fig. S6) a mitochondrial division inhibitor [29]. Taken together these results suggest that the proapoptotic effect of TUFM-KD in the context of vIRF-1 deficiency is associated with dysregulation of mitochondria quality control.

TUFM can inhibit TRAIL-induced CASP8 activation in the OMM

Mdivi-1 is known to promote death receptor-mediated apoptosis through enhanced CASP8 activity in cancer cells [30 31]. This synergistic effect appears to be associated with dysregulation of mitochondrial dynamics. Thus we investigated whether TUFM depletion potentiates apoptosis induced by combined treatment with TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and mdivi-1. For this experiment we generated HeLa.Kyoto cell lines expressing Dox-inducible shTUFM or shLuc. After Dox incubation for 3 days the cells were treated with TRAIL and/or mdivi-1 for 6 h. Consistent with published findings mdivi-1 promoted TRAIL-induced CASP8 activation in control cells (compare lane 5 with 7 in Fig. 3I). Interestingly we found that mdivi-1 could not further enhance CASP8 activation in the TUFM-KD cells (compare lane 6 with 8 in Fig. 3I) while TRAIL greatly enhanced CASP8 activation in the TUFM-KD cells compared to the control cells treated with DMSO or mdivi-1 (compare lane 6 with lanes 5 and 7 in Fig. 3I). The negation of mdivi-1 activation of CASP8 by TUFM depletion and the efficacy of TUFM depletion alone on CASP8 activation in the context of these cervical cancer cells provides further evidence that TUFM functions to promote mitophagy and prevent the accumulation of damaged mitochondria.

TUFM is localized on the OMM in modified and/or aggregate forms

We next examined the effect of TUFM overexpression on TRAIL-induced CASP8 activation. The TUFM variant (ΔMTS) which lacks the mitochondrial targeting sequences (MTS) was used as a control. Native TUFM but not the ΔMTS form inhibited CASP8 activation induced by TRAIL treatment (Fig. 4A). However the inhibitory effect of TUFM was modest (~30–40% inhibition). As TUFM is mostly imported into the mitochondrial matrix we hypothesized that a minority of TUFM protein on the OMM particularly in mDRM has an ability to inhibit CASP8. To test this we enforced TUFM and TUFM.ΔMTS localization to mDRM by fusing them to the mDRM-targeting N-terminal sequence (V11–150) of vIRF-1 (Fig. 4B). Proteinase K (PK) sensitivity and mitochondrial fractionation assays confirmed that the V11–150 tag could drive TUFM to the cytosolic side and mDRM of the OMM (Fig. S7). Indeed V11–150-TUFM but not V11–150-TUFM.ΔMTS could inhibit TRAIL-induced CASP8 activation by more than 50% compared to the empty vector control (Fig. 4B). Moreover we found that the OMM-targeting sequence (amino acids 1–33) of TOM20 could drive TUFM to mDRM of the OMM (Fig. S7) and the fusion protein TOM201–33-TUFM could significantly inhibit TRAIL-induced CASP8 activation (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that TUFM can inhibit CASP8 activation via the MTS and localization in mDRM of the OMM.

Mitochondrial fractions were treated or left untreated with PK. A lighter blot is shown in the right panel. The preprotein and cleaved (ΔMTS) forms of TUFM are indicated with an arrow and arrowhead respectively. V5-reactive bands with molecular weights higher than the preprotein of TUFM are marked as “modified TUFM”. The red asterisk indicates a new band that appeared after PK treatment (E F). G Predicted topological features of TUFM on the OMM. The presequence-carrying preprotein of TUFM is synthesized in the cytosol imported by the translocase of the outer membrane (TOM40 complex) and the presequence translocase of the inner membrane (TIM23 complex) and cleaved by the mitochondria processing peptidase (MPP) in the matrix. In addition to translocation via the import pathway the preprotein is localized to the OMM facing outward towards the cytosol and presumably also internally (the band marked by red asterisks in E F) potentially by a process involving an as-yet unidentified Mim-like protein. OMM-localized TUFM is subject to ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation. Further details are mentioned in the Discussion section. E3 indicates a Ub E3 ligase. Full size image

Since TUFM interacts with the cytosolic autophagy machinery such as the ATG12-ATG5 conjugate TUFM involved in autophagy activation and/or regulation of CASP8 is likely to locate on the cytosolic side of the OMM. As TUFM exists mostly in the cleaved (mature) form (ΔMTS) an OMM-localized TUFM is expected to comprise a preprotein that is larger than the cleaved form (Fig. 4C). Transfection experiments showed as expected that the major species produced from a wild-type TUFM vector was equivalent to the size of the ΔMTS protein (arrowhead in Fig. 4D) but additional bands including a form migrating above the ΔMTS band (arrow in Fig. 4D) were detected upon prolonged exposure of the immunoblot. Mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP) recognizes basic sequences of mitochondrial preproteins and cleaves a single site often including arginine (R) at the −2 position[32]. Indeed TUFM contains a putative MPP recognition arginine residue at position 41. To assess whether the slower-migrating band is the preprotein of TUFM we generated the TUFM variant R41A by replacing the arginine with alanine (Fig. 4C). However the size of TUFM.R41A was indistinguishable from that of TUFM.ΔMTS (Fig. 4D) indicating that R41 is not involved in MPP recognition and cleavage. It is unclear whether the upper band is the preprotein or a modified form of ΔMTS.

Protease sensitivity assays showed that the slow migrating TUFM band disappeared with PK treatment (Fig. 4E) indicating that it is located on the cytosolic side of the OMM. Intriguingly a new TUFM fragment of about 40 kDa was detected after PK treatment (red asterisk in Fig. 4E) indicating that a Flag tag-containing C-terminal segment of the larger protein might be protected from PK digestion by the OMM with only a small region of the N-terminus exposed to the cytosol.

To investigate the possibility that there exists a form of TUFM orientated inversely with cytoplasmic exposure of containing the functional domains for regulation of autophagy or CASP8 activity we used pharmacological inhibitors of protein degradation to potentially stabilize such a species. Amongst the tested inhibitors only the proteasome inhibitors bortezomib and MG132 could stabilize the high-molecular-weight TUFM species observed previously (Fig. 4D E) and other slower-migrating forms (Fig. S8) which may represent aggregated and/or post-translationally modified forms of TUFM. Bortezomib-stabilized high-molecular-weight species present on isolated mitochondria were susceptible to PK digestion (Fig. 4F) providing evidence that they are located mainly on the cytosolic side of the OMM but rapidly targeted for degradation mainly by the Ub-proteasome system. Taken together we hypothesize that TUFM in part localizes to and may aggregate within (Fig. S8) the OMM with the C-terminus exposed to the cytoplasm and thus is susceptible to cytosolic Ub modification and proteasomal degradation (Fig. 4G).

TUFM is stabilized on mDRM upon mitophagy or autophagy activation

We examined whether endogenous TUFM can be detected in the modified/aggregated forms in virus-infected cells. Indeed higher-molecular-weight TUFM proteins were readily detected in mDRM of lytic cells along with vIRF-1 and stabilized by bortezomib (Fig. 5A). Likewise the ATG12-ATG5 conjugate and NIX but not NLRX1 MAVS and VDAC also were more abundant on mDRM of lytic cells (Fig. 5A). Furthermore ATG12-IFA showed that ATG12 could be localized to mitochondria (Fig. 5B). The modified TUFM and ATG12-ATG5 proteins on the mitochondria isolated from lytic iBCBL-1 cells were susceptible to PK digestion (Fig. 5C). Together these results suggest that mDRM on the OMM may act as an assembly platform for TUFM-mediated autophagy.

Fig. 5: TUFM is stabilized on mDRM by vIRF-1 mitochondrial damage and kaempferide. A Immunoblots of total-cell cytosolic and mitochondrial extracts of iBCBL-1 cells left untreated or treated with Dox for 3 days. Mitochondria were fractionated into detergent soluble (mSol) and insoluble (mDRM) fractions. To facilitate the detection of the modified TUFM proteins the cultures were incubated with 100 nM bortezomib (proteasome inhibitor) for 1 day before cell collection. The ATG12-ATG5 conjugate was detected by anti-ATG12 antibody. Arrows indicate slow-migrating VDAC proteins noted as “Modified VDAC”. A ratio was calculated for each blot by dividing the band intensity of mDRM-localized protein by the intensity of corresponding control band (no Dox and no bortezomib). VDAC and LDH were used as markers of mitochondria and cytosol respectively. B IFA of ATG12 and TOM20 in lytic iBCBL-1 cells (Dox for 3 days).

Cytochrome c (Cyto. c) and flotillin 1 (FLOT1) were used as makers of mSol and mDRM respectively. Red arrowhead indicates TUFM bands of more than 100 kDa. E Immunoblots of extracts of 293T cells transfected with empty or vIRF-1 vector for 1 day and then treated with DMSO or CCCP (mitochondria protonophore) in the presence of 100 nM bortezomib for 6 h before cell collection. The relative levels of high-molecular-weight TUFM protein normalized to β-Actin are noted in red font below the bands. F Immunoblots of extracts of 293T cells treated with 20 µM kaempferide (TUFM-autophagy activator) for 1 day. The relative levels of the high-molecular-weight TUFM species normalized to the mature form are shown below the bands. Full size image

We next examined the role of vIRF-1 in the modifications of TUFM using transfection. Indeed vIRF-1 could promote TUFM modifications and/or aggregates in mDRM (Fig. 5D). Moreover treatment with carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP) a proton ionophore that triggers mitophagy [21] led to increased levels of the observed high-molecular-weight TUFM (>100-kDa) in both the absence and presence of vIRF-1 and to a more pronounced effect in the latter (Fig. 5E). Kaempferide which is an inducer of TUFM-mediated autophagy [33] also enhanced the expression of mDRM-associated high-molecular-weight TUFM by 3.4-fold compared to the level in control cells (Fig. 5F). Together our data correlate TUFM modification with autophagy activation and suggest that vIRF-1-effected TUFM modification may contribute to vIRF-1-promoted mitophagy in infected cells.

TUFM activates autophagy via the canonical pathway

To assess if vIRF-1 promotes TUFM-mediated autophagy flux a tandem TUFM-mCherry-EGFP (TUFM-mCE) fusion protein was generated and transfected into HeLa.Kyoto cells with or without vIRF-1 (Fig. 6A). Once TUFM-mCE is delivered to lysosomes upon autophagy the signal of EGFP but not mCherry is quenched. About 2% of TUFM-mCE-transfected cells showed punctate structures with only red fluoresce (basal autophagy) but vIRF-1 increased up to 15% the population of cells showing this pattern (Fig. 6A). To assess mitophagy flux we generated a mitophagy reporter mito-mCE in which the tandem mCherry-EGFP tag was attached to the TOM201–33 sequence for its mitochondrial targeting (Fig. 6B). The reporter worked for assessment of AO (antimycin A and oligomycin)-induced mitophagy in Parkin-transfected cells (Fig. 6B). The mitophagy assays using mito-mCE showed that TOM201–33-TUFM and to a lesser extent native TUFM promoted mitophagy flux upon AO or TRAIL treatment (Fig. 6C). However TOM201–33-TUFM-medated mitophagy induced by TRAIL was abolished in ATG7 or ATG12 KO cells (Fig. 6D E) indicating that TUFM-mediated mitophagy is activated via the canonical autophagy pathway.

TUFM dimerization via the GxxxG motif within the MTS is required for autophagy

We examined whether TUFM homodimerizes using NanoBiT protein fragment complementation assay[34] (Fig. 7A). The NanoBiT subunits Large BiT (LgB) and Small BiT (SmB) were fused to the C-terminus of TUFM-V5 (Fig. 7B). To verify its true homodimeric interaction on mitochondria TUFM.ΔMTS and the unrelated HaloTag protein were included as negative controls; V11–150-TUFM.ΔMTS and N-terminal point variants (see below) of full-length TUFM fused to LgB were also included (Fig. 7B). Co-transfected with TUFM-V5-LgB TUFM-V5-SmB exhibited stronger luminescence intensity compared to HaloTag-SmB (Fig. 7C). The luminescence intensity was also reduced to background levels by deletion of the MTS. V11–150-TUFM.ΔMTS also could not bind to TUFM (Fig. 7C). These results suggest that the MTS is involved in TUFM dimerization.

Fig. 7: TUFM dimerization via the MTS is essential for autophagic inhibition of CASP8. A Principle of the NanoBiT-based protein fragment complementation assay. When a protein A interacts with its partner B their fused Small BiT (SmB) and Large BiT (LgB) fragments are brought into proximity which allows structural complementation thus yielding a functional enzyme acting on Nano luciferase substrate. B Schematic structure of the NanoBiT-fused proteins used in the following studies. C NanoBiT assays. 293T cells were transiently transfected with the indicated NanoBiT binary plasmids. Each value presents the mean ± standard deviation of triplicate samples from two independent experiments. The expression of the NanoBiT TUFM proteins was examined by V5-immunoblotting (lower panel). D Immunoblots of total-cell and mDRM extracts derived from 293T cells transfected with V5-tagged TUFM TUFMAxxxA and TUFMIxxxI. Arrow arrowhead and red arrowhead indicate the preprotein cleaved form and aggregated (or dimerized) form of TUFM respectively. Lighter V5 blots are shown in the lower panels. E Immunoblot of extracts of HeLa.Kyoto cells transfected with empty vector (–) or TUFM-V5 or TUFMAxxxA-V5 expression plasmids for 24 h and treated with 20 ng/ml of TRAIL for an additional 6 h before cell collection. The relative intensities of the p41/43 fragments of CASP8 normalized to LDH are noted under the blot. F Co-IP assays. 293T cells were transfected with V5-tagged TUFM TUFMAxxxA or V11–150-TUFM for 24 h in the presence of 10 µM kaempferide and 50 nM bortezomib and the cell extracts were subject to V5-IP. Immunoprecipitated complexes and lysates (inputs) were immunoblotted with anti-ATG12 or V5 antibody. G TUFM-mediated mitophagy assays in HeLa.Kyoto cells transfected with TUFM-mCE and TUFMAxxxA-mCE and treated with or without 50 ng/ml TRAIL for 6 h in the presence of emricasan and leupeptin. The data present the mean ± SD of three different images; “n” indicates the number of cells counted. H A proposed model of autophagy-competent TUFM. The TUFM preprotein synthesized in the cytosol is inserted into the OMM by a putative Mim-like protein and rapidly ubiquitinated by a Ub E3 ligase for Ub-proteasome-mediated degradation. However vIRF-1 or an unknown factor that is activated by mitochondrial damage can inhibit the degradation of TUFM by unidentified mechanisms thereby stabilizing TUFM on mDRM and promoting interactions with the autophagy machinery such as the ATG12-ATG5 conjugate. These molecular interactions in turn activate mitophagy to attenuate CASP8 activation. *p < 0.05 **p < 0.01 and ***p < 0.001 (C G). Full size image

The dimerization of membrane proteins is often mediated by their transmembrane helix and highly stabilized by GxxxG motif within the helix[35]. TUFM contains GxxxG motif 15 G LAA G 19 within the MTS. To examine if the introduced GxxxG motif is involved in TUFM dimerization we replaced the glycine residues with alanine (A) leucine (L) or isoleucine (I). The NanoBiT assays showed that the self-interaction of TUFM was diminished by the introduced mutations and most substantially by LxxxL and IxxxI that present bulky hydrophobic side chains (Fig. 7C). It is noteworthy that the TUFMLxxxL and TUFMIxxxI variants showed reduced levels of the predominant ΔMTS species probably due to an interference with import to the mitochondrial matrix. TUFM.R41A also showed reduced dimerization (Fig. 7C). These results suggest that the MTS contains primary-structure determinants of TUFM dimerization.

TUFM dimerization is required for autophagy regulation of CASP8 activation

We examined the involvement of the GxxxG motif in TUFM aggregation. Immunoblotting revealed TUFMAxxxA and to a lesser extent TUFMIxxxI failed to form high-molecular-weight species (Fig. 7D). Moreover TUFMAxxxA failed to inhibit TRAIL-induced CASP8 activation (Fig. 7E) suggesting that TUFM dimerization may be required for the inhibition of CASP8 activation. Furthermore co-IP assays showed that ATG12-ATG5 was co-immunoprecipitated with TUFM and V11–150-TUFM but to a lesser extent with TUFMAxxxA (Fig. 7F). Importantly TUFMAxxxA-mCE failed to mediate mitophagy upon TRAIL treatment (Fig. 7G). Taken together we propose a model for autophagy-competent TUFM (Fig. 7H) in which newly synthesized TUFM preprotein is inserted into the OMM through the action of a putative mammalian mitochondrial import (Mim) complex [36] where it is able to activate autophagy by interacting with the autophagy machinery. vIRF-1 or a cellular mitophagic factor could stabilize autophagy-competent TUFM by protecting it from Ub-proteasome-mediated degradation.",,,,,,,,,,,,

FRAMINGHAM – Tonight Saturday September 11 Framingham Performing & Fire Arts Director Donna Wresinski will direct a one-night only sold out performance of the play Bystander 9/11 at ATAC (formerly known as Amazing Things Arts Center.)

Show starts at 8 p.m. and for those attending in person masks are required and all attendees must show proof of their COVID vaccine.

For our generation the tragic events of September 11 2011 and the coronavirus pandemic will be forever etched in our brains and in our souls.

But if you were not able to get one of the in-person tickets you can watch the performance via Facebook LIVE on the Framingham Public Schools Facebook page.

Wresinski is using theatre to help the community heal from both the anniversary of September 11 and the coronavirus pandemic.

Following the hour-long play written by playwright Meron Langsner there will be a 45-minute panel discussion with the playwright the cast Framingham Superintendent Bob Tremblay Assistant Superintendent Joe Corazinni Framingham Police Framingham Fire and Framingham Interfaith Clergy Association.

Tonight’s cast includes several Framingham Public School educators as well a couple of local politicians.

Framingham High drama teacher Stephanie Henry is the narrator for the play.

There are 8 New Yorkers in the play. Those actors are Eric Dwinnells Alison Courchesne Rep. Jack Patrick Lewis Walsh Middle School Theatre teacher Sheron Doucette Diego Rocha Emily Rathmell District 5 City Councilor Robert Case and Colette Sicotte.

“I am so excited to do this work with these talented performers. They represent so many facets of my life and they all have so much to offer” said Wresinski. “I have always taught my students to use their art to make a difference. I am hoping to do that with this production.”

“The script calls for very simple staging and very limited technical design. The emphasis is on the storytelling and as a director that is the heart of my work” said Wresinski who directs the play with her daughter Teri Shea as assistant director.

Sept 11 & Framingham

Seventeen individuals with ties to Framingham died on September 11 2001. TJX Companies Inc. lost seven employees that day all of them passengers on American Airlines Flight 11 when it was flown into the World Trade Center in New York City. There is a memorial to the victims of September 11 in Cushing Memorial Park. It features a gazebo 17 flowering trees with plaques and a grassy area to represent the lives lost that day.

The 17 people with ties to the City of Framingham were Neilie Heffernan Casey Barbara Keating Linda George Lisa Fenn Gordenstein Meta Fuller Waller Laura Lee Morabito Tara Shea Creamer Charlie Murphy Paige Farley Hackel Judith Larocque Todd Hill Christine Barbuto Susan Mackay Herbert W. Homer John J. Wenkus Robin Kaplan and Darin H. Pontell.

ATAC & Downtown Framingham

The play is produced by Jannelle Codianni executive director at Amazing Things Arts Center.

Wresinski said she wanted the play to be a “city-wide event” and not just a Framingham Public School production.

“I love the venue” said Wresinski who said she always envisioned the play performed in downtown Framingham.

“The intimacy of Amazing Things and the intimacy of this piece are a perfect match” said Wresinski.

Another plus is to introduce many in the community to the small theatre on Hollis Street in Framingham.

“I would love to get more people to Amazing Things. Jannelle the executive director has been a wonderful partner and I am hoping this will be the beginning of several small community shows we can produce there” said Wresinski.

Amy Deane recently opened Snow’s Feed Store Antiques breathing new life into a historic building in Quinque.

“I can remember coming to this store backing up to the end of the building which is where you would dump your corn to have it mixed with molasses and grains” Deane said. “There’s a chart still up that shows you how to make the mixture depending on the livestock. There were no Tractor Supply in that day.”

Deane is a sixth-generation Greene County native whose great-grandparents started Blue Run Grocery in 1931 which is located just down the mountain from Shenandoah National Park on U.S. Route 33. She believes deeply in preserving the history of the county. Her other venture Wooly Lam in Ruckersville is going into its eighth year in November.

“I took a leap and bought this building earlier this year so I could own a piece of our history and make a sister store for the Wooly Lam” she said. “I see a lot of our history our old buildings and post offices being torn down and taken away. I want to preserve the history too. I have some original pieces with the mill room and I’m reaching out to the community for anyone who owns historical items to reach out to me. I am going to display them in the mill room.”

Recently Deane purchased the “Customer Parking” sign from the red antique store building in the old Dulaney Brothers store.

“The day after I purchased it a lady from Culpeper reached out to me after she found out that I had purchased it” Deane said. “She’s the daughter of the man who painted that sign and I was going to give it back to her but when she found out that I’m putting it up in the mill room they decided to give me a picture of him to display with the sign and of the old building they’re going to tear down.”

Even though Deane has had success with the Wooly Lam which is a 9000-square-foot building with 26 vendors she said she was still nervous buying the 4000-square-foot feed store building built in 1900—but she already has 12 vendors signed on.

“I think it’s a very scary time to take this leap of faith with COVID-19 cases going up again” Deane said. “But we live in a very small close-knit community and it’s just been very supportive.”

Snow’s Feed Store Antiques is an umbrella that houses other small businesses within.

“So you’re not just supporting one small business you’re supporting multiple which is the same way as the Wooly Lam” Deane said. “I would not have been able to take this leap if I did not feel the community would support it. The community is very good about buying local and supporting local.”

Deane plans to fix up an old Coke machine to place near the entrance for glass bottles of Coke for guests as they shop. Behind the cash register is an old Coke advertisement found in the back of the building and an old red Coca-Cola cooler below it.

The mill room still houses the grinder and molasses machine among other bins and bags from when it was a feed store. On one wall is the Purina chart that told mixers how much of what to use with the corn to create the proper feed for the type of animals.

“I have the old corn cutter too” Deane said. “You’d lay your stalks of corn there and cut them. It says ‘Harris & Son Charlottesville Virginia.’ They made that piece for them here.”

Deane said there is still a lot of maintenance she needs to do at the new shop—which is just 2 miles from the Wooly Lam—so it will be open every day except for Wednesdays until at least the beginning of 2022. One goal for the sister store is to have somewhere to refer drivers on U.S. Route 29 out onto U.S. Route 33 and vice versa as well as recommending other places to visit and eat while the customer is in town.

“In the antiques business we’re a close knit network” she said. “We work together very well.”

Snow’s Feed Store Antiques is located at the intersection of U.S. 33 and Amicus Road at 12785 Spotswood Trail. It is open Monday Tuesday Thursday and Friday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday.

Before 9/11 private security companies who were hired by airlines screened passengers. Passengers just walked through metal detectors then they were on their way.

Travelers going through security checkpoints did not have to take their shoes off or throw away certain foods and liquids. Also passengers did not need a boarding pass to go through security.

""You could take your loved one to the airport and you could actually walk them all the way to the gate give your hugs and kisses and wave to them as they went down the jetway that was such a cool experience that when I tell my son how it was he can't believe it"" said Tanja Wasielewski who flew into Tampa International Airport from Las Vegas.

It all changed after the attacks.

Two months later in November 2001 President George W. Bush signed the Aviation and Transportation Security Act. It formed the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) where federal employees screened passengers.

They also began screening every checked bag there were more air marshals on flights and locks on cockpit doors were added.

WATERFORD Ohio (WOUB) – Since 2018 the Trimble Tomcats have dominated the Waterford Wildcats and Saturday night’s matchup was no different as the Tomcats defeated the Wildcats 34-7.

There were many uncertainties heading into this game. Originally scheduled for Friday night the schools agreed to push back the date to accommodate for Trimble’s ongoing COVID-19 outbreak that forced them to shut down football activities until September 8. As a result the Tomcats came into Saturday’s game with only two practices under their belt.

The Wildcats came out and punched the Tomcats right in the mouth to open the game as Holden Dailey fielded the opening kickoff at his own 5-yard line before returning it all the way down to the Trimble 31-yard line. Dailey would cap off the drive four plays later with a 12-yard touchdown run.

Dailey would finish the night with 85 yards on the ground on 20 carries with his lone score coming on the opening drive. Along with being Waterford’s leading rusher Dailey was Waterford’s leading receiver hauling in one reception for 24 yards.

Facing a 7-0 deficit the Tomcats didn’t hit the panic button. They managed to tie the game at seven to close out the half before adding 27 second-half points and holding Waterford scoreless in the second half.

A lot of Trimble’s success came when the ball was in Tabor Lackey’s hands. Bryce Downs didn’t have a terrible night accounting for 88 yards on 19 carries however the Waterford defense executed a good game plan to limit big plays from Downs. With all their focus on Downs the Tomcats were able to utilize the legs of Lackey to find holes in the Wildcat defense.

Lackey was the leading rusher for the Tomcats accounting for 239 yards on 25 carries. All four of Lackey’s touchdowns came on the ground. Lackey also proved to be the more efficient passer of the two teams completing eight of his 15 passing attempts for 111 yards.

Austin Wisor was Lackey’s go-to receiver with 81 yards on five receptions. Blake Guffey also wreaked havoc in the middle of the field catching two passes for 29 yards.

With the loss Waterford drops to 2-2 (0-1) on the season. They’ll look to snap their two-game losing streak when they play host to South Gallia next week.

With the win the Trimble Tomcats improve to 3-0 (1-0) find themselves in the driver’s seat to win the TVC-Hocking conference title for the fourth consecutive season. Their next two weeks will be huge tests for the Tomcats as they hit the road to take on John Marshall in West Virginia next week before playing host to Fort Frye in week six.",,,,,,,,,,,,
TFC,Truist,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqAFodHRwczovL2pvdXJuYWxub3cuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvdHJ1aXN0LXRvcC1leGVjdXRpdmUta2luZy1yZXRpcmVzLWFzLWNlby1ncmF0ZWZ1bC13aXRoLXVuZmluaXNoZWQtY29tbXVuaXR5LWJ1c2luZXNzL2FydGljbGVfNDE4ZGQzYWMtMGY0YS0xMWVjLTk3ODEtOTMzOGM1YWJhOTVhLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Truist top executive King retires as CEO grateful with unfinished community business,"When Kelly King began working for BB&T Corp. in 1972 his career aspiration was working as a branch manager near his eastern North Carolina roots.

“That would have been awesome” King said with an upbeat tone to his voice in a recent interview with the Winston-Salem Journal.

Instead King retires Monday after nearly 13 years as chief executive of BB&T and nearly two years in the same role with Truist Financial Corp.

Truist — the offspring of BB&T’s $33.4 billion purchase of SunTrust Banks Inc. — is the nation’s seventh-largest bank with a 17-state reach stretching from New Jersey to Texas with North Carolina at its center and serving as its heartbeat.

King chose Sunday to be his final day as CEO in part because it is his 73rd birthday.

King remains executive chairman until retiring on March 12 as a Truist employee. He is being replaced in both roles by Bill Rogers the former SunTrust chairman and chief executive. King will remain on the board of directors until the end of 2023.

It’s a career — and life — path that King said represents his Christian faith; a hard-driven work ethic; a belief in giving back; and discovering and acting on a purpose forged during a spiritual awakening.

Although King’s office has been in Charlotte since Truist debuted in December 2019 he readily credits the 24 years spent in Winston-Salem for being among the most formative of his life.

That includes serving in deacon leadership at First Baptist Church on Fifth raising a family here and developing the confidence to step up as BB&T’s CEO in January 2009 in the harrowing early months of the Great Recession.

It’s a major reason why King who could spend his retirement days anywhere is coming back to Winston-Salem.

There’s some unfinished business to accomplish here.

Seismic bookends

King said it’s not lost on him that there are seismic bookends to his time as BB&T’s and Truist’s top executive.

King’s firm hand on BB&T through the turbulent waters of the Great Recession enabled it to be just one of three national or super-regional banks to be profitable every quarter from 2008 through 2011 when many peers had one or more eight-to-11-figure quarterly losses.

He’s retiring in the midst of a fourth surge of the COVID-19 pandemic.

“These two mega lifetime events have made it challenging for sure” King said.

“But they also were rewarding to see how well our company has not just survived but thrived in extremely difficult circumstances. We weren’t firing people left and right during that crisis.

“I feel a sense of corporate achievement that we have been resilient and have performed well in tough times as well as good times.”

King said some companies look at their purpose as “growing market share or getting bigger or making more money.”

Although Truist has shareholders to reward from its profits and quarterly dividends King said of those priorities “that’s just not us.”

“We are a different company because we are genuinely focused on culture and how we define culture is that it is about purpose mission and values” King said.

“They really all go together to help build better lives and communities. I am personally very proud of that ... and it aligns with my personal purpose.”

Legacy thoughts

King knows that entering retirement goes hand-in-hand with fielding questions about his legacy at BB&T/Truist and within the bank industry.

He insists that legacies whether professional or personal have never been top-of-mind in making decisions.

That said King acknowledges smoothly completing in 2022 the branch and operational consolidations of BB&T and SunTrust will play a significant role in defining his CEO tenure.

When encouraged on the topic King said he believes his emphasis on leadership has resonated within the bank and in the industry.

Which is why King said one of his greatest professional honors has been BB&T naming its Greensboro leadership institute as the Kelly S. King Center in August 2019.

The 60000-square-foot campus is nestled among 11 acres of woods next to a seven-acre pond and behind Triad Corporate Center a 390000-square-foot building near Piedmont Triad International Airport where Truist has a major presence with at least 1700 employees.

The $35 million campus debuted in June 2018. Its purpose is making the bank’s leadership development programs more readily available to the business world and community at large.

King expressed confidence he is leaving the bank in better financial socioeconomic and community outreach shape but will leave it up to others to determine that validity.

Up to others

There is no shortage of vouchers.

“Kelly King has achieved industry-leading outcomes through his consistent focus on innovation” Bank of America Corp. chief executive Brian Moynihan said.

“His inspirational leadership and commitment to building stronger communities has had a tremendous influence within the industry and on me personally.”

John Allison King’s predecessor as BB&T’s chairman and chief executive said “the best decision I made was recommending Kelly King as my replacement.”

“Kelly has done an outstanding job leading the organization though challenging economic and regulatory environments successfully negotiating the merger of BB&T and SunTrust and managing the integration of these large companies.” Allison said.

“It has produced a financial institution that can prosper in a rapidly changing highly competitive industry.”

Chris Marinac a financial services analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott has followed King and BB&T since the early 1990s.

“Kelly had the vision to convince SunTrust they were better off together with BB&T than running as a separate regional bank” Marinac said. “This is a key part of Kelly’s DNA to be a leader and have vision.”

Marinac said during his time analyzing the industry “there are probably 85% of banks who follow and just 15% who lead.”

“It is Kelly who fostered a leadership mentality across all operating environments and even during a pandemic” Marinac said.

“It has truly been fun to watch. What Kelly brings to the table is leadership and setting the tone and example himself.”

True to himself

“It’s quite difficult to sum up the measure of a man who’s been as enigmatic yet dynamic in the big-bank corporate world as Kelly King” said Tony Plath a retired finance professor at UNC Charlotte.

Plath said even though King casts a calm comforting outward persona as chief executive “he is an intense and driven competitor and much more strong-willed.”

As well as King performed the right-hand man role during Allison’s nearly 20 years as BB&T’s top executive Plath said King as CEO “became something completely different from an extension of John” amid expectations of King being a caretaker for a couple of years before giving way to a next generation of leadership.

“He became a real signature CEO leaving his distinct and unique imprimatur on the face of the corporation its culture and its people. He succeeded spectacularly in taking the bank to new heights in a new different and risky direction” with bank deals that culminated with SunTrust.

“He gently shifted the bank’s corporate culture away from secular objectivism toward a more spiritual servant-leader theme without becoming annoyingly preachy in the process” Plath said.

Plath credited King for shifting BB&T from a late adopter of new technology and banking strategies to “an industry leader in financial technology and automation product and process innovation and real-world implementation.”

Plath said he believes King’s greatest achievement “is that he did all of these things quietly accurately proficiently competently successfully and with little public acclaim shareholder fanfare or analyst accolade.”

Drawing strength

King’s commitment to God and faith first family second and career after that are not simple platitudes.

They are what shaped his life from a poor and sometimes rugged upbringing on a family farm.

When King was named CEO of BB&T there were some murmurings that the bank may take on a more religious even evangelical tone to its culture considering the importance of his Cooperative Baptist faith to his purpose.

Those concerns dissipated over time as King held true to a Christ-like belief that it is more important to teach an individual how to fish approach to self-improvement.

“Faith has been extraordinarily important in how I have performed as CEO not directly in terms of trying to use my position to influence people from my faith. I don’t believe in that” King said.

“Faith is what has given me a sense of direction a sense of purpose staying power in getting through the hard times whether in 2009 or the past 18 months” King said.

“Then I go out and do what I believe I am supposed to be doing and I have a sense of peace and resolve about that.”

Symbiotic ties

King said he recognizes the symbiotic relationship that the bank has had on Winston-Salem and how the reverse also is true for not only the bank but himself and his family.

“Winston-Salem has had a really big impact on me with my personal life and my family’s life in terms of our spiritual development and commitment to our church” King said. “I am grateful that I have had opportunities to have an impact on the local community.

“Winston-Salem has been extremely supportive during an important stretch for the bank dating back to the (1995) merger with Southern National that brought BB&T here in the first place.

“It has been the home base for so much of our growth and success which catapulted us into the position to be able to create Truist.”

Winston-Salem Mayor Allen Joines said King’s influence on the local community goes beyond “being an amazing leader at BB&T and Truist.”

“He also had a huge positive impact on our community. As an example he recruited a BB&T executive to chair our Ten-Year Plan to End Chronic Homelessness that was able to reduce chronic homelessness by 92%.

“Kelly was also very interested in school achievement and devoted BB&T resources to addressing it.

“Most recently he was instrumental in several contributions to programs here in the city including a free college program at Forsyth Technical Community College a paid internship for disadvantaged high school students support for small business development and helping to create a program to assist in recruiting technology talent to Winston Salem.”

Gayle Anderson the retired chief executive and president of the Winston-Salem Chamber of Commerce credited King with “instilling into the corporate culture of BB&T his belief that companies have an obligation to their employees communities and shareholders.”

“He championed the Lighthouse Project to demonstrate the importance of supporting the locations where Truist operates.”

Lighthouse Project

In the fall of 2009 sweat equity took on a new meaning for at least two-thirds of BB&T’s 30000 employees at that time with Winston-Salem being sort of a guinea pig for the giving-back Lighthouse Project initiative.

BB&T allotted $3 million in the first year based on a $100 contribution for each employee as well as paid time-off to serve.

Employees including King and the management team participated in 1005 projects in 2009. They pulled weeds painted chairs built walls assembled toys provided museum tours prepared care packages for overseas troops and stocked food pantries.

Fast forward 12 years and the Lighthouse Project has completed more than 12000 community service projects and employee volunteers have spent more than 700000 hours working to serve more than 18 million people in need.

“The impact of the Lighthouse Project has been huge” King said.

“It represented an extension of my philosophy and our team’s philosophy that we needed to give back — we had to do something — during the dark days of the Great Recession.

“There were so many people so many organizations really struggling and suffering at that time” King said. “There are people really struggling and suffering right now in this pandemic.

The project reflected a subtle change in the culture of the bank under King’s leadership compared with Allison.

Allison believed BB&T’s community role was to be as successful as possible thereby generating the revenue to provide employees with compensation levels from which they could contribute personally to local nonprofit and charitable initiatives.

“We never dictated from the top but challenged our teammates to pick the projects” King said. “No one project emerged as more important than the others.

“People have really rallied around the project in good and bad times because they really wanted to help those in need.

“What we didn’t necessarily count on what I didn’t necessarily count on was how much better we felt I felt from those individual growth opportunities to live out what you believe.”

Truist’s future

When Rogers assumes Truist’s CEO role on Monday it will be the first non-BB&T executive in charge of the bank.

However King doesn’t look at the transition that way but rather that he was the first CEO of Truist and he is handing off to the second CEO.

King said part of his confidence in Rogers becoming CEO “is that we are a lot alike.”

“He believes deeply and passionately about purpose. We’re 100% aligned on purpose. You may have different views about strategies and tactics but that doesn’t matter because purpose is enduring.

“When I walk out and he walks in this office they’ll be no difference outside the former CEO was about four inches taller.”

Marinac said the gentlemen’s agreement between King and Rogers “to run the company with a common purpose as they integrate has been executed as they said it would back in February 2019.”

“I have great confidence that Bill Rogers continues on the same path as Kelly and in fact Bill should become an even better CEO thanks to following Kelly King the past 20 months.”

Allison said that “while Bill Rogers came from SunTrust he appears to share the same core values that made BB&T successful and is clearly qualified to lead Truist forward.”

King said Truist “is not trying to make the world better by ourselves. We can’t.”

“We can inspire as we build better lives and communities and have others comes along aside us and work together and have a bigger impact.”

Coming home

King chuckled when asked what retirement will look like for him.

“As long as I can remember I have always worked and I have worked almost 50 years now” King said.

“If retirement is laying around and soaking up the sun that’s not me.”

King said his faith will serve as his retirement guide.

“I’m not spending a lot of energy right trying to figure what I am going to do starting March 13” King said.

“My faith is strong and I believe (the path) will be very clear and that I will be very active in the community.

“There’s a lot of work out there that needs to be done that I am very very interested in as it relates to innovation and how we can help North Carolina grow to be a more balanced state from the coast to the mountains and to a lesser degree in the Triad” compared with Charlotte and the Triangle.

King said he is humbled to have heard expectations of him having a retirement similar to President Jimmy Carter whose charitable activities over the past 41 years have eclipsed his one term in office.

“Jimmy Carter is one of my heroes because even to this day he has given his life to others” King said. “I respect that. I appreciate that.

“If somebody someday were to say that I had a retirement life like Jimmy Carter I would say ‘thank you so much that’s a blessing.’ “

Justin Hawkins is an exception.

“It’s actually one of my favorite topics” said Hawkins region president for Wells Fargo who oversees consumer and small business banking operations for most of South Carolina except the Hilton Head market. “We’ve all been through the pain of watching branches close but I think we’ve done it the right way.”

A newly issued report from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. puts some fresh numbers on the industry’s steady pullback.

The agency's annual accounting of market-share data showed that 28 branches or about 2 percent went dark across South Carolina between mid-2020 and mid-2021 trimming the net balance to 1171 locations.

The most active consolidator during that period was Truist Financial Corp. which this year is taking its cost-cutting axe to about 400 overlapping BB&T and SunTrust locations that it took on when it combined the two regional players in late 2019. In the Palmetto State 17 of the branches were shuttered according to the FDIC report.

First-Citizens of Raleigh was second to Truist with 10 closings followed by Wells Fargo with eight.

South Carolina isn't an outlier. A record 3324 branches were closed nationwide in 2020 or more than three times the number of openings according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.

The pace of the retrenchment has been accelerating. In South Carolina for example banks turned off the lights at 153 branches between 2011 and 2016. But during the past five years closings jumped 76 percent to 270 the FDIC said.

A steady stream of bank buyouts that keeps realigning the business is one of the key culprits as Truist can attest to. The urge-to-merge has whittled the number of lenders that do business in South Carolina to 76 from 116 over the past decade.

Another factor is that customers are more comfortable using ATMs and personal technology to handle routine tasks such as depositing checks through their smartphones. As a result Hawkins said branches are increasingly becoming ""advice centers"" as opposed to their former primary roles as ""transactional centers.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vcmVkYmlyZHJhbnRzLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA5LzEyL3N0LWxvdWlzLWNhcmRpbmFscy1lZG11bmRvLXNvc2FzLWZ1dHVyZS8zL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What is Edmundo Sosa's future with the St. Louis Cardinals?,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vam91cm5hbG5vdy5jb20vcGhvdG9zLWtlbGx5LWtpbmctdG8tcmV0aXJlL2NvbGxlY3Rpb25fMGE4OTVhZDYtMTI5NS0xMWVjLWI2YjQtNzM1NDIyNjUzMzY5Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PHOTOS: Kelly King to retire,"Register for more free articles.

Dr. Murthy called the plan “ambitious and thoughtful” on the ABC program “This Week” saying “These kinds of requirements actually work to improve our vaccination rates.” He said they were part of “a serious of steps that have to be taken in order to protect our country from Covid-19 and help us get through this pandemic.”

He cited Tyson Foods one of the nation’s top meat processors. In August it said it would require Covid vaccinations for its employees. The surgeon general said the company’s vaccination rate had shot up “from 45 percent to more than 70 percent in a very short period of time. And they’re not even at their deadline yet.”

The mandates — for either vaccination or weekly testing — cover 17 million health care workers in institutions that get Medicare and Medicaid funds as well as roughly 80 million employees in private companies with more than 100 workers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd2h5eS5vcmcvYXJ0aWNsZXMvZXhoaWJpdGlvbi10cmFjZXMtYS0yMDAteWVhci1oaXN0b3J5LW9mLXdhdGVyLXBvbGx1dGlvbi1pbi1waGlsYWRlbHBoaWEv0gFmaHR0cHM6Ly93aHl5Lm9yZy9hcnRpY2xlcy9leGhpYml0aW9uLXRyYWNlcy1hLTIwMC15ZWFyLWhpc3Rvcnktb2Ytd2F0ZXItcG9sbHV0aW9uLWluLXBoaWxhZGVscGhpYS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Exhibition traces a 200-year history of water pollution in Philadelphia,"“Downstream” the Science History Institute’s new exhibition about river water analysis over the last 200 years explains the political and scientific history of watershed protection.

It opens Tuesday Sept. 14 and answers the questions: What did we know and when did we know it?

It starts at the birth of the United States in the late 1700s when the capital of the new nation Philadelphia was a “wet and stinking mess” according to the oversized text that immediately greets visitors upon entry.

The area around what is now Dock Street in Old City was dense with leather tanners and beer brewers whose effluvia choked what was then Dock Creek with pollutants.

Curator Jesse Smith said people could see smell and taste the contaminants in the network of creeks that used to form a web of waterways throughout Philadelphia. Their human senses were their primary analytical tools.

“It was biological” he said. “Waste from industries like tanning like brewing animals that were left to rot in waterways and also vast amounts of human waste.”

Arranged chronologically “Downstream” starts with the mess that was Center City water and follows the progressive development of water science over the next two centuries and how it intersected with the ecology politics and economics of water.

Although people knew how bad the water was in the 1700s nothing was done about it until people started dying en masse. A series of yellow fever epidemics — the most serious of which killed 10% of Philadelphia’s population about 5000 people in the fall of 1793 — snapped the city into action.

Philadelphia needed a new source of clean water and the Schuylkill River was the best candidate: a much cleaner waterway on the opposite side of the city from the heavily industrialized Delaware River.

The Fairmount Water Works was built as the nation’s first large-scale municipal water system pulling drinking water from the Schuylkill and sending it through underground wooden pipes throughout the city.

To this day the Philadelphia Water Department occasionally discovers original wooden pipes still underground. “Downstream” features a small section about two feet long under glass.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmt5My5jb20vdmlkZW8vMjAyMS8wOS8xMi9zZXltb3VyLW1vLWNvbW11bml0eS1nYXRoZXJzLXRoLWFubnVhbC1hcHBsZS1mZXN0aXZhbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Seymour Mo. community gathers for 49th annual apple festival,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9kYWlseWhvbWUvbmFtZS9qb3ljZS1tYWRkb3gtb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MzMzNDM5NTLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Joyce Maddox Obituary (1957 - 2021) - Talladega AL - The Daily Home,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/dailyhome/name/joyce-maddox-obituary?id=33343952 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9kYWlseWhvbWUvbmFtZS9qb3ljZS1tYWRkb3gtb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MzMzNDM5NTLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZveC5jb20vMjAyMS85LzExLzIyNjY4MzYwL3VudmFjY2luYXRlZC1jb3ZpZC1kZWx0YS12YXJpYW50LWhvc3BpdGFsaXphdGlvbnMtZGVhdGhzLWNkY9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,CDC study: Unvaccinated people are 11 times more likely to die of Covid-19,"As the Biden administration steps up its efforts to get shots in arms the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday released a new study that underscores the effectiveness of Covid-19 vaccines against serious illness or death.

The study which examined hospitalizations and deaths from Covid-19 over a period of more than three months found that unvaccinated people are more than 10 times more likely to be hospitalized with Covid-19 than those who have been vaccinated and 11 times more likely to die of the virus according to CDC director Rochelle Walensky.

The findings as well as those from two other studies also released by the CDC on Friday are still an early release meaning there could be changes in the final versions. But the results nonetheless provide some clarity about the state of the pandemic while the delta variant continues to make its mark on communities throughout the country.

The study found that as the delta variant became more widespread in the US during the summer protection against initial infections fell slightly — but the vaccine’s “effectiveness against hospitalization and death showed barely any decline during the entire period” the Washington Post reported.

Indeed another of the studies confirmed that effectiveness remains high across the board: On average the three vaccines available in the US — Moderna Pfizer/BioNTech and Johnson & Johnson — were 86 percent effective at preventing hospitalization from Covid-19 and 82 percent effective at preventing visits to the emergency room or urgent care. The researchers also found that Moderna was the most effective at preventing hospitalizations at 95 percent with the Johnson & Johnson shot providing about 60 percent protection against hospital admissions.

Despite the remarkable effectiveness of the Covid-19 vaccines however the virus continues to run rampant as the country struggles with resistance to the vaccine.

With Japan overtaking the United States in vaccinations the US now has the lowest vaccination rate in the G7 despite its head start. pic.twitter.com/JIfJGVK61K — Michael Li 李之樸 (@mcpli) September 11 2021

Americans still lag behind other wealthy countries in vaccine uptake and only 52.76 percent of eligible Americans are fully vaccinated according to the New York Times. Roughly 700000 vaccine doses are being administered each day in the US about 300000 fewer than Japan’s vaccination program currently reports despite Japan’s smaller population.

Currently the US is averaging nearly 146000 new Covid-19 cases per day. (Compare that with June which saw several consecutive days with fewer than 12000 reported cases.) At the pandemic’s peak last winter the country was reporting more than 250000 cases per day on average.

But a new movement toward stricter vaccine requirements coincides with a 7 percent decrease in daily Covid-19 cases over the past two weeks according to the latest numbers from the New York Times. Testing has risen by 8 percent during the same period with more than 1.6 million tests being administered per day on average.

Deaths however — which tend to lag spikes in new cases — are currently increasing in the US. As of Friday the country was averaging more than 1600 deaths per day from the virus. While this statistic is grim there are signs the delta-fueled summer surge is at least leveling off as more people get vaccinated.

Cases in Mississippi where the virus has strained hospital capacity beyond its limits dropped by 37 percent over the past two weeks. In Tennessee which currently has the most cases per capita of any state the vaccination rate increased by 47 percent from July 12 to August 2 and the rate at which infections are increasing in the state has started to slow.

“Our patience is wearing thin”

As the US continues to struggle with Covid-19 President Joe Biden announced on September 9 that all private businesses with more than 100 employees must require either vaccination or weekly Covid-19 testing.

“Many of us are frustrated with the nearly 80 million Americans who are still not vaccinated even though the vaccine is safe effective and free” Biden said at a press conference decrying what he referred to as the “pandemic politics” of Republican leaders who have downplayed Covid-19 spread disinformation and fought against measures like inoculation and mask-wearing.

“We cannot allow these actions to stand in the way of protecting the large majority of Americans who have done their part and want to get back to life as normal” Biden said.

Corporate America is also warming to vaccine mandates with large companies like United Airlines and Tyson Foods implementing vaccine requirements for workers. United which in August set a deadline of September 27 for all of its US-based employees to get at least one shot says that more than half of its previously unvaccinated employees have since been vaccinated according to NPR.

Pediatric Covid-19 cases are on the rise

Despite the significant protection afforded by vaccines however not everyone is eligible yet to receive one. The Food and Drug Administration has yet to authorize a Covid-19 vaccine for kids younger than 12 and pediatric Covid-19 cases are surging — particularly in states that have rebuffed mask mandates — as children head back to in-person schooling.

New York City public schools the largest school system in the country will test its own Covid-19 policies as the school year begins on Monday. All employees of New York City’s Department of Education are required to be fully vaccinated by September 27.

That’s also the case in Los Angeles which on Thursday became the first major public school district in the US to mandate Covid-19 vaccines for all eligible students after a unanimous vote by the school board. The district had already imposed the requirement for teachers and staff.

In Florida where Gov. Ron DeSantis is currently fighting to prevent school districts from requiring masks pediatric deaths from Covid-19 have more than doubled since July. While the number of deaths is still extremely low relative to other age groups — only 17 children have died from Covid-19 in the state since the beginning of the pandemic — seven of those deaths occurred between March 2020 when the outbreak began in the US and July 2021 a period of 15 months. The other 10 occurred after July 30 this year Politico reported.

Additionally according to Politico the Department of Education is investigating Florida’s attempts to prevent school districts in the state from mandating masks. In a letter sent to Florida Department of Education commissioner Robert Corcoran Suzanne Goldberg the deputy assistant secretary for strategic operations and outreach in the DOE’s Office of Civil Rights warned that the policy could violate the civil rights of children with disabilities by preventing them from “safely returning to in-person education.”

Given the increase in pediatric cases and scrutiny of in-school Covid-19 prevention policies the pressure is on for vaccine manufacturers to determine whether their inoculations are safe for use in children.

According to Reuters BioNTech co-founder Özlem Türeci told German news outlet Der Spiegel that it should be able to share the results of its clinical trials on children ages 5 to 11 within the next few weeks and will seek global approval of the vaccine for use in this age group. This means the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine could potentially be authorized for eligible children as soon as the end of October Reuters reported Friday.

BioNTech which partnered with Pfizer to manufacture its vaccine also plans to seek approval for a vaccine for children ages 6 months to 2 years by the end of the year while Moderna said recently it has filled its roster for clinical trials of its vaccine in children ages 6 to 11 and is working to determine an appropriate dosage for children as young as 6 months.

In the meantime Biden officials have emphasized that widespread vaccine uptake among eligible Americans is the best way to keep pediatric Covid-19 cases low.

“That’s why this collective responsibility we have as a society to make sure we are not only taking care of our own health but reducing the chances we pass a virus on to somebody who’s more vulnerable — that’s why this is so important” Surgeon General Vivek Murthy said Friday. “And that’s what the efforts that the president announced yesterday will help us do: reduce transmission protect lives and protect our children as well.”"

Plans to Stick Around (Published 2021),"Bank of America made sweeping changes to the company’s leadership Friday that elevated several executives including three women to senior jobs and all but guaranteed that Brian Moynihan the chief executive would remain at the helm of the nation’s second-largest bank for years to come.

The company promoted Alastair Borthwick its current head of commercial banking in New York to chief financial officer. It also gave more responsibilities to Dean Athanasia who runs the consumer-banking division from Boston. Lauren Mogensen was elevated to general counsel.

Mr. Moynihan is 61 and the race to succeed him is likely to be a long one. Senior executives being groomed for top jobs typically need several years of experience helping to oversee all aspects of a company before they are deemed eligible to take the helm.

Mr. Moynihan signaled his intention to stick around: In a letter to staff he said the new cohort of leaders will help him run the bank in accordance with a growth strategy he put in place in 2010 — when he took the chief executive job — “through its second decade with me and with all of you.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNsZXZlbGFuZC5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxLzA5L3RpcmVkLW9mLXlvdXItYmlnLWJhbmstY29uc2lkZXItdGhlc2UtNC1hbHRlcm5hdGl2ZXMuaHRtbNIBb2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNsZXZlbGFuZC5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxLzA5L3RpcmVkLW9mLXlvdXItYmlnLWJhbmstY29uc2lkZXItdGhlc2UtNC1hbHRlcm5hdGl2ZXMuaHRtbD9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tired of your big bank? Consider these 4 alternatives,"Checking account fees minimal savings rates impersonal customer support. The reasons you might choose to leave a big national bank vary but where you go next might be a harder decision.

Many of the biggest U.S. banks share many of the same benefits including large networks of bank-owned branches and ATMs and robust mobile apps. But they also share many of the same drawbacks such as high overdraft fees and low savings rates. If you want different benefits to better suit your needs consider one of these four alternatives to big banks.

Credit unions

Credit unions are not-for-profit community-focused institutions that generally emphasize customer support. They provide similar accounts services and deposit protections as big banks but their accounts typically have better rates. Compared with banks on average credit unions pay higher interest rates for certain savings accounts and charge lower rates for auto and home loans according to June 2021 data from the National Credit Union Administration.

“Credit unions are built around service not profit” says Chris Lorence executive director at CU Awareness a division of the Credit Union National Association. “Instead of returning funds as dividends to shareholders credit unions return profits beyond operating expenses to members in the form of better rates improved services or access to services.”

Each credit union limits who can join as a member based on certain factors. These factors can include where one lives or works having a relative that’s a member or even being affiliated with a certain group via a small one-time donation. Those membership requirements mean some credit unions aren’t available to everyone. Another potential downside to credit unions is that they tend to lag in adopting new technologies such as mobile banking capabilities that big banks have the means to invest in quicker.

Community banks

Community banks are smaller financial institutions as measured by asset size that focus on specific geographic areas. They provide a vital neighborhood presence for relationship-based banking especially for mortgages and small-business loans. One in three mortgages in rural areas originated from a community bank or credit union with less than $10 billion in assets according to a 2018 report by the Brookings Institute. And in parts of the country a community bank is the only physical bank for miles around and can consider more personalized factors for loans and other accounts than big banks can.

Community banks — defined by the Independent Community Bankers of America as banks with $50 billion or less in assets — issued 4.7 million loans as part of the Paycheck Protection Program for small businesses affected by the pandemic. The loans totaled $429 billion and saved an estimated 49 million jobs according to an ICBA analysis of data from the Small Business Administration. In addition community banks processed PPP loans five to 10 days faster than other PPP lenders.

Earlier in the pandemic “there were so many stories of small businesses that couldn’t get an account at a large bank” says Chris Cole executive vice president of the ICBA. Community banks meanwhile played “an outsized role in PPP to make sure businesses kept going.”

Like credit unions community banks also have difficulty keeping up with newer technology used by bigger institutions and online-focused providers.

Online banks

Online banks are generally national institutions that customers access through websites and typically but not always on mobile apps. Because they’re branchless online banks can pass on savings from not paying for brick-and-mortar locations to customers in the form of minimal fees and some of the highest available savings rates. Some online banks are stand-alone entities and others are online divisions of traditional banks but either way customers’ money is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.

About 40% of Americans who opened online-only accounts during the first year of the pandemic did so because of their high rates according to a 2021 NerdWallet study. Interest rates on online savings accounts can be around 0.4% to 0.5% annual percentage yield which is over 20 times the average rate of 0.02% for the basic savings option at each of the four biggest banks — Chase Bank of America Wells Fargo and Citibank. Online checking accounts tend to have no or low overdraft fees compared with those four banks which charge an average fee of $35 per transaction that puts an account negative.

Going with an online bank means giving up certain services which can include customer support at a branch cash deposits wire transfers and cashier’s checks. In addition not all online banks offer the same variety of accounts so be sure you choose one that has the kinds of accounts you need whether it’s checking savings or both.

Neobanks

Neobanks are financial technology companies that offer mobile-first banking services especially low-cost checking accounts with more perks than traditional institutions offer. Neobanks such as Chime and Current either partner with a bank to provide their accounts or in rare instances become a bank. In either case neobanks have FDIC-insured accounts that act like regular online bank accounts.

These institutions use technology to provide features that most of the biggest banks and some online banks don’t offer such as two-day-early access to direct deposits cash deposits at retailers and more.

“Neobanks are … building lots of money management tools and financial health ideas right into their core banking services from the start” Brenton Peck director at the Financial Health Network said in an email. Some neobanks “carved out a niche by meeting consumers where they were struggling” financially such as SoFi which started out as a nonbank student loan refinance company.

Like online banks neobanks don’t have every service that brick-and-mortar banks do such as in-person support. And only a few neobanks offer high savings rates. There have also been reports of neobanks especially Chime having slow customer support response times and dealing with suspected account fraud by closing accounts abruptly instead of giving sufficient time for customers to respond to claims.

If you’re ready to leave your big bank behind consider your banking needs — from early access to paychecks to high savings rates — to see if one of these four alternatives is a better fit for you.

It marks the sixth official U.S. deployment of troops in Haiti since Dec. 17 1914 when U.S. Marines first landed to unilaterally take despite Haitian government indignation $500000 in gold from the vaults of the National Bank of the Republic of Haiti (BNRH) the nation’s central bank at the time. (One must specify “official” because U.S. troops – often Haitian-Americans–have been covertly deployed in Haiti on several occasions over at least the past three decades.) Subsequent U.S. military interventions would occur on Jul. 28 1915 Sep. 19 1994 Feb. 29 2004 and Jan. 14 2010. These U.S. invasions always justified by a political crisis or natural disaster are just the muscled manifestation of an “invisible hand:” that of finance capital. The penetration of U.S. finance capital into Haiti and the Caribbean displacing European finance capital is laid out in great detail by Peter James Hudson an Associate Professor of African American Studies and History at UCLA in his 2017 book “Bankers and Empire: How Wall Street Colonized the Caribbean” (University of Chicago Press). Over the next three weeks we will publish extended extracts (without the footnotes) from “Bankers and Empire” to edify our readers as to how Haiti became so beholden to and dominated by Washington and Wall Street. – Kim Ives

Introduction: Dark Finance

When James Stillman president of the National City Bank of New York began searching for a space to replace the bank’s cramped and old-fashioned headquarters at 52 Wall Street he sought a building that could evoke the City Bank’s transformation from an early 19th-century merchant bank into one of the most powerful financial institutions in the United States. Stillman wanted a building that signified the City Bank’s new identity while recalling the old a building that could project strength stability and permanence while embodying his almost metaphysical ambitions for the bank’s expansion and growth. Instead of constructing a new edifice from the ground up Stillman decided to purchase and renovate the old U.S. Customs House at 55 Wall Street.

There were some reservations concerning the new building. Frank A. Vanderlip who replaced Stillman as City Bank president three weeks after the opening … had wanted a large modern structure. He anticipated that the fast-growing bank would soon face a crisis of office space and had gone as far as having plans drafted for a multistory tower.

But hidden behind 55 Wall Street’s façade of neoclassicism was another imperial enterprise: an enterprise of banking finance and empire whose ambitions and expansions were braided through the U.S. colonial and neocolonial projects of the early 20th century. While the City Bank was undergoing a transition from 19th-century merchant bank to 20th-century commercial and industrial financier it was also remaking itself as an international financial institution. Where it was once jockeying for business and influence among the brokers merchants and commission agents of old New York the City Bank was now muscling its way to a seat at the table of international finance alongside the imperial banking houses of London Paris and Berlin. And where it once served the financial needs of a fast-growing domestic economy it was increasingly involved with the banking trade finance and debt issuance of the Caribbean Latin America and Asia.

By the time 55 Wall Street’s renovations were complete Stillman and Vanderlip were recasting their institution as an imperial bank. The City Bank’s history began to be written overseas and it increasingly grappled with the conundrums of law and regulation governing international commerce banking and finance as well with the questions of racism and militarism underwriting U.S. imperialism and finance capitalism.

The early history of U.S. imperial banking and the internationalization of Wall Street began alongside the project of U.S. colonial expansion at the turn of the 19th century and ended amid the financial and economic crises of the 1930s. It was fueled by the capital accumulations reaped from the industrial development corporate consolidation and economic expansion that followed the grim history of territorial dispossession that marked the settling of the U.S. West. New York City was its engine. New York’s bankers reaped the rewards of this growth as both the financiers of industrialization and as the representatives of a banker’s bank serving regional financial institutions and the federal government. Buoyed by this newfound wealth New York City’s financial institutions began to look overseas searching for outlets for their swelling accumulations of unproductive capital. They also sought to consolidate Wall Street’s international position in finance trade and commerce. They viewed the organization of an imperial banking system as a critical component in the rise of New York and the westward traverse of the “star of financial supremacy” as imperial theorist and financial reformer Charles A. Conant referred to it from Europe to the United States.

The U.S. government encouraged and supported the internationalization of U.S. banking. The War and State departments required fiscal agencies to support the infrastructure of U.S. colonialism and financial institutions were an important conduit of colonial policy and financial and commercial diplomacy. Bankers however needed little prodding to move overseas and the relations between Wall Street and Washington were contested and contentious.

The City Bank was at the center of the history of banking internationalization and imperialism. A federally chartered commercial bank it emerged as the largest and the most important imperial financier in the United States. Under Stillman and Vanderlip the City Bank adopted an aggressive entrepreneurial and activist strategy for expansion and growth.

The City Bank also made the Caribbean the centerpiece of the largest foreign branch bank system of any U.S. financial institution as it pushed for a share in a market long dominated by Europe and Canada. As part of its efforts of internationalization and in the attempts to create an institution for imperial accumulation the City Bank hammered away at the banking regulations shackling its activities and pushed for regulatory reform. And in its encounters with the peoples nations and colonies of the Caribbean and Latin America it participated in the creation replication and reordering of Caribbean economies on racial lines while helping to reproduce the racist imaginaries and cultures in which finance capital was embedded and through which bankers functioned.

The disordered global financial and economic conditions unleashed by the First World War accelerated the internationalization of Wall Street and intensified the relationship between banking bankers and imperialism. More than any other institution the City Bank under Vanderlip took advantage of the opportunities provided by the war and ran with the new banking legislation of the Federal Reserve Act (1913) the federal legislation that modernized the U.S. financial system and created the legal platform for foreign branch and commercial expansion.

The era of internationalization ended in the 1930s. Black Friday and the stock market crash of 1929 led to a crisis of finance capitalism. The crisis sparked a wave of both antibanking and anti-imperialist sentiment in the United States and the Caribbean. It drew attention to the usurious interest rates and suffocating fiscal conditions imposed by bankers on sovereign nations the strong personal and financial ties between Wall Street and despotic and dictatorial regimes in the Caribbean the ongoing support for U.S. military occupation by finance capital and the virtual control of Caribbean industry and agriculture by banking houses.

The Federal Reserve Act also contained a number of provisions crucial to the expansion of U.S. banking and markets abroad. It created an international system of discount that facilitated the financing of international trade by national banking associations and provided for the establishment of foreign branch banks.

As bankers like James Stillman and Frank A. Vanderlip and lawyers like William Nelson Cromwell and John Sterling slouched in their mahogany-paneled offices and ersatz renaissance parlors–sipping scotch amid overstuffed furniture marble statues and velvet curtains suffused by the smoke of Cuban cigars–and outlined the notional visions of imperial finance on the ground in the Caribbean and Latin America another set of white men were turning the financial abstractions into monetary reality and performing the dirty labors of international banking and empire. These men individuals like the City Bank’s Roger L. Farnham John H. Allen and Joseph H. Durrell have dwelt in the shadows of the larger-than-life robber barons and “wizards” of modern finance who have dominated the lore and historiography of U.S. banking. These unheralded and lesser-known figures were curious individuals. With their knowledge of foreign languages and extensive travel experience they were cosmopolitan in a way most Americans of the time were not–even as they were still shaped by many of the racial and cultural prejudices of their compatriots. Always white always male half frontiersman half accountant more hardened than the gentlemanly capitalists of the City of London less knowing than the economic hit-men of popular literature they were rogue bankers who entered the profession with little formal experience and often with no formal training. Some began as journalists and reporters. Others started as the managers of country banks on the U.S. frontiers. Most eventually drifted to New York City and on to the Caribbean and Latin America and back again finding employment in the U.S. imperial banks operating throughout the region.

Allen aided the bank’s expansion into Cuba and Argentina and was the manager of the City Bank–controlled Banque Nationale de la République d’Haiti in the 1910s. He is perhaps best known for his 1930 article recounting William Jennings Bryan’s decision making in the lead-up to the landing of U.S. Marines in Haiti in 1915. In the article Allen recounts a 1912 briefing Bryan on Haiti’s history and politics. After listening carefully to Allen’s comments Bryan responded

Dear me think of it! Niggers speaking French.

Years earlier in the City Bank’s foreign trade journal The Americas Allen evoked a picture of Haiti that would have been recognizable to white U.S. audiences but for its tropical difference. Allen asserted that “cock-fighting and card playing are the [Haitian] national pastimes and these together with a supply of Haitian rum are all that is necessary for a Haitian citizen’s perfect day.” He claimed that during his visits to Haiti he found that “humorous incidents were of almost daily occurrences.” For Allen such incidents “showed the naivete and also the restricted mentality of the [Haitian] people which latter was plainly noticeable even among the more highly educated.”

MyPoints is currently offering 40000 points when becoming an Uber Eats delivery person and delivering your first order. Those points can be cashed out for at least $250.

The Deal

Earn 40000 points from MyPoints when becoming an Uber Eats delivery person & making your first delivery.

Direct link to offer.

Key Terms

Pass the background check and make your first delivery to earn!

You must complete your first delivery within 30 days of passing your background check.

Please allow 32 days after completing your first delivery for reward to appear in your account.

Bike scooter and car signups are eligible to earn Points if available in your city.

Points for this offer can only be earned once.

Quick Thoughts

This is a great offer seeing as you can earn the points after making only one delivery. 40000 points from MyPoints can be cashed out for $250 via PayPal or slightly more value when redeeming for third party gift card brands (the full list of cashout options can be viewed here once you have a MyPoints account).

That $250 is on top of the (miniscule) amount you’d earn from Uber Eats directly and the tip on the order. If your first order is a large one of you have a particularly generous person you’re delivering to you could end up earning ~$300 just for making one delivery with no obligation to continue as an Uber Eats driver in the future.

If you’ve never used MyPoints before you can earn 1750 points (~$10) when signing up. You have to spend $20+ through the MyPoints portal within 30 days of joining to earn that welcome bonus so you might have to take advantage of a different offer to earn that initial bonus seeing as you wouldn’t be spending $20 with this Uber Eats delivery person offer.

This Uber Eats delivery person offer is available on a couple of other shopping portals but it’s not as generous. Swagbucks is offering $200 and Upromise is offering $150. MyPoints Swagbucks and Upromise are all owned by Prodege so there shouldn’t be any difference in reliability of tracking. Choosing MyPoints for the largest payout therefore makes the most sense seeing as it’s $50 more than Swagbucks.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvYW5uaWVicm93bi8yMDIxLzA5LzEyL2hvdy1haS1pcy1tYWtpbmctdGhlLWdpZy1lY29ub215LW1vcmUtZmFpci1hbmQtcmVsaWFibGUtZm9yLXdvcmtlcnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How AI Is Making The Gig Economy More Fair And Reliable For Workers,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/anniebrown/2021/09/12/how-ai-is-making-the-gig-economy-more-fair-and-reliable-for-workers/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvYW5uaWVicm93bi8yMDIxLzA5LzEyL2hvdy1haS1pcy1tYWtpbmctdGhlLWdpZy1lY29ub215LW1vcmUtZmFpci1hbmQtcmVsaWFibGUtZm9yLXdvcmtlcnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlLTk5ODIyMTkvVWJlci1kcml2ZXJzLVN5ZG5leS1saWZ0LWxpZC1pbGxlZ2FsLUNvdmlkLWxvY2tkb3duLXBhcnRpZXMtc3RlYW15LVRpbmRlci1kYXRlcy5odG1s0gGJAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay9uZXdzL2FydGljbGUtOTk4MjIxOS9hbXAvVWJlci1kcml2ZXJzLVN5ZG5leS1saWZ0LWxpZC1pbGxlZ2FsLUNvdmlkLWxvY2tkb3duLXBhcnRpZXMtc3RlYW15LVRpbmRlci1kYXRlcy5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Uber drivers in Sydney lift the lid on illegal Covid lockdown parties and steamy Tinder dates,"Uber drivers have spilt the beans on Sydney's growing number of lockdown rulebreakers who are getting rideshare services all over the city to attend secret parties and hook-up with Tinder dates.

Sydneysiders are now entering their 14th gruelling week under harsh stay-at-home orders as coronavirus case numbers continue to soar with around 1400 infections a day.

But in the past two weeks rideshare workers say an increasing number of fed-up residents are starting to flaunt the health orders and it's mainly 'white and privileged' people living in suburbs outside the LGAs of concern.

Uber drivers in Sydney say there's a growing number people flouting lockdown rules

'There are some booty calls that you pick up in the morning and the odd failed Tinder date. Then they try to be shy about what they're doing but it's hard to be shy about what you're doing when you're holding a six-pack or a case' driver Graham McLaughlin from Glebe told the Sydney Morning Herald.

He said Friday nights in particular are much more busy with young men going off to mate's places to 'watch the footy' after getting tired of Netflix.

Women are also flagrantly breaching the lockdown rules with at-home hair cosmetic services becoming more popular.

An Uber driver from the Shire in Sydney's south who wished to remain anonymous said she dropped a woman off who said she was going to 'get her nails done'.

One of the giveaways a passenger is on an illegal Tinder date is when they're unsure of the address drivers explained.

Amanda Honey an Uber driver for six years in Sydney's inner west said another tell-tale sign is when a passenger immediately tries to 'justify why they're going somewhere' after stepping in to the car.

The most common excuse is that they are going to meet their other a friend in their designated 'singles bubble' which is allowed under the restrictions.

An increasing number of Sydneysiders are getting rideshare services all over the city to attend secret parties and hook-up with Tinder dates (stock image)

'They'll be all fresh and clean and showered and after-shaved and they're unnecessarily offering what they're doing or where they're going because they're concerned' she said.

But some passengers have not concerns at all about what they're doing.

'I drove a plumber who lived around Bankstown last Friday and he was saying to me: what lockdown? He said 'I've got a business to run and I'm willing to risk the fine I'm just ignoring it completely'.'

Another alarming trend is that more customers are refusing to wear masks a legal condition of entry when stepping inside a rideshare vehicle.

Wayne Newton who lives in the Canterbury-Bankstown LGA of concern which is subject to even harsher rules than the rest of Sydney said of his 10 fares last Thursday eight were not wearing face masks.

Another alarming trend is that more Uber customers are refusing to wear face masks claiming they are exempt

Mr Newton said they claim they have an exemption from the state-wide health mandate and there isn't much he can do to stop them.

Over the past two weeks the number of people seeking directions through Apple Maps appears to corroborate the Uber driver's claims.

The eight-day average was at 55.68 percent of normal levels but increased to 60.22 per cent in the week to September 8 indicating there are more people travelling around locked-down Sydney.

The NSW government is set to greatly ease restrictions for the fully vaccinated in mid-October when Covid vaccination rates eclipse 70 per cent for those aged over 16.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL21lZGl1bS5kYXRhZHJpdmVuaW52ZXN0b3IuY29tL29sYS1seWZ0LXJhcGlkby1nb2play1ncmFiLWFuZC11YmVyLWJpa2VzLXJpZGUtZGVtYW5kLWZvcmVjYXN0aW5nLWRhdGEtc2NpZW5jZS1pbi1jZWFkMDJlNDQyMDHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ola Lyft Rapido Gojek Grab and Uber Bikes Ride Demand Forecasting | Data Science in…,"Ola Lyft Rapido Gojek Grab and Uber Bikes Ride Demand Forecasting | Data Science in Ride-Hailing (Transportation) Domain Shaurya Uppal · Follow Published in DataDrivenInvestor · 6 min read · Sep 11 2021 -- Listen Share

“Life is not about waiting for the storms to pass: it’s about learning how to ride in the rain!”

Bike Ride Demand Forecasting (Source: Dribble)

Project Description

The taxi service (ride-hailing) industry is growing for the last couple of years and it is expected to grow in near future. Taxi drivers need to choose where to hang tight for passengers as they can get somebody quickly. Passengers also prefer a quick taxi service whenever needed. We all have faced problems with taxi booking requests which sometimes cannot be fulfilled or the wait time for ride arrival is very long due to the unavailability of a nearby taxi. One should feel fortunate if you get a taxi booked in one go.

Taxi demand prediction has become extremely important for taxi-hailing (and e-haling) companies to understand their demand and optimize their fleet management.

To handle such issues we would be building a model based on users’ ride request dataset which would contain attributes: ride booking time pickup point and drop point latitude-longitude. This model would forecast the demand for a particular time in different areas of the city which would help the company optimize taxi concentration to fulfill users’ demand.

Business Problem

Ride Haling Companies are suffering losses and losing out from their competition due to their inability to fulfill the ride requests of many users. To tackle this problem you are asked to predict demand for rides in a certain region and a given future time window. This would help them allocate drivers more intelligently to meet the ride requests from users.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ncWluZGlhLmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L2NvbnRlbnQvcmFudmVlci1zaW5naC1qYW5odmkta2Fwb29yLWluZGlhbi1jZWxlYnMtZHJpdmUtdGhlLXViZXItbHV4dXJpb3VzLW1lcmNlZGVzLW1heWJhY2gtY29zdHMtb3Zlci1ycy0yLWNyb3Jl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ranveer Singh to Janhvi Kapoor Indian celebs who drive the uber-luxurious Mercedes Maybach that costs over Rs 2 ...,"As we said the relatively new Mercedes Maybach GLS S600 has been a hot favourite among Bollywood celebrities and Ayushmann Khurrana is another celeb who got the towering SUV registered in his name.

Beauty is coming soon,"It's Ariana Grande's turn to get into the beauty business. Well the makeup business—she already has a best-selling fragrance brand. R.E.M. Beauty Grande's makeup line will be debuting this fall. The superstar gave an interview to Allure where she spilled all the details on what we can expect from R.E.M. and why she thinks the celebrity beauty space has room for one more.

Grande is launching makeup in collaboration with Forma Brands a beauty incubator from Morphe. According to Allure R.E.M. will launch with a series of drops the first being all about eyes. “They’re our main storytellers and sources of communication” Grande tells the magazine. “I feel like you can emote more with your eyes than you can articulate sometimes.”

Fans can expect liquid eyeliner markers to help create Grande's signature cat-eye matte liquid eyeshadows (another Grande signature) and a mascara. There will also be lipsticks and plumping gloss-stains that are meant to seriously tingle. False eyelashes are coming soon too.

Like many of Grande's music videos R.E.M. Beauty's teaser video features a retro-futuristic aesthetic. The singer is shown upside-down with her head inside an old black-and-white TV box set. “I’ve always sort of gravitated towards the ‘50s and ‘60s and ‘70s for glamour references” Grande tells Allure. “I’ve always pictured myself in a different time period. I’ve always wanted to wear that makeup wear that hair wear those outfits be those performers.”

Why the name R.E.M. Beauty? For starters it's a popular song from her album Sweetener. It also sounds like Grande's nickname Ari. What's more she recently launched an eau de parfum called R.E.M. at Ulta Beauty. And finally it's the abbreviation for rapid eye movement the deepest state of sleep. The brand's tagline? Where beauty dreams become reality. Makes sense.

No word yet on the exact launch date prices or product names but we'll update this post when we know more.

If you want to go as blonde as someone like Karlie Kloss here don't jump right into a complete bleached look. First consult with a hair stylist to find out if this type of look is even right for your specific hair.

Even if you plan on taking the dye into your own hands for an at-home treatment it is important to do the research first to determine which shades and undertones will bring your color down to your intended shade of blonde. The last thing you'd want is a botched dye job!

And once you do go blonde don't forget to maintain your newly dyed hair with hydrating shampoos and color-protecting products.

Not sure if the Cinderella look is right for you? There is another way to lighten up your look this season: color-blocking. We've been seeing this trend gain momentum for some time now.

Sonya Dove of the Ulta Beauty Pro Team told SheFinds that “Color blocking at the front of the hair is really popular because it lightens and brightens around the face. It’s a great technique that’s low maintenance versatile and can be adapted to fit any color to suit the individual.”

Some of us are guilty of grabbing the first one to catch our eyes while perusing the aisles of Target but at some point — probably mid-spin class when we notice those alarming racoon-like circles in the mirror—we must ask ourselves are we really living our best eyeliner lives? Ahead the 30 best eyeliners of all time.

Despite their many similarities no two liners are the same. Some are designed for sharp lines while others were made for smudging. A few classics come only in black whereas others cover nearly every color of the rainbow. There's waterproof and non-waterproof powders and pencils gels and liquids... the list could continue.

Half the people surveyed in a 2020 Good Housekeeping report said they use a traditional eyeliner pencil rather than newfangled gel pots and powders. All agreed however that longevity was key.

Whether you like a dramatic look or a razor-sharp wing you want it to keep its place. These fan-favorite liners are budge-proof (some also smudge-proof) ultra-precise and pigmented.

“I needed to make a national recognition for these crew members” said Paul Veneto 62 who arrived in lower Manhattan after pushing a replica beverage cart all the way from Boston.

“They were the first responders of 9/11” Veneto a former United Airlines crew member said. “These flight attendants were the first ones to go hand-to-hand combat with the terrorists that morning.”

Veneto was close to many of the crew members of United Flight 175 the first plane to crash into the World Trade Center on 9/11 after taking off from Boston’s Logan Airport.

“The flight crew members were heroes” Veneto said. “And over 20 years we never heard anything about these crew members never recognized them as heroes.”

Veneto has set up a charity organization called Paulie’s Push to honor the 33 pilots and flight attendants who were slain in the attacks. He hit the road on Aug. 21 to make the 240-mile trek to Ground Zero — trudging through the remnants of two hurricanes Henri and Ida to get to New York in time for the 20th anniversary of 9/11.

“I want all their relatives their cousins and brothers their aunts and uncles — all of them to hear it from all of us in this country that we recognize them for what they did that day” he said.

Ralph Bagarella was the president of the Boston branch of the Association of Flight Attendants on 9/11. Saturday was his first return to New York since the aftermath of the attacks.

“It’s hard for me to express” he said holding back tears. “We knew each other. They were my friends.

“We are going to continue to do this — to recognize them forever.“",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzA5LzExL2J1c2gtaGFycmlzLXBvaW50LXRvLXVuaXR5LWFmdGVyLTktMTEtaW4tbWVtb3JpYWwtc3BlZWNoZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bush Harris point to unity after 9/11 in memorial speeches,"The chimes of the Bells of Remembrance at the memorial service for the victims and heroes of Flight 93 in Shanksville PA was followed Saturday by a thunderous speech on a divided nation from former President George W. Bush.

“In the weeks and months following the 9/11 attacks I was proud to lead an amazing resilient united people. When it comes to the unity of America those days seem distant from our own” Bush said.

“[Malignant forces seem] at work in our common life that turns every disagreement into an argument and every argument into a clash of cultures” the 43rd president said. “So much of our politics has become a naked appeal to anger fear and resentment. That leaves us worried about our nation and our future together.”

In an apparent reference to the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection as well as the 9/11 hijackers the former president offered a warning:

“We have seen growing evidence that the dangers to our country can come not only across borders but from violence that gathers within” Bush said. “There is little cultural overlap between violent extremists abroad and violent extremists at home. But in their disdain for pluralism in their disregard for human life in their determination to defile national symbols — they are children of the same foul spirit and it is our continuing duty to confront them.

“I come without explanations or solutions” he continued. “I can only tell you what I’ve seen. On America’s day of trial and grief I saw millions of people instinctively grab for a neighbor’s hand and rally to the cause of one another. That is the America I know.

“Twenty years ago terrorists chose a random group of Americans on a routine flight to be collateral damage in a spectacular act of terror. The 33 passengers and seven crew of Flight 93 could have been any group of citizens selected by fate. In a sense they stood in for us all. The terrorists soon discovered that a random group of Americans is an exceptional group of people.

“This is not mere nostalgia” Bush insisted. “It is the truest version of ourselves. It is what we have been and what we can be again.

“Whenever we need hope and inspiration we can look to the skies and remember.”

United Airlines Flight 93 the fourth hijacked plane was headed to Washington to attack the Capitol or White House but crashed into the field east of Pittsburgh after the 40 passengers and crew took action to stop the terrorists. The plane was just 18 minutes from Washington.

Memorial officials on Saturday read the names of the passengers and crew and rang bells for each person at the Flight 93 National Memorial. “It is truly fitting that we pause to remember those individuals who lost their lives and save so many when flight 93 crashed into the hallowed ground” said Stephen Clark superintendent of the National Parks of Western Pennsylvania The Associated Press reported.

Vice President Kamala Harris also spoke. “We stand today with all of those who lost someone in 2001 and in the aftermath of the attacks” she said. “So many in our nation — too many in our nation — have deeply felt the passage of time these last 20 years.

“Every birthday your loved one missed. Every holiday Every time her favorite team won or his favorite song came on the radio. Every time you’ve tucked in your children or dropped them off at college. You have felt every day every week and every year that has passed these 20 years.”

Harris also echoed Bush’s theme of unity.

“In a time of outright terror we turned toward each other. In the face of a stranger we saw a neighbor and a friend” Harris said noting that even though people had differences of opinion in 2001 the country still came together when it was attacked. “That time reminded us [of] the significance and the strength of our unity as Americans.”",,,,,,,,,

It was three years ago that planning permission was granted for the fully automated 1.2 million sq ft UPS UK air hub at the Castle Donington airport.

The site is now operational following a mammoth construction effort and it is sorting millions of packages for delivery around the UK and abroad.

It is now the second biggest European air operation for UPS after Cologne.

During daylight hours the £138 million warehouse – a maze of conveyor belts and ramps sorting and moving packages between the airstrip and 22 HGV docking bays – is quiet.

It comes alive at night when six Boeing B767-300F jets drop off and collect that day's shipments.

Flights come in from Cologne Edinburgh Belfast and Philadelphia bringing parcels destined for the parcel company’s 70-or-so UK centres. From there they are delivered to homes and pick up points up and down the country.

The site mainly handles small packages up to around 80kg with clients ranging from people buying goods online or posting things overseas to big fashion companies and online retailers sending things to customers in the UK.

During the first lockdown staff said there was a big rise in the number of toys and even toilet rolls being shipped in. Since then the UPS workforce has helped move millions of items of PPE equipment and sent some 600 million vaccines – which will grow to 1 billion by the end of the year – to Europe North America and a number of developing countries.

In all the hub employs 640 people mainly split between twilight and sunset shifts – operating at night means parcels can be processed and shipped for next day delivery.

The new hub has replaced a much smaller site just up the road and Jim O'Gara UPS UK president for the UK Ireland and the Nordic countries said despite being more automated there were no jobs lost.

The 58-year-old – who started as a driver with the business 26 years ago – told BusinessLive he particularly wanted the new UK air hub to support small businesses looking for new cross-border customers.

Attending the official launch of the hub he said: ""This is the second-largest gateway we have in Europe second to Cologne and re-emphasises the confidence we have in the UK economy.

""We have spent a significant amount of money and there are 650 jobs here. We came from a building nearby that was not automated to one that is completely automated and rather than losing people we are training up workers.

""The control room here is something like NASA and the security protocols are state-of-the so that we can screen every single package that goes on our aircraft to protect not only our people but the public at large.""

Mr O'Gara said the pandemic had accelerated the rise of online shopping encouraging a new older generation of shoppers to use the internet to shop and said UPS was making that easier by launching more drop and collection points in British convenience stores.

He said the business had also streamlined export processes to make it easier for individuals and businesses sending products to and from Europe to deal with new post-Brexit paperwork reports BusinessLive.

He said: ""We're almost nine months into the year and are seeing business move at a pace that was more akin to where it was before Brexit.""

Mr O'Gara said the UK HGV driver shortage affecting some businesses had not hit UPS because of its policy of promoting from within and encouraging the workforce to train and move up the ladder.

UPS had global sales of $84.6 billion last year and operates in more than 220 countries with more than 540000 employees worldwide.

It launched in Seattle 114 years ago and today has its global headquarters in Atlanta Georgia with UPS AIrlines based in Louisville Kentucky.",,,,,,

From the iconic conglomerates to the popular automotive brands the US and China dominate much of the top 10 largest businesses.

According to Fortune's annual ""Global 500"" study these two countries make up 80 per cent of the list reports The CEO Magazine.

Collectively the biggest companies in the world were responsible for$31.7 trillion in 2021 4.8% less from 2020 – which was a record high of$33.3 trillion.

While the pandemic led to a decrease in collective revenue it saw a record number of women running the Global 500 businesses.

In 2020 just 14 female CEOs were at the helm of large conglomerates. In 2021 that number grew to 23 – the highest figure recorded since Fortune began the annual research in 2014.

Companies across energy beverages finance transport automotive technology materials telecom wholesalers and retailers were among the most prolific globally.

Below are the 10 biggest companies of 2021.

The country’s health care has been propped up by aid from international donors. But after the Taliban seized power the World Bank and other organizations froze $600 million in health care aid. The Biden administration too is struggling with how to dispense donor money to a country now being run by several senior Taliban leaders whom the United States has designated to be terrorists.

If World Bank funding is not restored quickly an exodus of health care workers may result. Many have remained on the job despite significant personal risks; already some have not been paid for months. Along with the loss of supplies the cutoff would effectively end health care services in 31 of the nation’s 34 provinces humanitarian groups say.

Afghanistan is already on the brink of universal poverty according to a United Nations report on Thursday and only its richest citizens will be able to afford health care. Assuming that health care coverage is cut by half because of the funding loss deaths among women and children will increase by at least 33 percent over the next year — nearly 2000 women and more than 26000 children per year — according to one analysis.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNmY2hyb25pY2xlLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL29wZW5mb3J1bS9hcnRpY2xlL0FzaWFuLUFtZXJpY2Fucy1hcmVuLXQtZ2V0dGluZy10aGUtaGVhbHRoLWNhcmUtMTY0NDc2NDcucGhw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Asian Americans aren't getting the health care they need.

This gorgeous country boasts beautiful natural landscapes outstanding biodiversity and a mild climate — all within a short flight from the United States. And its healthcare system is frequently cited as one of the most comprehensive and affordable in the world something that’s always top of mind for retirees. In fact Costa Rica’s system is ranked 36th in the world by the World Health Organization above the United States Cuba and New Zealand.

If you’re dreaming of retirement in paradise these are some important things to know about healthcare in Costa Rica.

1. Costa Rica Introduced Public Healthcare In The 1940s

Universal health insurance has deep roots in Costa Rica. It’s been a part of Costa Rican culture for about 75 years and citizens are understandably proud of what their country has accomplished.

However while the system is indeed comprehensive and affordable it’s far from perfect. Common complaints surround bureaucratic red tape long wait times that just seem to get longer and a gap in the standards of care between urban and rural facilities. In particular many rural facilities are very basic and long overdue for an upgrade in infrastructure diagnostic equipment and even staffing levels. Expats moving to Costa Rica may find that healthcare facilities are more crowded and less private than what they’re used to.

2. There Are Private And Public Options

The public healthcare system in Costa Rica is nicknamed “La Caja” a short form of “Caja Costarricense de Seguro Social” or the “CCSS.” It is funded primarily through payroll taxes. The rate you pay is based on income and averages 7percent–11 percent.

In addition to “La Caja” there is a second system known as “INS.” This is short for “Instituto de Seguro Nacional.” It is a form of private health insurance run by the Costa Rican government. People who chose INS can expect coverage for dental work optometry and annual check-ups. They’re also allowed to visit private hospitals and clinics.

3. Expats Are Part Of The System

It’s not just Costa Rican citizens who are part of the public healthcare system. Anyone with residency papers must become part of La Caja. It’s important to note that this applies to expats with legal resident status (such as those in a residency program like pensionado or rentista). Just because you visit the country each year and think of yourself as “living” in Costa Rica part-time doesn’t mean you’re a legal resident.

Not all expats with residency status like the idea of mandatory enrollment in La Caja. If you’re already planning to carry private insurance from a company at home it can seem like unnecessary paperwork to enroll in a system you don’t plan on using. But there are a lot of benefits to the program. A big one is cost. Many private hospitals demand large cash payments upfront before you are admitted. They don’t automatically bill every private insurance company directly putting some patients in a tight financial situation. However public emergency room visits are free of charge and there are only minor costs associated with some incidental expenses (like purchasing items like a knee brace.)

4. Patients Can Mix Things Up

In some countries public healthcare or private healthcare is a definitive choice. You must be in one program or another. It’s different in Costa Rica where many people (including expats) opt to mix both. La Caja is popular because the costs are low and there is a strong emphasis on preventative care and community wellness. The INS is well regarded because there are shorter waiting times and good access to a wide range of specialists. Happily the two systems (usually) work well together. It’s common for patients to have their x-rays done at a private facility to avoid a long wait and then have the results sent to their regular doctor in the public system. On the other side specialists working in the INS system know to write their prescriptions for La Caja- based pharmacies as their patients will save money.

Patients can also carry their own private health insurance via an independent company that’s not the INS. This is pretty common among expats who often have insurance with their work benefits or another professional association. Note that if you use this kind of private insurance you usually have to pay upfront for all care and then get reimbursed later.

5. Costs Are Reasonable (But Not Always Free)

Citizens and legal residents have 100 percent coverage for all medical procedures appointments hospital visits and prescription drugs through La Caja. However there may be some minor incidental costs for non-prescription products (like vitamins) and possibly administrative requests (like having a complicated form filled out for work.)

Patients who are not part of La Caja (like tourists and short-term expats) will find that healthcare costs in Costa Rica are very reasonable compared to other countries. Most doctor visits and diagnostic tests like ultrasounds and routine blood work are under $100 (and sometimes much much less.) In fact routine checkups to complex surgeries costs are generally 25 percent to 33 percent of the price a similar procedure would cost in the United States. But remember when it comes to complex procedures 25 percent of a huge bill is still in fact a pretty big bill! Many expats who don’t really feel the need for a lot of healthcare but who also want to guard against unexpected bills can opt for an insurance plan that has a high deductible and low premiums. That way they’re covered for any serious situations but take on the costs of day-to-day health matters.

6. Understanding Health Discount Plans

There’s public healthcare government-run private healthcare independent private healthcare…. and then there are health discount plans! Here’s what that term means.

As mentioned above the La Caja and INS systems work well together. This is thanks in part to the fact that doctors know both systems well because they work in both systems. Many doctors who work in the public healthcare system also run their own part-time private practices. A patient who isn’t enrolled in INS can still see a doctor in private practice but they’ll have to pay. However a health discount plan makes these visits more economical. For a monthly fee patients get discounted appointments blood tests x-rays and other diagnostic services. It’s a good choice for patients who know they need to see their doctor regularly and want continuity of care with the same physician regardless of whether the setting is a public or private one.

7. Going To The Doctor Might Actually Mean Going To the Pharmacist

What’s more efficient than the public and private systems combined? Often it’s a trip to the neighborhood pharmacy. In non-emergency situations this is usually the most efficient choice. Pharmacists are authorized to give consultations make medical recommendations and refer patients to other caregivers (like a specialist or emergency room doctor) as needed. Pharmacists play a crucial role in Costa Rica’s healthcare system are afforded a high degree of esteem and are often called “doctora” as a sign of respect.

8. And Sometimes Going To The Doctor Means The Doctor Goes To You

Amazingly house calls still exist and they play a big role in Costa Rica’s medical system. The next step up from visiting a pharmacist for non-urgent medical concerns is to visit one of Costa Rica’s small public community clinics known as EBAIS. Some EBAIS schedule in-clinic appointments by an online program. Others use the old-fashioned first-come first served method. But medical team members also see patients via house calls. They follow up on previous visits to monitor patients’ progress. And they even fulfill public health mandates doing everything from checking up on vaccination records to addressing housing needs to assessing the health of pets. All around they do amazing work!

Realme llegó decidió llegar a Europa primero a través de España en octubre de 2019. Unos meses más tarde llegó la pandemia global. ¿Cómo le ha ido a Realme en España y Europa desde 2019 a 2021? ¿Os ha frenado de alguna manera el coronavirus?

""No no realmente. Nunca hemos reducido los costes de nuestra expansión y de hecho los hemos aumentado porque hemos contratado a mucha gente en cada país en los que estamos presente desde marketing a todas las demás áreas. Queríamos asegurarnos de que no usamos la pandemia como excusa para reducir costes y en su lugar lo hemos visto como una oportunidad para seguir creciendo"".

La tecnología es para las masas no para las clases y ese es el principio que seguimos para desarrollar nuestros productos. Queremos que haya un producto de Realme para cualquier tipo de usuario"".

Ahora que hay cada vez más gente vacunada y que la pandemia remite poco a poco ¿qué crees que va a pasar en el mercado?

""Creo que definitivamente va a cambiar y es una de las razones por las que estoy aquí en Madrid. Los encuentros personales físicos hacen que todo sea diferente. Ahora podremos conocer en persona a nuestros clientes y esto es importante porque quizá hasta ahora entendían el producto y el precio pero ahora podrán entender también la marca y nuestra visión"".

De hecho muchos de nosotros quizá conozcamos solo a Realme por los smartphones pero ahora mismo tenéis relojes aspirador e incluso un portátil. ¿Cómo planificáis vuestra estrategia de productos? ¿Por qué decidís lanzar un portátil y no otra cosa?

""Tenemos claro que vamos seguir con nuestra estrategia de 1 + 5 + T en todos los países en los que estamos presentes es decir primero aterrizamos en un territorio con nuestros smartphones. Arrancamos con smartphones de gama de entrada y media y poco a poco vamos completando nuestro portfolio con nuestro enfoque en desempeño y diseño. Queremos asegurarnos de que le damos al consumidor lo mejor de esas opciones por el mejor precio del mercado"".

""El segundo paso es traer más productos del ecosistema como relojes televisores o nuestra Realme Pad. Más adelante cuando el mercado está más asentado el siguiente paso es traer productos de lifestyle como nuestro TechLife Robot Vacuum"".

¿Y cómo sabéis que productos de segmentos nuevos para vosotros son competitivos en el mercado si no tenéis experiencia previa?

""La competencia no va solo sobre el precio. La competencia va entre otras cosas sobre especificaciones. La tecnología no es vender un producto al precio que sea sino vender una experiencia a un precio determinado. Sabemos las expectativas que tiene la comunidad sobre un producto y en torno a un rango de precio concreto. Lo que tratamos de hacer es ofrecer diferentes opciones a los usuarios para que puedan elegir la que más les conviene en función de esa expectativa de precio que tienen"".

""Creemos en la economía de escalas. Si logramos que una tecnología sea masiva entonces el coste para los consumidores va a ser mucho menor""

¿Cómo planeáis convencer a la gente que compre un portátil de una marca que quizás ni conozcan?

""Es por esa misma razón por la que quiero que los consumidores tengan la oportunidad de probar nuestros productos antes de comprarlos y estamos trabajando con socios en España para poder hacer demos en tienda. Pero sobre todo mirando las cifras tan sólidas que tenemos en el mercado smartphone y las buenas experiencias que están teniendo nuestros usuarios estamos seguros de que querrán probar otros productos nuestros que no sean smartphones"".

Tener un portfolio de productos cada vez mayor implica tener también cada vez más competidores. ¿Sois capaces de competir en tantos frentes?

""Creo que la competencia es extremadamente importante para el mercado. No creo que debamos estar preocupados por ninguna marca de la competencia. En nuestro caso hace que nos esforcemos aún más por ofrecer la mejor tecnología al mejor precio. Si no existiera la competencia una empresa podría vender cualquier tecnología a cualquier precio y eso sería malo para todos"".

Os referís al Realme GT como vuestro ""flagship killer"" y en nuestra review vimos que es muy bueno en potencia autonomía y tasa de refresco pero podría hacer mejor en cámaras y sonido. ¿Quizá el precio de ser bueno en todo es precisamente ser más caro? ¿Planeáis subir más los precios de vuestros teléfonos en el futuro?

""Todo depende de la tecnología. Nunca tomamos decisiones en torno al precio sino a la tecnología que queremos incorporar. Por ejemplo queríamos lanzar una pantalla con 120 Hz o la compatibilidad con nuestra carga magnética o MagDart. Una vez que tenemos clara la tecnología entonces vemos a qué precio podemos ofrecerla"".

""Creemos en la economía de escalas. Si logramos que una tecnología sea masiva entonces el coste para los consumidores va a ser mucho menor"".

¿Qué nueva tecnología crees que va a ser de gran impacto para los consumidores próximamente?

""Cualquiera que sea útil y práctica porque eso hace que la tecnología perdure y se use a lo largo del tiempo. Para mí son los dos pilares fundamentales para cualquier nueva tecnología"".

¿Como por ejemplo?

""Cualquiera que ahorre tiempo al consumidor. Por ejemplo nuestras soluciones de carga rápida con las que puedes cargar un teléfono por completo en 14 minutos. Ese es el tipo de valor que queremos llevar a los consumidores"".

¿Cómo ves el futuro de los relojes inteligentes y de los wearables? ¿Cómo crees que deben evolucionar?

""Ya han evolucionado bastante y mucha gente los está utilizando para hacer deporte por ejemplo aunque sea para contar los pasos y creo que habrá más y más cosas que la gente va a empezar a hacer con los wearables. Creo que el foco de desarrollo de los wearables debe centrarse en la velocidad de la experiencia de usuario que puedas hacer más cosas y más rápido"".",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVsZGlhcmlvLmVzL2Vjb25vbWlhL2RpcmVjdG9yLXZlbnRhcy1oZWluZWtlbi1zaS1zdWJlLWNlc3RhLWNvbXByYS1nZW50ZS1zYWxkcmEtY2FuYXNfMV84Mjg5MTMzLmh0bWzSAXRodHRwczovL3d3dy5lbGRpYXJpby5lcy9lY29ub21pYS9kaXJlY3Rvci12ZW50YXMtaGVpbmVrZW4tc2ktc3ViZS1jZXN0YS1jb21wcmEtZ2VudGUtc2FsZHJhLWNhbmFzXzFfODI4OTEzMy5hbXAuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"El director de ventas de Heineken: ""Si sube la cesta de la compra la gente saldrá menos de cañas""","Manuel Román director de ventas del grupo Heineken en España esperaba un verano mejor. “El año pasado hubo un confinamiento duro y todo fue muy chocante pero no hubo restricciones a la hostelería. Este año empezó la quinta ola a mediados de julio y algunos países restringieron la movilidad. Los británicos son importantes porque beben mucha cerveza. No hemos recuperado el nivel de 2019 nos quedaremos en un 10% de caída”.

Lo peor de la pandemia ya pasó para las cerveceras que durante meses perdieron millones de ventas en el canal hostelero y no compensaron con el consumo en el hogar. Es un hecho: la gente no bebe tanta cerveza en casa como en la calle. Pero siendo un sector tan dependiente del turismo hasta que este no vuelva del todo no estarán al 100%. En conversación con elDiario.es Román explica cómo ha evolucionado el consumo y qué esperan de cara a la recuperación.







Heineken —propietaria de Cruzcampo Amstel El Águila Desperados Guiness y Paulaner— volvió a dar beneficios en el primer semestre de 2021: 1.034 millones de euros a nivel global frente a los 290 millones de pérdidas en el mismo período de 2020. La compañía anunció un recorte de 8.000 empleos en todo el mundo por la bajada de ventas que en España se tradujo en un ERE de 228 personas. “No fueron salidas dramáticas sino salidas pactadas de gente de determinada edad” puntualiza. El grupo acordó prejubilaciones con los sindicatos y espera volver el año que viene a la “tasa de contratación habitual”. Antes del ERE la plantilla española superaba las 1.600 personas.







Ahora el sector se enfrenta a ese viejo fantasma llamado inflación. Le afecta por partida doble: por la subida de las materias primas que redundará en el precio de la cerveza y por su impacto sobre el consumo. Los efectos que provocan los actuales aumentos de precio de las materias primas ya los hemos visto en otros ámbitos. Los ganaderos presionaron a los supermercados para que subieran tres céntimos el litro de leche y así poder cubrir costes. Lo lograron. El aumento del coste de los materiales de construcción se refleja en los precios de las reformas y según voces del mercado si sigue así redundará en la vivienda nueva.

“La inflación nos preocupa. El alza de las materias primas afecta a los aprovisionamientos: nuestros proveedores usan electricidad que ha subido y el transporte se ha multiplicado por diez” dice. ¿Cuánto subirán los botellines y las cañas? El IPC se ha disparado en España al 33% su máximo en casi una década debido al alza en los precios de la electricidad si bien las bebidas alcohólicas aún no registran subidas.

“Ahora mismo estamos viendo internamente cómo manejarlo teniendo en cuenta las proyecciones para el año que viene” indica el director de ventas. “Todos los años hay una subida de tarifas íntimamente ligada al IPC. Veremos cómo pinta a final de año cómo afecta a nuestras materias primas y en base a eso qué subida proponemos. Ese es el precio que se ve en los lineales del supermercado porque los bares ajustan el precio en función de sus decisiones particulares”.

Eso por un lado. Por otro Román asume que la inflación repercutirá en el consumo. “La cesta de la compra subirá el año que viene. Subirá el precio de la electricidad. En teoría el poder adquisitivo del español va a reducirse y esto puede tener un efecto de contracción de la demanda en hostelería. Porque salir a cenar o tomarse unas cañas es... un lujo accesible. Si sube la cesta la gente se centrará en los bienes básicos y en servicios de los que no pueda prescindir no en eso” sostiene.

Cervezas y sodas 'cool'

Hace tiempo que Heineken como otras grandes marcas se subió al carro de las cervezas artesanas. En 2018 adquirió el 51% de la madrileña La Cibeles y poco antes de empezar la pandemia lanzó una nueva marca El Águila que sin ser artesana pura sí tiene “un componente craft”. Con este lanzamiento Heineken recuperó una marca que ella misma había eliminado del mercado en 1984 cuando compró la empresa El Águila (cervecería nacida en Madrid en el año 1900) y la reconvirtió en Águila Amstel primero y en Amstel a secas después.

“En ese momento la tendencia eran las marcas globales. Hoy eso ha cambiado: se llevan las marcas de aquí el kilómetro 0 y producto local. Vimos que era el momento idóneo para sacar de la nevera esa marca con reminiscencias del pasado tanto en su receta como en su imagen” añade el directivo sin ocultar que el trabajo de los pequeños cerveceros les ha beneficiado indirectamente porque ha generado “cultura”.

A las grandes cerveceras les llega ahora un nuevo competidor. Se llama hard seltzer que en español vendría ser “soda dura” o “agua con gas dura”. Es una moda estadounidense para vender alcohol como si fuera un refresco que genera dudas respecto a su etiquetado porque en ocasiones se atribuye propiedades saludables (y ninguna bebida alcohólica lo es).

“Es un agua saborizada con gas y con una chispa de alcohol. Es lo que busca el consumidor de hoy: pocos carbohidratos pocas calorías y poco alcohol” dice Román. Coca-Cola ha lanzado por primera vez una bebida alcohólica (Topo Chico) bajo esta categoría. Heineken también se ha subido con Pura Piraña muy presente en el mercado mexicano y en proceso de expandirse en España. “Hemos hecho un lanzamiento pequeño táctico en pequeñas tiendas de barrio. Estamos probando a ver qué tal. Puede tener su hueco no lo sé. Pero de momento no está rompiendo”.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pbGVuaW8uY29tL2N1bHR1cmEvdGVqZWRvcmVzLXBhbG1hLWVuZnJlbnRhbi1iYWphcy12ZW50YXMtcnVtYm8tMTUtc2VwdGllbWJyZdIBWmh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLm1pbGVuaW8uY29tL2N1bHR1cmEvdGVqZWRvcmVzLXBhbG1hLWVuZnJlbnRhbi1iYWphcy12ZW50YXMtcnVtYm8tMTUtc2VwdGllbWJyZQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tejedores de la tradición se enfrentan a bajas ventas con la pandemia,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.milenio.com/cultura/tejedores-palma-enfrentan-bajas-ventas-rumbo-15-septiembre on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pbGVuaW8uY29tL2N1bHR1cmEvdGVqZWRvcmVzLXBhbG1hLWVuZnJlbnRhbi1iYWphcy12ZW50YXMtcnVtYm8tMTUtc2VwdGllbWJyZdIBWmh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLm1pbGVuaW8uY29tL2N1bHR1cmEvdGVqZWRvcmVzLXBhbG1hLWVuZnJlbnRhbi1iYWphcy12ZW50YXMtcnVtYm8tMTUtc2VwdGllbWJyZQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVsZXNwYW5vbC5jb20vY3VsdHVyYS8yMDIxMDkxMi9jb2xhcy1lbnRyYXItdmVudGFzLWNvdmlkLWZlcmlhLWxpYnJvLWRlc21hZHJhLzYxMTE4OTYzMV8wLmh0bWzSAW5odHRwczovL3d3dy5lbGVzcGFub2wuY29tL2N1bHR1cmEvMjAyMTA5MTIvY29sYXMtZW50cmFyLXZlbnRhcy1jb3ZpZC1mZXJpYS1saWJyby1kZXNtYWRyYS82MTExODk2MzFfMC5hbXAuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Colas de dos horas para entrar y más ventas que antes del Covid: la Feria del Libro se desmadra,"Noticias relacionadas Todo lo que tienes que saber de la Feria del Libro de Madrid más esperada

—¿Ya no está Enrique? —pregunta una señora con gesto asfixiado que se asoma a la caseta de la editorial Renacimiento en busca de una firma de Enrique Gallud Jardiel autor de Cómo ser culto en diez días.

—Se acaba de marchar —le contesta la editora Christina Linares—. Pero espera un segundo que le voy a llamar para ver si sigue por aquí y se puede acercar.

La señora dice que viene de Cuenca y que lleva dos horas haciendo cola una cola que serpentea desde antes del monumento al general Martínez Campos dobla en la Puerta de Madrid y baja estrecha e impaciente por el Paseo de Fernán Núñez más de un kilómetro en total hasta llegar a la entrada de la Feria del Libro que en esta edición número ochenta presenta un nunca visto: control de aforo con vallas y unos números rojos que este sábado por la tarde llegaban al 99%. No cabía nadie más solo 3.900 personas a la vez.

Hubo suerte. Gallud Jardiel aparece de repente de la nada y firma el ejemplar que le reclaman. Pero muchos de los que querían garabato y saludo de J. J. Benítez Blue Jeans María Dueñas Eloy Moreno o Miguel Ángel Revilla los más demandados no habrán sido tan afortunados. La Feria del Libro del reencuentro tras la pandemia la que dicen los autores que es la más especial de todas es la que más paciencia reparte: filas enormes para entrar al recinto de las casetas y más filas dentro para los cazadedicatorias.

El control de acceso desconcierta a los propios escritores. Santiago Posteguillo acelerado y perdido como un legionario romano que acaba de colgar el gladius y no sabe muy bien qué hacer pregunta escondido tras una visera que dónde está la entrada de los autores que llega tarde a firmar. Va hablando por teléfono y diciendo que le queda nada que no se preocupen que no se va a presentar tarde a la batalla con los lectores en la que le acompaña Sandra Barneda la finalista del último Planeta y presentadora de La isla de las tentaciones a la que le piden más fotos que firmas.

María Dueñas firmando ejemplares de sus novelas este sábado. Efe

Es extraño porque es otoño y no primavera y el Retiro está lleno de libros y casetas —menos que en años anteriores— más de dos años después otra vez de ilusión. Pero el cambio de fechas provoca un efecto novedoso: los estantes de librerías y editoriales están cargados de las nuevas publicaciones de la rentrée tras el verano: Fernando Aramburu y Los vencejos (Tusquets) Manuel Vilas y Los besos (Planeta) Julia Navarro y De ninguna parte (Plaza & Janés) Antonio Muñoz Molina y Volver a dónde (Seix Barral) etcétera.

Quizá eso explica un síntoma que han percibido algunos libreros en los dos primeros días de feria: que la cosa va muy bien que se está vendiendo mucho incluso más que en las ediciones anteriores a la pandemia cuando lo del aforo del 75% no estaba ni siquiera en las novelas y en el medio del paseo no se ponían las casetas en las que muchos no reparan ante la resignación de los implicados.

La salud del libro más allá de este certamen del que tantas ganas había parece muy buena. Un informe presentado esta semana en el Fórum Edita de Barcelona presagiaba un incremento de hasta el 23% del sector a finales de año. El mundo editorial está despegando tras el bache de la pandemia y no hace más falta que pasearse por la Feria del Libro de Madrid ante la que ya se anunciaban golosos augurios para comprobar que los números son una realidad palpable."

Let the family know you are thinking of them

Mick Smith

Mick Smith 74 passed away at Howard County General Hospital in Columbia Md. with his family by his side on Tuesday September 7 2021.

Michael Edward Smith 'Mick' was born in Washington DC on August 4 1947 to the late Edward E. and Corale E. (Pilgrim) Smith. Mick was raised in Montgomery County graduating from Wheaton HS (65'). During college he started his much-loved career of 40+ years in the Bell System/Verizon Corp. starting as a lineman on up to Director of Sales for Verizon Wireless.

Mick is survived by his wife of 38 years Pat (Bender) Smith his beloved children; Amy (Jay) McClenahan Sykesville MD; Jake Smith (Dr. Stephanie Kahntroff) Lutherville MD.; cherished grandchildren; Kory Libby Tucker and Colton. He will be forever remembered by many family members and friends.

Mick loved his life! A daily runner he enjoyed watching coaching and playing many sports throughout his life. Mick loved the outdoors traveling and spending time at his cottage on Seneca Lake NY. He took multiple road trips across the country enjoyed cruises and island hopping. His biggest joy was time spent with his family especially participating in his grandchildren's lives.

Friends and Family are invited to a memorial gathering at Haight Funeral Home 6416 Sykesville Road Sykesville MD on Saturday September 18 from 4-6 pm. Interment will be held at Seneca Union Cemetary Valois NY at a later date.

Donations in Mick's Memory can be made to the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society or by donating blood or platelets to your local Red Cross.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBjZ2FtZXIuY29tL2FsYW4td2FrZS1yZW1hc3RlcmVkLXdpbGwtc2NydWItYWxsLXRoYXQtcHJvZHVjdC1wbGFjZW1lbnQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Alan Wake Remastered will scrub all that product placement,"Looks like the upcoming release of Alan Wake Remastered won't have all that product placement littering the region of Bright Falls and Remedy has confirmed that to be the case. The original game had lots precisely-branded objects like billboards from cell phone provider Verizon and both a flashlight and batteries by Energizer. The flashlight and collecting batteries were key to the game: You had to use them to stave off dangerous darkness.

A PR rep for Alan Wake Remastered confirmed to Screen Rant that the new game won't have any of the brand placement of the old game. So no Verizon Energizer Ford or Lincoln. Those deals have long since expired.

Instead we can probably look forward to some very Remedy-esque fake products TV Shows commercials and songs littered with both jokes and hints towards future games. We saw a lot of that in Control and with a supposed Alan Wake 2 on the horizon we're almost inevitably going to see hints that tie the first game into the second.

Except they'll probably be new hints from ten years later not stuff that was in the 2010 release. Presumably this release is definitive Remedy Connected Universe canon? My head hurts now. I am going to think about something else before they change more stuff.

RALEIGH N.C. (WTVD) -- A mural on an outside wall of the Happy & Hale restaurant in North Hills caught the eyes of many as they walked to and from a block party in North Hills.

Bold red letters on a stark white background declared: Kindness is cool.

Artist Jon Leonardo said ""The whole idea behind this is there are smiles behind all the masks right? Kindness is free it's something anyone can do. And we thought art was a really great way to get out that message.""

RELATED: Meet the Raleigh artist whose work you've seen but whose name you've likely never heard

Leonardo's mural is supported by the restaurant North Hills and Verizon. That company's representative said Raleigh is a smart choice for an art installation like this.

""Small town community. We wanted something that would be impactful for a town like this"" said Verizon representative Allison Stevens.

Leonardo said he fell in love with North Carolina and Raleigh in particular while attending school at Elon University.

""Five years ago work took me out to Los Angeles"" he said. ""So it's been so fun to come back here in Raleigh to actually paint something and have something in the city.""

Leonardo said he hopes the mural remains for as long as possible.

""And then people can enjoy it"" he added.

Would I need a labour card to continue working at my firm? Will the firm continue giving me health insurance?

Answer: Pursuant to your queries we assume that you are employed by a mainland firm in Dubai. Therefore the provisions of Federal Law No. 8 of 1980 Regulating Employment Relations in the UAE (Employment Law) and the provisions of Law No. 11 of 2013 Concerning Health Insurance in the Emirate of Dubai (Dubai Health Insurance Law) shall be applicable.

The UAE Cabinet Resolution No. 56 of 2018 allows a foreign national to obtain long-term residency visa (Golden Visa) in the UAE. We assume that you are eligible for it based on your profession. It should be noted that the Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation (MOHRE) issued a statement on July 1 2021 confirming that private sector employees who are eligible for the Golden Visa need to have a work permit. The provisions of the Employment Law are applicable to such employees.

An employee holding a Golden Visa needs to have a work permit from the MOHRE to be employed by a private firm or entity. It is the responsibility of an employer to provide health insurance to its employees in Dubai. This is in accordance with Article 10 of the Dubai Health Insurance Law which states: ""The employer shall be obliged to do the following:

1. Provide health insurance coverage for employees in accordance with the health insurance policy applicable.

2. Bear the costs for such health insurance coverage rather than making the beneficiaries bear such costs.

3. Verify that the health insurance of the employees is valid for the length of their work period.

4. Bear the health services and medical intervention costs in emergencies for any of the employees if any of them has no health insurance in accordance with the provisions of this law.

5. Give employees their health insurance cards.

6. Provide the health insurance policy upon the employees' residence issuance or renewal.

7. Any other obligations specified by the authority pursuant to the resolutions issued.""

Further Article 96 of the Employment Law states: ""The employer must provide employees with means of medical care according to the standards decided by the MOHRE in collaboration with the Ministry of Health.”

Therefore based on these provisions your employer must provide you with health insurance during the period of your employment. Article 23 of the Dubai Health Insurance Law states that if an employer fails to provide health insurance the authority concerned or the Dubai Health Authority (DHA) may impose penalties ranging from Dh500 to Dh150000. If the employer violates this law repeatedly penalties may reach Dh500000.

The city of Detroit started a mentor/mentee program called SisterFriends that matches up first-time mothers with other mothers with babies and toddlers to help talk and guide them through being a mom. Barber and her mentee Rebecca Margavich 38 of Berkley met up on Zoom back in the fall of 2020 and have had regular talks and have met up twice in person since the birth of Calliope. Eric Seals Detroit Free Press

Five years ago Sierra Barber was diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome a hormonal imbalance that causes problems in the reproductive organs.

Her doctors she said told her that if she ever was able to conceive she would always have problems trying to carry a baby to full term. At the time Barber was just 27 years old.

And in 2018 two years after her diagnosis Barber's worst nightmare happened.

“I had a miscarriage when I was six weeks pregnant” she said. “And it was really hard because I really wanted to have a baby.”

In 2020 Barber became pregnant again. But this time she decided to join a support group so she could make sure she had all the resources she needed so she could see her little bundle of joy come into the world.

SisterFriends is a program provided by the city of Detroit for mothers who are expecting for the first time. Its primary goal is to help reduce the infant mortality and morbidity rate for African American babies in the city said project coordinator Tahira Khalid.

“We have found that it is not just the financial issue that causes babies to die or be born ill"" said Khalid who also serves as the program's social worker. “It is the stress and structural racism and so many other things that operate against our families to have a good birth outcome. And so we have decided to add an element of support with the SisterFriends program.”

In addition to reducing infant deaths in the city SisterFriends also helps address any lack of resources the expecting mom and/or family may have in addition to providing expecting moms with a volunteer mentor to help guide them through their pregnancy as well as assisting new moms after the baby is born up until the child turns 1 year old.

Barber’s mentor Rebecca Margavich 36 joined the program last year and said it was one of the best decisions she ever made. She refers to her little sister/mentee as a mom who has super powers.

“She is a wonder woman” Margavich said. “I've learned a lot just knowing that she does a lot of the things that she does on her own and I think that's just unbelievable ... it's incredible. And It just shows the strength of a woman and a mother.”

Margavich who is a mother of a 2-year-old boy said she joined the program because she understands that motherhood is a community and you need that support especially as a new mom. In the beginning Margavich said she checked in on Barber at least once a week by phone because COVID-19 precautions meant the two were not able to meet in person. But since the mentee/mentorship began she and her little sister’s relationship organically developed and now they talk almost every other day.

“We are now lifelong friends” Margavich said.

The program’s coordinator said that the friendship between Margavich and Barber is just one of the many that have been cultivated during the four years the program has been operating. And that with the way things are going in the program Khalid said she expects to see many more of these relationships develop.

SisterFriends is funded by the Michigan Department of Human Services as well as some city funds and grant dollars according to the city. The program also works in conjunction with other city programs such as Safe Sleep Father's Forward and 961 Baby. And while the program does not have a specific budget because each case is different the funds are put to good use Khalid said. Besides the mentoring and guidance and moral support for expectant and new mothers the program also celebrates the new moms and babies with baby showers and birthday parties once the child turns 1 year old.

In May Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan announced that the infant mortality rate in the city in 2019 was the lowest it had been in more than 20 years. According to data from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services Detroit's infant mortality rate dived from 16.7 deaths per 1000 live births in 2018 to 11 per 1000 live births in 2019 a one-third rate reduction.

And while 2020’s numbers on the city's infant mortality rate have not yet been released Barber who is now 32 is hoping that her new baby girl will only add to a further decline in those numbers. And for her she attributes part of that success to SisterFriends.

“I call her my rainbow baby” Barber said referring to the phrase created to refer to a baby born after a miscarriage stillbirth or loss from natural causes. The word rainbow specifically is metaphoric speaking to the beauty that can appear after the darkness of a storm. “I look at her as the spirit that lived in me before. And Thursday she turned 9 months old.”

Ward (The Black Dagger Brotherhood) and Christine Feehan (the Carpathian novels) are two queens of paranormal romance best known for their action-packed vampire series. Both have now broken the mold with exciting new books. Other outstanding recent romances include a hilarious LGBTQ royal romp and a modern take on Little Women.

Claimed J.R. Ward (Gallery Books $10).

Claimed is the first in Ward’s Lair of the Wolven series. Lydia Susi is a scientist working for the Wolf Study Project in upstate New York. The book opens with her discovering a gray wolf in the woods just as it collapses apparently another victim of animal poisonings that the WSP staff has been finding in the area. Lydia has her suspicions that the poisonings are connected to the luxury resort going up across the valley.

She and the vet rush the wolf back to the clinic where Lydia is informed that an applicant for a job opening has arrived. Daniel Joseph turns out to be an eyeful. He’s eventually hired as a handyman.

He and Lydia find themselves drawn to each other especially as alarming incidents start happening. As they investigate the poisonings they find themselves caught in a web of danger.

With Claimed Ward takes you on a wild ride full of twists and turns. You are left with a cliff-hanger cursing that you have to wait until the next book to find out what happens next. Members of the Brotherhood clan also make an appearance with Xhex featured in her own mysterious story line that will intersect with that of Lydia and Daniel.

Murder at Sunrise Lake Christine Feehan. (Berkley $28).

In Christine Feehan’s first stand-alone novel in nearly 20 years Stella Harrison has found a busy but peaceful life as owner of the Sunrise Lake Resort. She has a set of good friends she has made in the small resort town in the Sierra Nevada mountains but none of them know about her troubled past as the daughter of a serial killer who was put away because of her special psychic powers.

Now years later Stella is having prescient nightmares again about another killer. She knows a fisherman is going to be targeted near the lake but not exactly where.

Sam Rossi her handyman notices she’s upset. He is a man of few words and fewer emotions but he is observant and capable and there is a simmering attraction between them. Stella confides in him.

He turns out to be ex-military and basically has a special set of skills and he promises to keep her safe.

As the two try to learn more about the killer they find themselves in more and more danger. Stella is not sure whom she can trust — suspicions have even been raised about Sam. But she knows she must count on his help and their growing love.

Playing the Palace Paul Rudnick (Berkley $16).

At the start of this wickedly funny and witty LGBTQ romance Carter Ogden is still getting over a bad breakup with his cheating boyfriend. Depressed that he is nearing 30 and still single and underemployed — though he loves his job staging events — he goes to his favorite spot in New York. At St. Patrick’s Cathedral he can talk to God about what is deep in his heart even though he is a Jewish boy from New Jersey.

His heart unburdened he heads to the United Nations where his company is setting up an event for the Royal Clean Water Initiative headed by international dreamboat Prince Edgar of Britain.

Before the event Carter shares a moment of connection with the openly gay crown prince before the prince’s staff arrive and whisk him away. Carter is surprised when days later he gets a phone call from Edgar’s aide who says the prince is inviting him to dinner.

A picnic lunch follows and then Carter invites Edgar to his sister’s wedding where the royal makes a big stir at Temple Beth Israel in Piscataway. But the next day a hacked photo of them topless and sitting on a bed goes viral.

Carter is invited to England where he has to deal with an intrusive press scheming royals and a delightfully formidable Queen Catherine.

Playing the Palace is a bit light on the actual romance — we don’t really get to understand why Edgar falls for Carter so fast — but it’s a breezy and snarky comedy. The book also touches on some deep subjects including class separation the burdens of royalty and homophobia.

Can this relationship endure? We root for the two men to find their happily ever after.

Beth & Amy Virginia Kantra (Berkley $16).

In this sequel to Meg & Jo about the older two March sisters Virginia Kantra focuses on the two younger ones from Louisa May Alcott’s Little Women.

Beth has reached adulthood and is a talented singer and songwriter. Amy is a designer of handbags and her New York business Baggage is taking off.

Amy has been in love with Theodore James Laurence III the rich boy next door since she was a child. Trey of course had always been in love with Jo. But three years ago when she ran into Trey in Paris after he and Jo had broken up Amy and Trey shared one passionate night.

Now Jo is getting married to her love chef and restaurateur Eric Bhaer and everyone is coming back to North Carolina where Amy is sure to run into Trey again.

Beth has been touring with country star Colt Henderson for whom she wrote a couple hit songs. The two are now a couple though the self-absorbed singer does not notice that Beth dislikes the spotlight. In fact she has been throwing up. Colt suggests she go home for Jo’s wedding and then take time off and rest up.

Kantra’s books are a delight for readers who grew up with Little Women as she reimagines modern romances for the sisters whose love for each other abides.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vaGlnaHN0YWtlc2RiLmNvbS9uZXdzL2hpZ2gtc3Rha2VzLXJlcG9ydHMvbWF0dC1iZXJrZXktbG9zZXMtYWZ0ZXItZGlzYXBwb2ludGluZy1ydW4tb24tcG9rZXItYWZ0ZXItZGFya9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Matt Berkey Loses after Disappointing Run on Poker A...,"Image courtesy of PokerGO.com



The American-born player also known by his screen name “berkey11” saw his chips plummet from a peak of $10k down to a disappointing $5k on a recent Poker After Dark episode.



On this occasion the poker stars were playing a $50/$100 ($100 Ante) No-Limit Hold'em Cash Game with a $10000 Buy-In (1 Rebuy Permitted).



Matt Berkey was joined by the hugely accomplished Sam Soverel multi-millionaire James Romero PokerGO Tour champion Jake Daniels and high-stakes poker’s mysterious woman of the hour Lynne Ji- who was quite vocal about her intentions to go head-to-head with Berkey at the start of the episode.



Despite starting off the episode 5 grand in the hole Berkey established himself well at the beginning of the game. With $3k in his pile he would draw a king and an ace not suited. Ever the gambling type Lynne Ji made a hasty raise holding a 6 and 8 suited- but with no cards on the table showing her any love Berkeley snap calls to bag himself whopping $5.5k.



At this stage Berkey is looking good and some questionable possibly even slightly emotional plays from Ji make the Pennsylvanian appear the more composed player of the two.



Soon however things started to break down slightly for Berkey. James Romero would edge out Berkleys 10 and jack with a king and jack of his own- winning him a $6500 pot. This would be the first of a slew of folds and misses that would leave the 8-time WSOP cash finisher in a similar position to the one in which he started.



Wilting under the pressure of $13.2 million live earner Sam Soverel’s bluff Berkey concedes a cool $2k to a considerably weaker hand. Shortly after this a pair of 9s would snag him another couple of Gs from his vocal rival Ji- however the cracks in his game already seemed to be showing.



The rest of the evening proved relatively uneventful and unprosperous for Berkey- already $3k down he makes a series of folds that push him deeper into the red. Ji stood to be considerably more successful her stack totaling around $16k after winning a sizable pot against Jake Daniels.



Despite this unfortunate blip against Ji Daniels undoubtedly finished the game looking like “top dog” when he devastatingly and expertly bet the highly respected Soverel out of contention- calmly proclaiming aloud the high queen hand with which he dismantled his opponent.

The game left some fans feeling disappointed- due to some of the player’s apparently safe approaches in the episode. Some fans also questioned the witts of Ji who seemed to make some exceptionally risky plays during the game- and so it seems there is really no pleasing people.



If you play things cautiously your critics will say you play too boring- if you take a big risk and roll the dice then they will question your risk assessment capabilities. It is for this reason we can only use our own best judgment in poker- after all the best move is the one your enemy least wants you to make.



As for Berkley there is always the chance he can turn things around in future episodes.

Pittsburgh-based Wabtec Corp.; Carnegie Mellon University known for its engineering curriculum; and shortline and regional railroad operator Genesee & Wyoming announced Friday Sept. 10 that they have signed a memorandum of understanding to work to create a more sustainable rail freight network.

The parties will work on two fronts — developing locomotive fleets using alternative energy sources such as batteries and hydrogen fuel cells and advancing current signaling and digital technologies to increase rail capacity and safety.

Elected officials and other speakers hailed the effort as a first step toward “decarbonizing rail freight transport.” U.S. Senator Robert P. Casey Jr. (D-Pa.) noted Pennsylvania’s longstanding transportation leadership role from the Main Line of Public Works canal-and-rail system of the 1830s to the consummate railroad town Altoona Pa. which once employed 16000 workers in the Pennsylvania Railroad shops complex there.

“Today’s announcement will place Pittsburgh at the center of efforts to address climate change through transportation policy” Casey said “and will also spur significant job growth reduce greenhouse gas emissions and allow the U.S. to lead internationally in creating zero-emission solutions for rail.”

In May Casey introduced a bill S.1732 which would allocate $600 million for a Freight Rail Innovation Institute to research and develop alternative-power locomotives. U.S. Rep Conor Lamb (D-Pa.) who also spoke Friday was a co-sponsor of the house version of the bill [see “Digest: Industrial development firm launches rail affiliate …” Trains News Wire May 26 2021]. The agreement announced Friday will see Wabtec Carnegie Mellon and G&W formally join efforts in a partnership to pursue creation of that institute.

G&W which owns 116 freight carriers in North America the United Kingdom and Europe will provide a place to test technologies developed by the group on its Buffalo & Pittsburgh Railroad.

G&W president and CEO Jack Hellmann told Trains News Wire that Buffalo & Pittsburgh is ideal testing territory for new technology having rugged grades operating 130-car manifest consists and experiencing extreme weather contrasts along its approximately 220-mile mainline run between New Castle Pa. near Pittsburgh and Buffalo N.Y. “We’re the incubator we’re the testing ground for these new technologies” he said. G&W anticipates operating a battery-powered and hydrogen-powered set in revenue service on the B&P within three years

Joe Parsons president and CEO of Iowa Interstate Railroad was in attendance and said his railroad would be interested in exploring battery-powered technology. A preliminary step he said would be for Iowa Interstate to upload event-recorder data to Wabtec to provide information on grades fuel burn and other indices that are specific to that railroad’s operating profile. Iowa Interstate Chairman Henry Posner III serves on the CMU faculty.

FLXdrive details and plans for its successor

As part of the announcement Wabtec displayed its initial effort in alternative-energy locomotives the six-axle FLXdrive battery-electric locomotive developed in cooperation with BNSF Railway. The locomotive completed 13000 miles of testing in California earlier this year [see “Wabtec BNSF conclude initial tests of battery-electric locomotive” News Wire April 30 2021].

The locomotive labeled GECX 3000 is the result of several years of testing and development and was built at Wabtec’s former GE Transportation plant in Erie Pa. Wabtec acquired GE’s locomotive business in 2019.

From the front the bright red locomotive resembles other GE road power but the resemblance stops about 15 feet behind the cab where the carbody flares out to full width to accommodate 500 lithium-ion battery modules comprising 18000 individual cells. An interior walkway down the centerline of the battery compartment provides crew access from the cab to the rear platform and steps. Air is constantly circulated to cool the batteries according to Wabtec controls engineer John Dick who added that a large HVAC unit mounted above the battery section is designed to keep the interior at a steady 74 degrees Fahrenheit year-round.

Like a typical GE diesel-electric Tier 4 ES44 road freight model the FLXdrive is rated at 4400 horsepower but it can generate sustained maximum power for only 30 to 40 minutes according to Bruce Bloomster a Wabtec commercial project manager. Its electricity output is 2.4 megawatt-hours he said but Wabtec is designing a next-generation model that will be capable of generating 7 megawatt-hours with the increase attributable to improvements in battery technology. The next prototype is due in 2023.

From December 2020 to March 2021 GECX 3000 operated in revenue manifest-freight service on BNSF Railway between Stockton and Barstow Calif. a run of about 370 miles. Although the engine’s cab is equipped with a control stand the prototype is designed to operate in trailing configuration only so it typically worked with BNSF diesel units fore and aft.

Wabtec’s former-GE Trip Optimizer technology employed on diesel locomotives to serve as a kind of cruise control was modified to allow the distribution of power loading among units operating in multiple-unit configuration drawing on battery power first then diesel power. To an engineer the transition would be invisible. Another aspect of the crew cab environment is that the unit is much quieter than a conventional diesel locomotive.

Between trips the unit is plugged into a 480-volt supply that takes eight hours to recharge. Engineers say the next iteration of the unit will reduce that to four hours and the method of recharging may eventually be changed to a pantograph on the carbody roof.

In place of the fuel tank are two frame-mounted electrical cabinets. The front section handles charging while the rear section is devoted to managing low-power auxiliary electricity that is everything not needed for propulsion.

The unit rides on a C4 configuration having four powered axles per truck. Two center idler axles on each truck function as they do on a diesel unit distributing the weight dynamically for maximum traction. The FLXdrive unit uses regenerative (dynamic) braking to recharge the batteries.

Using a yard track of the former Monongahela Connecting railroad (now operated by Allegheny Valley Railroad) the event was staged at CMU’s Entertainment Technology Center campus along the east bank of the Monongahela River with the Pittsburgh skyline rising behind. Speakers in addition to Casey Lamb and Hellmann included Wabtec President and CEO Rafael Santana and William H. Sanders dean of CMU’s College of Engineering.",,,,,,,,,,,,

I then saved the photos in the JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) file format the stores wanted but I was told that some JPEG photos also aren't accepted. What can I do?

THOMAS ELWOOD Bedford N.H.

A: The photo printing services of Walmart and Walgreens require you to send them photos in the JPEG (also written as JPG) file format which is widely used by digital cameras. The main restrictions are that Walmart won't accept any photo larger than 16 megabytes (see tinyurl.com/4ne5w4ha) and Walgreens discourages sending a photo larger than 20 megabytes (see tinyurl.com/pez3kt25). These limitations probably won't affect you; iPhone JPEG photos typically contain less than 10 megabytes of data.

The HEIC photo format (Apple's version of the standard HEIF or High Efficiency Image Format) was designed to save storage space on iPhones. HEIC photos require only about one-third as much storage space as JPEG photos. The drawback to HEIC is that some photo-printing services and non-Apple devices don't use that format. So since 2017 Apple has let you choose which format your iPhone should use for photos. To pick one go to Settings click on camera then click Formats. Choose ""high efficiency"" for HEIC or ""most compatible"" for JPEG.

If you've already taken a lot of photos using HEIC there are plenty of programs that can convert them to JPEG (see tinyurl.com/f3tkzd or tinyurl.com/373buv84). In addition online file storage services such as Dropbox and Microsoft OneDrive can convert your HEIC photos to JPEG format when you upload the pictures from your iPhone.

Q: Until now whenever I used my wireless mouse with my HP laptop the PC's touchpad became inactive. But now the touchpad will not turn off and this PC doesn't seem to have an enable-disable control for it. I've tried all the suggestions I could find online but nothing works. What can I do?

PATRICIA TRAPP Glastonbury Conn.

A: It is possible to disconnect the touchpad. But first you need to make sure that your mouse is working properly. Otherwise you could wind up with no way to access your PC.

Try reconnecting the wireless mouse to your PC to make sure it's set up correctly (you can search Google for step-by-step directions for your mouse's brand and model.) If for some reason the mouse won't connect check to see if the mouse itself has been ""disabled"" on your PC.

To do that use the touchpad to open Control Panel and click on ""device manager."" You'll get a list of all the devices on your PC. Scroll down to ""mice and other pointing devices"" and click on it. You should see two devices listed: Your mouse and something called ""input device"" which is your touchpad. Click on the mouse and at the top of the resulting menu click the ""driver"" tab. Make sure that the mouse is ""enabled"" (if you're given a choice to disable the mouse then it is enabled.) If the mouse still doesn't connect properly there's something wrong with it.

Once you know the mouse is working properly go back to device manager click on ""mice and other pointing devices"" and this time click on ""input device."" At the top of the resulting menu click the ""driver"" tab. Click on ""disable device"" then click OK.

Marie worked at Walmart in Naples Florida back in 2010 a job that she held for five years. Her supervisors reportedly described her as a responsible and reliable person a sentiment held by many who knew the 34-year-old mother of four.

A Husband Tells Police His Version Of Events

The last time anyone saw Marie Delly a Haitian immigrant who had lived in the United States since 1984 was on May 17 2010 when she left her job after clocking out of work. Her husband Mathnald Dareus would later tell authorities that he dropped Marie off at work at 8:30 that morning but he did not know who picked her up. Walmart surveillance cameras reportedly captured Marie leaving the store but they did not show outside so it could not be determined who if anyone came to get her. Marie reportedly did not have a driver’s license. Her husband reported her missing two days later.

The marriage between Marie and Dareus was said to be a volatile one. It is reported that she spoke of being physically abused by her husband and her family told authorities that their arguments were frequent. The weekend before Marie went missing she and Dareus allegedly got into one of their fights but he reportedly denied the accusations of violence.

Marie’s Son Says Her Husband Abandoned The Family

According to Marie’s son Lavanda Warren Dareus abandoned Marie’s children not long after she went missing.

“He just left. He moved to Orlando and we never heard from him again” said Lavanda. Now a young man Lavanda was 14 years old when his mother went missing. He went on to become a wrestling and football star at Golden Gates High School in Naples and later he competed on the wrestling team at Florida A&M University in Tallahassee where he majored in criminal justice.

Marie Warned Her Son About Potential Danger

Lavanda claimed that his mother shared an ominous message with him before she disappeared.

Manthald Dareus

“My mom told me ‘Lavanda if I ever die just know that Ken Ken killed me'” he said years ago while using Dareus’s nickname. At the time Lavanda also held out hope that his mother would one day return home alive despite people telling him the odds were very few. “It’s been too long just wondering you know? When’s the answer going to come in? We need to know.”

Although Marie had previously on two occasions left town without alerting Dareus her family insists that she was a dedicated mother who would never up and leave her children. Since she vanished there has not been any movement on Marie’s bank accounts. Dareus remains a person of interest in this case.

The Husband Takes A Polygraph Test

According to reports Dareus underwent a four-question polygraph test and failed two of the questions. His accounts of his activities when his wife went missing were also said to have been contradictory—he told authorities that he dropped her off at work but later stated that she did not go to work that day. Surveillance footage shows a car similar to his in the Walmart parking lot on the afternoon his wife went missing and later a highway toll booth captured his vehicle making its way to Miami. His phone records reportedly showed that he was in Miami for a short time.

Mathnald Dareus Arrested For Murder—But Not In Marie’s Case

In October 2015 this case took a turn when Dareus was arrested on murder charges. It was then that a man visited a Hyatt Regency in Orlando shot and killed 49-year-old Cedilien Forestal in his car on the fifth floor of the hotel’s parking lot and drove off in a red vehicle after pointing a gun at and threatening Michael Biagioni a hotel employee.

Police later found Dareus sitting in a vehicle with a gun and blood on his hands. He also reportedly tested positive for gunshot residue.

“Come on. You’re going to do life for murder” said Lavanda in 2017 adding that his family always suspected Dareus was involved in his mother’s disappearance. “Now’s the time. If you know something say something. We need to know.”

“There isn’t any closure” Marie’s sister Bobbi Lene said years ago. “She’s missing and you can’t really cope.”

Marie Delly: What To Know

At the time of her disappearance Marie Delly stood 5 feet 9 inches tall to 5 feet 10 inches tall and weighed 210 to 220 pounds. She had black/dark brown hair and brown eyes. She has two tattoos: the name “Tyrese” on her right shoulder and the “Manthnald” on her left shoulder. Marie was prescribed diabetes medication but it is unclear if she had it with her. She was last seen wearing a dark blue polo shirt and khaki pants. She may go by her middle name “Chantal.”

S . e c o n o my Walmart Inc. and other grocery retailers continue to face shortages of everyday items as the pandemic-hit supply chain struggles to recover.

From big-box stores to small grocery chains sellers of food consumables and general merchandise are finding it hard to offer customers the full selection of products and name brands they’re accustomed to buying.

The problem doesn’t lie with just one particular point on the supply chain such as manufacturing sourcing or imports industry experts say. Instead every single point along the supply chain is stressed with a ripple effect that culminates in stores where shoppers can’t find their favorite brand of peanut butter soft drinks or cat food.

Unlike the panic-induced buying seen early in the pandemic shoppers’ buying patterns have remained steady — though heightened — since March 2020 according to a spokeswoman with FMI the food industry association formerly known as the Food Marketing Institute.

“From a big-picture perspective the current challenges are due to a confluence of supply chain factors” FMI spokeswoman Heather Garlich said. These include materials and ingredients; labor; equipment; transportation and trucking; capacity; inventory control; cost pressures; and weather-related events she said.

But of all these challenges it’s the national labor shortage that’s put the kinks in the supply chain said Doug Baker FMI’s vice president of industry relations.

As an example Baker said “You’re in the trucking industry and you need to get parts for trucks but they can’t get the part because it’s on a ship in a port and there’s not enough labor to unload the ship. It’s a ripple effect and it backs up everything down the line.” “And this will go on until the labor shortage is fixed” Baker said. “We’ve got to get our businesses fully employed again.” Although Walmart didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment about its out-of-stock items and brands company executives have repeatedly addressed the issue in interviews and presentations over the past year.

Walmart Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs told investors last month that “out-of-stocks in certain general merchandise categories are running above normal given strong sales and supply constraints.” “We continue to monitor industry trends related to transit and port delays” Biggs said. “Our merchants continue to take steps to mitigate challenges including adding extra lead time to orders and chartering vessels specifically for Walmart goods.” John Furner chief executive officer of Walmart U.S. on the same conference call praised the company’s supply chain team for its management of the disruptions in the global supply chain. Walmart has secured resources for transporting goods in the third and fourth quarters he said.

“We feel good about the inventory positioning particularly compared to last year with inventory up 20% across the segment” Furner said.

Walmart’s U.S. supply chain teams “have done a number of things to ensure that flow is strong” Furner said. “That would include everything from offshore to onshore properties like our distribution network and in particular our food distribution team has done an amazing job keeping products moving.” Kathryn McLay chief executive officer of Walmart’s Sam’s Club division said in a recent video interview with Yahoo Finance (watch it here: arkansasonline.com/samsceo) that she’s confident Sam’s Club will have inventory on hand for consumers especially going into the Christmas holiday shopping season.

“We have been working through supply chain challenges it feels like for the past 18 months and it has certainly gotten better” McLay said. “We’ve had to work to pull forward inventory and to make sure that we are prioritizing that the right freight gets here on time.” At the same time McLay said Sam’s Club is working with its suppliers to keep prices low for members.

Another big-box retailer members-only warehouse chain Costco has gone so far as to place purchase limits on certain products — a strategy seen often in the early months of the pandemic when shoppers’ panic-buying and stockpiling of supplies emptied store shelves.

A recent update to Cost-co’s covid-19 policy posted on its website states simply “Some warehouses may have temporary item limits on select items.” The company is staying mum about the policy change but Costco’s online ordering site limits the purchase quantities of some paper goods. For instance a 12-roll pack of Bounty paper towels was limited to one per customer on Thursday.

Smaller grocery chains are feeling the pinch as much as the big-box stores said Steve Edwards special projects manager for GES Inc. which operates eight Edwards Food Giant stores and five Edwards Cash Saver stores.

The pandemic “really spotlighted how fragile our supply chain is” Edwards said and the problem is mainly labor issues.

“It’s not a food shortage or shortage of raw materials” Edwards said. “It’s a matter of getting product into stores.” And the products or brands out of stock are constantly changing he said. “It’s kind of like a game of Whac-A-Mole.” Edwards attributes the labor shortage largely to the pandemic.

“Obviously [covid-19] gets thrown in there” Edwards said. The company’s main warehouse in Southaven Miss. which is already short-staffed had about 30 or 40 workers out a couple of weeks ago because of the virus he said.

“It’s pushing down on an already constrained labor market” Edwards said. “And I think when you throw in the fact that we’re having issues with labor at the store level and then our warehouse is having issues at the warehouse level the trucking company’s having issues — you take a little piece out of every step in the process and you start to see the large impact that it has.” As for when supply chain issues may be resolved Baker said he’s hearing maybe 2022 or 2023. “This will go on until the labor shortage is fixed” he said.

Edwards also said product will begin to flow more smoothly once the labor shortage eases.

“I think it’s one of those things that’s just going to happen naturally” he said.

Amazon Kroger and Walmart will be selling over-the-counter tests ""at cost"" a discount of up to 35% from retail prices over the next three months the Biden administration says.

Private companies that sell direct-to-consumer tests are scrambling to again ramp up production of rapid tests.

Consumers could soon get discounted coronavirus tests at Amazon Kroger and Walmart as part of President Joe Biden's plan to significantly increase testing.

The Biden administration said those three major retailers over the next three months will sell rapid over-the-counter tests ""at cost"" a discount of up to 35% from retail prices.

Biden's strategy calls for spending nearly $2 billion to procure 280 million rapid tests for long-term care facilities community testing sites homeless shelters prisons and other vulnerable populations. Another 25 million free at-home rapid tests would be sent to community health centers and food banks.

Companies say federal support to expand testing options is needed as the delta variant drives demand higher and manufacturers scramble to keep pace.

""There is a big shortage in the market right now across the board"" said Ron Gutman co-CEO of Intrivo a testing manufacturer. ""We have a lot more demand than we’ve ever seen before.""

Intrivio is the technology and business partner of Access Bio one of six companies with Food and Drug Administration authorization to sell home tests directly to consumers. Rapid antigen tests made by Abbott Laboratories Quidel and Ellume have been sold for months by major retailers ranging in price from about $12 to $40 a test. Intrivio/Access Bio expect to begin selling retail rapid tests in the coming weeks.

What we know:Who's covered by Biden's new vaccine mandates? When do they go into effect?

Private companies that sell direct-to-consumer tests are scrambling to again ramp up production of rapid tests.

In June Abbott which makes versions of the Abbott BinaxNow rapid antigen test warned investors of ""significantly lower"" demand for tests and closed a factory in Gurnee Illinois that manufactured the tests a move that eliminated 2000 jobs. More recently Abbott said it was again working to produce more tests. The kits have been available periodically at major retail stores.

Ellume CEO Sean Parsons said the company is moving to 24-hour production to churn out tests at the company's manufacturing site in Australia. The company which secured a $231.8 million Defense Department deal to expand U.S. production plans to open a factory in Maryland by the end of the year.

""We’re certainly looking to increase production as swiftly as we safely can"" Parsons said.

Along with vaccination and wearing masks testing remains an important tool to contain the spread of coronavirus said Marcus Plescia chief medical officer of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.

Plescia said states are once again adding testing options for residents after steering limited resources to vaccination this year.

Is Biden's COVID-19 vaccine mandate a law? What happens to those who don't get the shot?

Rapid home tests are popular with consumers and make it easier to check their status but Plescia said the tests also are more difficult to track because results are often not reported to state and local public health departments.

""If you do test positive you’ve got to do the right thing: stay at home limit your interactions with other people and if you’ve been around other people let them know"" Plescia said. ""The public health departments will do that for you but only if we know you have tested positive.""

Others worry that even with Biden's pledge to expand testing cost will remain a barrier for some. While health insurance companies are required to cover the cost of laboratory-based tests and some rapid antigen tests consumers might not be reimbursed when they buy tests directly from retailers.

""The tests in the United States are more expensive – that does lead to barriers in testing"" said Dr. Julie Swann a North Carolina State professor and health systems expert.

Swann cited Great Britain's routine screening of children as the example of national testing program that has ""had a huge impact on reducing transmission.""

The Biden plan probably will require a wide variety of tests not just rapid tests consumers can purchase at retail stores. The federal Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration will develop a rule requiring businesses with 100 or more employees to mandate vaccinations or require weekly testing.

Many employers already require workers to be tested regularly before entering an office or a manufacturing site and the increased testing has testing manufacturers scrambling to meet demand.

""We are literally working around the clock to increase capacity"" Gutman said. ""We feel there is an urgency around getting more tests to market.""

This one will be different.

The morning of Sept. 11 2001 started uneventfully at Walt Disney World. At 8:46 a.m. when the first jet slammed into the World Trade Center guests were already inside the Magic Kingdom and were starting to funnel into the other three theme parks. For the first few minutes the crash in New York appeared to be an accident a naïve notion dispelled the instant the second jet hit at 9:03 a.m. America was under attack.

Not long after word funneled in about the crash into the Pentagon and Flight 93′s downing in Pennsylvania as passengers fought back. Earlier this week News 6 Investigates’ Merris Badcock beautifully told the story of why Flight 93′s terrorists were short-handed thanks to a true hero working at Orlando International Airport.

Disneyland and its brand new sister park “California Adventure” never opened that day. In the chaos of that morning Disney executives were facing the unknown and even before the FAA ruled all planes must land and the airspace cleared coast to coast they announced on ABC all Disney parks worldwide would close.

Less than five minutes later that word filtered up to area and attraction leads security and all other cast members. For the first time in memory in Florida a parks-wide announcement abruptly broke through the area music that helps cast a spell each day: “Ladies and gentlemen due to circumstances beyond our control Walt Disney World is now closed. Please follow the instructions of cast members and move to the nearest exit.” It was only the second time a national emergency shut down Disney parks. The first was the assassination of John F. Kennedy in 1963 long before Walt had even started scouting land in Central Florida.

How unprecedented was the closure? For its first 28 years Walt Disney World never closed its gates for a full day though the Magic Kingdom and Epcot did close several hours early for Hurricane Elena on Aug. 31 1985. Hurricane Floyd closed the theme parks and water parks early on Sept. 14 1999. Sept. 11 2001 was only the third such event.

Still when the emergency was declared detailed procedures were in place to clear the parks. Cast members were told to form “human walls” to link hands and systematically sweep and empty parks full of guests all at once. Most guests were not told why.

My dear friends Steve and Beth Shorten were on vacation from New Jersey that fateful day staying at the Wilderness Lodge for their fifth wedding anniversary. In a 2013 remembrance on her blog Beth wrote in part: “I had managed to secure us a spot as the ‘Flag Family’ ... so on September 11th we were up early. We needed to be in the lobby and ready to go by 7:30.” A cast member took them up some stairs to the roof of the resort. Beth adds: “The view was incredible. It was a beautiful morning. Steve was the one who raised the first flag the American Flag. We then raised the state flag the WDW park flag and the two flags that were for the hotel. I snapped as many photos as I could.”

They were in the Magic Kingdom’s Liberty Square when the park was closed somewhat aware of the plane crashes but not the implications of what was to come. That came when a parkwide announcement called on cast members to carry out “Emergency Plan A.” Beth added “There were cast members lining the streets and some of them were not in ‘costume’ but must have been from the corporate office as they were wearing suits (something you don’t see on Main Street USA). We took a boat back to our hotel. It was a long process but orderly. With all the parks shut down for the day... we spent the day at our hotel. We watched the news in disbelief as the rest of the nation did It is understandable that I don’t recall much else of our vacation.”

Of the evacuation itself a Frontierland cast member named Michael told The HuffPost back in 2011: ”We were told not to tell the guests what had happened unless they asked us. I remember one guest asking me and — after I told them — they just stood there blank faced and didn’t move for a bit.”

Disney and its cast members (not to mention SeaWorld and Universal) should be commended for how they handled that day and what came next. To help keep children occupied and not terrorized Mickey Donald Tigger and the rest were scrambled out to all of the resort hotels. Front desk and reservations cast members patiently found ways to extend stays of guests who with no flights had nowhere else to go. Resort restaurants all had to ramp up on a dime to cope with huge crowds at meal times when most guests typically eat out in the theme parks.

I have heard over and over from both guests staying and cast members working on those days praising how well Disney made the most of a truly horrific situation.

Sept. 12 2001 the parks reopened but the world and Disney World had changed forever. Overnight makeshift bag screening tables were set up outside each theme park (this also was the case at SeaWorld and Universal). These initial days of screenings were much longer slower and more thorough than what guests encounter today. Many people were asked to remove batteries from electronics to verify they were what they appeared to be. These early checks were supervised by Orange County Sheriff’s deputies who also appeared in uniform outside and inside the parks. That was all but unheard of just the day before.

Disney and all Florida theme parks have had to adapt to the very real possibility of being potential terror targets something reinforced immensely by details of the Pulse nightclub mass shooting. Bag checks are just the tip of the iceberg of how intense the focus on safety and security has become. In addition to much larger staff added K-9 patrols bomb-sniffing dogs and the like Disney installed gates capable of withstanding vehicle rammings at backstage entrances.

With the help of federal authorities a no-fly zone was established over its parks. To this day restrictions are especially tight over and near the Magic Kingdom even for our own Sky 6 news helicopter.

As the years (and now decades) have passed Disney and the others have managed to make so much of the security measures more seamless and easy and guests have grown more used to them which helped immensely when temperature screenings were added in 2020 for reopenings amid the COVID-19 pandemic. In the past year Disney has rolled out extremely high-tech scanners at its parks and Disney Springs that make most manual bag checks obsolete. You can read much more about the security changes and challenges in an excellent article posted on ClickOrlando.com.

At Magic Kingdom on Saturday scant attention was overtly paid to the 20th anniversary of the attacks unless you knew where and when to look.

The Flag Retreat Ceremony has been held daily since 1971 in the Magic Kingdom and honors a veteran of the day. (Disney)

Where: The U.S. flag pole in Town Square of Main Street USA. When: At 5 p.m. on Saturday and every day the Flag Retreat Ceremony honors a veteran naming them Disney Magic Makers. For Sept. 11 2021 Disney chose Rob Vickers of Gulf Breeze Florida. Vickers first served our nation in the U.S. Marines. After the Sept. 11 attacks he rejoined active duty as a military police officer in the U.S. Air Force until a medical discharge in 2010.

Rob Vickers of Gulf Breeze Florida was serving in the Army National Guard on September 11th 2001 and was a first responder at Ground Zero. Prior he served in the U.S. Marine Corps and after served in the U.S. Air Force retiring after a total of 14 years of military service. (Disney)

A third-generation veteran after that retirement Vickers and a friend started Emerald Coast Wounded Warriors advocating for and assisting wounded veterans and their families. Many of the warriors Vickers champions for have received free homes service dogs emergency mental health care financial aid and spaces to safely interact with one another – a critical need for veterans living in isolation during the pandemic.

Rob Vickers of Gulf Breeze Florida was the veteran of the day on September 11th 2021 for the Flag Retreat Ceremony at The Magic Kingdom. He served our nation for 14 years in the Marines Air Force and US Army National Reserve. (Disney)

He is especially pleased when he can help fellow 9/11 first responders. You see Vickers had joined The Army National Guard in 2000 and happened to be in New York City traveling with a church group in September 2001. He has pictures from the top of the World Trade Center’s South Tower taken Sept. 8. On Sept. 12 he arrived at Ground Zero and spent 28 days there telling the Pensacola News Journal he experienced the best and worst of humanity.

Before Saturday’s ceremony Vickers told the Disney Parks Blog that “helping others is very therapeutic for me”

I highly recommend taking the time to witness the Flag Retreat. It’s a patriotic Disney tradition dating back all 50 years in Florida and much earlier in California.

In a 2017 Disney Parks YouTube video a Disney security guard described it as “kind of a 30 minute window of Veterans Day on a daily basis I go out and my goal is to find one person and make a difference to that one person to have that unforgettable moment. The flag ceremony is about the veteran each day so that they have the acknowledgement from us. We just want to show our appreciation. We do recognize the sacrifices you made. We do respect the sacrifice made. (We) select the veteran of the day take down the flag folded up and then the veteran would then carry it off the street. We just get to spend a 30 minute window with somebody who has served in the military.... We want to make sure that that individual on that particular day has the best experience they can possibly.”

The Flag Retreat Ceremony has been held daily since 1971 in the Magic Kingdom and honors a veteran of the day. (Disney)

If we look every day we can see how Sept. 11 has changed the nation tourism and Walt Disney World forever. Of those millions of lives I can’t help but wonder about two: a bride and groom.

On Sept. 11 2017 Beth Shorten recalled as she and her husband were making their way down from the roof of The Wilderness Lodge: “I noticed a small area I believe on the 4th floor that was obviously going to be used for a small wedding ceremony and/or reception... I never saw any members of the wedding party but it was such a picture perfect day and it was Disney so I was sure it would be a beautiful and memorable wedding.” Beth adds that as the day unfolded “The thoughts of an impending wedding faded from my mind. But I remember it every year even as my own anniversary is just days away. I wonder about the bride and groom. I wonder what their wedding day was really like.”

45 Release Window Is Here To Stay

Some people have been… well let’s just say irked by Disney+’s Premier Access. Sure it was convenient for people who didn’t feel comfortable yet going back to the movies but we can’t deny the sort of problems its caused in Hollywood. Thankfully all of Walt Disney Studios’ movies will have a limited 45 release window in theaters before hitting Disney+! Marvel Studios Eternals (Nov.5) falls under that category. However Disney’s 60th animated feature Encanto will only be in theaters for 30 days before it hits the service on Christmas Eve. The movie releases on Thanksgiving weekend.

The same will be applied for 20th Century Studios! Free Guy is still showing to have strong legs in the box office but don’t expect to see The Last Duel (Oct.15th) Ron’s Gone Wrong (Oct.22nd) Steven Spielberg’s West Side Story (Dec.10) or The King’s Man (Dec.22nd) on Disney+ any time soon.

And this year as her cheeky teen comedy The Parent Trap turns 60 she’s talking about what it meant to be a young Disney icon — and what it was like to personally know Walt Disney.

Hayley Mills earned a $17 million dollar fortune by the time she was 21

Mills happens to have been one of the most popular young actors of the 1960s. Between a Juvenile Academy Award for her heart-rending turn as Pollyanna in 1960 and her dual roles as identical twins Susan Evers and Sharon McKendrick in 1961s The Parent Trap she defined herself as the ultimate wholesome Disney icon.

She was so successful in her youth that she earned (and subsequently lost) the equivalent of a $17 million fortune in Disney movies by the time she reached adulthood.

At the time that kind of success could only have come from a genuine approval by the man himself – Walt Disney whom Hayley Mills says cared about her well-being both on set and off.

She recently said that Walt Disney was ‘intimately involved’ with his movies

In an interview with Vulture in August 2021 to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the original Parent Trap Mills revealed that Walt Disney often visited the sets of movies she was working on.



“Yes he often did (come by the set)” Mills told Vulture. “He would just come down from his office and wander across the lot. And he’d go and visit all the sets and the soundstages. See everybody.”

The actor added that Disney had a very personal investment in each of his movies and that he was always involved with the productions and the actors. Among her most important observations of the legendary auteur was his encouragement.

​​“He loved movies he loved actors” said Mills. “He loved the whole process of moviemaking. And he was intricately involved with every shot — every aspect of the movie. He knew what was going on. And he was always really encouraging.”

She had loyalty and respect for the man who ultimately made her a global star calling Disney a “lovely friendly warm sweet genuine human being.”

Hayley Mills said she was never exploited as a child actor

Mills’ new memoir Forever Young was released in September 2021. In it she went into even more detail about losing her fortune to high taxes filming her movies as a teen and what it was like to work closely alongside Walt Disney.

He was protective enough of her image and her doings she told The Los Angeles Times in a September interview that he became a “father figure.”

“He was a father figure and fathers do that — say ‘No you can’t go to this dance. You can’t go on a motorbike with that boy’” she told the LA Times. “That’s life. I was extremely fortunate to be under contract to a studio like that. To a man like that. I was not exploited in the way that we understand that word.”

Mills created a post-Disney adult career for herself but her most memorable roles will always be as that smiling girl with a mischievous streak. Truly happy child stars can be difficult to come by; thanks to Walt Disney himself Hayley Mills evidently really was one.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNici5jb20vc25vdy13aGl0ZS1zZXZlbi1kcmF3ZnMtYWN0dWFsLW1ha2V1cC1jaGVla3MtZmlsbS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Did Disney Animators Use Actual Makeup on Snow White's Cheeks in the Film?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNici5jb20vc25vdy13aGl0ZS1zZXZlbi1kcmF3ZnMtYWN0dWFsLW1ha2V1cC1jaGVla3MtZmlsbS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Do they acknowledge the occasion and invite accusations of being opportunistic? Do they stay silent and risk appearing out of touch or unpatriotic? What is the border between commemoration and commercialization?

On Saturday during a break in an afternoon football game Budweiser will mark the 20th anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks with a commercial showing a team of Clydesdale horses pulling a red Budweiser-branded wagon across the Brooklyn Bridge and down a cobblestone street of Lower Manhattan. In the final image the horses standing on the grass of Liberty State Park in Jersey City N.J. lower their heads before the city skyline where the Tribute in Light installation is visible against the twilight sky.

The 60-second commercial which appeared on YouTube on Friday is an updated version of Budweiser’s “Respect” ad which first ran during the 2002 Super Bowl five months after the attacks. The company released that commercial again on the 10th anniversary in 2011.

After nailing pole position with a track record time on Saturday Bagnaia led from the start tracked by Marquez who was hunting his 58th MotoGP win.

The pair soon pulled clear of the pack with Marquez launching multiple attacks over the closing laps.

On his last passing attempt the Spaniard who was born not far from the Motorland circuit went too wide on a turn allowing Bagnaia to take a hard-fought but deserved first MotoGP win.

“This victory today is like a release. We’ve worked hard to get this result” said Bagnaia.

Defending world champion Joan Mir came third.

With five rounds of the season to go Quartararo leads the race for the riders’ crown on 214 points with Bagnaia in second on 161 and Mir four points further adrift.

Bagnaia led from pole on his factory Ducati from Marquez and Australian Jack Miller on the other Ducati.

Quartararo who started on the front row had a poor start dropping back to seventh.

Marquez kept pace with Bagnaia with the front pair pulling over three seconds clear of the chasing pack now led by Mir as Miller slipped to fifth with a dozen laps to go in the Spanish sunshine.

This track has never been kind to Quartararo and the 22-year-old wasn’t about to buck that trend as he approached the closing laps in ninth place.

Marquez was edging ever closer to Bagnaia ready to pounce.

With three laps to go he tested the temperature going up the inside to briefly take the lead.

Lucifer fans have finally found out how the show of angels and demons ends and there was a lot to unpack in the recently-debuted sixth season of the drama.

One particularly satisfying element of the final season was LAPD forensic scientist Ella Lopez finally discovering the truth about the gang with a series of clues leading to her arriving at Maze (Lesley-Ann Brandt) and Eve (Inbar Lavi)'s wedding with the news that she has worked everything out about who they really are.

This revelation in episode seven of the final season is followed by a bottle episode directed by Amenadiel actor DB Woodside in which Ella finds out even more about her friends and shares her frustrations with them revealing just how betrayed she feels after being left out for so long.

Actress Aimee Garcia who plays Ella has revealed to TVLine that despite this moment seeming so important it could have played out very differently if the show hadn't been granted a sixth and final season by Netflix.

""I loved it"" she said of Ella's big moment. ""Ella is a problem-solver she has a curious detective's mind so I think it was such a beautiful setup of five seasons where in the sixth season she's solving the biggest case of her life which is the end of the world!

""It was the perfect way to find out. I like that no one told her because that made her feel very isolated from her Scooby Gang. It made her feel very alone and as a result she got to explore places as a character we've never seen before.

""It was the perfect way to distinguish her reaction from other characters'. Chloe had to escape and go to Italy and get answers and Dan spiralled into the depth of craziness so I think it was so fitting that Ella figured it out on her own and that not only was she not surprised she was more upset that they didn't tell her.

""That is so indicative of where her priorities lie that she was really upset that she was left out almost more so than the world is ending.""

Garcia and TVLine confirmed that the original plan for Ella's discovery was for it to be covered in a montage at the end of season five with Ella finding out the truth after seeing baby Charlie grow wings.

But Garcia is delighted that with the addition of season six fans were able to explore Ella's feelings about finding out the truth in a lot more depth.

""That's why I'm so excited that we got a sixth season because instead of every character's arc being wrapped up in a montage scene at the end of season 5 we got entire episodes"" she said.

The actress was also full of praise for her co-star Woodside for directing Ella's emotional discovery episode calling him an ""awesome"" director.

""I told him this but I think I did some of my best work as a professional actor under his tutelage and I am so proud of him"" she said describing how he had helped her while filming Ella's first ever sighting of an angel.

""What a payoff to see a character of faith see an angel for the first time and that was all DB's direction"" she said. ""So I just want to give a little love and shout out to him.""

China's first high-level radioactive liquid waste disposal equipment capable of melting waste into glass has been officially put into use in Guangyuan Southwest China's Sichuan Province on Saturday making China one of the few countries in the world to have acquired such a technique.Chinese experts believed that the technique could have been a better option for Japan to dispose the nuclear-contaminated Fukushima wastewater but Japan ""clearly does not want to pay the bill.""The equipment is a milestone project at the back end of the nuclear industry chain and is considered a major step forward in the safe and green development of China's nuclear industry the Global Times learned from the State Administration of Science Technology and Industry for National Defense on Sunday.

Nuclear waste treatment is the final part during the safe use of nuclear energy of which the most difficult and technically advanced is the treatment of high-level radioactive liquid.To tackle the challenge China's approach is to mix and melt liquid waste with glass materials at a temperature of 1100 C or higher and then leave it to cool and form into glass which can effectively and stably contain the radioactive elements inside thanks to the low leaching and high strength of the glass read a statement from the administration.Such an approach to deal with the waste is by far the most advanced method in the world the statement said. Only the US France Germany and a few others have mastered the technique previously.The difficulties and core capabilities of such a waste disposal mechanism lie in the consolidation formula with a high inclusive rate and stability to make sure the radioactive materials inside can be safely contained for more than 1000 years the statement said.

The project was approved by the China Atomic Energy Authority (CAEA) in 2004 and was designed jointly by China and Germany. The first batch of glass bodies consolidated from radioactive waste were rolled out for evaluation on August 27 and successfully passed the tests with all relevant technical indicators reaching international advanced levels.The annual waste disposal amount is expected to reach several hundred cubic meters and the glass produced from the waste will be buried in a repository hundred of meters beneath the ground realizing the complete isolation of radioactive materials with the biosphere and laying a solid foundation for the safe use of nuclear energy in the future.In April the Japanese government made a startling decision to dump nuclear-contaminated Fukushima wastewater into the ocean claiming the decision ""the best option"" a remark that shocked and drawn fury not only from its neighboring countries but also the whole world.

Zhou Yongmao an academician at the Chinese Academy of Engineering who spent over 60 years in nuclear engineering told the Global Times in a previous exclusive interview that leaving the nuclear wastewater deep underground after solidification is a relatively better option for safety and health concerns though with higher costs. However ""the Japanese government clearly does not want to pay the bill preferring to push the risk on to others.""""China has always attached great importance to radioactive waste management and it has maintained an open attitude for international cooperation"" the administration said. ""China as a responsible world nuclear power has strengthened collaboration with the International Atomic Energy Agency and actively participated in experience exchanges with others.""Now China has acquired waste treatment capabilities with high- medium- and low-level radioactivity. Liu Yongde chief engineer at CAEA said that the institute will accelerate the process of radioactive waste disposal to provide sound support for China's commitment to peak carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc3RlMzYwLmNvbS93YXN0ZS1yZWN5Y2xpbmcvaG90LW1hcmtldHMtY29tbW9kaXR5LXByaWNlcy1hbmQtcmVjeWNsZWQtY29udGVudC13aGF0LXMtbmV4dNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hot Markets Commodity Prices and Recycled Content: What's Next,"More than halfway through 2021 recyclables remain a hot commodity. Prices for paper and most plastic curbside recyclables are at or near all time highs. After three years of record-setting lows recyclers are enjoying this change.

Yet people keep asking me if these prices will last. The answer of course is no. Recyclables are commodities. Fluctuating prices are second nature to commodities. However barring the unexpected recycling markets should stay strong for a while. After all demand has swamped supply. Veteran scrap dealers like to say recyclables are bought not sold. Today’s markets reflect that experience. Buyers want more than what is available.

Prices for used corrugated boxes are a good example. These boxes known as “OCC” are primarily generated by large retail stores and other businesses that can be relied upon to supply significant quantities of high quality raw materials. Due to pandemic-induced business closures those supplies are down. Residentially generated OCC is up due to the rise of e-commerce. However you and I don’t do as well as businesses in providing high quantities of clean used boxes. As a result mills are scrambling to find supplies. Residential mixed paper prices are rising because it can be used as a supplemental raw material in making boxes. Growing export markets are also competing with domestic mills for supplies.

Rising recycled plastic prices are driven by a variety of factors. Higher oil prices are playing a role so be thankful the next time you buy gas. Those prices are good for recycling. Another factor is the slow recovery of Texas petrochemical plants from the impact of the weather freeze earlier this year. Colored HDPE and PP also benefit from the strong construction market. While the explosion in HDPE prices has slowed down and PP prices have gone down a tad they remain at record-setting levels.

The most important factor however is the recycled content goals made by consumer brands. Natural HDPE in particular is a very versatile material whose lack of color means it can be easily used to make non-food contact packages. This has spurred its record-shattering prices as brands work to increase their use of recycled content.

PET prices remain disappointing. Yes they continue to improve. But not close to the record-setting pace for other packaging resins even though beverage companies which are big users of PET have announced recycled content goals. Perhaps in this case those targets are not having the impact of the goals for non-food contact products. For years carpet clothing and other companies making products out of plastic fiber have been the biggest end market for PET bottles. Their end products are more valuable than bottles which puts beverage companies at a price disadvantage.

This raises an obvious question. Is recycled content a big priority for the beverage companies? Instead of goals for 2025 and 2030 what are their goals for each intervening year? Do those companies make increased recycled content a big enough priority that meeting them is part of the CEO’s compensation package? Do their raw material buyers get bonuses for increasing the amount of recycled PET they buy even if they pay more than they would for virgin PET resin? Just like teaching to the test compensation packages set the tone for what executives focus on. I hope using more recycled content is a part of those packages.

As I noted above high prices never last forever in commodity markets. What goes up sooner or later goes down and then back up again. That is the nature of recycling markets. Price swings are inevitable results of economic ups and downs. So

enjoy these markets. They should last for a while. But while you are enjoying them give some thought to how to prepare for the next down cycle. Being prepared is always a good strategy.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vZGFpbHl0YXJndW0uY29tL2FydGljbGUvMjAyMS8wOS90aHJlZS1ydXRnZXJzLXByb2Zlc3NvcnMtcmVjZWl2ZS1ncmFudC10by1kZXNpZ24taW1wcm92ZWQtdS1yZWN5Y2xpbmfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Daily Targum,"Three Rutgers Business School professors recently acquired a grant from the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection to improve the University’s recycling process.

Mark Rodgers Matthew Walsman and Kevin Lyons professors in the Department of Supply Chain Management received $206346 as part of the state’s Recycling Enhancement Grant Research program according to the article.

Their grant project entails designing a model for the University’s recycling program that reduces the amount of recyclable materials that get thrown away as garbage instead and vice versa which would prevent garbage from contaminating recyclables Lyons said according to the article.

“We really want to get to a model where it’s like a circular system — where we can use (waste) for something else or we can make something else with it” Lyons said. “At Rutgers for instance our carpeting that’s in some of our buildings was made from soda bottles and water bottles and such. So there's ways that you can do this but everybody has to be on the same page.”

Walsman said the project will involve recreating existing recycling models experimenting with new models implementing any beneficial ones and updating relevant professional tools accordingly. He said the University has been facing challenges in yielding desirable results from its current waste disposal program due to individual behavior.

“The process isn’t getting all of the returns that the University would like to see” Walsman said. “People throw away whatever they want into their bins right? So it’s not just recycling content or material ... it’s trash it’s contamination.”

Lyons said this may be partly because students think Rutgers is not truly recycling when it mixes all recyclables together in one container. But these materials get sorted at waste management facilities taking the responsibility out of consumers’ hands.

Prior to this method Lyons said the University used multiple containers to recycle materials but found that people mixed them regardless. He said both methods can be equally effective but people often discount their personal contributions and expect custodians to clean up after them.

“I really want the University to know that these individuals come to work every day and they really do help take care of us” he said. “So I’d just like folks to recognize our custodial and facilities maintenance people when they start to think about whether (they are) going to throw this in the right container or not.”

Walsman said he hopes their completed research will deliver an improved recycling system that can be implemented beyond Rutgers. At the same time he said it is important that individuals learn how to recycle correctly to make the most out of the system and help the environment making education an important part of the professors’ research as well.

“We're measuring and designing ... and innovating and it's not perfect but we're really appreciative that the state has recognized our efforts and is willing to support them as we try to make a small difference here” he said. “Hopefully people as they see it then they’ll become contributors and want to do their part.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9hYnMvcGlpL1MwOTYwMTQ4MTIxMDEzMjUy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Waste-to-energy forecasting and real-time optimization: An anomaly-aware approach,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0960148121013252 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9hYnMvcGlpL1MwOTYwMTQ4MTIxMDEzMjUy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Japan's navy on Friday morning identified a submerged vessel sailing northwest just outside territorial waters near Amami Oshima island part of Kagoshima prefecture the ministry said in a statement. A Chinese destroyer was also spotted in the vicinity.

Tokyo has complained of numerous intrusions by Chinese vessels of its territorial waters and near disputed islands in recent years. China has often reacted angrily to U.S. ships sailing through disputed areas of the South China Sea in what Washington calls displays of freedom of navigation.

Senior Chinese diplomat Wang Yi visiting Vietnam during a Southeast Asia trip said those two countries should refrain from unilateral actions regarding the South China Sea that could complicate and magnify disputes.

Barr Douglas W. Age 98 of Minneapolis passed away September 4 2021. He was loved and respected by many and will be truly missed by all who knew him. Doug was born to Arthur and Eva Barr August 13 1923 grew up on a family farm in Wood Lake MN excelled in studies and sports in his small-town high school and then went on to Harvard. After only one year there WWII broke out and he enlisted in the Army Air Corps studied Meteorology at University of Chicago and University of Wisconsin after which he was stationed in the Pacific theater forecasting weather for the planes and the crews flying missions there. He returned to Minneapolis graduated with a Bachelors in Civil Engineering and a Masters in Hydrology from the University of Minnesota. He met Sue-Marie Schreiber a smart cookie herself at a church dance and they were married in 1947. He worked as a Civil Engineer for several government agencies in MN and IA designing and improving community water systems. He had an ambitious independent streak and convinced Adolf Meyer the leading hydrologist in Minneapolis to bring him in as an associate. In 1953 Doug started an engineering consulting firm. The company grew and he formed Barr Engineering Co. as an employee-owned corporation. From its initial focus on hydrology and water management Barr Engineering has become awarded and acclaimed experts in many fields. The company culture at Barr Engineering was based on Doug's free-form thinking that every employee could work as if they were a consultant and manage their own time. His innovative approach and warm welcoming nature helped make Barr Engineering an engaging and rewarding place to work. The company has grown to 10 offices in the U.S. and Canada with over 900 employees. In addition to innumerable awards earned by Barr Engineering Doug was recognized with many awards including the Minnesota Society of Professional Engineers' Engineer of the Year (1989) and the University of Minnesota Regents' Outstanding Achievement Award (2010). Doug had a strong work ethic but also gave back to the community as a mentor for students at U of M Engineering college and as an active member of several engineering professional societies. He valued physical health and ran two miles every day even through MN winters until into his 90's. He was an Eagle Scout played pick-up basketball with men less than half his age into his 80's loved canoe trips in the Boundary Waters and enjoyed sailing on Lake Harriet. He had a soft spot for Verdi operas enjoyed ballroom dancing and sang bass in the Lake Harriet Methodist Church choir. He was very much a family man; Sue-Marie was his heart and soul for 54 years until her death. Later he met his wonderful second wife Janet Kramer a writer. He and Janet enjoyed traveling throughout the world his last 18 years. Preceded in death by Sue-Marie (Schreiber) Barr siblings Jean Johnson Dorothy Webb Wayne Barr his granddaughter Nydia Ruscio niece Janet Holmquist and nephews Bret and Peter Kip Schreiber. Survived by wife Janet Kramer-Barr children Kelton (Shari) David (Patty) and Ginni Barr-Ruscio (Michael) sister Barbara Bigwood sister-in-law Toby Schreiber grandchildren Anitsa Alex Nathan Jenna Jackson and Cooper eight great-grandchildren twelve nieces and nephews; as well as his step-children and grandchildren by Janet.

A bank manager at a Wells Fargo in California was beaten after his shift ended by a client who refused to wear a face mask according to The San Luis Obispo Tribune.

An unnamed man who is described as being in his mid-40s and bald walked into the Grover Beach bank on September 3 and ""responded aggressively"" after being told to put on a mask The Tribune reported.

Justin Hawkins is an exception.

“It’s actually one of my favorite topics” said Hawkins region president for Wells Fargo who oversees consumer and small business banking operations for most of South Carolina except the Hilton Head market. “We’ve all been through the pain of watching branches close but I think we’ve done it the right way.”

A newly issued report from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. puts some fresh numbers on the industry’s steady pullback.

The agency's annual accounting of market-share data showed that 28 branches or about 2 percent went dark across South Carolina between mid-2020 and mid-2021 trimming the net balance to 1171 locations.

The most active consolidator during that period was Truist Financial Corp. which this year is taking its cost-cutting axe to about 400 overlapping BB&T and SunTrust locations that it took on when it combined the two regional players in late 2019. In the Palmetto State 17 of the branches were shuttered according to the FDIC report.

First-Citizens of Raleigh was second to Truist with 10 closings followed by Wells Fargo with eight.

South Carolina isn't an outlier. A record 3324 branches were closed nationwide in 2020 or more than three times the number of openings according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.

The pace of the retrenchment has been accelerating. In South Carolina for example banks turned off the lights at 153 branches between 2011 and 2016. But during the past five years closings jumped 76 percent to 270 the FDIC said.

A steady stream of bank buyouts that keeps realigning the business is one of the key culprits as Truist can attest to. The urge-to-merge has whittled the number of lenders that do business in South Carolina to 76 from 116 over the past decade.

Another factor is that customers are more comfortable using ATMs and personal technology to handle routine tasks such as depositing checks through their smartphones. As a result Hawkins said branches are increasingly becoming ""advice centers"" as opposed to their former primary roles as ""transactional centers.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vd2VsbHMtZmFyZ28tZmluZWQtMjUwLW1pbGxpb24tcmVndWxhdG9ycy1zYXlzLTIwMTYtb3JkZXItZXhwaXJlZC0yMDIxLTnSAWtodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuY29tL3dlbGxzLWZhcmdvLWZpbmVkLTI1MC1taWxsaW9uLXJlZ3VsYXRvcnMtc2F5cy0yMDE2LW9yZGVyLWV4cGlyZWQtMjAyMS05P2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wells Fargo fined $250 million by regulators says a 2016 order has expired,"Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf testifies before a House Financial Services Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington U.S.

Reuters



Wells Fargo was hit with a $250 million fine levied by the OCC related to its mortgage business.

The bank said that a separate 2016 consent order over sales practices has now expired.

Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf has been on a mission to reshape the bank since joining in 2019.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

Even as Wells Fargo announced the expiration of a 2016 consent order levied by federal regulators in the wake of a fraudulent account scandal it now faces a new $250 million fine related to issues stemming from the bank's mortgage loss modification practices.

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said that the civil money penalty and a related cease-and-desist order have been brought against the bank for ""unsafe or unsound practices"" related to its mortgage servicing business and for failing to address compliance and risk issues raised in a 2018 OCC consent order.

""Wells Fargo has not met the requirements of the OCC's 2018 action against the bank. This is unacceptable"" Michael J. Hsu acting comptroller of the currency said in a statement Thursday accompanying the announcement.

""In addition to the $250 million civil money penalty that we are assessing against Wells Fargo today's action puts limits on the bank's future activities until existing problems in mortgage servicing are adequately addressed"" he continued.

The new order will require ""the bank to take broad and comprehensive corrective actions to improve the execution risk management and oversight of the bank's loss mitigation program"" the OCC said. The $250 million penalty will be paid to the US Treasury.

In a statement released Thursday Wells Fargo simultaneously acknowledged the OCC's disciplinary action and said that a separate 2016 consent order levied by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau over Wells Fargo's sales practices had expired effective Wednesday.

""Building an appropriate risk and control infrastructure has been and remains Wells Fargo's top priority"" Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf said in the statement. ""The OCC's actions today point to work we must continue to do to address significant longstanding deficiencies.""

Scharf has been on a mission to reshape the bank since joining in 2019 overhauling its internal reporting structure to more tightly control risk and promote accountability. The bank has also sold its asset management and corporate trust businesses in an effort to cut costs and focus on core businesses like consumer banking.

The 2016 CFPB consent order was brought against Wells Fargo after the bank was revealed to have opened millions of fraudulent accounts in a wide-ranging customer-abuse scandal. The expiration of the order Scharf said in the statement was ""representative of progress we are making.""

The bank remains under other restrictions levied by federal regulators including a 2018 asset cap imposed by the Federal Reserve.

Insider also detailed the sweeping transformation occurring in Wells Fargo's executive ranks as Scharf looks to prove to regulators and customers that the bank has progressed beyond scandal. More than 90 top executives have joined Wells Fargo from outside the bank since 2019.

""Our management team is fundamentally different today than what it was a year and a half ago"" Scharf said on a conference call in May.

by SF Bay View Staff

Revised Sept. 21 2021 – In May Manny Otiko’s reporting in the SF Bay View broke the story of rampant mismanagement at the Booker T. Washington Community Service Center in San Francisco’s Fillmore District. Since then additional facts have come to light linking the current problems at the traditionally esteemed community center to on-going political corruption and cronyism in Mayor Breed’s City Hall.

The Booker T. Washington Community Service Center (BTWCSC) at 800 Presidio Ave. has been a mainstay for the Black community in San Francisco since its inception just over one hundred years ago. By the early 2000s the building the center had inhabited since the early 1950s was run down and unable to meet the evolving needs of its diverse constituents.

In 2006 under the tenacious leadership of Executive Director Patricia Scott and Board President Julian Davis the center began implementing an intensive strategic plan resulting in the construction of a state-of-the-art multi-million-dollar multi-use complex including a new community center focused on youth and families gymnasium child-care facility and affordable housing with dedicated units and supportive services for emancipated foster youth. Additional assistance with the development of the new center came from long-time board member Phillip Stone.

With support from local state and federal funding opportunities and an impressive capital campaign the new center broke ground in 2015 and opened its new doors in 2017.

In many ways the center is ideally poised to do far more for the community it serves than ever before. And yet with fresh revelations that bad actors on the board of directors closely associated with Mayor London Breed are intent on using their position at the new center to enrich their cronies instead of serving the community recent events have proved that success all too often falls prey to circling wolves.

Allegations concerning the center’s current flawed governance are coming from its former board president Julian Davis. Davis a California attorney specializing in corporate and non-profit governance returned to the center’s board of directors in 2017 after a five-year hiatus to help the newly reconstructed facility to professionalize its operations. Davis says he encountered stiff resistance from the center’s officers in response to his insistence on basic compliance and proper governance for which he was controversially and improperly ousted in retaliation in April of this year.

The Bay View recently sat down with Mr. Davis to dig more deeply into the culture of cronyism and corruption that he says reaches beyond existing reports of political corruption at City Hall and ethics violations by Mayor Breed to encompass unethical and unlawful interventions in the community-based nonprofit sector.

Davis’s challenges began upon his return to the board when he was nominated and appointed secretary to reinstitute adequate record keeping. The center did not possess a set of board meeting minutes for the roughly five-year period from 2012-2017 during which Laurence Griffin a close associate of Mayor Breed had served as board president.

Moreover Mr. Griffin and the treasurer at the time Phillip Stone sought to prevent Davis from obtaining lawfully required approval from the board of directors for a resolution approving a multi-million-dollar loan from the City and County of San Francisco.

The incident prompted Davis to resign as secretary instead of bowing to pressure from Griffin and Stone to breach fiduciary duties. Mr. Stone’s attorney profile on the State Bar of California website shows an extensive record of licensure suspension and disbarment after disciplinary charges and conviction.

Davis says he first became aware of objectionable and unethical activities in connection with Mayor Breed in 2018 when board Vice President Farah Makras reported on conversations between herself and the mayor regarding the center’s hiring process when the center hired Regina Marsh to come from Indianapolis to serve as its executive director. According to Davis subsequent actions by Ms. Makras and Mr. Griffin to offer Ms. Marsh additional employment compensation beyond levels supported by the market and prior resolution of the board of directors directly benefited Makras Real Estate which received payments for Ms. Marsh’s living accommodations in San Francisco.

Makras Real Estate is owned and operated by Ms. Makras’s husband Victor Makras a politically connected real estate mogul who recently resigned from the Port Commission over alleged ethics violations.

Davis alleges that Ms. Makras was at it again earlier this year after conversations with Mayor Breed in her attempt to hire the mayor’s close friend and associate Brenda Wright as an overpaid consultant to fill the role of interim executive director. Brenda Wright a former Wells Fargo Community Relations Manager is also the long-time romantic partner of Steve Bowdry who joined the board as the organization’s treasurer in 2019.

According to Davis Ms. Makras stated that she had received assurances from Mayor Breed to pay for the excessive cost of Ms. Wright’s consulting fees with additional grants from the City of San Francisco if the center would hire her. Under state and federal regulations these proposed transactions are unlawful representing gross misuses of public and charitable funds as well as unethical conflicts of interest.

Molodestskaya’s post on Instagram of this screenshot from Celine Bossart’s Guest of a Guest article tags Makras and Breed. Bossart’s original photo slide is published here: https://guestofaguest.com/san-francisco/events/the-napa-set-stepped-out-for-the-most-fashionable-wine-gala-of-the-summer?slide=9.

When the center subsequently passed on hiring Ms. Wright Mr. Griffin moved to obtain the position for himself. In a March 28 letter addressed to Board President Carlos Reed Davis again advised against the proposed insider transaction stressing that his objection to Mr. Griffin’s takeover of the center was not personal but rather based on numerous concerns related to the aging Mr. Griffin’s lack of qualifications past breaches of fiduciary duties and cognitive condition.

Davis’s letter explains that Mr. Griffin has no experience running a non-profit community center with a $1M plus budget that he oversaw a lengthy period of negligent record keeping at the center and that he suffers from frequent and concerning disorientation and memory loss that are evident to all during meetings of the board of directors. Mr. Griffin’s appointment would not according to Davis have shown the appropriate care and prudence expected for the stewardship of substantial public funds held in trust to be used by the community center for charitable purposes.

Mr. Griffin withdrew his name from consideration and arranged with Ms. Makras to improperly remove Davis at the following board meeting. This may have been the only qualification that mattered to Mayor Breed however who subsequently nominated Mr. Griffin to serve on the City’s Recreation and Park Commission. Mr. Griffin is scheduled to be sworn in on Thursday Sept. 23 at 12:30 p.m. at Lincoln Park without a public hearing before the full Board of Supervisors. The only way a qualified commissioner can now be appointed to the vacant seat is if Mr. Griffin again withdraws his name from consideration.

In response to the cascading mismanagement cronyism and corruption he witnessed Davis filed a complaint with the Attorney General’s Registry of Charitable Trusts in May after the center’s executive committee failed to respond to a letter from his attorney requesting that action be taken to address a litany of alleged ethical fiduciary and legal violations.

The complaint shared with the Bay View includes factual allegations of unaddressed embezzlement by the center’s former Executive Director Regina Marsh the dual role of Carlos Reed as both board president of the center and athletic director of the chief tenant of the center’s gymnasium (Drew School) without any regard for the inherent conflicts in such an arrangement – conflicts that manifested in harm to the center in the form of unpaid rent.

The complaint includes attempts by officers to prevent matters of critical importance to the center from being reviewed and approved by the board (including the executive committee’s efforts to assume exclusive control over the hiring of an executive director while refusing requests by board members for information on candidates in violation of California Corporate Code Section 6334) the refusal of Board President Carlos Reed to accept counsel on corporate governance offered by the center’s attorney and the retaliatory and procedurally defective attempt to remove Davis following his objections to the above matters.

The center has since hired a City Hall insider for the role of executive director pursuant to the same hiring process that Davis alleges was defective under California law. According to Davis the man in charge of the hiring process board member Tony Tucker who until recently worked full time as manager of partnership development for the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce was not only improperly appointed by the executive committee to assume control over the hiring process but proceeded to consider only those candidates for the position personally vetted and approved by Mayor Breed.

The choice of Tucker and he board Shakirah Simley is a former aide to Vallie Brown who lost the District 5 supervisor seat to Dean Preston after being appointed by Breed. Among other neighborhoods District 5 includes the Fillmore District where the Booker T. Washington Community Service Center is located.

Not surprisingly then Davis’ letters to the center’s board of directors are not the only ones to have gone unheeded. In a letter to Board President Carlos Reed dated July 9 Supervisor Dean Preston writes that his “office has heard from constituents and community leaders who have voiced concerns about these allegations.” He continues “I am writing to request additional information from BTWCSC leadership regarding these serious allegations including any plans you may have to address the matters raised.”

As of now Davis reports there has been no substantive reply to the Supervisor’s inquiry by the center’s board of directors.

In his interview with the Bay View Davis said he will not relent until the bad actors on this board of directors resign and allow new competent and appropriate leadership to take the helm of the center. He said his objections are not only related to the unethical and unlawful activities he charges in his complaint to the attorney general.

In a recent email to a large list of community and professional contacts Davis writes: “Black community organizations require mission-aligned leadership to implement their purpose. Instead community center VP Farah Makras informed me that many of her friends voted for Donald Trump. Later her colleague and board member Zach Abrams implied ‘the steal is real’ by questioning whether there could be justice in America in light of Biden’s presidency. These are not the types of characters capable of providing appropriate community-based leadership in San Francisco.”

Adding that this same cabal of board members is currently promoting the recall of San Francisco District Attorney Chesa Boudin one of the most progressive and Black Lives Matter-sympathetic DAs in the country Davis reiterated how unacceptable and inappropriate their board membership is for a Black community-based organization in San Francisco.

The politics of the center’s namesake Booker Taliaferro Washington were hardly radical by contemporary or modern standards. His Atlanta Compromise capitulated to segregation as much as it enjoined Blacks and whites alike to “cast down your bucket where you are” in civic friendship and mutual aid. His philosophy however embraced Black excellence and leadership in education and industry and promoted the foundation and maintenance of community institutions like the one bearing his name in San Francisco’s Fillmore District.

Here at the Bay View we cannot understand how Mayor Breed’s interventions at the Booker T. Washington center could possibly serve that legacy. After supporting the mayor’s campaign we demand accountability of our cultural institutions to the basic causes of social justice. If there is one take away from recent events at the Booker T. Washington center it is that this humble purpose is sorely missing.

Bay View staff can be reached at editor@sfbayview.com or 415-671-0789. We will continue to follow Julian Davis as he courageously pursues accountability and transparency in this ongoing political scandal of unchecked corruption in City Hall.

Afterword by Mary Ratcliff: The Black community must control Black institutions

In the U.S. slavery was designed to dehumanize. The same dehumanization is practiced under current-day slavery that remains legal under the 13th Amendment in our prisons and jails.

Some Africans managed to free themselves before the Civil War among them the ancestors of my husband Dr. Willie Ratcliff. Those heroes traveled to the “no man’s land” they’d heard of in Deep East Texas where vigilantes were fighting for control of six counties that belonged to no nation. “If you commit to declaring this land free – no slavery – we’ll help you” they told one faction that was then able to win control.

Calling their new home East Liberty the Africans acquired some 5000 acres of fertile land that supplied nearly all their needs. When Dr. Ratcliff was young the mailman was the only white person allowed on their land; even the sheriff had to ask permission. They governed themselves and they thrived. Most of the adults had college degrees and the principal of his school built and run by the community had a PhD.

Dr. Ratcliff came to San Francisco with East Liberty in his heart. He knows from experience that Black people can control their own communities their own economy their own institutions. He has spent his life abolishing barriers – barriers so ubiquitous here that this city rife with anti-Black racism has driven out almost all but the last Black man in San Francisco – even under a Black mayor.

The Bay View newspaper’s strong support of Mayor London Breed is not blind. When she compromises the ability of the Black community to control Black institutions especially one as revered as the Booker T. Washington Community Service Center we feel compelled to object. It’s dehumanizing to prevent Black self-sufficiency.

A rumor that the Bay View was paid to publish this article is absolutely false and insulting. The Bay View has never taken a dime to publish a story not even an obituary. The Bay View is not for sale and neither is Booker T. Let us call on the mayor and her friends in high places to recognize the sovereignty of the Black community over its own institutions.

Mary Ratcliff and Dr. Willie Ratcliff having proudly passed the editorial torch to Nube Brown continue to serve as publishers of the Bay View and can be reached at mary@sfbayview.com. This is fundamentally the same story published Sept. 12 but the interview with Julian Davis has been revised with additional information and clarification and the afterword by Mary Ratcliff added."

The reinforced concrete edifice now stands topped out at 18 stories tall and will eventually open as a senior living facility on Manhattan’s Upper West Side. Designed by SLCE Architects and developed by Welltower Inc. and Hines the 230-foot-tall building will yield a total of 162 residences that will be spread across 109315 square feet averaging 674 square feet apiece. YIMBY last reported that the supportive programming will specifically focus on providing memory care while half of the units will be reserved for seniors with memory and cognitive disorders. Broadway 85 LLC is the owner and Hunter Robert Construction Group is the general contractor for the project located at the corner of Broadway and West 85th Street.

Since YIMBY’s last update back in mid-May the superstructure climbed from just a few floors above street level to the flat roof parapet and crown. We can see a number of workers on the main western elevation of 2330 Broadway putting together the different materials and layers of the facade. One of the floors above the sidewalk scaffolding is already fully enclosed in windows that feature dark mullions. The floor-to-ceiling square voids on the levels directly above are being lined with a blue waterproof membrane and even further up are crews assembling narrow walls that subdivide the distance between the perimeter concrete columns into the grid we see being formed. A setback is found roughly two-thirds of the way up that gently pushes back the upper floors of the building from the sidewalks. This space will be a wrap-around landscaped terrace as depicted in the main rendering. Meanwhile the back side has a couple of flat and blank concrete walls that indicate the core and egress shafts.

2230 Broadway is depicted to be wrapped in large stone blocks on the first two levels followed by a light-colored and warm brick surface with groups of two-story rectangular segments interspersed with dark spandrels. On top will be mechanical systems hidden from view behind black metal grilles. A canopy is shown to hang over the main entrance and sidewalks facing Broadway. Inside will be double-height amenity spaces that include a spa a homeopathic care center a bistro for residents and a rooftop garden.

A completion date for 2330 Broadway is posted on the construction board for next spring.

After a lengthy development period of more than 15 years the musical premiered at the Manchester Opera House in February 2020. It was set to run for 12 weeks before transferring to London's West End but then you-know-what happened and the remaining Manchester dates were cancelled in March 2020.

Finally though Back to the Future: The Musical has arrived at the Adelphi Theatre in London and Gale – who co-wrote the movie with Robert Zemeckis and wrote the book for the musical – believes it's as close as fans are ever going to get to a new movie.

Sean Ebsworth Barnes

""People of course had been clamouring for more Back to the Future forever and we had steadfastly said 'No we're not going to do a Part IV and we don't want to reboot it'. We set a really high bar for ourselves with those three movies and we don't want people coming out of a remake saying 'Man they messed it up'"" he tells Digital Spy.

""[The musical] was a way to revisit it without tampering with the lore of the movie. Nobody who sees the musical is ever going to get it confused with the movie and that has worked really well to our advantage.

""When people say 'I want to see Back to the Future Part IV' what they're really saying is 'I want to see a Back to the Future movie that makes me feel the same way I felt when I saw that first movie'. That's a tall order but I think that the musical fulfils that.""

With Olly Dobson and Roger Bart stepping into the formidable shoes of Michael J Fox and Christopher Lloyd as Marty and Doc Brown respectively the musical retells the story of the original movie. The idea to adapt the beloved movie into a musical started back in 2005 when Zemeckis's wife Leslie Harter suggested it after seeing The Producers.

Gale and Zemeckis got together with Glen Ballard and Alan Silvestri who both provide the music and lyrics. They realised the fact that Marty was a musician made it the perfect fit along with Doc Brown being a ""larger-than-life"" character who would work as a stage role.

Sean Ebsworth Barnes

Revisiting the original movie gave Gale a new perspective and allowed him to add certain elements to reflect on the time that's passed since it was released in 1985.

""We're now looking back at the '80s in the way that Bob Zemeckis and I looked back at the '50s when we wrote the movie. So there are little bits of social comment about the '80s and the 21st century in there"" he explains.

""Just as a small example one of the benches in the town square in 1985 is promoting a video store with video rentals. Today people are like 'What are video rentals? What does that mean?'. It's a nice little period detail that we would never have thought about in 1985.""

Back to the Future fans might still notice some differences from the movie though both because 1985 was a different time and because there are certain things in a movie that wouldn't work on stage.

That means for things like the terrorist chase and skateboard pursuit are out but in their place are new tweaks that ""dramatically work exactly as they did"" and callouts to movie moments they couldn't do on stage. It's all part of trying to make the musical different enough to the movie yet still quintessentially Back to the Future.

Sean Ebsworth Barnes

Of course there's still the DeLorean and that iconic clock tower among other Back to the Future staples that fans can look forward to. ""The stagecraft is absolutely incredible"" Gale enthuses.

""What was really gratifying for me is that of course everybody associated with the production they're big fans of the movie. And so their love for the property their love for the movie got translated into them saying 'You know what? This is Back to the Future. I really have to step up my game here.'

""The movie's well-known for all the little Easter eggs and details that permeate through them. That idea of just coming up with every little possible detail that you can and trying to figure out how do we weave that in that's going through every department.



""It works wonderfully with the music because in the movie we have motifs from 1985 that get repeated in 1955. That's a perfect thing to be able to do in a musical. It gives you a total perfect reason to have a reprise of a song with different lyrics that fit the time period and fit the character.""

Sean Ebsworth Barnes Bob Gale during rehearsals

Whether long-term fans of the series or newcomers it feels as though Back to the Future: The Musical will have something for everyone.

Even those who saw it during its all-too brief Manchester run will notice ""little tweaks"" from that version. The unintentional extended break has allowed the producers to realise things they didn't have time to do in Manchester as well as make lyric revisions to the songs (which otherwise remain the same).

And although Gale has ruled out ever doing another Back to the Future movie he's already prepared for there to be calls to go full-circle and turn the musical into a movie.

""Studios don't want to make original stuff. They want sequels spinoffs stuff based on other mediums whatever. Now they'll start saying 'Well how about you guys making a movie out of the musical?'. Well no"" he says with a laugh.

""When you see it in a theatre you'll understand why I say that. Because being there with the characters there on stage with all the stagecraft that we do it is really an experience unto itself. That's the case with all great live theatre so we want people to see this on stage.

""And trust me you will get your money's worth.""

He was the oldest of three sons of John Graham Sudbury and Avis Sudbury born February 13 1933 and raised in Blytheville Arkansas. After graduation from Blytheville High School Graham became a lifelong Razorback with a degree in journalism from the University of Arkansas in 1955. His work on the student newspaper the Traveler and the college press club ignited his admiration for the written word that would influence his career and life. Following college Graham served in the U.S. Army intelligence division worked as a reporter for the Commercial Appeal of Memphis and moved on to join national public relations and marketing firms ultimately accepting a corporate position at Campbell Soup's headquarters near Philadelphia. There he helped orchestrate a national marketing campaign including a coast to coast tour with then movie and TV star Lassie promoting the launch of Lassie's ""favorite"" dog food recipe. Graham said both he and Lassie had a great time. In 1978 he took a position as Director of Corporate Communications at The Williams Companies in Tulsa Okla. where he stayed until 1991. Graham and Michael were next off to their new retirement home in Taos New Mexico filled with bookcases and spectacular views of Taos Mountain. Graham enjoyed traveling the world but especially to Italy France and our national parks. He seldom bypassed an open museum or declined to lend his talent for public relations and fund raising advertising to arts groups. He served on the Boards of the Tulsa Opera the Millicent Rogers Museum in Taos and was a regular at the Santa Fe Opera the Gilcrease Museum a playwright reading group in Tulsa and the Harwood Museum in Taos. Not content to be merely an observer Graham wrote and directed several plays each with multiple performances at the Taos Community Auditorium. Alas neither Broadway nor Hollywood beckoned but he loved every minute of it! Graham's trademark was his ""flat top"" crew cut haircut. It gave him instant credibility and no doubt was the reason he was invited to appear not once but twice as an impersonator on the 1970's TV series ""To Tell the Truth"". He first impersonated the director of NASA's Apollo moon missions receiving three of the four celebrity panelist's votes. The next year he appeared with a famed mountain climber who had ascended Grand Teton at age 16 and the Matterhorn twice in one day. Graham got all four votes as the real mountain climber including one from the same panelist that had voted for him as the Apollo mission director! The written word in a book periodical or newspaper was Graham's best friend. His bookcases overflowed. He especially liked history mystery spies and Sherlock Holmes. This led to his enthusiastic participation attired with his deerstalker hat and calabash pipe in the Sherlock Holmes Society. He lamented the demise of the daily newspaper. When his home delivery of the Sunday New York Times ceased he became a regular in the early Sunday morning scrum at the drop off location for the always too few copies delivered to Taos. Graham never much cared for electronic newspapers or eBooks. He leaves behind his wife of 53 years Michael Moore Sudbury daughter Susan McArthur of Little Rock grandchildren Caleb Will Andrew and Amelia and brother David and wife Holly of Dallas Texas. He was predeceased by son Scott Graham Sudbury and brother Roger Wheatley Sudbury. The family will hold a private memorial service to honor Graham. The family wants to thank Graham's caregivers at Woodland Heights and especially Sherilyn Watson and close family friend Patrick Kelly. Memorials in Graham's name can be made to the Millicent Rogers Museum in Taos the Tulsa Opera a charity of your choice or simply by enjoying reading a good book.

It’s disappointing in that context to see that the new Sherwin-Williams headquarters proposed for downtown Cleveland is part of a new generation of bland and impersonal glassy offices and apartments rising across the city and indeed around the world.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpbmVtYWJsZW5kLmNvbS9uZXdzLzI1NzMyMzAvZ3JlYXQtbWljaGFlbC1rLXdpbGxpYW1zLW1vdmllcy1hbmQtdHYtc2hvd3MtYW5kLWhvdy10by13YXRjaC10aGVt0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,12 Great Michael K. Williams Movies And TV Shows And How To Watch Them,"CinemaBlend participates in affiliate programs with various companies. We may earn a commission when you click on or make purchases via links.

Michael K. Williams passed away at the age of 54 on September 6 2021 leaving behind a family and a body of work that is up there with some of the all-time greats from the medium. Throughout his acting career which went back to 1995 Williams gave life to the likes of Omar Little on The Wire Albert “Chalky” White on Boardwalk Empire and dozens of others who felt like fully-realized and three-dimensional people rather than characters on a show or in a movie. As we mourn the loss of one of the best actors of his time we should look back on Williams’ extensive library of shows and movies so that we can best remember the greatness of his craft. Here is just a sampling of the gifts Michael K. Williams had to offer us all.

The Wire (HBO Max)

David Simon’s HBO crime epic The Wire shows how the lives of those on opposite sides of the law and different neighborhoods of Baltimore Maryland are connected in one way or another including series standout Omar Little (Michael K. Williams) a modern-day Robin Hood in a trench-coat.

Why it’s worth watching: Not only is The Wire one of the greatest television dramas of all time it also features Michael K. Williams’ best characters in Omar Little. A good man who does bad things to bad people Omar was at times the funniest character on The Wire cast while others the most tragic of the bunch. It’s just a damn shame Williams never won an Emmy for this iconic performance.

Boardwalk Empire (HBO Max)

Set in Prohibition era Atlantic City New Jersey the HBO period crime drama Boardwalk Empire tells the story of the unforgettable characters who found a way to become not only profitable and successful with their various businesses but also feared for the manner in which they operate said businesses for better or worse.

Why it’s worth watching: Two years after he portrayed Omar Little for the final time (not counting the 2012 The Wire musical) Michael K. Williams played Albert “Chalky” White a powerful African-American gangster with his hands in various cookie jars throughout Boardwalk Empire’s Atlantic City. Beloved in his own community but feared in others Chalky was a dynamic character who appeared to always be one step ahead of the competition.

12 Years A Slave (Hulu)

Steve McQueen’s harrowing biographical drama 12 Years a Slave tells the story of Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejofor) a free African-American man living in New York who is kidnapped and sold into slavery in the years leading up to the Civil War kicking off more than a decade in captivity and failed attempts to free himself from the shackles of the south.

Why it’s worth watching: There is a long list of tragic characters in 12 Years a Slave including Robert (Michael K. Williams) one of the men that Solomon Northup meets on the slave ship early on in the movie. Even though he’s only in the movie for a few minutes Williams makes the most of his time and delivers a performance as a man willing to do anything to be free even if he has to die in the process.

The Night Of (HBO Max)

After being implicated in the murder of a young woman in New York City Pakistani-American college student Nasir “Naz” Khan’s (Riz Ahmed) finds himself going through the criminal justice system in hopes of clearing his name.

Williams) an influential prisoner who can make things happen to those living outside the jail’s walls just as much as he can to those wasting away in their cells.

Why it’s worth watching: Although it doesn’t receive as much acclaim as some of Michael K. Williams’ other crime shows Hap and Leonard is one that shouldn’t be overlooked.

Why it’s worth watching: Michael K. Williams is only in The Road for a few minutes but his performance as the thief who is forced to give his clothes to the father and son after being caught stealing their cart is one that can’t be missed. This emotionally-gutting scene is difficult to watch but helps illustrate one’s need for survival in a dying world.

WTW,Willis Towers Watson,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZW5ld2RhaWx5LmNvbS5hdS9maW5hbmNlL3N1cGVyYW5udWF0aW9uLzIwMjEvMDkvMTIvc3VwZXJhbm51YXRpb24tZ2xvYmFsLXJhbmtpbmdz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Australian superannuation funds have climbed the global rankings,"Australia’s superannuation system continues to punch above its weight in global rankings despite foreign markets eclipsing the local sharemarket in 2020 new research has found.

Local super funds delivered the fifth-best annual returns of any country over the past five years – coming behind only Russia Vietnam Colombia and India.

Key to their success was Australia’s focus on defined contribution schemes rather than defined benefit schemes.

Produced by actuaries Willis Towers Watson’s Thinking Ahead Institute and US publication Pensions & Investments the review of the world’s top 300 pension funds found that 16 Australian super funds made the top 300 when it came to total funds under management.

All bar one moved up the rankings in calendar 2020 with Rest Super falling two places to 110.

Aware Super made the biggest gain rising 22 places as a result of its merger with VicSuper.

Australia’s largest fund AustralianSuper came in at No.22 in the rankings while the nation’s sovereign wealth fund the Future Fund was the second-best local performer and ranked 25.

The rankings make Australia’s performance look artificially low as the structure of systems in other countries inherently leads to larger pools of savings.

A disparate system

Australia’s voluntary super scheme sees retirement savings held in 198 competing funds with the Future Fund reserved for unfunded Commonwealth superannuation liabilities.

But countries like Japan Norway Canada and South Korea along with some big US states hold national retirement savings or savings for particular industries in one mandated fund which leads to larger pools of savings than Australia’s disparate system.

Australia overachieves when it comes to the percentage of assets in the top 300 funds though coming in at sixth position and accounting for 4.4 per cent of the total.

That puts it ahead of major economies like the UK and Germany which rely more on government pension systems in retirement.

Solid growth

The growth performance of Australia’s major funds over the past five years also outshines many of its larger counterparts.

The average compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for leading Australian funds was about 12 per cent in local currency putting it behind only Russia Vietnam Colombia and India and well in front of other developed economies.

Those ahead of Australia in CAGR “have relatively underdeveloped pension systems which are growing quickly off a low base” said David Knox partner with superannuation consultancy Mercer.

Source: Willis Towers Watson

The design of Australia’s superannuation system is another reason why our super funds have performed well overall.

Across the world particularly in developed countries defined benefit schemes dominate making up 63.4 per cent of funds across the top 300 pension schemes.

But defined contribution schemes which account for the significant majority of funds in Australia accounted for only 23.9 per cent of assets in the top 300.

“Defined contribution schemes shift most of the risk for pensions to members while in defined benefit schemes employers carry the burden of specified payouts regardless of the state of the economy or markets” Chant West director Ian Fryer said.

The downside of defined benefits

Defined benefit schemes need far higher exposure to bonds to ensure they have enough money on hand to meet guaranteed payments when necessary. Bonds come with lower risk but also deliver lower returns.

Defined contribution schemes on the other hand are far more exposed to company shares (equities) because their members carry the risk of market fluctuations.

Although this means retirement balances can go up and down over the short term it delivers far higher returns and balances over time.

The report found the top 300 funds had an average equity exposure of 47.3 per cent – much lower than the average Australian balanced superannuation account (58 per cent in equity and equity-like investments).

Meanwhile all regions had higher allocations to bonds than the typical Australian portfolio.

Australian funds managed to grow their position last year despite a disparity in the local sharemarket.

“International shares grew 13.8 per cent over calendar 2020 despite the COVID crash while Australian shares only grew 1.7 per cent” Mr Fryer said.

However Australian funds managed to hold or improve their positions because of their big international share exposures and their holdings of unlisted and alternative assets which performed well.

Bigger is better

The survey also found that larger fund groupings were growing faster than their smaller counterparts.

The top 20 funds grew by an average of 8.9 per cent annually over the five years to 2020 while smaller funds grew by between 6.5 per cent and 7.9 per cent.

Globally this is not a result of higher investment performance.

“Larger funds are often sovereign wealth funds and their government owners have been tipping in more money in recent years” said Willis Towers Watson investment director Martin Goss.

Locally mergers help explain why larger funds account for a growing share of the market.

“In Australia we are seeing a lot of small super funds merge into larger funds and the largest ones are getting more than their fair share” Mr Goss said.

“First State Super went into Aware Super QSuper and Sunsuper have merged and a number of smaller funds went into AustralianSuper.”

Five years ago the top 20 funds accounted for 40 per cent of the top 300 assets but by December this was up to 41.8 per cent.

Almost half of the strong growth rate in funds under management was earned during 2020 when funds among the top 20 grew by 14.6 per cent and among all funds surveyed by 11.5 per cent.

But many Nevada businesses and public institutions have already put their own employee vaccine mandates in place with more in the works as the federal government finalizes the new rule and fleshes out its finer points. Some have gone further by requiring vaccinations not just for employees but as a condition of entry for members of the public including at conventions athletic events and concerts.

At the same time some rural governments have passed resolutions banning vaccine mandates to varying degrees.

Amiri helmed by LA-based designer Mike Amiri is known for its Californian rock ‘n’ roll and streetwear fusion. In his new spring collection the luxury designer stuns everyone with his interpretation of a Californian pining for places away from home. The pre-recorded fashion film was held in Wynn Las Vegas— the same location for which the brand will open its new stores later this year.

The runway show was filmed by Cara Striker and boasted Wynn Las Vegas’ luxurious backdrop complete with the tropical hotel lounge and the gorgeous man-made waterfall. The collection struck as a romantic escapist fantasy; ideal for anyone who wishes for any place but home. The greenery provided a calming background that made the clothes speak for themselves. The lucid feeling of tropical dreamscape was accompanied by Black Coffee’s soundtrack “Wish You Were Here”.

The new spring collection offers laid-back silhouettes without losing its sophisticated edge. These sophisticated elements came from Amiri’s use of prints and textiles. Prints like paisleys tropical plants sunsets and (funnily enough) the Zig-Zag Man gave an impression of a rockstar on vacation.

The LA designer is not one to shy away from textile manipulation either–besides he did not make shotgun-holed T-shirts and jeans for nothing! This time however he shredded braided and embroidered repurposed bandanas onto knit tops shorts and cardigans. And the craftsmanship does not end there there were also iced-dyed trousers (that took 3 days to make) hand-woven lace shirts and a lot of patchwork involved in this collection.

Looking at the collection as a whole though the silhouettes are simple. Just simple. There’s really nothing completely extraordinarily new here but it all came down to the intricacy of the details in each piece. From the collection of leather bags neck scarves and covetous espadrilles the styling elevates the presentation. Amiri also stands out for his use of textiles and textures. The bouclé double-breasted suit is a dream to look at and the patchwork trousers in all shades pastel looked so soft and buttery despite the rough stitch detailing. One must also commend the art of tailoring exhibited in this collection. The clothes looked relaxed enough without making them look lazy and frumpy.

The new Amiri man is looking to become more comfortable– away from skin-tight clothes and closer to a relaxed machismo aided with a neck scarf and a man-purse.

The lawsuit was filed Sept. 7 according to a press release from CORE Electric.

Xcel's operation of the Comanche plant ""deprived CORE of its expected energy output and damaged the physical asset co-owned by CORE"" the company stated in the press release. ""Unfortunately we could not reach a business solution after exhausting all reasonable efforts with Xcel so this lawsuit was a necessary step.""

The lawsuit comes eight days after the company formerly known as Intermountain Rural Electric Association (IREA) announced its rebranding as CORE Electric. The company claims to be one of the largest member-owned electric distribution cooperatives in the U.S.

A section of recently completed transmission line near the intersection of Quincy Avenue and Gun Club Road in Aurora. (credit: CBS4)

Specifically the complaint cites the plant's poor reliability since 2010. Most recently the complaint states Comanche 3 suffered a year-long shutdown (Jan. 2020-Jan. 2021) due to a damaged steam turbine. The complaint blames an employee for causing the damage and management for what it referred to as ""years of neglect.""

CORE Electric incurred millions of dollars in expenses due to Comanche's lack of output including the purchase of replacement power during those outages the suit claims.

The suit also seeks compensation for anticipated expenses resulting from Xcel plan to retire the Comanche plant early in 2040.

An Xcel Energy spokesperson told CBS4 its attorneys are preparing their case.

""We are still reviewing the documents"" Xcel's Michelle Aguayo wrote in an email ""and generally don't comment on pending lawsuits. That said Xcel Energy remains committed to ensuring the safe reliable operation of the plant through its proposed early retirement in 2040. Comanche 3 is one of the lowest cost generating plants on our system and has proven valuable to the system over its life.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiJGh0dHA6Ly9qYXp6cG9saWNlLmNvbS9hcmNoaXZlcy8xMjA2OdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Twin Cities Jazz Festival Returns!

“9/11 was the most significant thing in my life as a person whose parents are from Afghanistan” she said. “Everything in our lives has been shaped by 9/11. We were extremely ostracized. There was a lot of Islamophobia. I remember wishing so badly people didn’t want to talk about it with me. I just wanted them to let me assimilate and try to be a wallflower even though I’m brown.”

Now the 33-year-old Mommandi — a former teacher and current Ph.D. student at the University of Colorado Boulder’s School of Education — is helping create curriculum to educate beyond the headlines of 9/11 and teach how the terrorist attacks and their aftermath shaped the nation and world and continue to reverberate 20 years later.

The curriculum called “Teaching Beyond September 11” is a project spearheaded by Ameena Ghaffar-Kucher of the University of Pennsylvania’s Graduate School of Education and a group of educators scholars and community activists to help teachers deepen their students’ understanding of the horrific event and its long shadow.

“The stuff that’s out there for teachers — and I’ve been looking around a lot — is not great” Mommandi said. “This is really important history that’s not well-developed in terms of curriculum and materials.”

Many states including Colorado don’t require Sept. 11 to be taught in school. And not only were current high school students born into a post-9/11 world but some teachers just entering the profession are young enough to have only been a few years old at the time of the attacks and the start of America’s longest war which just ended last month.

With 9/11’s transition to an increasingly distant historic event The Denver Post asked Colorado educators and students how they think textbooks should address the life-altering terror attacks and the complex events that led up to that day and emanated from it.

State curriculum standards

Dale Munholland an American history teacher at Arvada’s Pomona High School is often taken aback when reminded his students have no memory of 9/11.

“It seems so fresh and recent in your mind and then you talk to the kids and you’re shocked because it’s like ‘Oh yeah you weren’t even alive'” Munholland said.

Munholland said teaching 9/11 is largely left up to educators and that there isn’t much information about it — if any — in the history textbooks he’s seen.

Curriculum decisions in Colorado are left up to individual school districts. The state does have standards which act as a road map for what a child should know at a specific grade level said Jeremy Meyer spokesman for the Colorado Department of Education.

However the Sept. 11 attacks are not explicit in the state’s social studies standards he said. High school state history standards do mention the war on terror as an example of a lesson analyzing the complexity of events throughout the United States.

Colorado isn’t alone. A 2017 analysis of social studies standards across the 50 states and the District of Columbia found that 26 specifically included the Sept. 11 attacks and nine included terrorism or the war in terror more broadly. But 16 states’ standards didn’t mention 9/11 or terrorism at all according to the study.

Munholland said he tries to connect 9/11 to his students’ lives by explaining things like how and why it impacted airport security and discussing how the subsequent Patriot Act influenced surveillance of American citizens. He said he wants students to learn about the good and bad things that came out of the event.

“The almost instantaneous unity in the U.S. that happened the bipartisanship and this euphoric patriotism that came about and people felt together as one as opposed to being very divided” Munholland said. “But then also negative issues like the anti-Islamic and Arab sentiments.”

A place of empathy

Haley Gossett a 16-year-old in the Army Junior Reserve Officers’ Training Corps program at Colorado Springs’ Mitchell High School said the majority of her knowledge about 9/11 came from JROTC.

She learned about the nearly 3000 people killed in the terrorist attacks and the grieving families left behind. She learned about the first responders who risked their lives that day — many dying and others returning with post-traumatic stress disorder and illness. She learned about the racism and Islamophobia that Muslim people faced following the attacks and two ensuing wars.

Mitchell High School conducts an annual 9/11 observance in which students help honor the lives lost in the attacks — including 1975 graduate Kathryn Yancey LaBorie a flight attendant on United Airlines Flight 175 which flew into the World Trade Center.

Gossett whose father was in the Army said she’s interested in learning how other countries reacted to 9/11 and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. The teen who was born four years after the terrorist attacks said she’s considering going into the military.

“I want to learn about how it affected Muslims and how they felt in our country after that because I know a lot of the racism but I just can’t imagine what that would feel like for them” Gossett said.

Mommandi knows that feeling all too well.

The curriculum she’s helping create comes from a place of empathy critical thinking and that global perspective Gossett is interested in Mommandi said.

Mommandi wants students to know how much money the United States spent on the post-9/11 wars — more than $8 trillion according to the Costs of War project at Brown University — and where that money went. She wants students to analyze the reasons elected officials gave for going to war. She wants students to learn about the human toll of war on a global scale. She wants students to agree on a definition of terrorism and see which other leaders in history might fit that definition.

“What are the true costs of war?” Mommandi said. “That is absolutely important.”

Offering a variety of viewpoints

Anton Schulzki a Colorado Springs social studies teacher is the president of the National Council for the Social Studies. He was still deciding how to teach 9/11 this year but said it can be taught from different subject matters. A government teacher could discuss how 9/11 impacted different government agencies or challenged the Constitution he said. An economics teacher could talk about how much money the U.S. spent on the war in Afghanistan.

Schulzki said he always keeps in mind that in a city like Colorado Springs with a heavy military presence students may have parents or family members who served in the war.

“We try to present sources with a variety points of view and let students be critical of those” Schulzki said. “The perspective we’re teaching is one lens and a lens from another student in another country might be totally different. I think that’s a very important part of student’s education is to learn there are multiple points of view. It’s not the teachers’ responsibility to say what’s correct.”

Mulholland thinks enough time has passed that his class can have a discussion on the merits of the war in Afghanistan.

“We can now talk about was this worth it?” Mulholland said. “Was this the right thing to do knowing now 20 years later what we didn’t know then? It’s not my job to tell them what to think.”

Mullholland wants his students to walk out of class equipped with knowledge and resources to ensure an attack like 9/11 never happens again.

“My hope is that they would understand everything that happened that went into that event taking place and they would work to make sure that event never takes place again” Mullholland said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vZ29uZXB1Y2t3aWxkLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA5LzEyL21pbm5lc290YS13aWxkLWFuYWx5dGljcy1raXJpbGwta2Fwcml6b3ZzLXNvcGhvbW9yZS1zZWFzb24tcHJldmlldy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What could be in store in Kirill Kaprizov's sophomore season?,,,,

Time goes on. But it reminds us of the sole appreciation that we have always had for our family our friends our community and our country. He will be missed forever.”

These were the words of Helga Curtin on Nov. 20 2001 to identify the unique character of her late husband Michael Sean Curtin who was a sergeant major in the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve and a member of the New York City Emergency Services Unit.

On 9/11 Mike Curtin wished his wife a happy birthday sent flowers to her job and expected to arrive back at their Medford home where he was planning to make her a special dinner. On this beautiful late summer day the United States was attacked by terrorists and like many other rescue workers he answered the call to help others survive this tragic date.

As an Emergency Services Unit sergeant Curtin was no stranger to handling delicate situations. Being a member of a strong city law enforcement agency it was common for him to deal with a myriad of responsibilities.

He was well versed in leading hostage negotiations administering first aid facing suicide attempts and helping others through challenging rescues of citizens. He had significant experience through the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. It was observed that he spent a great deal of time working with law and government officials during this early terrorism attack on the city.

Always seen as a “squared away” leader through his time in the military his presence was always felt during every type of incident including Osama bin Laden’s first attempt to destroy this financial center.

Oklahoma City bombing and Harlem rescue

Two years later he was ordered after the Oklahoma City bombing to assist within recovery efforts at the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in that city. This building was devastated from domestic terrorism where 168 people were killed including six members of the Armed Forces.

During this support Curtin saw the red “blood stripe” of one of the two members of the Marine Corps that were lost in this debris.

Randy Guzman was a Marine captain who worked in the recruiting station that was located on the sixth floor of this building. Curtin noticed his remains and right away asked for permission to detach fellow law enforcement and military figures to help him dig through the rubble to properly recover the remains of Guzman.

For several hours Curtin led this difficult task of using heavy machinery to reach this deceased Marine. Curtin was a combat veteran of the first Gulf War who was with the American spearhead to liberate Kuwait from the Iraqi military.

He still served in the Marine Corps Reserves where he had the senior leadership rank of first sergeant. Once Curtin and his men reached Guzman this loud work site automatically became quiet as the body was carried out with an American flag placed over the fallen Marine.

Rarely speaking about his job Curtin recalled this somber moment and said “Everyone was watching in silence as we brought our Marine out.”

The following year members of the Guzman family and New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani (R) took a picture with Curtin to show appreciation for his determination and skills to assist the residents of Oklahoma City impacted by this explosion.

A good friend who worked closely with Curtin to handle the immense tasks of the Emergency Services is retired Lt. Owen McCaffrey of Bay Shore. This officer was Curtin’s supervisor of Truck 2 in Harlem that helped cover nine precincts from 86th Street to Washington Heights within Upper Manhattan.

Thinking of his good friend McCaffrey believed that Curtin was one of the finest sergeants within the New York City Police Department to lead his men. To this day McCaffrey vividly remembers the positive attributes of Curtin as being a “devoted reliable and trustworthy cop.”

He saw the positive influence of the Marine Corps on the presence of Curtin who always stressed the importance of training drilling his men and getting them to quickly think during all types of situations.

And while this Marine was a tough no-nonsense individual Curtin usually cooked his men a breakfast of eggs bacon and sausage. McCaffrey recalled that Curtin was a “solid supervisor that always looked after his men that were highly trained for their difficult jobs.”

The bravery that Curtin demonstrated never subsided and in 1999 he saved a trapped resident of a Harlem building before the structure collapsed.

September 11 2001

On 9/11 as Curtin was planning to return home for his wife’s birthday America was attacked. As our citizens were putting their children on school buses and handling their daily functions this nation was hit by the sting of terrorism in Manhattan Washington D.C. and over the farm fields of Shanksville Pennsylvania. Right away rescue workers headed toward the World Trade Center to help people escape the earliest moments of bin Laden’s assault on the United States. Curtin was with several other agency personnel who were quickly dispatched to aid others.

Never one to waver under any form of military or law enforcement duress he was on hand to guide his men with the goal to save as many people as possible. Through this challenging chaos Curtin and his fellow officers were in the middle of this attack that saw debris crashing around them and thousands of people trying to flee from this terror. At 9:59 a.m. the South Tower collapsed and it became apparent that the North Tower also hit by an aircraft would face the same the destruction.

As some of his men were several floors above him to assist others to escape the North Tower Curtin directed those officers around him to immediately leave this building before it collapsed and head for safety. He refused to follow them as according to McCaffrey he made the “conscious decision” to stay with those remaining men that were still in this building even as he realized that this building was going to eventually fall. At 10:28 a.m. officers from Truck 2 who were ordered to leave this location watched in dismay as the North Tower fell to the ground. They automatically realized that Curtin had passed away. He was one of 14 Emergency Services and Bomb Squad figures killed from these attacks on New York City.

Whereas the authorities knew where Curtin was buried in the rubble of Ground Zero it took until March 6 2002 to finally locate the remains of this 13-year veteran of the NYPD. His body was not fully removed until Helga Curtin and Police Commissioner Ray Kelly arrived at the location. They were met by an army of rescue workers law enforcement salvage crews and government officials who were silent as Curtin was taken out of the debris with a flag placed over his body. Within the early morning hours the motorcade that held Curtin was heading up FDR Drive in Manhattan. The streets were lined with police officers that stopped the traffic and saluted the remains of Curtin who was escorted by his wife and local law enforcement and military leadership. Four years after Curtin lost his life with other rescue workers President George W. Bush (R) posthumously awarded public safety officers the 9/11 Heroes Medal of Valor for those men and women who died in uniform during these attacks.

When speaking to different members of Curtin’s family the affection that they have for him has never diminished since he died. This Rocky Point High School student was a strong soccer player who worked at the local statuary on Route 25A. After he graduated in 1975 he enlisted into the Marine Corps. His strong smart and kind presence is still missed by his entire family from Helga and his daughters Jennifer Heather and Erika also younger loved ones who are immensely proud of his honorable achievements to support this country.

Annual golf outing

Over the last 17 years Curtin’s cousin Mike Finnican has been instrumental in organizing an annual golf outing that has been held at Cherry Creek in Riverhead. This function’s main goal is to remember Curtin and the numerous rescue workers and military members who have supported this country since 9/11. Finnican reflected on the hospitality of Curtin especially during a July 4 2001 barbecue that saw his cousin wear his red white and blue shorts as he cooked for his family and friends. Some 20 years later Finnican looked over the fairways and greens at Cherry Creek to see more than 300 people attend a golf outing that was held July 12. Finnican along with his wife children grandchildren and members of the Lukasz Dwyer and Curtin families all donated their time to support their 20th successful golf outing. During the day younger family members and friends wore smiles on their faces to sell raffle tickets and T-shirts for the 3256 Foundation. One of these included Michael Sullivan the 5-year-old grandson named after Curtin who was present with his parents and his cousins to support this family tradition.

Curtin’s custom was to be warm to others and this week his family and friends continued his legacy in making every participant of this outing feel welcome during a special annual event. Most people who read about the heroic exploits that Curtin presented in the military and the NYPD marvel at the abilities of this local graduate to serve at home and abroad. But this highly capable figure rarely addressed his experience and Finnican stated that Curtin “was a good man that never bragged about his experiences that was absolutely loyal to his family.”

It is safe to say that Curtin’s name will be remembered for some time through this yearly golf outing. With a color guard and the sounds of bagpipes laughter and stories that brought smiles to a crowd who listened intently about the professional stories of Curtin it was easy to tell that everyone who played golf and attended the dinner had a grand time in honoring this hero. At the end of the night there was a major raffle that saw people win televisions video games children’s toys restaurant gift cards and an auction of sports memorabilia and baseball tickets.

As the 20th anniversary of 9/11 approaches there will be noticeable grief to remember the almost 3000 people killed on that fateful day. But the golf outing had a surplus of smiles from the family members of Curtin and those law enforcement and military veterans who look forward to seeing each other to support this worthy endeavor.

The 3256 Foundation over the last two decades has created an important sense of comradery amongst its participants to never forget the moment that America was attacked. And this would not be possible if it were not for determination of Finnican and his team who have established one of the finest patriotic events in Suffolk County. Like Curtin his family members are patriots who seek little fanfare and they are motivated to reflect on a hero who spent his life defending this country in the Marines and always helping others in the NYPD.

May we never forget about rescue workers like Michael S. Curtin who were the earliest casualties of bin Laden’s attempt to harm the American way of life.",,,

Zoo Atlanta reports that at least 13 of their total 20 gorillas are presumptively positive with the SARS-CoV-2 virus -- this after several of them showed symptoms in recent days and got tests run by a local lab ... with more results forthcoming.

Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.

The symptoms ranged from runny noses coughing and changes in appetite ... and samples were collected via nasal swabs oral swabs and fecal matter. So far it looks like an outbreak.

The oldest of their gorillas is 60-year-old Ozzie who's also tested positive. He and the others are being treated with monoclonal antibodies and will receive the Zoetis vaccine soon -- which is the jab developed for animals and which several zoos have already administered.

As for how they got sick -- ZA says it believes a care team member that works there -- who proved to be positive after the fact -- might've been responsible for transmitting it ... unwittingly and not on purpose. They say this worker was fully vaxxed wearing a ton of PPE and was asymptomatic the day they reported to work when this presumably spread.

Doesn't seem any of the gorillas are deathly ill at this point but the Zoo is monitoring their condition. They're also letting visitors continue to see them ... as they say it's not possible for animals to give COVID to humans and the built-in viewing distance is safe enough.

One last thing ... Zoo Atlanta says they can't make the gorillas socially distance -- 'cause they kick it in groups (or troops) of 4 and apparently can't be separated.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vY2EubW92aWVzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9uZXdzL2dvcmlsbGFzLWF0bGFudGEtem9vLXRlc3QtcG9zaXRpdmUtMTUzOTI3OTY4Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gorillas at Atlanta zoo test positive for Covid,"Gorillas in their compound at Atlanta zoo (AP Photo/John Amis) (AP)

More than a dozen members of a gorilla troop at an Atlanta zoo have tested positive for the coronavirus.

Handlers at Zoo Atlanta noticed that a number of western lowland gorillas were experiencing mild coughs runny noses and slight loss of appetite so they collected fecal samples and tested the gorillas for disease.

According to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution 13 gorillas tested positive for Covid-19.

The report claims the disease was most likely transmitted to the gorillas from an asymptomatic worker who subsequently tested positive.

The employee was vaccinated according to a report. Zoo Atlanta’s policy requires all workers to wear gloves masks and face shields while on the job.

A Zoo Atlanta statement did not confirm how many of its gorillas are infected.

The Associated Press reported that a University of Georgia lab was analysing some samples and had returned positive Covid results for several gorillas.

Covid tests were also sent to the National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Amex Iowa. Zoo Atlanta is reportedly awaiting those results before definitively saying that the gorillas have Covid.

The Independent has reached out to Zoo Atlanta for comment.

All 20 gorillas living at the facility are now being tested for Covid.

There are four gorilla troops at Zoo Atlanta. According to the AJC members in each troop have shown signs of infection.

Zoo Atlanta spokesperson Rachel Davis told the AJC that employees are not mandated to take Covid vaccines but that a high percentage of staff have done so.

The zoo’s staff aren't the only ones to be vaccinated. Zoo Atlanta’s Bornean and Sumatran orangutans African lions clouded leopard and Sumatran tigers have all received the Zoetis vaccine which was developed for veterinary use.

Zoos in San Diego and Detroit have also vaccinated their at-risk animals.

This isn't the first time a group of gorillas has shown signs of coronavirus infection.

A troop of eight gorillas at San Diego Zoo Safari Park underwent treatment for the coronavirus in January. One of the park's silverback gorillas was even given an experimental regimen of antibodies according to National Geographic. All of the animals recovered.

Humans have been known to infect animals however the distance and barriers enforced by zoos means that transmission between species there is unlikely.

The US Centers for Disease Control has stated that animals are not a major contributing factor to spreading Covid to humans.

The western lowland gorillas were tested after keepers saw them coughing and other symptoms it said.

Initial tests indicated they were positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19 and the zoo said in a statement Friday it was awaiting the results of confirmatory tests from the National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Ames Iowa.

Gorillas at risk of developing complications were being treated with monoclonal antibodies and the zoo’s whole population of 20 gorillas was being tested.

“The teams are very closely monitoring the affected gorillas and are hopeful they will make a complete recovery. They are receiving the best possible care” said Sam Rivera senior director of animal health at Zoo Atlanta.

“We are very concerned that these infections occurred especially given that our safety protocols when working with great apes and other susceptible animal species are and throughout the pandemic have been extremely rigorous.”

The zoo said it believed the gorillas were infected by an asymptomatic keeper despite the employee being fully vaccinated and wearing personal protective equipment.

“While humans are known to be able to transmit the virus to animals such as gorillas and these cases have occurred at other zoos there is currently no data to suggest that zoo animals can transmit the virus to humans” the zoo said.

In any case it said visitors did not pose a threat due to the distance between them and the primates’ habitat.

The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that 13 of the zoo’s gorillas were infected including 60-year-old Ozzie the oldest male gorilla in captivity.

Rivera told the paper Ozzie was showing mild symptoms.

“We don’t feel that we’re out of the woods” he added. “We’re taking it on a day by day basis.”

Zoo Atlanta said it has been authorized to use the Zoetis Covid vaccine developed for animals and would inoculate the gorillas when they recover.

The zoo said it would also vaccinate its orangutans Sumatran tigers African lions and clouded leopard.

Covid-19 has also been known to infect domestic cats and dogs.
